The moment the tea touched my tongue, the world cracked. Not like glass. Like a spine.

The chamber shivered. My skin went cold. Then hot. Then—

**Falling.**

My chair vanished beneath me. The table, the Hatter, the red light—all of it vanished. Swallowed by ink. I plummeted through it like a ragdoll down an endless throat, gravity turning sideways, then inside out.

Shapes flickered past me—faces I couldn’t name, voices I thought I’d forgotten. The air buzzed with words I hadn’t spoken since childhood.

I screamed.

No one heard.

Then the screaming stopped. And I was above a dusty floor. My hands were small again. Dirty fingernails. Scuffed knuckles.

I was back in the Crooked House.

Back in a nightmare.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I stood on my tippy-toes, snatching a piece of parchment from the Wither Tree. The Ma’am had already used up all the parchment leaves from the lower branches, so I’d had to climb all the way up to the very top of the house—to the shambling tower that swayed with the wind. 

*“The Red Queen’s story is nearly finished,*” she’d told me through the crack in her study door, voice oddly bright. *“Go and fetch me another handful of pages. Be quick, Boy.”*

I’d hurried off, shaken by the sound of Carol groaning within. 

I didn’t know how she helped the Ma’am write—only that it drained her. Left her hollow and shaking, like the words were being pulled straight from her bones.

I gathered what leaves I could, brittle things with edges sharp as breath in winter, and began the slow descent down the spiral stairs. The steps whined beneath my feet. The tower *swayed*.

Light poured in through the gaps in the boarded windows, flickering stripes that danced across the rotting wallpaper like candlelight in a crypt.

Then it happened.

A shriek—high, inhuman, and *ending too quickly*.

My heart stuttered.

There was a blast of wings. Birds exploded from the trees beyond. The air cracked with sound: a snarl, then a roar like thunder through wet gravel. Something *snapped*—a jaw, a neck, I couldn’t tell—and then came the whimper. Gurgling. Wet.

I locked up.

My hands clutched the parchment like lifelines.

My feet crept toward the nearest window. The boards were old here, warped with rain. Gaps had opened over time. The Ma’am rarely came this high, so the wood had learned to breathe without her.

Peeking outside wasn’t allowed—it was one of the Ma’am’s Commandments**.** But the Ma’am was far below, whispering to Carol and her bleeding wrists.

So I looked.

My cheek touched the rotting wood, and I blinked as I stared through the gap in the boards. An ocean of trees stretched before me. Dark. Twisted. Endless. They seemed to writhe like living things, their leaves the ruddy color of autumn.

I shivered.

So that was the Thousand Acre Wood. The one the Ma’am warned us about. The one where the Hungry Things lived. The one where bad children went missing.

And then the forest moved.

A rumble rolled through the trees—not thunder. Not wind.

Something carving its way through the underbrush.

Massive.

The trees parted like curtains around a funeral procession. My breath caught. My fingers dug into the windowsill.

Another shriek. Sharp. Panicked.

Then a grunt.

Then steel through sinew—a wet, sickening crack.

And silence, just long enough to feel like prayer.

The ground shook, hard enough to rattle the tower’s bones. Like a giant had collapsed.

I watched. Frozen.

The garden below rippled as something emerged from the treeline.

A shape.

Hulking. Human-shaped. Wrongly proportioned. 

He moved like a statue learning to walk—each step a hammerblow. His shirt hung in tatters, soaked with gore. A massive axe rested across his shoulder, its blade caked in something black and steaming.

His face was shadowed beneath a curtain of tangled hair, but I saw his eyes.

Or rather, where they used to be.

Two sockets, hollow and cleanly carved, stared toward the Crooked House. Stared toward me. 

I gave a soft gasp. 

He turned—and behind him, dragging through the mud like a sacrificial offering, came a creature. Too large. Too wrong. Its antlered skull looked stitched together from animal parts. A beak jutted where its jaw should be. It hissed like steam from a broken pipe, lunged at the man—

The axe came down.

One clean motion.

The monster’s head flopped forward like a puppet losing its strings, eyes still twitching.

I yelped. Fell back. The parchment scattered like frightened birds.

“There you are.”

I flinched—expecting the Ma’am.

But it was only Carol.

Gran.

She stood in the doorway, silhouetted by dust and sunlight. One hand lifted in that familiar gesture—fingers brushing through my hair, warm and trembling.

“The Ma’am wondered what was taking you,” she said softly. “So she sent me to track you down.”

I scrambled to gather the fallen pages. “Sorry,” I blurted. “I didn’t mean to look. It wasn’t a long look.”

“It’s okay, Levi,” she murmured, crouching beside me. “You don’t have to be afraid of me.”

She kissed the top of my head.

Her lips were dry. Her breath smelled faintly of thyme and ink.

“Did you see him?” she asked. “Out there, I mean.”

I nodded, still rattled. “The Woodsman…”

Gran’s smile twitched faintly. “Yes. That’s what he calls himself now.”

“You know him?”

“I used to.” She reached for the parchment. Her sleeve slipped, revealing her forearm.

Wounds. Fresh. Still weeping.

I stared.

She adjusted the fabric quickly.

“He was like you,” she continued.

“One of the Ma’am’s stories?”

Gran nodded. “She wrote him a long time ago, before the Crooked House ever existed. It was he who built it. Every stair. Every floorboard. Every lock.”

I blinked. “Then why…?”

“He tried to protect me,” she said gently. “Tried to stop the Ma'am from drawing ink. So she wrote him out of our story.”

My throat tightened. 

“He leaves us gifts. Pieces of the monsters he kills. So we can use them in stew. So we can survive on more than the few cans stashed away in the basement.”

I looked back through the slats.

The Woodsman was already vanishing into the trees, dragging his axe behind him like a cross.

“He’s scary,” I whispered.

Gran’s gaze followed him.

“He is scary,” she agreed. “But that doesn’t mean he isn’t kind.”

She turned back to me with a small, sad smile.

“Now—hand those over. The Ma’am will be wondering where I’ve gotten to, and we don’t want her coming up here herself, do we?”

I shook my head fast.

I handed over the parchment.

“Gran… if the Ma’am’s almost finished writing the Red Queen… does that mean we’ll get to leave the Crooked House soon?”

She cupped my face. Her fingers were cold.

She smiled, but her eyes didn’t quite follow.

Then she turned without a word and limped toward the stairs, blood trailing down her arm in slow, deliberate lines. As she vanished into the dark below, she hummed one of her lullabies.

Soft. Shaky. Almost hopeful.

*Hush now, heart, the dark won’t bite,*

*I’ll hold your hand through one more night.*

*The teeth may snap, the lights may go,*

*But love remembers where we grow.*

*just breathe and you’ll be okay*

*…okay*

*…okay…*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My eyes fluttered open as the lullaby collapsed into static. Chamber 13 realigned, stone by stone.

The walls buzzed beneath flickering light. The Hare crouched beside me, his long fingers gently combing through my hair, like he was still trying to finish the song himself.

“Are you o-okay, Mister Levi?”

I scrambled backward on instinct, heart in my throat, blood drying on my temple.

The Hare flinched like I’d hit him. 

“I-I’m so sorry,” he whimpered, shrinking into himself. “It’s my fault. The Hatter… he gets out sometimes—more often these days. Doesn’t like hearing no. Doesn’t like waiting.” He tapped a finger against his skull. “He lives in here, see. N-not much room for privacy.”

I tried to breathe. Tried to speak.

“It’s okay,” I managed.

It wasn’t.

“I understand.”

I didn’t.

But the Hare brightened at my lie, and that was enough. If I could just keep this half—the harmless half—behind the wheel, maybe I still had a chance.

I eased back into my seat.

“I read about you,” I said. “In her journal.”

The Hare’s long feet thumped cheerfully as he crossed the room. “Yes, yes! I saw you reading.”

I blinked. 

Of course he had. The bloody words on the wall—*Do you dream of her too?*

That must have been him. 

Mister Neither, even after all these years, was still obsessed with Alice.

I swallowed. “Look—I don't think I'm supposed to be here.” I tapped my badge. “See? I’m not an Inquisitor, I’m just an Analyst… I’m not even permitted to talk to—”

The word ‘monsters’ hung on my lips. 

“—to friends?” the Hare finished, voice small. 

“Yeah...” I croaked, exhaling. “Friends. No talking to them. Not while I’m on the clock.”

I gave an uneasy chuckle.

It bent low, studying my feet. “That’s odd. It doesn’t look like you’re on a c-clock.”

“Hey—since we’re friends, maybe… you could do me a favor? Let me out the way you got in? I’ll go find the Inquisitor you *should* be meeting with.”

The Hare frowned. “But I don’t want an Inquisi-thingy. I want *you*.”

Shit.

“We can hang out again—sometime that’s, uh… less late in the evening.” I pretended to yawn—as if my adrenaline would allow it. “It’s just about bedtime for me.”

The Hare rose. His voice trembled. “You’re not… m-making excuses, are you?” He sniffled. “Because that wouldn’t be very nice. Friends shouldn’t lie.”

I raised my hands. “No. No, of course not—”

But it was already happening.

The Hare gripped his tophat. Screwed his face into a grimace. Bones cracked. His spine rippled beneath the suit, the back of his neck bulging like something trying to crawl out.

“He’s lying to you!” snarled a voice.

“G-Go away!” the Hare pleaded. “He wouldn’t lie to me. We’re f-f-*friends*…”

The Hare wheezed.

Then choked.

Then fought.

Then *changed*.

I lunged for the door. Twisted the handle.

Still locked. Still trapped.

“*Help!*” I screamed, slamming my fists against the wood. “Please—someone—”

A shadow stretched across the wall behind me. Heavy breath rasped inches from my neck.

“Well, well, well,” the Hatter growled. “Trying to leave already? How *terribly* rude.”

A hand like a meat hook seized my collar. Yanked. And I was airborne. The table struck me like a freight train. I skidded across it, then slammed into the wall with a crunch.

My ribs. God, something cracked.

I gasped.

Footsteps—no. Not footsteps.

Scrapes. Crawling.

The Hatter approached me like a predator through underbrush, his limbs too long, too eager. Light pulsed from beneath the brim of his hat. Searchlights in the shape of eyes.

“It seems,” he purred, dragging a claw across the concrete, “that our guest finds our hospitality lacking. Tsk. Tsk.”

He seized my hair. Hauled me upright. Raised the teacup. That awful, stained teacup.

“Perhaps,” the Hatter said, with a grin too wide, “he’d like… a little more tea?”

And then—*click.* The lock turned. The white door creaked open.

Silence fell like a knife.

The Hatter froze.

The man in the doorway didn’t belong.

But there he was—calm, centered, unmistakably real.

Gone was the hunched shuffle, the oversized suit, the bureaucratic nervous tics. The figure that stood in the frame was something else entirely. Trim. Broad-shouldered. Severe. The suit clung like armor. 

He looked like someone who didn’t just survive monsters—he hunted them.

My breath caught.

“Mr. Edwards…?” I choked, barely recognizing my own supervisor.

The Hatter turned, grinning with teeth like crooked knives. It uncoiled to its full, hideous height—neck hunched against the cracked ceiling, arms dangling like leashed weapons.

Edwards didn’t flinch. Didn’t blink. He didn’t even look at the creature.

“This little experiment is over,” he announced, voice cool and cutting—too much command for an Analyst. “We’re leaving, Reyes.”

I just stood there, jaw slack, the world teetering on a new edge.

The Hatter crept forward, dragging its claws along the floor. “I don’t care for interruptions. Not during teatime.”

“Reyes,” Edwards said again—firmer this time. “Move. Leave this thing to rot in its own madness.”

I staggered upright, legs shaking.

Black Victorian suit. Black tie. Silver chain at the hip. He wasn’t dressed like an Inquisitor.

He *was* one.

“Y-you’re…” I couldn’t even finish the thought.

Of everything I’d seen tonight—mutants, memories, monsters—this was the hardest to process. Mr. Edwards. Mild-mannered Mr. Edwards.

“An Inquisitor,” he confirmed, offering Mister Neither the briefest glance. “Yes. I had to stay hidden. To protect you. But that’s no longer an option. Owens accelerated our timeline, which means you’re going to have to make some difficult choices.”

“Difficult choices?” I echoed, blinking through the sting of dried blood. Then I shook my head. “Wait—protect me from who?”

The Hatter’s grin spread until it nearly split its skull. "You really haven’t figured it out yet, have you?" It leaned close, breath like rot and static. “He’s not here to protect you from *us*, Boy. He’s here to protect you—and everyone else—from *yourself*.”

My heart stuttered.

Owens' voice echoed in my mind—what she’d said to Edwards over the PA: *Let me clarify the stakes: either the Order ends tonight... or Reyes does.*

I turned to Edwards, desperate for answers, but he just glanced down the corridor—calm, detached, like he was waiting on a late package. 

The Hatter followed his gaze. "You think we'll just let you walk away with our newest toy?" It hissed, voice cracking at the edges. 

“Wasn’t asking,” he said, jerking his chin toward me. "I’m taking my subordinate. If you’ve got a problem, then you can file a complaint with the void."

The Hatter chuckled. Bent low. "You’re quite brave," it whispered, "for something so easy to snap."

Edwards ignored the comment, reaching into his coat to retrieve a silver pocketwatch. All Inquisitors carried them. 

He studied it, calm as a man waiting for a train.

The Hatter snatched it from him, peering into its surface with glowing eyes. “The harlot gave these trinkets to all her sycophants, didn’t she? Yes. We remember now… They sent messages with them. Is that what you were doing—begging for help?”

Edwards smiled. Just slightly.

“Actually,” he said. “I was just checking the time.”

The Hatter blinked.

A low buzz filled the hall.

Lights flickered.

And then—through the intercom, that same perky voice I’d heard in the elevator:

“STANDBY FOR REALITY ALIGNMENT. ENSURE ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE LOCKED.”

The Hatter straightened, snarling in confusion.

Edwards stepped to the side of the open door. “Nice meeting you.”

And then the storm hit.

The world ruptured.

A deafening cyclone howled through Chamber 13. The hallway beyond became a kaleidoscope of shrieking color, brickwork spinning into oblivion. Walls, wires, and pieces of corridor were torn apart like paper in a storm. Edwards pressed against the wall, gritting his teeth.

The Hatter barely had time to snarl.

Then it was gone—sucked through the open door like a corpse pulled from an airlock. One moment it stood poised to kill. The next, it was a smear in the screaming blur of the outside.

I clung to the table, knuckles white. Thank God it was bolted down. My ears rang. My ribs screamed.

This… this was Level 6. Just like the Jack had warned.

The Sub-Vaults didn’t stay in place. They flexed. Rearranged. Ate themselves whole.

Hallways dismantled. Floors rerouted. Reality realigned. Escape wasn’t just difficult—it was mathematically impossible.

And Edwards… he knew that.

That’s why he stood there. Calm. Unmoving. He was baiting the Hatter. Drawing it toward the door. Positioning it to be swallowed with the rest of the corridor. He wasn’t trying to get me to *leave*, just get close enough to the wall to avoid the worst of the vacuum. 

My lips parted in disbelief.

Genius. Insane, but genius.

A short, ragged laugh escaped me.

And then—

**“THOUGHT YOU WERE A FUNNY GUY, DID YOU?!”**

The voice struck like a sledgehammer. I turned—and horror took my breath.

A branch-like hand gripped the threshold. Fingers like twisted roots scraped against the floor. Edwards’ face went pale.

The Hatter was crawling back in.

Its claws sank into concrete, dragging its hulking form from the void in ragged bursts.

Edwards met my gaze, resignation filling his eyes. He pulled a playing card from his suit, stabbing it into the wall. “Reyes!” he bellowed. “This is for you!”

I stared back, haunted and confused. 

Something in me cracked then. I wanted to get to him—to cross the hurricane pulling apart the whole room and grab my supervisor before he did something stupid. Before he gave up. 

But all I could manage was: 

“Sir…?”

He didn’t belong in this nightmare. Not like this. But he’d stepped into it anyway.

For me.

Edwards smiled like he was already fading. 

“This is your story, Reyes. Write the ending you deserve.”

He gave me a short, two-finger salute. 

“Make it a good one.”

The Hatter's head twisted with a sickening crack, snapping sideways—unnatural. Wrong.

It stared directly at Edwards. 

**“HOW ABOUT A TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE?”**

It lunged—blurring forward like a guillotine. 

Edwards didn’t make a sound. There wasn’t any time.

One moment he was there—my anchor, my shield, the only person who seemed to know what the hell was going on. The next, he was in the Hatter’s grip.

And then he was gone. Hurled into the void with a sound like a snapped cable and a hurricane of brick and teeth and wind.

A minute later, silence fell. The storm faded.

The speakers crackled in the outside corridor. “**REALITY REALIGNMENT COMPLETE."**

The Hatter stood. Its searchlight eyes pulsed beneath the brim of its hat.

Then it turned, calm, collected. And slammed the door shut.

“Now then,” it said cheerily, the madness returning to its voice, “where were we?”

"Please—" I gasped. "Hare. I know you're in there."

Something flickered beneath the brim of the hat. The searchlight eyes dimmed. The grin faltered.

"It's me," I said, voice pleading. "Levi. Your friend. Remember?"

A low, guttural growl rattled from its chest.

"Stop," the Hatter hissed. "We aren't finished! We want him!"

But the smile kept twitching—tugging sideways, as if something inside was clawing for the surface. Bursting through like a child yanked from a bad dream. 

Mister Neither’s shoulders deflated.  

The brim of his top-hat lifted, revealing two mismatched eyes—one glassy button, one wet and mammal-bright.  “I c-c-can’t keep the Hatter leashed,” the Hare whispered, voice fluttering like a dying moth. “But I can give you truth.”  

He reached inside his coat and produced a battered playing card. No suit, no color—just a leering court-jester stamped in faded ink.  

“The deck rejected me,” he said, stroking the card’s edge with something close to reverence. “Called me a m-m-malfunction. A Joker.”  

I swallowed. The document I’d read in the typewriter: The Unwritten. Threat Class 10: Unfathomable. “You’re the Joker?”  

“O-One of them,” he said, pressing the card against my sternum. “A joke is never funny alone, is it?”  

His trembling fingers closed around mine, forcing me to feel the card’s dead weight.  

“Find the other,” he breathed, pupils dilating until they eclipsed the button eye entirely. “Together you can save the Deck. You can stop Alice’s d-dream from collapsing.”  

Before I could speak, the button-eye clouded over, the jaw distended, and the Hatter’s snarl re-latched onto his face—like a bear-trap triggered behind glass. 

Alice.

He’d said the one word the Hatter hated more than any other. 

Its whole body seized, spasming violently, limbs kicking at impossible angles.

Then—

*Snap*.

It hit the ground screaming.

“Don’t hurt my f-friend!” The Hare shrieked, tears pouring from its eyes. 

“FOR GOD’S SAKE!” the Hatter roared, plunging the hat down to cover its face. “He’s not our friend! He’s a LIAR! Just like the stupid GIRL!”

The Hare pushed through again, barely audible.

“I’m sorry M-Mister Levi. I’m trying but he’s—”

Another spasm. The eyes flashed bright. The Hatter roared, clawing at its own face. It tore fur from its skin—ribbons of flesh hanging wet from its cheeks. Blood splattered the floor.

“Stop!” the Hare sobbed through. “You’re h-hurting me!”

It wasn’t manipulation.

It wasn’t a trick.

The Hare was genuinely in agony.

The Hatter ripped again—more fur, more blood. Its body twitched with rage and hatred and something deeper. Something broken.

“We’re *protecting* you!” the Hatter hissed. “You *made* us do this! You *made* us! You made us! You made us!”

Then—it paused.

Panting. Twitching. Still.

And then it smiled slowly—with satisfaction. Its eyes flared bright. “There,” it purred, adjusting its jacket. “No more distractions. We’ve finally helped our weaker half see sense.”

No.

The Hatter hadn’t convinced the Hare. It had crushed him. Mutilated itself—tore at its own body—just to win the argument. Just for the privilege of making me suffer. 

This wasn’t madness. 

This was something worse—something so broken it could never be fixed. 

It stepped toward the table. Pulled out the opposite chair, and gestured for me to sit. 

There was nowhere to run, so I limped forward, ribs burning, and collapsed into the seat. The Hatter leaned in, casting a monstrous silhouette beneath the dying emergency lighting.

I glanced at the wall beside the door.

There—deep gouges in the concrete. Edwards’ fingernails. Where he’d tried to hold on. And his card he’d pinned to the wall, hanging like a lifeline I couldn’t reach. 

My chest cracked with something worse than pain. I wiped my face quickly, biting down a sob.

“Ohhh,” the Hatter cooed sweetly. “Do you miss your fwend?” Its sweetness evaporated with a snarl, dismissive and condemning. “Don’t cry, Boy. It makes you look *pathetic*.”

It held up the teacup. Twirled it between those long, awful fingers. “But since we're so nice, we've got *just* the thing to cheer you up. Secret family recipe.”

I stared numbly.

“Let me guess,” I croaked. “Another cup of my blood and tears?”

The Hatter gasped, offended. “That *hogwash*? No, no, no. Please. We'd never serve you *that* twice.”

It raised the cup to its own head—collected the Hare’s tears still clinging to its fur, the blood oozing from the fresh rips in its face. It swirled the mess once with a dirty fingernail and slid it across the table.

The contents shimmered dark red and silver. Hair floated on the surface. Bits of flesh. Something that might have been teeth.

My stomach turned.

"Drink," the Hatter growled. "You're at risk of offending your host."

I stared. Then smiled as I lifted the cup.

I’d let him think he'd won. Let him think he'd broken me.

But as I drank, I thought of every way I would make the Hatter pay.
