I was born in Manchester, though I’ve scrubbed the accent out like a bad stain. London does that to you. It reshapes the voice, polishes the manners, dulls the past. But deep down, I’m still that scrappy kid from Chorlton with a VHS collection and a hunger for horror.

Now I’m a film producer. Thirty-eight. Mid-tier success. You wouldn’t know my name unless you’re the type who sits through credits. But my fingerprints are all over the darker corners of British cinema—those slick, cerebral thrillers Netflix buries in the algorithm like cursed relics.

I was wrapping post on a formulaic supernatural flick—Ghost Circuit—when I got the call from Clara Wilton.

“Greg, darling,” she purred. “Got something mad for you. Real special. Off-market. Practically haunted.”

She always had a flair for the dramatic. Casting director turned script whisperer. She’d tossed me oddities before—scripts that stank of obsession and brilliance—but this one was different. I could hear it in her voice.

“What is it?”

“Unpublished script. Never produced. Came from the estate of Malcolm Pryce.”

I froze.

“Malcolm Pryce? The Malcolm Pryce?”

“The one and only. Man behind Dagger’s Wake.”

Everyone in the industry remembers Dagger’s Wake. A psychological horror from 1994, banned within weeks for allegedly triggering seizures and self-harm. Pryce never recovered. Retreated from the world, went mad, and died under mysterious circumstances.

A myth. A legend. A warning.

“What’s the script called?”

“The Final Cut.”

The silence between us buzzed.

“It’s about a producer from Manchester,” she continued. “Name of Greg Latham.”

My stomach turned cold.

“Same name, same job. It’s… him. You. It’s you, Greg.”

The script arrived in a battered envelope, no return address.

I opened it on my kitchen table, the London drizzle painting grey shadows on the floor. Inside: a stack of yellowed pages, handwritten in a jittery, obsessive scrawl. Ink bled in places like the page itself was sweating.

No title page. Just three words written in the top margin of page one:

THE FINAL CUT   
by Malcolm Pryce

And the first line:

INT. FLAT – NIGHT

A film producer, GREG LATHAM (late 30s, from Manchester), stares at a mysterious script that reflects his own life—word for word, scene by scene.

I kept reading.

Scenes mirrored events from my recent weeks. An argument with a cinematographer. A café I’d visited in Soho. Even the layout of my flat.

I didn’t know what disturbed me more—the script’s accuracy, or its tone. It wasn’t written like a screenplay. It read more like a ritual. Each scene was tighter than the last, each line more suffocating. The deeper I read, the more I felt like I was remembering it rather than reading it.

In the third act, Greg realizes the script is alive. It rewrites itself in real-time. It shows him scenes from the future. His own death.

And in the final scene:

INT. FLAT – NIGHT   
Greg sets up a camera. He films his own final monologue. As he finishes speaking, a figure steps into frame behind him.   
Greg doesn’t react. He already knows who it is.

I dropped the pages. My chest was tight. My pulse sounded wrong in my ears—like it wasn’t syncing with my heartbeat.

But despite the dread clawing at my spine, one thought kept pushing through:

This is the most brilliant horror film I’ve ever read.

I started pre-production the next week.

I told myself I was doing it for art. That this would be my legacy project. But the truth was simpler: I had to. The script was inside me now, whispering behind every thought.

I assembled a small team. Kept things quiet. I didn’t want it tainted by studio notes or marketing demands. No streaming deals. No trailer campaigns. Just the story, told properly.

We shot in an abandoned theatre in Hackney, dressed to look like my own flat. We rebuilt my living room down to the cracked tea mug and leaning bookshelf. I gave the costume designer my clothes.

Ellis Carr, the actor I cast as “Greg,” was disturbingly perfect. He mimicked me with uncanny precision. Even started speaking in my voice off-camera.

“You don’t just play a man,” he said once during rehearsal. “You become the story he wrote for himself.”

That line wasn’t in the script. But I found it later—handwritten on the last page.

Then the anomalies began.

Rough cuts included footage we never filmed. Just a few seconds at first—an angle we didn’t shoot, a line no one remembered writing. Then whole scenes appeared. I confronted my editor, but he swore he hadn’t touched anything.

Once, while reviewing footage, I saw Ellis walk down my real street—not the set.

The camera followed him into my actual building.

Up the stairs.

To my flat.

He knocked on the door.

And I—the real me—opened it.

I don’t remember filming it. I don’t remember doing it.

The timestamp said: “Recorded: 03:11 AM.”

That’s when I started unplugging everything.

I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. I would catch reflections of Ellis in mirrors, even when I was alone. My phone began showing me notifications for videos I hadn’t recorded. One showed me, sleeping. Another: me brushing my teeth—but there was a second shadow behind me.

Once, I found the script on my desk again, open to a page I swear didn’t exist before. It simply read:

YOU ARE THE FOOTAGE NOW.

I tried burning the script.

The next morning, the pages were back on my desk—unburned, smelling faintly of ash.

I fled to Manchester. Booked a flat on Deansgate. No internet, no camera. I tried to forget the project. But the city no longer felt like home. My reflection in the shop windows was always slightly off.

The script followed me there.

New pages would appear each night. A line would change. A scene would vanish, then reappear—with me in it. A version of me that smiled too much. Blinking at the wrong rhythm.

Three weeks ago, I checked the hard drives again. They were blank.

Completely wiped.

But when I plugged them into my laptop, a folder appeared.

/FINAL\_CUT

Inside: the entire film—complete. Edited. Scored. Color-graded. But with one terrifying difference.

I wasn’t watching Ellis anymore.

The actor playing me was… me.

My voice. My face. Not just close—identical. It wasn’t CGI. It wasn’t deepfake. It was me in scenes I had never lived.

In the final scene, I sit on the sofa. A camera rolls. I speak a monologue—words I’ve never said aloud.

“I was never writing the story. The story was writing me. It needed a vessel. It found one. And now…”

A figure steps into frame behind me.

I smile.

I don’t turn.

I just whisper: “Cut.”

I tried sending it to a friend at the BFI.

He watched half, then blocked me. His assistant sent me a message: “What you’ve made is not a film. It’s a trap.”

I deleted the file. Smashed the drives.

The next morning, my TV turned on by itself.

The film played.

I haven’t left this flat in nine days. My reflection watches me even when I’m still. The mirrors have gone foggy. My phone records audio while powered off. I heard whispering in it last night.

Last week, I saw Ellis—or something wearing his face—outside the building.

He didn’t knock.

He smiled. Then walked away.

Now the script ends with a new page. Fresh ink.

INT. GREG’S FLAT – NIGHT   
The producer finishes his story. He turns around.   
The camera keeps rolling.   
He doesn’t scream.

I can hear the camera clicking in the other room. But I didn’t set it up.

I’m not writing this for help. I just want a witness.

If you see a film called The Final Cut—don’t watch it.

Because once you do…

It starts rewriting you.
