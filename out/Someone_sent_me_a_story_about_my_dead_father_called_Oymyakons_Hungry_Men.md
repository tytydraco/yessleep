When I was about five or six my dad disappeared. My mom always said he died, but never gave any good explanation into how. She told me he was on a research trip somewhere in Russia. I don’t remember much about him, just that he had a contagious laugh, and a hug that could fix absolutely everything. 

Today, almost 15 years later, I received a journal in my mailbox. Mom put it in there, told me someone had dropped it off at the old house and it was for me. She didn’t say from who, because she didn’t know. Just said it was on the front porch with my name on it. 

Now, what I read was a demented story about my father. None of which I think is true. Maybe it’s some prank from one of the kids next door- I don’t know. I’d let mom look at it, but I don’t want her reading this… I can’t fit it all in here, so I’ll have to add the rest later. Any thoughts on what this could be about would be really helpful, thanks. 

“The brutal chill of the night reminded me of my naivety. Days turned into weeks, and all that I had left was a scant pile of food. I’d blown through a month’s worth of rations with ease.

I stared down at my shaking hands, maimed from the wilderness. My skin split from the frozen mountain air and left saharan-like cracks across my knuckles. Scabs formed over the tiny cuts and reopened every time I made a fist. I held them in front of the woodstove, hoping to alleviate my aches. The fire cracked furiously, emitting a nauseating heat that made the room practically intolerable.

Outside the cabin walls, a violent blizzard transpired. The windows rattled with anger, and air made its way through the cracks of the cabin. The dropping temperature was far more concerning than the snow. If I were to step outside, my blood would freeze in a matter of minutes. I couldn’t leave, even if I wanted to. 

Sitting in the corner was an elderly man who spoke few words, most of which were hateful.

“You must eat.” Viktor, the man in his late 80s, stated. His voice was thick and coated in mucus.  I kept my gaze low, focused on the woodstove in front of me. 

“No.”

“Yes.”

“I’m not interested.” He scoffed at my defiance. 

“It will only get worse from here.” He grumbled in annoyance. His accent was heavy and difficult to understand. 

I scooted closer to the fire, my feet nearly pressed against the iron stove.

Viktor rhythmically knocked his cane against the floor. The humdrum of the tapping was soothing in comparison to the screechy creaks of the cabin. My hand trailed to my right leg as I leaned forward. I felt heat emitting from my jeans as I held a hand over the aching limb.

“Connor.” I turned my head toward the old man. A sigh left his brittle lips. His tongue wetted the dry skin on his mouth before he spoke. I stared at his face, wrinkled like a crumbled piece of paper. 

“You must eat. If not now, soon.” 

“I can’t.” His cane tapped the floorboard in annoyance. 

He scrunched his mouth up to his nose and shook his head. His white hair puffed around him and cascaded down the front of his shirt. 

“Die. I don’t care.” My grip on my leg tightened, and I dropped my gaze. 

I felt my face get hot as I boiled with anger. I let out a deep breath and closed my eyes. The heat from the fire fueled my overwhelmed nature.

“I’ll eat tomorrow,” I whispered, trying to hide my animosity.

“Tomorrow it is.” I could hear a sly smile in his voice. He was pleased with himself, like he’d won some shitty prize. The old man rose with a groan. His joints cracked loud enough for me to wince. The ground squeaked under his wobbly gait as he walked toward me.

“Remember… Shut the curtains.” I didn’t respond to his reminder, too distracted by the fire dancing in front of me. His cane knocked against my back with a loud crack.

“Shit…” I muttered, rubbing the sore spot in my spine. “I will.”

“Watch your mouth.” The man hissed. He slowly turned around and hobbled away. 

“Do you need help?”

“Don’t act like you care.” His voice was laced with venom. He left the living room and slammed the door behind him. Viktor ran off to do God knows what in his bedroom. He left me to my devices, planted right in front of the roaring stove. There was no denying that Viktor was tired of the ungrateful little shite I had been. 

In my solitude, my mind wandered. How much longer till I could leave? He hadn’t told me anything remotely relevant to my research. There was no real reason for me to stay any longer. I nudged the fire with a poker, and embers spat at me. 

Playing into the old man’s delusions was starting to wear me thin. He was particular, had many rules, and made sure I followed them to a T. Over time, I realized nothing was worth having to endure life inside a primordial cabin. 

My stomach grumbled in anger, and I winced. I dropped the fire poker and held my hand over my aching belly. Viktor was right, I had to eat eventually. I fantasized about the pot of stew he left on the counter. 

The smell tickled my nose and left a pit in the bottom of my stomach. From what Viktor was telling me, that pot of food was a flesh-eater’s wet dream. Something had to give; I couldn’t rely on my meager rations for much longer.

I rose to my feet and let out a labored breath. The pot of food sat on the counter and stared at me. One bite would be enough to eradicate years of discipline. 

My hands were pinned to my side as I took short steps toward the bait. Steam rose off the substance, swirling into the air. Inside was an amalgamation of various meats, submerged in a thick, dark gravy. 

Blood sausages and indistinguishable cubes of meat poked out of the sauce. Excessive amounts of saliva built up in my mouth. I sucked up the spit before my drool mixed with the so-called ‘stew’. 

There was no stopping me. Like mad, I dug my grimy hands inside the pot and felt a sausage squelch between my fingers. My teeth popped the casing, and the mince crumbled into my mouth. A quiet moan escaped my lips as I lowered my head.

God, that was the first time I had meat in years. It danced over my tongue, and when I swallowed, I felt the warmth travel through my throat into my belly. 

I was surprised I didn’t empty the contents of my stomach right on that shitty hardwood floor. It was greasy and had a pungent odor. I wasn’t revolted.

I was addicted. 

My fingers dug back into the pot and reached for a cube of meat. I felt the tender flesh melt into my mouth, and another grumble of a moan escaped my lips. I licked the gravy off my fingers and closed my eyes.

My chest heaved up and down as I rested my hands on the countertop. The contents of my belly stirred in excitement. A burp left my mouth as I backed away. 

No more. 

I took a moment to collect myself. What had I done? Sure, I only stopped eating meat because Kate was a die-hard vegan, but still. That was my way of life for so long, and I just caved so easily.

I knelt and opened the cabinet. I grabbed a lid, covered the pot, and pushed it so it was flush with the wall. The smell was far more manageable than before. Guilt hung around in my belly and festered like fungus. I combed my hand through my hair and felt remnants of gravy hang on the strands. 

“Jesus fuck.” I whispered to myself. The floor creaked with each step I took. I knew the old man heard me mucking about. He knew what I’d done and how weak I was. He knew that I didn’t have the control that I let on. He was right. I think he was always right about me.

I stopped in front of the only window in that cabin.

A thick, icy layer of snow decorated Viktor’s front porch. Past that, I could see nothing. Darkness sucked up all that was outside, shrouding everything in a thick veil. Furious wind rattled the cabin and found its way inside. If one stood close enough to the wall, they would feel its icy touch. No light from the moon graced the tundra; God had forgotten us.

My fingertips pressed against the glass pane, and I longed to talk to the people of Oymyakon. I needed to know more about the subarctic land. Viktor was a poor conversationalist who gave me no beneficial information. All I had were the anecdotes of a hermit. My research was no longer of importance, and no matter how much I needed to learn more, it was fruitless. 

The cold from outdoors trailed down my arm; the blood in my veins boiled no more. My turning stomach eased, as I let out a heavy sigh of relief.  I could have sat there with a hand pressed against that glass all evening. Eventually, I pulled away, knowing that Viktor would blow a gasket if he saw me.

I made my way to the couch and sat down. The cushion felt like a brick under my sore ass. I rested my head on the shitty pillow Viktor gave me and let out a sigh. My eyes closed, and I begged for sleep to take me. Behind my eyelids, dancing colors decorated a black backdrop. I would entertain myself with the firework show of phosphenes. In due time, I would drown in an ocean of melatonin.

But until then, my mind would wander. What day was it? I knew weeks had passed, but my mind was far too jumbled to make sense of dates. Christmas was coming up. Sweet little Rosie and her fiery ringlets. She would run from downstairs and jump right into my arms. I’d take her outside and show her the bike Kate and I bought her. We’d have the Christmas dinner that we all cooked together. My mother and father would gawk at Kate’s excessive decor and bitch about something. It would have been nice to see them together again. 

I brought a hand up to my cheeks; they were wet with emotion. The tears wiped away with ease, and I squeezed my eyes shut. A shaky breath escaped my lungs. I needed to calm down. There was no sense in making myself miserable. 

The windows rattled angrily, nearly broken by the force of the wind. The front door shook, threatening to come right off the hinges. Cold air burst through the cabin and rushed over my exposed skin. My body went rigid as a burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. Stiff as a board, and quiet as a mouse. I could not move; I could not breathe.

The floorboards creaked with each passing moment. My tear-stained cheeks froze from the chill of the night as I lay still. Something was inching towards me; I felt it caress my aching body. Dizziness ensued as I struggled with inconsistent, labored breaths. 

My eyes shot open. They were wide with surprise as I glanced around the dark room. To my shock, nothing waited for me. The musty room was still filthy and still empty. I flopped onto my back and stared at the ceiling. 

How much longer until I officially lose it? The walls would come in on me if I stayed in them any longer. My soul had been crushed by the torment of being stuck in a cage for weeks on end. 

With a heavy heart, I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the unrelenting urges that taunted me. Rest was a natural cure for all ailments. The sandman would best my hunger, my pain, my fear, and most importantly, my desires. He came for me not too long after, and I was lulled into a deep sleep.

“Are you stupid?” Something whacked across my shin. I winced and pulled away. The old man gave me a pleasant wake-up call.

“What?” 

“Stupid and deaf.” The old man scoffed. He drew the curtains closed and turned to me. 

“Keep the curtains drawn at night.” He nudged me with the cane again.

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be sorry. Quit doing it.”

“I will.” A deep frown sat on my face. He shook his head at me and sighed.

“Louzy.”

The old man walked toward the counter as he leaned on his cane. His raglike clothing wafted a smell of musk across my nose. I grimaced and lowered my head. Viktor let out a grumble and jabbed his cane into the floor.

“I see.”

“I’m sorry?” I looked at him with furrowed brows. 

“Hunger bested you.”

Humiliated, I averted my eyes from him. It was clear that I had no will. 

“There’s no shame in eating. You had to eventually.” Viktor grumbled. He stepped away from the counter and cleared his throat.

“Connor.” He gave me an indistinguishable look. His beard was long and hadn’t seen a pair of scissors in ages. He leaned to the side, with a slight preference for his left leg, as he walked. He lowered himself into the wooden chair across from me with a groan and licked his lips.

“I am here to help you.” He stopped for a moment to settle into his chair before continuing.  “You came to me, no?” His furry white brows raised with his question.

“I suppose I did.” 

“Then why don’t you trust what I say?”

“You won’t tell me anything.” His patience was wearing thin, as was my sanity. Any longer with this violent old man, and I’d lose my mind. He scoffed and looked toward the wood stove. The color orange danced across his pale skin. It made the wrinkles on his face deepen and add another ten years to him.

“In due time.” He muttered. My face scrunched up like I just ate a sour candy. I found it hard to stifle my feelings of aggravation. 

“How did you sleep?” Viktor asked. When I sat up, my nerves jolted alive, and the aches ensued. My legs throbbed, and searing blood pumped to my feet. 

“Fine.” My voice petered out. He scoffed and flared his nostrils. He said something in Yakut under his breath. I wanted to ask what, but I knew I’d get a lashing for the nosiness. I wasn’t sure why he asked; it’s not like he really gave a shit. 

His eyes drifted to the closed window, and he nearly rolled his eyes. Viktor hobbled to the curtains and snatched a piece of the cloth into his hands. 

“Манна баар этэ.” He sniffed the curtain and flicked it away.

“I know why,” Viktor announced. I furrowed my brows and watched as he turned toward the tiny kitchen. He tottered over to the cupboards and bent down with a grunt. In his hands was a small container of salt. He hurried to the window, laid out a thick line of salt, and did the same to the front door.

“Why-”

“Come, look.” He set the container down on the end table and held the cloth out for me to look at.

“This is why we keep the curtains closed at night.” 

“See.” He pointed. I got up with a groan and shuffled toward the old man. His stench forced me to breathe through my mouth.

“I don’t…’ He grunted and pointed again. I squinted my eyes. The ends of the curtains were covered in filth. The once white doily drapes were tainted with streaks of grime. I didn’t say anything. That’s just the product of time. If we’d inspected them the day before, they’d look the same.

“These curtains are from my wife. Careless Bastard.” He tossed them to the side and shook his head. I licked my dry lips and dropped my gaze to the floor.

“Are you sure they weren’t always like that?” You would have thought I shot the old fart. He looked at me wildly before shaking his head.

“Yes. Positive.” He grumbled.

“Then… Shouldn’t we be worried about what did that?” Victor shrugged and waddled over to his chair. The wood groaned underneath his weight, and he glared at me.

“It is but a symptom of the cause.” 

“What is?” Would this old fuck tell me something, anything?

“I cannot tell you.” I shook my head and sat back down on the couch.

“Why?” 

“I cannot say its name, quit with the questions.”

“I’m confused.” His cane crashed into the wooden floor, and he roared in annoyance.

“Do not be surprised when you run away from the world, and the evils of it find sanctuary where you find solitude.” I opened my mouth to speak, but he held up a finger.

“It knows you are here, and it wants you.” His finger dropped, and he cleared his throat.  “It will keep coming, no matter what.”

“Forever?” I asked

“I don’t know.”

“I thought you knew everything?” He grumbled at my question, refusing to respond. My socks made a muffled thud every time I tapped the floor with my foot. The rhythm soothed my rising feelings of frustration.

“So… is this… thing… a part of some folktale of sorts?” The old man paid no attention to my question and picked at the handle of his cane with a pocketknife.

“I don’t know… is it?” He asked me instead. My teeth ground together in annoyance.

“I’m asking you.”

“Is it supposed to be a leshy?” He nearly laughed at my suggestion. 

“There is no name for this thing; not one that anyone from this century would know. It is something the townspeople and I have come to accept… To adapt with…” If the old man was right, then I apparently didn’t deserve a warning. Our eyes met, and he gave me a hard look of sincerity. 

That’s when it hit me. That’s when it slapped me right in the side of the face and rolled my eyes all around my skull. This man was dead serious.

“It’s a folktale, right… Not real…” I shook my head as I stood.

“All of it. All of it is real. If you aren’t careful, you will find out how real .” He nearly snarled at me. 

“I wanted a story for my thesis, not to be fucking trapped with some delusional old man.” My heart raced as I backed toward the door.

“Do not.” He struggled to stand up. 

“Эн абааһынан бэлиэтэммиккин.” Viktor pointed his mangled finger at me as spit flew out of his mouth.

“Just let me leave. I’ve got all the information I need.” My voice trembled as I inched closer to the door.

“No.”

“No?”

“You heard me. No.” His face was stern, and a scowl rested atop folds of wrinkles.

“You can’t keep me here.” I barked. My back grazed the door, and he gave me a look that screamed for me to stop. 

“You are foolish! You are reckless!” The old man screamed. His saliva painted my cheeks as he slammed his cane down, barely missing me. A loud thudd bounced off the walls. He wobbled from side to side and tried to raise the cane. I scrambled for the door handle, and he stopped himself. Regret painted over his face, and he took a step back. It took him a moment to collect himself, but he eventually spoke between heavy breaths.

“You will die out there.” He reasoned, with his hand outstretched.

“And I won’t in here?”

“It is below 50 out. You will freeze in minutes.” 

“I’ll get my gear and leave. I promise I can be out of here in seconds.” The old man shook his head at my suggestion. My heart dropped into my stomach as I pressed my back closer to the door.

“Your gear, it cannot stand to what is outside.” He reasoned.

“I think I’ve overstayed my welcome…” He had to let me go. 

“A storm is coming.”

“How do you know?”

“I have lived here my whole life, that is how I know. Your bones ache, your joints feel like they will crush under the pressure. It is not safe for you to go.” He leaned on the cane and grimaced. Our rapport was coming to an end; his mind had been made up.

“Please. You can go tomorrow, yes?” Viktor suggested.

“I…” I trailed off and looked to the side. My hand was wrapped around the handle of the door.

“Tomorrow I can answer any questions you have. Yes.” He nodded slowly and gestured for me to come away from the door. I opened my mouth to speak, but didn’t.

“You’re writing something.” He swallowed as his eyes darted from me to the door. 

“I can help.” I felt like I had gotten whiplash from his sudden soft nature. 

“I will not hurt you. That is a promise.” He held up a hand and backed away from me.

“I’m an old man, remember.” He stated. I nodded, and so did he. 

“I just need you to listen to me. Okay? Hear me out, maybe?” He suggested, and I nodded again. He walked over to his chair and sat down, evidently exhausted from standing. I stayed close to the door, and he simply watched me.

“Did you see something out there?” He asked. I thought to myself for a moment. Something lunged at me the night I made it to the cabin, nothing but a wolf… or something.

“An animal. Maybe. It was a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t get a good look at it…” I reasoned. 

“I’ve seen your leg.” He looked up at me. If I wasn’t mistaken, he looked almost remorseful. What did he mean he saw my leg?

“It looks angry. Needs cleaned.” I haven’t taken my pants off since I’ve got here, except to shit and piss. 

“What are you-” He lifted his own pant leg. Staring at me was a mangled ankle, covered in scar tissue. Two long divots were embedded in his flesh as veins escaped from the old wound. Around it were cut marks, as if he had sawn away his own flesh.

“It’s only a scratch.” I reasoned.

“Did that ‘animal’ scratch you?” 

“Yeah- I mean barely.” 

“Then that’s enough.” My lips parted, and my brows furrowed.

“You seem fine.” He nodded at my observation.

“Yes. I fought the urge.”

“What urge?”

“The urge to go outside.” 

He was being sincere. He believed every single thing he told me. 

I folded my arms in front of my chest and slowly inched toward the couch. 

“It still stalks this land; we are in its territory. You must know we are the outsiders. We are in its home.” The look in his eye was crazed and distant. He shook with each word he spoke, spit dribbling down his mouth.

“We can go back to town together,” I suggested.

“I know what I speak of is real.” He shook his head and sighed.

“Why do you stay here then?”

“I cannot leave.”

“Why?”

“It is the right thing to do.” Viktor danced around the truth and refused to reveal anything substantial to me. I could ask him a million different questions, and he’d still find a way not to answer. 

He looked me up and down and tapped his foot. His nose scrunched as if he smelled something putrid. I fiddled with my hands, refusing to look him in the eye. My gaze shifted to the door, and Viktor took notice.

“Would you like to bathe yourself?” He asked. 

“You have water?” He laughed.

“I can boil some for you and give you a rag. ”

“Sure.” I watched as he stood with a grunt. It took him a few moments to collect all of the materials for the makeshift bath. With a pot filled with snow, he struggled to the woodstove. I offered to help, but he declined. Apparently, he could go outside, but I couldn’t? Smells like a bullshit excuse to keep me there. He was lonely, his wife was probably dead, and he had no one. Hell, I would have probably done the same. No one wants to spend the rest of their life in a frozen wasteland alone. 

After several minutes, steam from the water clouded the room. It made the air heavy and filled my nose with cotton balls.

“I’ll grab you some clothes,” Viktor muttered as he vanished into his bedroom. 

My gaze shifted to the door once more. I was quicker than him, oh, I could have left right then.

Viktor hobbled back into the living room, his usual look of disdain plastered across his face. He wouldn’t have survived a life in the theatre. Viktor handed me the clothes, and I took them into my calloused hands. 

“Enjoy.” I nodded and set the clothes into the crook of my arm. The heat of the wood stove suffocated me the closer I got. I reached to grab the pot and immediately winced.

“Fuck!” The skin on my hands screamed in searing pain. The old man laughed, and I glared at him. What a dirty old bastard.

I muttered a few obscenities under my breath, took the clothes he gave me, and used them as pot holders. Carefully, I made my way to the bathroom with the pot in hand. Every few seconds, bits of boiling water splashed onto my foot, and I’d grit my teeth in pain. The steam made it impossible to clear the small distance. Consequently, I received a few more burns. 

Once I finally made it to the bathroom, the pot dropped on the floor with a thud as I let out the breath I held. Steam rolled off the boiled water and encapsulated the room. 

Peeling off my top was a challenge. The shirt had nearly fused with my freeze-dried skin.  I winced in pain as the fabric snagged a few scabs that formed alongside my back. I let out a sigh of relief as I discarded the rancid to the side. 

My hands toyed with the hem of my jeans as I anticipated a task far worse in comparison. I pulled down my underwear and pants; to my surprise, they came off with no issue. My jeans were shucked off and kicked away from me.

I pulled the only stool in the room over. Its legs scratched into the wood, leaving tiny marks in the floorboards. The antique stool creaked under my weight as I sat down with a grunt. 

The smell of the room was pungent; a grotesque mix of decayed wood and body odor. A scowl sat permanently on my face as I inspected the length of my body. From nearly head to toe, I was covered in an impenetrable grime; eons of dirt packed on my skin in layers. 

With a few swipes of the wet rag, streams of dirt trailed down my legs onto the floor. Dank water pooled around my malformed feet. My toenails had been smashed from hiking boots that were far too small. Popped blisters covered my heels and the balls of my feet. I denied myself the luxury of picking at the skin; infection was a guarantee out here. 

More of the filth poured down my pasty skin. Slowly, my old flesh was becoming more apparent. The rag squelched against my skin as I dragged it up from my ankle. Underneath a layer of muck was a congealed mess of blood and hair. I leaned forward, poking at my right calf. The wound was far worse than I had imagined. I hadn’t dared to look at it since I’d made it to the cabin.

The rag drifted over the scratch on my leg, and I hissed in pain. Viktor was right. It was furious. Dark veins that looked like scratches of graphite danced under my skin. They trailed up my calf all the way to my groin. The wound was a deep shade of plum, one that I had never seen accompanying an injury. A thick leather-like scab formed over the top, covering the wound entirely. Still, it had its own heartbeat, throbbing every time I tried to wipe away the dirt. I let out a shaky sigh, dizzy from the pain.

I sat there, in a pool of my own dried blood, muck, and grime, and shrank into myself. Was it worth it, leaving my wife and kid, my family? Was it worth it traveling thousands of miles to the middle of butt-fuck nowhere? Was it worth it, losing a piece of myself, to the wild?

I was an impoverished assistant professor trying to finish my dissertation. It’d taken me years of saving to even get to Oymyakon. I wasn’t some well-established researcher with the assets of a billionaire. I was just a measly, pathetic man who was desperate to experience a world outside of civilization. Being miles away from working toilets and electric heated houses made me regret every decision I had made thus far.

It took me ten or so painful minutes of scrubbing to clear away all the filth. The heat of the rag, water, and room started to get to me, along with my self-deprecating thoughts. I felt myself droop forward and had to stop periodically to catch my bearings. The room spun around me like I’d downed tens of beers. A thick film of sweat formed on my forehead and dripped down my cheek. Nausea pulled at my stomach as I tried to stand and haphazardly swayed from side to side. The rag dropped to the floor with a splat as I fell toward the sink. I steadied myself, and the cold steel soothed my seething hands. With heavy breaths, I tried to calm myself. 

Eyes met my own in the mirror hanging on the wall. The man who stared back at me was a stranger. His eyes were hollow, and his cheeks were gaunt. All of the meat I had on my bones had sloughed off over the weeks.  I dragged a rough hand over my face and watched the skin stretch with ease. I showed my teeth, snarling at my reflection. They were yellowed and glared at me. I was reminded of my newly feral nature.

“Jesus,” I whispered to myself as I stepped away from the mirror. 

In the reflection, behind me, bouquets of dried flowers hung off the wall. Arrangements of mugwort, iris, dandelions, and bluebells stared back at me. Underneath was a shaky wooden table with a framed photo of an elderly woman. Beside the photograph was a whittled wolf made of dark wood. I decided I’d spent enough time gawking at the old man’s knick-knacks and should start dressing myself.

Putting on my clothes while nauseated was practically impossible. I fell from side to side as I tried stepping into the pair of pants Viktor provided. They were tight around my thighs, the fabric nearly splitting in two. The sweater he gave me was scratchy and smelled of stale bread. I threw it on, grimacing at the feeling of wool on my wet skin. 

Once I opened the door to the living room, a waft of icy air engulfed me. A sigh of content escaped my lips; no more was my body a flame. My eyes glanced around the room in anticipation; it was empty.

There was no sign of Viktor, and no prepared meal. A frown set on my face as hunger lingered in the depths of my belly. I rested a free hand over my stomach and grimaced at the wool scratching my palm. Fire from the wood stove cracked, serving as the only sound in the cabin. Heat from it crept across the room, excusing the draft from the front door. Daylight slinked through the slit of the curtains onto the hardwood floor. A sliver of light crawled through the room onto my foot. Sunlight, on my needy flesh. I closed my eyes. 

I was only a few steps away from being outdoors. Outside, travelling birds who endured the Arctic winds would sing praises of my escape. Wolves would yip and howl together, adding bass to the lifted sounds of the tundra. I would run, with the wind splitting my skin and the sun burning my face. God would see my resilience, and he would recognize the horrors I had endured. 

He would reward me with a belly full of stew and a life of never-ending pastries. Kate would never go hungry, Rosie would never be bored, and I would never be lonely. It would be a life well-deserved, after all of this.

I dropped my head and opened my eyes. A part of me thought that somehow, I would have been outside. What a foolish juvenile thought. Still, I stood in a stranger's home on the outskirts of a small, forgotten village, no closer to my salvation. 

There would be no saving grace; there would be no God.

Viktor’s bedroom swung open. My brows furrowed as I watched him fall into the living room. He clasped his chest, struggling to keep himself upright. His liver-spotted hand grabbed the arm of the couch for leverage as his face contorted in pain. Grunts escaped his mouth. He banged his cane against the floor with a force that nearly broke the wood underneath it.

I stepped toward him, hoping to steady his unreliable stance.

“Stop!” He wailed. 

“Back.” He waved a hand at me.

“Bottle. Hand me bottle.” He pointed his cane at the dining table behind me. I turned around, quickly trying to find what he was gesturing at.

“NOW.” I grabbed the bottle with haste, opened it, and took a single pill out. Then, I handed it to the struggling man. He clamored to drop it into his mouth and fought to swallow it. He leaned his back against the wall and took in a few deep breaths.

“I’m lying down. Leave me alone.” His voice was weak, barely audible.

“Are you okay-” He cut me off with a stern voice.

“Leave me alone. Stay in here.” He demanded. Viktor shook as he tried to open the door behind him. I grabbed the knob and pushed it open. He muttered no thank yous, no goodbyes; he just left. I watched as the door slammed in my face. The weak sounds of a frail old man struggling to his bed were emitted through the door. His cane fell to the ground with a loud bang. The bed springs squeaked as groans left his feeble body. 

That door was going to be shut for a long while. I slowly backed away, registering what had just happened. Viktor seemed incredibly unwell, and my first instinct was to pry. I had to remind myself that this man was my captor, not a sick grandparent. This was my only chance for a life outside walls.

I rushed to the old man’s closet. It opened with a piercing creak. My eyes scanned the cramped room for anything that could be used for warmth. I pulled out two coats and my tiny pair of hiking boots. Inside my shoes were a pair of crusty old socks. I unrolled them and forced the socks and boots onto my maimed feet. 

It took a lot of grunting and grimacing to squeeze into those torturous shoes. 

The old man’s jacket fit like a glove and hugged my biceps. It constrained some of my larger movements, but contained the heat of my body. My old coat slid right over the top with ease. I let out a shallow breath as my face flushed from the excessive heat. Then, I bent over and groaned as I tried to pick up my wadded gloves. 

In no time, my body was bound like a sausage roll, ready to pop if I took too deep a breath. The hood of my jacket hung over my head, obscuring some of my vision. A thick wool scarf covered my runny nose and chapped lips. My eyes would be the only things exposed to the harsh elements.

I reached for the doorknob and momentarily stopped myself. 

Maybe it *was* too dangerous to leave? Maybe Viktor was being sincere? Surely this was just the ramblings of a deranged man. Somehow, in his mind, he had transformed some cultural folktale into a horrific reality. 

I could not stop when the end was right there; I could not let the fear take me over. My suffering would finally cease. Whether that be from the icy storm that screamed outside, or the alleged monster that waited for me. I would be home, or I would be dead.

But I would be free.

It hit me. 

It hit me like a bullet to the brain. The sun, the wind, the smells, the world, it all hit me. 

But there were no birds. There were no wolves. There were no foxes, no bears, no reindeer, no cattle. There was nothing but the wind rattling the branches as scant trees smacked together furiously. I was the only thing in the forest. It was just me.

Snow flurried around my body and stuck to my clothes. The water in my eyes nearly froze, forcing me to blink away the ice. I knew that I didn’t have enough layers for the weather, but the cold didn’t bother me. My joints didn’t ache, and my muscles felt relieved from the dropping temperature. I felt irrevocably at peace in the icy wasteland.

I took another step. Already, my feet ached, but I didn’t care. How could I? How could I think of anything but beautiful Kate and lovely Rosie? How could I not cherish the world that somehow still existed outside those walls? 

My scarf flapped with the wind, forcing me to hold it close to my face. I felt the skin under my eyes frost over. The thick layer of snow barely crunched under my feet. If I took a light enough step, I could skirt right over the surface. It was far too cold for a beautiful powdery snowfall. No, it was but a thick ice that could cut right through your skin. Icicles would rain from the sky and encompass the land. I kept my head low and my steps consistent. 

Why had I felt the urge to release myself of my clothes? Why did I feel the need to drop into the tundra and succumb to the boreal?

I lifted my head, hoping I’d made some good progress, expecting to see a field of white. I stopped. Frozen, the lifeless body of a wolf stared at me. A thick layer of ice encapsulated it entirely. Its yellow teeth peeked out from under its lips, almost forming a snarl. Impossibly so, it was upright, as if still alive. I pulled the coat close to me and backed away.  

Its eyes followed my steps, judging my insecure steps. A crimson trail followed the creature and bloomed around its paws. It had been injured. I swallowed the spit accumulating in my mouth and shivered. 

I looked down at my hand and peeled the glove away from my skin. My wrist was already a pale, sickly shade of white.

“Fuck.” I said to myself.

Ahead of me, there was nothing but ice and snow. I looked behind me, and I realized I had barely left the old man’s front yard. The cabin beckoned me, and I knew I had no choice but to turn around. There was no way I would make it to the village and not succumb to the freezing temperatures.

I would have to start walking back to the cabin and lower my head in shame. As I took a few steps forward, cracks emitted throughout the plain, forcing me to stop. Sounds of trees falling and being ripped from the frozen ground erupted in the air.  Cracks and crashes coaxed me to turn around. I looked behind me. The trees stood no more and decorated the snow, fallen from unknown causes. One tree survived, strong and unwavering. I kept walking to the cabin, my pace speeding up.

Behind me, the impossibly large fir tree beckoned my attention. There was no chance that something like that could grow successfully in such horrifying conditions. I could not be distracted. The cabin was close. 

The thought of going back inside, in overwhelming heat, made my stomach turn. Bile tickled the back of my tongue. I wanted to stay out there, I wanted to drop to my knees and lick the snow from the ground. 

But that tree, something about that tree scared me more than the thought of being stuck in the blazing cabin with Viktor. Snow crunched behind me. I was being paranoid. There was nothing out there; nothing could survive out there. Nothing… natural…

The door was right in front of me. I was one door away from being back inside. But, I couldn’t. I had to turn around, just to see. 

What awaited me… was that tree. That two-story-tall tree sat there and stared at me. Its pitch black branches were decorated with white frozen needles. Whenever the wind rushed across the snow, it shook as if it were cold itself. I reached my hand out for the knob, but kept my eyes on that tree. A gale nearly blew me over as I held the door for stability. 

Maybe there was something behind it? 

A sharp cry echoed throughout the frozen prairie. Animalistic, like the guttural cry of a pained elk. The call pierced my ears. Goosepimples glazed over the tops of my arms and made my blood run cold.

It cried out again in an almost triumphant roar. That’s when I opened the door and slammed it behind me. The creature cried out once more and was far closer than before. Its bugle rattled the windows, nearly breaking them with a piercing frequency. 

I ripped off my gloves and threw them onto the couch. I grabbed the salt from the counter and nearly dumped its entire contents in front of the door and window. My tears were able to thaw and gradually decorated my cheeks. The eerie yowls continued, ending with low grunts. I ripped off my coat, along with the old man's, and sat in front of the fire.

“Please, God. Please.” I whispered, my hands clasped together in front of me. He hadn’t saved me in all my weeks out there, so why would he then? I lowered my head and let out a choked cry. My praying hands lacked any color, but caused me no pain. They shook from the cold and fear. The fire boiled my blood and made my skin sear in pain. But I sat there, anyway, retinas burned by roaring flames. I knew no hymns, no prayers, no words of protection. I knew no religion, no stories of the Bible, no patron saints to pray to. Maybe God didn't come because I didn’t know how to call? 

Over time, the cries slowly faded away. It left a tinnitus in my ear that was impossible to ignore. I didn’t dare pull myself away from the fire out of fear.  Minutes would pass, and the old man would not join me. He was still asleep, clueless to what had ensued.

 I eventually ripped off my crushing boots and let my aching feet stretch out. A shaky sigh left my lips as I wiped my damp cheeks. The heat made me feel sick again, but I needed to burn away every feeling of fear I had. I needed to forget the world outside and remember that this was my life. *This* was my world. 

The fire cracked and spat embers at me as my body drooped more and more. My breathing slowed, and my anxieties dissipated. I was drained of all energy. Too exhausted to worry or cry, I fell to my side. My body contorted into a fetal position on the floor as I tucked my arm under my head. The heat made my body swelter, but I didn’t care. I was asleep, inside thick walls made of old lumber. I was safe from whatever protected its territory outside.  Nothing could reach me, behind a door, behind thick piles of salt.“
