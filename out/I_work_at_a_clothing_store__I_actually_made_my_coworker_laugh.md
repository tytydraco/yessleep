After [last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/), I was nervous to show up for work today, to say the least. I knew Corporate would be there today, and I considered calling out, but I decided against it. I was scheduled with Samuel, and I needed to see if I could get some answers out of him. So you can imagine my surprise when I showed up to find Corey talking to Daniel in the office. They both turned and smiled at me when I walked in, and I had to force myself to look away from Corey to clock in.

&#x200B;

“Good morning, Harper! Are you feeling better today?” Daniel asked, and I noticed he was sweating. Clearly, Corey’s present was making everyone a bit on edge.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I’m fine. I thought you were off today?” I asked, trying to avoid Corey’s stare.

&#x200B;

"Oh yeah, I’m not staying long, I just wanted to go over our numbers with Corey here.”

&#x200B;

“You’ve been doing quite well, Harper,” she said, and I could’ve sworn she was taunting me somehow. “For someone rather new, you show real potential.”

&#x200B;

“Thanks. I should get out there,” I mumbled, quickly running to the floor, where I nearly ran into Sam.

&#x200B;

“Good morning,” I said, looking up at him. He was visibly unsettled, and walked past me like he didn’t even know I was there. “Alright then…”

&#x200B;

I started sweeping the floor, but I heard Corey’s loud laughter from the back. I was feeling nosey, so I decided to eavesdrop (don’t judge, I was tasked with learning more information, alright?). I stood in the fitting room closest to the curtain and listened.

&#x200B;

“I don’t get what the big deal is, Sam, I just asked. You don’t have to say yes,” Corey said, clearly sounding amused.

&#x200B;

“You’re not dragging me back down there. I’m doing great work here, and you know it. I mind my own business, keep my numbers up, and don’t make a mess,” Sam shouted, loud enough for me to hear it without straining.

&#x200B;

“Sam, relax, you don’t need to yell. She’s not transferring you, right Corey?”

&#x200B;

There was a tense pause after Daniel’s question, and I found myself holding my breath.

&#x200B;

“Not now. The warehouse is fully staffed at the moment, but I have a feeling we might be losing some employees soon. I’ll let you know if anything changes,” she replied threateningly.

&#x200B;

I heard footsteps approaching and quickly grabbed the broom and pretended to be sweeping. Sam walked out, not even noticing me, and began reorganizing the floor. Corey walked out shortly after him, smirking, and stood by the desk watching him. I snuck my way to the back without them noticing and caught Daniel packing up his things.

&#x200B;

“Heading out?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I gotta catch the bus,” he replied, clearly in a rush. I don’t know why, but I suddenly had a thought.

&#x200B;

“Hey, do you know Eleanora?” I held my breath, half expecting him to call Corey in and drag me away to some secret lair where I’d be tortured until I told them what happened last night.

&#x200B;

“Who?” he asked, not even looking up. “Is that a client? What does she want?”

&#x200B;

I paused, half shocked and half convinced he was lying.

&#x200B;

“So you don’t know anyone named Eleanora?” I asked again, trying to get his attention.

&#x200B;

He finally looked at me, and I could tell he was sincere, and also irritated. “No, Harper, sorry but I don’t have time for riddles. Was there an issue with something she purchased? Nevermind, just talk to me about it tomorrow. I’ll see you later.” And with that, he rushed out.

&#x200B;

I stood for a second, processing this very brief but informative interaction. Daniel had no idea who Eleanora was, or simply didn’t know our building had a name. There is a chance he was lying, but I’ve seen him lie before, and honestly, he’s pretty bad at it. I didn’t have too much time to ponder this discovery, because Corey came bouncing in.

&#x200B;

“Ready to work?”

&#x200B;

I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes, and I gave her my best fake smile and followed her out.

&#x200B;

We were actually rather busy, and I didn’t get an opportunity to pull Sam aside until we were closed and prepping for our custom. Corey walked out from the office, bag in hand.

&#x200B;

“Alright guys, great work today. I’m heading out, but I’ll see you tomorrow, Harper!”

&#x200B;

“Wait, you’re coming back?” I felt how sharp this came out, and judging by the way her face began melting into a scowl, she felt it too. “I mean, you’re going to be here tomorrow? Is everything alright?”

&#x200B;

It seemed she believed my feigned concern, as her face quickly returned.

&#x200B;

“Oh yes, everything is fine, I’m just having so much fun working with you guys! It can get so boring in my stuffy office, it’s great to work with real people again! See you tomorrow!” She basically skipped out the front door and down the stairs, and her peppiness made me nauseous.

&#x200B;

“God, could she be any more fucking obnoxious?” I asked, mostly to myself, but Sam heard and snorted a little laugh. I snapped my head towards him, and he quickly composed himself.

&#x200B;

You need to understand how crazy this was. I’ve known this person for a whole year, and I’ve never once seen him smile, let alone laugh, if he wasn’t trying to charm a client. The fact that I actually made him laugh was progress if I’ve ever seen it, and I decided to take advantage of this opening.

&#x200B;

“We have an hour before our custom, so I’m gonna have some tea. Want some?”

&#x200B;

We sat on the couch talking shit about Corey for an entire hour, and it was genuinely a good time. Sam is much less intimidating when he is smiling, and he seemed to appreciate my talent for pointing out the slightest fault in our boss.

&#x200B;

“How can you not know the difference between chinos and fucking trousers? You are the head boss for a fucking clothing store, lady!” I said between laughs, and Sam cracked up.

&#x200B;

“I honestly don’t understand how she got this job in the first place. Well, I *know* how she got this job, but still. They should have looked into what she knows before what she can do.”

&#x200B;

“What do you mean?” I asked, trying to be nonchalant and sipped my tea. He suddenly got serious, and I could see him considering something.

&#x200B;

“I know you’ve felt it. You have this sixth sense thing going on, so I know you’re not stupid. You can feel it when you look in her eyes, can’t you?”

&#x200B;

I nodded my head solemnly, and this confirmed my suspicions. She had some way of influencing people's thoughts and actions, either from eye contact or touch.

&#x200B;

“Her tricks don’t work on the owner, of course, but she could sense Corey’s power from a mile away. That’s why she hired her. Corey can make any employee do anything she wants with the slightest touch.”

&#x200B;

“Wait, we have an owner?” This information was completely new to me. I mean, of course I assumed someone owned us, but I figured it was some corporation and we were a simple speck in their line of various businesses.

&#x200B;

“Wow, you don’t know a lot about this place, do you?” he laughed, and got up to clean his mug.

&#x200B;

I quickly followed, desperate to learn more. “No, I really don’t, but I’d love to know anything you can tell me.”

&#x200B;

He eyed me suspiciously. “Why?”

&#x200B;

“This is my job! I’m here everyday, and I’d like to know what kind of company I’m representing,” I said, trying to sound genuine, but failing.

&#x200B;

He rolled his eyes. “It’s better if you just do your job and cash your checks. You don’t need anything else to be a good worker.”

&#x200B;

He quickly moved past me, but I wasn’t done.

&#x200B;

“What about Eleanora?”

&#x200B;

He froze in his tracks, and slowly turned his head towards me. “What did you just say?”

&#x200B;

“So you know.”

&#x200B;

He marched right up to my face and bent so we were eye to eye. “What. Did. You. Just. Say.”

&#x200B;

“Eleanora,” I whispered, feeling fear tightening my throat.

&#x200B;

He rose back up, and examined me carefully. “How do you know her name?”

&#x200B;

I swallowed hard, not sure if I could trust him. “I don’t know, I just do.”

&#x200B;

“You shouldn’t be talking about her. It’s dangerous, especially with Corey around. Don’t bring this up again. I don’t want to be dragged into your shit.”

&#x200B;

With that, the door opened and our custom client for the evening, Jacque, sauntered in.

&#x200B;

I know you guys like to hear about my custom clients, and Jacque is one of the newer shoppers with us. He is technically my client, since I helped him the first time he came in a few months ago, so he has a preference for me. Most of the other clients I work with have been helped by either Sam or Daniel for years before I was around, so I just fill in on their days off. Jacque is one of my favorite clients to help because not only is he much less picky when it comes to colors and fabrics, but because he seems to be one of the more harmless clients I deal with. Jacque, of course, is a Mime. I know, it feels like a stereotype, but this guy is made for the Mime life. I know it’s because he is some sort of supernatural being, but it is still incredible to watch him do his thing. Watching him walk up an imaginary wall to get a feel for the mobility of the pants he wants to buy? For no reason other than to entertain me? That’s a real man. Seeing him in his face paint, checking his fake watch instantly brought me out of the panic attack I was about to succumb to.

&#x200B;

“Jacque!” I said excitedly, and he over-acted being surprised and delighted to see me. He gave me double cheek kisses, then tapped his fake watch, acting annoyed.

&#x200B;

“I know, I know, I’m sorry. We were finishing up some stock stuff in the back. But we’re here now!”

&#x200B;

He glanced behind me, and I watched as Sam briskly walked out the door and left. Jacque and I looked at each other, and I put on my best *it’s fine* smile.

&#x200B;

“Looks like it’s just you and me tonight, sir!”

&#x200B;

He waved off my formality and pretended to put on a fancy coat, top hat, and walked around with an invisible cane.

&#x200B;

I laughed lightly. “I see, time for a new suit?”

&#x200B;

As I was ringing him up, he looked around dramatically and slipped me a $20 bill.

&#x200B;

“Oh, Jacque, I can’t-”

&#x200B;

He held up his hand, zipped his mouth shut and locked it, lovingly placing the pretend key in my hand. He gave me a warm smile before a giant gust of wind seemed to come out of nowhere and blow him out the door, giving me no time to refuse. I smiled at the bill in my hand, dotted with black and white paint, when I noticed tiny writing on the back of it.

&#x200B;

*She needs your help.*
