When my grandmother passed away, I was the only one willing to take her house. The rest of the family called it “too far,” “too dark,” “too sad.”

I called it quiet.

It’s a small cottage at the edge of a forest, half-swallowed by ivy and shadow. The inside still smells like tea and mothballs. Her furniture is all intact — like she never left, just stepped out for a walk she never came back from.

At the end of the narrow hallway, there’s a grandfather-style pendulum clock. Beautiful craftsmanship — oak wood, brass hands, and a cracked glass door.

It stopped ticking sometime in the late ‘90s. My grandmother always said it stopped the same night she had her first stroke. She never wanted it fixed.

Neither did I.

Until three nights ago.

I woke at exactly 3:11 a.m. to a sound I couldn’t place at first. A soft click… clack… click… clack. Not from inside my room. From the hallway.

It was the clock.

Ticking. Loud and steady.

That would’ve been odd enough — but the strange part? The weights were still frozen. The pendulum didn’t move. It wasn’t supposed to work.

I walked down the hall in the dark and stood in front of it.

The hands pointed to 3:11.

The second I looked, the minute hand twitched forward. The pendulum — unmoving — but the ticking kept going.

In the morning, I told my aunt. Her face went white.

She told me something she never shared at the funeral: My grandmother believed the clock was cursed. She said it was given to her by a man who "never aged," who left it on her porch wrapped in black cloth.

“He told her,” my aunt whispered, “that the clock doesn’t just measure time. It keeps something in.”

“What do you mean, ‘in’?”

She wouldn’t answer. Just begged me not to sleep there again.

I didn’t listen.

Last night, I stayed up, all the lights off, staring at the clock from the living room.

At exactly 3:11 a.m., the ticking started again.

This time, louder.

And then the clock struck once.

It’s never chimed before. It’s not built to chime — I opened it weeks ago, curious. No bell. No chime mechanism.

The lights flickered. In the reflection of the hallway mirror, I saw something — just a glimpse — standing behind me.

Tall. Thin. Its arms touched the floor. Its head was tilted sideways… too far.

I turned.

Nothing there.

I didn’t sleep. I just sat by the door, waiting for the sun.

This morning, the front door was unlocked. I always lock it.

There were muddy footprints in the hallway — one set. Bare feet. They led from the front door… to the clock.

And stopped.

But there were no footprints going out.

Now it’s night again.

And the clock is ticking again — but now it hasn’t stopped.

Every minute, the hands move.

Every hour, it chimes once more than the last.

Right now it’s 10:00 p.m., and it just struck ten.

Whatever’s inside… I don’t think it’s trapped anymore.
