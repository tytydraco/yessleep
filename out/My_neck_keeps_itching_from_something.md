It started after my mother was diagnosed, a little shiver in my neck, a coldness that seemed to strike unpredictably and that I just couldn’t get rid of. Harmless, I thought—many times I’d felt a kind of tremor in my skin before. Like most people, I shrugged it off while preparing my schoolbag. At school, while I was having lunch, it happened again, this time with an itch.

Suddenly, my friend Tyler smacked the table beside me—a move he did so often it had become tradition. So often, in fact, that I’d grown somewhat immune to it. He’d smash or tap whatever surface to announce his presence, a quirk I’d adapted to. But this time, I got startled.

“Hahaha! Got you this time, Ben! You’ve been tense lately or what?” he said, sitting down next to me with his plate.

“Jeez, Tyler! What the fuck!?” I retorted, scratching my neck. I wasn’t usually this nervous, and when I was, I’d usually bite my finger or cover my mouth. But this time, I just felt the itch.

Tyler raised his arms in surrender. “Calm down, buddy, just playing with ya. How’d the weekend treat you?”

“Urgh... it’s been alright... nothing too out of the ordinary,” I said, finally managing to control my subconscious and stop scratching my neck, which had started to hurt.

Tyler leaned back in his seat, sighing heavily. “Bro... your weekends are always such a bore... what’s up with Clara?”

“She’s still out of town... you’re not hitting on my sister anytime soon, buddy. Just keep dreaming."

“Oh, come on, you know I’m just saying...”

“Yeah, sure. You’re hanging onto the fact that she’d like both a kid two years younger than her and someone who has to make noise to remind people he exists.”

I figured that came off as rude. Tyler didn’t seem too offended. I had to guess it was because there was no real way to offend him if he was planning on pursuing my sister. Then again, maybe he was just unaffected. He shrugged.

As we ate, I heard it—a chirping, like when a cicada is touched, coming from my neck. It lasted half a second, but the feeling seemed to stretch beyond that moment.

“What was that?” I asked Tyler.

He looked at me, spoon halfway to his mouth, confused. “What was what?”

He turned around, probably thinking I was referring to something around us when I didn’t answer right away. I stayed silent, expecting the same sound to come back on cue, but it never did.

“Jeez, Ben... you playing a prank? I said I’m sorry.”

“No... it’s just... never mind. I thought I heard something.”

Tyler raised his brow but shrugged and kept eating. Still, I found myself scratching my neck again, feeling it burn slightly under my fingertips as the bell rang.

I woke up to a tap on my shoulder. Mrs. Tania tugged at my arm, looking disappointed. “Ben... how much did you sleep last night?”

I looked around. The class had long ended. The blackboard was filled with equations I couldn’t yet understand.

“S-Sorry, Mrs. Tania... I forgot to take my meds...” That was a lie. I often pulled all-nighters playing online with friends. Kyle usually stayed up with me, but his insomnia seemed less of a problem. He still performed decently in class, while I was bound to sleep through at least one lesson. I felt disappointed every time he left to sleep and I couldn’t find any drowsiness in myself. But I always felt it when I got to school, especially in classes where I slacked off.

“You have to remind your father more often... he may forget. And these are your meds. Why don’t you leave them on your desk or somewhere you have to pass through every day?” Mrs. Tania was nothing short of a sweetheart. She was probably the person who handled my insomnia the best. She was the only one I felt guilty lying to.

As I thought of an excuse to make my way out, I heard it—the sound of an insect, a chirping, at my neck. Once again, it itched. I started scratching fast, fast enough for the teacher to notice.

“Is something wrong, Ben?” she asked in her lukewarm voice.

I didn’t have an explanation. This itch felt off, not normal, not supposed to happen. So why?

“I think my house might be infested... it feels like something stung me here.”

Mrs. Tania looked over my neck, not quite sure where to look. I pointed to the source of the itch, but the more she squinted, the more it seemed like I was going crazy.

“You really need more sleep, Ben...” she sighed. “I’m letting you go this time, but next time I’ll have to send you to detention. I can’t keep hiding you in the classroom forever, and I don’t want you to sleep through your lessons. I can’t help you with exams if you don’t show up.”

I nodded, excused myself, grabbed my backpack, and ran off. Thankfully, there was a protest outside, so we were let out early to avoid danger.

The itch continued throughout the day—chitin clashing with something, like crushing a bug between your fingers—and it was all in the same spot on my neck, which I swore had swollen a little. As soon as I got home, I rushed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I couldn’t see any kink or turn in my skin. To the naked eye, I was fine, but I couldn’t stay at peace.

The next day was uneventful. Somehow I stayed awake through the entire school day. Mrs. Tania gave me a proud smile during class. She probably thought her advice had finally stuck. Still, the itch lingered. I felt like something other than me was scratching that spot. The chirping became more metallic, and I started wondering if I was going insane.

Walking through the hallways, a girl suddenly pointed at my face. “You have something on your face,” she said, passing by with her friends. I was sure it was on my neck. I rushed to the bathroom, wondering what I’d find. I expected a horrible infected wound, but it was just a piece of food stuck to my neck. I don’t know why, but it felt glued on. It took some effort to pull off, and I swear I saw a black splinter retreat back into my skin. There just couldn’t be any way.

The rest of the day, I wondered if I should just cut my neck to see what the hell was under it, what was itching like a parasite I couldn’t get out of my body. When the bell finally rang, Mr. Peterson looked at me worriedly. I was scratching my neck like crazy.

“Is something the matter, Mr. Wallace?” he said, sauntering over.

I kept scratching, my voice trembling. “T-There’s something... I-”

“I trust you’re not making an excuse to get a better grade? I’m not feeling merciful, and you didn’t do well on your exam,” he interrupted.

“But—” I started.

He *kept* interrupting. “I’d advise you to keep studying instead of... unwinding in my after class.”

He crossed his arms, fixing me with a disapproving, tired look.

I wanted to scream at him. At that moment, I wished whatever was happening to me would somehow transfer to him. Still, I gritted my teeth, grabbed my bag, and stomped out.

Kyle didn’t come the next school day. Just what I fucking needed, the one day he decided not to show up.

And for the first time, what I dreaded most appeared.

Pain.

It was the tiniest sting, but I knew it wouldn’t get better. Across the day, it grew more and more irritating, more and more painful, like a molten needle pushing through the skin of my neck. The day passed in a blur, most of it spent clenching anything I could reach. Tears welled in my eyes. I was so tired.

Walking home, I tried my best not to scratch. Not because the skin didn’t itch, but because teenagers my age have to look nonchalant. That’s all I did—try. Soon enough, I was back at it, scratching like a flea-ridden dog. I touched my neck and felt a bump the size of my thumb in the same spot I’d memorized.

I had to lean against a post or wall every now and then to catch my breath. My hand was tired from moving back and forth so much. The skin on my neck felt like a fresh wound. I could swear I felt wind passing through it, rustling chitinous scales inside.

Finally home, I yelled for my mom. She wasn’t around. I threw my bag against the wall and looked at the fridge, expecting what I found—a note saying she’d gone to chemo.

I clenched that note so hard my hand ached. Of course she’d gone. Of course it had to be today. Of course she couldn’t stay home and help me for once in her life as a failed mother.

I needed a knife. It was their fault. If they found me, I hoped they blamed themselves.

I found one, ran to the bathroom, and slammed the door closed. I was going to find out what the hell was inside my skin, what had been bothering me so much.

I aimed the knife at my neck, but I didn’t really want to. Why did this itch start happening to me? What the fuck was wrong with my body?

I pressed the knife closer, then paused. There was a white spot, the width of a stinger. It was moving—I knew it was. A tail started coming out of my pore. For something so small, I could clearly see the tapering along its surface.

It was a fucking worm.

I screamed. Soon, my entire face filled with white spots and pustules, from which all kinds of tails emerged. My entire face—no, body—was infested. The bump on my neck had grown to the size of a clenched fist. As the tiny dance of maggots in my skin made me want to vomit, I plunged the knife into the bump.

  


I woke to the smell of chloroform and buzzing lights. The place was familiar—I’d been here before. It was a room in St. Luke’s hospital. But this time, I wasn’t visiting my mom.

My neck was bandaged. My stomach churned at the sight of myself. I knew the worms were still inside me. I needed to be opened up, but I didn’t want to stay like this.

The door opened. A doctor stepped in.

“Greetings, Ben. How are you feeling?”

I didn’t feel like I could answer. I knew the moment I tried, a thousand insects would fly and crawl out of my mouth, finally free from their flesh crib.

“Well... I guess your neck still hurts. Luckily, you bruised it more than you cut it. The knife lightly sliced the side, so of course there was bleeding. But it’s good to hear you came to your senses before you did worse.”

I didn’t feel “at my senses” at all.

Then I remembered the bump, but when my hand reached my neck, it was back to its usual shape. The bump was gone. And more than that—the itch was gone.

Soon, my mom was allowed in, who came alongside my sister. my mother explained to me that a neighbor had found me thanks to the yelling. The doctors didn't want to talk about what they thought was a suicide attempt, and to be honest, it pretty much was, but my mom talked about it, loudly. I could tell she was more worried than angry.

Over the following days, thanks to the sterile environment, I was able to calm down enough to speak. I told the whole story. The doctors nodded and took notes. They talked about something called delusional parasitosis, or Ekbom’s syndrome.

That was the best they could do? Saying I was fucking crazy? that everything I went through was just my imagination playing tricks on me?

I wanted to believe it, but what if it was real? they needed to check me, they needed to see just what was wrong with me.

As days passed, the doctors grew certain of my recovery. I no longer coughed or scratched my neck. Hell, I slept perfectly at night. But I didn’t want to leave the hospital. The white tiled walls and floors gave me a sense of security I didn’t know I needed before.

Soon, I had to go home.

When I got there, I felt every germ and particle in the house. I wondered how much harm it was doing to my body. I felt like a slab of meat in a grassland full of wolves.

As I settled on the bed, I felt dirty. My whole body felt occupied by so many things I used to ignore. Now, I couldn’t. At any moment, invisible monsters could crawl through my back while I was at my most vulnerable.

I cursed my body for not being see through, for having to guess what was behind every crack and crevice of my skin, for being left to fend for my body the only pathetic way we know how, like taking a cup of water out of the sea to empty it, it was useless, but nothing could stop that last rebellion.

Because i knew, I was scratching at my neck.

And that I had an itch.
