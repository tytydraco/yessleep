Many people say all it takes is one bad day to drive someone crazy, and yea I guess that can be true but in my experience that one day has been coming for a long time.

From the day I was born I’ve been many things; a mistake, useless, you know the typical asshole parent/bully things, not trying to get into all that though, basically what I’m saying is this was a long time coming.

It started off like any other I woke up got ready for my 12 hour shift at the local hospital, swept my long brown hair back and walked out the door.

The drive wasn’t too long about 15 minutes from my house and probably about 10 minutes into it I get pulled over, not wanting to get into something at work I sent my boss a message and waited to be approached by the skinnier looking cop standing by his door, when something charges into the cop car sending it flying into a wall pinning the cop between the two, now I’m just a cook but I know enough to know that the cop was probably not waking up, stumbling I shift my car into gear I speed off not knowing what completely happened but knowing whatever it was, would probably come for me next.

As I look into my rear view mirror I see something that can’t be from this world, a huge creature probably the size of a rhino but with long stringy red fur, which I don’t know if it is the actually color or stained with blood, a mouth almost to big for its body and small dot like eyes.

Not wanted to get a closer look I slam my foot back into the gas hoping this old blazer could out run this beast, racing down the road I see the thing keeping up with me slinging other cars and light poles like they’re nothing when I see a ramp onto the highway, going as fast as this old truck will take me which doesn’t seem fast enough I drive up it hoping the creature will give up the chase, when I turn to see how close it was I get slammed from the left side sending me and the already beat up truck off the highway and onto the lower streets.

I don’t know how long I was out, my guess is around 2 mins because when I came to the beast was only just stepping up to the car, when “smack” a bulldozer runs into the side of the beast impaling it between the wall and the blade of the dozer, when my eyes starting to fade back to black.

I woke up 7 hours later in a weird looking hospital when 4 fractured ribs, a broken leg, and a concussion, amongst a few other things, after the nurse and doctors questions about my pain level and stuff a man in similar height to me steps into the room wearing an expensive but almost casual looking suit, short hair, and no facial hair. 

“Mr. Beck” he said stepping closer to me, “I just wanted to offer my condolences for what happened to you today, you see sometimes unexplainable things happ-“ 

When I cut him off saying “unexplainable?” “Whats so unexplainable about a creature looking like it came straight from hell running me off the road”

The man’s face seemed to tense when I said that almost like it caught him off guard, “so, you could see it?” He said giving me a puzzled look

“How could one miss it?” I said giving a sour and even more confused look.

 The man leaned down next to me offering his hand, shaking it I ask him “what was it?”
He sighed and said “well that’s harder to explain then just telling you a tornado or something hit you, but it’s something you weren’t supposed to see, hell you may be the only person to have ever truly seen something like it.

He paused I guess giving me time to speak but his small answer only have more questions, continuing he said “I’m well we can get into that later but this creature was from my world and sometimes beings like him can slip through the cracks and cause chaos which usually gets chopped up to terrorism, we’ll because your kind usually can’t see them and when they do usually it’s like looking at a ball of gas or something yalls eyes just can perceive it, but you?, I’ve never met someone who’s actually been able to see it”.

Seeing I had more questions now then answers he said “you can call me B short for Beezle” which I would later learn was some kind of hint or clue on his part but I’m getting ahead of myself, “To answer you’re questions we’ll the ones I can, yes I’m not human we’ll I am and aren’t hard to explain, what you see is more of an illusion or outfit I guess you could say, and the important thing is I’m here to make sure these things don’t happen” which I got the sense he meant more then demon like creatures.

“So, umm why are you telling me this?” 

“We’ll under normal circumstances I wouldn’t, it’s not exactly permitted, rules and stuff but I’ve never had to deal with someone actually seeing a creature so now I’m left with 2 options, wipe your memory which yes it is painful but you wouldn’t remember, or (reaching his hand out again) you can come with me, I could use a sidekick” B says with a strange laugh.

Without a second thought I shook his hand, “what do I got to loose”.
