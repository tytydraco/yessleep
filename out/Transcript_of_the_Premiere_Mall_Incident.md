In 1982, something happened at the Premiere Mall in \[REDACTED\], Washington. A series of unexplainable events occurred over the course of a week at the mall. Survivors of the incident were interviewed by the \[REDACTED\] county sheriff’s department after it was possible to rescue the civilians.

Unfortunately, many of the civilians who were in the mall at the time are still missing to this day. No one has been able to find any trace of over 300 individuals who were inside the mall during this period. Over 50 of the employees for the stores and restaurants inside are still missing.

These are the transcripts of the interviews with some of the rescued people from what is now known as the Premiere Mall Incident. These transcripts have finally been declassified and released to the public. Warning: some of the information in these transcripts may be considered disturbing to those who read it. You have been warned.

Transcript of the interview between Officer Jonathan Carter and Maria Gonzalez. Maria Gonzalez, age 35, was the assistant manager at a shoe store inside the Premiere Mall. She was on her lunch break in the food court when the incident happened.

**Officer Carter:** So, Mrs. Gonzalez. Can you tell me what happened?

**Gonzalez:** (silence)

**Officer Carter:** It’s okay if you’re not ready to talk about it yet. I understand what happened was terrible. If you want, you can come back later when you’re ready.

**Gonzalez:** I . . . was just having lunch. I . . . I . . was eating my salad in the food court . . . and then (whimpering).

**Officer Carter:** Hey, it's okay. You’re safe. Everything is okay. Do you want me to get you anything?

**Gonzalez:** (shakes her head no)(continues whimpering) The food court . . . it changed. Tables flew into the ceiling or sunk into the floor . . . . people began screaming. The . . . ovens in the . . . restaurants . . . they breathe fire. I saw my friend in the Chinese place . . . he . . . (sobbing) OH MY GOD . . . HE WAS EATEN BY THE WALLS! THE WALLS . . . THEY SWALLOWED HIM UP! BLOOD WAS EVERYWHERE! (wailing)(crying)(sobbing)

Maria Gonzalez became inconsolable at this point in time and was unable to provide more information to the incident. Officer Jonathan Carter stopped the interview and had an officer take Maria Gonzalez back home to her family.

Transcript of the interview between Officer Harold Myers Bergs and Ethan Holden. Ethan Holden, age 16, was in a video game store with his friends, Nathan Dunn, Kyle Lambert, and Steven Hilton at the time of the incident. Nathan Dunn, age 15, Kyle Lambert, age 17, and Steven Hilton, age 16, are still missing.

**Officer Bergs:** Alright, Ethan. Can you tell me what happened? Just start at the beginning, what was going on before the incident?

**Holden:** It was all pretty normal. My friends and I were looking for some new Atari games. I have a system at home and we saved up enough to get a new game.

**Officer Bergs:** Was anything out of the ordinary before the incident? Even something small?

**Holden:** No. Not that I can think of. It just . . . happened. Stuff went all weird.

**Officer Bergs:** Weird how?

**Holden:** They had some demo games that you could play before buying them. The screens went all static-y. Then the characters . . . they jumped out of the screen and started moving around the store. One of them grabbed Kyle and . . .  I tried to hold onto him . . . we all did. It was too strong and then he was gone.

**Officer Bergs:** Gone? Where? Where did Kyle go?

**Holden:** I DON’T FUCKING KNOW, MAN! IF I KNEW, I WOULD TELL YOU! KYLE WAS LIKE AN OLDER BROTHER TO ME!

**Officer Bergs:** Whoa, calm down, young man. I’m just trying to help. Take a few deep breaths.

(pause)

**Officer Bergs:** Are you ready to continue?

**Holden:** (sniffles) Yeah . . .

**Officer Bergs:** What happened next?

**Holden:** The store . . . the games started flying all over the place . . . stuff started to melt like ice cream left out in the sun . . . the ground began to shake. The guy at the register was freaking out and was trying to get away from something . . . I didn’t see it because he was looking down at something behind the counter. Whatever it was grabbed him and he was trying to get away. He was dragged behind the counter into the back of the store. All I heard was this scream . . . like something out of a horror movie . . then there was a fountain of blood that splattered out. We started running out of the store. I don’t remember what happened after I got out of the store. I woke up outside the mall in an ambulance. That was the last time I saw my friends.

Any trace of Nathan Dunn, Kyle Lambert, and Steven Hilton has never been found. The body of Joseph Burns, age 14, the cashier at the video game store, was found mutilated in the back room of the store. The wounds on Joseph Burns body were so severe that he could only be identified by his dental records.

Transcript between Officer Ella Matthews and Carly Edwards. Carly Edwards, age 74, was in the toy store with her grandchildren, Ivan Edwards and Thea Edwards, when the incident occurred. She and her grandchildren were injured but alive.

**Officer Matthews:** Mrs. Edwards, can you tell me how you and your grandchildren were injured?

**Edwards:** I was in the toy store with Ivan and Thea, we were picking out some toys for their new little sister. Then I heard something strange . . . like stones grinding against each other mixed with a tree snapping in half. The floor began to . . . liquify is the best word I can describe what happened.

**Officer Matthews:** Liquify? Like you were sinking into the floor or what?

**Edwards:** No. It was more like the floor had become . . . ocean waves but still the floor. It was solid but also moving in waves at the same time. That’s the best way I can describe it, but that doesn’t feel right.

**Officer Matthews:** Ok? Continue. What happened after that?

**Edwards:** I heard screams, most people were panicked and confused. I saw the shelves collapse in on themselves and fold up like origami into different shapes that didn’t seem possible. I grabbed Ivan and Thea’s hands and tried to get them out of the mall. We were only able to get out of the walkway overlooking the atrium when . . . I’m not really sure what happened or how to describe it.

**Officer Matthews:** It’s okay, just do your best.

**Edwards:** The ceiling opened up and it was just the atrium below us repeating on and on forever. Then I heard people screaming and felt myself start to feel lighter. Like when you’re on one of those carnival rides that drop really fast. I don’t know if it was instinct or what, but I grabbed Thea and Ivan and we wrapped ourselves around the railings. As soon as we did this, it was like gravity reversed and everything started to fall into the ceiling.

**Officer Matthews:** Oh my God.

**Edwards:** Everything in the atrium that wasn’t bolted down . . . gone. Even people. They all fell into the sky and I didn’t see what happened to them. (sniffs)(sobs) My God, those poor people. There was something in the ceiling, I think it was alive but I couldn’t tell you what it was. Those poor souls . . . they looked so scared. I still hear the screams in my ears. Next thing I know, I was thrown to the floor with Thea and Ivan under me. I could feel my ribs were broken. But that’s not the worst part.

**Officer Matthews:** What was the worst part?

**Edwards:** (crying) It began to rain blood.

Ivan Edwards, age 4, and Thea Edwards, age 8, were in the hospital during this time. Carly Edwards had landed on the two children, breaking several bones. After this, Ivan Edwards who was described as a chatterbox full of energy had become mute. There is no physical cause for this, it appears to be psychological. Thea Edwards refuses to talk about the incident to anyone, even to this day.

Nobody has been able to figure out what caused the incident or why. The area surrounding the mall’s former location has slowly been abandoned over the decades. Now there is nothing left but decaying buildings and creeping weeds. What happened to the Premiere Mall is still unknown. All that is left is a depression the same shape as the mall’s layout and cracked, overgrown parking lot.
