The internet is filled with stories about people who “clip” out of reality and into somewhere else. Terms like Back-Rooms/States/Woods are common on Reddit. And I’m not here to argue semantics with you. I call them Fairy Pockets, but even that is just a term I made up, so use what you like, there are no word police. Not that I have found yet


There are no set rules by which one enters a Fairy Pocket; sometimes you just slip in by accident, though there’s usually an easy way out, if you know what to look for. Something that will just not look right and help you pull yourself back to reality. It’s hard to explain.


My job is that I find them, go into them, and figure out what, if anything, is valuable there and then sell that information to governments or private businesses. You would be shocked at the amount of natural resources some of these places hold. I can assure you that the Iraq War was not about oil without a shadow of a doubt. But they’re always dangerous, so it’s a tough call on whether or not they’re worth it. And, thank God, not mine to make. Usually, you can find some idiots willing to buy your dangerous claim for at least enough to break even, unless it’s Rockport. Nobody even tries to claim that godforsaken place anymore. Today I’m just gonna tell you about a few places I found, and then, if there are any questions, I’ll try and answer them, so without further ado, let’s start with Pittsburgh’s Infinite City


There is this one place in downtown Pittsburgh about two blocks from the old US Steel building, where if you follow a complicated set of turns and steps. (Which I can’t disclose due to an NDA) You will find yourself in a near-endless, entirely abandoned cityscape of almost identical brick tenements. It, as far as I could tell, served no real practical use to the people I sold it to, but mine is not to reason why. They paid well, and I don’t question money on general principle. That said, the thing that struck me as most strange about this place wasn’t how empty it was or who built it, being a total mystery. (I always have assumed something built these places.) No, the strangest part of this was that every single sign or any other piece of writing I could find in this city was written in what I eventually identified as a fourteenth-century dialect of Polish.


That’s a nice and simple one, not really scary. Though I confess, all those empty buildings did get eerie, but most of the things I find are like that, a little off-putting perhaps, but not anything special. And this memoir is dedicated more to my horrific experiences, after all, they’re the ones that make for good stories. Now, some places like that feel creepy, but are fine. Others, like what we’ll talk about next, feel fine but are potentially dangerous. 


If you’ve ever taken a road trip through Kansas, you’ll know how flat it is, but perhaps one or two of you, while driving, have thought you saw a mountain way off in the distance. You probably stopped and shook your head, maybe rubbed your eyes, and it was gone. Good, it doesn’t exist, and it can’t hurt you. Unless you drive exactly four miles over the speed limit for twenty minutes while staring at the mountain. Then take a sharp left onto a dirt road between two cornfields with a wooden sign on an archway over it. The sign may or may not say anything, that tends to change for some reason. The dirt farm road will soon turn into a paved highway, and you will be in Hascombe County. It’s a nice place if you don’t mind the smell of sulfur; it’s a geothermal hotspot, and the entire place stinks of eggs. The locals are nice, hard-working folks who will give you the shirt off their back, and really are fine people. But take my advice and don’t go to any of the churches in the county. They all have the same preacher who tells the same sermon every week, like a recording. And the people can get violent if you ever look bored during it. Other than that, it’s a great place to live, with property values that can’t be beat, on account of the fact that I am fairly certain it’s still 1973 there. 


A few hundred miles away, there’s one place in the Midwest. Again, for legal reasons, I can’t tell exactly how to find. What I can tell is that it’s a small regional airport in a big-ish city, that’s all I can say. The vending machines all sell products that aren’t in business anymore, but I am not entirely sure if that’s supernatural or just some strange gimmick on the part of the airport management. What is weird is that if you walk into one specific woman's bathroom on a Tuesday, there will be an elevator at the far end of the room past the last sink. It takes you up through 99 floors, 98 of which are identical open-plan office space. You cannot see the skyscraper from outside the airport, and actually, some planes fly right through where it should be. Every floor is the same, laid out in long rows of desks with big box computers and off-white landline phones with woodgrain siding, each station manned by workers dressed in business casual, talking on phones and generally doing what you’d expect from a call center. The only issue is that they are speaking exclusively in dead languages, Latin, Proto-Finnic, Occitan, I even heard some Akkadian when I was there. 


Honestly, it’s the most well-managed office I’ve ever seen, everyone works hard, and nothing ever goes majorly wrong. Which I suspect has something to do with the fact that as far as I could tell there were no managers to screw things up. I went up to floor 99, but decided against floor 100. You see, 99 was a waiting room like you’d find at a doctor’s office, and to access floor 100, you had to take the stairs. The sounds coming from up there cannot be described, and I do mean cannot. I have tried repeatedly, and it only leads to my having a seizure. Not wanting to repeat that, I will leave them to your imagination. A buddy of mine who is a priest suggested that I had found purgatory, and perhaps he was right. I’m no theologian, so I’ll leave that one to the church. 


There is an area in San Francisco where you can see what I think is Atlantis, where Alcatraz should be, but I haven’t figured out how to get there yet. And there is a way to get to the moon from Houston without NASA being involved. But by far the weirdest Fairy Pocket I ever found was Mount Prince Nelson National Park in West Virginia. It’s a beautiful place by the way, wonderful hiking, and some absolutely stunning views of the mountains. But I don’t recommend you take your kids. It is by far the most dangerous place I have ever been, and I lived in Chicago for three months. Long story, I was trying to figure out where all the damned clowns kept coming from. But I digress, Mt Prince Nelson is about 700 square miles, located within an area of West Virginia no larger than a Wal-Mart parking lot, which coincidentally is how you get there. Follow the steps correctly, and where the main doors are, a stone arch will appear with an NPS Ranger who charges you 42 cents as an entry fee, and hands you a waiver to sign in the reasonably likely event that you die in the park. There are miles and miles of roads, both paved and unpaved, and a core area around a lake that contains the majority of the tourist stuff. It’s more or less safe on account of the National Park Service maintaining a round-the-clock watch on the perimeter that would make the Marines look sloppy. And the flight of F-14 Eagle fighter jets flying 24/7 hot laps around the area is a great comfort. But we weren’t paid to be comfortable, and our bosses wanted us deeper in the park, and off trail. Once you get outside of the patrolled area, like we were, things take a turn; everything, and I do mean everything, wants to kill you. 


There are beetles (insect) the size of beetles (car) for starters. The cool part, however, is the dinosaurs that roam free in the park. Side note, that whole “They can’t see you if you don’t move” thing is bull. Ask me how I know. It’s a rainforest, so the backwoods camping isn’t easy, because hacking your way off-trail is a nightmare even without the venomous trees and psychic frogs. But I have to say, it really is beautiful, puts Yellowstone to shame on a bad day, and that’s saying it mildly. 


When I first went to Mt Prince Nelson, I was part of a team of specialists called in by the National Park Service to figure out why they kept getting paperwork from their employees there despite no knowledge of it existing. We spent about six months figuring out how to get in, and that’s when things started to go badly wrong. Our team lead, an older guy named Donald, was the first to die. He had taken watch around our camp on the first night after we left the Safe Zone, and some kind of big ape-looking thing came out of the woods and attacked. Beat poor Donnie half to death before we were able to kill it, and he was dead by the time we got him back to a ranger station for medivac. We had a job to do, and the pay was good, so we pushed on, deeper into the woods. Where the 9 surviving men of our team got knocked down to 5 on the third day by some kind of screaming fog, though all things considered, it wasn’t so bad, as it also killed the T-Rex that was chasing us. Jakoby, one of the newbies, went nuts that night and started talking about how he had communed with a goddess at the center of the mountain in his sleep. And that he needed to go out and join her amidst the rocks lest all reality be consumed. I had to put him down with my 45 before the crazy spread to the rest of the team, which might be my least favorite part of this damned job. The remaining 4 of us found an old cabin nearby and decided to hold up for the night. By the next morning, we were down to 3. I hadn’t gotten to Jakoby in time, I guess. 


We reached the decision that we were going to try and make our way back to the Safe Zone after a short debate. I always try to be democratic where possible. So we started back, when we had been walking for around 7 hours, Rodriguez, who was on point, signaled a halt. He said he thought he had heard a twig breaking about 100 yards to our right. He was right, too worst luck; if he hadn’t stopped, maybe that prick wouldn’t have been able to line up his shot. The arrow took Rodriguez in the chest, sending him to the ground. Me and O’Leary opened up with our weapons in the direction of the archer, but I don’t think we hit him. Rodriguez would have survived had the arrow not been poisoned, but he was already turning green and bleeding from his eyes by the time I got the bandage over the wound. I gave him “last rites” by sticking a stake through his heart and zip-tying a cross to his right hand so he wouldn’t come back as anything unnatural. Then the two of us left and set off again in the direction of home. 


O’Leary and I made it a long way that day without stopping and ended up camping close enough to the Safe Zone that we were fairly confident in making it there the next day. I took first watch and chewed coffee grounds to stay awake, as I had no doubts that we were still being hunted. The attack came sometime around zero dark thirty when I got a feeling on the back of my neck that I was being watched. I have learned to listen to these feelings, and it’s why I’m still alive. Diving for the ground, the arrow just narrowly missed me, slamming into a tree a few yards behind. O’Leary was awake now and scrambling for his rifle while I fired blindly into the trees from cover. We were unlikely to make it back without getting rid of this hunter, so I signaled for him to cover me as I crawled away from our camp. It took about ten minutes or so before I found his tracks, two muddy bootprints and a Snickers wrapper gave away where he had been standing, and a trail of greenish-blue blood leading away from the spot told me one of us had hit the bastard.


O’Leary and I stalked him for about half a mile before we found him collapsed by a creek bed, panting heavily. A handsome young man dressed in bright orange hunting gear: the only sign he wasn’t human was the metallic red hair and his almost neon green eyes. He cussed me out in what might have been an early ancestor of Welsh, before O’Leary blew his brains all over the forest floor. I wasn’t sure that would stop him for long, so just to be safe, I hog-tied him before we left. 


O’Leary quit this job after we made it back to civilization. I can’t blame him. The last I heard, he had become a Buddhist monk and lived up some mountain in Colorado. I just hoped it wasn’t anywhere near Rockport, that is one pocket that even I won’t go to. But the pay from the National Park Service was more than enough for me to retire on, had I wanted to. So there are certainly perks to this job. Why do I still do it? I would love to get philosophical, but frankly, I just like it. It tickles the part of the human spirit that first pushed man to sail across oceans or fly to the moon. And like those great explorers of the past, I’m not sure if I could stop even if I wanted to, it has its hooks in me and won’t let go. 


I have other stories, of course. Might even post them later, but these were a few that stood out to me. I will try to answer any questions, but given the number of NDAs and Ancient Blood Oaths I’ve had to sign over the years, I make no promises about how much I can deliver.


That said, if this job sounds fun to you, or the money sounds like a great way to get rich quick, I really, really do not recommend you take it up; people like that don’t tend to last long. And for the love of all that is holy, if you are in Colorado and see a sign for a town called Rockport, TURN AROUND.
