We've officially been here for [6 days](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wek5u/im_exploring_an_abandoned_mall_with_a/) and something incredible happened.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** It's one of those damn hand things again.

&#x200B;

**SAM:** Wait, wait! He said something about a human hand, right? This one doesn't have a blue rose tattoo. I think we can pull them up.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** Well, if ya say so, I s'pose.

&#x200B;

Jack walked up to the unusually calm, unmoving hand and pulled it up.

&#x200B;

A pale, frail-looking man was on the other side. His eyes were sunken in, his stomach looked like an empty bag of skin. It looked like he hadn't eaten for millenia. I was horrified, but I couldn't look away.

&#x200B;

**???:** Well, look who it is. Jack, the man who abandoned us.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** I can't believe it, after all these years... Dan...

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Honestly, I forgive you. This has been a deeply enlightening experience. But Matt and Tom probably won't. Matt's been there way longer than I have.

&#x200B;

**SAM:** Where even is "there"?

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Dunno. Couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. I call it the Receipt Pit. I feel like that's pretty self-explanatory.

&#x200B;

**HAILEY:** Okay, enough is enough. Who the fuck is this guy and why does he look like he's starving? We should either kick him out or feed him, 'cause I can't stand looking at him. He gives me the creeps.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** You're right on that one. I haven't exactly... eaten anything in a long while. I reckon about... 20 years maybe? The Pit kept me alive. I guess it wanted to torment me for as long as possible. Little did it know, I'm a master at meditation, so my mind is in perfect condition. Almost.

&#x200B;

**SAM:** Oh my god. I could've been there for... decades.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** You almost fell in, didn't you? You're lucky your friends pulled you up. On that note, who exactly are those "friends", Jack?

&#x200B;

**JACK:** T-The most recent customers are Joshua, Avery, Sophia and Cameron.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** And what about these two?

&#x200B;

Dan gestured towards Sam and Hailey.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** They... well, it's kind of, y'know, complicated.

&#x200B;

**HAILEY:** We work for him.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Oh, I see. You found a younger, better replacement for us after we were gone. You simply replaced us. Just. Like. *That*. We've been working with you for years, Jack. And you couldn't even bother sending a team after us.

&#x200B;

The unnerving calmness in the delivery of that sentence sent shivers down my spine. God, even when Dan isn't mad, he could still be absolutely ruthless.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** I... I'm so sorry, Dan. I-... can't do this anymore.

&#x200B;

Jack fell on his knees, weeping.

&#x200B;

I've never seen Jack be so emotionally vunerable.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** In any case, what happened to Thomas? Where's he been?

&#x200B;

**AVERY:** He's been texting these weird rules to us, but they seem to be legit.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Those "weird rules" are survival tips from our stay here. They're essential to your survival, obviously.

&#x200B;

**AVERY:** Well, why don't you list a few of them off?

&#x200B;

Avery was clearly skeptical.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Well, from what I remember... Don't enter anything except for the Targets, stay away from the cracked tiles, there's no escape, stay away from the colomns, if they have a shirt and shorts with the same color, avoid them at all costs and open all unopened items...

&#x200B;

She raised an eyebrow.

&#x200B;

**AVERY:** What about those last two? We haven't encountered any colomns or... weird-looking people.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Oh, y'know, Colomn Crawlers, the Customers.

&#x200B;

**ME:** Dan, we don't really know what that is.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** What? Tom was-... He was supposed to tell you! He had the rulebook this whole time!

&#x200B;

**ME:** How the hell did you know that?

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Wait, listen, before you get all skeptical, Tom was in the Receipt Pit for a bit. Maybe a year or so, and he had his rulebook with him. He reread it over and over and over again and he remembered how Matt dissapeared and how Ruby... she... *Oh, god*...

&#x200B;

Dan dryly coughed.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** In... In any case, he reread it over and over and over again and he memorized every single rule and he promised me he'd immediately tell newcomers all of the rules, "to minimize casualties", he said. And then he got out. I don't know how he got out. I didn't see anyone pull him up. He was just... gone one day. He's-

&#x200B;

Dan suddenly fainted.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** Quick, we need food and water! The Pit can't keep him alive for long!

&#x200B;

Dan's skin slowly became more and more yellow and pale. His nails began growing into sharp, thin claws, his hands becoming thinner and thinner.

&#x200B;

Hailey tossed a water bottle to Jack. He caught it and poured the entire contents of the bottle into Dan's mouth.

&#x200B;

Dan's skin returned back to normal, but he still needed food. His nails were growing at an inhuman rate.

&#x200B;

**HAILEY:** Do something!

&#x200B;

Jack took out an EpiPen and a granola bar.

&#x200B;

Right after he jabbed the EpiPen into Dan's thigh in a desperate attempt to save him, Dan woke up, aggressively grabbed the bar out of Jack's hand and swallowed it whole.

&#x200B;

He ran over to our food supply on all fours and began eating. And he ate **everything**.

&#x200B;

Bread, snacks, sweets, raw eggs and meat, entire cans of Spam, even the mealworms in Sophia's chip bag.

&#x200B;

He ripped raw meat apart with his bare hands and shoved large, bloody chunks of beef, lamb and chicken into his mouth, ravenously tore into packages, sometimes even eating plastic wrap and cardboard. I wanted to throw up, and so did everyone else.

&#x200B;

Except for Jack. He just stood there with a thousand-yard stare. What did he feel during that moment? Pure, paralyzing fear? Fascination? Grief? We may never know.

&#x200B;

After Dan was done, he stood up right by the garbage pile he created. Although, he no longer looked ill.

&#x200B;

**DAN:** Sorry 'bout that. A desperate man's gotta do what a desperate man's gotta do.

&#x200B;

**HAILEY:** What... What the fuck is wrong with you!?

&#x200B;

Hailey looked like she was about to cry out of anger.

&#x200B;

**HAILEY:** Cam lost his fucking hand while we were trying to look for more food and I haven't heard a *single* word from Sophia ever since that happened! And you just... You can't just fucking do that and get away with it scot-free! You wasted a week's worth of food, you asshole!

&#x200B;

Dan didn't even flinch. He just sat there with a completely blank expression and sighed.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** To be fair, he was about to turn into a whatchamacallit...

&#x200B;

**SAM:** A Wall Peeker.

&#x200B;

**JACK:** Yeah, that's right. Wait, how did you know that?

&#x200B;

**SAM:** I found Tom's rulebook. It was right next to the junk pile that Dan made. It has so many rules, it's actually mind-numbing. Some of them are a bit, y'know, absolutely unhinged.

&#x200B;

Here's a transcription of some of the more... interesting ones.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 19 - I'm trapped here. There are so many receipts all around me. I feel like I'm dying but every time I feel my mind slipping away, I return back here. Please help me.*"

&#x200B;

"*RULE 37 - Once upon a time, there was a princess and a knight and one day...*"

&#x200B;

This rule described an incredibly detailed and brutal death of the knight which I will not describe here, as it is too graphic, as well as the words

&#x200B;

"*You've ruined me, Jack.*"

&#x200B;

written at the very bottom of the next page.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 100 - This is hell.*"

&#x200B;

There was a depiction of a burning stick figure in the middle of the page.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 1864 - I tried to read some of the receipts and they all just say* ***"This is salvation, Thomas."*** *and* ***"Your father is waiting for you."*** *My father is dead. He's dead HE'S DEAD HE'S DEAD HE'S DEAD WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN PLEASE JUST LET ME OUT LET ME OUT LET ME OUT LET ME OUT IM BEGGING YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME OU*"

&#x200B;

"*RULE 21256 - JOHN INNERSFIELD IS A* ***FUCKING COWARD.*** *KILL ON SIGHT. I WILL DO IT AS SOON AS I GET OUT.*"

&#x200B;

There was a realistic-looking depiction of Jack drawn with blue ink with the word "TRAITOR" repeated over and over again at the bottom of the page.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 767574 -* ***DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT MATTHEW YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHY I SENT YOU BACK DOWN HERE***"

&#x200B;

There was a note right below this rule with drastically different handwriting.

&#x200B;

"*Anyone, please help me, I'm BEGGING YOU! My name is Matthew Rae, short for Raeluceam. My brother is Samuel Raeluceam. Please, tell him to remember me. The man who has trapped me here is Th-*"

&#x200B;

There was a big, dark stain on the rest of the message.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 8742311 - THOUSANDS OF UNIVERSES DYING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN*

*IMAGINARY GALAXIES ROTTING INSIDE MY MIND AND THERES NOTHING I CAN DO ITS ALL JUST AN ENDLESS CYCLE*"

&#x200B;

This sentence was repeated 49 times on one tiny page.

&#x200B;

"*RULE 4444444 - I got out. My torment is over.*"

&#x200B;

This page was repeatedly soaked and dried out in what appeared to be tears and blood.

&#x200B;

That was the last rule in the rulebook.

&#x200B;

So many questions and so little answers. Why did Tom leave the notebook there? What happened to him? How did he go insane and then go back to being normal again? Why doesn't he want us to save the man with the blue rose tattoo? How did he get out? And more importantly, [how will we survive here without any food left?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16ebnot/im_exploring_an_abandoned_mall_with_a/)
