I was barely holding on, drifting through life like a ghost clinging to the edges of a world I didn’t belong to anymore. My twenties were supposed to be the best years of my life, but instead, I felt like I was living in the last stretch of a nightmare that wouldn’t end. I kept thinking about when it all went wrong, if there was some exact moment I could point to. Maybe it was that night… the night my family died, their screams echoing in my ears, or maybe it was something else, something that had been broken inside me long before then.

I still see the fire every time I close my eyes. I hear the crackle of flames, feel the smoke clawing at my lungs, the unbearable heat singeing my skin as I tried to reach them. I tried so hard. I clawed and fought through the burning wood, screaming their names, but the smoke was too thick, the heat too much. I made it out. I don’t even remember how. They didn’t. The darkness that swallowed them never left me. It was like something inside me died with them that night, and what was left was hollow, just a shell of who I’d been. 

I drifted after that. Nowhere felt like home. I was homeless, just moving from one place to the next, always on the edge of things. I’d look at myself in the broken shards of windows and barely recognize the person looking back—eyes sunken, skin pale and stretched tight over my bones, hair matted and unwashed. I looked like someone who was already dead.

The drugs… they came next. At first, they were an escape, a way to numb the pain, to drown out the memories that haunted me every time I closed my eyes. Pills, powders, needles—I didn’t care. Anything that could take the edge off, that could make me feel less… or maybe more. It didn’t matter. I needed something to fill the void, something to make me feel alive again, even if it was just for a moment.

But it got worse. I started to see things. Shadows moving in the corners of my vision, whispers I couldn’t quite make out. I’d feel a cold breath on the back of my neck, a touch on my shoulder, but when I’d turn around, no one was there. At first, I thought it was just the drugs, the hallucinations they warned you about in those old D.A.R.E. commercials. But the things I saw… they felt real, more real than anything else in my life. 

There was one night, one bad night, when I was in an abandoned building, squatting with a few other users. I was coming down hard, shaking, sweating, my skin crawling like it was alive. I could feel eyes on me, eyes everywhere, watching. I saw them in the walls, black and empty, staring right into my soul. I tried to ignore them, tried to convince myself they weren’t real, just another trick of the drugs. But then the whispers started. Low at first, like a breeze rustling through dead leaves, but they grew louder, more insistent, hissing my name from the shadows. 

I wanted to scream, to run, but my legs felt like lead. And then I saw her—my little sister, standing in the doorway. Her hair was matted, her clothes burned and torn, her skin pale, too pale, like she’d been drained of all color. Her eyes… God, her eyes were just empty sockets, black and bottomless, staring right at me. 

“James,” she whispered, her voice sounding like the crackling of flames. “Why didn’t you save us?”

I backed away, my heart pounding in my chest, my breath coming in ragged gasps. “You’re not real,” I muttered, “You’re not real.”

But she just kept coming, closer and closer, her burned hand reaching out for me. The smell of smoke filled the air, choking me. I turned, desperate to get away, but everywhere I looked, I saw them—my parents, my sister, their skin charred and blistered, their eyes dark pits that seemed to swallow the light.

I ran. I don’t even remember how I got out, just that I was suddenly on the street, the rain pouring down, mixing with the tears on my face. I could still hear them, still feel their eyes on me, even though I knew they were gone, had been gone for years. 

But I kept seeing them, night after night, in the shadows, in the reflections of puddles, in the faces of strangers passing by. I was losing my mind. Or maybe I already had. Rehab became my second home, but it never stuck. I'd get clean for a while, think maybe I could outrun it, but the whispers always came back, and I’d find myself with a needle in my arm or a bottle in my hand, trying to drown them out.

And then, last night… last night was the worst of all. I found myself on the edge of a bridge, staring down into the dark, churning water below. I thought about jumping. I thought about the cold rush, the silence that would follow. No more pain. No more ghosts. 

But then I felt something behind me, something cold and heavy, like a presence pressing down on me. I turned, and there was that light again, flickering in the distance, casting those long, twisted shadows. It felt like it was calling to me, pulling me in.

I don’t know why, but I started walking toward it, my feet moving on their own. I felt like I was being led… no, dragged, toward something waiting in the dark, something that knew me, something that wanted me.

And in that moment, I realized I was more afraid than I’d ever been. Because for the first time, I wasn’t sure if what I was seeing was real… or if I was finally slipping into the hell I’d been running from all along.

I kept seeing things, even when I tried not to. I'd convince myself it was all in my head, just another trick of the drugs. But it didn't matter what I believed; the shadows were always there, lurking, watching. I felt like I was on the edge of something, like if I didn’t hold on tight, I’d slip right off into whatever hell waited for me below.

I knew I needed to get it together, at least enough to get a job—anything that would keep me from going under. My health was getting worse. The drugs had torn my insides apart. I had stomach pains that twisted me up, headaches that felt like my skull was splitting open, and my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I needed money for medicine, or at least enough to keep me on my feet, to stop the constant agony from eating me alive. 

I went to the clinic a few times, but they wouldn’t help without cash. Every doctor I saw just gave me that look, like they were staring right through me, like I was already gone. “You need to get clean,” they’d say, over and over, but none of them had any answers for what I should do next. No money, no meds. No meds, more pain. And the pain just made everything else worse. It was a loop, a vicious circle I couldn’t escape.

I managed to land two jobs, and I clung to them like lifelines. The first was at a greasy fast food joint downtown. I’d show up before dawn, the place still dark and empty, and start flipping burgers, the oil and grease burning my eyes and filling my lungs. I’d smile at the customers when they came in, even when their stares made my skin crawl, even when I thought I saw shadows shifting just behind their shoulders. I kept telling myself it wasn’t real, that I was just tired, just worn down.

The other job was at a restaurant a few blocks away. Nights, mostly, scrubbing dishes until my hands bled. The kitchen was hot, the steam sticking to my skin, making my head pound. I’d hear whispers sometimes, voices I didn’t recognize, but I kept my head down, kept my hands moving. I couldn’t afford to lose either job; I needed every cent. 

I’d work back-to-back shifts, running from one job to the other, barely sleeping, barely eating. My body ached constantly, and I was so tired all the time. I’d feel my chest tighten with every breath, my hands shake as I tried to steady the dishes, or flip the patties. My vision would blur, and I’d see things out of the corner of my eye—faces in the steam, shadows darting across the tiles, flickers of movement just beyond the light. 

But I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t. I needed the money too badly. I needed the meds that might make the pain go away, even just a little. I needed something to hold on to, something that felt real.

One night, after finishing a late shift at the restaurant, I stumbled outside into the cold air, feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. My head was pounding, my vision swimming, and I could barely stand. I leaned against the wall, trying to catch my breath. That’s when I saw it again—a light flickering in the distance, brighter this time, more… inviting. I couldn’t look away. 

I felt something pull me, that same sensation from the bridge, that feeling like I was being dragged toward it, like it had its hooks in me and wouldn’t let go. My heart pounded in my chest, and I tried to turn away, tried to run. But my feet wouldn’t move. I couldn’t stop staring. 

The shadows around the light began to twist and warp, forming shapes, faces I recognized, faces that shouldn’t be there—my father, my mother, my sister, their eyes empty and black, their mouths opening in a silent scream. I closed my eyes, telling myself it wasn’t real, that I was just tired, that it was all in my head. But when I opened them again, they were still there, still waiting.

I backed away, my body trembling, my breath coming in sharp, ragged gasps. I felt like I was on the edge of something terrible, something that was waiting to swallow me whole.

But I needed to keep going. I needed the money. I needed the meds. I needed to survive… even if I wasn’t sure what I was surviving for anymore.

I was trying. God, I was trying so hard to keep it together, to do what needed to be done. At first, things seemed almost normal—if you could call anything about my life normal. I’d show up at the fast food joint early, before the sun was even up, and keep my head down, focus on the grill, the sizzle of the meat, the rhythm of the work. I thought if I kept my hands busy, kept my mind focused, maybe the shadows wouldn’t find me. Maybe I could just… push through.

At the restaurant, I did my best to blend in, to disappear among the steam and the clatter of dishes. I’d stay quiet, keep my eyes on the dirty plates, moving from sink to sink, scrubbing until my fingers were raw and bleeding. I didn’t talk to anyone unless I had to. I’d avoid eye contact because sometimes, when I looked too close, I’d see things in their faces—flickers of something dark, something that wasn’t quite human.

But it didn’t take long before people started to notice. They’d catch me staring at nothing, or jumping at shadows, my hands shaking as I worked. Once, while flipping a burger, I saw a face in the grill’s reflection—my sister, her eyes empty, her skin burned and charred—and I dropped the spatula. The hot oil splashed up, burning my arm, and I screamed, the sound tearing out of me like a wounded animal. The customers looked up, their faces twisted with confusion and a hint of fear.

The manager called me into his office that day. He looked at me like I was something stuck to the bottom of his shoe. “James,” he said, his voice low and cautious, like he was talking to a stray dog. “You’re scaring the customers. You keep zoning out, talking to yourself. You’re… distracted. I don’t know what’s going on with you, but we can’t have it here. You’re done.”

I tried to explain, to say it was just a rough patch, that I needed this job, that I’d get better. But he just shook his head, like he’d already decided. “Sorry,” he said, but his eyes were cold. “I can’t help you.”

I left without saying another word, my head buzzing, my chest tight. I still had the other job. I could make it work. I had to.

But it wasn’t long before things got worse at the restaurant. The whispers in the kitchen grew louder, more insistent. I’d hear my name, called from the shadows, from behind the closed doors of the walk-in freezer. “James… James…” over and over, a low, breathy chant. I’d turn, but no one was there. The other workers started avoiding me, their eyes darting away when I looked at them. 

Then there was the night I saw her again, standing in the doorway to the dish pit, just a silhouette at first, but I knew it was her. My little sister, her hair matted, her face half-burned, one eye a black, empty socket. She was staring right at me, her mouth moving, but no sound coming out. I dropped a stack of plates; they shattered on the floor, and I fell back, clutching my chest, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps.

The chef rushed over, his face flushed with anger. “What the hell, James?” he shouted, grabbing me by the arm. “You’re freaking everyone out. You keep talking to yourself, seeing things that aren’t there. I don’t know what you’re on, but you can’t do that here. You’re done. Get out.”

I tried to argue, to say I wasn’t on anything, that I needed this job, that I just… needed help. But he wouldn’t listen. He shoved me toward the back door, and I stumbled out into the alley, the cold night air hitting my face like a slap.

I stood there for a moment, stunned, my heart pounding in my chest. I felt the world spinning around me, faster and faster, the shadows stretching and twisting, reaching out for me. I was back where I’d started—no job, no money, no way to get the meds I needed, no way to keep the pain at bay.

I was losing everything, slipping further into the darkness, and I didn’t know how to stop it. I could feel something closing in, something hungry, something that wanted me.

I was terrified… because I was starting to think maybe it was me.

I sat alone in my cramped, dark apartment, staring at the flickering TV screen. The walls seemed to close in around me, pressing tighter with each breath I took. My hands were still shaking from the panic of being fired from both jobs, the reality of it sinking in like a knife. I felt like the floor had dropped out from under me, like I was falling through empty space, and I had no idea where I’d land.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the future, the empty days stretching out ahead of me, one after another, like a line of dominos waiting to fall. How was I supposed to survive? I had nothing—no job, no money, no way to get the medicine I needed to keep the pain at bay. My stomach twisted in knots, a dull ache spreading through my body. I’d been scraping by on what little I had left, and now even that was gone.

The shadows in the corners of the room seemed to grow darker, thicker, like they were creeping toward me, reaching out with long, twisted fingers. I could feel their cold breath on my neck, hear the low, whispering voices circling in my mind. My family’s voices, calling my name over and over in a low, mournful chant. I pressed my hands to my ears, trying to drown them out, but they only grew louder, more insistent. 

I needed a way out, some kind of lifeline, anything to keep from sinking deeper into the darkness. I stared at the TV, not really seeing it, my mind drifting, when an advertisement caught my eye. The screen flickered, showing a bright, cheerful logo—a cartoonish little character bouncing around, waving a tiny sign that read: “Tiny Task! Need a job? Need extra cash? We’ve got the answer for you!”

The ad shifted to show a young woman with a bright smile, standing in front of a sleek, modern office. “Are you struggling to make ends meet? Feeling like you’re out of options? Tiny Task is here to help! We specialize in finding small jobs, quick gigs, and easy tasks that anyone can do from home. No experience necessary! Just sign up, and we’ll match you with the perfect opportunity. Call now and start earning today!”

The screen flashed with a phone number and a website link, the woman’s voice bright and encouraging. “Don’t wait—take control of your future now! Tiny Task is the solution you’ve been looking for!”

I stared at the screen, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew it was probably a scam, just another trick to lure in desperate people like me. But what choice did I have? I needed something, anything, to keep going, to keep the ghosts at bay. I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking as I dialed the number, my breath catching in my throat.

The line rang once, twice, and then clicked over to a cheerful, automated voice. “Welcome to Tiny Task! We’re so glad you called. Please hold while we connect you to one of our representatives who can help you find the perfect opportunity!”

I waited, listening to the tinny hold music, my heart thudding in my ears. I felt a strange mix of hope and dread, like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, not sure whether I’d fly or fall.

The line clicked again, and a warm, friendly voice came through. “Hi there! Thank you for calling Tiny Task. How can we help you today?”

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry, and forced the words out. “I… I need a job,” I said, my voice barely more than a whisper. “I need something… anything.”

The voice on the other end chuckled softly. “You’ve come to the right place, my friend. We’ve got just the thing for you. All you need to do is follow a few simple steps, and you’ll be on your way to earning money in no time. Are you ready to get started?”

I nodded, even though I knew they couldn’t see me. “Yeah,” I whispered. “I’m ready.”

“Great!” the voice replied, a hint of excitement in their tone. “We’re going to help you turn things around. Just you wait… your luck is about to change.” 

I didn’t know why, but something about the way they said it sent a shiver down my spine. The shadows in the room seemed to shift, drawing closer, like they were listening. I held my breath, clutching the phone tighter, feeling a strange sense of unease.

But I needed this. I needed something to hold on to. And I was willing to do whatever it took… even if it meant stepping into the unknown.

“Okay,” I said, my voice trembling just a little. “What do I need to do?”

The next day, I found myself standing outside the office building where Tiny Task had told me to go. It was a sleek, modern place with mirrored windows that seemed to swallow the morning light. My reflection stared back at me, hollow-eyed and tired, and I could see my breath in the cold air as I waited.

The lobby was bright and clean, filled with plants and cheery posters advertising all kinds of odd jobs: dog walking, flyer delivery, virtual assistant gigs—stuff that seemed simple enough, easy enough. I hoped whatever they had for me would be just as straightforward. I needed this job. I needed the money. I couldn’t afford to mess this up.

A smiling receptionist led me to a small room in the back where a man in a crisp suit waited. He had a friendly, practiced smile, the kind that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “James,” he said, shaking my hand a bit too firmly. “Glad you could make it. We’ve got a great little job for you today. Easy, quick, and it pays well.”

I nodded, trying to hide the unease bubbling in my stomach. “Yeah, I’m ready. What do you need me to do?”

He handed me a set of keys, a nervous grin on his face. “We’ve got a car out back that needs a good cleaning. Just a simple detail job—inside and out. Shouldn’t take more than an hour. And for your trouble, we’ll pay you five hundred dollars. Cash.”

My eyes widened at the amount. Five hundred dollars? Just to clean a car? That was more than I made in a week at either of my old jobs. I couldn’t believe it. “Five hundred?” I repeated, my voice a mix of disbelief and hope. 

The man nodded, his smile widening. “That’s right. We pay well for good work. Just head around back to the parking garage. You’ll find the car waiting for you. It’s a black sedan, plate number 8Y3-K2R. Can’t miss it.”

I took the keys, muttering a quick “Thanks,” before heading out to the parking garage. My heart was pounding in my chest, a mix of nerves and excitement. This could be it—the break I needed, a chance to get back on my feet, to start pulling myself out of this hole I’d been sinking into for so long.

The garage was dark and cold, shadows stretching out between the rows of cars. I found the black sedan easily, parked in a far corner, away from the other vehicles. It looked normal enough from the outside, just a bit dusty, like it had been sitting there for a while. I opened the driver’s side door, and the musty smell hit me immediately—stale air and something faintly metallic.

I grabbed a rag and some cleaner from a cart nearby and started wiping down the dashboard, trying to keep my mind from wandering, from drifting back to the shadows that always seemed to be watching. I moved to the back seat, scrubbing at a few scuff marks on the upholstery when I saw it.

Blood. 

There were faint, reddish stains on the seat cushions, barely visible in the dim light, but unmistakable. My breath caught in my throat, and my hands froze. I blinked, trying to convince myself it was just a trick of the light, but when I reached down and touched the fabric, my fingers came away sticky and red.

My heart began to race, my palms slick with sweat. I forced myself to keep going, pulling open the back door. I needed to see if there was more—needed to know what I was dealing with. As the door swung open, I stumbled back, my stomach lurching.

There, slumped in the back seat, was a woman’s body. Her eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the ceiling, her skin pale and waxy. She was wearing a white dress, now stained red with blood that had soaked into the fabric. Her hands were limp, one arm dangling off the edge of the seat, a small pool of blood gathering beneath her.

I felt my throat tighten, a scream building inside me, but no sound came out. I backed away, dropping the rag and cleaner, my hands trembling. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I needed to get out, needed to call someone, to report this. I fumbled for my phone and dialed the number Tiny Task had given me, my fingers shaking so badly I nearly dropped the phone.

The line clicked, and the same warm, friendly voice answered. “Tiny Task, how can we assist you?”

“There’s… there’s a body,” I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper. “In the car… there’s blood everywhere… a woman…”

The voice on the other end paused, then laughed softly. “I think you might be mistaken, James. There’s no body in that car. Maybe you should take another look.”

I frowned, my breath coming in shallow, panicked gasps. “No… no, I saw her! She’s right there, in the back seat! I’m not imagining it!”

“Just check again,” the voice said, still calm, still friendly. “You’ll see.”

My hand was trembling as I lowered the phone and slowly turned back to the car, my heart pounding in my chest. I took a step closer, peering through the open door, my breath hitching in my throat.

The back seat was empty. No body. No blood. Just a clean, pristine interior, the white dress I had seen now folded neatly on the seat, spotless, untouched.

I blinked, rubbing my eyes, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I felt dizzy, my head spinning, my thoughts a tangled mess. “I… I swear I saw…” I muttered to myself, backing away.

“Are you okay, James?” the voice on the phone asked, a hint of concern in their tone.

I swallowed hard, feeling my throat tighten. “Yeah,” I whispered, more to myself than to them. “Yeah… I’m fine. I must have… I must have been seeing things again.”

The voice chuckled softly. “No worries, James. Just finish up the task, and the money will be yours. You’re doing great.”

I nodded, my mind still reeling, trying to push away the images, trying to convince myself it was all in my head. Just another hallucination, another trick of my broken mind.

But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.

I finished cleaning the car, my hands still shaking, but at least the money was real. The crisp, green bills felt like a lifeline as I stuffed them into my pocket. It was enough to get my medications, to ease the pain that had been clawing at me for so long. For a moment, the shadows seemed to recede, and I dared to hope that maybe, just maybe, things might start to turn around.

The next day, I returned to Tiny Task’s office, feeling a mix of anxiety and anticipation. I needed the money, and the jobs they offered seemed to pay more than anything else I could find. When I walked in, the same cheerful receptionist greeted me with a smile. “Good to see you again, James! Ready for your next task?”

I nodded, trying to ignore the unease gnawing at my insides. “Yeah, I’m ready. What’s the job?”

The man in the suit met me in the small room again, his smile just as practiced. “We’ve got a new task for you. It’s a bit different this time, but it pays well—fifteen hundred dollars. All you need to do is clean a grave. It’s a bit unusual, but it shouldn’t be too hard.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “A grave?” I repeated, my voice laced with disbelief. “Why would a grave need cleaning?”

The man’s smile didn’t waver. “It’s a special request. The family wants it done before the next ceremony. Just follow the instructions we’ll give you, and you’ll be done in no time. Think of it as a unique opportunity.”

Fifteen hundred dollars. My mind spun with the possibilities. It was a lot of money, more than I’d seen in a long time. Despite my growing apprehension, I knew I couldn’t pass it up. I needed every cent I could get.

He handed me a set of instructions and directions to a cemetery on the outskirts of town. I followed the directions, my stomach twisting with a mix of fear and anticipation. The cemetery was quiet and desolate, the graves arranged in neat rows beneath the gray sky. I found the grave marked in the instructions, a simple headstone with a name and date that meant nothing to me.

I started working, clearing away debris and weeds, scrubbing the headstone and the surrounding area. My hands moved mechanically, my thoughts drifting back to the shadows that always seemed to lurk just out of sight. The cemetery was eerily silent, the only sound the faint rustle of leaves and my own labored breathing.

As I worked, I noticed something strange about the headstone. The name and date carved into it were familiar, but I couldn’t quite place them. I kept scrubbing, my mind racing, when I finally looked up and froze.

The name on the headstone was mine. My full name, the date of death marked as today’s date. My breath caught in my throat, and I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. I stared at the inscription, my heart pounding in my chest.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light, a cruel joke my mind was playing on me. But when I looked again, the name was still there, staring back at me. My hands trembled as I continued to clean, my movements jerky and frantic.

I could feel panic rising in my chest, my thoughts spinning out of control. Was this some kind of sick game? A message from the shadows that had been haunting me? I tried to steady my breathing, pushing through the fear that was clawing at me. 

I finished the task as quickly as I could, my heart racing, my mind a tangled mess of terror and confusion. I tried to convince myself it was just another hallucination, just another trick of the shadows that always seemed to be lurking.

When I returned to Tiny Task’s office, I handed over the completed job report, the man in the suit accepting it with a smile. “You did great, James. Here’s your payment.”

I took the envelope with the cash, my hands still shaking. I thanked him, my voice barely above a whisper. I couldn’t get out of there fast enough, the weight of what I had seen pressing down on me.

As I left the office, I tried to calm my racing heart, to push the images out of my mind. I had the money I needed for my medications, but the fear and unease lingered, gnawing at me like the shadows that always seemed to follow.

I told myself it was just a bad dream, a trick of my mind. I had to believe that, or I’d lose my grip on reality entirely. As I walked away, the darkness seemed to close in around me, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that something far worse was waiting just beyond the edge of the shadows.


With the fifteen hundred dollars in hand, I managed to get my medications and a few extra supplies to help with my health. For a short while, it felt like things were finally starting to look up. I continued working with Tiny Task, completing each job as it came, always pushing through the unease that clung to me like a second skin.

The tasks varied from day to day—cleaning offices, delivering packages, running errands. The work was often mundane, sometimes strange, but it kept me afloat, kept me moving. The pay was good, and I was grateful for the income. I did my best to focus on the jobs, to stay busy and keep my mind occupied.

But despite the relief the money brought, the shadows never really left me. They were always lurking, shifting in the corners of my vision, whispering in the dark. I’d catch glimpses of them in the mirror, in the reflections of windows, always just out of reach. They seemed to grow darker with each passing day, a constant, creeping presence that I couldn’t shake.

At work, I’d find myself jumping at the smallest noises, my hands trembling as I moved from one task to the next. I’d see fleeting shapes darting across walls, hear murmurs that sounded almost like my name. I told myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me, that the stress and exhaustion were getting to me.

I’d try to keep busy, to drown out the creeping paranoia by throwing myself into the work. Sometimes, I’d talk to myself, whispering reassurances, telling myself it was all just in my head. It was the only way I could get through the day without falling apart. But the whispers never stopped, and the shadows seemed to grow thicker, more tangible, like they were closing in on me from all sides.

One evening, after finishing a particularly grueling job, I sat alone in my small apartment, the dim light from a single lamp casting long shadows across the walls. I tried to relax, to focus on the TV, but the flickering images only seemed to make the shadows dance more aggressively.

I glanced at the clock—late, too late to call anyone, too late to do anything but try to sleep. I got up, feeling the familiar tightness in my chest, and moved to the kitchen for a glass of water. As I filled the glass, I caught a glimpse of movement in the darkened hallway. My heart leaped into my throat, and I spun around, but the hallway was empty.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. “Just tired,” I muttered. “Just seeing things.”

I tried to shake off the feeling, but it clung to me. I lay down on my bed, staring at the ceiling, my mind racing. I kept thinking about the grave, the name on the headstone. It felt like a message, a warning. I couldn’t escape the feeling that something was waiting for me, something I couldn’t quite understand but knew was coming.

Sleep came fitfully, plagued by nightmares of dark figures and empty graves. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, the shadows in my room stretching and shifting in the dim light, my breathing shallow and rapid.

Despite everything, I kept going, kept working, and kept taking the pills that helped dull the pain. I tried to focus on the little victories—the times when I’d complete a job and earn enough to buy groceries, to pay the bills, to keep myself going. But no matter how hard I tried, the shadows were always there, a persistent, oppressive presence that I couldn’t escape.

And the longer I worked for Tiny Task, the more I wondered if they were somehow connected to the darkness that followed me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was in deeper than I’d ever realized, that each task I completed was pulling me further into something I didn’t fully understand.

As I continued with the work, I tried to hold on to the hope that maybe, just maybe, things would get better. I hoped the shadows would eventually fade, that the fear and anxiety would diminish. But for now, all I could do was keep moving forward, keep working, and try to ignore the creeping darkness that seemed to follow me wherever I went.

One morning, I received a new assignment from Tiny Task that seemed almost too good to be true. I was to work for an elderly couple living in a house out in the countryside. The job was set to last for four days and involved a variety of tasks—cleaning their house, cutting the grass, and doing some grocery shopping. For all this, they were offering a hefty sum of five thousand dollars.

The prospect was enticing. It was more money than I’d ever made in one go, and the idea of working somewhere out in the countryside seemed like a chance for a change of pace, a brief escape from the shadows that always seemed to be lurking in the corners of my life.

I packed my things, filled with a mix of relief and apprehension, and set out for the couple's home. The drive took me through winding roads, past rolling fields and dense woods, until I finally arrived at a charming, weathered farmhouse surrounded by a sprawling lawn.

The house was picturesque, with ivy climbing up the old stone walls and flower beds bursting with color. I took a deep breath, trying to savor the fresh country air, and headed to the front door, ready to start what I hoped would be a straightforward job.
