I saw youtube videos about reddit story encounters and found it a very interesting place to share my experience as well, this is my first reddit post here and I am not very good at English and Story telling but I will try my best.



I am 20 male, I live in the Philippines at a government relocation site (made for typhoon/flood (typhoon "Sendong") Macapaya Camaman-an Relocation site. This area was once a garden of nothing but mountains and woods until the government decided to build houses as shelters for flood victims so we we're basically surrounded by woods and nothing else. I lived here since year 2015 when I decided to move in with my parents since I grew up in my grandparent's place.



 Capturing spiders and making them fight with each other for entertainment is a common hobby in our place, I did a google picture find and discovered that these spiders are called Neoscona something. I on the other hand have been capturing these spiders as a hobby and selling them to people and kids at my place, I don't really earn much but I'm mainly doing it for the fun factor (collecting, capturing, and making them fight). The best time that I start my hunt is around 5 to 6 pm because during that time the spiders are a lot more noticeable because they are currently building their web house thingy. 



 I've been doing this for years and I genuinely have 0 fear whenever I'm hunting at the dead of the night, It was a bit scary at first but then after doing it for like almost 4 years now and never encountering anything supernatural I kinda made the woods my 2nd home, I love being in the woods, I spend most of my time laying bird traps and other stuffs and something about the woods just makes me feel at peace sometimes I'd setup my duyan or hammock and then turn all the lights off and hearing cicadas and crickets and watching fireflies is something I find blissful. Something about the woods is just so magical to me, until last year November 17, 2023 the last time that I went to the woods at night alone and probably the last time that I will.



 I was doing my usual night hunt and around 4am, I was at a corn field and I laid down my flashlight facing upwards on the grass as I was trying to track a web line which lead me to pick up and open a dried corn's skin to inspect if there's a spider inside. Suddenly out of nowhere. I found myself having a hard time breathing not because I couldn't breathe but because I was instinctively trying to breathe as quiet as possible, knowing instinctively for the first time in my whole life as an atheist and 4 years of experience hunting at the same area I felt something was behind me, I felt the weight of the air and the atmosphere press down on me as if I'm being crushed on the ground, I was in a duck position because I was trying to shine the light on a corn that I picked up but the fear stole the strength in my knees.



 Something was behind me, I wasn't looking but I know something was behind me, after I snapped to reality and somewhat calmed myself down I decided to slowly put the corn down and grab my flashlight, I pretended as if I'm unaware of whatever that being's presence and decided to walk forward hoping I could put a distance between us ( I don't know how far we we're from each other ). after around 10-15 meters I think, I decided to do what I now regret and caused me to never go back to the woods alone again. 



Out of curiosity(mostly stupidity) I looked back and pointed the flashlight at it. I ran, I don't remember thinking about running but my body instinctively knew that during that time I was a prey, It was as if a rabbit seeing a lion and ran on its own, my whole body was feeling numb and I ran without stopping despite not hearing any signs of that thing chasing me. I arrived at my house, went inside my room and I found myself staring into nothing until morning, couldn't sleep and thinking about what it was.



 It was a tall skinny naked furless human like being with no genitalia, it had a pale complexion and bulging veins all over its body (looks like an uncircumsized penis but wasn't funny at all during that time, only now that I'm typing) with its pair of eerie eyes that's almost exactly like that of a spider that pierced through my very soul that night, It had a slit at the center of its face which I'm not sure if it's the nose or mouth. 



to be honest now that I'm typing it it sounds kind of funny but the fact that this being was just standing there menacingly doing nothing but staring at me and gave me the most fearful moment of my life was something that I know I will never forget.
