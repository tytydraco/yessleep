I still don’t know how to explain what happened without sounding insane, but I need to get it out before I forget pieces of it. I deleted and rewrote this three times because every version sounds too neat, like something someone would script. This is how it really felt, messy and half-remembered.

For context, I live alone on the top floor of an old apartment building. The landlord is a guy who never fixes anything right, the pipes clank like they’re having their own conversations, and the hallway light flickers in the exact same pattern every night. I work night shifts at a supermarket so I sleep during the day. It’s a weird schedule, but it paid the bills and kept me isolated, which I kind of liked.

A few weeks ago I came home around 8 a.m., exhausted, and passed out on the couch. I had my phone on the coffee table and a podcast still playing on the speaker at a low volume. I woke up two hours later because the podcast cut out mid-sentence. The speaker had switched itself to radio static and there was a faint thumping coming from my bedroom wall, like someone knocking lightly but rhythmically. I thought it was the neighbors, but the knocks were three quick taps, a pause, then two slow ones. It felt deliberate.

I got up, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders, and went to my bedroom door. The knocks stopped the moment I reached it. I listened for a while. In an old building you get good at guessing where sounds come from so you can blame them on something normal. This time the noise was inside the room, like someone was on the other side of the wall that my headboard touched. The radiator hissed. The building settled. I laughed at myself and went back to the living room, but I couldn’t get comfortable.

That night I couldn’t sleep properly. Every time I drifted off I had this impression someone was standing at the foot of the bed watching me sleep. Not an intruder feeling, more like a weight. I chalked it up to exhaustion and slept for a few hours before my alarm for work went off. The weirdness stuck like a taste in my mouth, soft and persistent.

Over the next week the knocks became regular. Always three quick, pause, two slow. Always when I was trying to fall asleep. I taped a note to the wall on a whim, childish, like an experiment. “If that’s you, knock once.” I laughed at myself putting it there and kind of expected nothing. That night, three quick, pause, two slow. Then one sharp, single tap right in the middle of the night. The note was still where I put it in the morning.

I started recording. My phone sat on the bedside table as I fell asleep. In the morning the file would be full of room noise and, a few hours in, a single, unmistakable phrase caught by the microphone. It was not words exactly, more like syllables dragged low through the pipes. Sometimes it sounded like “here,” sometimes “stay,” sometimes nothing I could pin down. Once, clearer than anything before, it sounded like my name.

When something crosses that line between coincidence and intent, you change. I began to leave lights on, to keep my phone plugged in, to check the door twice. I would wake up tangled in the blanket and see the shape of a person in the corner for a second, then it would be gone. I told myself it was a combination of the radio static, the building settling, and sleep deprivation. I told my friend over text and he made some jokes and told me to move out. That night the knocks were slower, deliberate, very close.

The next morning I found scratches on the wall behind the headboard. Small, like fingernails, forming no word I could read. I remember touching them, how cold the plaster felt under my fingers. I didn’t tell anyone. I bought a cheap plug-in recorder and left it running all day and night for three days. When I listened back I heard normal daytime sounds, the city, the kettle, the neighbor’s door slamming. At 3:12 a.m. on the second night there was a breathing sound on the file, not mine. It matched the rhythm I’d felt when I couldn’t sleep. The audio then cut, and the last thirty seconds is nothing but a low, sustained noise that made my teeth ache when I played it through headphones.

I started seeing small things move in the corner of my eye. A chair slightly shifted, a picture frame turned face down, my phone would be angled differently on the table when I woke up than when I fell asleep. I began setting silly traps. I placed small objects on the floor—bottle caps, a pen—and checked them in the morning. Sometimes they were in the same place. Once, the pen was gone and there were three deep dents in the carpet where it must have been pressed.

I thought about the rational options: mice, sleepwalking, an asshole neighbor. I filmed myself asleep to catch me getting up, but the footage never showed the motion I expected. The nights I played the footage back, I watched myself lie perfectly still while something in the room shifted the way my ear hears a sound move across space. In one clip the blanket flutters as if by a breeze, but the window is closed, the AC off. Something passes over the camera’s lens, a shadow like fabric, but thicker, like a shawl dragged very slowly.

The last straw was my phone. I woke up at 4 a.m. and checked it because the static on the radio had become a background hum in my skull. There were three unread voice messages. I don’t leave my phone to record by the bed, someone else had to have left them there. Each message was thirty seconds of nothing. No voice, nothing, until the very end where a breath exhaled right into the microphone and something said, clearly, “Don’t leave.”

I packed a bag. I told myself I would go to a friend’s place for a night and then decide. When I opened my closet to grab a jacket the coat hanger scraped against the wood like fingernails. There are marks along the inside of the closet door now, parallel, like someone traced the length of the frame with their nails. I didn’t take them for granted.

I left. I didn’t look back. I slept at my friend’s place on a couch that smelled faintly of cigarettes and felt a stupid relief. In the morning I texted myself a reminder to go back and get the rest of my things, and when I opened my phone the text showed as delivered at 5:03 a.m. the night before, timestamped while I was on the couch, asleep.

I never went back. The landlord called once asking if I’d left the keys. He sounded like he was reading a script. I still get the impulse to check the thread of messages I left myself that night because I think they will contain some explanation, a clue I missed. But I stopped listening to the recordings. I don’t want to hear the breath at the end. I don’t want to hear anything that sounds like my own name said by someone who is not me.

If you think I could just be dramatic, go back and read the timestamps on your own messages. Ask anyone who lives in an old building how easy it is to believe your walls are just settling, until they are not. I don’t know what was in my apartment. Maybe it was loneliness given teeth. Maybe it was the house itself, tired of being a box. Maybe it was something that learned how to imitate the pauses between my breaths.

I have a copy of the last audio file saved in a folder I never open. Sometimes at night, when the world is quiet and my phone is on the table, I imagine three quick taps, a pause, two slow. It feels like a pulse now, like a metronome marking time for something that learned the pattern of my sleep. I keep telling myself I was lucky to leave when I did, but sometimes I wake up and for one breath I am still on that couch, and I feel the weight at the foot of the bed, and the world narrows to a single, impossible voice saying, “Stay.”
