I’ve gone back and forth on posting this, but what I found is consuming me whole. About a week or so ago, I found and explored an old mansion outside of **\[REDACTED\]** that’s been abandoned for years. It belonged to some freaky ass historian, eccentric Elias Roth. Supposedly, he passed under mysterious circumstances. The only thing I could find online was a vague obituary and some of his published works. The guy was a kook. 



The place was a wreck. The furniture was rotting, windows had been smashed in, the works. It looks like it used to be the study before nature lapped at it thirstily. There was a desk, half falling apart and standing only on one side. All of the contents were thrown, some eaten by the elements and some half fluttering, the other half painted and plastered to the floor with caked mud. There was a crumbling map stuck in the corner, pushed upright with the draft and wind. It made absolutely zero fucking sense, it just showed a small town in the middle of nowhere. There wasn’t a name listed, but a small strange symbol etched next to it in dark blue bleeding ink. I ignored it for a while, but it sat in the corner, staring at me. It felt wrong. I tore through the desk, lifting rotting papers and blowing the webs of spiders from tickling up my arm. 



I found a brown leather bound journal. It did not belong to Roth. I’m not a detective or a psychic or medium, the name Lydia Crane was sprawled messily on the top left corner of the first page. The entries were chaotic, smudged in ink. 



“I’ve been hired to archive the estate of Elias Roth, a fellow historian with a reputation for hoarding strange artifacts. The mansion is enormous. And falling apart. The job pays well, hoping it will keep me busy. Found a map today, tucked into an old book. There’s a town on it that doesn’t exist, strange symbols.”



“I keep coming back to the map. I found some of Roth’s notes about the town. Called it ‘a place outside of time’ ? The symbols are repeated in his journals. ‘Stay in the light’.”



“Following the map.”



“The town is real, I got here yesterday. The sun doesn’t set. Bright all the time. Wrong. No shadows?? People are very friendly.”



“‘Stay in the light, it’s not safe in the dark’ There is no dark???”



“All roads loop back into town.”



“Staying at an old inn. Shadows are back? Looked like a smudge at first, growing stronger. Does not move when I move.”



“Found a room at the inn today. There was a picture of me as a child. Holding my mom’s hand, in town. I don’t remember? Did she come here?”



“Confronted the innkeeper. The town remembers everyone??? Forgetting things, small things. Symbols make sense. Not warnings, instructions. Shadow moves by itself.”



“Light is breaking. People in town are panicking. Watching me, whispering things I can’t hear. Shadow is not mine.”



“Comi”



The entries got more frantic as they went. The last entry was written in huge, shaky letters. The rest of the journal is empty, other than some distasteful sketches from some of the precious visitors. I took pictures of them, but I didn’t want to take anything. Not trying to get possessed or haunted or whatever the fuck is going on. 



I didn’t touch anything else and I hauled ass out of there. 



I shouldn’t have. 



There’s something moving in the corner of my room while I'm writing this. It doesn’t have a shadow.
