**I ain't no expert on fitness,** but I know one thing for damn sure: it ain't for the weak-of-heart. You wanna get into shape, you gotta be ready to suffer.

What I see these days, with all these wannabe fitness junkies runnin’ around, it's like they're lookin’ for a shortcut to the good life. A quick fix. They think they can just pop a couple of pills and drink some fancy juice and BOOM! They're ripped.

It don’t work that like.

I remember when I first started to lift. I was a skinny little rat, and I wanted to be big and strong like Rambo. So, I went to the gym and I started pumpin’ iron. It was tough. I was sore as hell all the time, and I didn't see a god damn result for months. But I kept at it, every fuckin’ day, week after week, month on month. Now look at me, I’m a fuckin’ Adonis.

And let me tell you kid, there's always a price to pay for shortcuts. I found that out the hard way.

I was at the gym, just like any other day, when I noticed a new guy. He was big, real fuckin’ big, and he was takin’ a whole bunch of pills and drinkin’ some kinda juice. I didn't pay him too much mind, but somethin’ about him was off. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I knew in my fuckin’ bones he was a bastard.

So, I walked over to the guy, and offered him some assistance. "You look like you could use a spotter" I said, tryin’ to be friendly and do some diggin’ at the same time.

He looked at me, his eyes bulgin’ a little. "I don't need your fuckin’ help" he growled, “Get the fuck outta here.”

“Whatever you say, buddy.”

A bastard, just like I thought. I shrugged it off and walked away. It wasn't until later that night when I found out just how much of a bastard he was.

I was walkin’ home from the gym. It was late and the streets were dead quiet with no one around. But as I turned a corner, I saw him at the end of the street. His fuckin’ eyes were poppin’ outta his skull, his muscles had swollen to an unnatural size, leavin’ ugly stretch marks on his skin, and all of his veins stood proud, like thick ropes ready to snap.

He was out of his fuckin’ mind, strung out on his pills and his juice, and he just kept going faster and faster, until he caught right up with me. That’s when I knew it was goin’ down, and it wasn't gonna be me goin’.

Without warnin’ he lunged directly at me, swingin’ his huge arms through the air. I dodged, narrowly avoidin’ a clobberin’. I swung back, but he was nimble too, and countered with a punch of his own, connectin’ with my jaw and sendin’ me flyin’, with little stars goin’ round my head.

I hit the ground with a thud, bolts of pain shootin’ through my body. But I couldn't stay down. I had to get up and keep fightin’. I pulled myself up to feet, and dusted myself off. The bastard was comin’ at me again, and this time, I was fuckin’ ready.

He swung and I juked him, swingin’ back, hittin’ him in ugly bulbous face. But the bastard refused to fall, Instead, he did somethin’ that I never expected. He unhinged his fuckin’ jaw, like a fuckin’ python, and let out a horrifyin’ roar that shook the very earth underneath our feet. I was truly terrified at his transformation. I had to end this, and fast.

Lungin’ forward, I clenched my fists, ready to land the final blow on his head. But he was so quick, his jerked himself out the way, dodgin’ my attack, then he lunged at me again, this time his fuckin’ mouth gaping. The bastard was gonna swallow me whole!

I had to think fast. I looked around for somethin’, anythin’, that could help me. My eyes landed on a nearby metal pipe, and I knew that was my chance. I grabbed it, and swung it with all my strength, connectin’ with his jaw.

There was a sickenin’ crunch, and he let out a guttural cry.

He staggered back, but he didn't fall. The bastard’s jaw was splintered and hangin’ broken, I knew that I had hurt him. But I also knew that it wasn't enough. I swung the pipe again and again, only now I was aiming at his head. Over, and over I connected with his cranium, I felt his fuckin’ skull crack inward, I kept going until I felt his body goin’ limp, and even after that I just kept goin’ and goin’.

Finally, after maybe 5 minutes, I knelt there over his newly excavated skull, pantin’ and sweatin’. My body ached from the fight and my hands covered in blood and brains. I had won.

I had defeated the bastard and survived.

So a warnin’, to all the wannabe fitness junkies out there, don't be fooled by the promise of a shortcut to the good life.

‘Cause sometimes, the price you pay is your fuckin’ life.
