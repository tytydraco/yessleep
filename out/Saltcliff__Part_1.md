I’ve always had vivid dreams. Usually stress dreams—falling off rooftops, showing up to class with no pants, that kind of thing.

But these aren’t dreams.

They’re memories. Only… they’re not mine.

They belong to someone else. A boy, a few years younger than me. His name’s Malik. I only know that because people say it around him—around me. It’s like I’m living his life, one night at a time.

Same dusty town. Same girl with frizzy hair and gray dresses. Same four bells every morning. And fire—always fire, somewhere nearby, even if it’s just the smell. Smoke woven into the seams of your clothes. Ash collecting under your nails. After a while, you start to feel like you’re breathing through charcoal.

At first, I thought I was going crazy. I started writing everything down just to prove to myself it wasn’t real. But the more I wrote, the more it all started lining up with things I shouldn’t know. Names. Rituals. Geography. I even tried Googling the town—Saltcliff, North Carolina—but there’s nothing. No population data, no history, no Wikipedia page. Just one abandoned map reference from the 1940s, labeled incomplete survey.

And then I made the mistake of telling my mom.

I said I’d been having dreams about a girl named Lila.

She froze.

Then she asked, very quietly, “Where did you hear that name?”

I told her I didn’t know. Just a dream. She didn’t believe me—I could tell. She dropped the subject after that, but something changed. Things in the house feel different now. Heavier. I keep catching her watching me when she thinks I’m not paying attention, like she’s trying to recognize something that shouldn’t be there.

So I’m posting here. Not for karma, not for fun. I just… need to know if anyone else has heard of this place. Saltcliff. The bells. The bonfires. The fire god.

Here’s what happened last night.


The first bell shakes the walls.

I’m already awake. The air is thick and hot, and my skin feels glued to the mattress. My shirt clings to my back, soaked through. It’s not even dawn, but the heat’s already pressing in. That’s how Saltcliff is. It doesn’t ease you into the day. It smothers you in it.

The second bell rings.

No one moves. You’re not supposed to—not during the bells. Not until the last one. It’s not a rule anyone says aloud, but everyone follows it.

The third bell slices through the air like a blade.

I hear Lila shift in the room next to mine. Her mattress creaks once. She’s always awake for the bells too. Once, she told me she hears them even in her dreams. She said it like it was normal. I didn’t ask what she meant. I think I was afraid she’d tell me.

The fourth bell falls, low and final.

Four bells. Always four. One for each flame. Anything else is wrong.

I sit up slowly, legs heavy with heat and sleep. My feet touch the floorboards—already warm. I run a hand through my damp hair. The fan in the corner clicks like it’s working up the nerve to spin. It never does.

As I pass Lila’s door on the way to the kitchen, I find her standing in the hallway, staring out the window. Her hair’s pulled back in a messy braid, though strands have escaped and cling to her damp neck. She’s wearing her plain gray cotton dress, the one with the frayed hem. Her arms hang loosely at her sides.

“They’re early,” she says without turning.

“No,” I murmur, rubbing my eyes. “They’re the same.”

“They felt early.”

Outside, the bottle trees rattle. Dozens of colored bottles—green, blue, brown—hang from the bare branches along the fence line. They’re meant to keep things away. Spirits, or something worse. No one says exactly what. You just grow up knowing they matter.

We don’t say much over breakfast. Mama’s already gone to the sewing hall. Daddy’s in the fields. It’s just Lila and me. The house is still except for the soft clinking of bottles in the breeze and the occasional groan of settling wood.

We take the long way to school, past the back of the tannery. The shortcut reeks—rot, brine, and something I can’t name. But it’s better than walking past the grain silos where they post the fire notices.

Lila stops suddenly beside a fence where the dust gathers thick. She crouches and draws something in the dirt with a stick.

“Look,” she says.

It’s a circle. Four little ticks—north, south, east, west.

“It’s the town,” she tells me.

I frown. “You shouldn’t draw that.”

She adds four tiny flames, one at each tick. Then closes the circle.

“Lila.”

She wipes it away slowly with her foot. We glance around. No one’s there. But still—I feel it. That crawling itch in the back of your neck, like someone’s watching from just out of view.


School is dull, hotter than outside, and dead quiet.

Fire Study is for boys only. Girls go to Form. We kneel on burlap mats in the chapel basement while Pastor Kinnett paces the room with a cane in one hand and a small leather-bound book in the other. He doesn’t limp. The cane isn’t for walking.

He stops in front of Eli Granger.

“Name the Second Flame,” Kinnett says.

Eli hesitates. His lips move, but no sound comes.

“What happens,” the pastor asks, “when the Mother fails to form?”

“Balance breaks,” we murmur.

“Louder.”

“BALANCE BREAKS.”

Kinnett nods and keeps walking.

Later, he sends Eli and me to fetch water from the well. The buckets are heavy, the path cracked. The sun above us is merciless—high and unblinking.

We pass the Remer house on the way. Their windows are covered in white cloth. That’s how you know something’s wrong. Prayer cloth only goes up for mourning or judgment.

At the well, Eli says nothing.

The bucket comes up darker than it should be. Not dirty. Just… off. The water looks thicker somehow. Oily.

We don’t drink it. We pour it out behind the chapel, into the gutter where the ground dips low. It vanishes into the dirt too quickly. Like something underneath is thirsty.

Eli doesn’t speak for the rest of the day.


That night, there’s a bonfire.

No announcement. No warning. You just see the smoke and follow it.

The whole town gathers, dressed in gray. The women and girls wear darker shades. The men hold their hats in their hands. The children stand very still.

At the center is a ring of white stones.

Inside the ring sits a cradle. Wooden. Old. Empty, I think.

Lila grabs my hand. She’s not supposed to, but I don’t let go.

The Bearer arrives last. He’s tall, veiled in red, his face completely hidden. He says nothing. Just raises one arm.

Someone strikes a match.

The cradle bursts into flame.

It happens too fast. The fire’s too big for the kindling. It’s not normal. It’s hungry.

Then Lila steps forward.

She crosses the white stones, kneels beside the cradle, and collapses.

Two women in veils lift her gently and carry her away. She doesn’t move.

No one speaks until the fire dies.


She doesn’t wake until morning.

I bring her water. Her voice is hoarse.

“There’s something in the fire,” she whispers.

“What?”

“It knows your name.”


The bells ring five times the next day.

No one acknowledges the mistake. No one speaks.

We don’t go to school.

Later, four elders walk a boy I’ve never seen down the chapel path. One in front, one behind, one on either side. They don’t speak. When the boy stumbles, they wait. They don’t help.

Lila stands by the fireplace with her arms wrapped around herself. Her face is pale.

“They said your name,” she says. “They said, ‘He burns at thirteen.’”

I’m twelve.


I woke up gasping. My sheets were soaked. My mouth tasted like smoke.

The heat still clung to my skin. I could still hear the bells, faint but real.

I haven’t told anyone this part. Not my parents. Not my friends.

But I think I’m starting to feel it while I’m awake.

My matches are gone from the drawer.

My lighter won’t spark.

And there’s something else I can’t stop thinking about—that cross. If you can even call it a cross. Remembering it now, it wasn’t ours. Ours had Jesus on it.

That one didn’t.

It had no arms. No body. No mercy.

Just four flames—one in each corner.

I asked my mom if she’d ever seen it before. She said no.

Then she told me to stop asking questions.

A little while later, I looked in the mirror. And for half a second—just a flicker—I saw a girl behind me, just out of frame.

She looked like me.

And she was holding a match.
