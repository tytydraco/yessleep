Hey Sis,

I am flying to Miami soon just wanted to let you know I had such a great time this last couple weeks down in Monterrey. The city lights, going hiking, the “whitexican” brunch spots, everything just made me feel like the old days when I… I mean when we used to live there.

As I did the check-in I kept wondering what It would be like to live here again, not just as a visitor but as a permanent resident. My whole life I never felt at home in my hometown and now after years of being outside. I think I truly feel at home back here. There’s just one thing that I can't keep thinking about: Mom.

There’s something about Mom, I mean there’s always something about mom right. But It's not just her, it's my memories of her it's strange. Remember those old tv shows you used to watch? Supernatural, Buffy, Fringe , all those paranormal type shows. They were so scary and realistic when we watched them as kids but looking at them now they just seem bland and outdated. Funny thing is if you try to remember anything about those shows your mind fills in the gaps with distorted, even AI generated looking creatures and scenes. Hmm what I'm trying to say is: That is exactly what happens when I think about Mom I can’t see her.

I can remember your ugly face, my friends, the teachers, everyone that I used to have a connection with back in Monterrey but anytime I want to think about my mom her face is just not there. I just can't see it. I see pitch black nothing, my eyes just can't seem to focus and I look away.

I'm just pretty confused about all this. I was in the city for 3 weeks and we just met once.I know she has this obsession with well you know with “sterile” environments. But shit you would guess if your son was visiting you could make some exceptions. Getting into those suits is expensive you know and the 24 fast is incredibly stupid how would that even affect the air????

And you know what even after all this she still decides to speak through an intercom from a different room? THAT IS NOT NORMAL. Being away for such a long time,  I can't even start to apologize for leaving you all alone with her. I had no idea it was this bad, the last time I saw her before leaving she still was able to be in the same room as me. What happened?? Why didn’t you tell me about this? I thought you visited her last march? That and me not being able to see her face in person again is just so upsetting :( . Please tell me anything you know.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent a little bit before leaving, hope to hear from you soon. Stay away from the Bike Lanes in the city and stay safe.

P.S. Lily and Israel still miss you and they want you to visit them so bad.

Loves you - Your big bro
