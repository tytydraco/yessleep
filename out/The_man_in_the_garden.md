This is from my childhood that I remember and it still terrifies me. This is what I can remember, so I’ve tried to fill in some missing gaps in my memory. But this encounter still lingers in my head. I’ve also put it in a story way to make it more easy to read. This is my first story I’ve wrote, so it may be rough. 

Backstory: When I was around 9-10 years old I was in a friend group. For this story I will call the people in my friend group Sarah, Ava and Nia (Not their real names but for privacy reasons and they don’t want to be named). We were inseparable and when our birthdays would come round we'd have a sleepover at the persons house whose birthday it was, it was a tradition of ours for years when we were in school together. 


It started as the kind of day you don’t question—too good, too simple, too bright. The sort that slips into memory effortlessly, wrapped in laughter and the easy rhythm of friendship.

We were four: me, Sarah, Ava, and Nia. Close enough to finish each other’s sentences and read emotions with a glance. The sleepover had been Sarah’s idea. Her house, tucked at the edge of town, was the kind of place that looked like it belonged in a magazine—stone steps, ivy crawling the sides, and a massive, creaky structure built long before any of us were born. Inside, it was warm and cluttered in a comforting way. Books, half-burned candles, the scent of lavender and old wood.

The living room was enormous, big enough for all of us to claim our own corners, but we chose to pile together on the thick, plush red rug that ran the length of the wooden floor. It was worn, but soft, and when we lay back, we could see the antique ceiling fan spin lazily above us.

The conservatory doors were set just to the right of the TV—tall panes of glass with white-painted frames that swung open into the sunroom. The conservatory was a beautiful room in daylight, full of potted plants, ivy trailing down from hanging baskets, and a white swinging bench that creaked when no one touched it. But at night, it became something else—too still, too quiet, with shadows that didn’t quite sit right. At the far end, a single, large window gave a perfect view of the backyard.

The garden was huge and wild, the grass a little too long, the flowerbeds half-tamed. In the corner stood a chicken coop, freshly built, its wire mesh enclosure holding four clucking, curious hens we had helped pick up that very afternoon.

That’s where the day had begun—with pizza in town, greasy and glorious, and sticky-fingered ice cream that melted down our arms as we sat in the park. Sarah’s parents had taken us to a nearby farm to collect the chickens—a last-minute idea that turned into an unexpected highlight. We argued over names the entire ride back. Peaches was gentle, Biscuit had attitude, Shadow was always off by herself, and Knife—well, Knife pecked like she had a vendetta. Nia named her, of course.

We spent the evening painting—each other, mostly—arms and nails and even streaks of Ava’s hair. Paint stained our hands and socks. We kicked a football in the garden, collapsed on the grass, and watched the clouds shift from cotton-white to bruised purple as the sun went down. At dusk, we wandered to the old wooden bridge in the park, dared each other to cross it in the fading light. When Ava screamed that she saw something move beneath it, we all ran, laughing until our chests hurt.

Back at the house, night fell in a slow hush. Dinner was light and late. We built a nest of blankets and pillows on the living room rug and queued up horror movies (not the scariest movies in the world as we were kids) on Sarah’s ancient DVD player. The flickering light of the screen danced on our faces as we watched the first movie—a silly, campy slasher.

By the third movie, sleep tugged at our limbs. Sarah fell first, curled up with a blanket over her head. Ava followed not long after. Nia and I made it to the end credits, barely, before giving in to the warmth and weight of sleep.

The room was quiet.

The conservatory stood in silence, the garden beyond cloaked in moonlight and shadow.

I don’t know what woke me.

Not a sound. Not a dream. Just that awful, dry-throat thirst that demands attention.

I sat up slowly, blinking in the dark. The TV had gone silent, casting only a faint blue glow. My friends were sprawled across the rug, breathing softly. I stepped over limbs and pillows, moving toward the kitchen.

The tile was cold under my feet. I poured a glass of water and leaned against the counter, letting the stillness settle over me. The house was so quiet, it felt like it had sunk into the earth.

Then I turned back.

And froze.

The conservatory window faced the garden.

And someone was standing in it.

A figure. Still and tall. Just beyond the chicken coop. Not moving. Perfectly centered in the moonlight, like it had always been there.

At first, my brain tried to fight it. My eyes scanned for signs of trickery—a shadow, a branch, something explainable. But this wasn’t something you could mistake.

It was a man.

Or something shaped like one.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

Nothing about him moved. Not even his arms. He didn’t sway. He didn’t shift. Just stood there.

I whispered, “It’s nothing,” and turned away.

My heart raced. I crawled back into my sleeping bag and pulled the blanket up to my chin. I closed my eyes, tried to block it out.

But curiosity—and fear—won out.

I opened my eyes again.

And he was closer.

No longer by the coop. Now halfway across the garden, standing in the open lawn, facing the house directly.

Every part of my body screamed to run—but I couldn’t look away. I sat up, heart hammering, locked in place.

I stared at him for thirty minutes. Maybe more. The room around me didn’t exist anymore—just the garden, the glass, the figure.

Then he stepped forward.

One long, slow stride.

That was when I screamed.

A full, broken scream that shattered the silence.

The others woke in chaos. Sarah shouted, Ava clutched her chest, Nia was already on her knees, searching the shadows for danger.

I pointed to the window.

And they saw him.

The man stood just feet from the conservatory glass now.

He wore black—hood up, coat heavy, gloves, boots. His face was shrouded in darkness. Not shadow—darkness. Like the light refused to touch it.

But it was what he held that turned the moment into a nightmare.

An axe.

Old. Heavy. The blade dull, but thick. He held it low, like he wasn’t in a rush to use it. Like he wanted us to see it.

Ava screamed first. Then Nia. Then all of us.

The man flinched—only slightly.

Then turned.

And walked back into the garden.

Gone.

Just like that.

We moved like survivors of a shipwreck—fumbling, checking locks, closing curtains, stacking chairs against the doors. We didn't talk. We didn’t ask questions. Fear had robbed us of language.

No one slept.

The morning came with a gray sky and birdsong that felt too cheerful.

We gathered at the kitchen table, huddled in silence. None of us touched the toast Sarah’s mom had left. The chickens clucked in the distance, unaware. Peaceful. That felt wrong.

Finally, Nia spoke.

“I had a dream,” she said quietly. “About him. The man. He came to the window. I opened the door, and—he came inside.”

My stomach dropped.

Sarah nodded slowly. “I dreamt the same thing. He walked into the house. I tried to scream, but…”

She trailed off.

Ava said nothing. Just stared at her hands.

But I hadn’t dreamed it.

I was awake.

I remember every detail—the taste of the water, the tile under my feet, the breath fogging in my throat. The silence. The step.

So how could we all have seen the same man? The same axe? The same eyes in the dark?

How could they dream what I lived?

We never talked about it again.

Not at school. Not in group chats. Not at future sleepovers. It was as if that night became a sealed box, buried deep in each of us. And no one wanted to dig it back up.

But I still remember.

And sometimes, when I pass a dark window late at night… I feel like I’m being watched.


The days that followed were the kind you hope will fade into nothing—ordinary, dull, routine. But nothing about that night was ordinary. The memory of the man with the axe haunted the edges of everything I did. The four of us tried to move on, but that quiet terror had slipped inside me like a shadow beneath my skin.

At school, I forced myself to smile and join in, but my mind kept drifting back to that moment when I saw him outside the conservatory window—so close, so impossible. Sarah, Ava, and Nia didn’t talk about it, didn’t mention it. Maybe it was a silent agreement. Maybe they wanted to pretend it never happened. But I couldn’t.

Because after that night, I kept seeing him.

Not full-on. Not standing in plain sight with that horrible axe gleaming. No. It was worse—small things, flickers in the corner of my eye, the kind of subtle presence you can’t shake.

I first noticed it a few days after the sleepover, sitting alone in my room. I caught a flicker of black movement near the far corner where my window met the wall. I turned sharply, heart thudding, but the room was empty. Only the settling dust danced in the stray sunlight.

Then at the grocery store, standing in the cereal aisle, I sensed him there—just a shadow pressed against the end of the aisle. I blinked, and it was gone.

I started avoiding my bedroom window, drawing the curtains tight even in the daytime. But sometimes, when I was lying awake at night, I could swear the faintest silhouette lingered just beyond the glass. Always standing still. Always watching.

It was driving me mad.

I stopped telling my friends. Why add to their fear? Why make this nightmare real for them? Besides, they hadn’t seen him outside their windows. For all they knew, I was losing my mind.

Each night I’d lay in bed, eyes squeezed shut, willing the darkness to stop whispering his name. But the quiet creak of an old swinging bench—the same sound from Sarah’s conservatory—haunted my dreams and bled into waking moments.

Two weeks later, everything came crashing down.

I woke gasping.

The room was cold, colder than usual for early morning. The clock read 4:37 a.m.—too early to be awake and too late to be asleep.

I didn’t want to open my eyes, but something made me. The edges of my vision were darker than they should be, the shadows more solid.

And then, there he was.

Outside my bedroom window.

Closer than I ever imagined possible.

The figure stood beneath the pale light of a streetlamp, black coat hanging heavy, hood hiding his face in an impossible darkness. The axe was in his hand, resting low but catching a faint glimmer of light on its dull blade.

I lay frozen, heart pounding so hard it felt like it might burst from my chest. I didn’t scream. I couldn’t move.

Was I dreaming? Was this some waking nightmare?

I blinked.

He didn’t move.

I blinked again.

And suddenly, he was gone.

Not just turned away or slipped behind a tree, but vanished, as if swallowed by the night itself.

I sat up, trembling, staring at the window long after the streetlamp flickered and died.

I didn’t sleep again that night.

The next day, I barely made it through school. Every shadow seemed to stretch too long. Every whisper of wind through the trees sounded like footsteps following me.

I tried telling Sarah. Just a hint. A tremble in my voice.

But she looked at me like I’d lost something precious—like she didn’t want to hear it.

“It’s probably just stress,” she said softly. “Maybe you’re tired.”

Maybe I was.

But the feeling didn’t go away.

Over the next week, the glimpses continued—always at the edges of my vision, always close to windows or dark corners. Sometimes, I’d catch that same impossible darkness where his face should be.

I stopped sleeping in my room. I moved to the living room couch, surrounded myself with blankets and pillows, keeping every light on all night.

One evening, while sitting near the window, I thought I heard a soft creak—the sound of that swinging bench from Sarah’s conservatory.

I froze.

The air grew heavy.

And I could swear I saw the faintest breath fog up the glass.

But when I reached to pull the curtain aside, nothing was there.

No footsteps in the grass. No shadow in the trees.

Just silence.

The isolation grew.

I stopped answering calls. I avoided texts. My friends tried to reach me, but their voices felt distant—like they were calling through a thick wall I couldn’t climb.

At school, I noticed others staring at me sometimes. Whispers I couldn’t hear but felt. As if my fear had painted a target on me.

One night, exhausted and desperate, I found myself scrolling through forums online—people sharing stories of shadows that stalk, figures that watch. Others who swear they’ve seen something no one else believes.

It didn’t help.

Because no matter how many stories I read, mine felt more real. More immediate. Like he wasn’t just a ghost or a hallucination, but something waiting—for me.

And then came the nightmares.

Not dreams but waking visions—snapshots of that night, over and over. The axe glinting in the moonlight. The cold silence. The way his darkness swallowed the garden whole.

Every night, I’d wake soaked in sweat, hearing that awful creak echo in my ears.

I wanted to scream. To run. To hide.

But I stayed silent.

Because the last thing I saw that morning at my window was the end of it.

He never came back.

No more silhouettes.

No more breath on glass.

No more axe in the dark.

But sometimes, in the stillness of my room, I hear the faint creak of a swinging bench.

And when I do, I close my eyes.

Because I know the garden is still watching.

And maybe, so is he.
