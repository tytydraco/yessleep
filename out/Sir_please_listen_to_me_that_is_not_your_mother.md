My name is Shu am a 17 year old Filipino living with my little sister and mother in Saudi Arabia.
Ever since 4 years ago when we moved to this fairly old apartment complex that's like a 10 minute walk from the busy streets, i'ved learn a few bits of arabic from talking to friends at school even tho we speak English all the time.

 It was around a year ago were things started getting strange, my little sister who is 6 started to coming to me allot more, i found it weird because she never really left my mom for less than a minute, but maybe she really wanted to spend more time with me which i found it cute, my mom started to be stricter in the house hold which i find it weird since my mom is never strict and would most likely give us a reason why but this time she didn't, 

She gave us rules to follow from now on
1. Don't answer the phone
2. Phones are unlocked and are given to her at 5pm
3. We would no sleep im different rooms
4. Sleep before 9pm

These are totally weird but i would never argue with my mom so i just listened to her but lately my little sister would not leave my side she looks worried and the phone has been ringing allot but never we never answer it since my mom told me not to. 
It was one night where my mom was really angry for some reason and answered the phone, she told me to come and speak to the man on the phone since i can hold a conversation in Arabic, but what bothered me is why does my mom want me to answer the phone she always handles these situations ever since we came here. 

Phone call:
Caller: peace upon you brother

Me: may peace upon you too

Me: is there any problem sir? 

Caller: are you Shu [redacted] 

Me: y-yes thats me may i ask why

Caller: are you with your little sister right now
 
Me: yes, excuse me may i ask who i calling right now

Caller: we are from the Police station on the report of a kidnapping suspect 

Me: sir who made the report, i don't understand.

Caller: Your mother sir, whose currently in the station we have been trying to contact you for months. 

Me: nonsense my mom is right here

*i turn to my mom and she looked jittery, off and looked like she couldn't understand what i was saying*

Thats when i heared 

*Sir please listen to me thats not your mother*

My heart sank and dread came to me in an instant i took a closer look at my mom. She doesn't look like that who have we been living with for the past year. 

Caller: sir hello are you there, we are sending police officers. Do you still live at [redacted] 

Me: yes please hurry, she doesn't understand what im saying but ill end the call here. 

Caller: avoid anything unnecessary that might raie suspicion. And stay safe well be there in 20 minutes 

[Call Ended] 

I looked at her and thats when i noticed shes holding my little sister a little too tight and my little sister looked like she was holding back tears

Said can i sleep with my little sister tonight they asked me about school and im kind of stressed out by it. 

She agreed and said

On one condition
