 About 6 months ago my ex and I broke up so I had to move back in with my mom (I'm 23) and I've been living with her since then, about a month ago I broke my collarbone in a longboarding accident so I've been out of work and at home most of the time because I'm not really supposed to be doing anything.

My mom is a busy woman, she works hard but sometimes has to travel for her job, this week is one of those weeks, she asked me to take care of the house while she's gone, I told her I would. She was supposed to be back last night late, her flight was supposed to land at 10pm-ish. So around 11:30pm I hear the front door open and close and my mom go into her room and shut the door, (her room is on the first floor next to the kitchen) a little offended she didn't come say hi or goodnight or anything, but I figured she was tired and she just forgot, decided I'll just give her shit for it in the morning.

I play my games for like 20 more minutes before I decide I'm tired and want to go get water before bed, I walk downstairs and it's pitch black down there, I walk into the darkness as the kitchen is right next to the stairs and I'll get light when I open the fridge, I walk past my mom's room to get to the kitchen and notice the door is open, I know for a fact I heard her close it and I did not hear it open again. Whatever though, probably just tired. Then I hear something move in there and I realize my mom must still be awake so I say "Not even a hello Ajay, just straight to your room? I'm hurt" she didn't say anything back. I thought she might still be sleeping and just shifted in bed so I went to the fridge and started getting my water and from behind me, from her room I hear "Ajay" I yell back "what's up?" no response, so I walk over to her room, keep in mind it's pitch black after I closed the fridge. I get to the start of the small hall that leads to my moms room, and say "what?" no response again, so this time I turn on the hall light and as the light, floods the hall I see she's standing in her doorway with an unnaturally wide smile on her face

I say "what the fuck mom, you scared me are you good dude?" she didn't say anything, just waved at me to come closer, I froze, I just told "her" that I'm going to bed and that I love her, I didn't turn my back though I backed up to the stairs, and as I get to the base of the stairs the hall light turns off and I'm surrounded in the darkness again, at this point, I'm scared out of my mind, I hit every light switch near me and turn on every light in the living room, nothing. I bolted upstairs, grabbed the keys to my car and threw some clothes in my backpack which was all a struggle as I have one arm in a sling, I notice my phone on my desk grab it and see I have a text from my mom, explaining how she and her coworkers decided to stay another day to have fun where they were and not just work and will be getting on a flight the day after tomorrow and how she wanted to tell me sooner but hasn't had service all day. Yup that tracks. I put my phone in my pocket, grab my bag and keys, walk out of my room and realize all the lights are back off, hell no I think to myself as I pull out my phone and turn the flashlight on. 

"I just gotta make it there, unlock the door and leave, I've already remote started my car, I hear it running its a loud ass charger, I'll be ok if I can just make it across the street" I tell myself.

I walk with my phone in hand, down the stairs, the phones light sucks it doesn't even reach to the bottom of the steps. as I get closer to the bottom other steps start getting revealed until I see the floor...with my mom standing at the bottom of them, I look up and my eyes meet hers, she's looking at me and smiling still. she backs off into the dark with a wave. I'm still standing in the middle of my stair case, no where near a light switch when my phone lights up with a notification..."low battery, turn on power saving mode?" then my phone fully dies and I'm surrounded in darkness again.

"You are so fucking kidding me right?" I think to myself.

I stand there in the darkness, just listening, the silence is almost deafening, I don't hear anything, if I make a run for it I know this house well enough I don't need light right? I run and miss a step at the bottom, I fell right onto the shoulder with the broken collarbone, laying on the floor in immense pain I roll onto my back and begin to listen again as the pain subsides. Still nothing, I gotta get up and go, then again from the kitchen which is maybe 20 feet to my left...."Ajay" and then I hear bare footsteps on the tile start walking slower, getting faster, almost in a run now coming right for me. pure adrenaline goes through my body and I get up and run out the front door and across the street into my car. 

I get to my car and sit there for a while, waiting for my phone to get enough charge, when it does, I call my friend Hayley and ask if I can come over and she jokingly asks "and why would a boy like you want to come over this late huh?"

"Nothing like that I swear I just can't be in my house right now" I say.

She notices the seriousness in my voice "Yeah you can come over"

"Thank you see you soon"

Everything from here on out, is not important except for I convinced Hayley to stay with me at my house for the next two days until my mom actually gets home since I did give her my word I'd watch the house. When we got to my place, we started watching TV and she fell asleep on my bed and I couldn't sleep so I kept watching TV, and decided I may feel better writing this here, but as I'm finishing this up I think I heard someone lightly knock on my door and the light in the hallway is off now when we definitely left it on.
