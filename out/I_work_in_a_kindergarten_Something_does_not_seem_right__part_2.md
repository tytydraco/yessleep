So the last story I told about my workplace you heard about the "bald man". I have done some digging about that entity but I’m not yet ready to tell about it, got to do some more work first, but I did figure something out about this kindergartens founding. It seems like the kindergarten I work as was used as a base under WW2 for the rebels here in Norway, and it seems like they were found out. What happened there is not clear, but I’m reading a ton of papers about it so some more info might show up soon.

  
But today I’m here to tell you about a weird happening from one of our weekly trips into the "Ekorn skogen" or Squirrel forest. Once a week, (or more if I can help it) we travel outside the kindergarten to go on a trip. This is not only for the kids, but for us adults as well. The kids get to learn to walk calmly on the sidewalk, they get to learn about nature and other things, and they get some fresh air and new surroundings. We adults get a break from the monotony of being in the kindergarten the whole time, some fresh air as well and we escape the feeling of being constantly being under watch.

  
often when we go on such trips we light a fire, grill some sausages or sandwiches, but this time we put out all the stops. we brought one of the few storm kitchens we have, with propane and all. the plan was to make pancakes and some hot cocoa for the kids as an extra little "yay, fun". we do this sometimes just to spoil them, for yes, these kids are not our own kids but we get attached and we love your kids just as much as you do.

  
its truly a weird profession we have. you have the angry moments where the kids fight and when you talk to them they only smile and you know they don’t care about what has happened. you have the fun moments when the kids say something unexpected and fun, and you have the bittersweet moments, when the kids quit, since they are going to school. that’s when the parents as well as the kids cry (and us too sometimes, we just have to hide it)

  
anyway, this trip was supposed to be perfect. we got to the Squirrel forest without issues, which isn’t that rare. the snow was laying fresh on the ground, the sun was shining. it was a perfect, a truly perfect day for taking a fun trip.

  
now for some facts about the woods. they are old, and well taken care of. a lot of people go here on the weekends, or with their dogs or just for a romantic, peaceful walk. there is something magical about the woods on days like these. one of the fantastic things is that its arrayed such that, when you enter the woods it blocks all the sounds from outside. Its like, gone. yes you can still hear the cars and the hustle and bustle from the surroundings, but they are heavily muted. as through a thick window or door.

  
this day as well we had an extra kid with us. since it was supposed to be the whole department (still not sure if that’s the right word, but I’m going to keep using it) of 25 kids were going, all the adults also went, which meant, I got the heavy backpack (yay for being the only man in the group). and today a extra kid was going to join. the reason for that is because, their family had recently moved here and were looking for a kindergarten to join. now you must know, it is highly irregular for kids that have just joined the kindergarten to join on a trip. its since they are new they are often really unsure about their surroundings. they don’t have that many friends if even one, and they don’t know or trust us. But this kid have kind of just slid in and over the course of a week, become so ingrained in the department that we deemed it safe. we adults were really looking forward to this trip alright.

  
about this kid, I cant tell you a lot since its against the law, but its kind of crucial for the story. she has almost white blonde hair down to her stomach, and almost grey eyes. if that kid does not grow up to become a model of some sort I am going to eat my outdoor clothes. the only thing about her is that she doesn’t seem to have a lot of emotions. yes she does smile and such but not often. way less than a "regular" kid. so if you remember my first story she is more of a group 2 sometimes group 3 category.group 2 are the "adult" children who can sometimes "control" the other kids since they are oftentimes smarter and more cunning. whilst group 3 are the silent calm ones. this kid was something in between. a really lovely girl though. warm smile when she found something funny and really took good care of the younger kids. kind.

  
back to the day at hand. we were walking throughout the woods towards our destination. which is a small lean to, that I and some of the other guys at work constructed a summer. In the kindergarten we are 3 other guys so I’m not all alone here. but that was our destination. the lean to itself is constructed in a small clearing together with some rope swings, a small tree house we constructed together with the kids a few years back and a fire pit. and there are a lot of small places to hide and have fun or to sneak around and throw snowballs at each other.I am the first to arrive, and what I see is that someone have been here before us. not unusual really, the woods are public property and everyone can go here as long as you don’t wreck things. footprints all around the camp, but that’s about it. honestly, I hate it when this happens, not because I don’t want others to use the place but its because the city have its problems with drug users and alcoholics. which a regular town has I assume. so when there have been in clear use I need to check if there are needles or beer cans, or joints and so on, that I need to remove before the kids find them and potentially hurt themself on it. now the kids are getting older and smarter and I have told them several times to tell me if they find something like this. to never, ever, ever, pick it up themself.

  
luckily I find nothing, and the trip resumes. we set up the kitchen, which the 3 older women do before while they drink their coffee and discuss things while I and the other younger colleague start to mess about and play with the kids. snowball fights, hide and seek, making snowmen and snowwomen are on the agenda. we have a lot of fun until one of the older ladies yell that the food is ready. we make our way towards the lean to, make the kids sit down, wipe their hands with anti - bacterial wipes before we hand them a warm cup of cocoa and a pancake to feast upon.

  
and here is some of the perks of the job. I get pancakes as well. I get myself a cup of coffee before we sing our lunch song which is called "pulverheksa" or in English "the powderwitch". we eat and have a good time just relaxing. after a little while we start to play again in the snow. But at this time the kids start to get a little tired so the playing is calmed down.that’s when I feel I need to pee. For me that is easy, just go to a secluded spot, zip down my warm overalls (which is kind of like a ski suit?) and just go ahead. I often need to tell the kids that I am going to the toilet or else they would follow after me and I don’t want them to go home and tell their parents "today I saw (my name)s penis". that would ruin my life, put me behind bars and make it so I will never get a job every again.

  
I tell the kids "il be right back" then I walk not far of to a secluded spot with a lot of bushes nearby. as I let loose I notice something weird. the sounds have stopped. the birds have stopped making noise, the cars surroundings have stopped and weirdest of all, the kids are silent. now kids being silent is incredibly suspicious so I turn my head but I don’t see any of them. shrugging, I continue my business. I’m just about finished when I hear it. the breaking of branches.  
before I can do something out of the woods comes a man. not a big man mind you but a drug addled man. unkempt hair, unkempt beard, old ragged clothes that are not for this season at all. He is obviously high as a kite and in one of his arms he holds a needle. used. as his blood is still on it. he sees me, and I see him and we both freeze. I still have my dick in hand and the second I start to fumble to get it back in my pants he starts to move as well. with cocaine in his blood and rage in his eyes he starts to advance on me. I get my member inside my pants before he comes close and am about to try to calm this dude down.

  
now, I’m not a small guy, I’m about 180 and have been dappling with some martial arts, but still a used needle and disease still scares me. just as he was about to come within striking distance something extremely weird happens. he pauses. he looks past me, and I have never ever seen a man, drug addled or not, pale that fast before. his skin instantly turns the shade of the same snow around us and he opens his mouth before mumbling. "Nei, nei, ikke du, jeg har ikke gjort noe galt jeg sverger, tilgi meg". which translates to "No, no, not you, I haven’t done anything wrong, I swear, forgive me". before yelling "forgive me!!" and running into the woods again.I look behind me, somewhat in terror myself before seeing...the new child. her grey eyes is staring at me. I stare at her before she says in the most innocent voice, "I was looking for you. the snowman is done", she turns around and goes back.

  
I am flabbergasted. I don’t know what in the hell just happened but I calmly collect myself before walking back with her, get the rest of the ladies to pack together asap and walk back. I hurriedly tell the rest of the employees what I have seen, that a drug user is here and we should go back now. the women have already packed together everything by then so its mostly a issue of gathering the kids and walking back. naturally I was talking with her the rest of the way to see if I could glean anything from her about what had happened. but she doesn’t seem to be remembering anything except that we didn’t finish her snowman. but I promised her we will finish it another day. "we will" she said.

  
when we come back to the kindergarten I immediately go to the chief, and tell her what has happened leaving out the kid ( who would believe me anyway) instead opting to say that he advanced but stopped and turned around for no apparent reason. there was no foul happened so I just get the message to call the cops and tell them that there is a drug user in the woods with a needle so they should check that out. which they said they would.now as if that was not enough. a couple of days later the newspaper told a story about a man found dead not far from the woods. a drug user that had apparently overdosed and died. if its the same man, i still dont know, but its too much of a coincidance.

  
but one thing is for sure, and that is that the face of terror that man had from seeing that child will forever haunt me.
