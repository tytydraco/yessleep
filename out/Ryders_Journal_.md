This is documenting my experiences, as I feel the world should know, in case anything happens to me.

A few weeks ago a new art gallery opened in my town. Which isn't unusual for my town, but what is unusual is the multiple murder suicides that had happen a few days after the art gallery opened.  

After those, it got shut down but reopened a week after, and on the very first day the art gallery reopened, the murders started again. 

The main attraction had been that of a portrait, I personally have not seen it, but my friend had gone to see it recently. It is that of a girl who looks to be in her early twenties, standing alone on a hill. In one version there appears to be something behind her, some of those who say they saw it called it a "monster", while others claim there was nothing and they just imagined it.

My friend was quick to shut down the rumors, claiming there wasn't a monster, just that a portion of the picture had been faded by weather, hence the "monster", and the rest had either been blocked by shadows cast by the trees or had faded away as well.

Nonetheless, my friend didn't seem to give off anything that would signal a break in his mental health, other than having a coughing fit after explaining things. I felt that he was hiding something from me.

That night, I couldn't shake the uneasy feeling my friend's explanation had left me with. The coughing fit seemed too convenient, too abrupt like something had caught in his throat the moment he started talking about the shadows in the painting.

I decided to do some research on the gallery's history. The building itself had been vacant for years before this new exhibition, and oddly enough, I couldn't find any information about the current owners. Every search led to dead ends and disconnected phone numbers. Even more disturbing was what I discovered about the painting itself: no one seemed to know the artist's name, or where the piece had originated from.

Local social media was filled with conflicting accounts. Some claimed the girl in the portrait had different colored eyes depending on the time of day, while others swore they'd seen her hands move ever so slightly. One post caught my attention, a woman describing how her husband had visited the gallery three days ago and hadn't been the same since. He'd started sleeping with his eyes open, she wrote, and would sometimes speak in a voice that wasn't his own.

All these stories only served to feed my paranoia, yet something in me yearned for more. After hours of searching I eventually found an obscure video taken a few nights ago. The angle made it impossible to see the face of the person who'd taken the footage, only their shoes.

The person zooms in on the gallery's back window. At first glance it seems normal; nothing seems out of the ordinary.

I move forward in the video and suddenly there's movement coming from the bushes outside. My hand stops.

There was someone hanging from a tree in the background, and looking closer, you could make out their hair, their clothes. But I knew immediately that they weren't human. It had a twisted, misshapen body, with too many fingers on each of its three hands. Its head was huge compared to its body, like it was made of clay that hadn't been thoroughly shaped and now was molded into a sphere.

The video ended abruptly. I sat back in my chair, a cold sweat creeping along my skin. What did I just witness? Was it fake? Could it really have been real? Or perhaps this was a prank set up by the people in my town, but that wouldn't explain the murders, so many dead people couldn't possibly be part of a ruse. But the thought that something genuinely paranormal was involved was equally unbearable.

So what do I do? Go to the police? They probably know just as much as I do, it would be no help to go to the police.

I don't know what to do.

My friend is acting weird, I got a call from him around one this morning. Though it was just screaming over and over again

It lasted for around ten minutes before I couldn't take it anymore and hung up on him. It only took a second of it for it to wake me up and keep me up for hours afterward, not like I've slept great ever since everything in this town has started.

It didn't sound like him but I doubt anyone would have pretended to scream for that long. I think I'm going to go and visit him later today, make sure he's doing okay. 

11/17/2022, later in the day

He was pronounced dead a couple hours ago, along with his girlfriend.

Found by his mother.

He broke his girlfriend's neck while she was sleeping, and then hung herself shortly after. There was an unnatural amount of blood from his nose and ears,

Not only was this terrifying for his mother and family, it also reminded me of a comment he'd made not long ago.

'You know I used to never believe in paranormal activity. Well now it's all I think about.'

Maybe he couldn't take the constant paranoia or thoughts that haunted him in his sleep, or maybe something had possessed him, and didn't have much luck escaping while still inside it.

I think I need to go see that painting for myself. I need to know what's going on.

I tried looking into the artist of that painting, and nothing. Literally nothing came up, as if that person was made up entirely, which, honestly, wouldn't surprise me at this point, especially with all of the research I had put into this already

11/18/2022

I'm writing this from my car, parked across the street from the gallery. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold the pen. I've been sitting here for two hours, watching people walk in and out. Something's not right about the way they move when they leave, it's mechanical, like they're being pulled by invisible strings.

The sun is setting now, casting long shadows across the building's facade. The painting is visible through the front window, illuminated by track lighting that seems unnecessarily bright. Even from here, I can see the girl's face. She shouldn't be visible from this angle, but somehow, she's staring directly at me.I've noticed something else too. Every person who's gone in alone hasn't come out. Groups walk out together, but individuals... they just disappear. I've been keeping count. Seven people have entered by themselves since I've been here. None have left.

My phone keeps glitching. The screen flickers with strange symbols I've never seen before, and there's this high-pitched ringing that comes and goes. The battery is draining unusually fast, even though it's not being used. It reminds me of what happened to my friend's phone before...

I should leave. Every rational part of my brain is screaming at me to start the engine and drive as far away from here as possible. But I can't. Because now I understand what my friend meant about paranormal activity becoming all-consuming. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. Once you know, you can't unknow.

The gallery closes in thirty minutes. I've made up my mind.

I'm going in.

11/19/2022

I'm back home.

I don't know how long I've been sitting here staring at my hands. They look normal, but they don't feel like mine anymore. Nothing feels right since I saw it.

The gallery was empty when I walked in, no staff, no other visitors, just the quiet hum of the track lighting and my footsteps echoing off the polished floor. The painting... God, the painting. Photos couldn't capture what it really is. The girl's eyes followed me, but that wasn't the worst part. The longer I looked, the more I realized the background wasn't painted at all, it was moving, shifting like smoke underwater. And the frame... the frame seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat.I must have stood there for hours, or maybe it was minutes. Time doesn't make sense anymore. I remember reaching out to touch it, my fingers just inches from the canvas, when the lights went out. In the darkness, I heard breathing that wasn't my own, and something cold brushed against the back of my neck.

The next thing I knew, I was in my car, parked in my driveway. My clothes were soaked with sweat, and there was dried blood under my fingernails. I have no memory of driving home.

The worst part is, I can still feel her watching me. Even now, with my curtains drawn and every light in the house on, I know she's here. Sometimes, out of the corner of my eye, I catch glimpses of that shifting background seeping through my walls.

My phone won't turn on anymore. The clock on my microwave is showing symbols instead of numbers. And the mirrors... I had to cover all the mirrors. What I saw in them wasn't me. Not anymore.

I need to warn people about that gallery, about that painting. But how can I when my hands shake every time I try to type, when my voice fails every time I try to speak about it? Maybe that's why there's no information about the artist online. Maybe everyone who's tried to expose the truth has...

Something's scratching at my bedroom door.

I can hear her humming.

She spoke to me while I was asleep last night. Her voice echoed in my ears, drowning out my thoughts, suffocating me with a single whispered word:

wakeupwakeupwakeup——youarelosendiallinesarebreaking—everyoanyoneeverythingisincompatiblewiththisplaceyouallneedtogo

go

——G0———

 go

The world's incompatible with us. There's something not quite right here, not quite normal, but that might be exactly what's causing all of the oddities.

I also found a note under my door,

freeyoursisterforyoursoulandmind

I don't want her.

I didn't write this,

it's not in my handwriting

she wants out, and if she does come out then we're fucked

fucking fucked

I need to help her

I need to free her

11/21/22

The walls are breathing.

I tried to leave the house today, but the doors... they don't lead where they're supposed to anymore. The front door opened to my bedroom. The back door showed me the gallery again, that cursed gallery, but when I slammed it shut and opened it again, it was just my kitchen, twisted somehow, everything slightly wrong. The faucet drips upward. The shadows fall in impossible directions.

My sister called. At least, the caller ID said it was her, but the voice... Christ, the voice. It spoke in frequencies that made my teeth ache, that made my eyes water with colors I've never seen before. "You know what you have to do," it said, over and over, until the phone melted in my hand, leaving stigmata-like burns on my palm in the shape of her face

The note from yesterday keeps changing. Every time I look at it, the words rearrange themselves:

mindandsoulyourforsissterfreeyouryourmindandsoulforfreeyoursistersisterfreeyourmindforyoursoul

I think I understand now.

There's a new mirror in my hallway. I didn't put it there. I can't cover it up, the sheets keep sliding off, like oil on water. In it, I see her standing behind me, but when I turn around, she's in the mirror again. Her smile is too wide. Her teeth are all wrong.

My handwriting is changing. The letters want to curl into spirals, into symbols I somehow understand but wish I didn't. They're telling me secrets about the spaces between spaces, about the thin membrane between what is and what should never be.

She's getting closer.

I think I'm running out of time to choose.

Sister or soul.

Soul or sister.

Sister and soul and sister and soul and

I need to kill my sister

Hello,

This is Ryder's mother, I had found this journal when we were cleaning his apartment. I feel there is a need to finish his story, put an explanation to the words he had written. Though I doubt anyone will read this, for my own sanity, I need to explain.

The police report says they found Sophie first. My beautiful daughter, her throat slit while she was asleep. And Ryder, Ryder was found with a plastic bag tied around his head, a few feet away from her bed. Her apartment was broken into, there was no signs of foul play, so the police closed the case not too long after the funeral. Official report states it was just another murder suicide.

Ryder's apartment was clean, and normal, despite everything he wrote in this journal. 

I feel like I need to go see the painting, see what he was talking about
