Charlie was a pretty strange kid. I mean, not because he was a loner, or because he had absolutely no friends, but because there was something a little off about him. You see, Charlie ate worms, and I don’t mean like the kid who would pluck one out of the ground and slurp it down to gross everyone out for their own amusement. No, Charlie wasn’t like that. Most kids would say they were afraid to even get near him because they might smell the worm guts on his breath.

Charlie always ate lunch by himself. I remember watching him dig out his thermos and the normal food, you’ll know what I mean by ‘normal’, but the one thing he cherished lay covered in a plastic bowl. He popped the lid off with a big, hungry smile on his face that was so big it lifted his glasses up his face, he dug through the dirt inside the bowl and found a big, plump and juicy worm that he then slurped into his mouth like it was spaghetti. The worm wriggled for dear life as it was sucked into his disgusting orifice. More than once, this little show made a nearby kid hurl all over the floor, prompting a grumpy old janitor to throw sawdust and clean it up with resentment at the weird worm kid.

There were rumors going around the school that Charlie had been tested by various doctors at various hospitals. Some kids thought maybe he was psychotic, and the religious kids concluded that he was possessed. According to the rumors, the doctors concluded that he had pica, which is a disorder where people crave things they wouldn’t normally want, like rocks, lotion… or even worms. Some friends of mine claimed that their parents knew Charlie’s parents, and their parents had said that Charlie was put on various supplements and vitamins, but he still wanted worms. His cravings were insatiable, to the point of addiction.

The school administrators, as grossed out as they were, could do little to Charlie. My friends said that his parents had been infuriated when the principal had made Charlie eat in a room by himself, saying that they were discriminating against poor Charlie because he had an odd craving for snacks. His parents were threatening to get lawyers involved if they didn’t treat Charlie as an equal to the rest of us. Much to our dismay, we had to watch Charlie, from the corner of our eyes, as he dined on his wormy delicacy with the giggling ecstasy as if it were candy.

I believe the following events happened around Christmas of our fifth grade year. One thing that I remember is that it was snowing and Charlie was dining on less and less worms due to frigid weather. My dad had become acquainted with Charlie’s dad through his job, and so, they had arranged a playdate. I fought with my parents about it, to the point that they were threatening to ground me if I didn’t go.

I remember thinking, “God I hope the other kids don’t find out.”

Sure enough, they did somehow. I’m going to assume that my parents told some other kids’ parents.

“Brody is a worm eater too!”

“Hey worm eater, how many worms did ya eat today?”

“If you need something to snack on, ask Charlie!”

“Do you have a hard time brushing the worm guts out of your teeth or do you even bother?”

“I think I see the worm guts stuck between his teeth! Ewwwwww!”

Ya know, typical immature grade school verbal annihilations like that. I would go home and cry, wondering how my parents could be so cruel. I would wonder what I had done to deserve such a punishment. Was this karma for all the times I had made fun of him? All the times I had rooted kids on while they barfed all over the beaten up hardwood floors of the cafeteria after seeing Charlie woof down a few wiggling treats?

The fateful day had come and I agonizingly climbed into the car, trying to mentally prepare myself for the horror of what I might see as we drove to his house. To my surprise, it actually appeared quite normal. The house was a white split level with a driveway that had two parked sedans – pretty much like every other home in the area. Nothing appeared menacing about it on the outside, and it calmed my nerves a bit.

“Charlie’s in the kitchen eating some lunch,” his mom said, pointing to where that was.

“Oh great,” I thought, “I’m gonna have an up-close view of him chowing down on worms.” My stomach rolled and heaved, it took all I had to hold down the acidic vomit trying to force its way out of my esophagus.

I slowly, and I mean as slow as a slug, walked toward the kitchen. To be on the safe side, I paused to look around the corner before I stepped even a foot in. To my surprise, he was eating a salad and a sandwich, with a glass of orange juice. I recall thoughts racing through my head as I was trying to conclude what was really going on. I thought that maybe he was really eating worms for attention after all, maybe it was a desperate cry for some sort of human contact, and maybe he was just a really lonely little weird kid.

“Uh, hi, Charlie,” I said nervously as I approached a chair to sit down. I pulled the chair out with caution, just in case of a sudden movement toward a plastic bowl he might've hidden somewhere for dessert. I said to myself, that if he did, I was going to peace out like a bullet.

He chewed his leafy salad, not looking up at me for several moments, but eventually his eyes moved up to mine.

“Hi,” he said through a crunch.

I paused, thinking of what to even say in such an awkward moment. I finally went for a very 90s thing to say. “Do you have a Super Nintendo?”

He nodded.

“Well, I brought some of my games if you want to play them with me.”

He nodded again as he crunched more salad.

I can’t recall what I said but I tried to make more idle talk with him but he just didn’t respond. He just kept eating his food. I wished my dad hadn’t left because the awkwardness made me want to just flee even more.

Finally, he finished his lunch and pushed himself from the table.

“Let’s go to my room and play some games.”

I felt relief when he finally said something, and it was normal, but now I began to wonder what his room was like. Was it filled from floor to ceiling with his slimy, red snacks? Was the floor maybe covered in dirt, filled with the worms? We went down the hall where I walked into a pretty normal mid-90s boys bedroom – Power Rangers posters on the wall, a fat TV sitting on a tiny table with a Super Nintendo on the floor, action figures scattered in random places, a bunk bed used by just one kid. I noticed too that his room didn’t smell bad or appear all that gross. A feeling of regret came over me that maybe I had been wrong about Charlie all along and that maybe I should apologize at some point.
“Last year, for my birthday, I asked my parents for a bunk bed for me and a friend to have sleepovers. You’re the first to ever hang out with me.”

That made me feel good but also bad for all the times I had mocked him and acted horribly toward him, for all the rude nicknames, and for alienating him with our cruelty.

We had been playing games for probably an hour, when he paused the game to stand up and stretch.

“Let’s go to the basement. I have something cool to show you.”

Intrigued, I followed him. I wonder if this was where his parents had a full blown arcade, one that was free and you could play as much as you wanted? I had these crazy, unrealistic ideas that only a child could have. My God, was I in for a shock.

The basement was dark, except for a few dimly lit halogen lights that hung above three large boxes filled with dirt. They were about four feet wide, eight feet long, and four feet high.

“This is where my beauties grow and live.”

It took me a few moments, but realization kicked in. He was talking about worms, and boy, do you want to talk about a holy shit moment. Every nerve in my body shuttered and I felt ice cold. My gut churned, threatening to release everything I had eaten that day, but somehow, I managed to suppress it.

I tried to stop myself from walking but my legs kept going. I didn’t want to go any further and I’m not sure why I did. Was it pure curiosity? Was it the urge to have some questions answered? Or was I just that stupid? I honestly think it was a little of all those. Curiosity is a very strong force.

The basement smelled of earth and something else that I couldn’t quite place. It reminded me of a time  when I had found a dead deer by the side of a road and it had appeared to have been laying there for days, its belly had burst open from the trapped necrotic gasses that needed to escape. This smell was like that but fainter.

I looked over into one of the bins and saw ordinary looking soil.

“These are the beds where my babies grow,” he said as he reached for something underneath it. “And this is what I feed them.”

In his hand was a bucket filled with vegetable scraps. He evenly spread them out across the dirt with gentle care.

“But sometimes, they deserve a snack as well.”
	
Charlie walked over to a shelf and removed a plastic cooler, the type you would take on a picnic. He popped open the lid, to reveal a stench like the one I had been smelling. This is part of the story that is difficult to write and I had to take a few moments before doing so. Here goes.

From the cooler, he pulled out a partially dismembered cat. Its head and back legs were missing, but the rest was there. It was rigid from rigor mortis and had obviously decomposed partially as well. Charlie laid the animal corpse on another shelf, where he produced a large chopping knife and whacked off one of the legs with a swift strike. I was mortified. I had no idea what he was going to do with it, but I was even more scared that I was about to find out.

“Ya know, Brody. You really are the first to come here. I’ve tried and tried the last few months. My parents work with lots of other parents from school and none of them had the backbone to make their kid come over here. Except yours did.”

Charlie then walked over to the left worm bed and laid it down with the same careful way as he had the vegetables. This time though, the worms popped from the earth with a frenzied eagerness that I didn’t even know worms could do. They wriggled and crawled on the corpse with surprising speed, breaking down the leg to bone within a few minutes, then a few more minutes later, the bone was gone as well.

“I trained them myself, ya know. I bred them specifically for this. When you saw me eating them, I wasn’t eating them for the taste. No. I was eating them so I could understand them. I thought that if I ate them, then I could become like them,” he began giggling erratically, “You see, Brody. I don’t want to be friends with you or anyone else. In fact, I hate you. You see, I brought you here to start training them for something… new. I thought, why not feed them one of the worst people in the world?”

I think that was when he hit me with the flat end of the chopping knife, because the next thing I can remember is waking up to a shocking explosion of pain. I was tied up to an old kitchen chair, my mouth gagged with a rag and sealed with duct tape. My body instantly screamed out in pain, but was muffled by his improvisation. I couldn’t pinpoint the pain immediately and began scanning myself for the source. 

The warmth of my blood told me immediately where the pain was originating. My right index finger was gone, blood squirting with every heartbeat from the stub that remained. I looked up and saw him place the finger in another worm bed and the worms eagerly devoured my severed appendage.

“This is the finger that you used to point and laugh at me! You’d call me those awful names! You’d urge other kids to puke at the sight of me! You would point and tell other kids how much you thought my breath stank of worms! Now, you won’t be able to point and laugh at me anymore! I’m going to chop you up, piece by piece and feed you to my children!”

I struggled to free myself, but Charlie had bound my arms and legs with so much duct tape that I just couldn’t budge. Screaming proved to be futile as well but I tried like hell. The chair rocked slightly as I attempted to free myself, but Charlie just laughed and laughed.

He started walking toward me, playing with the knife in his hand.
“Time for the next finger, Brody. My children are so, so hungry.”

Another sickening chop, another explosive burst of pain as he chopped off my middle finger and halfway chopped off the next one. He stood by and watched me cry and writhe in agony. I couldn’t see from the flood of tears constantly pouring from my eyes, but I also didn’t want to witness another finger being fed to those sickening things.

Then, I guess, God decided to have mercy on me. I think it was my tears and snot that loosened the duct tape around my mouth. I screamed for the heavens, Charlie turning around sharply, urging me to shut up. His mother raced down stairs, and when she saw what was going on, she too screamed.

Charlie was all over the news for weeks after. They talked about the kid who had murdered countless pets and had been feeding them to his worm farm, then tried to do the same with a classmate. He was even interviewed once and he told the interviewer “He was the first. There were lots more that were on the menu” as he laughed.

I was eventually able to get prosthetic fingers a few years ago and I can type with them as you can tell. My life has been pretty normal since. I had to see a therapist for a few years, but there’s nothing majorly wrong with me, other than my horrific fear of worms. I can’t even fish with live bait, I always use lures or imitation bait. I can’t even stand to see them if I move something in my yard. It just makes me want to vomit.

The reason that I decided to write this is because Charlie was recently featured on a popular television series about psychotic family members. His parents starred in it, they’re now gray and wrinkled, and they spoke about how there had been signs of his psychosis but they had chosen to ignore it. They thought it was just a childhood phase. A recent mugshot of Charlie was also shown. He’s now bald and chubby, but the thing that got me was that smile on his face. It looked as if he had been laughing. That smile said he had felt absolutely no guilt for what he had done and that wishes he had been able to feed the rest of me to his children.
