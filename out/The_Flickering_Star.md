My father never believed our planet was alone in the dark. He didn’t mean aliens, in a strictly sci-fi sense, but in a more ancient and primordial degree. He believed there was something ancient, something that slept dormant within realities core. Waking only to bring its designs to an end.  Grief can be an alluring gateway to madness….

He worked as an astrophysicist at a small observatory in eastern Rhode Island. Growing up I used to visit him during his late shifts. His work environment reeked of old degrading electronics, and long neglected dust. The one piece of equipment he did keep in good repair was his state of the art telescope, the “Leviathan”. Aptly named for how it towered over everything, and everyone in the room it was housed.

After mom died, I stopped seeing him at work. I didn’t see him more; a nanny was hired to take care of my brother and I. Father became cold, and distant. I slowly gave up trying to have a meaningful connection with him as every conversation I attempted to have was dulled by his apparent distracted attention. He would nod through my stories of my personal life, but I could tell his focus was on his work, on what the “Leviathan” was showing him.

All this changed two years ago. Inexplicably he texted me, asking me to come work with him. I was hesitant…and a little resentful. Knowing he wanted to see me, but the focal point of this “reconnection” being at his work felt….hollow. I didn’t have the heart to turn him down though. It had been hard enough losing mom, maybe I could pull dad back from his grief and salvage our failed relationship.

When I arrived the laboratory was spotless. My father’s eyes were bloodshot, and he was grimly pale, moving erratically as he greeted me. I was shocked to see no evidence of a single spec of dust throughout the laboratory. It was as if he had been intent to rid even the smallest of distractions from the purity of his work.

“Come here. You HAVE to look,” he whispered aggressively. His emaciated hand clutched my arm and dragged me behind him. He lead me up a flight of metal stairs to the Leviathan.

“You need to see it,” He said flatly gesturing to the enormous telescope before dashing away from me and fiddling through the room. I could hear him cleaning compulsively as I leaned into the eyepiece. I expected to see celestial, but predictable scenery, perhaps a cool combination of colors from a gas planet.

What I saw perplexed me.

I was beholding a star, unlike any I had ever seen. It was pulsing in rhythm.  
A slow pulse.  
A fast pulse.  
Followed by three pulses of such blistering speed my eyes almost failed to discern them as a singular burst. Each pulse corresponded with a change in color.

“Is the telescope broken” I asked bewildered, trying to think how a celestial body could be changing color so rapidly.

“No. The Leviathan is perfect. I keep it perfect. It will ALLWAYS be perfect,” my father said as he rubbed his hand against the metal casing of the instrument. His eyes were fierce and protective. His gaze pierced into me like he wanted to accuse me of heresy for doubting the proficiency of his sacred object.

Before I could protest at how this would be impossible: outside of atmospheric scintillation which I had presumed the Leviathan had been modified to account for; he threw down a thick stack of paper. He began scattering the papers about, suddenly disinterested in his fascination for cleanliness. My edification of his grand discovery trumping any other sense of reason. I could barely keep up with his cascade of firmly asserted facts as he detailed his years of meticulous documentation.

“The pulses; they match binary. This star is alive. This star is SPEAKING to me. It is now speaking to you,” this was the first statement since his rambling I could properly understand.

I was doubtful, and hurt. To know he had spent so much time away from the family that needed him….only to be pulled into such a delusion over what could only possibly be explained from a faulty telescope struck my soul. However I bit my tongue. Hopefully in time I could get him to see the error of his ways.

For the next week I continued to visit him at the laboratory. The pattern of the stars pulsing remained consistent, but grew in intensity. I was surprised that there were not any other variations in this sequence. Assuredly a broken telescope would eventually have more variance in its faulty readings? This question became an afterthought as I began to have the dreams:

I was floating listlessly over a vast crimson landscape. The scenery below me had thick massive crevices filled with black shadowy depths, separating the red landmasses. These now cracked stretches of scarlet sheened and reflected like polished clay. The crevice below me grew in its well of darkness. The red land being thrust in every direction with a clamor of unholy sounds as the darkness conquered it.

Something stirred in that expanding darkness. A shape like a serpent made of white wispy fire. It circled around in an oval shaped pattern as if it was racing to see its tail. Its movement was elegant, but jarring. Like it was sleep “slithering” but with baleful purpose.

I awoke with a taste of burn metal in my mouth and a bloody nose. My father had a similar dream; as did some of his astronomer colleagues. My father was delighted that the star was “speaking” to me as it had for him. I was worried. Worried that there was far more likely, some kind of foreign substance was being exposed to us.

Was it lubricant he used to maintain the Leviathan? Was it the cleaners he used to keep the workspace spotless? I could not explain how his colleagues, working from other laboratories in other states would have the same dream. I pressed my father on this, trying to discern if they had the same Leviathan as I was curious if they would be exposed to the same glitchy sequence of light. My father was disinterested in my inquiry, his sole focus consumed with deciphering what the star was speaking to us.  

Three days later, the color in the stars sequence changed. Shortly after the Leviathan broke. It’s sensors had been fried from the luminance of the star it attempted to perceive. A luminance it was sharing to the peering eye of my father who had leaned into its eye piece. My father started screaming, in a mix of torturous pain, and cathartic delight.

“It beheld me! It SPOKE my name!” My father rasped. My tolerance for this madness expired abruptly as I ripped my cell phone from my pocket and dialed 911.

The ambulance had to wrangle my father into the stretcher. He was half blind but fully defiant. He writhed and pleaded not to be “taken out of range”….whatever the hell that meant.

The laboratory is no defunct.

My father….is not getting better.

The doctors have informed me that, even sedated he whispers numbers, sequences, and indiscernible codes of information. He will do this for hours on end until his throat begins to bleed. He colors on his walls. The craftsmanship of his madness being a red oval shape with a misty composition. He laments that the color is off.

“It should be colorless. It would be so BEUATIFUL colorless” he rambles. The thing is…he paints with white paint.

On my last visit his madness had magnified. He clutched my wrists with his bony hand and screamed to me.

“It wasn’t a star! It was more, FAR more glorious. It is the perfect being! The PERFECT state of existence,” his pupils were hardly visible as he said this to me. I was stunned, and in my moment of hesitance he leaned forward and pressed  his skull against mine.

“It didn’t choose me….it chose you!” I didn’t stay to hear the rest of his madness.

My father died a few days later.

With his death my dreams have become more intense. They are always the same, but their vividness varies.  After experimentation I have discovered this vividness correlates with how close I sleep to the defunct laboratory. I can’t explain this, I can’t explain any of this. The only thing I can explain is:

I am moving the hell out of this state.
