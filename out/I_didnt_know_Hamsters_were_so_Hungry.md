My hamster had always been my favorite companion in the whole wide world; I would feed him pellets by hand and gush at the way his cheeks puffed as he ate more than his fill. 

When I cleaned his cage, Monty would sit patiently on the plastic rock I had gotten him to sleep under. He would always sniff the air like he was searching for something, then yawn wide and long, opening his mouth like he was trying to swallow me whole.

Monty would run and run on his wheel for hours; he never ran out of energy, I thought. Most likely had something to do with him always munching something; he even tried to bite the cat!

One night, I was extra tired after doing extended badminton practice--my coach had gotten angry after our team lost their chance at getting the pizza party; I cried myself to sleep that night, blaming Susan for stepping on my shoe.

**Crack.**

I tossed and turned, not quite knowing why my sleep had been interrupted. When I started to doze off again--

**Snap.**

Tossing again, I buried my head in the blanket, still unaware of what was happening just beside my bed.

**Rattle.** **Schlop.**

*Why is that dang hamster being so noisy?* I wondered, peeling the blanket from my face, then reached for the nightlight on the table beside my bed.

My eyes widened. Monty was nowhere to be found, and a hole twice his size had been carved out from his cage. I moved closer, already fearing the worst.

After turning the bedroom light on, I looked at the cage. The jagged metal wires covered in fresh blood looked like they had been broken from the inside out, and wood chip bedding spotted the desk and floor.

An unnaturally deep voice filled my ears, "Jenny..."

I stumbled back, nearly knocking over Monty's cage; a scream built in my throat that came out as a croak.

"Fear not, provider of savory treats." 

It slithered out from underneath the bed. 

It still resembled Monty, sort of. Its head had split in two, large incisors lining both sides of its mouth thing. Its paws elongated into pointy tentacles that sucked at the hardwood floor; each step popped in my ears.

Its tongue which swung at the air like a blade, flung yellow liquid after each syllable.

"Bring the green pellets, and I shall take away that which plagues your mind." As it spoke, the same yellow fluid dripped from the corners of its eyes.

I scrambled for the bag of hamster food beside the desk and tossed it at the creature; and it pounced onto the food with the snap of its jaws.

It shrieked a high-pitched wail I thought would certainly wake up my parents, but when I looked around, the room had become a pocket that looked like northern lights.

Monty purred as it tore into the bag and gulped at what I assumed had to be delicious treats, I almost wanted to try some myself. Incisors left deep grooves in the floor, and the yellow liquid flooded out endlessly; slowly covering the entire bedroom. 

I shot back towards the wall as the liquid flooded closer and closer to my feet. It bubbled and slurped as it crept up to me; I pressed myself to the wall, and squeezed my eyes shut. My whole body cringed when the luke-warm liquid touched my big toe.

The day flashed behind my eyes. Hamsters of every color watched my badminton practice, all hidden in different spots. A brown and white one chewed on a piece of popcorn under the bleachers. A gray one hung upside down with its claws on the school banner, and the most disturbing one, a pure black hamster with piercing yellow eyes watched from my mother's purse.

In my locker, a pure white hamster chewed the corner of my notebook, and on the ride home, countless hamsters crossed the road with reckless abandon; not a single one had been run over. At dinner, three chubby hamsters shared my peas and corn while I was none the wiser. 

I fell to the floor and vomited more green pellets that came out in bursts each time my stomach cramped. Monty waddled over, tentacles slopped in the yellow mess, and drove its split face into the green mound. It wriggled happily, drenching my pajamas.

"Delicious. Please. I must have more." 

I tried to stand, but the world fell from underneath me. Everything that I had ever known disappeared with a **Pop.**

Only darkness surrounded me as I floated weightless; a strange comfort settled over my limbs like a warm bath, and for the first time since after practice, I felt relieved. Susan had been controlled by hamsters--obviously; why else would she ruin our chances at the pizza party?

I opened my eyes.

The earth floated just in front of me, I watched as the oceans slowly turned green and the continents pocked with burrowing holes. 

Yellow liquid slobbered from above, stretching like slime as it fell onto the planet. Monty's yellowed teeth glinted in the sun.

"One more for the road," it thrummed, deep into my being. I felt the voice as it vibrated the marrow in my bones. 

Its mouth-face opened wide.

**Crunch.**
