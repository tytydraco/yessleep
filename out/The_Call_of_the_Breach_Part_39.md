[\[Part 38\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ksjynf/the_call_of_the_breach_part_38/)

Snow crunched under my boots, but I couldn’t feel the ground beneath my feet, every toe having gone numb seven miles back. Gray clouds hung thick in the early morning sky, and a light curtain of snowflakes fluttered down in a dreary haze. Icy wind nipped at my face, and whatever skin couldn’t hide under my upturned uniform collar stung from the constant attack. My knees, hips, and ankles throbbed from mile after mile of frigid terrain covered throughout the night, every muscle stretched to a breaking point. Even counting my first escape from Black Oak, I’d run more than ever before in my life, and the only thing that kept the pain from growing worse was the incessant cold.

*Snap.*

A twig broke in the undergrowth not far to my right, and several of the troops in the column behind me flinched.

My hand darted for the submachine gun at my side, and I squinted into the brush-laden forest with weary apprehension.

*Just grow a pair and bound on us already.*

The withdrawal from Black Oak had shattered our forces, and my two haggard platoons were one of many groups that spread out over the desolate countryside to avoid ELSAR patrols. Anyone caught in the open risked being struck by drones, mortars, or ran down by motorcycle squads. If we tried to set up a new defensive line, the enemy simply rolled tanks and artillery forward to blow holes in our positions. Our radios were a mix of static and garbled transmissions, which I guessed to be jamming resumed by the mercenaries. Yet even as we managed to distance ourselves from our human pursuers through sheer force of will and immense suffering, our broken little army ran face-first into old threats.

Through the tangled multiflora rose bushes, I caught the blur of slate-colored hide as the carnivore loped away into the trees, its long forelimbs moving with fluid speed. Worn to the bone from our march, I found *the focus* harder to bring up than ever, but still managed to sharpen my ears enough to detect the low reptilian chitters of the pack as they circled out of eyesight.

“Don’t these things ever sleep?” One of the younger boys in our line grumbled, his bloodshot eyes heavy with fatigue.

At my elbow, Jamie flexed her grip on her AK and glared at the forest. “They hunt in relays, like our African Painted Dogs used to. Two thirds of the pack are probably resting somewhere nearby. These are just the fresh ones sent to keep tabs on us.”

Turning on the spot, I scanned the woods on either side and did my best to peer through the noise with my enhanced senses, ragged as they were. Despite the Breach being closed, and the impending slip of Barron County through it, the mutants hadn’t abated; quite the opposite. It seemed there were more sunlight-adapted freaks now than ever before, and our desperate march south had been plagued with run-ins with the local wildlife. The Crawlers had been tracking us since we first stumbled across a kill site of theirs ten miles south of Black Oak, shadowing us with hungry anticipation, always just out of view in the scrub.

*They know we’re tired; they can smell it, taste it, feel it in the air. They can hear it in our breathing, our heartbeats, the shuffle of our feet on the ground. These things . . . it’s like they were born to kill us.*

In spite of my nagging doubts, I shut both eyes to concentrate and picked out the distinct footfalls of three Crawlers. They were small, light on their feet and short, marking them as adolescents, younger males sent ahead to scout for the pack. From how they slunk away into the woods, I knew they were building confidence to initiate some kind of attack, likely to come around nightfall when our vision would be limited. These monsters were smart, too smart, and it made me shudder to think how many of them could venture into the light that had once kept us safe from them.

“Captain.” At my shoulder, Sergeant McPhearson kept his voice low so the others couldn’t as easily overhear, though I knew those in our column from Ark River could listen in on our conversation with the same ease as I’d detected the Birch Crawlers. “We need to find a place to stop. Ferguson’s got a sucking chest wound, Bates is coughing up blood, and we’re going to lose more men if we can’t find a way to get warm.”

“I know.” I bit my lip, and the flesh split the cold, dry air, so that I tasted coppery blood. “But we’ll lose everyone if the mercs catch up. We’ll stop soon, just not yet.”

At my arm signal, the column slogged onward, boots dragged across the frozen earth, and weary heads bobbed along in silent procession. I stood to the side as they passed and did my best to mutter small bits of encouragement to each of them as they came.

“Not much further; just a few more miles, you’ll see . . . we’re almost there, just keep at it . . . it’s just up ahead, don’t worry.”

Truth be told, I had only a vague idea where we were and took a moment to peer at my small map while the platoon trudged on. By my reckoning we had to be somewhere near Rally Point 9, but with how chaotic retreat from Black Oak was, I didn’t know how much further it could be. We might be one mile away or twenty, but with my thinking dulled by caloric deficit, sleep deprivation, and shock, I had a difficult time plotting a directional azimuth with my compass.

*It's not far. It’s going to be just around the bend, you’ll see. Chris will be there, with a roast turkey, a hot bath, and enough blankets to smother us both.*

With a deep sigh of longing, I snapped the map case shut and hooked it back onto my war belt. Thinking like that could kill me almost as fast as standing still would. Already my limbs cried out in protest at the sudden halt, wishing I had continued in my trance-like pace. There would be no rest, no safety, no end to this cold, dizzying nightmare until we regrouped with the others, and even then, I doubted we would be greeted by a luxurious campsite. Instead, I hefted my Type 9 on one shoulder and forced myself to take one step after the other through the wintry wasteland.

At some point, the forest trail opened into a winding section of old road and greeted me with the gruesome sight of four burned-out trucks, the ground cratered around the fire-blackened hulks from whatever barrage had struck them. Charred and mutilated corpses lay both inside and outside the trucks, evidence that some of the crew survived long enough to clamber out before the flames rendered them immobile. Most were New Wilderness or resistance fighters, but there were a few wearing the medieval-styled cuirass of Ark River, all dead long enough for the snow to collect on their melted faces.

“There were more.” Jamie stood in the road and pointed to several tire tracks that went on into the distance, half-buried by the ongoing light snowfall. “Looks like most of the convoy got away. I’d say this was our left flank, or at least part of it.”

Further on down the road, we discovered a cluster of two dozen refugees scattered across the snow next to a smoldering cattle shed. They appeared to have been huddled around a fire, one not two hours old from my deduction, and had been cooking several measly pots of rice and beans when the rockets took them. Shrapnel turned their bodies to minced meat, the cooking pots like sieves for all the holes punched through them, and the air stank of blood. A gaggle of Speaker Crabs scuttled away at our approach, the radio-shaped Technos blaring their garbled songs in protest at us interrupting their carrion feast, but otherwise gave no challenge.

Charlie hugged his arms to himself as our two platoons spread out to search the corpses, his lips chapped from the cold so that they cracked in a few places like mine. “They probably didn’t even hear it coming. Must have been some kind of drone strike.”

Too miserable to reply, I stared down at the huddled lumps of flesh that had once been a woman and a little boy. She’d held him in her arms to keep the cold at bay, and their guts mingled together from the chunk of steel that had ripped their torsos apart. They hadn’t even let go of one another, simply fell back in the snow, and it made a sour taste rise in the back of my mouth. Just to see the boy, perhaps no older than four or five years old, made me remember the words whispered to me by the *One* after the closing of the Breach. He’d promised me so much, told me of our future beyond this reality, gave me a faith I’d never had before. I would suffer before the end, that much He had said, but even after everything I’d endured, this still rattled me to my core. How could this be part of His plan?

*I just want to see Chris again. I want to be warm. I want to sleep.*

Finding nothing we moved on, trading equipment back and forth to give carriers a chance to rest. I did my best to go as long with the heavy machine guns, bulky mortar tubes, or rocket launchers as the boys did, but I noticed that like the other girls, I struggled to keep up. With our trucks and careful planning, we Rangers had always been able to keep a roughly level playing field between the few women of our faction and the men, but now that we were on foot, it seemed nature had turned on its daughters. One girl stumbled under a heavy rucksack and her left hip made an odd *pop*, after which she couldn’t stand for the severe pain. The three medics with us confirmed she’d likely broken a chunk of her hip bone off, sheered by the ruck’s weight on her diminutive frame. Already burdened by wounded, we had to make another litter out of saplings and a spare poncho. This only doubled the amount of gear the rest of us had to bear, along with the stretchers for the wounded, and made things all the more insufferable.

Mile after mile we went, through snow-bound forests and frosted clearings, past abandoned farmhouses and more vehicle wreckage. Sometimes we found evidence of our retreating forces, other times old remains of ELSAR casualties from our previous advance on Black Oak. The snow let up around mid-day, but the sky remained overcast, the wind harsh and cutting. It seemed the humid air combined with the cruel temperatures to slice right through our clothes like they were made of butter, and the chattering of teeth became commonplace amongst our ranks.

Closer to noon, we stopped at an empty hay barn to rest, and one of our riflemen chipped enough of the frozen dirt away with his E-tool to make a small fire pit in the middle of the dirt floor. We all knew it tempted fate, the sheet-metal roof of the barn not enough to prevent thermal detection from ELSAR’s drones high above the snow clouds, but at the same time everyone was too tired to care. Thus, I crouched around the little blaze with the rest, trying to work some feeling into my fingers while the medics tended to our wounded.

*Bang.*

The shot made half of us dive to the chaff-covered ground and drew a clammer of loud curses. Younger members of our group threw naïve glances to the outside, as if the enemy might have been the source, but I noticed the dark stain on the far wall of the clapboard barn and my heart sank.

“Mother of Christ.” Jamie breathed in a mournful wince, as if beholding a train wreck she couldn’t bring herself to look away from.

Ferguson’s stretcher lay at the base of the crimson spatter, his arms curled around a rifle, the muzzle jammed in his mouth. Chunks of gray brain matter and scarlet blood plastered the dried oak woodwork of the barn, and the man’s brown eyes stared sightless at the joists above us, as if seeing beyond the old tin roof to something far, far away. Two of his companions worked to pry the gun from his clammy hands, swearing like sailors with angry tears of regret in their eyes, but no one bothered to attempt first aid. Instead, Sergeant McPhearson pulled a moldy tarp from the corner of the barn to cover Ferguson with it, after which the others stripped him of his gear and the stretcher he lay on.

Watching them carry his knapsack off, I fought a gnawing pang of guilt. Such things were too valuable to leave behind, but it still felt like a barbaric desecration, given he’d been one of our own not five minutes prior.

*We can’t even give him a proper burial; there’s not enough time, the ground’s half-frozen, and no one has enough energy to dig.*

“He wouldn’t have made it another five miles anyway.” An older medic seated not far from me didn’t even look surprised, his gaunt face wrapped in a scarf to keep the cold at bay. “Lungs were filling up with blood. I’d choose a bullet too, if it were me.”

From her stretcher a few yards away, the girl with a broken hip bone turned her pale face to the wall and sobbed into her blanket.

We left the barn without much ceremony in the next ten minutes, mounding dusty hay over Ferguson’s corpse so the Crawler’s would have a harder time finding him. No one dared suggest burning the barn, or risk drawing in fighter jets with missiles thanks to the huge smoke pall it would have generated. I knew the mutants would still locate the body eventually, their sense of smell unmatched by anything else, but it made some of the shame ebb knowing that our man hadn’t been left to rot on the bare ground. We were still humans after all; this world belonged to us, and even in the end, tradition separated us from the monsters that haunted our steps.

Several hours later, I staggered forth at the vanguard, trying my best to navigate the frozen wasteland, but as we entered a smaller forest between two hills, the skin on the back of my neck crawled with a rush of unease.

*Oh man.*

It rippled into my chest, an icy prickle of warning that I couldn’t quite decipher. I knew it had to be *the focus* aiding me as it had so many times prior, my heightened senses aware of something that I had yet to notice, but in my exhausted state I had no idea what it might be. I could have sworn I had hallucinated multiple times on the march, my eyes playing tricks on me to make shapes and movement appear where there was none.

Looking back over my shoulder, I noticed the entire column halted in expectation, the Ark River folk rigid with the same expression of concern that I wore. The normal human fighters cast nervous glances at one another, the instinct of our golden-haired allies renowned in the coalition, and eyed the trees around them for signs of life.

“Listen.” A bearded Ark River warrior named Zephaniah cocked his blonde head to one side and worked each leg to get some of the feeling back from the cold. “Do you hear that?”

I mimicked him, angled my head to one side, and heard nothing but wind in the barren ice-coated trees.

*There were noises a moment ago, ravens, firedrakes, ringer heads.*

At my nod of understanding, Zephaniah thumbed his rifle’s safety off, and the others did the same down the line, a muffled cascade of little metallic *clicks*.

Sliding my palm down to the grip on my Type 9, I pulled in a deep breath and peered into the nearby trees. Silence in the woods never meant anything good. Animals only went silent when something bad was about to happen, usually a predator ambushing its prey. Of course, the winter had driven most birds, bugs, and the like into migration or hibernation, but still there should have been something.

*Crack.*

One of our men screamed, and a dull gray blur dove from the underbrush, the enormous log-shaped head clamping down over his torso. In a fraction of a second, the Crawler leapt out of sight into the forest, leaving only a trail of fresh blood in its wake.

*Bam, bam, bam.*

More of our frightened column opened up, shooting into the surrounding trees with abandon. I doubted they could even see the mutants, since most of the Ark River fighters held their fire as I did. This pack must have been in contact with people enough to know we were dangerous in numbers, so they would bleed us one by one, until either they grew satisfied with their kill, or we ran out of bullets. With our vision limited by the forest around us, the mutants could run right up to us, and we would never see them until it was too late.

*We have to get out in the open.*

Craning my neck from side to side, I glimpsed brilliant white snow between the trees, the faint aura of another neglected field buried by winter’s touch. “The clearing! Fire teams bound for the clearing! *Move!*”

Despite their exhaustion, my men did their best to perform the move as we’d done both in training and in combat, but fear seemed to be just as strong as our fatigue. More than a few broke and ran for the edge of the trees, leaving a dwindling number of us to cover their retreat as the Birch Crawlers swept in from all sides.

A smaller adolescent lunged from the bushes to my left, and I swung my Type 9 around to stitch the Crawler’s tough hide with lead.

*Brat-tat-tat-tat.*

Scarcely had it fell, and another flung itself at Jamie, who cut it down with a burst from her AK. The beast landed with a dense *thud* not two yards from us, its eyeless head twitching in death. More followed in the steps of their brethren, and the heat shroud over my weapon’s barrel warmed as I fired round after round into the shrieking onslaught.

“Help me!” A terrified scream pierced the din, and I whirled in horror to see the girl with a shattered hip crawling over the ground, her stretcher discarded. Standing over the torn cloth litter, one of the mutants swung its blood-smeared muzzle in the girl’s direction, bits of the stretcher bearers packed in between its steak-knife sized teeth.

My blood turned to ice, and I raised the submachine gun in my hands to sight in on the beast.

*Click.*

*No.*

Her eyes met mine in mute terror as the bolt of my weapon slid home on an empty magazine.

In a flash the Crawler swept the wounded girl up in its jaws and shook her with vicious intensity. Screeches of agony filled the air, the crunching of bones as they broke and squelching of flesh as it tore. A shower of red flecks pockmarked the snow around the monster’s curled feet, and some landed on my cheek in a stomach-churning spray.

“Hannah, come on!” Jamie yanked on my arm, the last of our column in a headlong flight through the barren trees.

I tore myself away from the scene, but not before I witnessed the Crawler toss the mutilated girl high in the air to catch her like a dog with its toy. She was still wailing, but both legs were gone, the meat shredded down to the bone, and as soon as she landed back in the maw of the predator, the screaming cut off.

Terrified, I slipped and slid on the snow, crashed through brambles, and dodged trees in a breathless sprint that made my head swim from the effort. On each side, the last of our defense fled with me, and the mutants hurtled in with nightmarish speed. The woods rippled with their alien war cries, prehistoric roars that would have given my ancestors panic attacks. For two thousand years, mankind had fought to drive the darkness back, and now it seemed history returned with a vengeance.

A claw swiped from the bushes, and one of my men took two more steps before his torso separated from his lower half in a clean cut, intestines spilling onto the ground like gory bundles of rope. He didn’t make a sound, just blinked and died where he stood, his parts scooped up by a predator’s hungry maw.

Deep growls echoed to my left, and one of the Ark River fighters vanished into the thorns, blade in hand even as he shrieked in pain.

Jamie’s face shone whiter than the snow, and she ran with a pace that held nothing back, her long legs pushed to their limit in desperate fear. Somewhere out of the corner of my eye, a snout closed the distance to her, the mutant right on my friend’s heels.

In the next instant, my right foot burst through the tree line, but as I charged out into the snowy field, a fallen branch snagged in my laces.

Panic surged in my veins, and I froze in dread as I tumbled into the snow, the figure behind Jamie pivoting toward me.

*I’m dead.*

With my submachine gun pinned under one arm, I stared up at the veritable wall of razor-sharp teeth, my world going into slow motion. I couldn’t use my sonic scream, or I’d risk crippling our men with the blast. My pistol would never clear leather in time to shoot, and Jamie was already too far ahead to reach me. Death would come in mere seconds, a crushing, tearing, torturous end where I slid down the greasy gullet of my enemy, only to gasp my last breath in its fetid throat.

*Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.*

Thunderous shots broke me from the trance I’d been in, and the Crawler collapsed right next to me as a hail of bullets ripped into the mutants. Tracers zipped across the open field, muzzle flashes in the distant trees, and white-clad figures emerged from amongst them to charge in our direction. Two enormous metal hulks rolled with them, and I picked up the unmistakable clatter of steel tank tracks.

*ELSAR. How did they get behind us? We’re caught in a pincer.*

My heart raced as the screaming troops closed in, and I rolled to bring the stubby iron sights of my weapon to bear, finger pressed to the cold steel trigger.

The man in my sights noticed me, but instead of bringing his rifle around to do the same, he waved one arm high in the air, his breath coming out in gusts of steam. “Friendly, friendly, friendly!”

Dozens of voices carried this mantra across the advancing ranks, and I blinked to see two gargantuan M1 Abrams tanks rumble by, flying coalition green flags. Machine gunners in the turrets emptied their weapons into the furious Crawlers, who in turn either died or fled on their approach. Beneath the snow suits, which I realized were nothing more than improvised white bedsheets, the Carhart overhauls of the Workers poked forth along with their characteristic rabbit fur hats. Their foot soldiers advanced to help our men, throwing hand grenades in waves to drive the mutants back, while a flamethrower trooper powered up his unit to spew fiery liquid diesel into the underbrush.

*I’ve never been so happy to see greasy overhauls in my entire life.*

“That was close, huh?” Grinning from ear to ear the man I’d nearly shot, a lanky fellow in his late twenties, cradled his steaming submachine gun in one arm and gave me a hand up. “Sorry we didn’t come sooner. We heard the shots, but thought you were the mercs. Had a ski patrol of them walk right by us three hours ago, headed off somewhere to the west.”

Brushing the snow from my clothes, I accepted a canteen cup one of the worker men offered, and shivered in pleasure at finding it filled with a weak but hot tea. “Trust me, your timing is perfect, lieutenant. We weren’t going to get much further on our own. How many are with you?”

“All that’s left this far north, I figure.” The officer jerked his thumb over one shoulder. “Aid station’s back that way, bout a quarter mile, but they’re packing up to move again. We got lucky, captured four enemy tanks last night, so Ethan put two into the perimeter rotation to let the others rest, since we’ll be gone by evening.”

That last part deflated me somewhat, but I tried to focus on the jubilation of arriving at our objective at last. Part of me hadn’t expected us to actually find Rally Point 9; after so many miles, I’d begun to think we were the only coalition troops left alive. Jamie stayed at my side, silent and tense, the entire force withdrawing through the opposite end of the clearing. There, our rescuers went back to their crude foxholes and trenches, while my two beleaguered platoons marched up the slope and over a little hilltop to the main encampment. When the first tent came into sight, I had to blink hard to keep tears of joyous mania from rising in my eyes.

Hidden beneath the tangle of gnarled oaks, the camp was a cluster of low-frames tents, shelters built from forest debris, and vehicles draped in white sheets to help conceal them from ariel view. People moved here and there, mostly nurses and runners, all with dark bags of sleeplessness around their eyes. I could smell the faint aroma of woodsmoke on the air, though it wasn’t as prominent as I would have thought, and I guessed that the fires too were concealed in various dugout shelters like the ones back at the defensive perimeter. As our soldiers wandered in, the various people who weren’t busy with some task turned from their huddles to stare at us with blatant shock on their weary faces, while a nearby file of coalition troops readied a lineup of horses and Bone Faced Whitetail for departure.

“Charlie, find whatever is left of the aid tent and get our troops squared away.” I nodded at Sergeant McPherson and slung my Type 9 onto one shoulder. “For supplies, make ammo your first priority, then water, then meds. Once the boys are under shelter, we can try and find something like food, if it exists.”

At my words, the others dispersed among the camp, while Jamie and I made our way toward a familiar stocky figure among the line of horsemen.

“Major Sanderson.” I nodded at the Worker leader, who turned to blink at us in exhausted surprise. “4^(th) Rifles and 2^(nd) Lancers reporting. I heard we’re already breaking camp?”

Ethan cinched one of the leather straps on his packhorse tighter and let out a grim sigh. “As fast as we can, yeah. ELSAR has ten armored vehicles to our one, and they’re moving fast. We managed to block most of the roads and even brought a few bridges down to slow them, but they kept on coming. We’re running the deer and horses until nightfall; then we take the rest of the vehicles and bug out for the south.”

Jamie raised a golden-brown eyebrow, her hands still trembling though the color had begun to return to her face. “How far south?”

His bloodshot eyes regarded us with cynical resignation, and I wondered how on earth Ethan could still be on his feet since his faction had been the ones to run evacuation shuttles all through the night. “The western pass.”

A chill went through me, one not from the cold, but an immense disappointment. The southern ridgeline demarked the border between what had been the territory of our New Wilderness government and the lands belonging to Ark River. An imposing wall of sharp cliffs formed by tectonic plates shifted by the Breach, it was almost impassable to man and beast, at least the ones on foot. Murky swamps and the poisoned ruins of Collingswood guarded the flanks of the ridgeline, while thick forests prevented most aircraft from making good landings in the interior. Only a few passes existed, and these were monitored by the Ark River folk so as to prevent their discovery by ELSAR troops. It made sense that we would fall back behind this natural barrier, but that would mean giving up every inch of ground we’d taken during the offensive.

*All those men, lost for what?*

Ethan seemed to sense my unease, and shuffled closer to lower his voice between us. “Sean’s gathering whoever can fight at Hallows Run, but we’re split into three groups, all trying to get there without being bombed into splinters. Eve and her people made it to the citadel; she sent word with a runner that they were safe, though Aleph and most of their fighters are still with us. Dekker is somewhere to the northeast, fighting like hell; from what we’ve seen, most of the casualties limping in are from his group. They’re throwing everything they have at the enemy armor, trying to give us enough breathing room to get clear, so everyone can regroup at the pass.”

“Did Sean give any orders regarding us?” I ran a subconscious hand over the launch panel satchel at my hip and tried not to show anxiety at his words about Chris being in the worst of the fighting.

“I’d guess Sean would say to regroup with him as soon as possible.” Ethan gestured to the slumped forms of his men, some of which appeared to be asleep on their feet. “So, when we ride out here in fifteen minutes, your boys can saddle up with ours. I know you’d rather bed down after coming all this way, but ELSAR could show up at any time with more tanks than Stalin. Better safe than sorry.”

I glanced at Jamie, and though she made a tired wince, I could see in her haggard face the same thought in my head. Telling my men that we had to go back out, after promising them we would be done once we got to the rally point would be as welcome as a kick in the nuts, but we didn’t have a choice. Ethan was right; ELSAR wouldn’t slow down, so neither could we. “I’ll let the troops know. We’ll drop our wounded off with your drivers and be ready to go when you are.”

As we walked away, Jamie stumbled a little and let out an exasperated huff at herself. “I can hardly see straight. Last time I was this scatter-brained, I was drunk. Has it been 24 hours yet?”

Checking my watch, I rubbed my eyes and fought the urge to topple over in the snow. “It will be soon. At least we won’t be walking. I might just tie myself to the saddle and pass out.”

Each blink felt like a tease at sleep, and I let my eyelids stay shut longer and longer as we shambled through the camp, daydreaming of intoxicating memories. Most of them were simple; a warm bed, the smell of hot pancakes, the feeling of Chris’s strong arms around me like walls of silky steel. I missed the calming sensation of his smile, his husky voice whispering my name in our intimate moments, the way he snored in the morning. It felt like a fantasy land somewhere far out of reach, this hellish reality one of ice, wet socks, and dizzying exhaustion.

*If we’re tired, Chris’s men have to be dead men walking. Did he remember to bring his change of socks to keep his feet dry? How many tanks are chasing them?*

To my right, Jamie stole a look at me, wearing an expression of pity as if she could read my mind. “He’s smart. Chris will make it through, brave fool that he is. He might even beat us to the pass.”

“A lot of the guys we lost were smart.” I forced my heavy eyelids open to peer at my best friend through the wisps of falling snow. “And brave. Lot of good it did them.”

She stayed quiet for a moment, and we both swayed to a halt near a collection of ramshackle tents where our men lined up for some kind of thin soup ladled out of a rusty kettle. They were ragged, bloodied, staring into nothing as if each soldier was piloted by sheer gravitational pull on his scuffed boots. They hardly looked like the bright-eyed volunteers who had carried us to victory in the offensive not long ago. There were so few of us left, the distance between our scattered forces seemed so great that I could no longer ignore a creeping doubt that gnawed at whatever sacred hope lay in my heart.

“We’re going to lose this war, aren’t we?” Thinking out loud in a muted whisper, I picked at the leather strap of my Type 9 and found that my thumbnail had been worn to a bloody nub.

Her emerald irises roved the chow line with hollow indifference, Jamie hugged the well-worn Kalashnikov to her chest. “It’s been lost for a while now.”

I wanted to cry, but somehow couldn’t find the energy to, my senses numbed, my emotions short circuited. Everything I’d known, everything I’d come to love about this forgotten part of our world was being slowly chipped away by the cruel grind of war. I’d been promised that we would pass on to the next reality, that our coalition would lead mankind to greater glory in the Silo 48 timeline, but how could we if ELSAR hunted us all down? Had I misread the promises of the One? Had He meant our deaths would inspire them? Were we all doomed?

*I know you’re out there; I know you see me. Why are you letting this happen to us? I don’t understand, Adonai.*

“Hey.” A hand touched my arm, and Jamie made a smile, weak and tired, but still hers under all the blood and grime on her pretty features. “It’s not over until it ends. If Sean thinks we have a chance to hunker down in the south and wait them out, then I believe him. With the passes blocked, their tanks won’t make it over that ridge, and they sure as hell can’t land choppers in those woods without us cutting them to shreds. If we make them suffer, make them pay for every square inch, maybe we can hold out until spring. Either way, we don’t make it easy for them.”

*That’s the Jamie I know.*

My own smile felt as weak and foreign as hers in that moment, but it was a nice reprieve all the same. Together we stood in the ankle-high snow and shivered as the winter bore down on us with the same fury as our enemies. We were being backed into a corner, and with nowhere to run, sooner or later we would have to make a stand. Odds were, Sean had that very idea in mind for Hallows Run, but could we hope to stop Crow and her soldiers if they had such immense firepower on their side? The enemy had to be aware of the direction we had retreated, they weren’t stupid; Koranti certainly knew of Ark River’s existence. The only reason the fortress was standing was his inability to strike it by air up until now, and his desire to capture as many of Eve’s folk as possible for his research. How long it would remain so was anyone’s guess, but I had the nagging feeling that the south wouldn’t be safe forever. ELSAR was too close behind us, and more likely than not, we’d have to face them one last time in open battle before the campaign ended for the year.

Looking down at my uniform sleeve, I noted the knitted stripes on my cuff, the tin bars on my collar lapel, rank denoting an officer of the coalition. I’d taken an oath to fight for our fledgling government, for the future of our people, for the dreams Chris had shared with me in his room at New Wilderness. I couldn’t let him down, even if I knew the path forward led us to almost certain death.

*So be it then. We make our stand in the south . . . and hope that Crow doesn’t get there first.*
