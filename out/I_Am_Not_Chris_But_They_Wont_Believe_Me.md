Before you ask: no, I won’t tell you my real name, where I live, or anything about myself that isn’t absolutely necessary. Why? Because, as you’ll soon learn, my privacy has already been violated in ways I never thought possible. I have no intention of going through that nightmare again.



Secondly, by the time you finish reading this, you’ll probably be shocked that you’ve never heard of it before—and I wouldn’t blame you. I’ve searched endlessly for any trace of this story, but despite over forty years having passed, I haven’t found a single article or report. I wish that weren’t the case, but someone has to tell it. And it looks like I may be the only one left who can—or will.



It all began in my hometown, Hollow Creek, West Virginia. In my experience, Southerners love to get into pissing contests over who grew up in the tiniest, most backwoods hellhole, but I’ve got them all beat. My hometown was so damn small it doesn't even exist anymore—Hollow Creek was abandoned and wiped off the map around '96. 



It’s rather fitting, when you think about it, how the infamous Hunt-Lenox globe once warned explorers of uncharted territories with the phrase, "Hic Sunt Dracones"—"Here be Dragons." Hollow Creek, a forgotten town that exists only in the fading memories of a select few, is missing from any map you'll ever find. It may not have had dragons, but it did have a monster.



And his name was Chris.



It was 1975. I was 26, an English teacher at the only public school in Hollow Creek—not that there were any private schools either. When people think of the South, they usually picture deserts, bayous, and sunshine. But not that day. That day in December, it was cold as all get out, and the snow was coming down so heavy they almost called a snow day—a real rarity. Unfortunately for the handful of kids who actually lived in town, it wasn’t to be. School was still on.



One by one, the students shuffled in, throwing off their jackets with a dramatic huff, so synchronized it felt like they had secretly choreographed the whole performance. Their eyes fixed on me with intense, smouldering resentment, as if I were personally responsible for making them trudge through a blizzard to get to school.



All except one. One lonely, solitary chair—front row, two seats from the left—sat empty. Ezra Calloway’s chair. I assumed he was just running late—ice storms can be a bit of an inconvenience, after all. I started the lesson regardless, reading from Jack London’s *The Call of the Wild*. But by the third chapter, I could no longer ignore it. That empty chair stood out like a lone buoy in a sea of unenthused young faces. Still no sign of Ezra.



“Let’s take a break,” I announced, watching their faces light up—far more than I’d ever seen, even in the midst of the most gripping literature I could offer them.



As my students began to chatter amongst themselves, I flipped through the school registry, found the number for the Calloway residence, and dialed it. I twisted my finger in the rotary dial, one number at a time, then tapped my fingers nervously along the edge of the desk as I waited for someone to pick up.



Finally, the line connected. A hysterical voice cut through the static. "Hello?!" a woman shouted, her voice frantic. "Hello?! Who is this?!"



"Mrs. Calloway?" I replied hesitantly, more than a little unsettled by the panic in her voice.



"Yes? Yes! Who is this? Who's calling?" 



"This is Mr. X, we've met before, I'm—"



"—I KNOW WHO YOU ARE!" she screamed, the volume so intense it practically left my ears ringing. A few of the students glanced over, having clearly heard her voice through the receiver.



"Mrs. Calloway—"



"You're done. DONE! You hear me?! DONE!" she shrieked, her words sharp and furious.



Across the room, eyes shifted towards the empty chair. Two boys leaned in close to each other, and I could just barely make out one of them murmuring something about ‘Chris.’



Wordlessly, I snapped my fingers in their direction, trying to quiet them down. When I turned back to the receiver, all I heard was the dial tone. Mrs. Calloway had hung up.



Feeling a growing sense of unease, I slowly lowered the phone back onto the cradle and paused. Ezra wasn’t here, and his mom had sounded frantic. A thought crept in, and I began to worry the kids were right. Maybe it *was* Chris.

For those unaware—basically everyone still left on this Earth—'Chris' had been Hollow Creek's one and only boogeyman since at least 1962. But unlike the usual imagined ghoul behind that title, Chris was far more real.



In December of 1962, 8-year-old Jesse Booker vanished without a trace. The details of the story shift depending on who you ask, but here’s the version I heard most often: Jesse was playing in what folks in Hollow Creek called a ‘park’—though, in reality, it was just a patch of trees and a fence, with some local politician brazen enough to slap their name on it like a badge of honour. Jesse was with an unnamed friend, caught up in a snowball fight, laughing and having a great time. That’s when someone—a young man, I should mention—emerged from the treeline. For context, I would’ve only been 13 at the time. He introduced himself as Chris and asked if he could join in on the fun.



Decades before the ‘stranger danger’ craze took hold, the two young boys saw no reason to refuse the request. So, they welcomed this ‘Chris’ into their snowball fight without a second thought. 



Chris seemed to be having a great time, laughing and running around, shouting as he joined in the game—until one of his icy projectiles hit Jesse square in the nose. There must have been a rock, a chunk of ice, something hard in that snowball, because Jesse immediately burst into tears, blood streaming from his nose as quickly as the tears fell from his eyes.



But Jesse wasn’t the only one crying. Chris was crying too. He rushed over to Jesse, scooped him up in his arms, and held him tightly against his chest, whimpering as he cradled the sobbing, squirming boy. With tears streaming down his face, Chris turned to Jesse’s friend and told him to stay put—he was going to take Jesse to the hospital and would be right back.



And off he went, with Jesse clutched in his arms like a fly caught in a web. Jesse was never seen again—alive, at least—and his companion was found later that night, sitting beneath a snow-covered tree, just as he’d been told, waiting for Jesse to come back. The only thing he could ask his parents was, “Is Jesse alright?”



As you’ve likely guessed, Jesse was not alright. It took three full days before his body was discovered—or most of it, anyway.



There’s a hiking spot on the edge of town called ‘Shooting Star Trails,’ though ‘Asterisk Trails’ would’ve been a more fitting name. It’s named for the six paths branching out from a central hub, forming a star-like shape. That hub was always a mess—picnic tables half-sunken in muck, surrounded by litter that no one ever bothered to clean up.



A hiker, snowshoer, or cross-country skier—depending on who tells the story—was travelling along the north ‘Central’ trail when they spotted a small, dark object resting in the middle of the path. Its blackness stood out starkly against the pristine, pearly snow, something the traveller described as looking like "charcoal on a canvas." Closer inspection revealed the grisly truth—it was a head. Nothing more, nothing less. Almost as repulsive as the sight was the smell. It wasn’t the odour of rot or decay—the biting cold had kept that at bay—but a sour, pungent miasma, sharp and acrid, like an overturned drum of vinegar.



The man raced back to town as fast as his legs would allow, gathering a search party to find the rest of the boy’s body. Meanwhile, the mayor scrambled to contact the authorities, though in a town with just a single phone and even fewer police officers, the odds weren’t in their favour.



The group soon arrived at the hub of Shooting Star Trails and divided into four search parties. They had just come from the southern entrance and found nothing, and already knew the northern central trail only led to the head. So, they split up, sending one group down each of the remaining paths: the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Before long, terrified reports trickled back from each group. The northeast contingent had found a right hand, the southeast a right foot, and the southwest a left foot. But the northwest group found nothing—no trace of Jesse, not even a hair. All they discovered was a groove in the snow, where something had recently been placed, speckled with blood, and a lingering, sour stench of vinegar in the air.



That was the end of poor Jesse Booker.



Though years separated each victim, the method remained chillingly consistent. First, the disappearance, followed by dismemberment—always in the dead of winter, usually December. And not once had a victim's left hand ever been recovered.



Chris had struck twice more since 1962. The first was in 1966, when 10-year-old Zahim Al-Karim was found at Shooting Star Trails in a manner eerily similar to Jesse Booker. The second was in 1969, when 9-year-old Selaya Pierce was discovered in a scene so gruesome—centered around a Christmas tree—that I refuse to describe it further, out of basic human decency.



Little did I know at the time, but Ezra Calloway, 11 years old, taken on his way home from school on Wednesday, December 3rd, 1975, would become Chris’ fourth victim. I wouldn’t realise the truth until I got home that evening and saw a group of four women—yes, four people counted as a crowd in Hollow Creek—sitting on my front porch. Their eyes followed me as I trudged in from the cold, each one staring daggers at me.



"Can I help you?" I asked, confused, looking between the four women.



As soon as the words left my mouth, one of them yanked off her balaclava with the flair of a matador tossing a cape. It was Ezra’s mother, and the look of pure contempt she gave me made my stomach sink. I couldn’t shake the feeling that, in my attempt to be polite, I had somehow said the worst possible thing at the worst possible time.



"How dare you say that to me?" Mrs. Calloway scoffed, her voice trembling. "How DARE you say that to me?!"



Another woman, much older, stepped forward, placing a comforting hand on the shoulder of a third woman. Through the glare of the snow, I realized it was Joan, my neighbor. "She told us everything," the older woman said, her voice calm but accusatory, as Joan avoided my gaze.



"Dare I ask what she ‘told you’?" I replied, doing my best to mask the frustration rising in my chest.



“We know it was you,” the older woman said, her lips curling into a slight, knowing smirk, as if she’d just sprung a trap with a triumphant "Gotcha!"



It was then explained to me, in a dramatic fashion reminiscent of a *Perry Mason* courtroom bombshell, that Joan had recalled seeing ‘me’ returning home on the night Selaya Pierce went missing in '69. She claimed I was wearing a ski mask, dragging a large trash bag behind me, and glancing around as if searching for witnesses before hauling the hefty bag into my house.



"It all makes sense now," the older woman spat, her brow furrowing as rage simmered just beneath the surface. "You took little Selaya, YOU took Zahim, and YOU took my Jesse!"



I sighed, frustrated but trying to maintain my composure for my own rebuttal. "Firstly, Mrs. Booker," I began, keeping my tone as calm as possible despite my growing irritation, "I would’ve been just thirteen when your son... passed. As I recall, it was a *man* who abducted him."



Mrs. Booker scoffed, and I could already see the mental gymnastics beginning behind those hate-filled eyes. “To a boy my Jesse’s age,” she said, her voice dripping with venom, “a 13-year-old would be a man.”



I sighed. “And Mrs. Pierce,” I said, turning to the fourth woman, whose identity I had rightly guessed, “When was your daughter taken?”



“December 16th, 1969.”



“December 16th… really?” I groaned, realization hitting me. “I was on holiday leave then. I’ve got pictures to prove it.”



“Pictures?!” Mrs. Pierce scoffed. “Why should we believe your ‘pictures,’ you rat? We’ve got *eye-witness testimony*,” she snapped, emphasizing each word and patting Joan on the back with every syllable.



“I’m sorry,” I sighed, brushing past them as I stepped through the doorway. “I don’t have time for these baseless accusations. I truly am sorry for the tragedies that have befallen you all... but you’ve got the wrong man.”



"Don’t you dare close that door," Mrs. Pierce hissed, her voice sharp with fury. "You’re done. FINISHED! You’ve dug your own grave!" she screeched, but as soon as the word 'grave' left her mouth, her expression softened. The air suddenly grew still, the only sound left was the howling wind and the soft patter of snowflakes falling around us.



"... Goodbye." With that, I shut the door and slouched against the wall, utterly drained.



All through the night, I couldn't stop thinking about those women—the way their eyes bore into me, filled with certainty and resentment. Their words, thick with passion and accusation, echoed in my mind. By morning, I hadn’t slept a wink. I knew I wasn’t guilty, but I couldn’t shake the guilt gnawing at me. The way they spoke to me, the way they looked at me—it was overwhelming, far more than I expected to bear.



By the time I left for school the next morning, the thoughts still haunted me. As I walked through the snow-covered streets and beneath the looming trees, my mind drifted to Joan. I’d always liked Joan, and I thought we got along well. So why would she say those things about me? The question gnawed at me, the betrayal stinging more than I could have expected.



The more I walked, the more it gnawed at me, until I finally stopped to check my wristwatch. 7 o'clock. School wouldn’t start for another hour and a half. Maybe I should talk to Joan, hear it straight from her.



I turned on my heel, retracing my steps through the snow, until I found myself in front of Joan’s door. Without hesitation, I knocked.



“Yes?” Joan’s soft voice came as the door creaked open. Her face dropped when she saw me, and she quickly averted her gaze to the ground.

  


"I saw what I saw," she murmured, without me needing to say a word. I could tell she believed it—honest, but mistaken. She had to be, I reassured myself, glancing over my shoulder toward my house.



Then I froze.



My front door was wide open.



"Joan," I snapped, my heart racing, "Call Fayetteville. NOW."



"Excuse me?" Joan’s eyes finally met mine, confusion written all over her face.



"Joan, I mean it," I stammered. I knew I’d locked that door tight. But there it was—wide open, swinging in the snow’s glare. “Tell them there’s been a break-in at my place. I’ve got to go.”



Before Joan could respond, I was already sprinting back toward my house. In hindsight, I have no idea what I thought I’d accomplish. I wasn’t a vigilante or some Batman figure. Was I really going to confront an intruder and talk him into turning himself in? Maybe, deep down, I felt the need to make up for the terrible accusations thrown at me the night before. I’m not sure. But I ran inside—thoughtlessly, recklessly—ready for... well, I’m still not sure what.



As I burst through the doorway, my eyes adjusting from the blinding snow glare to the dim light of the hallway, all my bravado, my courage, drained away. I froze in place.



At the end of the hall stood a man, bigger and bulkier than me, poking at a ceiling tile with the end of a broomstick. He was tall, at least 6'2", wearing a scuffed corduroy jacket, bulky cargo pants, heavy boots, and a black ski mask.



"HEY!" I shouted instinctively. The man jumped, spun around, and suddenly I was staring down the barrel of a pistol.



“No, no, NO!” the man wailed, his voice muffled by the wool of his mask. His free hand tugged anxiously at the fabric of his faded 'The Doors' tee, his panic mounting with each pull.



Behind him, startling us both, the loose ceiling tile crashed to the floor. With it came several clear bags, their contents sloshing as they hit the ground. Inside, suspended in liquid, were small, lifeless hands—tiny, innocent hands, floating limply like goldfish won at a county fair.



"I never wanted you to see me like this!" the man shrieked, his voice cracking with sobs behind the mask. Like a child in the midst of a tantrum, he swung his arm and struck me hard across the jaw with the butt of the gun. I hit the floor, dazed.



"The cops are on the way, the cops are on the way!" I repeated frantically, hoping to stop him from doing anything even more reckless.



"You were supposed to be at school!" he bawled, pointing the gun at me again, his voice shaking. But just then, the distant wail of sirens began to grow louder. They must've been gunning it to get here from Fayetteville so quickly. Then again, in a place like this, I doubted they had much else to do. 



The man clearly heard the sirens too. He shot one last glance in my direction before bolting through the door and disappearing from sight. From my spot on the floor, I could faintly see Joan standing in her own doorway, eyes wide with fear. She pointed frantically toward the fleeing man as the approaching cop cars sped past her, heading in his direction.



Then, through the doorway, an officer stepped inside, extending a hand to help me off the floor.



"Are you alright, sir?"



"Yes, but… but…" I stammered, gesturing weakly toward the bags behind me. The officer’s eyes widened in horror as they locked onto their grotesque contents.



"All units, all units," the officer said, voice tense as he grabbed his radio, face pale. "Get back here, NOW."



"Copy," came a quiet response through the static, the urgency unmistakable.



It goes without saying, but I was horrified. The thought of those tiny hands up in my ceiling, for who knows how long, made my skin crawl. How many nights had I unknowingly walked right beneath them—eating a sandwich, grabbing the paper—without the slightest clue of the horrors floating just above my head, hidden from view?



Needless to say, I was cleared of suspicion by the police. They saw the other man, the bruises on my face, and the fingerprints all over the bags, the tile, and the walls—none of which matched mine. But the women? They never stopped believing. To them, it was all too convenient. Mrs. Booker even started claiming I’d hired some crook to stage the whole thing. 



I knew I couldn’t stay in that house, or even in Hollow Creek. By the next year, I’d moved out, but I still can’t shake the fear—always needing to check that the door is locked.



I thought I had finally moved on, years later. There were months where I didn’t even think about that nightmare. But as winter approaches, the air grows colder, and the snow begins to fall...



My mind drifts back to Chris.
