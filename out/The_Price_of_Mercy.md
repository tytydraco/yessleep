Part 1: The Good Neighbor

Michael Reeves was the best neighbor anyone could ask for. He mowed Mrs. Henderson's lawn every Sunday. He drove Mr. Parker to his chemotherapy appointments. He tutored the Wilson kids in math. He even organized the neighborhood watch program.

That's why no one questioned it when he started taking in the stray cats.

It began after his wife's death. "It helps with the loneliness," he'd say, smiling that gentle smile of his. Within months, he had taken in nearly every stray in the neighborhood. People actually thanked him for solving their feral cat problem.

Detective Anna Martinez wouldn't have given it a second thought either, if it weren't for the filing error that landed a missing persons report on her desk. Six cities. Six neighborhoods. Six "model citizens" who took in strays. And in each case, children started disappearing a few months later.

But never from the immediate neighborhood. Always from the areas just beyond, where people wouldn't make the connection.

The first body was found three hundred miles away. A seven-year-old boy, perfectly preserved, posed as if sleeping. The coroner said he'd never seen anything like it. The body hadn't decomposed at all, but all the blood had been replaced with something else. Something that kept the tissues fresh.

The second body turned up two states over. Same signature. Same preservation. Same impossible bloodless condition.

Anna knew she should call for backup as she parked outside Michael's house at 2 AM. But she couldn't risk a full operation, not without proof. Not when Michael Reeves was so beloved, so trusted. Not when he'd just been awarded the Community Service Award by the mayor himself.

The house was dark except for the basement windows. A faint blue light pulsed from below, like a gentle heartbeat. As she approached, she heard purring. Not from one or two cats. From dozens. The sound vibrated through the ground beneath her feet.

The basement door was unlocked. It always was. Michael Reeves had nothing to hide, after all. He was the good neighbor. The kind man who helped everyone.

The stairs creaked under her feet. The purring grew louder. Hundreds of eyes reflected her flashlight beam—cats perched on every surface, watching her descent. But they weren't moving. They weren't blinking. They just... watched.

The basement was immaculate. Shelves lined with jars of clear liquid. A steel table in the center. And the walls... the walls were covered in photographs. Children smiling. Playing. Sleeping. Each photo labeled with a date and a single word: "Preserved."

"They were suffering, you know."

Michael's voice behind her was still gentle. Still kind. She turned to find him standing at the foot of the stairs, holding another child in his arms. A boy, maybe six years old, seemingly asleep.

"Their parents hurt them. Neglected them. I watched through my little friends." He gestured to the cats, their eyes still fixed, unblinking. "They show me everything. All the pain. All the fear. So I preserve them at their happiest moment. Keep them safe. Perfect. Forever."

The cats began to move. Not like cats should move. Their bodies twisted, elongated, flowing together like mercury.

"The children never feel a thing," Michael continued, stroking the boy's hair. "The process is painless. The cats take their blood, replace it with the preservation fluid. Such a simple exchange. Such a mercy."

Anna raised her gun, but her hand was shaking. Because Michael was still smiling that kind smile. Because even now, she could see why everyone trusted him. Why they let him into their homes, their lives.

"Would you like to see how it works?" he asked. "I have room for one more. And you look so tired, Detective Martinez. So burdened by all the suffering you've seen."

The cats were almost to her feet now, their bodies rippling like liquid metal, their purring reverberating in her bones.

"Don't worry," Michael whispered, his kind eyes shining in the dark. "Everyone looks so peaceful when I'm done. Like they're just having a pleasant dream."

The lights went out.

The purring grew louder.

And in the darkness, Anna Martinez finally understood why Michael Reeves was considered the perfect neighbor.

He just wanted everyone to be happy.

Forever.

Part 2: The Colony

Anna Martinez woke up in her own bed with a splitting headache and a text message from Michael Reeves: "I'm sorry you had to see that. But now you're part of it."

Her gun was on the nightstand, unfired. Her clothes were clean, no sign of struggle. But her body felt wrong, like her skin had been removed and put back on incorrectly.

And there was a cat sitting at the foot of her bed. Pure white, unblinking, watching her with eyes that reflected light that wasn't there.

The events of the previous night came flooding back: the basement, the photographs, the children... and the cats. The impossible cats that moved like liquid metal. She grabbed her phone to call for backup, but stopped when she saw the screen's reflection.

Behind the white cat were now three more. They hadn't made a sound. Hadn't moved. They had simply... appeared.

Her phone buzzed: "They'll follow you now. They follow all of us who know. Don't worry – they're just making sure you understand your part in this."

She tried to take a photo of the cats. Her camera showed an empty room.

Another text: "Check your email. I sent you something that might help explain."

The email contained a single video file. Her hands shook as she pressed play.

It was surveillance footage from a children's hospital. A cancer ward. She recognized it – she'd investigated a case there last year. A terminal patient had miraculously recovered overnight, while another child in the same ward had vanished without a trace.

The timestamp showed 2 AM. A nurse was doing her rounds when one of Michael's liquid-metal cats slipped into the room. It flowed onto the bed of a dying child, its form rippling as it...

Anna slammed the laptop shut.

More texts appeared:

"You saw what they can do. How they can transfer life itself. One child's suffering traded for another's salvation."

"But the process isn't perfect. It needs architects. Guardians. People like me in every city, keeping the balance."

"That's why I let you live, Detective. You have the perfect cover to help us. To choose which ones need preserving. Which ones deserve saving."

The white cat on her bed stretched, its form momentarily losing coherence, becoming a silvery puddle before reforming. Now it had Michael's eyes.

Her phone buzzed one last time: "Check your basement."

Anna ran downstairs, her heart pounding. The basement door was open. Blue light pulsed from below.

The walls were lined with empty preservation jars.

Waiting to be filled.

A child's laughter echoed from upstairs. When she turned around, the stairs were filled with cats. Hundreds of them. All with Michael's eyes.

And all of them were smiling.
