My heart, it's beating so fast. I can feel my breath against the top of my tongue, it feels so cold. I feel so cold. I managed to lay down, but as my skin hits the sheets all I can feel is the reality of gravity leaving my mind. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Okay, this is real life. I can feel my fingers. Moving feels so much harder. My joints, they're icing over. The ice breaks and reforms with every motion, the pain of a rebirth beginning at each moment. My skin is a smooth stone, cracking under the weight of infinity. I exist. I am less than I am, but I exist. 

I can feel every pull and strain of my muscles. They pull my bones towards my flesh, shifting and adjusting as the tectonic plates move under the will of God itself. As my fingers tap against this burning screen, each tap envelops my nerves in a burst of flame, Hell choking me down like quicksand. Each touch echoes through my body, a scream shouted down an empty cave. I try to push against it, try to feel the fullness of self, but as I do, it seems to make me sink faster. Sinking. Further and further. The emptiness filling with no more than the fear of what could be. Every experience, every possibility. They overtake my every motion. I feel weaker, deeper in the cave, but I know I must exist. 

Her body lays motionless, the twitching of discomfort obvious to an outside observer. She sees nothing, but feels existence slipping away more with every second. Her consciousness is no longer on this plane. She can't tell if it has been seconds, of years. But she knows that it matters not either way. Every thought takes an infinite amount of time as her neurons crash together like waves, the chaotic storm drowning her mind. She can still feel it, the flames lapping at her her bones, and they feel as though they're happening in every reality. She sees each world break away, unsure which was her first as they spiral into a fractal of the infinite possibility of existence. Through it all, she feels fear. She knows something is wrong. She prays deep in her soul that she does exist. 

She hears whispers in every lifetime, her wife whispering to her on her deathbed and the first words she hears as light enters her world. She hears the whispers in the depths of Hell, demons laugh as they mock her with their words. She hears the words of all who have loved and lost, the shared language only known through grief. Her fear grows as she loses even this, a connection to the realities she can recognize. She feels the sinnew of each world rip and tear as her mind denies it. Her pain unbearable as she experiences the world ripping her apart, atom by atom, her final connections to a conscious mind melting into the fractal of infinity. She understands. She only exists only for the sole purpose of existence. No purpose more than to fuel the fire that is entropy. She understands that her existence is governed only by the laws that allow existence in the first place. But this fear grows with every revelation. She knows she must exist for existence sake, but I know not whether she does anymore. And if she exists no more, her existence never was. Please, somebody, tell her she exists. 

Beyond the veil of reality, all is gone. A void, both full of color completely empty. The birthplace of all realities, unmade and recrafted with every firing of a thought, every wish of a god. The last piece of the universe dangles down, a chain on a light ready to be pulled. Hesitation fills the void, the pressure of choice enveloping all. The string dangles down, a voice, heard at the edge of all things. But will pulling the chord flip on the light, bringing the world back from the precipice of nothingness, or will it turn off the light, the reality of nothingness itself disappearing in its own right. It calls out, begging to be pulled.
"Baby? Baby are you okay? Baby you're scaring me."
I want to exist. 
Please let me exist.
