Hey guys, first time poster here, I only thought about this recently, and I really had to dig it up. After watching a bunch of Reddit scary story reading videos, I felt that something unsettling and weird had happened to me in the past, but I couldn’t place my finger on it. I thought for a few minutes and the first thing that came to my mind was a big red house in the middle of the forest. Then the rest came flooding back.

I was a lot younger at the time, probably around 7 or 8 when this occurred. I had been playing around with rollerblades with my friend in my grandma’s driveway when I suggested that we go to this cool hangout spot in the forest. It’s on a path where you walk along just inside the tree line and then make a left and there’s a concrete tube to sit on and chill. Me and my cousins used to go there when we were bored and wanted to do our own thing separate from the adults. 

Being the impatient, immature child I was, I decided that I didn’t need to take off my rollerblades despite the uselessness and even hindrance they would pose out there. My friend on the other hand, had a lot more sense and put shoes on, while he was inside I told him to ask his brother if he wanted to come. He was also my friend, but he said he wasn’t feeling up to it. I swear these details are important. When we got out there (it wasn’t very far) it didn’t take long for us to become bored and play games. We played hide and seek, tag, and other miscellaneous games before we decided to walk further into the forest. We got to a point where the path split off on the left perpendicular to the main path. I take a few heavy steps with my rollerblades and then feel my feet sink. I stepped in mud.

With my favorite rollerblades drenched with mud and my socks a little wet we continue on carefully. Eventually we happen upon a clearing. In the middle of the clearing there was a big red house. I say that, but it didn’t seem to serve as a house. It was very wide and long but not very tall. I was an average sized 7 or 8 year old and I could reach on my tippy toes and look through the window on the door. It was holding a bunch of random stuff that I really couldn’t make out despite looking for a long time. All I knew was that there was an unsettling amount of clutter in there. Seeing as though we were in the middle of the forest it didn’t seem like the most likely place for storage. I stepped aside to let my friend look, and after looking for a only a few seconds he jumped away from the door and said “we need to leave”. He was taller than me and could get a better look than me, so I don’t know if I couldn’t see it or just didn’t but he never told me what “it” was, no matter how many times I would ask. After looking around for a bit, a realization hit us like a freight train, the big clearing was a circle, and the brush was a little thick leading up to it. We didn’t know our way back.

After a while of panicking, we came up with a plan. We start at the same spot and walk in opposite directions until we found where we came in. Not long into this plan did we come to find that it was useless. Not because it wouldn’t work, but because we heard what sounded like his brother’s voice coming from the edge of the forest line. We followed his voice assuming he had come out to find us after we had been out for a while. His voice did lead us back to the trail, but we never saw him. We walked our way back, unsettled and uncomfortable, until we made our way back to the house. When we got there, we asked his brother if he remembers going out and screaming for us. He said no. Me and my friend looked at each other with terror on our faces. I distinctly remember his brother’s voice, we didn’t understand what he was saying, but we both agreed it sounded just like him.

My grandmother was not very pleased to find my rollerblades covered in mud. She scolded me, but told me that it will wash off and that I should be more careful with them. Although, being a kid, I was just as impatient as I was lazy. I never really got around to cleaning my rollerblades. I specifically remember them staying dirty for a very long time and I also remember thinking about the red house in the middle of the forest every time I saw them.

After a while I asked my friend if he remembered the encounter. He said he did not remember. I explained everything I remembered and he told me he remembered going into the forest, but didn’t remember a red house, or me stepping in mud, or hearing his “brother’s” voice. I asked him how could he forget, seeing as though he’s the one that encouraged me to leave because he saw something in there. He said I was losing my mind.

As time passed on the mud flaked off of my rollerblades, and so too did the memory flake out of my mind. I didn’t think of this for almost 10 years until just the other day. After seeing some Reddit videos on YouTube about scary stories, I had a hunch that I had one of those stories too. It took so long to come to me, but when I remembered it, I was so unsettled, I thought “how could I forget?” Although, not 10 minutes ago, after seeing similar videos, did that tip of my tongue feeling come back. With only a day or two in between now and when I first thought about it, I had completely forgotten, until I remembered the red house, and once again, it all came flooding back. 

My brain seems to want to forget this completely, and yet I will not let it. Even though it worked on everyone else. There’s so many questions and absolutely no answers, but all I know is that whatever was out there I was not supposed to see.
