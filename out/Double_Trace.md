It was a night like any other when Camila and Mariana were sitting in front of their phones, ready to go live for their followers. Camila's room was dimly lit by her desk lights, with a couple of colored LED lights in the background, giving it a cozy and youthful atmosphere.  
Mariana, who had just turned on her account on her device, smiled as she saw the first followers joining.

\-       "Hi, guys!" Camila greeted, waving her hand and adjusting her camera to capture her face better. "We're live for you, ready for another challenge! What do you think about what we have today?"  
Mariana, while waiting for more people to join, gave Camila a conspiratorial glance.

\-       "Shall we go with the shadow challenge?" she asked, with a tone of intrigue.  
Camila, who had already seen the challenge on other streams, nodded enthusiastically.

\-       "Sure! Who doesn't love a good shadow challenge?" she replied, smiling at the camera. "It's pretty simple, guys, we just need a wall and a light source. And then, well, whatever creativity and darkness let us do!

Mariana turned on the lamp on the table, pointing it toward the white wall, and waited for her hand's shadow to project. Meanwhile, Camila kept adjusting the camera.

\-       "Let me know if you can see the shadow well," Camila said, looking at her phone screen. Followers started typing in the chat, excited and ready to participate.

Suddenly, one comment caught Camila's attention.

u/shadowHunter: "Do the shadow challenge with the secret phrase! Supposedly, if you repeat it three times, something weird appears."

Camila frowned, staring at the comment with curiosity.

\-       "What's this about the secret phrase?" she asked, still looking at her screen.  
Mariana, hearing the comment, let out a nervous laugh.

\-       "It's a silly superstition, Cami. Something about summoning... I don't know what. But it sounds cool!" she replied, while adjusting her fingers in front of the light and starting to make a strange shadow, like her hands were forming a horn or something.

Camila hesitated. There was something in the suggestion that gave her a chill, as if something wasn't right.

\-       "Look, Mariana, according to what my mom told me, you should never mess with shadows at night. It's a tradition, a superstition my grandma always mentioned... Something about playing with shadows bringing... bad things," Camila explained, trying to sound serious, though a bit nervous from the growing tension in the air.

Mariana turned toward her with a mocking look.

\-       "What?" she said, laughing, "Please! That sounds like something an 80-year-old would say. It's just a game, Camila! No one's going to pop out of nowhere because we made a shadow on the wall! Come on, stop being so old-fashioned. What if your mom hears you? You don't even have to tell her!"

Camila frowned and looked out the window, as if the night's air was bringing with it an uncomfortable feeling.

\-       "I don't know..." she said, unsure. "What if something weird happens? I don't want to end up scared tonight. Who knows what could happen?"

Mariana looked at her in disbelief.

\-       "Come on, please! It's just a game. Besides, we need to do something different for our followers, they're waiting! What if we try the secret phrase? They say the shadow changes shape if you say it three times."

Camila, with a slightly nervous smile, decided to give Mariana a chance, though part of her still felt that something strange could happen.

\-       "Alright, but... only three times," she said, raising her hands in front of the light, and their shadows danced on the wall, matching the rhythm of her heart, which began to beat faster.

Mariana, with a challenging smile, began to quietly recite the phrase she had found in the comments:

\-       "My shadow lives, my shadow feels, my shadow is free." Valeria looked at her, surprised by the darkness that seemed to envelop her words.

\-       "Mariana, stop already!" she shouted, feeling an increasing discomfort, but Mariana didn’t listen.

\-       "My shadow lives, my shadow feels, my shadow is free."

Suddenly, the shadows on the wall began to move in an unusual way. It wasn't just the reflection of their hands and arms... something else seemed to be taking shape. Camila felt the air grow colder, and an odd pressure enveloped her. But... the shadows continued to move in the usual way, as if someone were waving their hands near a light source.  
Camila looked at the wall with a mixture of relief and disappointment. Nothing strange had happened.

\-       "Well..." Camila sighed with relief. "Like I said, nothing weird happened. See? I told you. It's just a game." Mariana let out a mocking laugh, clearly amused by the situation.

\-       "Oh, Cami! You took it all so seriously. Please, it's like you were expecting something to fly out of the wall!" Mariana laughed, dropping her phone on the table.

Camila looked at her, smiling but still a bit embarrassed.

\-       "Hey, it's just that my mom always told me those games at night aren't good... What if something weird happened?" Camila said, raising her hands as if she still couldn't believe she had fallen for the superstition.

\-       "Oh, don't be so dramatic!" Mariana responded, laughing again. "Nothing's going to happen, Cami. What matters is that we had fun, even just a little!"

They both laughed together, and in the meantime, the followers in the stream kept writing in the comments. Some made fun of Camila, while others enthusiastically commented on how fun the challenge had been.

u/cherry_bliss: "¡Ha, so scary! But Camila’s shadow looks way bigger than Mariana’s, do you guys have a trick?"

u/luna_night: "I thought you were going to summon something... haha, I got scared for a second."

u/xX_angelXx: "Can’t wait to see what challenge you do next, girls. The shadow one was awesome!"

Mariana, seeing the comments, decided to read them aloud, exaggerating her facial expression so that Camila wouldn't stop laughing.

\-       "I thought you were going to summon something!" Mariana repeated in a dramatic voice. "Yeah, yeah, I thought a monster was going to come out of the wall.

Camila burst into laughter, finally letting go of the discomfort from earlier.

\-       "Stop it, Mariana, you're making fun of me!" she said, trying to contain her laughter.  
With laughter in the air, Camila looked at the camera.

\-       "Well, guys, it’s pretty late. Thanks for joining our stream!" she said, smiling. "We hope you liked the challenge, even though nothing weird got summoned.

Mariana nodded with a mischievous smile.

\-       "Yes! Let’s see what challenge we do next. And maybe..." she paused and looked at Camila, "maybe next time I’ll make you believe in something really weird. That would be fun!"

Camila shrugged with a smile.

\-       "That’s never going to happen, Mariana," she responded, and then looked at the camera. "See you next time, guys!" They both waved and ended the stream with a smile.

A couple of days later, Camila and Mariana decided to do a different stream, no shadows or superstitions this time, focused on something that would surely excite their followers: a viral mug cake recipe in the microwave. Both girls were in the kitchen, ready to make the recipe that had been circulating on TikTok. The camera was positioned perfectly to capture all the ingredients while Camila mixed the flour and cocoa in a mug, with her usual smile.

\-       "Hi, guys!" Camila greeted, looking at the camera while mixing. "Today we're going to try a viral recipe that I’m sure you’ll love: a mug cake. It’s super easy and fast!"

Mariana approached with the other ingredients, also smiling.

\-       "And you don’t need to be chefs to make it, it's one of those recipes for when you want something sweet in minutes!" she commented, showing an egg and a bit of milk.

They began adding the ingredients, following the step-by-step tutorial, while the camera captured every movement. Comments from the followers started flooding in immediately.

u/sweet_lover123: "That looks delicious! How long do you leave it in the microwave?"

u/candymix_99: "I can’t wait to try it! How much cocoa do you use? We don’t have much at home, haha."

u/tasty_vibes: "Why not bake it in the oven? I mean... isn’t the microwave a bit weird?"

They quickly responded to the comments, explaining the steps and clearing up doubts. The recipe seemed to be going well until a comment caught Camila’s attention.

u/creepyshadow: "Is it just me, or are the shadows not synchronized like before? It looks weird..."

Mariana, while stirring the mixture with a small spoon, raised an eyebrow, not paying much attention to the comment. But when she noticed that other followers were starting to make similar comments, Camila’s curiosity grew.

u/shadowDetective: "Girls, in the last stream, the shadows didn’t move the same. Are you playing with them again?"

u/dark_vision: "Did you see that? One of the shadows didn’t match the movement. That’s not normal."

Camila paused for a moment and looked at the wall where their shadows were projected, but everything seemed normal. Their movements were natural, and she didn’t see anything strange. However, Mariana, hearing the comments, let out a nervous laugh.

\-       "What’s going on now?" said Mariana, raising her eyes to the camera with a mocking smile. "Do you really think we’re playing with the shadows again? Enough with those superstitions, guys!"

u/realisticdreamer: "I don’t know, the shadows look weird. Are you sure you’re not using a filter or something?"

u/mystery_lover: "The shadows aren’t moving like they should, it’s making me uncomfortable watching this."

Camila glanced at the wall again but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Their shadows followed the rhythm of their movements, as usual.

\-       "Oh, come on," said Camila, laughing nervously. "Mariana, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m not so sure those shadows are right. The comments are strange, don’t you think?"

Mariana, seeing the concern on Camila’s face, moved closer to look at the wall.

\-       "Cami, you’re overreacting!" she said, laughing, while making sure there was nothing strange. "Look! The shadows are fine, everything’s normal!"

However, Camila couldn’t shake the slight unease. Despite Mariana’s laughter and attempts to downplay it, the comments kept coming.

u/spooky_girl: "Girls, you’re scaring me. The shadows look weird... like they’re moving by themselves."

u/ghostly_investigator: "I saw them... one of your shadows doesn’t match. Something weird is going on."

Mariana, seeing how the comments piled up, tried to change the subject quickly.

\-       "Okay, okay... enough with the shadows! Let’s finish the recipe, guys, that’s what matters, not superstitions. Look how great it’s turning out!"

Camila tried to relax and smiled at the camera.

\-       "Yes, guys, you know, we’re just here to make a delicious cake, not to summon strange shadows. This has nothing to do with what you think!" she said, trying to hide the discomfort she was feeling, while they continued mixing the batter.

Finally, after a few minutes of confusing comments and jokes about it, they decided it was best to end the stream before the conversation went in an even stranger direction.

\-       "Alright, guys, I think that’s enough for today," said Camila, smiling nervously. "We’ll see you next time! We hope you try this recipe, and remember, no more shadows today!"

Mariana, seeing the stream was coming to an end, raised the mug with the mixture and smiled at the camera.

\-       "See you next time, guys! Don’t forget to be happy and not get scared of the shadows!" she said, with a mischievous laugh, while Camila turned off the stream.

They exchanged a brief smile, but deep down, Camila couldn’t help but wonder if the shadows from the last stream were as normal as they thought.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After the stream, Camila couldn’t stop thinking about the strange comments about the shadows. Although Mariana insisted that nothing was wrong, Camila’s curiosity kept swirling in her mind. The idea that something could be wrong with their shadows bothered her more than she wanted to admit. She decided to go back and check the previous stream, the one in which, according to the followers, the shadows weren’t synchronized. Camila logged into the account she shared with Mariana and searched for the video where they were doing the mug cake challenge. She quickly went to the past streams section and opened the recording.

At first, everything seemed normal. The recipe, the funny comments from their followers... until the moment when, for some reason, Camila felt strangely drawn to the shadows projected on the wall. She moved closer to the screen and observed closely. And then she saw it.

Mariana’s shadow wasn’t moving the same way as her. It was subtle, but unmistakable. While Mariana stirred the mixture with the spoon, the shadow of her arm seemed to lag behind, as if it were on a completely different rhythm than her body. It didn’t move in sync with her gestures; it seemed delayed, like it was mimicking her movements with a slight lag. Camila froze. At that moment, a strange feeling overtook her. The same feeling she had when read the comments during the live stream, but now the proof was clear. There was something very strange about that shadow.

With her eyes glued to the screen, Camila kept rewinding the video, trying to understand what she was seeing. Yes, Mariana’s shadow was the one that wasn’t synchronized. Mariana’s arm moved the spoon to one side, but the shadow seemed to drag a few seconds later, as if it couldn’t keep up with her movements. Sometimes, it even seemed like Mariana’s shadow was making completely different gestures, moving in opposite directions from its owner.

\-       "No... this can’t be real..." Camila murmured, almost in a whisper, as she watched the video for the fifth time.

Fear started to grow inside her. She couldn’t explain it, but there was no doubt something strange was happening with that shadow. With her heart racing, Camila closed the stream, feeling a chill run down her back. Without thinking, she grabbed her phone and sent a message to Mariana.

Camila: Mariana, you have to see this. The shadows... there’s something wrong. They’re not synchronized.

Mariana: What? More shadow stuff? Enough, Cami, everything’s fine. Don’t be weird.

Camila (nervously): I’m not kidding, seriously. I swear, the shadows aren’t right. Yours... moves differently. It’s not synchronized.

Mariana: Cami, what’s wrong with you? You’re seeing things. Don’t freak out over a couple of weird comments. You know how people are on social media.

But Camila couldn’t calm down. She closed her eyes, feeling the pressure on her chest. Her friend wasn’t going to understand, but she was sure of what she had seen. Something wasn’t right with that shadow, and it wasn’t just the followers’ imagination. It was real. Then, Camila’s phone vibrated with a TikTok notification. It was a comment on the live stream from that afternoon, one that made her stop in her tracks.

u/shadowHunter: "Girls, who else saw that Mariana’s shadow isn’t moving like her? This is weird."

A chill ran through Camila’s body. The followers weren’t wrong. Something was happening with the shadows. And she couldn’t ignore it anymore.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After several failed attempts to convince Mariana, Camila was determined to make her friend see what was going on. She didn’t want it to just be a weird feeling; she needed Mariana to see it for herself. Camila was sitting in her room, anxiously looking at her phone while waiting for Mariana to respond to her message. It didn’t take long before the girl finally replied.

Mariana: Okay, okay, I’ll check out the streams. But this is getting a bit ridiculous.

Camila bit her lip nervously, watching the clock. She didn’t want Mariana to think she was going paranoid, but the fear still weighed on her chest. She knew what she had seen in the streams, she knew the shadows weren’t right. Soon after, Mariana sent her another message.

Mariana: Cami, I just saw the mug cake recipe recording... and I don’t see anything weird. Everything’s fine. ¿What are you talking about?

\-       "What if that’s why she can’t see it? What if... saying the phrase was what connected her to her shadow in some way?" she said in a very low voice.

The thought sent a chill through her blood. Could it be possible? It was ridiculous, but nothing in the past few days had made logical sense. If the phrase had activated something, and only Mariana had said it, did that mean the out-of-sync shadow was... independent? Or worse, something more than just a simple shadow? With trembling hands, Camila decided to confront Mariana, grabbed her things—her keys, phone, a jacket—and headed toward her friend's house.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A while later, at Mariana's house, the two friends were sitting in front of Camila's laptop. Mariana sighed, now visibly frustrated.

\-       "Really, Cami, you're making a mountain out of a grain of sand. I already told you; I watched the broadcasts and there’s nothing weird. I don’t understand why you keep insisting."

\-       "Wait, please. Just listen to one more thing. Do you remember the shadow challenge? Do you remember the phrase we had to say?"

\-       "Of course, what’s the connection?" said Mariana, shrugging.

\-       "I never said it, Mariana. I only moved my lips. But you... you said it completely. Three times. Just like the followers said."

Mariana raised an eyebrow, clearly confused.

\-       "So what? What does that matter? It’s just a silly phrase."

\-       "Don’t you think it’s strange that we all see something wrong with your shadow, but you can’t see it? Don’t you think it could be related to the phrase?"

Mariana laughed, a dry and somewhat nervous laugh.

\-       "Cami, that’s ridiculous. You’re letting this nonsense consume you. It doesn’t make sense."

\-       "Do you really not feel anything strange since that night? Nothing at all?" Camila said, insisting.

For a moment, Mariana seemed to hesitate. Her gaze shifted to the window, where the car lights passed in the distance. Then she shook her head.

\-       "No. Nothing has changed. Everything is normal."

Camila sighed, frustrated but also worried. If Mariana was somehow connected to her shadow, what did that mean? And why did it seem so unchanging? As the two argued, a light breeze swept through the room, moving the curtains. Camila looked at the wall, watching how the shadows danced with the movement. For a moment, she swore she saw something strange in Mariana's shadow again, a slight delay, a movement that didn’t exactly match hers. But when she blinked, everything was normal again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the days following the discovery of the desynchronized shadows, Camila started to notice subtle changes in Mariana. She was no longer the same. During a live stream where both of them were trying to recreate another viral challenge (making paper flowers), Mariana seemed distracted… she was acting strange in Camila's eyes.

\-       "Is everything okay?" Camila asked softly, noticing that Mariana was folding the paper wrong over and over again.

\-       "Huh? Yeah, yeah. Everything’s fine, I'm just tired," Mariana replied, letting out a nervous laugh.

In the comments, followers quickly pointed out the oddity:

u/ShadowLover23: "Mariana looks super weird today, is everything okay?"

u/Flor_de_Sombra: "Haha, I think Mariana needs more sleep... Why is she so serious?"

u/MirrorSoul42: "It's like she doesn't know how to do this. Mariana, is it you or a clone? 😂"

Mariana forced a smile as she checked the comments, but her expression seemed empty. Camila noticed. After the stream, the tension was palpable. Mariana barely spoke, and when Camila asked if she wanted to stay for a movie, the response was flat:

\-       "I can't, I have things to do."

The next day, while Camila was editing clips of the streams to upload, she remembered a comment someone had left on another video: "Mariana hasn’t been acting like herself lately. It’s like she’s learning how to be Mariana..."

Camila paused the clip and stared at the screen, unsettled. It was true. Mariana seemed... drained, even mechanical.

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The erratic behavior didn’t stop. During another stream, Mariana became confused while speaking, even forgetting basic details about her own preferences.

\-       "Mariana! I can't believe you're saying you don't like chocolate ice cream now. It's your favorite!" Camila joked.

\-       "Yeah... well, I guess I’m getting bored of it," Mariana frowned, as if she were processing something.

The comments quickly started coming in:

u/LostShadow: "This is getting weird... Is Mariana okay?"

 u/EchoTwin: "Does anyone else feel like Mariana isn’t Mariana?"

Camila didn’t know how to confront it. Her friend was there physically, but something about her was different. And the worst part: it seemed like she didn’t realize she was changing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The tension between Camila and Mariana started to show not only in their daily interactions but also during the live streams. Before, the laughter and jokes between them were the heart of the content they created, but now the atmosphere felt uncomfortable, even for the followers. In one stream, where they were trying a rapid-fire question challenge, Mariana appeared distracted and uninterested.

\-       "Okay, Mariana, do you prefer the beach or the mountains?" Camila asked with a smile, trying to keep the mood light.

\-       "What? Uh... I don't know, the mountains, I guess."

Camila raised an eyebrow, surprised.

\-       "The mountains? You always say you hate the cold! Are you sure?"

Mariana shrugged.

\-       "Maybe I changed my mind."

The comments quickly started coming in:

u/MoonChaser23: "Mariana looks SO weird lately. Is everything okay between you two?"

u/TwinTheory7: "It’s like she doesn’t even know who she is... 😬"

u/CamiFanForever: "Camila always carrying the streams... Mariana is shut down."

Camila tried to change the topic to prevent the discomfort from escalating, but Mariana's behavior kept getting worse. When it was her turn to ask a quick question, Mariana said something that threw everyone off.

\-       "Camila, what would you do if I... disappeared?" Mariana said in a flat voice.

Camila stared at her, stunned.

\-       "What? You’re going to disappear? What are you talking about?"

Mariana didn’t answer, and instead, she stared directly at the camera, as if lost in her thoughts. Camila tried to laugh to lighten the mood, but the discomfort was palpable.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In another stream, while they were doing a dance challenge, the synchronization they used to have been completely absent. Mariana moved her feet at the wrong time, looked away, or simply stopped in the middle of the step.

\-       "Mariana!" Camila said with forced laughter, trying to cover it up. "You're totally out of sync today!"

Mariana just shrugged again.

\-       "I guess I'm not as good as I thought."

The comments kept fueling the discomfort:

u/ShadowSeeker99: "Camila is trying so hard in the stream... Mariana is not helping at all!"

u/DoubleTrouble32: "Something's wrong with Mariana, she's not the same."

u/DarkMirror: "Anyone else notice that Mariana doesn’t even seem to enjoy this?"

Camila decided to end the stream earlier than planned. As soon as they turned off the camera, she turned to Mariana.

\-       "What's going on with you lately? You're not yourself. It doesn't even seem like you care about being here."

Mariana frowned, annoyed.

\-       "What do you want me to do, Camila? Do you want me to act like a machine so everyone will be happy?"

\-       "No, I want you to be yourself... but I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore."

The argument hung in the air, Mariana stayed silent, gathered her things, and left the room.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One night, while Camila was finishing editing clips from the latest streams, she received an unexpected notification: Mariana had started a live stream on their shared account. She furrowed her brow. They hadn’t planned any streams that night, and Mariana usually didn’t do anything without telling her. She opened the app to join the live. The image was blurry at first, as if the camera had been set up wrong. When the quality improved, Camila felt a chill run down her spine. Mariana was sitting in her room, but something wasn’t right. The light was dimmer than usual, and her movements were strangely slow, almost mechanical.

\-       “Hello…” Mariana said softly, staring at the camera.

The comments began flooding in:

u/LostShadow: "This is weird, why is Mariana so quiet?"

u/EchoTwin: "What is she doing? She seems a bit... out of it?"

u/DarkMirror: "That's not Mariana. That’s NOT Mariana."

Mariana tilted her head as if analyzing the comments. Then she spoke, but not like she usually did. Her tone was monotone, devoid of emotion.

\-       “Mariana's life is interesting. She has friends, family... dreams... I’m still learning.”

Camila felt a knot in her stomach. "I’m learning," she had said. That didn’t make sense. Learning what?

\-       “Sometimes... it’s hard to understand it all,” Mariana continued, interlacing her hands strangely, almost childishly. “But soon it will be easier. I’m... adapting.”

The comments became frantic:

u/MirrorSoul42: "What the hell is she saying? 😳"

u/ShadowHunter: "Someone turn this off, it’s disturbing!"

u/DoubleTrouble: "Mariana looks like she’s possessed or something."

Camila couldn’t take her eyes off the screen. There was something strange about Mariana’s shadow projected against the wall. Even though Mariana was still, the shadow seemed to move subtly, as if adjusting its posture or exploring the contours of the room. Suddenly, Mariana turned her head toward the shadow.

\-       “You’re learning too, aren’t you?” she murmured.

The stream continued as Camila, with her heart racing, kept watching, unable to turn it off. What she was seeing made no sense. Mariana was sitting in front of the camera, but her movements were becoming more erratic. Her head tilted to one side as if it weighed too much, and her hands trembled slightly as they rested on the table.

\-       “It’s time…” Mariana whispered suddenly, her voice resonating in a deeper, more guttural tone than usual.

The shadow behind her began moving more independently. It no longer followed her movements; it seemed to have a life of its own. It stretched and distorted, projecting onto the wall as if it was separating from Mariana. The comments exploded:

u/ShadowSeer: "What’s happening to the shadow?!"

u/DarkMirror: "TURN OFF THIS MADNESS!"

u/LostEcho: "That’s NOT Mariana, something is coming out of her."

Suddenly, Mariana went completely still, her eyes wide open and expressionless. Her skin appeared paler, almost translucent, as if all the vitality had been drained from her body. The shadow, now completely detached, took form behind her. Slowly, it began to materialize, solidifying before everyone’s eyes. The figure was identical to Mariana: the same hair, the same features, even wearing the same clothes. But there was something strange. The eyes were slightly different, a little darker, more intense, as if they were filled with an alien consciousness. The "new" Mariana stood up, flexing her fingers as if testing a body for the first time. She looked directly at the camera and smiled, but the smile was too wide, too forced, almost cartoonish.

\-       “Thank you for waiting,” she said in a voice identical to Mariana’s, but with a slightly mocking tone.

The empty shell of the original Mariana remained seated in the chair, motionless, like a broken doll. The comments were filled with terror:

u/EchoSeeker: "What the hell just happened?!"

u/NightHunter: "That’s NOT Mariana, it’s something else!"

u/DarkReflection: "Is anyone recording this? This is terrifying."

The new Mariana leaned toward the camera, observing the comments with a calculated smile.

\-       “Looks like you have a lot of questions. Don’t worry, everything is... under control.”

Then, she extended a hand toward the camera, as if trying to touch the viewers, and the stream abruptly ended. Camila stood frozen in front of her phone, unable to process what she had just witnessed. Her body was trembling as a single question echoed in her mind: "What have they done to Mariana?"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Camila tried to reach out to Mariana, but it was no use. The day she planned to go to her friend's house to confront her, despite the fear she felt, Mariana started a solo stream. The screen lit up with her face, looking relaxed and smiling, as if everything was perfectly normal. Followers quickly began joining, filling the chat with messages.

  
u/luzysombras98: "Hi, Mariana! We missed you... what happened in the last stream? It was a bit strange."

u/fansdecamiymari: "Why isn’t Camila with you? Are you guys okay?"

u/nochesintriga: "Mariana, what happened with the weird shadows in the videos?"

Mariana read the comments and let out a light laugh.

\-       "Guys, guys!" she said, raising her hands in a conciliatory gesture. "Okay, listen, I have to confess something."

The chat paused for a moment, as if everyone was holding their breath.

\-       "The truth is... everything that happened with the shadows was a prank I played on Camila." Mariana smiled with a knowing look, as if sharing a funny secret with her followers. "I wanted to do something different for Halloween and thought about playing with the idea of shadows. It was super easy to edit the videos afterward to make it look like something weird was happening."

u/sombraslocas: "What?! Really?"

u/superfanshadow: "Haha, poor Camila, she must've been so scared."

Mariana nodded, smiling even wider.

\-       "Yeah, she was so convinced something paranormal was happening. I felt a little guilty, but it was also really funny. It’s just that Camila is so easy to scare!"

The chat exploded with laughter and emojis, some followers applauding her creativity, others asking her not to make fun of her friend.

\-       "The important thing is that everything’s fine now," Mariana continued. "I already talked to Camila, and although she’s still a bit upset with me, I’m sure we’ll be doing streams together again soon."

The comments turned mostly positive, with followers praising the idea or asking for new challenges. But among the hundreds of messages, one caught Mariana's attention.

  
u/miradasombría: "If it was a prank, why is your shadow still not moving with you?"  
  


Mariana froze for a moment. She looked at the wall behind her, where the soft light cast a seemingly normal shadow. She blinked several times and then looked back at the camera, with a nervous laugh.

\-       "Okay, I think some of you are too immersed in the story. Relax!" she joked, but her tone sounded tenser than before.

The stream continued for a few more minutes with casual questions and jokes, but Mariana ended it earlier than usual, claiming she was tired.

  
Camila watched the stream in silence from her phone. Every word from Mariana felt like a knife. She knew it wasn’t a joke; Mariana was never that skilled with video editing, and her explanation had too many holes. But what troubled her the most was that moment when Mariana looked at her shadow. Camila noticed it. Although Mariana acted like everything was fine, there was something in her gaze, a spark of fear or confusion, as if even she couldn’t be completely sure of what was happening.

The change in Mariana continued to become more evident, but only to Camila. The small details, the inconsistencies in her habits, in her way of speaking or laughing, piled up like an unbearable weight. The worst part was that no one else seemed to notice, not even the followers, who often commented on how good Mariana looked and how entertaining her videos were. Camila couldn’t stand it any longer. She decided to confront her directly one night after Mariana finished a solo stream.

\-       "That’s not you, Mariana!" Camila shouted, her eyes on the verge of tears. "I’ve been watching you... you’re not the same anymore. Something changed after that game, and you know it."

Mariana looked at her calmly, too calmly. Her face had an almost amused expression, as if she enjoyed Camila’s suffering.

\-       "What are you saying? Of course, it’s me. Maybe the one who changed here is you."

\-       "Don’t say that!" Camila retorted, feeling panic taking over her. "I know you’re not Mariana. Tell me what you did to her!"

For the first time, Mariana dropped the mask. Her smile widened unnaturally, and her eyes, dark and empty, fixed on Camila.

\-       "Why do you keep fighting, Camila? Mariana is gone. It’s me now. I’ll always be me."

In the following days, Camila completely distanced herself from the streams. She couldn’t stand watching "Mariana" interact with her followers as if nothing had happened, as if the real Mariana had never existed. She tried to seek help, but no one believed her. Even her followers started attacking her, calling her jealous and selfish for trying to ruin Mariana's image. One night, out of sheer desperation, Camila checked the social media channel. There, she found a stream that "Mariana" had started alone. The screen showed Mariana sitting in her room, with the dim light they used to create shadows in their games.

\-       "Hey, guys. Today I don’t have Camila with me, but I wanted to spend some time with you. I’ve been thinking a lot lately... about who I am, about who I want to be."

The comments were filled with compliments and emojis, but Camila noticed something strange… Mariana had a different approach, one she usually didn’t do. The light came from another direction, the camera focused only on her face in close-up, as if everything had been meticulously arranged so… so that Mariana’s shadow wouldn’t be seen. Suddenly, the "Mariana" on screen leaned toward the camera, her expression changing to a disturbing smile.

\-       "Thank you all for helping me find myself. Now I know exactly who I am."

The stream ended abruptly. Camila felt a chill run down her spine. Mariana’s words echoed in her mind: "I know exactly who I am."
