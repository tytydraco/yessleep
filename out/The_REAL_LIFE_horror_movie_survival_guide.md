One afternoon while browsing a second-hand bookstore, Derek happened upon a novelty item which caught his eye. The ‘deluxe edition’ of ‘The REAL LIFE Horror Movie Survival Guide’ was presented as a serious work of non-fiction, but the silly ‘rule book’ style narrative strongly lent itself to tongue-in-cheek territory. The oddly-titled self-help encyclopedia was heavily smudged and dog-eared from previous misuse but that didn’t matter to him. It just gave the book character. It was exactly what he was looking for. A fun little read which would help pass the time until the approaching storm ended. 

Back at home, he poured himself a cool drink and settled into his favorite recliner. Thunder roared and clapped violently. He’d arrived back at home, just in the nick of time by the looks of things. The front and back cover were illustrated with cartoonish murderous scenarios, while the foreword extolled the virtues of absorbing every single word, lest a cliché death befall the reader. How else would a person fend off various forms of ‘evil incarnate’? 

It was hilarious to Derek how utterly serious the mood was maintained throughout for the parody advice offered on its pages. In spite of the gravely straight writing style, he had to grin from ear-to-ear. He removed the dust cover to spare it any further damage. A handwritten note was scribbled on the back of the paper but he didn’t pay it any mind. He assumed the hastily-penned missive was the previous owner’s mindless graffiti or addendum notes. ‘Haunting mystery, blood-curdling excitement, and white-knuckle adventure’ surely awaited.

The opening chapter title didn’t disappoint. It was a doozie. It warned: “Always assume you are living in a horror movie. Yes, you! The signs are there. You may deny it, but it’s true.”

The paranoid sounding idea was both ridiculous and over-the-top, but in the cooperative spirit of playing along, he threw himself into the role of ‘horror movie victim’. It would make the imaginary excursion more enjoyable. The wind howled as night fell on his rural estate. More than a few times, the power flickered off and then back on during the fierce tempest. The serendipitous coincidence of which, readily added to the ominous mood. When the power went completely out, Derek wasn’t even surprised. It would be quite a while before the electrical crew could repair it. Most likely they would wait until the torrential downpour ceased.

He stumbled through the darkness until he made it to the kitchen. There he located an old flashlight which had languished in the junk drawer for years. After smacking it violently a few times against his palm, the dim bulb flickered until the ray it cast was satisfactory. The batteries were ancient. He also had candles he could light… somewhere. In the living room, he picked up his home phone receiver to call about the outage. The sooner he notified the authorities, the quicker they would be dispatched. Oddly, it too was dead. It might have passed as foreshadowing of trouble, if he didn’t know better.

His cell phone remained in the car because the reception was nearly nonexistent in the remote countryside. It was going to be a long weekend. The emergency candles were supposed to be in the junk drawer too but he couldn’t initially find them. They had probably been pushed all the way to the back of the drawer until they fell over the top and tumbled underneath; way down to the unused storage area below. He figured they were buried in that pile, along with the lost treasures of the Inca. He was right. Many other lost things were sequestered in the overflow pile of miscellaneous debris.

With four candles and a lighter, Derek managed to create enough ambient light in the living room to continue his reading. The next chapter: ‘Never back into a darkened room’; seemed more like practical, common-sense advice for everyone. Nevertheless, with full-blown suspense the book cautioned the reader that, ‘Evil is always waiting in the darkness’. It explained that It’s best to enter dark rooms facing forward, so you have a slight chance of fending off the merciless axe or chainsaw attack. 

Derek smiled at the familiar themes and wondered if anyone actually took the book seriously. It was very clever. Unfortunately his amusement was interrupted by the discordant sound of breaking glass near the back of his house. The frequent thunderclaps drowned out most other noises from outside but this one was very clear. It caused a moment of doubt and genuine concern when he heard the invasive crash. “Probably a limb from the old oak tree has fallen against the house and smashed the window.”; He nervously theorized. 

Despite his running hypothesis, he didn’t immediately rise to verify it. “Whatever it is can wait until I’m good and ready.”; He justified with a shaky sense of false bravado. The candlelight illumination remained fairly consistent but the shadows at the edge of the room seemed to be shifting and moving. It had to be his imagination. The old homestead was definitely spooky with the power out but he was a man grounded in reason and scientific logic. 

The third chapter was aptly titled: “Trust your instincts.” It discussed the importance of listening to your inner voice and being self-aware. Naturally that depended on the reality of the situation. Derek THOUGHT he was ‘self-aware’ (of life in general) but he still struggled with clarity issues. Not the least of which was, he didn’t have the courage to investigate the serious mystery transpiring in his back room. He was much too afraid to investigate the cause of the unexplained noise and just tried to avoid it entirely. He hoped it would go away on its own. If anything, that was the opposite of ‘self aware’. It was denial in the truest sense. The book deeply discouraged that sort of illogical behavior. 

Next came the chapter: “Don’t call out ‘who’s there?’ in a darkened room.”

Again, the guide made perfectly good sense. He knew he was alone in the house. If he wasn’t anymore, the human intruder or malevolent entity lurking in the dark wasn’t about to truthfully answer, were they? It was an exercise in pointless futility but Derek’s fragmenting imagination automatically went for the least malicious possibility. That illusion offered the most soothing peace of mind. 

‘Maybe the shattered glass sound was only a lost child seeking shelter, or a raccoon frightened by the thunder?’; Or, ‘Maybe, just maybe it was a knife-wielding lunatic who’d escaped from a nearby asylum!’ Either option was equally possible. The ‘happy’ outcome was no more likely to be true than the other scenario but he desperately clung to the ‘safe’ one like a flimsy styrofoam life preserver bobbing on an angry sea. He’d spooked himself into a veritable froth of fear. The novelty volume Derek originally thought to be laughable and absurd, was rapidly becoming his only source of clarity.

While the raging storm had abated significantly, the unexplained noises around him were definitely increasing. The glass chandelier rattled and shook menacingly. It was as if an unknown soul was in the room above him stomping around, in the otherwise ‘empty’ house. Then an echo of heavy footsteps resonated in the air, as the staircase leading downstairs began to creak. Their burden unseen in the dark. “Who’s there!”; He demanded. His voice was shaky and uneven. He ignored the important rule he’d only recently read about not addressing the unwelcome presence. Fear will make you do that. 

Immediately, he regretted calling out. It only demonstrated where he was in the room to the intruder. The guide book was correct. No one responded to the pointless query, and now he was a sitting duck in the recliner. Lightning from afar temporarily illuminated the living room. Nothing visible descended the staircase, yet the planks continued to creak. The terrifying footfalls grew nearer. 

Whatever unseen thing invading his country estate was actually close enough to smell. A foul, acrid stench filled the air and the temperature dropped significantly. Derek imagined the vapor of his own breath lingering in the darkness like a rolling fog. Heavy, measured breathing beside the recliner first mirrored his own labored gasps, but then lost its synchronistic cadence as his terror level increased. As much as he wanted to be alone, he was not.

Shaken beyond words, the ‘man of science and reason’ leapt up and ran through the nearly impenetrable pitch for his front door. Derek collided with the oak threshold and nearly ran it through, cartoon-style. His scream would’ve been evident from three miles away as he fumbled with the knob. He finally accomplished the everyday task and flung it open in an absolute frenzy to escape. He left behind the guide book but it hardly mattered. He was far too rattled to follow its step-by-step instructions. 

“Make sure you have your car keys before fleeing the scene of an active haunting or massacre.” That’s the information the book would have covered next if Derek had kept his cool a little longer, as well as “Always look in the back seat before getting in the car.” Those are highly pertinent details that would’ve saved him a great deal of grief and despair. 

Unfortunately he was waist deep in the middle of a supernatural crisis and unsuccessfully dealing with the sobering facts. He absolutely WAS living in a horror movie and had just reached the predictable scene where the clueless main character realized his car keys were not in his pocket. Just when he needed them most. 

“Damn it to hell!”; He cursed while fumbling with his pants and coat pockets. He already knew the ugly truth. His keys were in the decorative bowl on the foyer table. That’s where he always tossed them when he got home. The thought of having to go back inside filled him with the deepest sense of dread but it had to be done. The storm was still in full force, and he was a half dozen miles from town. 

He bribed himself with the knowledge that they were JUST inside the front door. He could dart in and grab them ‘in a flash’. That optimistic plan sounded vaguely doable in theory but the actual practice of re-entering ‘spook central’ was infinitely harder to justify. He stalled and agonized for a while but time was on the side of the evil, unknown entity waiting for him within. Derek had to bite the proverbial bullet and get it done. 

At the threshold, all appeared quiet. There was surely something in the book about dangerous situations appearing harmless and safe from the outside. Derek’s muscles tensed as he tried to psyche himself up. Was something really waiting just inside, or was it merely a figment of his imagination? Getting drenched, he felt silly. It was his home for Heaven’s sake. Nothing even remotely supernatural had ever occurred there before. Why now? He was actually ashamed of being afraid of a storm and a handful of spooky noises. 

All he had to do was go in and wait for the power to return like a rational adult. There was no logical reason for him to cower outside like a small child terrified of a boogeyman hiding under his bed. The problem was, disembodied footsteps and rattling chandeliers can’t easily be explained. Rational or otherwise. Derek struggled with the strength of his convictions when he stepped into the darkness of the hall. 

Blindly, he searched by fanning his hands for the edge of the table and the fancy bowl. The first few swipes came up empty. Nothing but air. Then he made contact with the corner of the table. The bowl rattled from his heavy-handed search in the dark. As he zeroed in on the keys to his freedom, his naive optimism briefly returned. It seemed like things might just turn out ‘alright’. 

Then, an unholy ‘witch’ screeched at him from close proximity. The low hiss sent shivers down his spine and when her cold, very dead hand grabbed his in the black abyss of the foyer, he let out an inhuman shriek which surpassed the previous one. The difference this time, was that he possessed the wherewithal to also grab his keys from the bowl before tearing out of there like his soul depended on it. Perhaps the ‘REAL LIFE horror movie survival guide’ had left its mark on him after all. 

Derek committed the cardinal sin of not checking the back seat first, but as far as he was concerned, anything back there couldn’t be any worse than whatever he’d left behind in the house. After the requisite fumbling with the door lock, and then again with the ignition, he peeled out of his driveway as fast as he could go. The relentless downpour continued with no end in sight. His windshield wipers struggled to offer a clear view of the winding path forward. A couple miles down the road, the danger appeared to have abated and he started feeling more at-ease. 

Derek hardly noticed when a solitary figure in black partially blocked the roadway up ahead. Who would’ve expected such a unusual thing in the middle of a dark, stormy night? Well, he would have, if he’d just finished reading the instruction manual. The dual chapters: ‘Never pick up mysterious hitchhikers on the side of the road”; and “Never accept a car ride from a maniacal psycho” were crystal clear about the dangers of those two polar opposite (but equally dangerous) behaviors. He swerved at the last possible moment, and luckily managed to avoid the ‘careless pedestrian’ and the ditch.

Glancing in the rear view mirror after correcting the car, the robed phantom vanished from the roadway! Duh! The incident might’ve passed in his head as merely a weird coincidence, but the diabolical face of the same hitchhiker now stared at him from the back seat. The sadistic specter wasn’t done with him yet. Not by a long shot. As is often the case in these real life horror movie scenarios, the evil soul had attached itself directly to his skin, and stuck to it like glue. 

Derek didn’t stop until he reached town. It would be daylight in a few hours and he hoped he’d find some peace. As much as he tried to resist, he occasionally eyed the corpse laughing at him from the back seat. Reality hit him. There was no place to go. ‘She’ would follow him wherever he fled to. That being the case, he needed to find a way to exorcise the entity mercilessly taunting him. 

He hoped to locate another copy of the guide book. With any luck, it might have the answers he sought. In less than 24 hours it made a believer out of a previously hardcore skeptic. Fitfully he tried to sleep in the front seat until the store opened but it wasn’t easy. She kicked the rear of his seat and cackled every time he nodded off.

Unfortunately, the used bookstore didn’t have another copy, but it was a moot point. The curse was upon HIM, not his HOME, so he might as well just return home and finish the copy he already paid for. With the storm finally over and the warm rays of sunshine changing his somber mood to hope again, much of the past evening felt like a fanciful nightmare. A sunny day can absolutely improve one’s gloomy perspective but the grinning ghoul glaring at him in the mirror reminded him she was indeed, very real. 

At home, he noticed the power was restored. The upstairs bedroom window was shattered with the glass littering the floor of the room. His uninvited guest probably flew in on her broom to make a grand entrance. He swept up the loose shards and encased the broken window in plastic. His house might’ve been haunted by an ornery poltergeist from Hell, but that was no reason for his floor to get ruined from rain damage. All chores completed, Derek sat down to finish the book. 

“Mirrors are the sinister gateway to dark realms.”

He read the relatable title of that chapter and sneered. He’d already learned that little factoid the hard way. If only he’d gotten further into the guide before all hell broke loose, he might’ve been better prepared. The simple truth was, Derek had been in full-blown denial. Most people are when faced with distasteful facts.

Things were different now. With the incessant laughter in the background and sharp objects levitating nearby as a vivid reminder of her evil presence, pretense was over. He accepted that his life was fully immersed in a real-life, horror-film level extravaganza. Hopefully the manual had practical and effective methods to vanquish the supernatural chaos he’d fallen into. Unfortunately, the next few chapters focused more on homicidal lunatics of the still-breathing variety. 

“Never accept a drink from a stranger.”, “Never mock a psycho.”“Never trust a clown.”, “Resist the urge to make out with your girlfriend in an abandoned building / haunted house.”, “Never split up your group with a killer nearby.”, “Don’t put down your gun / knife / hatchet / chainsaw / hedge trimmers.”, “Don’t assume the killer is actually dead / Don’t stop hacking up the psychopath before he’s in tiny pieces; then burn the remains.” 

It seemed like the book had all the cliché bases and horror film tropes covered. Derek decided to skim through those unrelated chapters to be fully thorough. There was definitely practical wisdom which could be cataloged for the future, in case his next misadventure followed those predictable genre lines. If any of that happened, he’d be fully prepared. 

The thing was, there was a much more pressing, real-life concern waiting; or more specifically hovering directly above him and stinking up the place with her ‘odeur du rot’. In deference to solving his current crisis, he searched the table of contents. There he hoped to find the answers he desperately needed immediately, and was greatly relieved to spot the very chapter to assist him. 

“So, you’ve got a Demonic Beast / Cackling Witch Ghoul / or Undead Fiend terrorizing you, non stop? Turn to page 274 for a failsafe solution.”

Derek rapidly flipped to the end of the guide but was infuriated to realize the whole chapter was missing! Upon closer inspection he noticed it had been torn out. He couldn’t believe his eyes. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”; He shouted angrily. The answer to his ‘little haunting issue’ had been crudely removed and discarded by some sadistic prankster. 

He scrambled to pick up the dust cover in hopes the missing section’s pages had simply fallen away from the binding and were loosely enclosed there. To his furious dismay, they were not. As he turned over the dust jacket in bewilderment, he finally read the aforementioned inscription; which had been penned by his uninvited guest. Her restless spirit was bound to the accursed book. 

“The missing pages are always the most important ones.”
