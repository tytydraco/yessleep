This project was *supposed* to be my big break. A way to reel in some fresh subscribers. It seemed like the perfect way of capitalizing on Influencer Magazine naming me one of their ‘Top 10 emerging content creators to follow in 2023’. Think about it: a video series about a tough, marshy grassland transforming into a healthy, vibrant ecosystem.

The potential social engagement was limitless...

Six months ago, I broke ground beside the forest bordering my six-acre home. I mostly did the labour myself because all the local landscaping companies (very stupidly) refused to work for exposure.

I started by digging out the pond’s different levels, which would help keep the temperature stable throughout the year. Then, once the hole got filled, I smoothed out the edges and built an observation blind for capturing dynamic action shots. I also added perches and nest boxes to attract the bird-watching community. All the while, my dedicated fans received project ‘tasters’ via TikTok and Snapchat.

I spread two dozen species of wildflowers throughout the area. By late Autumn diving beetles, backswimmers, and pond skimmers had arrived, and Eastern phoebes started using the perches to pick them off. A skinny, grey kitten also started showing up, meowing away while I tiled and raked the pond. People *love* seeing animals get rehomed, so my wife, Alex, posted Insta stories about how we earned the feral critter's trust, gradually moving plates of tuna closer to the house. Soon, ‘Jinx’ moved in with us, and Alex officially entered her animal lover era, thereby dispelling the ridiculous myth she was ‘selfish’ and ‘out of touch’ just because she made that food stamp challenge video.

Bugs soon came to feed on the flowers which, inevitably, attracted one of nature’s fiercest predators: jumping spiders. Christmas came early when frogs and toads took up residence.

Talk about engaging content—these vids had the potential to rack up hundreds of thousands of views, easy.

The first stumbling block came in January, when Alex woke up and discovered the sunflowers had been trampled. Now she couldn’t snap selfies of herself lying amongst them. I went to go investigate.

Over winter the amphibians got used to me wandering around, but now they jumped straight into the deep end of the pond whenever I approached. Either the paparazzi came snooping around trying to capture photos of Alex and I, or a snake had paid the flourishing habitat a visit. Well, with predation being part of the circle of life (and, more importantly, exciting content) I hoped for the latter.

Unfortunately, over the coming weeks, the damage escalated beyond flattened plants. Each morning, there’d be diced carcasses floating in the water: squirrels, finches, racoons. This upset me because graphic content scares off sponsors.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered that, according to Google, no creature native to this part of the world tore apart such large animals so ferociously *and* created a Jackson Pollock painting with the insides.

I’d stumbled across YouTube gold; my mind buzzed with clickbait titles. Now, I could pivot into a ‘murder mystery’ series, and after determining what the creature was, set up a humane trap, capture the culprit, and release it to an animal sanctuary. Hell, I could even toss in a donation link.

Channelling my inner David Attenborough, I recorded several Vlogs about the hunt, before finally setting up a trail cam in the observation blind. All I needed to do was let it record overnight. Simple.

The next morning, blue-purple guts lay spread across the garden and walkway. There were even blood speckles across the bay window at the back of the lounge. I reviewed the recorded footage in fast-forward, but all it captured were terrified sparrows abandoning their nest box.

I was furious. No creature wandered into *my* pond and exterminated its inhabitants. Not without generating usable content. I developed this project on my own—even quit a full-time job to support it. No help from family, no backup plan. Just a $250,000 loan from my parents.

This mystery beast had too much space to play around in, so I shaved away grass right up to the forest's edge and positioned ten cameras throughout the garden, each streaming directly to my computer. Now, if a termite so much as poked its head above ground, I’d capture the sucker in glorious HD.

That night, I sat at my computer desk editing vids with Jinx sprawled across my lap. The second monitor cycled through surveillance cams.

Sometime after midnight, just as my eyelids started drooping shut, birds took flight out in the forest. The fluttering wings startled me alert so suddenly Jinx jumped away.

I cycled through security footage, only catching glimpses of branches dipping, or shadows close to the ground. Within seconds the creature slipped past cams 1, 2, *and* 3.

As bulrushes bowed out of frame on cam 6, I grabbed my phone to record a live reaction. “This is it, guys. We’re about to catch our first glimpse of this sucker.”

At the pond, toads and frogs went wild ribbiting away, but from the observation bind I could only make out ripples travelling across the surface of the water. My pulse raced as I flicked between feeds.

Empty, every one of them empty. I needed a juicy money shot the YouTube community could chew on. Otherwise, this whole project was a complete waste of time.

From the lounge, I heard glass shake in its housing. With the phone still recording, I tiptoed past the hall and pushed open the lounge door.

Up ahead, light only splashed across part of the room, but at the far side, a glowing pair of eyes darted from left to right beyond the blinds covering the bay window. I froze.

As I switched to the forward-facing camera, glass exploded inward, and then a frail figure, silhouetted against the moonlight, crawled through the gap on all fours. For a moment, it resembled a pale girl draped in a long, torn sheet. She looked thinner than Jinx when we found him, and hideously pale except for her jet-black hair, which draped over her skull and hid her features.

Did a deranged clout chaser want to appear in my videos? Or was this a homeless child raised in seclusion? Either option was a winner so far as the YouTube algorithm was concerned—there’d be mainstream articles about this, maybe even an interview on The View.

Terrified but also excited, I said, “Hello?”

The girl’s head whipped in my direction. As it did, she straightened out her limbs, growing taller and taller, supported by four limbs longer than stilts and thinner than rods.

This was no girl. Hell, it wasn’t even human.

As a glowing pair of eyes settled on me, I turned and bolted across the hall, into the bathroom, and locked the door. Beyond it, sharp nails dragged roughly across wooden floorboards.

Ceramic lamps crashed onto the ground and framed photographs got knocked off walls as thuds and bumps moved throughout the house. 

At one-point, heavy footsteps travelled above my head. I would have left my safe spot, but, judging by the silence, Alex already found a hiding spot. If I went out, it might have exposed us both. So I made the heroic decision to stay put.

My heart slammed against my chest so fast and so loud I didn't notice the house fall into a dead silence. With my heart in my throat, I slowly creaked open the door.

The walls and ceiling were covered with deep gouges like an axe wielding-maniac had gone back and forth. My hands would not stop shaking as I reviewed the footage my phone recorded—this had the potential to go mega viral. Think of it, a real-life Cryptid.

Unfortunately, to my horror, the second the entity crawled inside the house, the footage began distorting. Through the pixelation, you couldn’t make out a single thing.

Upstairs Alex hid in her walk-in closet, amongst the clothes from her latest 'try on haul' vid. Also, Jinx had disappeared.

That brings us to right now. I’ve purchased a $43,000 camera that reviewers say never blurs or pixelates. I’ve also bought specialist hunting gear, such as bear traps and remote-controlled cages. The plan is to catch this otherworldly entity on film and silence the haters.

I wanted to post because a lot of you have been asking for updates. Just know there’s content on the way, and for those of you interested in the NFT space, we’ve got an extra-special announcement coming soon.
