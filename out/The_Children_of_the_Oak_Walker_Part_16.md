[\[Part 15\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1atdi17/the_children_of_the_oak_walker_part_15/)

I sat at my writing desk and stared at the blank sheet of paper in front of me.  
As part of my agreement with Mr. Koranti, I had to write a letter to the authorities at New Wilderness encouraging them to surrender, in exchange for safe passage out of the ‘red zone’ as the interior of Barron County was known. I’d been upgraded from my cubicle to a separate room on the fifth floor, a well-furnished place with big windows and furniture done all in modern pastels of white, gray, and beige. However, the windows were bulletproof, thick enough that I had no chance of breaking through them, and I knew for a fact that the ELSAR staff were watching me 24/7. I spotted tiny holes drilled in the otherwise brand-new walls in oddball places, found little microphones in a vase of fake flowers, and discovered a plastic chip on the back of my neck after my first shower, likely some sort of tracking device. Every day a ‘maid’ came through to clean, though I could tell from how she worked that it was more of a controlled search. Some requests I made were filled with great flair; I received all sorts of writing things, pens, pencils, paper, and even paint. But anything that I could have used to hurt myself or someone else was tightly controlled; my pencils couldn’t get too sharp or they’d take them, my shaving razor was given to me only during shower time, which was the same time every day at 0600, and was confiscated right after. They had cameras watching the bathroom too, but I didn’t care anymore. After all, I’d already promised my life away. What did it matter who saw me naked?  
I turned my head to look out my window and sighed at the mid-day view of Black Oak.  
*Just to get out, smell the trees, walk on real dirt . . . will I ever do that again?*  
Looking back at my barren letter, I chewed my lower lip, and tried to think of what to say. ELSAR high command would read it before they sent it out, and I didn’t want to give them any more of an advantage than necessary, but I had to write something. While I grappled with some bland diplomatic slop to write down for Sean, my mind conjured up a barrage of things my fingers itched to scratch down.  
*Dear Chris. I know you kissed Jamie, Peter and I both saw you. I thought you liked me. Guess I should have dated the pirate, even if he smells like beer, he’s more honest than you.*  
I shut my eyes, and tried to breathe slow, but the thoughts kept coming, like an avalanche of pent-up fury.  
*Dear Jamie. You lying, two-faced whore. You kissed him You KISSED him, even though you knew he was mine! I hope you get eaten by a Birch Crawler just like your loser brother . . .*  
“Stop it.” Gritting my teeth, I hissed angrily at myself, and shook my head. “That’s too far. You need to calm down.”  
I pushed off from the desk and walked to a compact acoustic booth in the corner of my room. Since they never let me go out (they said it was to keep me as healthy as possible, but I knew it was to keep me from trying to escape) ELSAR had given me a special treadmill in my room, so my muscles stayed in good condition. The device came equipped with a virtual reality headset, and variable-terrain rollers under the main belt to simulate sticks, rocks, and bumps in the earth. Each had some kind of porous cloth over it, allowing for the simulation of trees, bushes, and even buildings by touch, the material hardening or shaping via electrical current. Nothing compared to the serene beauty of a real forest, it was at least enough to keep my stress levels at bay, and so I stepped inside.  
With the door shut, I slid the bulky plastic headset on and tightened the Velcro straps around my head. “Forest walk, one mile.”  
A loading screen appeared before my eyes, with a flying bird logo and the words ‘*Black Wing Software Inc.’* I had a feeling it was one of the many ‘faces’ Mr. Koranti reported his organization wore, a mid-tier technology company that developed games, computer programs, and other harmless things to keep the public eye off target. Now that I thought about it, I’d seen a few obscure games offered by this company before, to include an upcoming fantasy one that had looked promising.  
Of course, the appeal wore off now that I had everything at my fingertips but freedom.  
My dim surroundings lit up, and a bright green forest came into focus, with sunlight filtering through the oak leaves overhead, and birds chirping in the branches. A cool breeze caressed my face, and even though I knew that it was generated by small electric fans within the booth, it was still a nice touch. Of course, it didn’t smell like the real thing; even this level of technology could only accomplish so much. Soft, crumbly earth squished under my sock feet, but since it wasn’t real, I walked on through the mud without a care.  
I had no particular direction that I intended to go. The forest map in this program lay the same each time, though it dropped you in different locations at every new start. Always I had the same routine; walk for a little while, find a ‘log’ and sit down. At that point, I usually cried, screamed, or swore at the top of my lungs, raging at everyone and anyone. ELSAR monitored the virtual reality servers, so I knew they were listening in, but so what? If they didn’t like it, they could just take my treadmill away.  
Trudging through the woods, I did my best not to think about Chris or Jamie, but my heart panged deep in my chest at how close it all looked to the woods around New Wilderness.  
I spotted a nice smooth chunk of granite, and settled myself down, leaning back against it so the yellow dapples of sunlight trickled my upturned face. Part of me wanted to launch into another shouting-fit, but I didn’t have the mental strength. Being angry made my head throb, and I always felt worse afterwards.  
“I love you.” Lying on my back I whispered the words just loud enough so I could hear them above the rustling of leaves in the treetops, the shushing of the wind, and the songs of birds. Even if it was coming from me, just imagining the words in Chris’s voice was too intoxicating to pass up. We’d never said such things to each other yet, but I wanted to hear it now more than ever. I’d thought about trying to sneak it into my note, to tell him how I felt in some clever hidden code, but I knew ELSAR would use it as fuel against him if they found out.  
Besides, I wasn’t sure if I should feel that way now, all things considered.  
“Hannah?”  
I jolted upright and gasped out a frightened yelp.  
No one stood to my left, save for a little red cardinal perched on a stump.  
“Hannah Brun?”  
My eyes widened, and I stared at the bird.  
*Am I going crazy? Is this thing broken? Maybe I should take the headset off.*  
The bird ruffled its feathers in the way any other might have and cocked its scarlet head to look at me through one dark eye. “Look, we don’t have much time. I know you can hear me. Are you Hannah Brun, yes or no?”  
A woman’s voice, one I didn’t recognize, flowed out of the bird’s beak like some kind of speaker, and I folded my arms over my chest with a nervous shrug. “Yeah. That’s me. Who are you?”  
Everything went black, and soft dirt hardened into the standard floor of the VR booth beneath my feet.  
I reached to unstrap the headset, and heard the door slam open, as rough hands grabbed me from behind.   
They dragged me into the room, and the headset fell away to reveal several gray uniforms of guards, but with a green shield on their shoulders marked *‘Auxiliary Corps’.*  
“Tear the place apart.” A girl walked in through the open door of my room, her dark hair tied back in a practical military bun, both chestnut-brown eyes focused on me with a cold glint. “Fredricks, tap into her mainframe and get a fix on that third-party IP address. I want to know where it came from before tech support gets their greasy fingers on things. Benson, bring me every scrap of paper you can find.”  
Confused, I blinked at the two guards who had my arms pinned, the others rifling through my room like they were on a hunt for something important. Curtains were ripped down, pillows sliced open, the rug torn up. My dresser had every drawer thrown to the ground, all my clothes pawed through. They all had closed-cropped hair, the boys shaved almost bald, the few girls with short ponytails or buns. Most looked no older than myself, but wore hard, dangerous glares or sneers, pistols on their belts, and gleaming new submachine guns on their shoulders. One female guard shoved her hands through my pockets and along my body with uncaring roughness, and the first girl who had spoken laced her hands behind her back in stern impatience.  
“Who were you talking to?” She wore two black bars on the collar of her uniform, which I guessed to be the marks of an officer, and from the way the others waited on her command, that had to be the case. But something else about her sparked an image in my head, a flicker of memory, and my guts sank.  
I knew her.  
I’d shot one of her squad members in the southlands . . . and she’d been there to see it.  
*She isn’t going to kill me, is she? No way they’d let her do that. I agreed to their terms, I’ve done everything they asked, they’re supposed to protect me.*  
Swallowing a lump of fear, I remembered how she’d come mere feet from stabbing me at the coal barge and shook my head. “I-I don’t know. I wasn’t talking to anyone. I mean, I was just using the woods simulator, and this bird came out of nowhere . . .”  
As if in annoyed by my stumbling words, the officer rolled her eyes and twirled one pointer finger in the air through some kind of pre-determined signal. “Alright, time for a picnic. We’re moving to a code white. I want all entrance guards doubled, and both QRF teams on stand-by until I say so.”  
On her word, the others shoveled my scattered clothes into a small backpack and stuffed my hygiene kit in as well. Metal cuffs clicked onto my wrists, and one of the guards pushed my head down so that I had to walk hunched over, the group marching me out into the hall like some sort of escaped convict. I had no idea what I’d done, who I’d spoken with, and why I was being punished for using a device that ELSAR had given me, but all I could think of in that moment was the memory of the soldier I’d gunned down back in the southlands. In my head, I could see his bearded face as he died, and recalled how he’d used the last of his strength to save my life from the girl who led me away now. I hadn’t even known his name, but I could never forget his face. It had been my first human kill, and despite it being a justified self-defense shooting, it still weighed with a heavy guilt in my chest.  
Just before we reached a set of black elevator doors, a skinny figure came sprinting up the hall from behind us, and two of the guards raised their weapons in reflex.  
“Excuse me. *Excuse me!* What do you think you’re doing?” He wore a white lab coat over gray work slacks and a button-down pressed shirt, the light colors a sharp contrast from his swarthy complexion. Judging by his facial features, I figured him to be college age, maybe in his later twenties. At first glance, I guessed him to be from somewhere in the Middle East or India, but the man didn’t speak with an accent. His eyes were familiar though; the same sandalwood brown as the ones that had looked down on me at the gurney, filled with sympathy.  
Daring to feel hopeful, I stayed quiet, and waited to see the guards’ reaction.  
*Maybe he can talk some sense into them.*  
Ignoring the raised submachine gun muzzles, the orderly jabbed a finger at me, his expression screwed into an irate frown directed at the female officer. “That is *my* specimen. You have no right to just move her without laboratory approval. This is a serious breach of protocol, you can’t just—”  
“Don’t spit that corporate line at me, Kaba.” The officer in charge rounded on him, both hands on her hips, where a long combat knife hung beside her service pistol. “Security is *my* job, and if you care about protocol so much, you can get on the phone to tech support and tell them they have thirty minutes to do an ID sweep of our servers, or I’ll personally shoot whoever’s in charge down there.”  
To my surprise, the man known as Kaba stepped toe-to-toe with her and glared right back in her haughty face. “She’s irreplaceable. If anyone so much as pulls a hair out of place, Koranti will be furious. I don’t care about IT, I don’t care what your job is, she is off-limits.”  
“Our security is compromised, so I’m moving her to a more defensible location.” Her smug expression frosted into a glower that could have been made of ice, and something about the way the officer bristled made me wonder how often she caused such issues. “If you need her, you can come get her. Otherwise, go back to your test tubes, and stay out of my way.”  
His jaw worked, as if Kaba wanted to shout another protest, but he seemed to realize he was outweighed, and shook his head in disgust. “Don’t hurt her, Crow. I’m serious. They won’t overlook this one.”  
*Crow? What kind of a name is that? Is that some kind of code?*  
I watched the orderly with pleading eyes, and prayed to whoever was listening that he could get me out of this mess.  
“I’ll put her in solitary.” With an indifferent snort, Crow turned her nose up and strode onward to the elevator. “A few cold nights won’t ruin her.”  
To my disappointment, Kaba didn’t move as they dragged me along, his Adam’s apple working in resentful swallows on his dark neck.  
*Ding.*  
The doors slid open at Crow’s thumb pressed to the digital access screen, and we all shuffled inside. Unlike the crystalline mirror-finish of the elevator Mr. Koranti had taken me on, this was made from cold, bland steel, like a freight elevator. A single yellow lightbulb illuminated the interior from overhead, and welded grating covered the open sides, long greasy cables visible in the shaft beyond. I tasted lubricating oil from the gears on the wind and shivered at the chilly interior.  
Crow pressed a few buttons on the control panel, and the elevator lurched downward in a whining of electric motors.  
“You’ll speak when spoken to.” She didn’t even look at me, thumbs hooked into her belt in a way that was painfully reminiscent of Jamie, and Crow picked at her thumbnail with a bored expression. “I don’t care how special they said you are; down here, you’re just another meat-suit, so don’t ask for anything unless its life-or-death. No talking, singing, or making noise like tapping on the walls. Don’t touch the guards; if they come for a search, you comply, no matter what. If I catch you with a weapon, any kind of weapon, I’ll make you wish your mother had an abortion. Understood?”  
Gulping, I nodded, unsure if I had the right to say so much as ‘yes’ at this point. Clearly, this girl would have preferred to throw me off the elevator, but it seemed the thin line of protocol she scoffed at prevented her from doing anything more than barking orders my way. Perhaps if I did as she said, waited things out, then cooler heads would prevail, and Koranti would send word for my release. I certainly couldn’t fight the guards, and doubted my newest captor would tolerate any resistance from me.  
*Ding.*  
Both metal elevator doors glided back, the digital number over the door reading -3, and a smell hit me like a pungent brick wall.  
Coppery and strong, it lingered in the air along with the scent of hot metal, enough to curdle my stomach. The walls were made of poured concrete, unpainted and gray, the floor just as plain with a few drains here and there. Simple industrial bar lights hung in intervals over the walkway, and several doors lined each side of the hall as it twisted out of sight. However, none of these morose settings could compare to the echoes of rapid-fire screams somewhere down the corridor.  
“Sounds like Olmer is having fun with that Molotov-thrower.” One of the male guards grunted, and his companions snickered.  
“That’ll teach him not to start trouble.” Another of the boys grinned, and his eyes twinkled with a malicious delight. “I hope the girl they caught him with is in there. Mouthy witch needs to learn her place.”  
“She already did.” To my left, one of the female guards smirked in a knowing way as I was shoved out into the hall ahead of them. “I had her for interrogation this morning. Came in all spit and fire, but left all tears and blood. She’ll never run from us again, that’s for sure.”  
My blood ran cold at the agonized wails, the unknown victim screeching in time with muffled blows that I could hear from where I stood. Only a few times in my life had I caught the sounds of someone in absolute crippling pain, and these groans were hoarse, as if the man had been undergoing his torment for a while now. Judging by the heavy aroma of blood on the air, the casual jests of the guards about their brutality, and the odd stains in various spots on the cement floor, I realized my situation had gone from bad, to worse.  
*Just stay calm. You’re valuable. They can’t hurt you, or Koranti will kill them.*  
Grateful now that they kept my head bent down, I focused on the concrete in front of my slip-on shoes, and pretended not to hear the screams multiply as we walked past various ill-lit cells.  
“All guards, drop what you’re doing, and double up on the entrances.” Crow snapped out commands without a blink at the horrendous conditions around her, black boot heels clicking on the floor in steady rhythm. “Benson, go tell Olmer to lay off with Detainee Nine. We need him and his squad on the front gate. Someone put a muzzle on Twenty-One, she’s giving me a migraine with all that squawking. Let’s move people, sometime today!”  
As the guards dispersed, the two holding my arms stopped in front of a small square door at the end of the hall, with white painted letters on the cement above marked ‘Solitary’. A cage-style door welded from angle iron stood in the space, and this was unlocked for me to be tossed through.  
No more than five feet square, the tiny room sported a short steel bunk on the wall, and a single brownish-gray blanket tossed over the bare metal. A toilet sat in one corner, devoid of even a curtain for privacy, and a spigot in the wall poised over a floor drain, which I figured was to serve as my sink, shower, and drinking water supply. It had no windows, only one light in the ceiling covered in wire mesh, and there were rusty-red spatter marks on the wall around the bed.  
“Take your time and get comfy.” A guard to my right breathed in my ear, his hand lingering on my neck a few seconds longer than necessary as his comrade pulled my cuffs off. “We’ll come back later for a bunk check. After all, you might have something hidden . . . and I’m good at searching.”  
He bounced his bushy eyebrows in a cruel suggestiveness and slapped the back of my scrub pants on his way out the door.   
My blood pressure soared, my rage turning red-hot, and I balled both fists at my side.  
*You touch me again and I’ll . . . I’ll . . .*   
Reality settled back in as the lock shut in my door, a sickening, dull clack that made me want to throw up.  
*I’ll do what? They own me now. If they don’t leave any marks, if there’s no evidence for the lab techs to find, who will believe it?*  
Tightness closed in on my chest, and I sat down on the narrow bunk, the blanket so thin that it may as well have not been there. How had it come to this? My old life in Kentucky seemed a fairytale compared to my current surroundings. I’d been safe there, loved by at least my parents, with a warm home and my own soft bed. No one would have ever put their hands on me, or my father would have slaughtered them. Even Carla wouldn’t have stood for it. Now I waited for Mr. Koranti of all people to come to my aid, a man who only cared about me for what I could bring him in value, as if I were a trinket in a museum.  
*Chris would have fought them all before he let someone touch me.*  
Tears welled in my eyes, and I buried my face in both hands. I would never see New Wilderness again. I’d never have another chance at a fancy dinner with Chris. I would never get to see my old room, sleep in my bed, walk the path in the cherry grove outside the lodge. Even if by some fairy-magic I got loose, there was nothing left for me there.  
Nothing but loneliness.  
Curling up on the bunk, I wrapped the papery blanket around my head, and tried to shut out the horrible noises from beyond my cell door as sorrow washed over me like a tidal wave.
