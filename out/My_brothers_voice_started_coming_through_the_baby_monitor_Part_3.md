We didn’t pack. Just grabbed Ellie, the diaper bag, and the keys. No checkout. No plan. Just distance. Just instinct.

I drove like the roads would disappear if I slowed down. Back roads, service routes, even dirt paths—anywhere but the places it had already touched. My wife, Sam, sat silent in the passenger seat, Ellie asleep in her arms, her tiny hand curled tight around that fraying blanket.

I didn’t know where we were going.

Didn’t matter.

Until the radio turned on by itself.

I hadn’t touched it. The display stayed dark. Just static, low and sharp like something breathing through the speakers.

Then a voice slipped through.

“Jake.”

It wasn’t a question. It was a warning.

“Caleb?” I said before I could stop myself. The air in the car changed—thinner, like the space around us was stretching. Sam straightened, her grip on Ellie tightening. Even asleep, Ellie stirred and made a soft sound—half-whimper, half-word. Like she recognized the voice.

It crackled through the static again, clearer this time.

“..go back..farmhouse..barrier’s thin there… can’t… he listens…”

The message broke apart like ice underfoot. The voice vanished.

I pulled over. Just stopped the car in the middle of nowhere. Sam looked at me, calm but firm.

“It followed us,” she said. “Even here. We can’t outrun it. But maybe Caleb can help us.”

“I don’t want to go back.”

“I know,” she said. “But I don’t think we have a choice.”

So we went back.

We pulled into the gravel driveway just as the sun started rising. The house smirked at our return. Like it expected us.

There was something on the doorstep.

A small wooden horse.

Ellie reached for it immediately, whimpering when I didn’t give it to her.

I knew that toy.

We hadn’t brought it with us. I knew we hadn’t. I’d cleaned it up weeks ago after finding it in a dusty attic box. It quickly became Ellie’s favorite. But it was not on the doorstep when we fled. I would’ve seen it.

Sam’s eyes locked on it. “That wasn’t there before.”

She wasn’t asking. 

We left Ellie asleep in the car, doors locked. I don’t care how weird that sounds—it felt safer than bringing her inside.

“I want to go up there,” Sam said, staring at the ceiling like she could see through it.

“The attic?” I asked.

She nodded slowly. “Right before we bought this place... I had a dream. It didn't make sense until just now. It felt like nothing back then—just a weird, disjointed image I shrugged off.”

“What was it?”

“I was in an attic. There was this… pressure in the air. Like being watched, but not by anything human. I didn’t think it mattered. Just stress, maybe. But the feeling I had in that dream—this creeping unease—it’s exactly what I feel right now.”

I felt the chill crawl up my spine. “You think it was a premonition?”

She turned to me. “I guess you're not the only one this place speaks to."

The attic smelled like old wood and colder air. Dust rose with every step. I could hear my own breath.

We didn’t find anything at first. Just the boxes we hadn’t touched, insulation flaking from the corners. Then I stepped on something soft.

A hollow creak.

Loose floorboard.

Underneath, wrapped in faded newspaper, was a stack of black-and-white photos. Old. Curled at the edges.

They looked like scenes from some secret ritual. Men and women in carved wooden masks stood in a circle, surrounding a baby laid out on something like an altar. Candles burned around them. Symbols scrawled in chalk or ash on the floor. The masks were too detailed, too lifelike.

The beams in the ceiling above them matched ours. So did the knot in the floorboards beneath the circle. This wasn’t just a ritual.

It had happened here. In our attic.

Sam found writing on the back. Names. Dates.

My family’s names.

People from my grandfather’s generation. Aunts, uncles, cousins. One photo had my grandfather in it, unmistakably younger but wearing the same smug smile I’d seen in old family albums.

He stood in OUR front yard, holding a baby.

Behind him, plain as day, was a crooked old mailbox.

Our last name on it.

“This was his house,” I said, barely breathing.

“I think it still is,” Sam whispered.

Suddenly, downstairs, something clicked on.

A radio.

The old tabletop radio in the dining room was lit up, crackling with static. The same one I’d thought was broken.

Then Caleb’s voice again.

“Ellie’s in danger. He’s still here.”

I leaned in. “Who? Who is he?”

“Our grandfather. He’s been waiting… watching. He needs her. A vessel. A second chance.”

Sam grabbed my arm. “Why didn’t your dad ever tell you any of this?”

A pause.

Then Caleb’s voice, raw and low: “I tried to warn him before you bought the house. He told me this was my fault. Said it was supposed to be me. Dad brought the horse. That's why he was here. He's in on it. I thought he might be happy to see me, or at least scared his dead kid was haunting him, but he was so matter of fact it was as if he expected me to be here.”

Calebs pain was palaple. Death didn't numb the wounds our Dad inflicted. 

Silence.

“Caleb—what do we do? How do we stop it?”

The static hissed louder, drowning him out. But just before it cut completely, I heard one more voice layered beneath the noise. Different. Smaller.

“Tell Carl…” it whispered. “Frank always wanted a brother, too.”

The room shook. Not an earthquake—something deeper. Like the whole house was breathing in.

We ran.

Grabbed Ellie. Drove straight to my father’s house.

The lights were on. But no one answered. I knocked. I called. Nothing.

A shadow passed behind the curtains.

I grabbed a rock.

Sam said nothing. Just held Ellie and ducked behind the car, ready.

I raised it high—

Just as my eyes squinted to shield them from the shards that would follow, the door opened.

And there was my dad.

Smiling.

Like nothing was wrong.

“Well, hey! What a surprise,” he said.
