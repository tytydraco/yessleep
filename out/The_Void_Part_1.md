**Log Entry 1**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.01**

**Commander Elias**

We’ve entered the void—an uncharted stretch of space spanning roughly two light-years across, according to initial scans. It’s unlike anything we’ve encountered before. No stars. No debris. No radiation. Just a perfect, cold vacuum.

Rena believes it’s some kind of cosmic dead zone, where matter and energy have been stripped away entirely. She called it fascinating. Kale called it terrifying. For me weirdly enough, it's familiar.

The ship feels... different here. Quiet. Too quiet. We’ve been in deep space for years, but this silence is different—it feels heavier, like it’s weighing on us.

We’ve begun running a full survey. I’ll admit, the crew is uneasy. Myself included.

**-The Observation Bay-**

Elias stood in the observation bay, hands clasped behind his back, staring into the darkness of the void. It wasn’t the kind of darkness one might see in a shadowed room or a moonless night—it was something deeper, an absence of light so complete it felt like the void could swallow him whole. The viewport lights reflected faintly off his face, casting his sharp features in a pale blue. Behind him, the soft hum of the ship’s life-support systems filled the air, steady as a heartbeat. Yet even that sound felt muted here, as though the emptiness of the void had wrapped around the ship and was muffling everything within.

“What do you think it is?” Rena’s voice cut through the silence, soft but probing.

He didn’t turn. She was leaning in the doorway, tablet tucked under one arm. Her sharp brown eyes watched him carefully, gauging his reaction.

“I think it’s just empty space,” Elias replied after a long pause, though his tone lacked conviction.

“Space isn’t supposed to be empty,” Rena said, stepping closer. She stopped a few feet from the viewport, her gaze shifting to match his. “There’s always something. Radiation. Subatomic particles. Gravitational waves. But here... nothing. It’s like it doesn’t want to exist.”

Elias finally turned to look at her. She wasn’t smiling. Rena had always been the optimist among them, the one to find beauty even in the harshest corners of space. But now, there was a sharp edge to her tone, a seriousness that unsettled him. He shifted his attention back to the viewport, narrowing his eyes. If he focused just right, he could see it—a faint distortion, barely more than a ripple in the black expanse. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, like the surface of a pond disturbed by a single drop of water.

“Do you see it?” he asked, his voice hushed, as though speaking too loudly might provoke whatever lurked beyond.

“I do,” she admitted. Her breath fogged the glass as she leaned closer. “It’s... moving almost distorting isn’t it?”

Elias nodded. It was slow, deliberate, like the void was alive and growing ever aware of their presence.

“Should we alert Kale?” Rena asked, her voice portraying the slightest tremor.

“Not yet.” Elias tore his eyes away and glanced at her. “Let’s gather more data first. No need to jump to conclusions.”

Rena nodded, but her expression remained tense. She lingered a moment longer, then turned and left without another word.

Elias stayed behind, accompanied by the hum of the ship.

For a long time, he simply stood there, staring out the viewport. It didn’t make sense. Nothing about this place made much sense. And yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they had crossed into something they were never meant to uncover.

**Log Entry 2**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.02**

**Lieutenant Rena**

I’ve never seen anything like this.

The anomaly near the center of the void defies every principle we know. It’s not a black hole—it doesn’t emit any Hawking radiation. It’s not a neutron star remnant—there’s no gravitational lensing strong enough to indicate mass. There’s no measurable energy signature. No mass, no heat, no sound.

Just a ripple in space, bending or distorting light and time in ways I can’t explain.

I’ve run every calculation, reviewed every model. The numbers tell me it shouldn’t exist, yet here it is. Expanding. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, but enough that Elias ordered an adjustment to our course.

Kale thinks I’m overthinking it. He’s joking to keep things light, but I see it too—when he thinks no one’s looking, his hands shake. He’s been spending more time in the engine room, tinkering with systems that don’t need repairs. It’s his way of coping.

Elias wants to push deeper into the anomaly, to study it closer. I can see the conflict on his face when he talks about it. He wants answers, but he’s cautious, too. He knows as well as I do that the deeper we go, the more this place feels...wrong.

None of us want to admit it yet, but we all feel it. That unsettling weight in the air. The sense that something is watching.

**-The Engine Room-**

Kale crouched beneath the main reactor, the tools in his hands moving with practiced precision as he tightened the bolts on a coolant valve. He didn’t need to be here. The ship’s diagnostics had shown the engines were running smoothly, as they always did. But sitting still wasn’t an option—not here, not with the uneasy feeling he has.

He grunted, giving the valve a final twist before tossing the wrench into his toolkit. “There you go, old girl,” he muttered to the Helios, patting the cold metal of the reactor housing. “Keep humming for me, yeah? Don’t let this place get to you.”

The words felt hollow as they left his mouth. The void was too quiet, even inside the ship. The usual vibration of the engines, the subtle hum of the reactor—everything seemed muted here, as if the emptiness outside was seeping in.

Kale straightened, wiping his hands on his jumpsuit, and froze. A faint clicking noise echoed through the room, sharp and irregular. It wasn’t loud, but it cut through the silence like a knife. He turned, his eyes scanning the rows of consoles and coolant lines. Nothing moved. The sound stopped.

“Pipes,” he muttered to himself. “Just the pipes settling. Always happens when we change course.”

He forced a chuckle, but it didn’t sound right even to his own ears. He waited, half-expecting the noise to start again. Nothing.

Shaking his head, he picked up his toolkit and started toward the exit. As he reached the doorway, the sound returned—faint, but unmistakable. A clicking, followed by a low, almost imperceptible hum. Kale stopped in his tracks, every muscle in his body tensing. The sound wasn’t random this time. It had a rhythm, a pattern, like the ticking of a clock. He turned slowly, his eyes scanning the room. “Hello?” he called out, his voice echoing faintly against the reactor walls.

Silence.

The ship felt colder now, the air heavier. He could feel his pulse pounding in his temples as he stepped back into the engine room, his eyes darting from shadowed corners to the faint glow of control panels.

“Kale,” he said aloud, forcing the sound of his own name to ground him. “You’re just jumpy. Pipes and coolant flow. Nothing else.”

But deep down, he wasn’t sure.

The clicking noise didn’t return, but as Kale left the room, the hum seemed to follow him, growing fainter with every step.

**Log Entry 3**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.03**

**Engineer Kale** 

I don’t know how to explain this without sounding insane, but I swear I saw space move. Not a ship, not a meteor—space itself. It was like watching a wave ripple across water, except there’s no air, no light to carry a wave. It was subtle, almost imperceptible, but I know what I saw.

I told Rena, but she brushed it off. She thinks I’m just tired. Maybe she’s right. The engines are running perfectly, but they feel wrong. There’s a vibration that wasn’t there before—so subtle, you’d miss it if you weren’t listening for it. And the clicking is back. Louder this time, like it’s pacing just beyond the bulkhead. I’ve checked every system, every pipe. Nothing’s out of place. Nothing explains the sound. Elias says we’ll adjust course again tomorrow. He says we’ll be fine. I’m not so sure.

**Dinner Tensions**

The mess hall was too quiet. The faint hum of the ship’s systems, the clinking of utensils on metal trays—these were the only sounds breaking the oppressive silence. Even the air felt heavier here. Kale sat hunched over his meal, poking at the gray protein cubes on his tray. Across from him, Rena was scrolling through her tablet, her eyes flicking rapidly over lines of data.

“Come on,” Kale said, his voice louder than he intended. “We’re explorers, right? We’re supposed to find weird stuff like this.”

Rena didn’t look up. “There’s a difference between finding something weird and finding something impossible.”

Kale frowned, setting down his fork. “So you think it’s impossible now?”

“I think it defies the laws of physics, Kale,” she snapped, finally meeting his gaze. “That doesn’t make it interesting. It makes it dangerous.”

Kale opened his mouth to retort, but Elias spoke first.

“Enough.”

The single word cut through the room like a knife. He didn’t raise his voice, but there was a sharpness to it that made both of them fall silent. Elias leaned back in his chair, his hands folded neatly on the table.

“We’re all feeling the strain,” he said quietly. “But turning on each other isn’t going to help. Let’s focus on what we can control.”

For a moment, no one spoke. Rena went back to her tablet, though her fingers moved slower now. Kale stared at his tray, appetite gone. The tension in the room was palpable, thick enough to choke on.

Elias picked up his fork and took a slow, deliberate bite of his meal. He didn’t look up, but his words hung in the air. “We knew what we signed up for when we joined this mission. Deep space is unpredictable. Unforgiving. But we’re trained. Let’s not forget that.”

Kale muttered something under his breath, too quiet for anyone to hear, and pushed back his chair. He grabbed his tray and headed for the disposal chute without a word. As he left, the low hum of the ship seemed to grow louder, filling the empty space he left behind.

**Log Entry 4**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.04**

**Commander Elias**

The anomaly is growing.

Rena estimates it will encompass the ship within forty-eight hours unless we change course. We've tried plotting an escape trajectory, but the navigational systems are behaving erratically. Forward momentum persists, but the term forward feels increasingly meaningless here.

Kale’s paranoia is escalating. He insists he hears clicking noises in the engine room and swears they’re not mechanical. He’s exhausted, barely eating or resting, and I’ve ordered him to stand down for a shift. It’s for his own good, though he seemed reluctant to leave his post.

I’m not sleeping much either. Last night, I dreamed I was outside the Helios, untethered, the void stretching endlessly in every direction. I turned back, expecting to see the ship, but it wasn’t there. Just the void, pulsing in silence.

**-The Dream-**

Elias woke with a start, his breath hitching in his chest. His cabin was bathed in faint red emergency light—the result of the Helios’ standard night cycle. Still, the room felt oppressive, too warm despite the environmental controls. He rubbed his face with trembling hands, trying to shake the remnants of the dream. It had felt so real.

In the dream, the void had been silent, yet it roared inside him, drowning out everything else. He had floated there, weightless, surrounded by the endless black, his tether to the ship severed. He remembered twisting his body, searching for the Helios.

There had been nothing. Nothing except a ripple. It hung in the void like a wound, distorting the space around it. No light, no shadow—just a formless pulse that seemed to stretch and contract in a rhythm too slow, too deliberate to be natural.

But the worst part wasn’t the ripple itself. It was the way it made him feel. Elias had felt his mind unraveling in its presence. Memories slipped through his fingers like grains of sand. He couldn’t remember his name, his purpose, or why he was floating in the first place. The ripple didn’t just distort space; it distorted him.

He pressed his feet into the cold grating of the floor now, grounding himself in the present. The hum of the ship was faint but steady—a lifeline anchoring him to reality. Elias closed his eyes, but the ripple lingered behind his eyelids. Almost like a silent watcher.

**Log Entry 5**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.05**

**Lieutenant Rena**

The distortion is no longer just making us jumpy and paranoid. It’s affecting the ship.

Systems are behaving erratically. We’ve logged multiple instances of resets—environmental stabilizers, temperature controls, even the navigation console. It’s as if the Helios is glitching, though every diagnostic check shows no faults. There are discrepancies, too. Timestamps on logs that don’t align. Supplies missing from storage that were there a day ago. Kale claims to have seen someone walking the corridors last night, but when he called out, they disappeared around the corner.

I want to believe it’s just stress—isolated hallucinations brought on by fatigue. But the numbers don’t lie. The ripple is expanding, and its effects are growing. It’s not just warping space; it’s warping us and the ship.

**-The Corridor-**

The corridor was dim, the overhead red lights flickering sporadically. Kale stood frozen, his back against the bulkhead, straining to listen. The clicking sound was louder now, sharper, echoing unevenly through the metal hallway. It didn’t come from the walls or the ship’s systems. It sounded... intentional. Like something was trying to be noticed.

“Hello?” Kale’s voice cracked, barely above a whisper.

Nothing answered.

He took a cautious step forward, his boots scuffing against the floor. His hand hovered over the comm panel on his wrist, but he didn’t activate it. Something primal—a gut instinct buried deep in his subconscious—told him not to call for help.

Another step. The clicking stopped.

Kale let out a shaky breath, trying to steady himself. “Just the pipes,” he muttered. “It’s always the damn pipes.”

But as he turned the corner, he froze. A figure stood at the far end of the corridor. It was faint, almost translucent, but its shape was unmistakably humanoid.

“Who’s there?” Kale called out, his voice firmer now.

The figure didn’t move. Its edges seemed to flicker and shift, as though it existed in two places at once. Kale blinked, and it was gone.

His breath came in shallow gasps as he backed away, his mind racing. He thought about calling Elias, about telling someone—anyone—what he had seen. But when he looked down at his wrist COMM, the timestamp was wrong.

It read: Mission Date: 2837.14.04. Kale stared at the numbers, his heart pounding. That was yesterday.

**Log Entry 6**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.06**

**Commander Elias**

We’ve lost our course.

No matter what adjustments we make, the navigation systems keep looping us back toward the ripple. Every route curves back like a snake devouring its own tail. It feels as though space itself has turned against us, conspiring to trap us in this void.

Rena is convinced the anomaly is warping more than just space—it’s affecting time. She suggested we might be reliving the same moments without realizing it, our memories splintered and incomplete, like corrupted data files. I don’t want to believe her, but...

This morning, I walked into the mess hall and saw Kale eating breakfast. Nothing unusual, except I could’ve sworn I’d seen the exact same scene yesterday: same position, same tray, same conversation.

When I mentioned it to Rena, she didn’t react—just stared at me, her face pale and hollow. “You said that yesterday, too,” she whispered.

We need to get out of here.

**-The Loop-**

The cockpit was bathed in the dim glow of the navigation console, its surface flickering faintly. Elias stood rigid before it, his eyes fixed on the blank star chart. The only point of reference was the Helios, a solitary marker adrift in an ocean of nothingness.

Ahead of them, the ripple pulsed faintly—a distortion in the black void, its edges impossible to define. Elias felt its presence as much as he saw it, a gnawing sensation at the back of his mind that grew stronger the longer he stared.

The hiss of the cockpit door startled him, and he turned to see Rena step inside. She looked smaller than usual, her shoulders hunched and her dark hair pulled back in a loose, unkempt tie. Her tablet was tucked tightly against her chest, her knuckles white.

“Still nothing?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Still nothing,” Elias replied. His own voice sounded distant, detached. “I’ve recalibrated the system three times. Every route we plot—doesn’t matter the direction—curves back toward the distortion.”

Rena’s lips tightened. She shifted on her feet, staring at the console as though it might reveal some hidden answer. “You know what this means, right?”

Elias turned back to the screen. His hands gripped the console’s edge so tightly that his knuckles ached. “Say it anyway.”

“It’s not us chasing the anomaly,” Rena said softly. “It’s the anomaly pulling us in.”

Elias exhaled slowly, the weight of her words settling over him. He leaned forward, pressing his palms against the console.

“Have you noticed anything... off?” he asked, his voice quiet but strained.

Rena blinked. “Off how?”

Elias hesitated, searching for the right words. “Moments that feel... repeated. Like we’ve done them before. Conversations we’ve already had.”

Rena’s brow furrowed, but she didn’t answer.

“This morning,” Elias continued, “I saw Kale in the mess hall. Same spot, same tray, same exact conversation. I know I saw it yesterday, but when I brought it up to him...” He shook his head, trailing off.

Rena stared at him, her face pale.

The silence that followed was suffocating. The hum of the ship, once a comforting constant, now felt ominous—like the low growl of a predator circling its prey.

Rena looked down at her tablet, her fingers trembling as she flipped through the logs. “Elias,” she said, her voice tight, “look at this.”

She held the tablet out to him. The logs were there, neatly timestamped—but the dates didn’t make sense. Entries he remembered writing yesterday were marked as days ago, while others he was certain were recent were listed as weeks old.

“What the hell is this?” Elias muttered, scrolling through the entries. The further he looked, the worse it got. Time itself seemed fractured, with no coherent progression.

“I don’t know,” Rena said. “But I think it’s getting worse.”

Elias looked back at the ripple. It pulsed steadily, as if it was alive. He didn’t say it aloud, but the thought gnawed at him: What if we’re already too late?

**Log Entry 7**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.06**

**Lieutenant Rena**

The distortion’s growth rate has accelerated. I could’ve sworn we measured it yesterday and calculated two days until it would envelop us, but now it’s as if we’ve lost time.

Kale suggested we set a timer to monitor the loop. A simple test: leave a clock running in the mess hall, synced to the ship’s main chronometer. When we checked it this morning, it read 2837.14.02.

That’s impossible. Elias refuses to acknowledge it outright, but I can see the doubt in his eyes. He knows something is wrong. The ripple isn’t just consuming space—it’s rewriting it.

**-The Meeting-**

The crew gathered in the dimly lit meeting room, their expressions ranging from exhaustion to unease. The holographic star chart floated above the center of the table, its usual bright, precise display now warped with faint glitches.

Rena leaned forward, her hands splayed on the cold metal surface of the table. “The clock’s not broken,” she said, her voice sharp and unyielding. “It’s the ripple. It’s warping time itself.”

Kale scoffed, leaning back in his chair with a forced nonchalance that didn’t match the tension in his jaw. “So, what? Space is gaslighting us now? We’re losing hours, days, just because this thing says so?”

“It’s not a joke, Kale,” Rena snapped, her tone cutting through the room like a scalpel. “Think about it. The logs don’t match up. The clock’s out of sync. Supplies we inventoried yesterday are missing today. How do we even know today is today?”

Elias, seated at the head of the table, raised a hand to cut her off. “Enough,” he said, his voice low but commanding. He pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes for a brief moment. When he spoke again, his tone softened, but the weight of command still hung heavy in his words. “We’re not here to argue. We need solutions.”

“There’s no solution,” Rena replied, her voice quieter now but no less certain. “Not unless we can find a way out of the void. And right now, we’re trapped. Every course we plot circles back to the anomaly.”

Kale shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his gaze drifting toward the star chart. The ripple dominated the display, a slow, rhythmic distortion that seemed to pulse in time with the ship’s systems.

“Maybe we’re thinking about this all wrong,” he said reluctantly. “What if... what if it’s not pulling us in? What if we’re the ones causing it? Like...” He trailed off, struggling for the right words. “Like some kind of feedback loop. What if being here makes it grow?”

Rena’s eyes narrowed. “That’s a hell of a leap, Kale. Based on what, exactly?”

“I don’t know,” Kale admitted. “Just a feeling. The way the engines vibrate—it’s like they’re out of sync with everything else. Like the ship’s fighting against itself.”

Elias let out a slow breath, his gaze fixed on the pulsing ripple. “Feelings aren’t enough. We need data. Rena, can you run another scan? Focus on the ripple’s interaction with the ship’s systems.”

Rena hesitated, her hands tightening into fists. “I can try. But I’m telling you, Elias, this thing isn’t just warping space or time. It’s warping us. Our perceptions, our memories—everything.”

For a moment, no one spoke. The faint hum of the ship’s systems filled the silence, a fragile reminder that they were still alive, still tethered to some semblance of normalcy. Then, as if on cue, the star chart flickered violently, its image collapsing into static before reforming. The ripple pulsed once more, its presence dominating the room like a heartbeat.

Elias straightened in his chair, his jaw tight. “Whatever’s happening,” he said, his voice steady, “we need to stay focused. If we panic, we’re done.”

Rena nodded reluctantly, though her eyes lingered on the distorted chart. Kale, meanwhile, glanced toward the corridor as if expecting to see another shadow lurking just beyond the door. The void was closing in, and they all felt it—that their time, whatever that meant now, was running out.

**Log Entry 8**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.04**

**Engineer Kale** 

I’m starting to think Rena’s right. About the time, I mean. Yesterday—if it was yesterday—I ran a diagnostic on the engines. Everything checked out. Today, I ran it again, and the logs said it hadn’t been done in three days.

But here’s the thing: I remember doing it. I remember the wrench slipping out of my hand and hitting my foot. I still have the bruise.

The clicking noise is louder now. It’s following me. Every time I turn around, it stops, but I can feel it—just out of sight. I told Elias. He said it’s just the stress. But he’s lying. I can see it in his eyes.

He’s hearing it too.

**-The Shadows-**

The dim corridors of the Helios felt smaller than usual, the walls closing in as Kale made his way back to the engine room. His flashlight cast a weak, wavering beam that flickered with every step, like it too was afraid of the void encroaching on the ship.

The clicking followed him. Soft at first, like nails tapping against metal.

Click. Click-click. Click.

“Come on,” he whispered to himself, his breath fogging in the chill air. “It’s just the pipes. It’s always the pipes.”

The sound stopped abruptly, leaving a silence so profound it seemed to press against his ears. Kale froze, his flashlight sweeping the corridor ahead. And that’s when he saw it.

A shadow, impossibly black, moved along the far wall. It slid with an unnatural fluidity, its edges blurring like smoke against the harsh lines of the ship. It wasn’t cast by anything. It was the shadow.

Kale’s breath caught as the figure paused, shifting slightly as if watching him. His heart pounded in his chest, the sound deafening in the oppressive silence. Then, like liquid draining from a broken vessel, the shadow collapsed into the floor and disappeared. Kale stumbled back, his flashlight trembling in his grip. He stood there, paralyzed, until the clicking started again—this time behind him.

**Log Entry 9**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.02**

**Commander Elias**

Something is wrong with the logs.

Rena pointed it out this morning—entries are appearing out of order. Timestamps don’t align. Our internal clock now says it’s the second day in the void, but I distinctly remember making a log on what should’ve been the sixth or seventh. I honestly don't know anymore.

We’re losing our grip on reality. The ripple is closer now, visible from every viewport. It pulses like a living thing, its rhythm syncing with the ship’s systems. The crew’s tension is palpable. Kale insists he saw something in the corridors last night—a shadow that moved on its own. Rena called it a hallucination, but I’m not so sure.

The void feels alive.

**-A Conversation in the Void-**

Elias found Rena standing in the observation bay, her silhouette framed by the faint blue light of the ripple outside. It twisted and pulsed beyond the viewport, a distortion that seemed to pull at the edges of the ship’s reality.

“It’s almost beautiful,” she murmured, her breath fogging the glass.

“It’s dangerous,” Elias replied, his tone clipped.

“Maybe it’s both,” Rena said, her voice laced with a quiet reverence. She turned to face him, her eyes wide and glinting in the dim light. “Have you ever seen anything like it, Elias? It’s like it’s alive. Like it knows we’re here.”

“That’s exactly why we need to get out of here,” he said, crossing his arms.

Rena shook her head, her gaze drifting back to the ripple. “What if this isn’t just an anomaly? What if it’s... something more? A doorway. A consciousness. Something we were never meant to see.”

Elias tensed. “We can’t afford to think like that. If we lose focus—”

“What if it’s already too late?” Rena interrupted, her voice rising. “What if it’s not just pulling us in but changing us? What if we’re not who we were when we came here?”

He opened his mouth to respond but faltered. Her words hung heavy in the air, resonating with a fear he hadn’t dared to voice. Instead, he looked out at the ripple, its pulsing rhythm syncing with the subtle hum of the ship. “We need answers,” he said finally, though his voice carried little conviction.

“And what if the answer is something we can’t understand?” Rena asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Elias didn’t reply. He couldn’t. Because deep down, he suspected she was right.

**Log Entry 11**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.09**

**Commander Elias**

We’re unraveling.

The ripple looms closer, its pulse a constant reminder of how little time—if time still exists—we have left. I can feel it pressing on me, on all of us. Rena is obsessing over theories, trying to quantify something unquantifiable. Kale barely speaks, except to himself or the ship's AI. And me? I’m not sure I trust myself anymore.

The logs are becoming nonsensical. Events I remember clearly aren’t written down, while things I swear never happened are appearing with my name attached.

**-Fractures in Reality-**

Elias ran his hand over his face, the faint stubble a reminder of how long it had been since he’d cared about appearances. The cockpit lights flickered again, plunging him into semi-darkness before stabilizing. The ship was alive with these malfunctions now—small glitches that hinted at something larger, something insidious.

The door hissed open, and Rena strode in, her tablet clutched tightly in one hand. Her eyes were wide, frantic, darting around the room like she expected to find something lurking in the shadows.

“We need to talk,” she said, her voice trembling but firm.

Elias nodded slowly, gesturing for her to sit, but she shook her head, pacing instead.

“I checked the logs again,” she began, her words tumbling out in a rush. “There’s an entry marked as mine from two days ago. It talks about recalibrating the sensors and rerouting power to the engines. But I didn’t write it, Elias. I don’t remember doing that.”

Elias’s stomach tightened. He’d read the same entry earlier, brushing it off as a mistake. “Are you sure?” he asked, though he already knew the answer.

Rena stopped pacing, fixing him with a desperate look. “Of course I’m sure! The logs—our memories—are being rewritten. It’s not just time that’s broken, Elias. It’s us.”

He opened his mouth to reply, but the ship shuddered violently, the lights dimming for a moment before flaring back to life. The ripple was closer now, its pulsing rhythm echoing faintly through the hull. Rena gripped the edge of the console, her knuckles white. “It’s like it’s... feeding off us,” she whispered.

Elias stood, placing a hand on her shoulder. “We’re not giving in to that. Whatever this thing is, it doesn’t control us.” She looked up at him, her eyes filled with doubt. “Doesn’t it? How do we even know we’re real anymore?”
