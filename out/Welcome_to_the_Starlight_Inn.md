I've worked at this hotel for a couple months now, but man, do I already have a great many WILD ass stories to share, I figure documenting these things online is probably the best course of action, seeing as most of my job involves sitting at a terminal with a halfway passable internet connection.

I suppose before I go any further I should introduce myself, hello! My name is JC. I'm from a small town in the middle of nowhere Oregon, hosting a population of about 500, nestled pretty deep in the mountain passes that separate the lush green of the Willamette National Forest and the desolate wasteland that leads into Idaho. In my quaint little town, there exists a lone gas station that still uses analog pumps, one school that teaches everything from Pre-K through High School, a grocery store that SOMETIMES gets it's deliveries within a week of when they're placed, and a police station with a whopping two officers (their names are Paul and Gary, all things considered, really nice guys!)

The hotel I work for is called the Starlight Inn, a hotel that so strangely contrasts the rest of this town. Something you need to know about where I live is that, upon entering, you will feel as though you've travelled back into the 1940s, seeing as that's about when everything here was built. Being as far out of the way as we are, we aren't exactly on the radar for real estate or commercial developers, hell, hardly anyone knows we even exist. This hotel though? It seemed to pop up out of nowhere three years ago. In comparison to the halfway dry-rotten houses, grocery store the size of maybe 3/4 of a basketball court and a gas station that doesn't even have an overhang, this hotel looks like it was ripped straight out of a sci-fi movie. Pristine white walls, with marble flooring and a pool so chlorinated the water inside your body feels cleaner even being near it.

I was going through our town's newspaper when I saw an ad that popped out at me:

**"The Starlight Inn is now hiring an Overnight Auditor, No Experience Necessary - $25/hr"**.

I'd just lost my job at the grocery store about a week prior, and this felt like it was too good to be true.

**"Just come in with your resume and ask for Isaac for an interview"**.

So I did exactly that. I got onto my shitty little laptop I bought from a Goodwill last year on a trip to the valley, opened up Microsoft Word, and quickly drafted quite possibly the worst resume anybody had ever seen. I'd never written a resume before, so I just put down "Maelstrom Hills Grocery Store - Cashier (2020 - 2024)", my name and phone number, and absolutely nothing else. No real formatting, no header, nothing. I printed this "resume" off and made my trek 30 minutes across and ever so slightly outside of town to this Art Deco anomaly that sat just far enough away to not completely distract every single person who lives here.

Upon entering, I was greeted by a man behind the front desk who was IMPECCABLY dressed. A solid black tuxedo, white tie, white gloves and a smile that almost seemed a bit TOO big. He asked if I was there to check in, to which I responded that I was here about the job listing, inquiring further if Isaac was around. He had responded in an unnervingly cheery tone that he was in fact Isaac, who then proceeded to hold out his hand almost expectantly, before clarifying that he wanted my resume. It was at this moment the reality of the situation hit me. I just walked into this spotless, almost futuristic looking hotel in dirty jeans, a polo with an ever-growing hole in the side and torn-up knock-off Timberland boots. I very sheepishly handed him my resume, expecting to be sent away without a second thought. Needless to say, you can imagine my surprise when the VERY NEXT thing he asked me was when I could come in for a fitting, as he wants all of his employees to adhere to the company's dress code and that meant I'd need a suit tailored.

The tailor process was pretty simple. I came in the day after the resume drop-off, and a man with a thick German accent took measurements from neck to toe. After the measurements, I was brought into Isaac's office, a fairly grandiose room with a mahogany desk, jet black leather chair that I'm fairly certain had a massage function, and.... although it could just be me, this room felt WAY bigger than it should have been. Not like TARDIS-level bigger on the inside, but just enough that it was worth noting. I was sat down across from Isaac and was passed a considerable stack of paperwork. NDAs out the ass, which I would imagine would be bizarre for a hotel, especially considering one of them was meant to render me unable to even acknowledge Isaac's existence to anyone else. What I DID notice, however, was the lack of documentation I SHOULD HAVE had to fill out. There were no tax documents, nothing to identify who I was, nothing. Just NDAs and waivers so thick you'd think I was signing on to work for Marvel.

Every night so far has been the same. I come in, I sit in the office, reconcile the frankly strange amount of transactions that come through for a hotel so far out of the way of EVERYTHING, I fill out the paperwork that comes with those reconciliations, I brew coffee every once in a while, the sun rises, and then I go home. I get paid every week, on Monday, like clockwork, exactly at 3 AM. I haven't seen Isaac since my orientation, which was fucking bonkers in and of itself, as you'll soon learn.

There's so much more I need to say, but for now I'll leave you with this:

Starlight Inn is a fucking WEIRD place. Not just because of it's eccentric manager, or it's uncanny appearance, or the weird CIA-level documentation I had to sign..

I don't know how to put it into words. Have you ever met someone that was just... off? You couldn't shake that feeling that something was just TERRIBLY wrong with them, and yet you couldn't explain why you feel that way?

Just imagine that feeling, but surrounding an entire building, almost as if it shouldn't exist.

My name is JC, I've been a night auditor for the Starlight Inn for two months, three weeks, six days.

And I have a very strong feeling tomorrow will be different.
