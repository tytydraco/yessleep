I checked the video on my phone and saw myself frantically trying to open the door. The timestamp reads 2:48 AM. I looked at my phone. It's 2:37 AM.

I got up to get water, still a little groggy. What the hell was that? After I got down, I noticed that the backdoor was open. I decided to go outside. 

When I put my feet out, the glass door closed behind me. I turned around and at the door was a man with a rabbit mask and a dark suit. He put his hand on his pulse like it was a watch, and made the sound of tick-tock.

I looked at my phone. 2:38 AM. I turned and saw a man that looked like me running. He tripped and fell. I went to help him and watched, as I watched what looked like the same man in a dark suit and rabbit mask approaching the guy on the floor with a knife. The other me tried to stand up but screamed in pain. He looked at me and started to try and say something, but the rabbit man stopped him, saying that maybe I would get lucky next time. Crap, I am the next time.

I ran in the opposite direction and started to hit my neighbor's door when I remembered that tomorrow is memorial day and he and everybody was traveling, including my wife and kids that left earlier today to her parent's lake house because I had work. Great, my boss is going to be the cause of my death.

I grabbed my phone. No signal. 2:42 AM. How this suburban nightmare doesn't have a signal I don't know. I looked around and saw the O'duggan's house with a light on. Right, their teenage son, Bobby, murdered his Spanish teacher, and he got an account of manslaughter and got home prison.

When I got there it was 2:45. How did it take 3 minutes to walk half a block? I knocked on the door and he answered. 

"Please help me, I'm being chased by a man with a rabbit mask and a..." He was wearing a dark suit and had a rabbit mask on his hand

"Tick, tock." He said and I ran.

I went in the direction of my house, but the space between his house and mine seemed to dilate. I grabbed my phone. 2:48 AM. I got to my house and started to violently try to break my door. He was near me and I ran to the side to jump the lateral fence. 

I fell hard and broke my ankle. I tried to keep running but tripped on one of my son's decorative rocks. I tried to stand up but screamed in pain. I looked to the side and there was the version of me who just got locked outside of the house. I tried to make him run and don't come back but it was too late. Bobby put a hand on my mouth

"Maybe you will get lucky next time."
