The "Familiar" Mill West; an Autobiographical Account of the World at Large  
	  
PART 1(INTRODUCTION)  
 Hello my dear /eerrh well, that's too much for right now/. Just \_hello\_ I guess. She's not been in the picture for a while you see and I am starting to get anxious, but more on that later  
 this story has to start not finish. I am Mill West, this is my account, and well, I am familiar to fewer than the title entails. "They" call me West though. She-  
  
 He smirked.  
  
 "She calls me Mill" he said outloud in a whisper for the first time, and happily too.  
  
 /Another first/ he thought with her by his side only in the mind.  
  
 "I didn't know she did that" he slipped past his tongue commenting on his strange manner of speech while by /her/ side.  
  
 I guess I should explain what going on already, but too much happens for this to happen in the typical format. To be concise I am talking to you with my brain more than letters on a page  
 and by doing this I end up missing most literary cues that normally occur.  
  
 "That's what he says but I disagree" she projected into his mind.  
  
 I hope this is alright as my work is too mysterious to be talked, written, and (especially for me) even thought.  Just clarifying I will do my best but my tone may seem off, just read  
 what is written and hope that /he/ makes enough sense \_eerrh sorry again, /that/ was HER talking\_.   
  
 "Quite embarrassing" he thought hoping that his makeshift /italics/ and \_bolds\_ didn't clash with their inability to appear in this ancient format. The MIN-\*cough\* Notepad \*cough\*-D.  
  
 His brained cried at him that he should WRITE this out but his handwriting was too illegible, it cried again for HER as it might just be the job she would have to take on with her MD worthy  
 chicken scratch handwriting.   
  
 Still better than mine he thought.  
  
 "I just wish she was here" said almost too audible drawing some attention from his fellow train riders.    
  
 I can't say where I am as its work and like I am trying to get to; it is both dangerous and mysteriously macabre in nature. Like the insanity causing whispers that drive would be politicians  
 to madness. Or the things that drive sailors into dangerous waters, Siren Songs of unknown origin. I argue that it is just the mind and that's not just me \*wink\*. Anyways, now is the time for sharing and I am   
 finding myself unable to elaborate. I guess we will start with the broadcast /or maybe not/ she chimed. The Mill West one /STOP/ she projected into my head, or at least I hope it was her. Maybe these thing have already seized my and her consciousnesses…  
/Sorry/ I projecte into her head/  
  
 Why'd I throw her under the bus? Just to make me feel less alone I guess. Might just be m- and a cold electric shock flew up his spine and spun his eyeballs almost out of there sockets  
 like a sneeze with your eyes open. With two broken orbitals he added wickedly; smirking en toe disturbing his fellow train riders. Was he getting too roudy.-e.  
  
 "Might just be m, m, m, me e, e, e!?!" he stutter horribly and far to loudly for his now snickering audience on the train.  
    
 I, uhm, pardon me this will be for another time. Its time for me to talk about me. Not those retched primordial demons from space...(I assume at least, I guess we will move along to the first part then).  
 Just after I get safe. You never seem to know who's safe these days. And in a flash he moved seats and hoped for her to chime in with some wise crack about how he always knows what to do, but nothing   
 came, not even a My Dear.  
  
 "Now that we are aquainted, at least as much as I am with anybody. We can discuss my work." he growled carefully but somehow rudely.   
  
 The attention from his fellow passengers scared him but before it got to him he was speaking, eeerrrrh, uhhh, writing, or aaahhh, telecommunicating via the mind. I don't know just listen.   
  
 My work is political, but where it takes me is a bit more grand. The types of people that you meet in my line of work vary far and wide. Spies, bonafide politicians, barons of industry,  
 ecofascists(some of whom I think to much alike), and even a few women someof whom are the preceding, but all of them tackle the world in a much stranger way. Some are madames of brothels, cartel personnel and even Lily(she's HER). These people tend to be unsavory to most but I have found them to fit quite nicely into my humble little life as a familiar, ghost, or a singular  
 men in gray suites(which ever you prefer).  
  
 "All three!" she spoke to me softly from wherever she was now.  
  
 /I miss you/ we said to each other.  
  
 That's pretty much it I guess, without getting into anecdotes(seen below). But that enough from me for now. You will hear from her next of you are listening, reading, or whatever else-ing  
 in order.  
  
 Thank you and good night!  
   
  
To the man seeing burning treez,  
I know who you are and that they are looking for you. These ancient psuedo-hallucinations that attack the mind not unlike a parasites or even a predator. Perhaps these /things/ are  
just ancient whispers of human evolution projecting themselves into existence to any given individual in the gene pool like a genetic puppet show (or A-T:G-C kabuki theater as I like the  
call it). <<More on that later please  
Anyways Mill or erhhh aahh... West, as they call you out there. I glad you finally made contact with me.  
Can we chat somehow a little more private, please and thank you, oh you done it. That great me boy now just keep knodding and talking. What do /we/ do next.  
This concludes the Mill West broadcast. Thanks for tuning into the show tonight and remember we're watching you. :)  
  
  
PART 2(THE CHESIRE SCREAMS)  


TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ The Po-ry? The Stor-em? idk TREEZ their cool.TREEZ TREEZ   
 TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ TREEZ   
  
Taking a walk on a path thats close my mind is colored sentimental and neon flavored. My eyes tell lies but the pipe gives good vibes. For a while. But more on that  
later. The walk started of nice. Fall-ter(Win-tunm?) trees looking craggy and full of menace with a mind even fuller I walk the lands with pep in my step and  
vibes all around. The one that I'm with seems to here the menacing whisper while my own mind strings together stories of something I rather not say. Not quite dark  
but not something to rest on. As the colors grow louder and the cragginess of the trees begins to guide the mind I start to wonder if there is some way out of here.  
  
A blast and a zip through the highlands proved potent. Legs tired and food aquired I'm ready for a recharge. The trees once their run of the mill creepy are now the  
least of my worries. This building that seemed so plain before are now twisting and warping my mind with the things that they hold. All the people and business must  
be a strong wavelength as the building is wibbly before my own eyes. But time for the recharge. A puff puff pass that passes the time as time and decision sink in  
ever deeper I worry that there is no way out. Oh god oh no. Its not the trees that I am worried about but my own mind. Not the tress I saw before not the building  
wibbly. But thicket, no not the one by the water just of the path but the thoughts in my mind that push me somewhere with less control. Where the rocks I carry   
are darker, or heavier or something that I don't think I like.  
  
Back on the path now but those heavy thought hang in the air. My partner in this expedition of ... well something? not quite sure, a little hard to explain, and   
well complicated. and I don't really want to say. but it was something for sure. certain in fact.   
  
Before I could think another thought those trick-sy trees grab me. Or was it, is it, are /they/ the heaviness I felt before. In the thicket. Wait, I've felt this   
pull before, not quit STOP but close. What is this.   
  
The more I think it the more that it lingers so I clear my head.   
A different path might be better the trees are in our heads.  
  
Too many people at this stoplight so lucid. But real and not quite. Why is it so slow why won't it change. Why does it, did it, will it? Feel like there someone  
else in my /thoughts/. Not quite my brain but something deeper. No one in control the central governor gone and the driver has left. Distracted by what used to be  
in those wibbly building. Its just me and there is noone in control. Could /I/ be?  
  
"This way"  
Oooohh I can be. Bigger scary, not good, the thoughts were not mine but what if they were. Or were they the tree's those fucking craggly wibbly trees mocking me.  
Don't laugh I just trying to figure out what is going on. I'm new here what do you want me to do. I not even the one in control. I'm not the on who created this.  
  
Wait is the one who created this the one who is control.  
  
The cold of the evening and the weight of earlier thought sink in. The stoplight of course/the thicket/. SHSHHHHHHSHSHSH  
Don't think that.   
I must stay strong it seems like I might have to be the one who is in control /the thicket/ SSHSHSHHSHSHSHHS nonononoSHSHSHS.  
  
Slo‌wing down is only making me colder and we need a morale boost. A steady hand on the shoulder, an inperceptable glow and we are moving again. Back to the warmth of  
where we started(my house but like whatever).  
  
Step step shhshsh step step step.  
Easy moving. Nothing to worry about. The thicket from before was not even a big deal. Who know if it was even real?  
/It was real and so the thicket/   
The thicket is always there so what. Waiting for when the mind wanders to far and begins to crack. Or is it an even horizon? Couldn't be I no still in it am I.  
Its always there ya know. Just waiting for a weak?, compromised? acidic? mind to push the wrong buttons.  
This thicket was more thicketer than the other but it pushed to hard to early and it means almost nothing. Not quite apathy. A nasty spice that can ruin a thought  
with a- well feeling(pathy).   
The path is different now. A bit more shadowy but the walk home feels like a yellow brick road. Just follow this and it will be smooth sailing. The thicket shook me  
up and I hope my companion couldn't tell. Moving forward, a bit faster, and annoyingly- a bit colder.  
  
Step step step. /THE THICKET/ shhshshsh. I dont want to thinkg that anymore I don't know what it is and the voices are telling me that I have to add something  
but they don't know what it means to go through this it is stronger than anyone know even the fake creator thinks can best me.   
Fuck them. Go through it yourself just know that the steps I took were bigger than you think and heavier than you and trying to imagine.  
Don't read between the lines. Read my lips. Don't go through it because it won't be what you expect. Do you want the same situation? The same scenario?  
How do you thing this carbon copy works. Just placing you on my shoulder won't work you have to feel the real fear. Just throwing you in the deep-end won't work,   
you won't believe me. Do you think you can mimick my foot steps. That's the only way to see what I saw. Not a snoot not a high horse but a simple fact. For  
/you/ to feel what I felt you have to be me. You have have to feeling I felt stuffed into that stupid little self-centered, unwavering, and unthinking head of yours   
or you can sign up for the dialed down haunted house. I bigger and better and you don't even know. You fucks demand perfection and the story almost was. Not perfect  
but wrapped up which is good enough for me. How do you translate a single person's experience into a language someone else can speak. A simple algorithim that changes  
vibes to fit what you think, know, and feel. What are capable of and what you are not. What if this would break me but not you and you but not me. How do you  
know that you aren't just asking to be sent to hell. Could you convince yourself that this /thicket/ ever leaves. Its a heavy rock that I keep around for   
performances sake. Not a flex not a hardship I will ever outgrow, but something that was a just a little more than the usual. I like the strange, the wacky,  
the wibbly, the scary, and the one the nose. But I can't put this shit on your nose like you think I can. Alice-ese does not translate smoothly into English or German  
or someone-fucking-else-andarin.   
What part of this is so hard to understand. How do you make a subjective experience objective. You can't. But can I make the same amount of subjective. Well...  
yes but you are not ready for that. It would take you loosing grip with what is really going on. You don't want an experience or even a day in a life. You want  
a theme park ride. Something easy to digest and easy to understand and you don't even know it. Thinking you can take anything isn't a matter of being told what is  
going to happen and how it going to go and when the scary part will happen. You have to NOT know. That the hard part to explain because well, not knowing isn't something  
people like. Its the part that /obviously/ needs to be left out.   
WHAT DO YOU MEAN /obviously/!!! That's the whole point. Seeing the /thicket/ so to speak for the first time in this way at that time with that person in that place  
was weird to put it anticlimaticly and existential horrifying to say the least.  
The walk home was not hunky dorey. I saw a thicket bigger than anything I had ever seen before. A thicket with a chesire scream in the trees. An anger in the air.  
A vibration from space. A sky painted murky and ground made of /dark/. Don't know what it means but I went too far and the /thicket/ had a morale to its story.  
"Don't come back here Im not new. I've always been here and I always will be. I'm from space, im ancient, im primordial or what ever the fuck LEAVE NOW".  
  
This vibration were not to be messed with and it was time to leave. The rest of the walk home was gray and dark and apathetic. The next few days decompression  
and the assumsption that this was my mind cracking. Must have been too acid-ic I suppose, don't do that again. But now I see it must have just been the vibration  
of the mind or the thread or whatever you want to call it creeping into my meaty space. The one where the thicket is a be close to the heart and a bit to close  
to that edge. That /Siren Song/ that might just make me jump ship if it get loud enough. But who knows.   
The groggy and foggy and gray-ed out walk home was a strange one. The final stretch was flipped right to left(or was it left to right).\[Not sure\]{HMMM.}  
Anyways that most of it. Gray but like static this time but just in vibe not in the reals. Weight and stuffiness. Couldn't have the /thicket/ return.  
As home grew closer my sense of safety increased and my worries of fatal hypothermia lessened, but that...wasn't all... the /thicket/ was sort of(BIG sort of) what   
I had been looking for. Something bigger than me. Scary shit it was.  
The final turn ahead and my mind think{HUZZAH WARMTH, almost} and a small bush gave me a twinkle. Not the booming(craggly?) menace of the tree that just berated me.  
I'd heard this twinkle before though it was friendly but this time I felt and inkling of suspicion. No /quite/ consciously but enough to make me look twice.  
Friendly enough compared to what I had just seen. I was at the safe point I call "Home" and the video game parellel came back. {Did I mention that already, the stop  
light was glitched and full of NPC's}. Hmm maybe not but this apparently(but not certainly) friendly bush was not quite tree and not quite stop light but signaled something  
in between{ya ya ya, kinda spooky like the tree but glitchy \*no twinkly not quite the same dummmy\* like house you think is your  
 "safe point" /you were in range of safety(not freezing to death or...) dumbass/}  
  
Strange. A bit more jumbled than I first thought. The green \*twinkles\*, the ">gl:itch<>/y" stoplight, and the menacing as craggy looking ass trees/SHHH/{don't be mean}.  
Gulp. {Oh, well don't just leave out the GRAY part you fucking nihilist.} More fuzzy. /SHHHH/  
That just about it. Just a romp through a thicket and nothing about the mind at all.  
{The end.}  
/Thicket/  
Shhh…

PART 2:  
  
Quezalcoatl: The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Guy  
  
The nights are staying long as always but now the existential hue that pains the darkness has begun to eat at my mind. Bogging my sleeping and taking away the serene protection from its dread.  I hope these early morning or sleepless nights or insomnia cures soon. I am running on fumes and it seems the night is a hungry time for everything. These strange thoughts of endurance, which have begun to creep into the mind are the ones that stun me the most– Near synesthetic orgies ”colored up faces” synesthesia of ideas and fears that only strike when defenses are the lowest…  
  
These things or demons or whatever seem to plague my mind and will stop at nothing to encompass all that I perceive. It happened once “on a what” at night and the sky was enveloped in red darkness”cigarette” and the dank smell of a basement”smoke” I will not. A cheshire smile lit up the sky”Accii” a demon of Quezacoatl perhaps and it seemed as though I was struck by something of South American origin. Cursed I have found only tobacco to lend any solace.”Addiction” something I never seen before  
  
I feel myself wasting”already” and now starting to praise those dark demons”memories now”. Their presents enveloping me in a dark, thorny, and fuzzy hue in which I only experience a red hot terror. Why do these demons forsake me?! ”\*Chesire Screams!\*” too terrifying for anything but a tree  
  
“At last when the nicotine runs dry I can continue my life quest in perpetuating their nature; only then will I find a new– \*I can’t help but be possessed by these things\* am I cursed” —-----purpose?  
  
I've just realized the cape upon this menacing figure beckoned respect and prowess. I would have resisted had this thing not already taken a voracious hold. “Too cute” it said
