I am hiding from my friend who decided to throw a massive pool party for everyone in the local area for her birthday party. She was turning 18 and was throwing a huge celebration for it. Our entire neighbourhood wasn’t exactly well off and she was the most wealthy in it, so everyone accepted for the free buffet only, except me. I was friends with her since 5th grade and have spent many sleepovers, shopping trips (you get the idea) with her. One thing that really bother me about her house was the smell though. Everytime we went to her kitchen room the smell of rotting animal meat blocked our noses. And even worse, if it was brought up within any moment we were sitting in the kitchen, the person who mentioned it would be asked to go to the basement bathroom and use this type of numbing gel with a strong smell on their nose.

I arrived at the party early, 10 minutes before it was set. My friend greeted me with a welcoming smile and gestured me in, “What made you come so early?” she asked, I honestly didn’t know how to reply and shrugged. Instantly as we walked down the hall the rotting animal meat smell radiated from the kitchen door, yes it was that strong that even with the door shut it could still be smelt and somehow just as bad. As we walked past the basement door located on the side of the stairs I could have sworn I heard a faint banging and vibration, but I brushed it off.

More people had arrived at this point and we were all sitting in the large spare room, which was only used for playing games, sleepovers or to store that shopping I mentioned. We were all in the middle of a game of truth and dare until an ear-splitting scream came from downstairs, “What was that?” one of the girls asked, turning her head to each of us. “I don’t know..” the friend said, I could tell she was faking it but we were all too scared to notice. The friend, trying to distract us led us down to the pool, it was a pink-ish colour and was claimed to be like that because of a bath bomb.
The friends dad began roasting a variety of meats, all of which smelt like the infamous rotting animal I have mentioned many times. I have to admit though, I don’t know what that meat was but it tasted good. Everyone at the party had consumed it before the music began playing.

Nothing else at the party was interesting until I somehow managed to get locked in the shed after leaving my sunglasses in there. Silence filled the night as I grew hungry. I scavenged around the shed until I found a small hairpin. Perfect. It took me all of 5 minutes to pick the lock and I took a sneak peek into the basement window. I wish I hadn’t. When I tell you I gasped I mean it. At least 3 severed heads with features missing were hung from massive meat hooks under a dim, flickering light bulb. I could then hear a conversation from the kitchen window. The friend and her father sat there, staring blankly at the window, looking straight at me while speaking. They knew. They had a plate of meat, sat in front of them on the counter. And I had to learn the hard way that it was the same meat served at the party.

I’m now hiding in a large bush, I don’t want to be the next victim for the following party. I can see shadow silhouettes shambling through the woods closer to me, if I don’t survive, don’t expect updates. The only updates will be them, or me truthfully. Pray for me I don’t think I’m going to survive by dawn.
