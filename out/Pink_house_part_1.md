Giggles of kids filling the street I'm walking through  
a couple of kids pass by in this late afternoon, where did they plan to go?  
I could see the sun in the horizon  
I saw my watch in my left hand,   
05:47 pm, sunset,   
I took a deep breath, cold air fills my lung,  
I'm in my way from work,   
For context I'm working in new a mall 10 minutes from this neighborhood,   
I've just move here 2 month's ago, in this peacefull neighborhood that I live in, a new mall was just build nearby and I got work there, I m in desperate need of money, and that mall was somehow paying more for the same job than any other place, almost twice,  
Why?......   
I dont know..... I knew that money was good thought,   
So I immediately rent a small apartment room close to my work place  
I've work there for two months now and nothing strange nor it was a hellish place to work, the coworker was pretty nice, nicer than my former office at least, it was just ordinary office, so Im not thinking much about it,  
Im walking with light step toward my home when I see it from afar  
A pink house  
Yes, a pink house  
.  
My step more heavy ever slowly,   
Although even from here I could see its deorerating walls and bleak pink color, grass and trees was growing wildly behind it's iron fence,   
It was a small house, with its pink color wall, the house was clearly has long been abandoned,  
My distance was closer with each step toward the house, with each steps, a story appears from back of my mind, a story people told me ever since I've lived here,   
Story about that pink house......  
"there is a family in that house, a man, his wife and they daughter, a loving family, they loved they daughter so much they give her everything she could want,   
The daughter loves color pink so they paint their house pink, and then they killed their own daughter before fleeing and never To be found......"  
That escalated quickly......I though when I first heard that story,  
It was a classic Horror Story, a bad one at that.....yet..... There is something about this house,   
I've been walk pass by this house for two months now, twice a day, and everytimes I always turn my head toward it, to take a glimpse, just a little curiosity,   
Today wasnt any different, I took a little glismpe of it,   
The house have a small yard, a small iron fence in front of the house, in the left side of the house is a big tree, Im not sure what kind of tree this one is, but it sure big, the tree shadowing the house, covers the house entirely make it dark and creepy even in the middle of a day even more so in afternoon like this one,   
A thrash was all over the yard, here and there was a small thrashs and candy wrapper, there is even many bags of thrash in there,  
Did people throw their thrashes into a haunted houses?   
Brave, I thought,   
I pass the house like anyday for past two months, before I stopped my step abruptly,  
Something caught my attention.....  
Something different......   
In the tree, from behind the tree.....i saw something make my stomach fell  
A strand of hair, swinging lightly in the air,   
"what?......"  
My eyes widen, the hair was moving....   
Not from a wind, the strand of hair was moving lightly, it's someone hair.......its attached to a head......  
A girl....   
No......  
A little girl........   
"no..... " I gasped  
The little girl was peeking from behind the tree, just little, just enough I could see a glimpse of it eyes......i couldnt see its body  
I froze there, unable to move.....  
Then the little girl pulled her head back to hide......   
I took a deep breath, slightly of relieve....  
I want to run away, but my legs feeling weak.......  
Ssss.....ssss  
I heard a noise of rubbing of some kind  
Than I saw the little girl again.....peeking at me......not from where she have been,  
I look up,   
She was above me behind the tree, I could see her head in a branch of a tree,   
Peeking was not correct term,  
She rest her head in the brach of the tree,   
........  
I ran away.......  
......  
She has no body, its just a head in the tree staring at me.......   
Part 2 incoming
