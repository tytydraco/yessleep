I am writing this story from this cabin right now. I don't know if I'll make it out of here alive. I am not even sure what kind of threat I am facing. I should first give you some background on how I ended up here. I won't be going into much detail, I am not sure if I have time for that.



I have lived my whole 23 years in this secluded town. There are currently 57 people living here and we all know each other by first name basis. The town is like an intervening stage between rural and suburban areas. There is a forest around 4-5 km away from the town.



I have only believed in the paranormal when I was a child but after growing up I just thought it didn't make any sense. The elders of the town always warned us of the forest and said it was filled with malevolent spirits. After growing up, I realized that this story was probably to keep children away from the forest so they didn't get lost in t



This thing has been staring at me through the window for half an hour, I don't know what it wants from me. Why is it just staring at me, Why hasn't it killed me yet. It's not moving at all. I have been looking at it trying to anticipate its next move but it's just standing there seemingly doing nothing. I can't go back to writing like this, I don't trust this,

  
It has been an hour now, when I make eye contact with it, my eyes begin to tear up so I have been forcing myself to look at its body. That is until I did look at its face. Its eyes were looking at the door, it had a smile now, its teeth were pearly white, but all of them were canines and neatly arranged. It looked at me again and my eyes felt like they were stung with multiple needles at the same time. I didn't want to close my eyes but my brain didn't care about what I wanted. I tilted my head slightly downwards where I thought I would meet the torso thing of the figure and opened my eyes. It was gone.

  
I have been paranoid ever since it left, it didn't leave a trace behind. The door is still locked and I'm afraid to go outside. The sun has set now. The crickets seem to be silent for some reason. The wind has completely died down. I haven't eaten anything but I am not hungry or thirsty. My head is pounding right now and it feels like some sort of insect is in my head, eating my brain. Now that I think about it, it's been feeling like this ever since I looked at that creature and I had this excruciating tiredness feeling ever since I looked at that thing.



I just want to go to sleep and let my head rest but I do not

trust this place at all. I have been trying to keep track of the time by looking at the moon. I can't see it right now meaning it's right above me. Half of the night has passed. I just need to get through it.



This night feels endless, I have no way to track the time. Why isn’t it ending and where did it go? I don’t know what I prefer, whether to have it on my sight or have no trace of it. I just wish this door and its puny lock can hold it off, although I have no faith in it.



I can’t stay awake anymore, if I die, I die, at least I go in my sleep.



I’m still safe



The night still hasn’t passed?



Did I leave this window wide open? There’s no way I was this careless.



SHIT THE DOOR IS UNLOCKED

  
I made it out of there, I kept running and running and running. Resting under a tree right now, to catch my breath. This forest seems so devoid of life, even trees look scared to make a noise, even the wind seems to be clearing its footsteps while moving.



The silence is killing me. It’s deafening



I need to get up now, even if I can’t run, I have to walk at least.



I smelt something foul so I decided to follow, it led me to a dead body of an animal. Why the fuck is its legs broken. It’s so out of shape, I can’t even tell what it is. Its skin and fur are also pitch black.



This place is terrifying, I need to keep moving. Whoever or whatever did this to the poor animal, I need to stay away from its reach, whether it’s that creature in the cabin or something other than that.



Why is the moon still right above me, it looks like it hasn’t moved an inch. What the hell is going on here? I don’t have time to even think about these things, I need to keep moving.



I’m terrified, if only I stayed away from this, if only I made choices which kept me away from here. I can’t sulk right now, I don’t have time for it. I need to keep moving, whatever happened has happened.



The cricket have started chirping again. I don’t why but I feel relieved that the silence is gone.



I think I see something in the distance, I hope I finally have some place safe to rest, every bone in my body feels like it is about to shatter but I must keep moving.



It looks like a tree house, it looks to be in a good condition at least. I’m going to climb up now.



My breathing has finally calmed down, I’ve been laying here for what felt like an hour.



I see some empty food cans lying around, and now that I think about it, I haven’t eaten anything at all since I’ve been here yet I’m still not craving any food.



Why is the moon still right above me?
