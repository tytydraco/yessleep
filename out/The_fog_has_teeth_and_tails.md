Seven days ago, fog swallowed our street. Avery and I were out taking a walk when we came across a grey wall, roiling and opaque. It stood flush with the stop sign at the intersection and curved smoothly into the backyards on both sides, cutting out a circle of suburbia surrounded by fog.

Wisps of it came off the wall, curling toward us like unspooling fishing lines.

“It’s okay,” Avery said, her voice shaking a little. “We prepared for this.”

Heading home, we pulled out the info sheet and reread it.

**Preparing for Sudden Fog**

*Sudden fog is a natural occurrence caused by changing climate conditions. It will dissipate in 3 to 30 days.*

1. *Print out these instructions. Electronic disruptions during fog have been reported.*
2. *Keep a one-month supply of non-perishable foods and other necessities at all times.*
3. *Do not touch the fog.*

The HOA president had walked down the street a week ago, knocking on every door and handing out copies of the info sheet. She had refused to tell us where the sheet was from, but something about her drawn, serious expression had made us stock up on Campbell’s and Charmin on our next grocery run.

Just in case.

Now I opened my laptop, hoping to Google the phenomenon. But the screen crackled with static, like a CRT TV. Avery tried to call her parents, but an old-school dial tone issued from her smartphone’s speakers.

We dusted off a copy of Spirit Island and played into the night.

Six days ago, our neighbor Martha came to our door, asking for food.

“You know how it is,” she said with a laugh. “I've been meaning to run to Costco, but work has kept me so busy.”

“We only have enough food for ourselves,” I said firmly.

Martha looked from me, to Avery, then back, her mouth opening and closing like a gasping fish.

“You know how it is,” I added.

Martha shook her head and walked away, muttering about bad neighbors. She slammed the front door as she entered her house. Then she went from window to window, drawing the curtains shut.

“Wow, she’s having a temper tantrum,” I said.

“We could’ve given her something,” Avery said uncertainly.

“Eh, we can share if this goes on for more than a few days,” I said. “Come on, I want to play as Lightning this time.”

As we set up another game, I saw Martha’s bedroom curtains stir. Half of her face appeared, with one eye fixed and staring.

But she wasn’t staring at us. She was staring down the street, toward the fog.

Five days ago, we were woken by a scraping sound. Peeking through our blinds, we saw Martha dragging her sofa into her lawn. She settled into it, arms crossed.

She was still sitting in the same position when we got up for breakfast hours later.

“What’s she doing?” asked Avery.

“She’s probably just bored,” I said with a shrug. “Living alone and all.”

But as the sun climbed and sank, Martha’s vigil started to make me uneasy. Whenever I was outside, I stole glances in the direction she was looking.

There was nothing but the fog, sitting thickly at the end of the street.

Four days ago, Avery pushed a box of chicken noodle soup cans into my arms.

“Give those to Martha,” she said.

I started to protest, and she cut me off.

“Look at the poor woman! She’s so hungry she’s losing her mind. Go.”

I squelched my way through grass rotting from the damp.

“Hey Martha,” I said, “we found some spare cans…”

My voice died as she turned toward me. Grey shadows shifted in her irises.

“There’s people in there,” she said. “But not human people. Needle teeth. Fish tails. Hungry.”

“*You’re* hungry,” I said, trying to joke, “and seeing things.” I set the box down.

I walked back quickly.

Three days ago, our dinner of clam chowder and toast was interrupted by screaming. We ran outside.

Martha was stumbling down the street, half-hopping and half-shuffling as if her legs were bound together. Tears ran down her cheeks, and from her throat ripped a shrill, continuous wail. When she reached the fog, she walked into it without slowing down.

The sound immediately stopped.

Avery called 911, but all she got was that dial tone.

Two days ago, we opened our door to fog. It had closed in around our house overnight, and the tendrils now seethed and slithered over themselves inches from our walls.

I went around the house, pulling down all the blinds. When I circled back to the front, Avery had pushed the living room blinds back up and was gazing into the fog.

“What are you doing?” I asked, pulling the blinds down again.

She shook her head, like she was clearing water from her ears. “I saw something,” she said. “A face.”

That night, I woke up alone in bed. Padding to the living room, I found Avery in front of the window, blinds up, facing the fog. In the blackness, I noticed for the first time that the fog glowed slightly, casting a faint, cold light across her wide eyes and parted lips.

“Avery,” I whispered.

She didn’t react.

“Avery!” I said, stepping in front of her.

She blinked, refocusing onto me.

“Don’t look,” I pleaded. “You saw what happened to Martha.”

She made a noncommittal *hmm* sound, but she didn’t meet my eyes.

Yesterday, Avery looked up sharply from our morning game of Spirit Island. “Do you hear that?” she asked.

The house was so silent that I could hear my heartbeat in my ears.

Tears filled her eyes. “It’s so beautiful.”

Then she began to scream.

As she stood up, I threw myself in front of her, but she shoved me aside. With a now-familiar hopping, shuffling gait, she staggered to the door, opened it, and walked into the fog.

I was left with just stillness and myself.

Today, I woke to fog encasing my bed, close enough to touch. All I can reach are my bedding and my cell phone, which was sitting on my nightstand.

When I picked my phone up, the charging cable slipped off the stand and into the fog.

Speaking of the fog, I’ve been studying it.

There really are people in there, moving slyly behind the shifting patterns. I even saw Avery, floating through the fog with her long hair drifting like seaweed. She opened her mouth, and it was filled with rows of shark teeth.

But her singing–oh!

It’s so lovely it makes me cry.
