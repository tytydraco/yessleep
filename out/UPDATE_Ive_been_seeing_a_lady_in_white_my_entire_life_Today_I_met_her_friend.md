Eliana didn’t move for hours. 

She stayed perched in front of the TV, staring deep into the crackling lines of the channel. The static would change in speed and volume, and sometimes I could swear I heard the static turn to whispers. 

After my initial [entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12f335m/ive_been_seeing_a_lady_in_white_my_entire_life/), I spent a few hours attempting to do some research on Eliana before bed. I watched videos, read articles, and joined a couple of sketchy forums—but no dice. Many things did come close, but there was nothing I could find that matched her being. 

No existing depiction of any creature quite captured how *terrible* I felt every second spent looking in her direction. 

The longer I kept my gaze on her, the more the world unraveled around us. 

It always starts with a dizzying haze. Then, she turns and I get sucked into the ghastly void she hides under her tangled mats of hair. The room both shrinks and grows, joining me in the same breath, and the colors fade from the wall. My palms get sweaty, my heartbeat quickens, and I lose what little hope I have left. My breath catches in my throat as the floor turns to liquid beneath me. 

Dread creeps her fingers up my spine, and Death seems like a friend. 

A voice drowns out the muffled warbling noise growing louder in my head. That voice turns into two, three, and more—and then, they started to scream. 

This, of course, was rectified by *not looking at her at all*, but she could not be ignored. Eliana’s presence was suffocating. 

As I crawled into bed, the weight of her body on the bed sent shivers down my spine. No matter which way I turned, I could feel her empty gaze locked right on me. And when I closed my eyes, the image of her skeletal hands, her flesh tightly stretched over tendons, reaching out for my face, lingered in my mind. The haunting crackle of whispering static lulled me to sleep that night. 

You may ask how I knew I could fall asleep next to her. 

I didn’t. 

A part of me was hoping that I would wake up the next day and realize it was just one big dream. 

It wasn’t. 

Instead, I dreamt I was in the bridal suite once again. The familiar yet faint scent of lilies brought a sense of warmth to me amidst my disorientation. But after catching a whiff of muck, ash, and decay, I turned around. 

I was alone in the room, and it was emptier than ever.  

A vintage record player sat in the corner of the room playing a silent vinyl. The windows were no longer letting in the sunlight but showed an endless ocean of white. There was no color, no shadows, and nothing past the glass. The dying ivies were spiraling toward the frame, reaching for a light they would never find.

The ornate mirror was empty. It showed neither my reflection nor anything else. Cautiously, I took a step closer to it and the room began to shrink. The walls rumbled and started to move closer.

Coming from the horn of the gramophone was the twisted static of the TV. This time, the whispers were clearer and louder. 

*It will be okay. It won’t be okay. It will be okay. It won’t be okay. It will—* 

I looked back in the mirror and saw Eliana, plucking petals from a dead lily. 

The doorknob jiggled, but the lock held strong and no one came in. 

I woke up at dawn. 

Hot beams of light from the rising sun cascaded through the sheer hotel curtains and onto my skin. The steady crackle of static on the TV screen filled the room with noise. 

Eliana was crawling on top of me, flooding my senses awake with her sulfuric stench. A single bony finger reached for my forehead, and her soulless, gaunt face hovered right above mine. 

Once again, her lack of expression created a bottomless pit in my stomach that sucked in everything from within. 

She grabbed my wrist and a shrill series of clicks echoed from her throat. 

*‘The Astronomer. 97. Can he help?’* 

I didn’t know what that meant.

*‘The one who lived in space.’* She cocked her head at me as if I were the one speaking riddles. Then, her body jerked, elbows and knees twisting in the  direction of the door. Every movement she made was disturbing to watch, and I couldn’t turn away. 

*‘Look for the stars.’* She made to leave with that cryptic remark. As if it were the answer to all my questions. 

I took my chance. Not knowing when I would see her again, I stopped her with the one question that was still burning in my mind.

“Are you an angel?” 

As she turned, my heart began to race, and my body felt like it was slowing down. She spider-crawled up next to me in her contorted fashion, and I was paralyzed with fear. A single bony finger reached out, tracing around my jawline and running over the grooves of my face. I could feel a bead of sweat form on the tip of my nose, and I held my breath as Eliana spoke directly inside my head. 

Her voice was piercing, and scratchy, and caused a resounding chill deep in my lungs, making me feel as though my very soul was being invaded. 

‘*Do angels look like me?’* 

She disappeared with that statement. Turned invisible right before my eyes.

My daily alarm went off then, labeled with a reminder of what brought me here in the first place. 

*Work*. 

I spent the rest of the morning caught up in meetings. Only two things caught my attention—the new food truck alert on our app, and a delay in my plans. Due to a booking issue, the office moved my train back to Napa by a few days. My reservation was already being extended.  

Feeling weightless for the first time, I spent the rest of the day enjoying the hotel’s amenities. Though Eliana was nowhere to be seen, I couldn’t let go of what she said. Her words echoed in my thoughts throughout the day and chased me until I slept.  

The next day, I woke up to a chill breeze from the open window, with dreams about angels and astronauts. Deciding to follow up on Eliana’s words, I left my hotel and took an Uber to a location I had found the night before. 

The Astronomer’s Lodge, on 97th Street. 

When I got there, I found a fancy avant-garde restaurant with elevated pub fare. I wasn’t even allowed a seat in the bar for my effort, but they did give me a matchbook. 

I punched in a new search on my phone, and I was reaching for any lead I could get. Main keywords of choice were astronomy, angels, and demons. Rough start, but it was all I had. 

To no one’s surprise, my initial hasty search got me a shady astrologer in an expensive crystal store. My search on the web led me nowhere, and in a new neighborhood, I couldn’t find anything to help me at all. Between the new-age hippies peddling lavender joints and miracle oils and the witchy section of lifestyle stores, it was hard to find a true occult store in the middle of LA. 

Not to mention “the stars.” The only stars here were the rich ones in Hollywood—the lights drowned out what was left of the sky. 

I ended up calling my mother. Of all things. 

I asked if she ever saw a ghost in the house we lived in years ago—all she did was laugh, as she remembered the day I met Eliana clearly in her head. Though, what she recalled was her normally mild-mannered child screaming about ghosts, and how delightfully out of character it was. 

When I asked her about a faceless lady in white, she laughed and said that she’d seen ghosts in her life, but never one without a face. I asked about her ghosts, but she said they weren’t hers to share. I asked about angels, and she asked where hers was before hanging up with a promise to call back soon. 

My leads were cold, and there was no love lost from my usual cryptic mother. With a sigh, I tabled my hunt for the day and stopped to get snacks before turning in. 

That was why I was surprised when the man at the grocery butcher shrieked at the sight of Eliana in the reflection. I raised an eyebrow at this, and when he awkwardly played down his reaction to a concerned customer, I knew he could see her, too. 

She hadn’t shown herself for a few days, and I wondered what drove her to reveal herself in this grocery store. 

The butcher trembled with fear when one of her skeletal hands gripped onto his shoulder, and the chipped nails of the other stroked the side of his tattooed neck. I bit back a laugh—Eliana draped herself like a contorted scarf atop his bright orange vest. 

She tapped on his nametag and tilted her head at me. 

Briefly, I wondered how it was that I had never met anyone that could see Eliana before, yet some butcher named Oscar in a random food market who was the first in years to catch her attention, and to feel my plight. 

When he called for my number, I asked to see the chicken breast and whitefish with a comical wink. 

Horrified, he hurriedly led me through the back and into a cold storage area. It smelled dank, and slightly of ash. I wasn’t one to judge, crudely reminded of my own days in customer service. 

“This can’t be happening,” he uttered, eyes wide with alarm. He moved with urgency, though I couldn’t tell if it was from the fear of seeing Eliana, or something more. 

Beside him, large hunks of beef and pork littered the shelves. Sausages and herbs hung from ceiling hooks, wrapped with parchment and twine. The chill fog of the cooler floated around our heads as he closed the door behind us with a hiss. 

Eliana’s head twisted like a spindle, and she chattered in our direction. Oscar let out a soft yet shrill squeak, but I was much less scared of her than he was. I noticed that he looked in every direction but hers. 

“Did they send you?” Oscar asked in a hushed whisper. His hands were shaking, and I was certain it wasn’t from the cold. He seemed to be in disbelief as he looked me up and down, and I could only imagine why.  

It was the first I’d heard any mention of *them* since the first night, and it was coming from a lunatic. I couldn’t help the twitch of my brow, but he continued regardless. 

“I knew they would come for me,” he stammered. Sweat pooled on his brow, and his eyes darted back and forth, staring right through me. 

“They’ll always find you, no matter where you go.”

The man was speaking in cryptic nonsense, but he was still my only lead. I was waiting for him to tell me more, but he never did. Unfortunately, Eliana took that moment to attack a pork loin beside him, and Oscar screamed and went running for the hills. 

I did the only reasonable thing to do then, and chased him down. 

We ran through the back of the storage area all the way outside. I followed him around the corner and down a couple of blocks when he barreled into the heavy glass doors of a bus station. 

Just inches from the station’s entrance, I felt it again. 

It hit me as soon as I crashed through the doors. Every eye in the station was on me in seconds. The sick stench of decay sat heavy in the air. It was accompanied by growing uneasiness and a sense of dread. 

A familiar kind of dread. 

A dizzying haze that started from the back of your head, and quickly made it to the front. I was walking on solid ground, but it made me feel like I was swimming deep in the open ocean. My hands were getting bigger, and smaller and my heart pounded in anticipation. 

Fighting through the feeling, I looked around for Oscar. The people in the station seemed to get further away as I searched. They all turned to look in my direction, and their voices got louder. They were speaking directly inside me, and I heard my voice shout amongst theirs.

The corners of my vision got blurry, and the lines of the tiles started to wiggle. The walls around me throbbed with life of its own, they started to hum.

I looked for Eliana, hoping she was the source, but she was nowhere to be found. I wanted to scream, yell, and cry but found myself incapable of them all. 

Knees buckling, I reached for the nearest chair only to stumble into a soft wall. I was struggling to catch my breath, when a firm hand gripped the back of my shirt and pulled me up. Biting my tongue in surprise, I cursed and turned my head to address the source of my distress. 

“*Don’t* look up—I clocked you as soon as you got in,” growled a husky voice. “Don’t let it see you, too.” 

Under a velvet hood, his salt-and-pepper hair flowed in waves down to his shoulders. He had a thick, dark beard, split only by a deep scar on his jawline. His mouth seemed to be painted with a scowl, and his nose was wide and slightly askew. 

His most striking feature were his eyes, entirely black and dotted by specks of white. Each dot glowed like a star and seemed to be pointed in a different direction. A deep, dark void obscured his scleras, blocking any light from entering. 

They were like nothing I had ever before seen. 

He carried brilliant night skies in the depths of his head. 

“If you look up, you will die,” he spat. He didn’t turn to face me once, but  just glared straight ahead. “If you look down, you will die. If you die here, you will never truly die. Don’t *fucking* die.” 

I nodded my head fiercely, my heart pounding in my chest. I couldn't believe what was happening—just knew I didn’t want to fucking die.

“In a few moments, you’re going to feel something on your feet, then the rest of your limbs. Don’t freak out; it’ll be over soon. Don’t look too long at the purple shit, and *don’t* let it look in your eyes. It’s gonna get real weird before it ends, kid.” 

My mouth was dry, and I couldn’t respond. I had a thousand questions on my mind, about the purple shit, about the man, about our situation—but it didn’t matter then.

It had started.

Through my socks and my flats, my feet got wet. I flinched in recoil, but could not get away from the disturbing pressure forming around my legs. Something was *licking* them. In between every crevice, around the heels and ankles, a sticky, slimy residue remained. The putrid taste of bile built in the back of my throat as I felt something hot and moist breathing on my limbs. The muffled sounds of wet flesh and bone contorting filled my ears.

I did not look down, nor did I look up. 

Directly in front of me, the bus station came to life. The sky in the windows seemed to get eaten, showing nothing but black through the glass. Blue plastic chairs turned into sharp teeth, and the ground underneath our feet squished with pressure. A pulsating mass of tiled flesh and throbbing veins moved under the floor, opening its gaping maw and absorbing everything atop it.

My heart raced, and my breath caught in my throat. Should I run? Could I save any of them? Should I even try? My limbs were frozen with fear, and the stranger beside me stayed still. 

I could only look ahead, where one by one, I saw the people inside the station fall victim to the creature. Though not a single one was able to witness the horror that consumed them, their faces still twisted in agony as they were devoured. To them, they only felt the touch of something grand, and an unsettling weight gnawing on their souls. 

The mass chose its victims with abandon, each one disappearing in the blink of an eye. Soon, it would have taken them all, and it would look to the ones who were left. 

Time was running out.

An iridescent purple blob of slime remained where each body once was, pulsing with faint remnants of life. Distantly, I wondered what was keeping the being from inhaling and turning us into that goop as well. 

And somewhere deep within me, I craved that ending as well. 

Instead, I was trapped—watching the unfortunate victims fall prey to a predator that was greater than them. In mere seconds, it was their existence that came to an end as the essence of their lives was sucked out by a cosmic straw. In the end, only the stranger and I were privileged enough to bear witness to their tragic ends. 

I could feel the creature's presence looming still, its gnawing hunger palpable in the air. Once it completed feeding, only a handful of us remained. Piles of clothing remained where people once stood. I wondered how this tragedy would possibly get covered up. 

The sopping weight released its clutches from my limbs, and I went to stretch. In the same motion, I looked up, and at the center of it all, it was showing itself to us for the first time. 

A large, grotesque tongue stuck out from the ceiling. 

I accepted my demise then. Though it had teeth, there were no lips. I couldn’t help staring, and I couldn’t turn away. Its bloodshot eyes locked directly on mine. 

And as soon as we made eye contact, the ceiling launched itself from the roof and directly at me. 

I thought I’d see my life flash by. It moved with inhumane speed, and I was frozen—unable to react. 

Miraculously, I was saved by the stranger jumping in front of me, shielding me with his body. He threw his cape off in what I knew had to be a practiced motion, revealing a worn leather jacket and ripped tunic. He had a rustic square contraption strapped to his chest by a twisted net of leather belts attached to the jacket. It had several knobs and dials, one of which he turned as he revealed the device. 

The ceiling stopped in its tracks, only centimeters away from our heads. It was stuck in time, stuck wearing its hungry grin. 

I felt the heat of its rotting breath, and watched heavy globs of purple saliva drip from its teeth. 

“We’re getting out of here,” the stranger stated, staring directly past the being. He seemed to be speaking to both me and the creature. Its irises moved around and tracked our movement with hunger, but it seemed unable to move in pursuit of us. “Don’t turn around, and back out of the door.” 

I did as he said, and we made our way out of the bus station. As the doors closed in front of us, I noticed a bright orange vest amongst a pile of clothes on the floor. 

I watched through the glass entryway as the ceiling leaped from where we left it and slammed itself against the doors. Then, it quickly receded into its position as a normal ceiling in a regular bus station. Then, *people* rose from each pile I could see and started walking around the station. Their movements were jagged and crooked, and their faces were devoid of any emotion.

And then I saw the flash of orange, and saw Oscar once again. He walked among them, a shell of his expressive self before. He noticed me through the glass, and I turned swiftly on my heel before he registered me. I didn’t move quite fast enough, so I didn’t miss how his mouth twisted into a wicked smile. 

And I didn’t miss the skinny tendril of black smoke coming from his head.

That thing was *not* Oscar. And now, I wasn’t sure if *Oscar* ever existed in the first place. 

“Keep moving,” the stranger grunted. 

I turned around and started walking. The bus station was behind us now, and it would be as if nothing ever happened. The sky was normal, and the sun was even setting, causing it to turn a pretty shade of pink. 

Next to me, the starry-eyed stranger lit up a cigarette from his pocket. He offered one, holding out the pack of Reds expectantly. I didn’t normally smoke, but I didn’t think I’d start to digest what just happened if I didn’t. 

I took one with gratitude and remembered the matchbook from earlier in the day. At that moment, I was ready to throw it on the ground. Now, I was glad I kept it near. 

“I’ve got a light,” I said, rummaging in my pockets for said matchbook. I felt the light crinkle of paper, as well as the folded cardstock I was looking for, and pulled them both out. 

I nearly spat out my cig when I saw it. The rumpled order ticket from the butcher that I hadn’t thrown out. 

*97.* 

The stranger next to me huffed, having lit his own, and I couldn’t believe I hadn’t seen it before. In hindsight, his eyes alone should have given it away. A man with literal galaxies in his eyes? *Look for the stars?* 

“Who are you?” I asked. I didn’t even care to strike the match anymore. I knew the answer to my question already. 

A waft of a familiar sulfuric odor entered my nostrils. Faintly, I realized it was growing on me. 

Eliana’s ghastly visage appeared upside down next to the stranger,but instead of terror, he turned to face her with resignation. 

“You again, loud girl?” he sighed. “What have you done now?” 

He stared directly at her face when he talked to her. The lack of anything seemed not to bother him. 

Eliana, who fully appeared sitting on the stranger’s shoulders, grasped his hands with her own. Next to the bulky man dressed like a steampunk engineer, Eliana was small, thin, and frail. 

Her white dress was slightly sheer in the light of the sunset. Minus the abject horror of her body, I thought she looked quite pretty. For once, I wasn’t deathly afraid of her. This was a sign of Eliana that I had never seen before. 

Sure, maybe she wasn’t an angel. Maybe she was a demon. But she was here now, and it didn’t seem like we would be separating any time soon. I resolved to figure out her origins, and my first lead was the hulk of a man she chattered with now. 

“Alright, girl. We’ll meet at the rendezvous in three days. Yes, the one up north. Be safe, and don’t go in between.” 

Eliana chirped once. 

In a single swift motion, she jumped from the stranger to me and grabbed my face tightly in her hands. Looking up at her now, I felt less of the uneasiness that accompanied viewing her. 

*Do not die. He will explain. He has seen the stars.* 

She disappeared again, leaving not a single trace. Hopefully, she was right, and the stranger would finally tell me what was going on. 

“She does that,” the man said, followed by a gruff cough. “I’ll explain on the way up. You got a car?” 

“No, I’m from out of state—are you him? Are you The Astronomer?” I couldn’t keep the questions from escaping now, and I was surprised I had managed to wait this long in the first place. “Will you finally tell me what’s going on?” 

He sighed and pulled another cigarette from his pocket pack. “At least you got one thing right. She really told you jack, huh, kid? Like I said, I’ll tell you on the way. Right now, we’re going to Sacramento.” 

*“Sacramento?!”* 

“Sacramento,” he affirmed, breathing out a plume of smoke. “Now, unless you’ve got a car, we have to figure out a way up there, stat. Them’s gonna be coming, especially after that mess in there.” 

I realized then, that I didn’t have any options. I had been sucked into a journey that started with questions I still didn’t have the answer to. 

And yet, this man seemed to have them. 

I knew what to do then.  

“Like I said, I don’t have a car,” I repeated. “But what about a train?” 

He raised an eyebrow in intrigue. “You don’t know what you just said. Train’s out of the question.” 

“But I already have a ticket booked for Napa for work—and it leaves tomorrow morning.” 

He let out a cloud of smoke right in my face.

“You’re asking for it, kid.” 

—

I should have listened to him about the train. 

To be fair, he didn’t give me much detail, either. 

The starry-eyed stranger—no, The Astronomer—and I, were now waiting to enter Union Station. True to her word, Eliana was nowhere to be seen, which left the two of us standing around, waiting to go inside. 

There was just an overwhelming presence that was stopping us. A foreboding warning, a sign that this was sure to be a hell of a trip. 

I’m sure The Astronomer picked it up, too, but I’m afraid to say it out loud. I think they’d hear me.

But the windows of the station aren’t just windows—they’re eyes, and they’ve been watching us since we got here. 

And we still have an hour until our train.
