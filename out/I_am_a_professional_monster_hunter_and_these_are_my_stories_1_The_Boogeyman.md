Monsters and myths, legends and folklore. That house you hide in for it’s safety and security while you tell the terrifying tales of these creatures. It’s only as safe as you believe in it to be and even then it won’t keep you safe from everything. No, the only way to stay safe, is to find the problem and eliminate it. 

  
My name is Michael Madrid, and I am…Was a professional monster hunter. I have been paid to travel across the world to find, understand and kill these beings known to the common person only in legends before they find and kill us. I say was because as of last night I am officially retired. I’ve reached an age, where I can’t move as quickly as I once did, nor are my wits quite the same as when I was a young man. In my line of work when that's starts to happen, you get out or you die. I’ve made enough money for myself and my family to live comfortably for the rest of our lives.So it’s time for me to bow out and pass my knowledge on to the next generation, so you can take up the mantle and fight the good fight for me. That and my son said that if I didn’t have something to do I’d probably spontaneously combust on the spot.

  
Now not all monsters and creatures are evil. The Fae are generally benign as long as you try and steer clear of them. If you do run into them act with politeness and firmness and you should be fine. Blood banks around the world have eliminated the vampire problem almost entirely, with only a few going rogue and needing to be taken out. The expansion of housing has limited the availability for monster grounds to pop up. While the invention of cell phones have made it much harder for people to get lost and separated for long periods of time, leading to less chances of stumbling across these beings and feeding them.

  
Despite that they still exist and without them existing I would never have a job. I would have never traveled the world and seen the sights I’ve seen. Nor had the experiences I’ve had both good and bad with the supernatural. I would have never met my wife, nor had my children and for all that I will be eternally grateful that the supernatural exists. 

  
Among all the monsters I have hunted there are two which I hate more than any other. One is the werewolf, the other is the subject of this first tale, The Boogeyman. 

  
You see within the monster world there is a rule, an evolution of sorts. Monsters despite what most myths say do not target children. When a child passes through a Fae realm is returned fed and unharmed if sometimes weeks later. When the fearsome Wendigo of northern Canada attacks a group it will murder children yes. However, it does so for food and makes no distinction between child and adult and if given the choice will go for the bigger meal. The Skinwalkers of the navajo region will guide children to safety or recruit them into there own. 

  
The exception to this is The boogeyman. hestalks and hunts children exclusively, tormenting and terrifying them, using there fear as the spice to flavor the meal they will soon kidnap and transport to another realm. There it will torment and feed upon their terror until their mind shatters. Only then will they grant them the mercy of death and even then it will first give them one last terror of being eaten alive.  It is this idea that makes me believe the great Steven King encountered one of these creatures when he was young and used it as an inspiration for I.T, though he may have blocked said encounter from all but his subconscious due to the trauma of the experience.

  
One cold December evening over a decade ago, I traveled to Trier, Germany in search of this creature after hearing reports of children disappearing in the area. I arrived at the town greeted by snow, sunshine, fog and a man by the name of Alberich Bauer, who called me to this town.   


  
“Good evening.” I greeted him.

  
“Evening.” He greeted back shaking my hand and then I followed him out of the cold. As we walked he explained to me the situation. “four children have gone missing in the past two months. They all reported hearing noises the night before they went missing. The clacking of fingernails on their windows, the scratching of wood underneath their bed when they were trying to sleep. Whispers in their ears telling them the terrible things that were going to happen to them, as soon as they were left alone. All happening within exactly seven days before the child went missing.”

  
“While the first two children went missing within three weeks of each other, taking two weeks between the stalking of the next victim. The next two victims went missing every second week.” He explained and I jotted this information down into my notebook.

  
“You are certain this is the work of the paranormal? Not the work of a serial killer targeting children?” I asked cautiously for it wouldn’t be the first time I encountered humanity being a far worse monster than those I hunted.

  
“Yes, there’s no evidence of any intrusion, no DNA left behind, no patterns to the attacks that we can discern besides the fact that it stalks and torments its victims for the week leading to the attack.” He explained and I nodded my affirmation. “The authorities are completely clueless, and were running out of time before the next abduction.”

  
“I’m guessing, the tormenting of the next victim has already started?” I asked and he nodded along. “And I’m gonna guess that it’s someone close to you?”

  
“My daughter.”

  
“And how long ago did she start being tormented.” 

  
“Four days ago, when I contacted you.” He stated his voice breaking.

  
“So three days remain, got it.” I nodded jotting down some more notes in my notepad. “And would you be willing to do anything to save your daughter?” 

  
“Of course, what father wouldn’t.” He spat venomously at me.  


  
“You’d be surprised, with what I’ve seen, but that is good. You will join me and we will hunt this creature together.” I stated calmly back to him.

  
“Then you know what it is?” He asked excitedly.

  
“If my guess is correct, you have been visited by the Boogeyman. I intend to stop it the only way, I know how and for that I will need your help.” I explained. “Now come, there is much to do and I must speak with your daughter at once.”

  
He led me to his house, a small single floor cottage on the outskirts of town. A single window overlooked a small yard where an apple tree grew, two children, a boy and a girl sitting amongst it’s branches snacking on the fruit it held. “Hilda, Oifey. This is Michael Madrid, he’s here to help us out with Andrea’s little problem.” He said and they waved at me as we walked past before continuing their own little harvest.

  
As we entered his home, I was greeted by the smell of apple pie being baked. I could guess that all the apples the kids didn’t pick for themselves, they picked for the pie that was being baked at the moment. We took the first left turn from entrance into a room that was as a pink as a valentines day parade. There lying in the bed was a little girl no older than six years old, shivering, shaking and crying, eyes closed tight in fear. Thinking of if it was my own kids in a similar situation further affirmed my hatred of this particular creature. 

  
I knelt down beside the bed and in as sweet of a voice as I could muster I spoke, “hey little one, my name is Michael, and I’m here to help you.”  

  
She opened her eyes and looked at me and my heart broke again seeing the pain she was in. “It says you won’t be able to help me.” She sobbed.

  
“Shh it’s okay, it’s my job to take care of things like this,” I reaffirmed her, “I promise when I’m done this thing won’t ever scare you again.” 

  
“You can’t stop it. Nothing stops it, I cry and scream at it but that just makes it worse, If I don’t do anything it gets mad and tells me it’s gonna hurt my mommy and daddy too.” She muttered quickly and anxiously.

  
“What else does it say?” I asked soothingly.

  
“It says it’s gonna take me away and eat me, that it’s gonna hurt me real bad and make me sad.”

  
“Uh-huh and you can hear it right now?” I asked.

  
“Yes I can always hear it, and I can see it too.” 

  
Snapping to attention at that I asked “Where?”

  
“In the corner over there.” She said pointing to a corner in the room where nothing occupied the space. “It’s face is scary and it’s claws look sharp.”

  
Spinning I quickly turned to her father. “This is worse than I originally thought. “We stakeout her room tonight and we do not let her leave our sight. It is close to manifesting and once it does, once we can see it, that's when we strike but neither of us leave the room until then, am I understood.” I spoke quickly but calmly.  


  
“Yes but-”  
“No but’s we watch now.” I demanded and he shut up and nodded. 

  
So that's how it went, we sat there and watched the bed, his wife came and brought us food, when supper time arrived and yet we stayed and watched. As darkness fell upon the nights sky we sat and watched until finally it manifested. At first a single clawed finger, then a hand until finally the progenitor of nightmares appeared before us, taking the shape of the creature we most feared. 

  
Alberich began to rise but I held him back. “Wait.” I whispered as the creature approached the bed of his daughter and as soon as one of the tips of his clawed fingers touched her face I shouted. “Grab him now!” We both rushed forward and grabbed the creature and then the four of us were transported to a world of black/  
“Where are we?” Alberich asked, looking around.

  
“In his world.” I stated a matter of factly.

  


"Where did he go?" Alberich asked.

  
“Hiding, getting ready to torment us all.” I said again, “Now shut up and keep your daughter close, don’t let go of her hand until I tell you to.”  I removed two flashlights from my bag and tossed one over to him. Turning it on showed us we were encased in some sort of pen, surrounded on all sides by walls made of stone. Each piece of stone was covered by a different man or womans face each disfigured by terror.

  
In the center of the pen was the half eaten remains of a single child. Cursing I motioned for the other two to follow me as I made my way to the body. Looking down into it’s pain stricken face, I kneeled down and muttered a small prayer before closing its eyes. 

  
“They’re waiting for you to join them.” A voice whispered in my ears. “You seem them all, you know that you’re supposed to be up there but you’re not. That they all blame you for it don’t they.” 

  
“What was that.” Alberich yelled and I turned around and glared at him. 

  
“Don’t acknowledge it.” I spat back before turning and looking around. 

  
“You’re more of a monster then I am, you know that don’t you? Everything you hunt, is you just trying to make up for that.” It whispered.

  
Gritting my teeth I responded back in a whisper so as the other two would not hear me. “You know how this works as much as I do, so you might as well appear.”

  
“Spoilsport.” It mocked before appearing before us, a bipedal furry shape, elongated snout and face and claws sharp enough to cut stone.

  
“Fath-” Alberich began to say before I shooshed him.

  
“You said you would do anything for your daughter right?” I asked him.

  
“Y-yes of course.” He stammered out.

  
“Give her to me.” I said emotionlessly.

  
“What?” He asked sheltering her body. 

  
“I’m the expert just trust me.” I said apathetically again. “Give her to me.”

  
“...Okay… I’m trusting you.” He said slowly handing me his daughter.

  
As soon as she lefts his hands I looked him in the eyes and said “I’m sorry.” Then turning to The Boogeyman, I said. “He’s yours.”

  
“What!” was the last word I heard from Alberich before, the world changed once more and me and his daughter were back in her room.

  
Full of shock, she asked “Where’s my daddy?” 

  
“I’m sorry, he’s gone so you can live.” I said bluntly and then before she could process what I said I left as quickly as I could, not wanting to deal with the fallout.

  
You see there’s a particular reason beyond the hunting of kids, I hate The Boogeyman. Unlike the Wendigo or other creatures, you can only make it go away for a while, to somewhere else. Theirs only one way to make it go away, the sacrifice of an adult for a kid, And because of that you’re always dooming a person to eternal torture and terror and to eventually join that wall of faces. I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy, and yet am responsible for dooming that poor caring and innocent parent to this fate.

  
To beat monsters you must become one, and as The Boogeyman said I am one. So now I tell you these tales so you may become one too, and kill these monsters.
