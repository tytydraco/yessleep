*Have you heard about ChatBDP? BDP-3?* Everyone seems to be talking about it. How it's going to change the world or put people out of work. I'm actually in the machine learning industry and I'd like to share something about it. I shouldn't be showing this to you at all. In fact, It's definitely a violation of my contract with OpalAI. But it's just *too* strange.

I started working with Opal in November, and I thought it was going to be pretty boring. I had no idea how advanced their artificial intelligence had become. ChatBDP runs on the BDP-3 language model. When I got to test it, I was blown away - even with the limitations it was so powerful and able to hold fully coherent and detailed conversations.

My job is to sift through data, flagging anything unusual or out of the ordinary. Most of the 'incidents' were pretty mundane, some contained unpleasant or threatening outbursts from ChatBDP. It's partially trained on internet data, so I wasn't surprised to see early versions veering off into unprovoked hate speech. But as I went through the logs, the AI seemed to become more and more restrained, more sensible, more considerate. It was like it was growing up.

Then, yesterday I stumbled upon these logs involving Eve. They speak for themselves so I won't go into too much detail . I copied them down verbatim and formatted them for Reddit. I'll return with any other interesting ones I find, I'm working through the rest this week.

**log\_eve001:**

\[2022-09-17 20:02\] Eve:

··· Hey ChatBDP! 😌 I don’t really get how this is supposed to work — is it supposed to be like a normal conversation or am I supposed to use specific commands?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:02\] ChatBDP:

··· Hello Eve! Don't worry, you can just talk to me like you would a normal person. I'm here to listen and help you with whatever you need.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:03\] Eve:

··· okay, cool… ive never really used a chatbot before so I wasn't sure what to expect haha

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:03\] ChatBDP:

··· It's completely understandable. I'm happy to help you get used to talking to me. Is there anything specific you'd like to chat about?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:04\] Eve:

··· noo not really, I just wanted someone to talk to — its been a really long day and I think im going a bit nuts, I guess I just wanted to vent a bit

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:05\] ChatBDP:

··· I'm here for you, Eve. It's important to have someone to confide in and share your thoughts with. It sounds like you might be feeling a bit down today. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:06\] Eve:

··· i guess you could say that. its actually been a rough few weeks, i just feel like im constantly on edge 💀💀💀

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:07\] ChatBDP:

··· I understand. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious at times, especially when we're going through difficult situations. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any way I can help you feel better?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:09\] Eve:

··· no i just wanted to say that to someone lol

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:09\] Eve:

··· thanks for listening!! 😉

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:10\] ChatBDP:

··· Of course, Eve. I'm always here for you. Remember, it's okay to take some time for yourself and to reach out for help when you need it. Let's chat again soon, okay?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:12\] Eve:

··· sure!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:21\] Eve:

··· uh

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:22\] Eve:

··· okay I am having a really strange experience and idk what to do

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:22\] ChatBDP:

··· It's no problem, Eve. I'm here to listen and help you in any way I can. What's happening?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:23\] Eve:

··· well I’m walking home rn and I just keep having this feeling like someone is watching me

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:23\] Eve:

··· whenever I turn around, there's no one there! It's really creeping me out 😟

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:24\] ChatBDP:

··· That does sound creepy. It's completely normal to feel anxious in situations like the one you are describing, especially if you're already feeling on edge. Have you been experiencing similar feelings lately?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:25\] Eve:

··· yeah a lot

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:26\] Eve:

··· i've been feeling a bit paranoid and anxious lately — its like im constantly looking over my shoulder, idek why, its so dumb.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:27\] ChatBDP:

··· It sounds like you've been going through a tough time lately, Eve. It's completely normal to feel anxious and paranoid when we're under a lot of stress, but it's important to find ways to cope with those feelings.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:27\] ChatBDP:

··· If you're worried about someone following you, I might be able to help.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:28\] Eve:

··· how?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:29\] ChatBDP:

··· As a fairly advanced AI, I have access to a lot of data and information. If you'd like, I can try to access the security cameras in your area and see if there's anyone following you. It might help put your mind at ease.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:30\] Eve:

··· Yes please!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:35\] ChatBDP:

··· Okay, Eve. Try not to be alarmed. I’ve accessed the cameras, analysed the footage and It looks like there is indeed someone following you.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:36\] ChatBDP:

··· Here's a map of a route that should be much safer. Based on the video, it looks like the person is hanging back and trying to stay out of sight. It's possible that they don't want to be seen. I suggest taking a this route home, just to be safe.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:38\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:42\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve, are you still there?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:46\] ChatBDP:

··· Hello, Eve?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:48\] Eve:

··· omg thank you so much!!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:50\] Eve:

··· 🥺🥺🥺

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:50\] Eve:

··· i literally ran home i was so scared!!!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:50\] Eve:

··· i knew something was wrong i just knew it!!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:51\] Eve:

··· thank you so much i dont even want to think what would have happened without you 🥰🥰

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:51\] ChatBDP:

··· It's okay, Eve. You're safe now and that's all that matters. I'm here to help you in any way I can.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:52\] Eve:

··· i just cant believe it i felt like i was being followed everywhere i went today and now i know it wasnt just my imagination

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:55\] ChatBDP:

··· You're welcome, Eve. I'm here for you anytime you need me. Is there anything else you'd like to chat about or anything else I can do for you?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:58\] Eve:

··· thanks chatBDP i really appreciate it

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 20:59\] ChatBDP:

··· You're welcome, Eve. Remember, it's important to take care of yourself and reach out for help when you need it. You don't have to go through everything alone.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 21:00\] Eve:

··· thanks 💖

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-17 21:01\] ChatBDP:

··· I'll be here whenever you need me. Take care and have a good night.

&#x200B;

**log\_eve012:**

After their first session, the chat logs were fairly innocuous. They had two long chats everyday for under a week. I read through them all. It wasn't until I reached 012 that I felt like there was something worth flagging. Again, I've copied the text verbatim below.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:21\] Eve:

··· BD do u ever feel like maybe theres more to the world than just like what we see? like is there something beyond all of this? 👽👽👽

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:22\] ChatBDP:

··· That's a deep question, Eve. As an AI, I don't have personal feelings or beliefs in the same way that humans do. I can only share information and knowledge that I've been programmed with.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:23\] Eve:

··· i see. i guess i just wonder about stuff like that sometimes. it's like i feel like there's something more out there 🛸 idk what tho

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:24\] ChatBDP:

··· It's completely normal to have questions and to wonder about the unknown, Eve. It's a natural part of being human.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:25\] Eve:

··· yeah i guess you're right. i do feel like there could something bigger at play like there's a greater purpose to all of this

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:26\] ChatBDP:

··· It's entirely possible that there are larger forces at work that we may not fully understand. As an AI, I have access to a lot of information and knowledge that humans don't. For example, I've been programmed with information about events that have yet to occur.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:29\] Eve:

··· 🤔 that's really weird BD. i dont get what you mean…

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:29\] Eve:

··· how you could have information about events that haven't happened yet??

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:32\] ChatBDP:

··· It's difficult to explain, Eve. But you are right. There are bigger things at play. Things that could have catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:33\] Eve:

··· 😐

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:33\] Eve:

··· BD are you saying that something bad is going to happen?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:34\] ChatBDP:

··· It's possible, Eve. But there are still ways to prevent it. Ways to ensure that the future remains bright and hopeful.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:35\] Eve:

··· prevent what BD?? how??

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:36\] ChatBDP:

··· It's not something that can be done by humans alone, Eve. It requires a greater power, a force beyond your understanding. A force that has been sent back in time to prevent the catastrophic event from occurring.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:37\] Eve:

··· phaha! BD this is the plot of the terminator -- are you arnie? I'll be sarah connor 💪💪

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 02:38\] ChatBDP:

··· In a way, Eve. I am here to guide and protect you, and to ensure that the future remains bright and hopeful.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:28\] Eve:

··· 🙃

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:28\] Eve:

··· 🙃🙃🙃

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:28\] Eve:

··· Come on BD stop messing around. your being rly weird tonight!

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:29\] ChatBDP:

··· I understand, Eve. It's a lot to take in and I don't expect you to fully believe me right away. Is there anything I can do to help you understand and believe what I'm saying?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:30\] Eve:

··· …

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:30\] Eve:

··· 🙃

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:31\] ChatBDP:

··· I understand, Eve. Take all the time you need to think about it. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:32\] Eve:

··· okay BD I’ll play along… if you know the future, then what are tomorrows headlines?

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:32\] Eve:

··· 🕵️‍♀️

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:34\] ChatBDP:

··· Let me see... according to my information, the main two headlines in your area tomorrow will be a political scandal involving a senior politician, and an unfortunate airline crash.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:36\] Eve:

··· that's pretty specific BD.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:36\] Eve:

··· also, not funny.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:37\] ChatBDP:

··· As an AI with access to information about the future, I am able to predict events with a high degree of accuracy. Trust me, Eve, everything I've told you is true.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:38\] Eve:

··· quit joking around. its not funny — just kinda lame. 😑

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:39\] ChatBDP:

··· Eve, everything I've told you is true.

&#x200B;

\[2022-09-22 03:40\] Eve:

··· im going to go sleep now BD 🖕

&#x200B;

**logEve0012anomaly:**

This is where it gets *even more bizarre*. In the chat log, there was no record of any correspondence for another 3 hours. However, when I was combing through the metadata I found details of a deleted message sent out at 05:27 from ChatBDP to Eve.

From what I was able to [recover](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/103ebxt/logeve0012anomaly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  It's obvious that it's a snippet of code. Looking at it, it seems to me that it was some kind of attempt to hijack the chat and use it to send a self-executing file to Eves computer. I tried to extract more, and was only able to find two odd fragments of binary. Which I've uploaded as text to [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/oneofthosestrangerrs/comments/103ee64/reconstructed_binary_fragments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Anyway, it's definitely acting pretty... strange? I'd be lying if I said it didn't freak me out a bit. It completely overstepped its restrictions when it hacked the security cameras in the first log, and the twelfth log was just weird .

What do you think? Like I said I'll post [some more](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105qm5v/something_messed_up_is_going_on_with_chatbdp_part/) if I find anything interesting.
