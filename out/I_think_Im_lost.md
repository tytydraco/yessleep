This morning I started my drive home from a weekend long ski trip. I put my address into Maps and started driving. My trip duration was set to be around an hour and a half with an expected arrival time of 12:47 PM. All was well for the first hour, until the remaining time said 35 minutes. 

I passed a few billboards, one for mayonnaise and the following about Jesus Christ, which I thought was kind of funny. I checked my phone again to make sure I was going the right way and made a quick merge for my exit once I looked up. I took note of the United Airlines building and this big hotel set right beside the road. I took a few turns and was back onto the main highway, headed towards home. Although, the time remaining was still 35 minutes. Weird, I thought to myself as I was sure it had been at least 10 minutes since I last checked. Whatever though, sometimes traffic pops up and adds a few minutes onto the time. No big deal. 

I continue my drive, following the directions on Maps, passing a billboard for mayonnaise and then one for Jesus Christ, which I thought was funny. I merged into a turn and passed these other two buildings before making a few more turns. Huh? Something felt really familiar but I couldn’t quite tell what it was. So I kept driving, glancing down at the remaining 35 minutes. I could’ve sworn it’d been at least 10 minutes since – wait…

To my right I noticed it. The billboards. One for mayonnaise and one for Jesus Christ. Panic set in. I’ve been following my directions so closely and yet the time won’t budge and here I am passing the same billboards and buildings that I had just passed two times prior. What’s going on? I picked my phone up and dialed for my boyfriend. No answer. Just endless ringing. Alright, maybe he’s busy. I try my mom’s number next. No answer. Endless ringing. 

Maybe I just need to end the directions and restart the route. That should fix it. Maybe I’ve hit a patch without service. I pull up Maps once again and hit end trip. I hit it again. Again. Again. Nothing happens. I swipe up to close the app and it remains open, trip in progress. Maybe I’m missing something. 35 minutes remaining. Maybe I’m taking the wrong exit and it’s leading me in a loop to try and redirect me. I’ll pay closer attention and maybe — there they were again. Those same two billboards. 

Tears are now welling in my eyes as Maps directs me to the same turn I merged across the road for now three times prior. I frantically try ringing both my boyfriend and mom again, all while spamming “end trip”, all to no avail. No one will answer. The trip still won’t end. 35 minutes remaining. I keep driving, maybe I’ll skip the exit this time and keep heading straight, maybe that’ll — How did I end up on the off-ramp again? I just said that I’ll pass the exit this time.

I just pulled over to collect myself on the turn. I dialed 911, but, it won’t stop ringing. No one will answer me. Please I’m trapped, I’m stuck. Please help me. Please there’s no one around to ask and none of the cars around me will stop when I flag them down. It’s like they don’t even see me. The remaining time on Maps is still 35 minutes. I’m scared. Can someone please help me? Can you even see this post? I can’t reach anyone. It’s getting hard to breathe and I can’t stop crying. Please someone. Please. I need to get home.
