You don’t have to believe me, but I know what I saw.

It was just a regular day in October. Leave had fallen from some trees, while the rest had remained a gold-ish red color. The temperature dropping, and the days getting progressively shorter. The forest behind my house, rich with animals, going about their business. On this particular day, I had invited some friends over to study for an upcoming test. I invited about 4 or 5 people, at around 6 in the afternoon, and we planned on studying, playing video games, and watching TV. My parents were away on a well needed vacation, and my sister was away at a friend’s house for the night. 
The first time something remotely weird happened, was around 5:30. I was cooking some food, and I had been watching some youtube on my phone for background noise, when I felt something watching me. I looked towards the forest, and I saw it. It was a large, pale figure, that looked to be about 7 or 8 feet tall. It was on all fours, and red eyes. It had a broad grin, and I saw razor sharp teeth. It looked like it hadn’t eaten in a while, and the moment I saw it, it darted back to the woods. I was pretty spooked, to say the least, but I had to defend myself in case this thing tried to attack me. So, I grabbed my dad’s gun, and kept it in me. I resumed cooking, and had continued listening to a video about video games.

The second time something weird happened, was when everybody but my girlfriend left. We were cuddling on my couch, when I heard a scream. At the same time, Me, my girlfriend, and my dog all looked at the direction of the scream. It came from the forest in the backyard. I turned on my backyard lights to try and get a better view, when I saw it again. The same pale, and starved thing. Only this time, it had blood coming from its mouth. My girlfriend let out a yelp, and my dog started barking, but the thing just stood there. I had to do something. I opened the door, walked to my backyard, and pulled out my dad’s gun. I shot the sky 1 or 2 times to scare it off, but it just stood, unfazed. I then pointed the gun at the thing, and it retreated to the forest.
 
Obviously terrified, my girlfriend asked if we could go up to my room. I said sure, and then decided to watch TV in my room. My girlfriend was playing with my dog on my bed, when out the corner of my eye, I saw the thing looking into my room. My first thought was “how the fuck did this thing get onto my roof?” My girlfriend noticed me looking at the window, and she saw the thing too. Once again, I grabbed my dad’s gun, and trotted to the backyard, looked up at it on my roof, and shot at it. I got it in the arm, and the leg. It yelped, and jumped from the roof, and dashed back into the forest. That was the last time I saw it, but every time I look to the forest, I feel like something is watching me.
