Eating. Such a natural thing. I love eating, it is no secret, my waistline will tell you that. I just can’t stop myself, it started from a young age. Anything I could get my hands on I would eat. It got to the point where my mother would hide food, put locks on the fridge, the freezer and all the cupboards. That really pissed me off. Stupid bitch did she not understand how badly I needed it. As a sign of rebellion and a way to satiate my undying hunger I found my own food. I started experimenting with bugs, a fly here, a worm there. The subtle pop as you bite into their little bodies and the small satisfying spray of their blood I found so strangely satisfying. More. I had to have more. It just wasn’t enough for me anymore, I needed something bigger.

So I started my quest for a more hearty meal by walking round the village looking for my next snack. As I turned down one of the back roads I found a small muntjac sprawled out in the middle of the road, it had clearly just been struck by a fast moving vehicle. I wandered up to it barely being able to contain my excitement. The sight was gloriously grotesque, bits of mangled flesh flaying off its lifeless body, broken bones snapped in two. My belly began rumbling. I knew I should have taken it home, maybe cooked it. But I just couldn’t wait. I leant down and licked up some of its blood seeping out of its wound. The copper taste hitting the back of my throat as I slurped down a helping of its rapidly cooling liquid. 

I had to stop teasing myself, skip the main course and straight to dessert. I started cutting and carving away little chunks of its flesh. It was so tender, probably thanks to the tyres that decimated the small animal. I then started on the organs, a liver here and a lung there. And then the magnum opus, the heart, the grand crescendo of the body. I bit into the succulent organ and blood began coating the inside of my mouth. It was phenomenal. Almost arousing if you will. I had to have more, better, BIGGER.

I rushed home feeling incredibly accomplished, a grin on my face that can only be described as pure glee. I made it to my front door and quietly creeped in. I couldn’t have my mother seeing me like this, covered in deer blood she would have my sectioned. She mustn't see, she will make me see the bad man. There is nothing wrong me I’m just so fucking hungry.

That night I laid in bed and my stomach began growling again, its feeding time once more. It became unbearable, agony. I. NEED. TO. EAT. No point in telling my mother how hungry I was. She doesn’t care. Says I'm already fat enough that I have already eaten enough! That I'm greedy and pathetic. Why doesn’t she understand I need it, why doesn’t she see how much my hunger drives me fucking crazy. Stupid whore always stops me from getting what I crave most. I’ll show her just fucking hungry I am! 

I went down to the kitchen and found the perfect tool for meat prep. A meat cleaver, I started running my finger up the blade, it made my pants tighter as I began getting turned on at all the depraved and glorious schemes I could unleash with this magnificent stainless steel. The walk down the hallway felt like it would last a lifetime, I couldn’t tell if it was anticipation, nerves or second guessing. 

I slowly opened the door making sure to minimize the creaks. I snuck over to the side of her bed and looked at her. Blissfully sleeping peacefully while her only son is suffering. So selfish. So hateful. My rage boiled up and combined with my insatiable hunger. I brought the cleaver down on her throat. To my surprise the blade didn't just glide through. I thought it would be like a warm knife through butter but it was more like a dull hatchet through a log. She started grabbing the blade trying to remove it. She tried to scream but all that arose was a gurgling sound as her throat was filling with blood. She was choking, coughing up a thin mist of blood. 

She needed to be put down. Put the animal out of its misery, don't let it suffer, I told myself. I brought the cleaver up once again. I unleashed another vicious assault. The silly animal tried blocking my strike with its hands. Of course this defense was futile as my cleaver glided through her hand severing it in two. How foolish. I then began an unstoppable onslaught, cutting and chopping away at my meal until she became nothing more than 150 pounds of delicious carcass. That ear grating fucking gurgling noise eventually ceased. Finally, I can start the main course! I tried the savor the moment but the hunger just took over, I couldn't help it. I became like a rabid animal devouring the corpse. Fuck the cleaver, I started using my bare hands tearing off bit of flesh and cramming them into my scarlet red covered mouth. I can’t stop. I WON’T STOP. NOT. TILL. I’M. DONE. 

Finally… I’m full.
