I work the night shift at Varnum Manufacturing, a place where the machines never sleep and neither do the shadows. It’s the kind of factory where every clang and hiss feels like it has a life of its own, and the fluorescent lights hum with a subtle malice that creeps under your skin after enough hours. My shift ends at 11:45 p.m., but I never leave exactly on time. There’s always something in the rhythm of the factory that makes you hesitate, like the place doesn’t want you to go.

At the end of every shift, we clock out at the same machine. HR installed it two years ago, promising “streamlined attendance tracking.” What they didn’t mention, and nobody really asked, is that the clock takes a photo of you the moment your hand hits the sensor. A small, digital snapshot, stored in a server somewhere. We were told it’s just for payroll verification, for “security purposes.” The first few months, it was funny, people joked about taking selfies with the clock, laughing at their frozen, awkward expressions.

Then Martin disappeared.

He was a quiet guy, worked the line in section C. Nobody noticed at first. One night, he didn’t clock out. Then the next day, the line supervisor said Martin hadn’t shown up. HR checked the clock records. That’s when they found it.

The photograph.

It was Martin, smiling at the camera like always. But behind him…there was someone else. Not someone familiar. Someone standing perfectly still, just behind him, grinning. A face that was almost human but wrong. Too wide, with teeth that reflected the fluorescent light in a way that shouldn’t have been possible.

HR called it a “technical anomaly” at first, tried to cover it. But when they reviewed the last five photos of Martin, the figure was there every night, creeping closer in each shot. By the last image, it was almost over his shoulder, impossibly close. And then Martin was gone. Just…gone.

I didn’t see the figure myself until two nights ago.

I was punching out like normal, tired and wishing the shift would end sooner. My hand hit the clock, and the flash went off. The photo pops up on the small screen: me, smiling like an idiot, hair half-mussed from my helmet. Then I noticed it. Behind me.

A figure. Pale, lanky, and smiling. Standing maybe a foot behind me. Its eyes were blacker than the night outside the factory windows. I stumbled back. My heart felt like it wanted to escape my chest. But when I turned, no one was there. Just the empty, humming hall.

I thought I was imagining it.

Yesterday, HR called me into their office. I’d never been called in just to discuss a photo.

“Your clock-out photo…we need you to come back and retake it,” the HR manager said. Her tone was overly calm, like she was delivering some mundane request, but her hands were trembling slightly.

“Why?” I asked. My voice probably shook.

She hesitated, then said, “There…appearances…anomalies. We can’t explain them. But we need a clean record.”

A clean record. Like the others. Like Martin’s.

I left the office with a cold knot in my stomach. I knew the truth. HR didn’t want a clean photo, they wanted to make sure the figure didn’t appear again.

Tonight, I didn’t go home. I went back to the factory. It was after midnight. The place smelled of oil, metal, and something else…something faint, like burnt hair. I walked the line alone, trying to convince myself it was my imagination. The machines groaned like they were alive, shifting slightly as I passed.

I reached the clock. I stared at it for a long moment, almost daring whatever was behind me to show itself.

I clocked out. The flash went off.

On the small screen, my reflection appeared. And there it was, again.

The figure. Closer this time. Its smile…broader. Its eyes…hungry.

And this time, it raised a hand. Not slowly, but deliberately, as if waving at the camera.

I ran. The echo of my boots bounced off the concrete walls. My phone flashlight did nothing to pierce the shadows. Every hallway looked the same, twisted, like the factory had changed while I wasn’t looking. I tried to tell myself I would leave, get outside, call someone, anything. But the exit…was gone.

Not gone in a structural sense. Gone in a way that felt impossible. Like the factory had rearranged itself. The doors were there, the windows, the loading docks…everything in place, but wrong. I started hearing the machines humming differently, singing almost. A low, guttural sound that seemed to whisper my name.

I found a security camera feed on one of the monitors. The grainy black-and-white image showed the factory floor. And there it was. The figure. Following me. But it wasn’t moving normally. It glided, or maybe the cameras were wrong. Its head twisted at impossible angles to track me.

And then I saw something else. On the monitors, past the figure, were…other people. Hundreds of them. Staring up from the floors, their faces pressed against the metal, their mouths open in silent screams. Some of them were my coworkers. Some…were Martin.

And then the realization hit me like a punch to the gut:

It doesn’t just take your photo. It keeps you.

I bolted for the emergency exit, and this time, the door opened. I ran into the cold night air, collapsing on the asphalt. My lungs burned. I looked back. The factory was dark, quiet, normal. Nothing moved. No lights, no shadows, no machines. But in the corner of my vision…just for a fraction of a second…

A hand waved from inside the dark windows.

I didn’t go home. I didn’t sleep. I’ve been trying to find someone to believe me. I tried calling HR, but the number went to a recording saying the company had been “temporarily relocated for inventory audit.”

I opened my email, hoping to find some explanation, some way to reason this nightmare away. There was a single attachment. A photo. My clock-out image from earlier that night.

And behind me…standing right behind me…was myself.

Smiling.

And waving.

I deleted the email. I deleted the photo. I’ll never clock out again.

But I know I’ll have to.

Because they don’t let you go.

And tonight…HR called.

They want me to retake my [photo](https://www.reddit.com/user/salty_Astronaut77/).
