The night it started I had a dream. My friend Zeke woke up in the night to pee. He tiptoed out of his room into the hallway, when he heard a thud coming from the bathroom. Then I woke up, at the time thinking nothing of it.

I began that day like any other, waking up rushing to play Xbox with my friends. It was Summer which meant time for a sleepover

Russel's parents agreed as they always did. We were ecstatic. 

We headed upstairs to the media room, and dumped out our backpacks full of junk. Russel had an idea to have an "auction" where everyone gathered miscellaneous things pulled from drawers they didn't have much use for and tried to auction it off one by one. The most popular items were my handful of matchbooks and Pok√©mon cards, James's paper ninja stars and Zeke's chicken flavor ramen noodles. Zeke managed to embarrass himself as always asking if Russel's sister Tabitha wanted to join the auction. He had a crush on her and could not hide it to save his life.

As we winded down, Zeke had an idea. 

"Guys, let's sneak out and go ride our bikes around." he said with a whisper. 

"Dude, it's like 2 in the morning, we're gonna get in trouble!" I said, trying not to wake Russel's parents. 

"Yeah, Malik's right my bikes in the garage, there's no way we won't wake my parents." said Russel. 

"Fine." Zeke said.

 "Hey, how about tomorrow, we camp out in your backyard and bring our bikes back there, and at night all we have to do is go through the gate for a late night ride." said James grinning at Russel. 

"Dude, you're a genius." Russel said. 

We stayed up for hours, rotating between playing Mario Kart, watching movies and trying to see who could fart the longest. 

Russel's parents woke us all up around 11 am for pancakes. After that, we headed outside to play 2 on 2 basketball. Rosalie, Ashley, and Levi joined us at around 1 pm. Russel and I would shoot each other disapproving glances whenever Rosalie and Levi would wander off by themselves. The heat of the sun beat down on the gang. 

We decided it was time for a water war. When the last of the water balloon remnants were picked up, at the request of several parents, most everyone headed inside for dinner. All were prepared to ask the inevitable question. Everyone was able to convince their parents, with the exception of Zeke. 

"Yeah, you guys know I can't hang out on Sunday." he said. 

"But you can leave early in the morning." Russel said. 

"Nah, padre won't allow it." said Zeke. 

"You should at least sneak out with us tonight when we ride our bikes, it was your idea after all." I said. Zeke shrugged. 

"This sucks." said James.

Late that night, we sat in the tent, the shadows of our bikes looming outside. 

"My parents are probably asleep by now, wanna go?" asked Russel. 

"Let's go." Zeke and James said in unison. 

We quietly wheeled our bikes to the gate and opened it slowly. Tearing through the yard and down the driveway, we took off. We zipped through the neighborhood trying to outdo each other, the moon glowing above us. Somehow someway we were drawn to the lake. I wish I could have stopped it.

"Man, if Zeke was here, he'd beat us all with that mountain bike." I said. 

We reached Blue Lake. The moons glow reflected off the gently rippling water as we rode around the trail. It was silent with the exception of our bike wheels spinning. The silence was broken up by a sudden splash. 

The boys hit the brakes, panicking as we had no clue what caused this noise. Gazing into the water, we spotted something white and moving. Upon closer inspection it was a goose. Relieved, we laughed it off and continued our trek.

We return to our tent and try to get some sleep. This proves difficult because of the excessive amounts of mosquitoes. That morning, we go about our day, doing our usual outdoor activities such as four square. 

We knew not to even ask Zeke if he could come outside today. He wouldn't answer the door, much less the phone. The hours rolled by as they always did and the sound of parents beckoning us inside for dinner separated us for the night. 

Monday rolled around and I knocked on James door, he soon joined me outside. We walked up the street to Zeke's house and rang the doorbell. No answer. We tried a few more times, still no answer. 

"Maybe they're not home." said James. 

"Ok, let's go get Russel." I said. 

As we walked to Russel's door, I pulled my phone out from my gym shorts and texted Zeke. 

"Dude, you wanna come outside?" I said. We sat on the green box and pondered what we'd do today. 

"Remember when Will peed here? I think you're sitting on the same spot actually." James said to me while laughing. I quickly stood up. A few hours passed and Malik began to grow worried. 

"Dude, Zeke didn't text me back at all." I said.

"Try the group chat." he said. We stood and talked for half an hour waiting, and still no reply. 

"Let's try his house again." said James. We waltzed up to his door and rang the doorbell once again. And again. Still no answer. 

"He didn't say they were going out of town or anything did he?" I said. 

"Nah dude, he would've told us." Russel said. I stop.

"Dude, you hear that?" I ask.

"What?" Russel asks. 

"Listen, the phone." I say. We all fall silent. Russel's home phone rings inside. "No one picked it up, they're not home." I say. 

"Let's check the back door." James says. "Dude, are you crazy, we can't do that!" I shout. 

"Nah, come on, it's 2 to 1, let's check it out." says Russel. 

We pop open the gate, and make our way through the backyard. Chocolate, Russel's family dog runs towards us excited. 

"Look, he doesn't have any food or water left in his bowl." Russel points out. 

"Somethings wrong, they wouldn't do that." says James. 

"I don't know, remember that time they left Chocolate in the backyard during that tornado?" I say. 

"I must have missed that." said Russel. We peer in through the window, the blinds are halfway open. "Lights are off." says Russel. James jiggles the doorknob and the door is locked. 

"I don't know what to do." I say. 

"Let's just go, I'm sure everything's fine, they must've gone out somewhere." said James.

That night as I lie in bed, I have a strange urge. A strong desire to go to the lake.

Russel texts the group chat. "You guys wanna go down to the lake?" 

"Yeah I kinda want to." I say. 

"Yeah" James says. 

No response from Zeke. 

After careful sneaking around, we meet up at the end of the cove. 

"Let's go." Russel says. 

The night is cooler this time around, making the humidity much more bearable. The scent of honeysuckle filled the air as we rode towards the Blue Lake. Once we hit the trail, we spotted something. 

"Woah, what's that." James says stunned. First our eyes are fixed upon something big sinking in the middle of the lake. And then on a fire on the shore. We push our bikes to the absolute limit to make it closer. 

"It's a car!" I shout. The water bubbles up as it sinks to the bottom. Getting closer, we discover the source of the fire, a car door engulfed in flames. 

"Dude, that's Zeke's dad's car!" exclaims Russel.

We rush home, not bothering to be quiet anymore. 

"Mom! Dad!" I yell busting through the door, throwing my bike to the floor. Frantic, I try to explain the situation to my parents. "Zeke, he's missing, his whole family is!" I say breaking down into tears. A lump forms in my throat and I'm barely able to speak. My mom gives me a hug and rubs my back. 

"I know it's hard to lose a friend but sometimes people go away, it will be okay sweetie." My mom says. 

"What?!" I scream in a fit of sadness and confusion. "No, mom, everything is not okay, my friend and his family are missing and their car is in the lake!" I scream, my voice quaking. 

"Why don't you get some rest honey?" my mom says with a concerned motherly look. I storm upstairs to my room and slam the door locking it behind me. Catapulting onto my bed I start dry heaving. 

Frantic, I reached for my phone, seeing a few texts from James and Russel. 

"I think my parents are crazy, they're acting like nothings wrong!" says Russel. 

"Same here" says James.

The next day, we meet up outside at our usual spot. We all have bags under our eyes and messy hair. 

"What are we gonna do?" I ask. "Let's go to his house again." I say. We walk the familiar path up the cove and try ringing the doorbell once again. Once again, no one answers. 

"Let's look up how to pick a lock on Youtube." says James. Some clouds begin to cover up the blistering afternoon sun. We gather materials and get to work, deciding to choose the back door. "We need weapons, just in case." says James. We decide to duct tape our pocket knives to our airsoft pistols, as well as carry a few firecrackers with us. Once inside, it's clear no one's around. 

We step through the familiar house, now darkened and silent. Only, something's off. It's empty, completely empty. There's no furniture or anything. 

"What the..." says Russel. We make our way searching through each room, every one being just as empty as the last. Until we get to the hallway bathroom.

The floor is soaked, and the water looks dirty. Green algae coats the otherwise empty bathroom floor. 

"We gotta go back to the lake." says James. We dart through the house, and run out of the back door. Hopping onto our bikes, we speed towards the lake. The sun begins to peek back out of the clouds. We're drenched in sweat from the ride. Upon arriving we make our way around the trail. 

"What are we looking for?" James says. He stops in his tracks, as do I. Lying on the path before us is a body. It's pale, almost white in appearance. 

"Is that..." James starts to say before he begins to gag. I stare, my face drained of color and drenched in sweat. 

"Who is that?" Russel asks, his teeth chattering in the middle of Summer. The body appears to be that of an older man around 50 years old, with long black hair. His features were strikingly Native American. We never found out who it was, and the next day, the body was gone. Not like anyone would believe us anyhow.

A few months passed with no weird occurrences, for once everything seemed to be back to the way it was. Deep down we knew for whatever reason our parents and seemingly no other adults would believe us, not even the police.

My friends Rosalie, Ashley, and Levi even started to come outside again. One day, the gang decided to have a picnic at the park. We brought an assortment of unhealthy foods. Peanut butter jelly sandwiches, Takis, Hot cheetos, and Honey Buns. As we sat around and joked, something started coming closer. A lone goose made its way towards us. 

"He must be trying to take our food." said James. 

"I'll fight him off." I joked. As it grew nearer, we noticed something about it was not quite right. Protruding from its eye sockets and beak were handfuls of wriggling white worms. The goose hissed an awful noise at us. Worry grew over our faces. 

The creature darted towards Russel. He swung at it, but it was able to bite him several times. He screamed and kicked the goose away from him, white worms wriggled all over his clothes. Everyone else took off running leaving everything behind. While running I noticed another oddity, gray leaves floating in the water. I'd never seen this color on a leaf before, it was an ashy color like burnt leaves. I was stunned and frightened.

That very night, Russel and his family disappeared too. It was exactly like Zeke's dissapearance. Russel's whole house was vacant, except for his room which had a pile of white worms writhing on the floor. I felt helpless. My parents have never acted this strange before. They acted as if this was a normal occurrence. I felt so horrified but yet I still desired to return to the lake.

The remaining group of friends set off for the lake again. We had to figure out what happened to Zeke and Russel. Once again we rode our bikes towards our destination. We were silent on the way there. A serene mixture of fear and acceptance loomed upon our faces. The urges grew stronger. I couldn't fight it. 

We ditched our bikes in the grass, and solemnly walked towards the water as if under a spell. It's all a blur now, stepping into the water. I don't even remember holding my breath, just sinking. Paralyzed by fear. I wish I hadn't stepped into the water. This lake took all my friends, but I could not stop myself from going under. 

The water was impossibly deep and blue, like the mariana's trench. It wasn't murky at all and I didn't even see any fish. I usually have a hard time seeing underwater but not this time. No water pressure either. As we sunk to the bottom, debris started to gather around us. Old broken VHS tapes, dirty stuffed animals, worn out dress shoes and other assorted junk all floating by. 

Then suddenly a blue light appeared at the bottom. I could tell it was the end. A possible opening. I could hear noises from the other end. The screeching of tires, rustling of keys, footsteps and thuds on metal, along with muddled voices. 

I watched on as my friends sunk towards the bottom, vanishing in its light, one by one. Even though I was underwater I shivered and sweated and could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I was completely helpless. I shut my eyes and when I came to, I found myself back on the shore, completely dry. 

In a daze I walked my bike back up to my street. It now resembled a ghost town, so many vacant houses, so many missing friends. 

Eventually over the years, more families filled the houses. Some kids I even got along with, but it did not felt the same. I never let myself get too close, because I knew someday, they would return to the lake.
