Last night, a strange man came to my door, claiming I am living in his house. I was in bed for the night, when his screaming woke me. I was surprised that my dog - one that becomes alert at the slightest noise - wasn’t barking up a storm. I walked down the hall, to the door, listening to his nonsensical screaming asking why the deadbolt was locked and how I got inside his house.


I took the rational approach and explained to him calmly that he was at the wrong house. I'm guessing he was drunk. But he insisted, growing angrier and angrier, banging on the door, hurling insults and threats. He tried everything: He threatened that he'd hurt me;  tried pleading with me - I didnt fall for that! He tried negotiating with me, until he settled on letting the cops sort this out. Fair enough.


While we waited, he tried to trick me into believing him. How and why would he have a key to the door if only the deadbolt kept him out? He described the interior of the house, asking how he would know that. I assumed he may have been a previous owner of the house, though I did find it strange that he knew how my decorations had been arranged.


Once the cops arrived, I expressed my displeasure of this disturbance, so late at night. I was surprised to hear them say it was 8pm; I must have gone to bed early. The policeman, after seeing we both had keys to the house, simply asked for the deed of the house: the ultimate proof of ownership, huh? The man claimed his was in a safety deposit box at our local bank; I didn't even know safety deposite boxes still existed! I knew he was lying and went to retrieve the deed where I keep it safe: Folded in a cigar box in my closet. But when I went to retrieve it, I couldn't find it! This really set me off. I was furious! I told the police that his man had clearly been in my house while I went to work (he had my key, for crying out loud!) and I wanted charges filed for breaking and entering. The strange man seemed unphased, which only served to irritate me even more.


While the cops wrote up their report, the man pulled out his drivers liscence and told the cops something in a calm and cool tone: If the cops looked in the cabinet by the couch, the third drawer on the left side, they'd find multiple bills under his name. I actually laughed at this; that cabinet is empty and has never been used! But when the cop came back, he had various bills and something else in his hand: A picture frame with an old wedding photo on it.


"Sir, if you claim this is your house, why do you have a wedding photo of this man on your cabinet?"


It was extremely difficult to maintain my cool, but I mustered the strength to do it.


"Sir, like I said earlier, this man clearly broke into my house and planted things for this very occasion. Clearly, you see that, no?”


The cop's tone and gaze became soft, almost as if he were talking to a child. Nothing irks me more than when someone thinks I don't know they're talking down to me! People think I cant notice, but I do.


He asked me to come down to the station while they sorted this whole fiasco out, but I said I wouldn't leave my dog behind. I couldn't contain myself anymore, I began to cry in frustration when I realized that man must have taken my dog too! When the cop asked why there was no dog food, bowls, leashes, or anything for a dog in the house, I broke down. As I got in the squad car, I swear the strange man smirked at me, laughing at how badly I had fallen in this trap! 


I can't believe this is happening to me. I feel like I am being set up. Someone has been in my house and has planted evidence against me. In my own house! I am now in the police station waiting for this to get sorted out, though I'm not sure how. The cops have given me some food, water, a cot, and are all being condescendingly nice to me, as if I dont see it!


I've sneaked away to write this, to try to see if anyone can help me, even with just ideas on how to get out of this. I am being set up, and no one seems to see that.
