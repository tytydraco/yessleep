**Day 1 - Arrival**

Ray, Kara, Rueben, and Chuck were thrilled to escape the mundane, embarking on a wilderness adventure in northern Canada. The locals warned them, their eyes hollow, about the curse that plagued those woods—a forgotten land where people vanished without a trace. But the friends dismissed the stories as folklore, too eager to conquer nature’s raw beauty to heed the warnings.

With equipment packed and spirits high, they ventured into the dense forest. The first day was peaceful, almost idyllic, the trees whispering secrets only the wind could hear. That night, as they gathered around the campfire, an unnatural stillness settled over the forest. The flames flickered weakly, as if suppressed by a force unseen, but none of them noticed. The mage had marked them.

**Day 2 - The First Signs**

As they continued the next day, the trail grew faint, almost as if the forest itself was swallowing their path. The trees towered above, their twisted branches clawing at the sky, and the temperature plummeted. The sun was a distant memory as a bone-chilling cold settled in, a prelude to the storm that was brewing in the mage’s lair.

They set up camp early, the blistering cold forcing them to seek shelter. As they huddled around a struggling fire, Kara let out a gasp. Strange, guttural whispers surrounded them, carried on the icy wind. It was as if the forest was alive, speaking in tongues no human could comprehend. Chuck tried to laugh it off, but his voice trembled. That night, Kara was tormented by a nightmare so vivid it left her screaming. She described a shadowed figure standing over her, its eyes glowing with malevolence. The others dismissed it as a dream, but she knew something had found them.

**Day 3 - The Rot**

By the third day, the land itself seemed diseased. They stumbled upon a patch of forest where life had ceased to exist—trees blackened and twisted, the ground oozing with a foul, sticky substance. The air was thick with the stench of decay, almost suffocating. Ray insisted they push on, despite the growing dread gnawing at their minds.

The forest felt tighter, the trees leaning in as if to close them off from the world. The temperature fluctuated wildly—blistering heat followed by numbing cold. They were in the mage’s grip now, his powers warping reality around them.

That night, Kara vanished without a sound.

**Day 4 - The Search**

Panic set in with the dawn. Ray, Rueben, and Chuck tore through the forest, calling for Kara, but the forest swallowed their cries. It was as if the land itself was shifting, twisting their sense of direction until they were hopelessly lost. Desperation led them back to their last camp, where they found Kara’s backpack discarded in the snow. The ground beneath it was scorched, the earth still smoldering from intense heat. No tracks, no sign of struggle—just emptiness.

As night fell, a suffocating darkness descended, and with it came a cold unlike anything they had ever felt. It pierced through their clothing, gnawing at their flesh. Ray saw him again—the figure, standing at the edge of the clearing. It was the same figure from Kara’s nightmare, its eyes burning with hellish fire. Ray blinked, and it was gone, leaving only a bone-deep fear that he could not shake.

**Day 5 - The Cabin**

Driven by fear, they stumbled upon a decrepit cabin hidden deep in the woods. Its walls were blackened with age, the windows shattered, and the door hung loosely on its hinges. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of rot and old blood. They barricaded themselves inside, hoping the walls would keep out whatever was hunting them.

Rueben found an ancient journal hidden beneath a floorboard, its pages yellowed and crumbling. It spoke of a mage who once lived in these woods, a man who had forsaken his humanity for the dark arts. His power was unmatched, his cruelty legendary. The journal detailed his spells—fireball to incinerate flesh, blizzard to freeze the blood in your veins, and rot to decay the body from within. The last entry was a desperate plea for help, written in blood.

Chuck tried to dismiss it as a relic of the past, but fear was etched in every line of his face. Ray knew the journal was a warning—a premonition of their fate.

**Day 6 - The First Encounter**

Chuck was the first to fall. He woke in the early hours, his skin pale and clammy, eyes wide with terror. The rot had taken hold, spreading through his body like wildfire. His flesh blackened and peeled away, revealing raw, weeping muscle beneath. He screamed, his voice ragged as the disease consumed him from the inside out. Ray and Rueben could only watch in horror as Chuck’s body collapsed, leaving behind nothing but a shriveled, rotting husk.

But there was no time to mourn. The door burst open, and the mage stepped inside. The temperature plummeted, frost creeping across the floor. His cloak was tattered, hanging like shadows around him, and his eyes—those terrible, burning eyes—locked onto them. Rueben tried to flee, but the mage raised a hand, a fireball forming in his palm. Rueben’s body ignited in an instant, his flesh searing and bubbling as he was reduced to ashes. His screams echoed long after his body was gone, lingering in the air like a curse.

Ray ran, the mage’s laughter following him into the night.

**Day 7 - The Escape**

Ray fled, his mind shattered. The forest closed in around him, the mage’s power twisting the land, warping it into a living nightmare. Firestorms raged, blizzards howled, and the rot spread wherever Ray set foot. He ran until his lungs burned, his body numb with exhaustion, but he couldn’t stop. The mage was always there, just out of sight, watching, waiting.

Dawn broke, and somehow, Ray stumbled out of the forest, collapsing on the edge of the treeline. He was found by a search party, barely clinging to life, his skin frostbitten, his mind broken. They took him to the nearest hospital, where he told his story, but no one believed him. They said it was trauma, exposure, a figment of his imagination.

But Ray knew the truth. The mage was still out there, lurking in the forgotten lands, waiting for the next unfortunate souls to cross into his domain. And Ray was left with one burning question: why had the mage spared him?

The journal he had taken from the cabin held the answer, but Ray wasn’t ready to face it. Not yet. But he would, one day, when the nightmares became too much to bear, and the mage’s laughter echoed too loudly in his mind.

**Epilogue**

Ray’s body healed, but his mind remained scarred. The mage’s voice whispered to him in the dark, pulling him back to the cursed forest, to the place where it all began. He knew that he would return, not as a victim, but as something else—something darker.

The forgotten lands called to him, and Ray knew that his story wasn’t over. The mage had left his mark, and Ray would carry it with him until the day he returned to face the darkness once more.
