First of all, I should introduce myself. My name is Marco, I’m 26 years old, and I was born in Santa Helena, a small town just 60 miles from São Paulo, in Brazil. At its peak, the town had 12000 inhabitants. But nowadays, after all of the strange phenomena that occured in the last decade, the majority of the population decided to move out of town, leaving no more than 2000 people still living there. The first bizarre event I remember happened while I was still in highschool, almost 10 years ago. Inexplicably, all of the crops around the town began to die. The soil just became infertile overnight. Many tried, but nobody could come up with any reason why that could happen. And still to this day, the soil just can’t grow crops as it once did.

The second thing was the babies. The mothers were giving birth to deformed babies. Some of them were slight deformations; an extra finger, a malformed limb, a missing ear. But a few were straight out of a nightmare. The worst case I know was from a kid named Jaime. All of his limbs were switched. His head came out of the groin, an arm stretched out of where the head should be, and legs came out of his shoulders. May God rest his soul. That was the last straw for many people that fled the town, saying the Devil himself had cursed that land. I have never been religious, but looking back now, I agree with them. That same year I got a scholarship in one of the most renowned universities in São Paulo. I was gonna study Journalism, and my parents saw that as an opportunity to move out of Santa Helena, so the three of us moved to São Paulo.

Although we got out of Santa Helena, we still heard a lot from it since a few relatives still live there. A bit over a year after we moved, earthquakes began to hit the town. Brazil is completely on top of the South American tectonic plate, so earthquakes are very, very rare, and when they happen, it's never above 3 on the Richter Scale. The Santa Helena earthquakes could be as high as 6.5. And there’s one more thing. One more curse that engulfs the town I was born and raised in.

Just 10 months ago, a woman named Maria Pedrosa was brought into the Santa Helena General Hospital by her husband, Jorge. He told the doctors they went to sleep as normal on the night before, but when Jorge woke up, Maria was nowhere to be found. He left the house shouting her name, roaming around the otherwise barren suburbs. Until he saw a figure in the dark. The sun had just begun to rise. He ran towards the figure, and when he reached them, he was relieved. His wife was alive and well. At least, he thought so. He hugged and called her name, but she didn't respond. She looked through him as he was made of glass. Her eyes vacant and still, her hair messy like she had just woken up. He screamed, begged, pleaded for any reaction, but to no avail. He got her in his arms and ran to the hospital.

She was alive, but completely unresponsive. An MRI was requested right away. Jorge waited hours. He could see the movement of the doctors and nurses. He could see their confused gazes, the mumbled discussions, the anxiety could chew his bones clean. They did the MRI again. And again. And then they said it.

- Jorge, we don’t know how to say this. We don't know how that's even possible. But your wife’s brain is missing. The brain is completely gone, without a trace.

No words would be capable of describing what must’ve gone through Jorge’s mind. “How’s that possible? What do you mean? Are you fucking serious?” All Jorge could do is cry. She stayed at the hospital for a week, when her heart finally stopped.

Maria is one of the 123 victims of the Vanishing, as it was called. Something that is beyond anyone’s comprehension. A mystery that no one can solve. I was never in love with the town. I need to go back. I need to go back to Santa Helena and find out what the fuck is going on. I can’t take this anymore. Me and my friend Leo are going back to Santa Helena, and we will uncover the truth.
