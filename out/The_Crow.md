The crow is back again.

Like clockwork, we show up at the same time every week.

I’ve tried coming earlier in the day, later in the day, middle of the night.

It’s always there.

Waiting for me.

Perched atop Todd’s grave, the marble headstone shimmering the soft reflection of moonnight, the bird sits.

It does not usually squawk, chirp, or coo.

The black, ominous bird just watches me.

Tonight, I brought hydrangeas. I always found hydrangeas to be the most peaceful flower.

I lay the bouquet on top of the already regrown grass, and sit beside them.

The crow shifts to get a better view of my now lowered height, I peer up at it with raised eyebrows.

The crow glares hard.

I sigh, and redirect my attention to the headstone.

“I’m sorry I’m later this week. Work has been killing me- Sorry, that’s insensitive of me to say..”, I start, laughing dryly at my own words.

I wipe my hands on my thighs, I get clammy whenever I visit Todd. I want to blame the bird, but I can’t fully.

“Anyways, nothing super interesting to report. Ana is pregnant, again, so I’ll have another niece or nephew soon. The farmers market stand I liked that made the fresh salsa is gone, I think they went out of business. Work is.. fine. Busy, but fine..”

I trail off, before placing my hand over his name carved into marble.

“And I’m so sorry, I wish you were still here.”

I feel my eyes well up, and I quickly brush any tears away before they can fall.

I take a shaking breath, and stand, wiping the dirt off my knees.

I hear a small flutter of wings, and I look again to the crow, tilting its head to look at me.

“I know I’m late, I’m sorry.”, I say to it.

It finally makes a noise, it squawks loudly in my direction, flaring its wings at me as if to say it knows I’m not sorry.

I inhale deeply.

The crow’s gaze feels like it burns straight to my soul, as it has felt every single day since I’ve seen it.

When I was driving home late one evening, down a rural path. I had just been in a fight with my boyfriend, my mind was elsewhere.

I didn’t see him.

A figure had walked out into the road, too quickly, his face turned and his eyes widened as he saw me approaching.

It happened so fast.

The impact was the worst noise I’ve ever heard.

I tried to turn, but it was no help.

I ran right over him, I knew I did.

I panicked. I was trying to get partner at my job, if something like this became known at my work.. I would be done.

So I left.

I sped away, and once I reached a gas station I put in an anonymous call that there had been an accident.

That night I watched the news religiously, hoping someone had helped that poor boy.

His name was Todd.

Apparently he left a local party and was taking a shortcut home, he had been drinking and didn’t want to drive.

He was a kid, a teenage boy, he had just been offered a full-ride to study medicine.

And I killed him, because I wasn’t paying attention.

The crow came the next morning.

I was leaving my apartment to go to work, when I saw it perched on a streetlight.

It was.. focused on me.

Its gaze said “I know what you did.”

I thought it was a coincidence, and I knew the guilt was eating me alive, so I just hurried along.

But the crow came with me.

Work, restaurants, grocery shopping..

The crow was always waiting for me.

The crow would follow me, squeak and squawk at me loudly enough to gain attention.

The only way to make it stop, I’ve learned, is visiting Todd every week.

I bring flowers every time, and talk to Todd about my life. I’ve kept up with his family from the news, and I’ll give him updates about them.

This seems to keep the crow at bay.

It’s been 5 years, and I visit Todd every week.

When I don’t come, the crow follows me.

It always finds me.

I know how to make it stop, I know if I confess it will stop.

But I just… can’t.

I’ll visit Todd every week for the rest of my life if I have to.

As long as the guilt doesn’t eat me alive first.
