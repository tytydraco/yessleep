I opened my mailbox, and pulled the small group of envelopes from within. I shuffled through the typical bills and junk, pausing when I came to a parcel that was different than the others. It was a small, rectangle, wrapped in a deep purple paper with small stars printed on it. It felt to me like those little gift card boxes that you can find at stores around the holidays. It looked like one as well, but was obviously a custom job, being the same color, with the same celestial design that the paper had on it. I opened the top and found a a plastic card inside as I expected.

There was no branding on the front of the glossy plastic object, and on the back there was a magnet strip like those along with an address. I typed that into google, but all of the information about the building said it was empty. The place was in an industrial area on the edge of the city, and I hesitated to go visit it. I went to work the ne next morning, the card beginning to fade from my memory. I only remembered it when I opened my wallet to buy a cup of coffee, the small plastic square catching my eye.

I pulled it from the card slot as I walked back out to my car, and tapped the address into my GPS. I was curious, I admit. That feeling only deepened as I neared the place and noticed that almost everything around it was shuttered, the lots empty and quiet. The only place that had cars parked outside was the one I had been invited to. I parked next to a rather expensive looking sports car and glanced around as I exited my car. I started toward what seemed to be the main entrance, but that was dark.

There was, however an arrow painted on the sidewalk. I followed the direction it was pointing. There was another arrow, then another. The trail led me to a door with a card reader above the knob. I extracted the card from my wallet and slid it through the slot on the electronic device. The light turned green and I heard a soft click. I reached out and turned the handle, and when I stepped through I could hear the faint murmur of conversation. I walked along the hallway in front of me coming to an intersection. The corridors to my left and right were blocked by rolling gates.

I continued toward the sound of voices which had been growing louder as I pushed further into the building. I arrived at a large room that looked completely out of place. There was an expensive looking carpet on the floor. There were large, overstuffed couches and chairs dotting the floorspace. Men and women lounged, drinks in their hands. There seemed to be a fully stocked bar on the western wall. A man near the counter seemed to notice me, and started walking in my direction. He was middle aged, and slightly taller than myself with slick silver hair.

He smiled as he drew nearer.

“First time here?” he enquired.

“Is it that obvious?” I asked in return.

“Not really, I just don't recognize you.” the tall man replied with a quiet chuckle.

“Is this your place?” I prodded, motioning to the lavish room around us.

“Oh, no. I'm what you might call the manager.” the slick-haired man replied, putting his arm around my shoulder, herding me toward the bar. I didn't resist, my legs moving at the other man's pace. When we reached the counter he ordered two beers.

The bartender placed a bottle in front of each of us and popped the top right there on the counter. There were no labels on the bottles, either, I gave my host a quick glance, and tried to bite my tongue, not wanting to ask a stupid question, but my curiosity got the better of me.

“What is this place?” I asked.

The man smiled and rolled his shoulders in a slight shrug. “It's a club of sorts. I am not at liberty to say much more than that.”

I felt my eyelid twitch. This whole situation wasn't just strange, it was wrong. A posh clubhouse inside an abandoned factory? In what world did that make any sense? I took another sip of the beer. It was good. I was about to ask another question when *He* walked in. There was no question that this was the owner of the place from the moment one saw him. Dressed in an expensive, likely custom black suit with a rich purple shirt and a tie a few shades lighter than the shirt. He seemed to radiate an aura of respect.

His emerald green eyes were clear and bright, his hair a light brown with subtle red highlights. I watched the man as he stopped to talk to a small group of people sitting at the other end of the room.

“That would be the man who runs this establishment. If you want to know more, then I suggest speaking with him. Don't be intimidated, he is quite approachable.” the manager said when he noticed that I was staring.

That broke whatever had come over me, and my eyes blinked. I took another drink of the beer and then started moving in the owner's direction. He seemed to sense my approach, eyes moving toward me even while he was still in the middle of a conversation.

“Are you new?” he asked, and I thought I saw a faint glimmer in his green eyes.

“Yes, it's my first time here.” I answered.

“Let me show you around.” the man in the purple shirt and dark suit offered with a smile.

“There's more to this place?” I blurted.

The other people around us, who I had practically forgotten about laughed, and the owner of the place chuckled again as well.

“A whole lot more. Come, this way.” he said, then stepped past me.

I pivoted and followed, brushing off the minor embarrassment I had felt a moment before. The other man led me to a door that I hadn't noticed before on the other side of the bar. That opened onto a set of utilitarian looking stairs that descended into a dimly lit space below. I followed the man in the suit down and again I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was a betting parlor, complete with banks of screens on each wall.

“Is this legal?” I asked, and the owner laughed, a single, loud guffaw, as if I had caught him off guard. I blinked.

“Of course. I have all the necessary licenses.” he replied with a grin.

I felt a touch of relief. We didn't stop there, the stranger leading me down another flight of stairs and as we approached the large metal door I could hear the pounding of music. There was a full on nightclub on the third level.

“This concludes our tour, and welcome to the Lavender Room.” my host said jubilantly, voice just loud enough to be heard over the music.

With that, the mysterious man turned and walked away. I wandered back up the stairs to the gambling area, glancing at my phone. It was already five in the evening. Time seemed to be flying, but I decided to play a few hands of Blackjack. From there I went and danced for a while. Before I knew it, the hour had slipped past midnight. I couldn't believe that six hours had gone by, and on top of that, I was actually up, though I didn't spend the whole time playing cards. I took a few chances on the roulette wheel as well, and had actually won. I went home, and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

As soon as my eyes opened late the next morning, I felt a temptation to return to the place I had been the night before. I also knew that I couldn't go straight back there. I had to go to work for one thing. For another, my stomach was so empty that I felt nauseous. I ate a rather large breakfast and went through the rest of my morning routine. I was almost late by the time I pulled out of my driveway. I was distracted while working, my mind drifting back to the place I had been the night before. The man who had given me the tour had appeared in my mind often as well.

As soon as I clocked out, I drove toward the mostly abandoned portion of the city. To my surprise, there was more traffic and more cars in the small lots. The lot outside the Lavender Room was a little more occupied as well. The first floor was practically a ghost town, only a few people sitting on the scattered furniture, so I proceeded lower. The betting room was nearly too packed to move, and there were several sporting events happening on the wall of monitors, and I took the opportunity to place a bet before sitting in one of the booths.

An attractive woman approached after a few minutes.

“Would you like a menu, sir?” the server asked, and I blinked.

“Sure.” I replied.

She nodded and disappeared for less than a minute. She returned with a small, laminated pamphlet, laying that in front of me, walking away again. I picked it up and skimmed over the choices, settling on a burger and a bottle of house-brewed beer. I had assumed that was what came in the unlabeled bottle I had been given the night before. My suspicion was confirmed when my items arrived at the table. I ate quickly and just as rapidly lost the money on the team I placed a bet on after my dinner. I was disappointed but not totally defeated as I sat at the roulette table.

I placed a five dollar bill on the table and was given a single chip in return. I placed that on 32 red. To my surprise, the ball bounced into that slot. I placed both chips on another number, red again. And I won. Four spins later, and I had recouped my losses from the football game. I lost track of time again, sipping the house-brewed beer and playing different table games until well after midnight again. The next morning brought a vicious hangover that led me to take the day off from work. I spent most of the early morning trying to rid myself of the headache.

A few doses of ibuprofen helped, and as soon as I felt stable enough to eat, I did so, already mentally retreating to the Lavender Room. I closed my eyes and felt like I was there. I could smell the mixture of cologne and perfumes that lingered in the air. I could hear the faint music playing through the hidden speakers, and for a moment, even smelled smoke. That part wasn't a dream. I opened my eyes to find flickering light beyond my partially open doorway. I sat up and scrambled to grab my wallet and phone as well as a change of clothes, then climbed through my bedroom window.

Once outside and safely on the sidewalk, I called the fire department. After they arrived and spoke to me, I was advised to leave during the investigation, but not to leave town. I considered renting a room, then decided I would go to the Lavender Room instead, and if it was closed as I suspected, I would sleep in the back seat of my car. To my surprise there were still vehicles in the lot. I entered the place and descended the first set of stairs. I needed a drink. I sat at the nearly empty bar and a bartender quickly appeared.

I ordered a shot of whiskey, and he quickly obliged. I ordered another and then another in rapid succession. I had built a rather decent buzz quickly, and was about to order another drink when I became aware of someone standing slightly behind me. I turned to see the man who had called himself the manager upon our first meeting.

“You're becoming a little bit of a regular.” he said.

I nodded and rolled my shoulders in a sort of shrug.

“I guess so.” I finally replied.

“Is something wrong?” the man asked as I ordered another drink.

“My house caught fire, and I didn't know where else to go.” I confessed without thinking.

The man's eyes widened.

“That's just dreadful.” he gasped. “How did it happen?”

“I still don't know the answer to that, and I get the feeling I am a suspect.” I answered bitterly.

I was just signaling the bartender, when the man placed his hand on my forearm, gently pressing it back to the top of the counter.

“We have a few rooms for rent, if you need a place to stay.” the man informed me.

“Rooms? I don't remember that being part of the tour.” I said, still not quite drunk enough to be incoherent.

He laughed.

“They are not public knowledge, but most of the people here at this hour live here, anyway.” he told me with a grin.

He led me through a set of double doors marked 'Employees Only' and then down a set of stairs beyond what appeared to be a food storage pantry. We descended for more than one level, but there was no landing, or door between the top and bottom of the steps. I was shocked by the interior of the room below the structure. It looked like the lobby of a real estate office, with art on the walls, brass fixtures and a dark wooden desk where a woman in a pantsuit sat. She smiled when she saw us approaching.

“Got a new resident?” she asked with a gentle smile, her eyes on the manager rather than me.

“Short term, I believe.” he said and the woman's smile grew as she turned her attention to me.

“May I have your identification and credit card?” she asked, and after tapping my information into the system she glanced toward me.

“Do you want to stay for a night or longer?' she asked.

“At least three nights.” I replied.

As soon as I got into my room, I fell into an exhausted sleep. The next day I didn't leave except to eat at the club on the top floor. Before I knew it, it had been a week, and I had been fired. I didn't care. I still had the insurance money coming in, as I had been cleared of any wrong doing. Before long, I had forgotten about the outside world. At some point I began working here, I don't even know how.

I want to leave this place, but feel like I have grown roots.
