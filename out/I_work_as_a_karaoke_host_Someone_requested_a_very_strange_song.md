I work a lot of side hustles, as you do to make ends meet in this economy. One of them is hosting karaoke at a local club every week. Let me be honest, I love karaoke, I love the club, but it can be a thankless job. People rushing me to have their turn next. People not responding no matter how many times I call them to the stage (including the people begging to be up next just a few minutes ago.) Technical issues. You know the deal. When I showed up at 9pm, I was relieved that it looked to be a chill night. This means I can get a couple of songs in too.

It was a fairly normal night by all measures. The usual crowd did the usual My Way and Piano Man. I had the club groove to Can’t Get You Out of My Head and mosh to All Signs Point to Lauderdale. It was just past midnight when a man I’ve never seen before walked in, and started writing down his song request on one of the slips we provided.

To give you more info on how karaoke works at our club, we connect YouTube to our TVs and sound systems, so we aren’t limited to the roster of a specific server, and can play anything with a karaoke version on YouTube, including fanmade ones for the more obscure songs and artists. I grabbed the slip once he was done, ready to place it in the pile of requests, noticing that he wrote his name down as “Dis”. “New phone who Dis?” I chuckled at the thought. But seeing the song and artist name puzzled me a lot.

The song name was written down as “Slldfgvbgjh yjbtgwhm” and the artist name was “cbvmntprq jmlygkpzx”.

I looked toward Dis, who was getting a drink at the bar. All in all he looked like a regular guy, nothing out of the ordinary. Average height, blonde hair, dark eyes and a goatee, wearing a plain black T-shirt and faded black jeans. There was a large tattoo on his left forearm, although I couldn’t make out exactly what it was in the dim light.

He was meant to go up next. We prioritise people who haven’t had their first turn yet, so everyone gets a chance. But I needed him to explain this.

Once he had a beer in hand, I gestured him over. He seemed to expect this and walked over immediately. “You’re up next… Dis. You want to do a song called uhhh… whatever this is? And there’s a band actually called this?” I asked curiously.

“Yes, and you have to type it out exactly as I have written it down, or it won’t show up in the search results,” he replied matter-of-factly. “By the way, these are lower case L’s, not capital I’s or number 1’s.”

Oddly specific, I thought as I took extra care to spell every nonsense word exactly as he had written. I did make a mistake the first time, ending up with no search results except “you might also like this” videos in the suggestions. He graciously corrected that I should have typed “cbvmntprq” instead of “cbvmntpqr”.

And there it was - only one search result. Even the suggestions were gone. The title of the video was written in some kind of script that I didn’t recognise at all. I studied linguistics at university, so I could recognise many different writing systems - even very uncommon ones - but this was something I’d never seen before. You know those “cursed text” memes where writing is generated to look glitched and incomprehensible? That’s the closest example I could think of, but it wasn’t that either.

I pointed at the screen. “This one?”

Dis nodded. I announced his turn on the mic as he made his way to the stage. But before he did so, he had one last request for me. “Make sure you stay in the box. Don’t come out until my song’s done.”

Huh, a little weird but okay. By the way, we host from a boxed-in area that we have to step in and out of with a deck around us, kind of like a DJ’s booth. Anyway, his requests would probably have freaked me out more if his voice wasn’t so soothing. I felt comforted despite it all. I wondered what his singing voice would sound like.

At this point, the indoor space of the club was quite empty as most attendees were congregated outside smoking and socialising. The few people inside weren’t paying the singers much mind - chatting amongst themselves, cuddling their partners, ordering drinks, scrolling on their phones. That quickly changed once Dis began his performance.

My confusion only increased once I hit play. The instrumentals formed a lush, sweeping pad that didn’t follow the rules of tones and semitones like the majority of western music. Sure, plenty of cultures around the world don’t subscribe to the rigid confines of western music theory; however the chords and tonal shifts did not just sound unfamiliar, but inexplicable; as though they were not meant to be processed by the human mind.

As soon as the music began, I could feel the air in the club change. The people going about their own business perked up and stared at the stage, a look of intrigue on each of their faces. People started walking inside, almost as if drawn by some magnetic force.

I looked at Dis. Under the bright light of the stage, I could finally see what his tattoo was. A human body, with a pentagram wrapped around - though the lines making up the pentagram weren’t perfectly straight. They were wriggly - like they were ropes, or worms.

And the words that escaped his lips - if you could call them words. I don’t know how to describe it better, but there were consonants I’d never heard before. Vowels I’d never heard before. Sounds that no human could plausibly pronounce - forget that, sounds that human ears should not be capable of registering. Sounds that should not exist in this universe.

I wanted to get out, but I remembered him telling me to stay in the box. More and more people poured into the club, each of them transfixed by Dis. Their individual personalities gone from their faces, all staring at the stage with the same mesmerised expression. Hypnotised. Possessed, even.

Then the music started “rising” for lack of a better word. The “sounds” that Dis “sang” intensified.

And people began clawing at their stomachs.

I don’t remember when the first splatters of blood began, but soon enough the floor was covered. They splashed onto the walls. Smeared onto the sides of the host’s box I stood in. A few drops got onto my skin and clothes.

I had to get out now. But I could no longer move. It was as if a force field was keeping me still. I felt like screaming, but I couldn’t make a sound. I felt as though I should be nauseous, but nausea could no longer physically arise within me.

I could only watch and listen. Dis continued pronouncing the unpronounceable, against the instrumental that was an auditory impossibility. And the audience kept going, no cries or facial expressions of pain. As if what they were doing was a normal routine.

One by one they tore through their abdominal muscles. I didn’t know it was possible for humans to have the strength to do so - or it wasn’t, because whatever was happening was unquestionably supernatural. One by one they ripped out their intestines - and began entangling their own guts around themselves. Gradually, they began to form shapes.

Pentagrams. Like the tattoo on the singer’s forearm.

As the “song” came to a conclusion, the entire crowd collapsed into a heap. The faces above their horrifically mangled bodies wrapped in five-point stars looked satisfied and serene.

I fell to my knees, my head rested against the deck next to a still thick pile of song requests. His footsteps came over. I didn’t want to speak, yet I had so many questions.

Who is Dis?

The phrase no longer amused me.

As I sensed his gaze over me, I had no choice but to ask through trembling breaths.

“Who… are you?”

“I am Dis. **Dis Pater**.”

“And why… why did you spare me?”

“Because I’ve been looking for the right one to work with me - and it’s you.”
