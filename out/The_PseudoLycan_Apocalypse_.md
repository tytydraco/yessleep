The tranquilizers were not near as effective as they were in the beginning. Lycan physiology is unpredictable to say the least, but raising the dosage would decrease the number of samples we could collect. We dose for a thirty-minute duration. At that time, we were only a small group, four who lived separately from the rest of the community, and the only ones willing to draw blood from a sleeping werewolf. It seemed we had not tagged appropriately, or that the beasts were removing their tags, for the last few we had shot had only stayed under for less than fifteen minutes.

The last instance, before we suspended operations, involved a curious situation with a beast wandering around the field behind the old warehouse. It was dragging behind it the remains of a smaller werewolf. It was early noted that this species of canine sometimes runs in pack, as a social unit, and at other times acts as solitary individuals ready to kill one another rather than to cooperate. They are veracious carnivores, like sharks, killing and eating anything they come across, including humans, their hunger never satiated. Additionally, they are like swine in that they destroy the environment they inhabit, rooting out vegetation for fodder when meat is unavailable. I call them werewolves, but in truth they are something else. They resemble werewolves, but their skin is light blue and their fur thin and sparse. Their snout is longer than one would imagine a werewolf would have and their incisors are longer and less symmetrical. Yet, the oddest feature is their bat-like ears, long and wide, extending beyond the top of their heads. Some of us have surmised that they use echolocation at night.

It is not a lunar phenomenon as frequently cited in folklore. These were thought to be infected humans. They do not change under the light of a full moon. It is a gradual process, akin to a caterpillar in a cocoon, but without the cocoon. We have observed the metamorphosis in its entirety, from beginning to end. The team had brought into the lab two poor infected souls at the very onset of their transformation, with the most noble of intentions, to save their lives, but in the end we failed. Yet, it was instructive. It is an arduous journey from caterpillar to butterfly, with excruciating pain and misery at every juncture.

First, the skin becomes scaly and loose. The infected is afflicted with sensitive skin, even the slightest touch causes discomfort. It is as if- according to one patient- they are on fire. Next the bones liquify, and their bodies become fleshy sacks of liquid. It is an unrecognizable lump, so far removed from any resemblance to a human being. This state is static for some time, a morphological dead-end, but then all of the sudden the bones began to build themselves back, longer, thicker, and stronger. A beast is growing before your eyes, taller and stronger, if it survives. At this point, most will die. In fact, both our patients did die. Evidently, there is an evolutionary adaptation that acts as a gatekeeper to thwart certain specimens from receiving the full genetic disposition of a werewolf. That was the dilemma, and the question that was before us: if most die from the infection at the point of biogenesis, then how has their population exploded? Additionally, how have we not discovered these beings in the midst of their transformation out in the wild, in which they are vulnerable and most prone to destruction?

Dr. Davis had an idea that we should put the beast under but carry its quarry away to our lab.

“It would be to our advantage I think to dissect the dead one.”

Without further discussion, Manford, a rather capricious fellow, loaded his rifle and began trekking towards the beast.

Dr. Davis, I, and Professor Williams stood aimlessly about, still contemplating the merit of such a proposal, much less what our plan of action would be. Manford was far from stealthy, and the beast was alerted to his approach. It slung the corpse backwards into a high patch of wilted, brown grass and ran towards Manford.

“Dammit Manford,” cursed the Professor.

“If he’s so bold, let him take care of it. Hurry back to the lab,” advised Dr. Davis. They scurried away, but I didn’t follow. Mesmerized, I watched as Manford pulled the rifle close to his shoulder, steadied his finger around the trigger and waited. The ignorant beast never swerved from its line of attack. Manford’s composure was absolute. From about ten feet away, he shot. The report echoed through the empty field. The beast pawed at its neck, stumbled forward a few steps, and slumped to the ground.

“He’s down,” I yelled. I motioned for the others to hurry back.

“Come on you damn cowards!” Manford yelled. He moved quickly to the patch of grass, grabbing at the dead werewolf’s ankles.

I ran past the sedated creature, a behemoth at least eight feet in length, frightening but impressive as well. Manford was struggling to move the body.

“It’s a runt, but it’s heavy as hell. Grab the other ankle.” This specimen was shorter, with thicker than normal fur- at least for this species. It was lying face down with its legs splayed out wide, and its arms tucked beneath its chest, or at least I thought so at first. As I grabbed one ankle and began pulling, I noticed blood flowing from its shoulders. The poor beast had both of its arms torn off.

Dr. Davis and Professor Williams made it to where we were but hesitated to help.

“What are you doing?” asked Manford. “Hurry. Pick up the head and chest. We’ll get it off the ground and run with it.”

“But how do we know it’s dead.”

“Shit! This was your idea.” Manford dropped the ankle and brushed past Dr. Davis. “Move.” He bent down, put his arms under the chest, and lifted the animal off the ground. “Well pick the fucker up!” he demanded.

Dr. Davis and Professor Williams picked up one ankle and I picked up the other. We clumsily made our way back towards the lab. Our progress was slow and fraught with wasted effort. We were far from our destination and the tranquilizer was due to wear off soon.

“Drop it,” I said. Manford refused the order but the other two obeyed willingly. “Take the other ankle Professor. This is ridiculous.” As soon as Manford realized what I was doing he lowered the animal to the ground and positioned himself on the same side as Dr. Davis. He and I picked the animal up by its chest, one on each side. The other two picked it up by the legs.

This new arrangement was working quite well. We moved faster, made our way around the warehouse and across the street, but time had gotten away from us. We weren’t far from the lab when he heard the beast shrieking in the field.

“It’s up. Move faster.”

“Let’s just drop it Manford,” advised Dr. Davis.

Manford growled, and his scowl was as fearsome as the monsters that now plagued our existence.

“You drop it, and I swear I’ll kill your ass!”

The shrieks were getting louder, our pace was slowing down and becoming ever so difficult. My arms were weak and my strength waning. The lab, which was simply the basement of a department store, was in sight. Professor Williams dropped the leg and ran. Unencumbered he quickly made his way towards the front of the store and dashed inside. Dr. Davis, seeing the situation as hopeless, followed suit and did the same.

“Manford, let’s go. Run. It’s over. We’ll regroup,” I said.

We had no more tranquilizer. We could only carry one shot into the field. It was all that was allowed, to avoid the temptation of using more than necessary, a very strict policy on paper, but never enforced, nor ever needed. Drawing blood is an easier task than hauling a robust, dead werewolf through the fields. Manford looked disappointed. I knew he was convinced that an autopsy would be the key to discovering their weakness.

Manford pulled out his Bowie knife and started running towards the lab. I followed after him and we were almost through the door when the beast ran past and crashed through the store window. It slid across the floor, frantically trying to regain its footing. Manford shoved me outside and pulled the door shut and locked it. The shattered window was a ring of bloody shards, the very sight of it boasted of pain, but I doubted it was intimating enough to keep the beast from coming back through. Yet, its full attention was on Manford. Irrationally, I kept tugging at the door, trying to break Manford free.

The beast charged toward him. Manford moved aside at the last moment and shoved his knife in the beast’s neck; its head slammed against the wall. The door at the back of the room slung open as Dr. Davis rushed through it with a pistol in his hand. As the beast struggled to get up from the floor, Dr. Davis shot it in the head.

“Are you fucking kidding me! You’ve had a gun all along. We’ve been risking our lives without any protection other than this useless baby aspirin tranquilizing shit!” Manford exploded.

“We only have so much ammunition. It’s not readily available if you haven’t noticed. This is only for emergencies, like when our perimeter is breached,” Dr. Davis explained.

Manford lowered his voice, “Every time we go out is a potential emergency. Never again do we go out into the field without that pistol, loaded and ready to use.”

Manford surveyed the room, deep in thought and ready to proceed. “Now we have two specimens to dissect.”

It was a laborious task, but we managed to drag the carcasses downstairs to the lab. We laid the smaller werewolf on our makeshift surgery table; a metal work bench we found in the upstairs showroom. To our surprise the smaller werewolf had a distended belly.

“It’s pregnant,” exclaimed Dr. Davis.

“It’s a female?” asked the Professor.

“There’s that PhD at work. Yes, it’s female, unless it’s a damn seahorse,” answered Manford.

Dr. Davis gathered his tools and began operating, cutting the female open, but careful not to cut too deep and mutilate what was inside. He pulled apart the abdomen and made several more precise cuts to the underlying tissue. There inside were six little fetuses, or should I say babies, wrapped in a tangled ball of umbilical cords, fetuses that didn’t look like werewolves or puppies, as one might expect, but rather like human beings. Five were dead and motionless, but the largest one was alive, if barely, but visibly moving and struggling to survive.

“Kill it,” advised the Professor.

“But it’s a baby,” said Dr. Davis.

“It’s a monster.”

We stood there for a long time in silence, contemplating our next move. It was a monster, but it looked like a baby, innocent and helpless. Finally, Manford proposed his own solution.

“Cut it out Doc. I’ll take out in the field and leave it. If there’s any compassion in these things, then something will take of it. If not, then they’ll put it out of its misery.”

Dr. Davis freed the fetus from the mother’s womb and wrapped it in blankets, not for the sake of the child, but because Manford feared being infected, however and if that really happened. Manford took the swaddling infant, demanded the pistol, and headed upstairs. We heard the bell on the entrance door jingle and then there was silence.

Several hours ensued without Manford’s return. It had to be dark outside by then. The worry in the room was palatable. Three intellectuals, strong in academia but weak as hell in the apocalypse. Being able to assess adequately a situation, propose a strong plan and anticipate its consequences, to be a player four steps ahead of the enemy, sounds nice, but it’s bullshit without the willingness to act on it. We were thinkers, not doers. We knew the metallurgy of the sword but were too weak to swing it. We needed Manford for that and if he was dead, we were soon to follow.

Finally, a muffled bell rang upstairs. We had all fallen asleep but sprang up at the sound of footsteps pounding across the ceiling. The door opened; feet shuffled down the stairs. I instinctively grabbed a hammer, hoping I wouldn’t have to use it. Manford appeared at the bottom of the stairwell and stepped into the light. His demeanor was somber and suspicious. He would not look directly at any of us, evading eye contact and keeping his head down. He meandered over to the couch and sat down.

“What took so long?” asked the Professor. “Did you get rid of that thing?”

“They’re underground. That’s why we can’t find them. They’re underground. I went back to the field. I was just going to leave it out in the open near where we had seen the mother. I noticed some tracks and I followed them to a large hole in the ground. If it wasn’t for the tracks, I would have never seen it. It was hidden in the tall grass. I could hear them moving down in the hole. It sounded like…like a whole bunch of them, shrieking at one another, like they were talking. I heard several moving to the entrance. I quickly laid the child next to the hole and moved back to the higher grass.

A group of them came out of the hole, some of them beasts, some of them human, or rather they looked human. They were carrying bodies, pieces of human bodies, disposing of arms, legs, and heads, piling them up next to the hole. They made several trips and as the pile grew, I was shocked to see a face I recognized on one the severed heads. It was getting dark, so I moved closer just to make sure.”

Manford stopped talking, stood up, walked over to the corner of the room, and turned his back towards us.

“Well, what happened?” asked the Professor. There was a long pause. We grew impatient with fear and anticipation.

Manford wheeled around, pistol in hand, and shot the Professor in the face. The Professor fell backwards, twitched and rolled about. When his body stopped moving, Manford resumed his tale.

“When I moved in closer, got close to that pile of body parts, I clearly saw with my own eyes, the head of Professor Williams. This isn’t a virus; this is an invasion.”
