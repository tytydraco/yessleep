\*\* TW for captivity\*\*

There was no beginning or end to my new universe. I could not remember anything except for what it allowed and all it let in was the most horrible things in my life. It let me replay the pain it could physically inflict, with hunger, thirst. By tightening the restraints on my arms and legs until I was begging to have them cut off. The bed I’d slept, dreamed, loved in for so long, had become my prison. Its feeding ground. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was learning every time it fed.



It had to be close in order to eat. I knew when it was mealtime, because I could hear its breath again. Like a grave was being dug, I could feel myself being lowered into it every time it began its ritual. It started by leaving its ceiling perch, and dropping onto me. Its weight made it as impossible to breathe as its putrid smell. It always entered my mind next:



*You spent so much time hiding.*

*No one to protect you then. No one to protect you now.*

*The more you cry, the fuller I get.*

*Your eyes are red with blood. Have you been screaming behind that gag of yours?*

*You smell almost as bad as I do.* 



At a point I had to give in to my body’s functions. Soiling my bed and myself in the process; I’d already learned to live with it. In it. All the while Officer Gedrick bloated, near to bursting a little more every time I looked over.



I can’t tell you if I slept. I dreamt the whole time, though. Of stuff I’d learned to forget or what might happen next. When I wasn’t dreaming, it was feeding. I tried to go somewhere else each time. Sometimes, I succeeded. It was never anywhere good…. But it was somewhere dark and quiet that it couldn’t reach. I wasn’t as lucky as this perfect little place. I missed it when I got dragged back to the rancid, ghastly thing. Where the neighbors rotting flesh rested hungrily against mine. I thought of the dark quiet but it would be quickly replaced with the worst parts of me. Of life. Of this.



It had finished its feeding one night, thunking deep in its throat as I felt it pull away. Laughing.

*Do not worry, Miranda. It won’t be long now.* 



I stared down the length of my body at it; this thing didn’t bother to cloak itself anymore. Its antlers had finally grown through the neighbor’s forehead entirely, it was almost as tall as the room itself. Its teeth had grown through the poor man’s cheeks, protruding unnaturally. I’d grown accustomed to it, like everything else.



*That dead look in your eyes makes me want to eat again.* A prickle of fear went through me, but there was no terror. I was already half dead, covered in my own shit and too exhausted to hope. To try. This was my life until death. Accepting it was the only thing that kept me coherent at all. 



*What, nothing smart, no plans coming up?* This was a trick question. It knew me too well now to not have that answer. Thinking about things like that led it to inflict pain I couldn’t mentally escape… so I stopped trying. I remained silent.

 

*I knew you’d be special when I finally broke you. You’ll see someday.* I closed my eyes, resisting the vague urge to spit at it. The last few remnants of the rage still gave me feelings like that, but acting on them was almost impossible. I listened to it smoothly pull itself up to the ceiling, finally so bare the it was starting to crumble and crack. I heard it move a little more… then, nothing. Nothing until there was creaking upstairs, just above the kitchen. My eyes opened. It was the first time it had left me alone. Was I alone? My breathing sped up as I considered the possibility. Tears pooled when I realized this could be a dream too. It was probably watching me right now, trying to hide its amusement.

*Kill it with fire.*



It was the first memory recall of my own since this began. I fought the urge to scream, it was mine. He was mine. Evan. Evan. 



*His name is Evan and he should be home soon.* A pained giggle bubbled up from somewhere I forgot existed. Either that thing was gone or baiting me, I didn’t care, I could feel the fire I’d forgotten, burning to survive trying to pump my tired limbs full of blood. I almost passed out from the beautiful rush; I would have been in hysterics if I hadn’t missed that feeling so much. 



I looked around like a trapped animal, trying to find anything to use. I was zeroed in on the sound of its movement upstairs while my wrists bled against me trying to see further. Any major movement, and the bed frame would betray me. It would know, come back, and--

I shook my head, cussing against the thought. Against the way my skin crawled. No. Never again. This was my only chance that I had to find a way to take.



"Fuck, " I sighed, letting my head fall back to the pillows. Like that, I was crying again, as quietly as I could. My body still tugged at the ropes eating through my skin. "You should have gone to France," I whispered to myself. My shitty, pathetic, broken, almost dead.... The thought cut off in the light of another. One more thing my body noticed, that took my mind too long to register.



That steaming sack of shit forgot to gag me.



To this day, I have wondered how that happened. It was something so old, with so many souls in its own veins, you'd think it knows and sees all. In a way, it does. It saw I was broken. Broken things don't make a sound. From where I sit, I now wonder if it simply wanted a different type of hunt.



I caught my breath, tried to wet my lips but my throat was so dry. I thought of tastes: lemons, pickles, anything to trick my body into function. It worked as much as it could. I had one shot and I could be dead by the time I was found, but dammit. It would be over. It couldn't wear me. I had to make my position unquestionable so that the neighbors of this sketchy ass apartment complex could not ignore me, couldn't write off the sound. I took one, two, three breaths. 

"HEEEEEEEELP! HELP! HEEEEEEEELP!" 



It was already on me, shrieking, scratching and I laid there, screaming as I felt flesh separate from my chest, my belly--



Pounding came at the door, so hard and loud it shook the whole apartment, something in my throat popped, and my screams hushed to bleeding wheezes. I heard wood splintering as the creature leaped off of me. It clung to the ceiling and glared down at me, shaking so much it confused me. In hindsight, it had to be fury. The kind I could hold too, but was too injured to comprehend. It made a promise.



*If you survive… I’ll find you.* 



I watched it disappear through the broken ceiling as someone busted into my place.  Blood was steadily soaking into the mattress beneath me, I could feel it but couldn’t bring myself to look. I knew it was bad, but the allure of death was just as sweet as the creature said. I could die, and never have to live like this again. I couldn’t feel the pain yet. I still felt the cold. Suddenly a face, a wrinkly, horrified, gorgeous face hovered above mine as a few more bodies moved into the room.



"Linda," I croaked. 



"Oh... oh dear..." the woman seemed to want to hold my face, but she hesitated. She clutched her housecoat instead. I remembered something, something with her. At a time before this eternity I was stuck in.

 

"I wasn't lying," I whispered as someone undid the rope on my right wrist. A flurry and voices and movement filled the place, someone was already on the phone with 911. 



"What's that sweetheart?" She started taking on that distant look. I didn’t have the strength to repeat myself. The world was blurring around its edges. I didn’t know if I was dying or passing out… regardless, I welcomed the dark and quiet. 



I woke up three days later in the hospital. Evan was by my side, looking as tired and terrified as I'd been.

"I'm here. I'm never leaving you again, Mimi." 



They were the first words I heard upon waking up. He stroked my hair so gently, like he might break me. It sent me into a crying fit intense enough that I had to be sedated. I found out later he'd been grounded by a storm system stateside for most of the time I was being tortured, afraid and unable to reach me. He landed in state just a few hours after my hospitalization. That's when he learned the extent of my injuries; the heel of my foot became infected during my captivity. It took a few hundred stitches to sew the ribbons of my torso together. Miraculously, the mauling didn't hit anything vital. I wonder now if that was intentional. To top it all off,  I had a rash from where I was forced to lie and was severely dehydrated. Still, my prognosis was good with the help of antibiotics and fluids. 



When I woke up again, there was someone else there with Evan. He looked familiar, but wrong somehow. I studied the man until he finally turned to me, so I could see all of him. He was out of uniform, but I knew that face.



"Officer Palmer," I whispered, throat burning. He looked like he was caught doing something wrong. Evan rushed to my side, picking up a styrofoam cup.

"Are you thirsty? How are you doing baby?" I nodded, not quite processing what was going on as he handed it to me. He sat down in the chair he’d basically lived in since he got off the plane.



"He was telling me about his first visit to you. About the other...." Evan trailed off, seeming upset and uncomfortable. I looked at Palmer. Loss was written all over his tired face. 



"I'm sorry about your partner."



"I-I'm sorry. No. We left you."



"He came back," I said, wincing at a particularly painful twinge in my throat. "That's why it killed him." The young Officer blinked, making a brave attempt at keeping his composure. I reflexively flinched as Evan stood, and I watched revulsion flicker across his sweet face. To be replaced by sadness.



"I'm sorry--"



"No," he said, gently taking my hand. He squeezed it and turned to the policeman.



"You don't seem surprised by the term 'it', Officer. What do you know?" Palmer looked between the two of us. I could see how pained he was, how bad he wanted to run.



"Your injuries resemble an animal attack. You were tied up, which suggests a different story. When we searched the unit above you to investigate that previous disturbance... It was a nightmare. I don't think anything human could have done what we saw, but we're still working through bodies." The pale officer licked his lip, looking as if he couldn’t quite believe what he was saying.



"Officer Gedrick warned me as we left your place. I wasn’t sure what to do with it–" 



"About?" Evan stepped closer; I could tell he was trying to make up for being gone, to be strong for me. He still does. I love him for it. He probably would have questioned the whole damn department if we didn’t have to run.



"He said we'd be seeing some messed up stuff soon. I don't think he had any idea that he'd...." 



Palmer trailed off, putting his hands in his pockets. "It didn't kill you, though. You didn't let it kill you."



"It didn't want to," I said, staring at my shredded wrists. Remembering its weight. Its smell. I swallowed bile. 



"It wanted to eat."



I left the hospital two days later. That same day, I moved in with my boyfriend. As in I took my phone, the hospital clothes and blanket. I refused to return to the place I used to call home. It was only then that Evan mentioned my neighbor, Linda. 



"What did you mean when you told her you didn't lie?" The memory was hazy but I told him how I'd texted her, about her response. He frowned. 



"Could this monster thing have messed with that?" I wasn't sure but it did blank out my photo proof. It isn't far-fetched that it could have manipulated a text too. I can still hear its ancient voice in my head, its sinister promise. I relayed it to him then. It was his idea to go on the run, and I believe even now, that it was the best choice. I tried to get Evan to stay, then I tried to send him back. When he stubbornly refused, I tried to send him on. Told him I would meet up with him when we weren’t so close to capture. He was determined to be by my side. We got a little more time and I will forever be grateful for that.



It’s been almost a month since then. We’ve hidden in caves, cellars, abandoned barns and houses to get by. I have library passes in a few states from trying to research what we’re up against. We at least had the foresight to have me be the one burdened with that specific knowledge. Knowing is like a beacon for it. For them. I could tell you by name, species, and origin what it is, but then it could be drawn to you. We almost had it figured out, we just haven't been able to puzzle how to trap it in a fiery grave. Its abilities made the task feel insurmountable but we tried. It wasn’t until we stopped here that I realized, whether or not we kill the one that found me is irrelevant. I know it. Almost as well as it knows me. That means I will always be a target. What I’ve felt skulking on our heels may not even be the same one, just another monster that wanted to hunt. Maybe they’re all the same one, with different hides. 



I don’t know how I could have avoided reaching the point we have, but I can promise. We’ve done our best. You need to do better. 



Because just a bit ago, I woke up to creaking and footsteps above the bed that Evan is still fast asleep in, with nothing but open sky above us. I want to believe it was a nightmare. A product of trauma and sleep. That I have a chance at a life if we get going right now and keep running. 



There it is. 



I can hear it again. 



There's a step. 



Another. 



It was right about me. About humans. There really is a point in all of us, where we would rather die than suffer ever again. I feel the cold now.  I can smell rotting earth. It reeks of defeat... A loss Evan nor I will suffer. We will hold each other. I will whisper soothing words to him about this love we built. Then, I will spare us both from our fates, before it decides to feed.
