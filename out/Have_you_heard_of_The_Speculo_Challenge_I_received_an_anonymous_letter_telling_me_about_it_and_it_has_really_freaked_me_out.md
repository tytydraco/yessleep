 

Yesterday morning, I found a letter on my doormat. It came in a white envelope, with no address on either side and no stamp. ‘DO TRY THIS AT HOME’ was written in big, red capitals on the front (handwritten, not printed). 

I found the contents of the letter really disturbing and I just knew you guys would be the right audience to share it with. And it’s not just what the letter says, the tone of it also creeps me out. A lot of the time the ‘voice’ sounds old-fashioned, but sometimes it’s a little bit mischievous and sometimes it’s just, well, plain evil. Oh, and btw, the entire letter was written by hand (who even does that anymore?!) in red ink over several pages of unlined, white paper. The writing was really hard to decipher at times, quite the messy scrawl, but I’m pretty sure I got it all down in the end and have managed to type it up accurately for you. 

Anyway, here it is, so you can see for yourselves. (I imagine it’s unlikely, but if anyone else has received anything like this, I would really like to know!)

\--------------------------------------- 

*To Whom It May Concern,*

*Have you recently been looking for something truly worthwhile to do, inside the comfort of your own home?* 

*Yes?* 

*If that is the case, then ‘The Speculo Challenge’ might be exactly for you, friend.*

*Mind you, we are obliged to inform you that no human being has ever managed to complete ‘The Speculo Challenge’. You should know this from the outset, in order to avoid disappointment.*

*The task itself does not seem uncommonly difficult, at least in theory. In practice it is quite possibly the most difficult thing you will ever do or try to do.* 

*It is very easy to explain what the task involves.* 

*You must remain alone inside a room, constantly staring at yourself in a mirror, from dusk until dawn!* 

*That is all. That is it. That is everything.* 

*No embellishments are necessary, by which we mean that the mirror can be a perfectly ordinary mirror, and there are no rituals to complete, no candles to light, no artefacts or DNA samples to collect, no spells in Latin to incantate. You only need to face yourself in a mirror, unguarded, from the hour of twilight through the gradual onset of late evening darkness, then onwards through the coal-black fullness of night until the burgeoning light of dawn returns the room to a state of natural illumination.* *In other words, you must experience the full spectrum of light to dark and eventually back to light, all whilst keeping your eyes firmly locked on the person, the you-but-not-really-you on the other side of the mirror.*

*The mirror should preferably be free-standing and full-length and positioned in such a way that you can see the entirety of your reflection. It is of course highly preferable to be sitting down for the entire duration of the trial, so you should use a comfortable high back chair, or perhaps even a fully upholstered single armchair. These are recommendations, of course, not stipulations. Should your legs be sturdy enough, you might decide to stand in front of the mirror for the duration, but the majority of people who have attempted the challenge have chosen, rather sensibly, to try and sit out the night.*

*You may occasionally look away from the face of the you-figure behind the glass, but this should not be for a period of more than a few seconds, a minute at most. Note that while there is no direct third-party monitoring of the event and you must be the only person in the room during the length of the trial, failure to follow this simple rule will result in automatic failure.* *In other words, cheat and you will not receive the grand reward for fulfilling the requirements of ‘The Speculo Challenge’. You will have failed.* 

*You are a failure.*

*That will be the end.*

*Please note that in absolutely no form whatsoever, audio or visual, should you attempt to record any of the events of the night.* 

*It bears emphasizing that ‘The Speculo Challenge’ is a stern test both of body and mind. It is therefore a good idea to prepare for the challenge by eating well and getting at least two or three consecutive restful nights’ sleeps in the lead up to the valiant attempt.* *During the actual challenge, it might not be easy to stay awake in the first few hours, although as the night progresses, your state of wakefulness will become easier to maintain and eventually it is certain to become inevitable.*

*Not everyone should attempt ‘The Speculo Challenge’. People who suffer from any kind of bodily ailment or mental malady should stay away. Depression sufferers, those of you with a nervous disposition or who tend to experience anxiety-related symptoms (especially if a medical practitioner has diagnosed you with Generalised Anxiety Disorder), we are AFRAID this test is decidedly not for you.* *Even if you consider yourself healthy in both mind and body, you should entertain the possibility that you are not always the best or most objective judge of your current physical and mental state.* 

*That is why, we are delighted to report, an exercise has been designed to rule out any candidates who are not suitable for progression to the full, formidable challenge.*

*The following simple exercise must be conducted during the relative safety of daytime. The location should be a bathroom inside your own home. You are merely required to stand in front of your bathroom mirror for a full minute, staring at yourself.* *You will need to set up an alarm to sound at the end of the sixty seconds.* *Most people tend to use their mobile phone alarm or egg timer for this task, but any electronic or mechanical timer will do.*

*You should attempt this ‘taster’ exercise right now, before continuing to read any further about ‘The Speculo Challenge’.* 

*Go on. Try it now.* 

*Stand in front of your bathroom mirror, start the timer and then look directly at your face for an entire minute. Really look. There is no reason to feel afraid. We will still be here when you get back.*

*DO IT!* 

*Welcome back. Do not worry, everything is okay, you will be fine. Now kindly answer these three questions.*

*1)* *Did it seem longer than a minute, a lot longer perhaps, before the alarm finally went?* 

*2)* *Did you feel in full control of your reflection throughout, or did you feel that said control might have been lost at any moment?* 

*3)* *Specifically this ; as the seconds ticked down, did you feel as if the other you on the other side of the mirror was about to open its mouth and speak, even if you, that is the ‘real’ you, standing on the marginally safer side of the glass, had absolutely no intention to do the same?*

*If the answer to any of these three questions is yes, then we strongly recommend that you desist from taking part in ‘The Speculo Challenge’. Sorry, but you are not a viable candidate.* *The priming exercise has demonstrated that you are not sufficiently stable to progress to a full attempt and the best advice we can give you in this instance is to try and forget altogether that ‘The Speculo Challenge’ even exists, or if that proves impossible, to at least make a mental note that for the rest of your life you will not look into a mirror for any longer than is absolutely necessary.* *Additionally, as a failed candidate, it is highly recommended that you do not read any further. We thank you for your time.*

*If, on the other hand, you actually enjoyed this experience, this tiny taste of the REAL THING, and if the figure behind the glass synchronously copied your every move, however slight these might have been, and also, if at the perceived ‘silliness’ of it all you giggled or laughed and the only audible sounds came from you (nothing reverberated from inside the mirror), then many congratulations, friend, ‘The Speculo Challenge’ might be exactly for you.* 

*When twilight arrives on the day of the challenge, you must simply position yourself in front of the mirror and well, let the games begin, if you will.* 

*At the start, please ensure that enough daylight remains so that you may see yourself clearly. Remember you must resist the temptation to reach for any artificial source of illumination at any point in the cycle of night. Doing so will automatically disqualify you. In any case, it will be unlikely to ever get completely pitch black. Your eyes will adjust to the gloom using whatever degree of moonlight gets into the room.*  *You can leave the curtains open all night if you prefer. Do not worry about prying eyes. You have bigger fish to fry, friend!*  *You just need to keep looking at yourself in the mirror. And keep looking……*

*Once started, it should be relatively easy for the first few minutes, but shortly thereafter you should begin to experience a sense of unease, of discomfort, from looking at your reflection for a significant length of time.* *This is mostly due to “semantic satiation”. This is the process whereby continued exposure tends to rob any stimulus of its power. If, for example, you constantly repeat to yourself the same word over and over and over and again and again and again over a significant time period, this will reduce the word it to its component phonetics, mere sounds entirely disassociated from any prior meaning.*  *(You might want to try this yourself, just for fun. We recommend that you loudly repeat ad nauseum the following word….DEATH.)* 

*In a similar manner, looking at yourself in a mirror for any extended length of time, much longer that it feels comfortable to do so, will have the effect of rendering your face gradually unrecognisable. The features will retain a level of familiarity. Those are still your eyes, after all, and that is your mouth, surely it must be.* *But do you really look like that? If your life depended on it, would you be prepared to swear to a higher power that the face you are looking at in the mirror belongs to you, and not to someone or something…..else?*

*The other source of unease will come with the realisation that you now have a long stretch of time ahead of you with (mostly) only your own thoughts for company.* *As it slowly gets darker, you will indeed have plenty of time to think, but in a STRANGE ALIGNMENT of internal mood and external light, you will find that as it gets darker, so too will your thoughts. This is unavoidable and trying to resist it will only worsen the symptoms. It is much better to just accept the situation.*

*You might also be unable to avoid the squirm-inducing sense that someone is looking at you. This feeling, once it latches onto you, will not leave you for the rest of the night.* 

*It’s not going to be easy….*

*There will come a time when you find it hard to look your reflection in the eye. You will begin to feel inferior, weaker, unworthy of meeting its much bolder gaze. But you must keep looking!*

*You might even feel a temporary sense of relief when the night-time arrives and shadows begin to crawl over the surface of the mirror-you’s ghastly face and begin to obscure its pathetic features. This relief will be misplaced because you will soon realise that few things are scarier than looking at your own face in the mirror in the dark.* *There is something so intrinsically disturbing about doing this……....and therein lies the challenge, friend.*

*Eventually, In the near pitch-black your mind will inevitably work to impose features onto the dark oval shadowy canvas that has become the not-you-but-almost-you’s face. This is not abnormal, it is merely brain business, what the neuronal circuitry of the sentient lump in your head is designed to do.* *It is the reason why you so often see faces in the clouds in the sky or in the folds of a curtain or cracks in the ceiling or even in a bowl of cereal flakes. So what if all the faces you see or think you see that night, superimposed onto your dark reflection, are grotesqueries and deformities from your wildest nightmares? That is just the way the cookie crumbles!* 

*It will be very hard to keep looking at that almost featureless dark-shadow version of yourself. You must show resilience. You may also begin to see things out of the corners of your eyes, but rest assured that at this stage of the night these are just illusory figments which can be safely ignored. Please persevere. The challenge requires that you keep your eyes resolutely trained on the dark-you in the mirror.*

*And very soon even the fear you feel from gazing into that dark face will abate a little, but your mind will continue to race. You see, friend, during the hours of daylight and any artificially illuminated night-time hours, your consciousness is protected from itself, from an unsparing looking inwards and examination of the true unadorned nature of your failed existence, by a never-ending barrage of external stimuli. Once these have been removed your unprotected psyche is ready to be assailed and flayed by your innermost, darkest, most intimate thoughts. During this stage of the night, you will have only yourself to fear, and that, for many, will be enough. Many will indeed drop out of the challenge during this stage, and they will only have themselves to blame!*

*For those who remain (and we sincerely hope that you will be able to linger - along with your stench, perhaps, no?), time in the darkness may begin to….misbehave, to stretch out inordinately so that minutes will feel like hours, hours like days. (Also possible is that the time will fly and that before you know it, it will start to become a little bit lighter inside the room. Ha! You should be so lucky!)*

*The following thought will likely cross your mind as you sit for so long and oh-so-alone in the dark. How truly strange it is that you are alive right now… and that you are still alive now, still alive now, and still alive, still alive, still alive….your continued existence predicated on these low level electrical charges continuing to be sent from that carnal lump in your head to that carnal pump in your chest, those tiny ethereal pulses that are barely even there and that would incessantly keep your heart beating when it would be so much easier, so much more probable, that they would not.* *Place your hand on your chest or put fingers to your neck, feel your pulse, tune in to this miracle of suspended mortal disbelief, listen to your very own heart as it continues to beat on, drone on, even after so many years, improbably without missing more than the occasional beat. In the absolute quietude it should be easy to feel and hear that life-giving drumbeat. (Even if you live by a busy main road with heavy nightly traffic, tonight the silence will be total). Listen to that throbbing thud-thud of your heart, thud-thud, thud-thud, thud-thud even as it speeds up, as it threatens to become deafening, keep listening, keep tuning into that frequency, merge with it….thud-thud, thud-thud, da-dum, da-dum, DA-DUM, DA-DUM, DA-DUM!, DA-DUM!!…..* *Do not think of the word STOP.* 

*Several hours into the challenge, in plain night, you will begin to experience successive waves of ABSOLUTE PANIC rushing your body, crushing your mind, taking your breath and temporarily driving you completely INSANE WITH FEAR. Each wave should last around a minute (although it might feel interminable, literally so if you are one of the very unfortunate folk whose luck runs out early during ‘The Speculo Challenge’) and they will arrive at irregular, completely unpredictable intervals over the following sixty minutes or so. It is difficult to give you advice about how best to deal with this experience. Bracing yourself will not help and indeed, it might ONLY SERVE to make things worse.* 

*Moreover, be advised that there will be no habituation to this experience, no law of diminishing returns. In other words, the panic level will not abate throughout successive repetitions of the event. You simply must endure this stage of the challenge.* *If you really must know, know that the OVERWHELMING TERROR you experience will be precisely the kind felt by those poor airline passengers, trapped on a broken plane which is plummeting earthbound and out-of-control, during those final seconds before their* *very beings are obliterated in a fiery crash. Imagine the faces of these poor unfortunates as they look around at each other in WILD MORTAL TERROR. What would those faces really look like? Their eyes? Their mouths? It is a truly awful thing to mentally envisage and your brain would normally resist that. Of course, you will not need to imagine. You can just look in the mirror.*

*The next stage will be one of the most difficult to navigate sanely, but you must keep the faith. Earlier you will have experienced significant unease and psychological malaise and even periods of downright panic, but what comes next will take it to another level.* *Sadly, this is where most people, the weaker ones unblessed with the necessary steadfast resolve, will give up on ‘The Speculo Challenge’ and return unenlightened to their mundane existences. They will never know.*

*As the light fades further and it becomes difficult to discern the figure in the mirror, some visually disturbing scenarios may well emerge.* *Under normal circumstances, when you see yourself in a mirror you will always see yourself flipped or reversed from left to right, your right hand is your mirror-image’s left hand, and so on.*  *But tonight, during the challenge,*  *you might notice that whenever you make a movement on your side of the mirror, your mirror-image will copy your moves exactly, so that if you lift up your right hand , your mirror-image will also lift up their right hand (from the mirror-image’s own perspective, so diagonally across from you) and not their left hand as one would ordinarily expect.* 

*In another potential scenario, the normal left-right reversal persists, but the strangeness derives from a different source. Here you may find that any move you make on your side of the mirror is replicated by your mirror image in advance by a few milliseconds.* *No matter how fast your movements are, how unpredictable or unplanned, it will always seem as if this other-you gets there first, by a tiny but perceptible margin.* *As uncanny as this perceived effect will be, worse perhaps will be your experience of uncertainty as to which side of the mirror you are on, and as a corollary, whether you are the originator of the movements or a mere puppet, literally forced to go through the motions.*

*If you get this far you are doing very, very well, friend.*

*In the middle of the night, during the time of peak darkness, is usually when the figure behind the glass will finally deign to speak. It is vitally important that you try not to listen.* *Clamping your hands over your ears will not diminish the sound of its voice but you must mentally detach yourself from what you hear in order to rob the spoken words of any import. Although the voice may sound like your own but not quite, its tone susurrant and reassuring, intended to calm your jangled nerves, every word that comes out of its jagged mouth will be a lie and should not be believed. It will only lie to you. Do not listen when it tells you that everything is okay, that you will be fine.*

*Everythingisokayyouwillbefine….everythingisokayyouwillbefine….everythingisokayyouwillbefine……*

*It is also quite possible that this almost-you will adopt a different tactic and instead remind you that in actual fact, no, you have never been okay, you have never been fine. You should believe these words if you think that they are true, but equally, if you have deluded yourself into thinking that they are not.* 

*The figure behind the glass, that awful other-you may then segue into talking about other things. It might fill your head with the truest and darkest secrets of the universe, or it might tell you a knock-knock joke. If it is the latter, do not play along.* 

*Knock, knock….*

*Who’s there?* 

*Me.*

*Me who?*

*Me, you.*

*There may come a point when you realise, to your utmost surprise, that the figure behind the glass has been silent for some time and that you yourself have taken over the talking, the laughing, the crying, the screaming….*

*Finally, all being well, it should begin to get a little bit lighter inside the room. (Or possibly not. If you find that the dawn never comes, this will confirm that you are one of the very unfortunate souls whose luck has indeed run out early during ‘The Speculo Challenge’. For you, ‘The Speculo Challenge’ will never end.)*

*For the ones whose luck manages to hold out, those promising candidates who may already be on their way to a magnificent success in ‘The Speculo Challenge’, a strange eventuality may transpire. You might notice that it gets lighter quicker in the view inside the mirror than in the actual room.* *Dawn will arrive earlier in the mirror-world than in the ‘real’ world.* *This will allow the candidate a clearer view of the things that will INEVITABLY HAPPEN to their poor dear mirror-self.*

*This is the moment when things might get rather disturbing. We advise that you adopt a sense of detachment from what you will see and hear. You might want to repeat the following mantra to yourself “It’s not real…it’s not real…’’, but do not do it so often that the words lose their meaning. Or maybe you could try and rationalise the situation by thinking you must have fallen asleep and are merely dreaming right now. Yes, yes, that might be the best thing to tell yourself at this point.*

*If you close your eyes, you will still be able to see...*

*What one sees in the mirror next will vary from person to person and no two candidates will share the same experience. However, as a rough guide to what you might expect, we will provide you with just one example of what might lie in store for you.* *(In all honesty, ‘The Speculo Challenge’ will target one’s particular deepest fears, so what you will personally experience will feel even more raw and acutely frightening than anything suggested by the example below.* *It is important to bear this in mind before you decide to TAKE THE PLUNGE.)*

*In this example scenario, the following events occur. You hear the doorbell ring from inside the mirror world. The sound is tinny, muted, emanating from behind glass. (If you also hear the doorbell ring in this/your/’real’ world, on no account must you get up and answer it! We implore you to remain seated.) After the doorbell rings a second time, you must observe attentively as the mirror-you gets up and goes to answer the door, disappearing temporarily from view. The mirror-you will return seconds or minutes or hours later accompanied by a tall figure carrying an axe and wearing a red hooded robe. The tall man’s face remains tantalisingly out of view for the most part, but when you do catch a glimpse of his profile, the features will be deformed and grotesque, as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. When he speaks his voice will sound eerily familiar, but you will never be able to pinpoint where you heard it before. That is just the way it is.* 

*Your mirror-self will exchange a few words with the tall man in the red robe, words that will be mostly unintelligible but which will nevertheless impart a palpable sense that they are dripping in evil. Then your mirror-self in the mirror world will stand up and casually approach the mirror frame and, as it if it were the most natural thing in the world, they will stick their head out through the glass and into this/your/’real’ world, and then they will crouch or kneel down and place their neck against the bottom edge of the mirror. The tall man in the hooded robe will then swing his axe, and well, you can imagine the rest…. A word of advice though, do not glance down even for a second at the decapitated head as it rolls onto your feet, even as it begins nipping at your heels, and especially if it also begins whispering to you that everything will be okay, that you will be fine.* *Most importantly, no matter how strong the impulse, and it may be almost IRRESISTIBLE, you must absolutely control the urge to replicate your mirror-self’s action of kneeling down and magically sticking your own head through the glass and into the mirror-world, where the tall man with the wrong face wearing the red hooded robe awaits, bloodied axe in hand.*

*When daybreak finally arrives and envelops the room in its light embrace, you will notice two things.*

*1)* *You should still be able to recognise the face of the person behind the glass, but the person behind the face will forever remain an unknowable mystery.*

*2)* *You have not taken a breath in the last hour or so, nor have you needed to.*

*What is left for us to say? If you have managed to get to this point, it means that you have successfully completed ‘The Speculo Challenge’, against all the odds! Soon you may forget that you ever did the challenge, of course, but the feeling of being a BIG SUCCESS will never abate. You may now stand and go about your business, not the moronordinary business of the everydayers, but the business that has been specifically ordained for you and your new existence. (If you live with others, we presume your fellow dwellers will join you shortly in the conduct of your morning rituals. It is important that they remain clueless about what has happened to you and what your plans are. You must behave and speak as if you are still one of them. You must tell them that you are okay, that you are fine. You will find that you can lie effortlessly, not only because you are now truly spectacular, but because you realise now that you have always been lying.* *If they ask you how ‘The Speculo Challenge’ went, you should tell them that you fell asleep and that you dreamt about a man with an axe and you should let them all laugh about it. And maybe remind them about it again that night, so they can laugh about it once more, just before they go to sleep for the very last time.)*

*And after that? Well, the world is truly yours now and you can do whatever you want. Who would have the power to stop you?* *You actually did it!* *You completed ‘The Speculo Challenge’!* 

*Congratulations, fiend. You are no longer human*. 

\----------------------------------------

That’s it, that’s where it ends. It’s just mad, right? Speculo means mirror in Latin, in case you were thinking of googling it. And, btw, that’s not a spelling mistake in the penultimate sentence, I triple-checked that. It definitely says ‘fiend’.

I actually tried the minute-long version of the challenge, the ‘taster exercise’ they called it, and that felt so weird. Not sure if you tried it yourself when you came to that part of the letter, I hope you did, and if you did, you’ll know what I mean. It’s just too damn creepy, right? Even just twenty seconds in, it starts to feel…wrong. And you could say I succeeded at that shorter version, in the sense that, well, nothing majorly strange happened. (Full disclaimer: I finished the minute-long version of the challenge only on my second attempt. The first time I tried it, about halfway through, our cat came into the bathroom and started hissing at me and I had to shoo it away, close the bathroom door and start again). 

I’ve asked around my neighbourhood if anyone has received a letter like this one and they all said no (unless they’re lying about it?) So why me? Is it just random bad luck, some nutter playing games who just happened to pick my door? Is it someone I know who wants to prank me? I know for sure I’m not going to try the full version of ‘The Speculo Challenge’ (would anyone really have the guts to stare at themselves in a mirror, in the dark, for the whole night?). But can I just simply forget about it? Not sure if I can, to be honest. 

So what do you think, friends?

**Edit**: I was going to leave the post above exactly as it is but then I decided to try something else and tell you about it. It sounds silly, but I thought that maybe if I wrote out the letter myself, not type it all up like I’ve done for you, but actually wrote it all out by hand, on white, unlined paper using a red ballpoint pen, if I wrote it in exactly the same way as the original writer, it might get me closer to their mindset and might give me a clue about where it came from. A bit crazy, I know, but I just felt instinctively that it would be useful to do that. So, with nothing to stop me, I went right ahead and I did it.

I waited till my wife and daughter had climbed the stairs and gone to bed. After I said goodbye to them I came back down and sat at the kitchen table, and I started copying out the letter by hand, working like a man possessed, and it took me a few hours, but I finally finished it, about ten minutes ago, and it wasn’t until I had finished writing down the entire bloody thing that I looked at my red-stained fingers, tightly clutching the red pen, and realised only then that I had written it all down,  every last word, using my left hand.

I have always been right-handed.
