If you know what Hornflowers are, you’ve probably eaten a petal or two. Apparently it’s common to do if you were raised in the few areas they grow. They’re bright white and flourish in cold, wooded climates in the Midwest and parts of Canada. I’m writing all of this to warn you, though: if you ever see a red flower that looks anything like a Hornflower, run away as fast and as far as you can. And if it was anywhere near home, check on your loved ones before it’s too late. 

All I’m going to say about myself is that I’m a college junior, and I attend college in the Midwest. Over my winter break I went up to northern Minnesota to visit my cousin Kate, who had been one of my best friends growing up until her family moved away when we started high school. They lived in a small town about an hour’s drive from Lake Superior, tucked away in the middle of the woods. It was a quiet life for them, especially so after my aunt got sick and died in 2020. My uncle put up the act that he was moving past the grief, but Kate had told me his life spiraled downward since, and he was never the same after losing her. 

Kate and I were planning on hanging out with some of her friends in their house, since my uncle had gone off to some sort of retreat and she had it to herself while he was gone. When I finally pulled into town that night there was already a party underway, so as soon as I walked in they’d put a beer in my right hand and an energy drink in my left. 

She introduced me to her friends, and the party got started in full swing. After a few hours I found myself sitting with Sean, a close, drunk and outgoing friend of hers who I’d hit it off with well. 

“I can get down with a city, but have you ever gone drinking in the woods?” Sean asked, as halfway into our conversation his words had begun to slur. 
I gave him a look - it didn’t sound nearly as fun as his buzzed excitement made it sound. 

“No, man, my family lives out in the fields. I think there are like three trees you can see from our house.” Sean snorted at this. 

“Bro it’s better than it sounds. Plus if I’m right,” he tilted dangerously far back in his chair, craning to see out the window, “I think we have the lights out tonight! That’ll sell you on the North.”

Sean, who had clearly had more to drink than I could catch up to, was fighting a losing battle to compare my college town with rural Minnesota after failing to do so with sports. 

“Hey Kate! Lights out for the lights out!” He shouted across the room. My cousin ran to the window to look.

“Oh my god, look at them! It’s only 20 out, who wants to go out and see?” Kate’s eyes glowed with excitement. Impressive as the spectacle was, the windows of the house only offered glances at the aurora through the dead forest ahead. 

The decision to go out was unanimous, so we put our winter coats on and opened the door. The gust of wind that hit us was immediately sobering, reminding us how far north we were. Whatever the actual temperature was, the frigid air crashing into our exposed faces and ears felt like we were walking through barbed wire. 

After a brief walk through the forest, I rethought my cynicism. The lights overhead were stunning, as if we’d walked into a watercolor with the painter still adding strokes of green, blue, yellow and orange endlessly overhead. They rippled through the clear, starry night, waving and weaving through the expanse of the sky.  As nonsensical as most of my conversation with Sean had been, I had to admit the view truly was awe inspiring. 

I don’t remember how long we stayed in that clearing, but at some point everyone had gone back to the house but Kate, Sean and I. We’d finished our beers and the trees weren’t sheltering us from the air, so we turned to go back and rejoin the party. Four steps into our return trip Sean stopped us. 

“Kate check this out! It’s like a strawberry Hornflower!”

Kate looked where he was pointing and stepped forward to take a look at the dark red plant. 

“No shit! It looks just like one. Want to give it a try?”

I looked blankly at the two of them until Kate turned and saw my confusion. 

“You know how you can chew some plants for a buzz of energy?”

I nodded, and she briskly nodded back with a smile. 

“It’s like that, but it’s more buzz and less energy. Normally they’re white, but we used to chew these all the time in high school, just don’t have more than one or-” she shifted her voice to accompany her reference and pointed two finger guns at me, “you’re gonna have a bad time.”

Sean chuckled, crouching by Kate to examine the flower as she was talking. They each pulled a petal, before turning to me. I looked at Kate, who smiled and shrugged. 

“It’s just a plant. Want one?”

Being the only one of the three of us with a college reputation to live up to, I didn’t want to be the only one bringing the party down. I took a petal and put it in my mouth as we walked. 

The taste wasn’t memorable. Imagine eating any other flower petal and you’ve probably got the idea of its flavor. As Kate and Sean neared the edge of the woods I told them to go along and I’d meet them inside. Sean stuck his arm out with a thumbs-up, and Kate shouted back to me, "Don't kill our damn trees!”

As I went about my business in the forest I looked back to catch one more view of the aurora, but pinkish grey clouds had moved in quickly and swallowed it back up. 
When I came back around the front of the house I was surprised and annoyed to see that the party appeared to have ended. The lights had all been turned out, and each window was a still, black frame. A quick scan of the car-filled driveway however led me to believe that they were preparing for a drunken prank, so I rolled my eyes, cracked a smile and opened the door. 

This was the first sign that something was terribly wrong. The smells of warm beer and pizza and the palpable energy of the party had been erased. In their place was a darkness so thick that the lights couldn’t manage to reach the corners of the room, and a silence so deep I startled myself with the soft sound of my wet rubber shoe on the linoleum floor. I stood for a moment in a confused, numb, uncomfortable stupor. My head turned right and left, seeing only murky darkness barely broken my the light over my head, reminiscent of looking up at the fading moon from deep underwater.
 
“Kate?”

My voice would have been lost in the wind outside, but inside the void of the house it battered my ears. 

“Kate come on, let the good times roll!”

Silence. 

“Sean?”

As my voice was still grating on my ears I heard movement downstairs, like jeans rustling as someone took a small step. I had no desire to step into the ominous shadows, but the railing to the stairs was three short steps away to my right. I slowly walked over and looked straight down to see an abyss yawning back up at me.
 
“Kate, you down there?”

“Why are you here?”

I froze in place. The voice wasn’t Kate’s. It was my Uncle’s. 

“Uncle Matt, is that you?”

A pause. 

“Come down and show me your face.”

I recognized the voice as clear as day, but the tone was alien. At the words’ surface was tiredness, fatigue and weakness, with a sense of hopelessness hanging over them. But lurking under the surface I could sense deep, unseen malice, a controlling force I couldn’t imagine coming from the uncle I knew. There was no trace of familial warmth, or even a recognition of who I was. 

I walked around the staircase, my hand gripping the rail as if I may drown without it. Without removing my hand I reached to the nearby wall, quickly flipping the light switch for the room ahead. The lights came on immediately, but like spotlights on a dark stage they did nothing to brighten the room.  Each step showed nothing more below me, as I saw the murkiness of the lower level unfold. It wasn’t until I stopped at the top of the staircase I could finally see a trace of light coming through the basement’s glass door, though it looked as afraid to pierce the shadows as I was. 

Against that small pool of light I could see the outline of a man, wavering slightly back and forth as he faced me. Straining my eyes as hard as I could, his features remained completely hidden. I tried to pull my phone from my pocket furtively, ice running through my veins and numbing my fingers as they probed for a light. 

“Is that you Uncle Matt?”

“You don’t belong here.” The voice again was sickly, but ominous. 

“I’m here with Kate, she just came back a minute ahead of me. Where is she?”

I said this as I finally managed to retrieve my phone, but its frail light reached less than halfway down the stairs before it was swallowed. 

“Kate isn’t here yet. I need to bring Monica home first.”  The name chilled me more than the darkness had. Monica had been my aunt’s name. 

I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could my uncle took a step toward the stairs, then slowly another, shifting his weight each time as if he needed a cane but had none. 

“I don’t want you here. I’ve built this house for my family. You get out!” 
His voice, still strained, was gaining more volume and more force with each word. I took a slow step back as he stepped onto the staircase. 

“Uncle Matt I’m sorry, I was-“

“Go!” 

As he raised his voice, I felt something imperceptible lurking within it. I didn’t register anger, fear or frustration beneath the words, but felt something deep, primal and malevolent; an ancient, unnamed leviathan stirring just below me as I tread water over the deep. My legs gave out as I stepped back, struck by the same weakness I would feel running from nightmares in my sleep. By the time I was able to stand his head was surfacing from the floor like a shark cresting water as he neared the top of the stairs. My flashlight still on in my hand, I spun it to face him as I prepared to run. 

He was just my uncle. He wasn’t bloody, deformed or monstrous. He wore deep bags under his eyes from sleepless nights and skipped meals, and his face looked paler and more weathered than I expected. But underneath the skin and behind his eyes, the man was gone. There was an emptiness, a sense of the desolation that comes when even decay had finished its work. From within those dark eyes I could perceive a deep determination - but for what I couldn’t imagine. 

He stood mere feet away from me at the top of the stairs, his meager frame decorated with shadows by the sickly lights overhead. 

“Uncle Matt I will leave, I promise,” I fumbled, “I didn’t know you were here.” He silenced me with a slowly raised hand. 

“You’ll leave because I’ll make you leave.” He said, his voice monotone and cold. “It’s going to be just the three of us here. Nobody else.”

I nodded, steadying myself with my hands as I stood on shaking legs.
 
“I am so sorry…” I apologized, my voice trailing as I remained frozen in place. A strange smile played at the corner of his mouth. 

“Hey son,” he said quietly, “you still afraid of spiders?”

I had shared my fear with him several times in the past. I blinked, confused at the sudden question. As my mind raced, I heard a sound in the hallway next to me like heavy rain falling rhythmically on glass. Turning my head and straining my eyes against the dark, I saw to my horror eight gently glowing beads of light begin to emerge. Slowly a spider the size of a dog stretched itself into the light, patches of brown hair sticking out of its long, exoskeletal legs. For a moment I stared in speechless terror, looking from its eyes to my uncle’s and realizing they shared the same look. 

Catching myself before my knees gave again, I heard the same heavy scuttling coming up the stairs while the first spider approached, bringing its thick front legs and needly fangs up in the air nearly to my height. Finally my adrenaline overcame my shock and I stumbled into a run, just as I heard an airy hiss escape the gaping hole beneath its fangs. 

“Don’t you ever come back here.” My uncle’s tone hadn’t shifted even a beat as he’d spoken, the same malicious indifference striking at me with each word as I fled toward the front door. 

I threw the door open and jumped down the stairs in front of the house, stumbling into the snow face first before scrambling back up. As I sprinted away I turned my head to look behind me. Nothing had chased me out of the house. I dropped to me knees as nausea overwhelmed me. The moment before my head was forced down by sickness I saw the door close and the faint, weak light inside go out, leaving the house lifeless and colorless, aside from the red flowers beginning to cut through the snow’s surface in front.  

The terror I felt numbed me to the cold. Once my stomach was painfully empty I stood again, looking back toward the small Main Street of the town in the near distance. Though I couldn’t even begin to understand what had just happened, I felt glad at least that wherever Kate was, she wasn’t in the house. I pulled my phone back out, but just as I’d dreaded I didn’t have any service. I turned the flashlight out and moved on. 

The Main Street had its own horrible feeling. Both the snow and the sky reflected an odd, reddish tint to one another. Weedy roots could be seen under the snow on the sidewalk and at the bottom of the buildings, with those same red Hornflowers growing by the buildings, ominously mocking the frozen winter soil they were planted in. As I walked I quickly noticed a building ahead of me, the roots ominously crawling like vines up the sides but mercifully fully lit from the inside. I broke into a jog, then a sprint toward it, gulping back the new wave of emotion suddenly welling inside me. 
I burst through the doors, drawing a listless glance from the old man sitting at his desk along the wall. I raised my head to shout out for the help I needed, before I noticed the rows and rows of books and thought better of raising my voice.  Before I made it to him I heard a familiar voice.

“Oh my god, oh my god… I can’t believe you’re all right!”

I’d never heard a voice sound like music, and I will never again hear music that sounded like that voice. I turned to see Kate walking briskly toward me, her body language showing she had no better a journey here than I’d had. 

After we hugged each other tightly we both started speaking at once, before pausing with relieved smiles. Wordlessly Kate tilted her head back, and I followed her between the books to a long, wooden table. We sat across from each other, dust hanging in the air between us.  

“Kate where the hell did you go?”

“I went into the house! Sean was right behind me, but I swear the second I walked through the door he was gone.”

“Gone?”

“Yeah gone like… like Thanos snap gone.”

Kate’s shaky smile and watery eyes let me know that was the best attempt at humor she could muster, and I smiled back weakly to let her know it was a good try.

“He just disappeared? What, did Scotty beam him up?”

She nodded, the beginning of a smile coming and going again. 

“I walked in and everything was just empty. Even the damn furniture, just completely vacant. I turned the lights on and they barely did anything. I was freaked the hell out so then I went to the kitchen to turn the lights on to see if that would be any better, but then when I did the lights went out by the door.”

Kate went on. She’d been trapped in a tiny island of light in her kitchen, when she started hearing whispering voices coming from the shadows surrounding her. She swore she could see something moving all around her, but couldn’t make out anything about it. Eventually she began to see the shadows crawling slowly toward her - taking over the light in the kitchen as the whispering grew louder. Not knowing what to do she’d broken out the window in the kitchen and jumped, which at that part of the house had been two stories. 

We sat in silence for a moment before I recounted my story. Her jaw dropped open when I told her the interaction I’d had with her father. 

“There’s no way he’s here. He told me he was going to Ohio for his retreat, and even if he lied about that he’s been gone a whole week!”

“I don’t know. It was his face, he was talking about you and aunt Monica, and-“
Kate’s face darkened at the mention of her mother. She said nothing, but my voice trailed off. After a few silent moments, I volunteered an idea. 

“I’m going to talk to the librarian. Either he needs to know what’s going on or maybe he already does.”

Kate nodded silently, staying seated. 

The librarian looked like a healthy retiree in his mid seventies, with thick, white hair and a clean shave. He wore a starched blue collar under a grey cardigan, and although he was sitting behind his desk my mind registered he must either be in khaki work pants or his weekend corduroys. He sat staring at a book listlessly, not acknowledging me as I approached. 

“Excuse me sir,”

He looked up and smiled thinly. 

“Yes young man, how can I help?”

I considered that I had no idea how to begin without sounding insane. 

“My uncle is injured and I need to call an ambulance, but my cell phone isn’t working. Can you please help me?”

I was proud of my story, until I realized that the amount of time between when I’d entered the library and when I reported the emergency made him as likely to call the police as an ambulance. 

“Of course, I’d be happy to help you.”

I rested my hands on the desk and watched, at a loss, as the man turned to his computer and began typing. Moments later he spun back, smiling, and stood up. 
“It’s right over here, if you’d like to follow me.”

“No, sir, I need you to call an ambulance-“

I stopped and began following him as he gave nothing but a polite “mm-hmm” as an answer. Going back to a row of laminated books the librarian ran his finger over each, until stopping and tapping one. He turned to me and smiled. 

“Right here sir.” 

I looked - it was a children’s book about Emergency Services.

“Thank you, but I need to make a phone call, sir. Do you have a landline I can use? This is an emergency”

I followed him while I said this, as the moment he’d indicated the book he’d started walking back to his desk. 

“What’s the emergency?”

“My uncle is badly injured and I need to call 911.”

“Mmm, that sounds awful. What happened?”

“Sir I need to call them right now, I’m happy to explain later. Can I please use your phone?”

The man’s expression hadn’t changed once from the professional, pleasant yet distant look he’d had at first. 

“You can try if you’d like.”

I sighed with relief. 

“Thank you. Where is it?”

He nodded to his right. I looked, seeing nothing but a bare wall. I turned back to him, but he was once again blankly staring at his book. Looking back once more I walked to the wall, but after scouring the area and finding nothing I gave up, shaking my head as I returned to Kate. 

She was resting her head in her hands as I rounded the bookshelves to our table, but when she looked up her face was determined. 

“What’s the plan?”

“The guy is completely checked out. He’s not going to help at all.”

We both went silent, each wondering if it was worth it to go back outside or to stay in what was at least seemingly a safe place. Kate suddenly winced as she shifted in her chair. 

“My ankle is getting worse. The clinic is a block down, can we see if there’s a splint or wrap for it?”

I looked under the table and could see her ankle swelling through her jeans. As terrible an idea as it seemed to leave, letting her become immobile seemed worse.
“Sure, let’s go. Maybe see if they have curtains too, we can make you a cape for your next jump”.

This brought a grin to her face, as she raised a single fist in the air, looking up at it as if flying. 

“Leaping from tall windows in a single bound!”

I smiled and shook my head. 

As soon as we opened the library doors our unease struck us again, colder than the winter air. It had begun to snow lightly, the flakes falling redder than the sky. The darkness it added was unwelcome, but the low moaning and whispering in the air was worse. We stopped every few steps and held our breath, unsure if the siren’s song came from the wind or the shadows. Each building we passed had an ominous look, with the tendril-like roots stretching upward at the base of their foundations, while the street lights barely kept the shadows restrained in the alleys. Shuffling across the small intersection, we spotted the clinic. Its sign was on, but the light coming from inside didn’t tell us whether it was open or not.
