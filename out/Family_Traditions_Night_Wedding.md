"What's the worst thing that has ever happened to you at a wedding?"

"Oh, there's so many things." I told my new clients. "It's hard to choose."

"Probably comes with the territory." She paused. "But that doesn't make me any less curious." She looked at me and a smile crept across her face. "Oh, come on. Do tell. I promise it won't leave this room."

Honestly, her question sets me up for any easy pitch. It gets the clients to engage, keeping them invested. And, helps them to quickly trust my experience. After all, I've been a wedding planner for over a decade and have seen just about everything. From crying grooms to bridezillas. Hashtags and toe tags. Death at a funeral, I've been to 3 of them. People don't just trust me with their special day, they trusted me with their life. Because on this side of the wedding. It's a mountain. An Everest. And I'm the Sherpa who drags these folks up that lane to retrieve the rock at the top and back down again so they can enjoy a beach 2000 miles away.

I leaned in. "It'd have to be, and I'm going to change their names for privacy. [Jim and Larissa's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13zxeq5/wedding_nightmares_night_wedding/) wedding. That still haunts me to this day."

"Why? What happened?"

"Beautiful venue right? Sprawling. We had the Alps as the background. White wine from Napa, champagne from Champagne. The bride was gorgeous and had this train on her dress that you wouldn't believe. Handspun silk. Catering flown in. The gold sturgeon caviar on artesian chips paired with halved slices of heritage hen eggs in an accompany blue shell were to die for. And get this, 2.3 carats from conflict free diamonds."

"Oh my god. What color was the box?"

"Tiffany's."

She squealed with excitement and looked at her husband, "What happened what happened," she asked repeatedly.

"He was already married."

"No! What! Why? Why would he do that?"

"To a dead girl."

"What?"

"A ghost bride that wouldn't leave him alone."

"I've heard about those! Well, I've read about them. I don't personally know anyone whose had one." She titled her face, the wedding pose that she had been undoubtedly working on for weeks. "A night wedding?"

"Exactly. And it's said the night of their consummation. The first wife was not happy. It's said that the ghost wife came to their suite. Knocking. On. Their. Door."

"No, she didn't! You're lying! What happened?"

"Well I heard from the bellhop how he was making his rounds when he stepped on something wet in the hall. He went to get the wet vac, but when he came back the carpet was already dry. Everything seemed normal to him, that was until he heard screaming coming from Jim and Larissa's room. Except it wasn't any kind of screaming he had ever heard coming from the honey moon suite. Panicking, he ran to get his manager. But when the pair returned with the key. They found the room to be empty. With Jim and Larissa nowhere to be found. Only a small red stain that was till wet on the wall bearing any signs that they were ever there."

"Did they check the security tapes," the groom-to-be asked.

"They did eventually," I let out a long heavy sigh. "But there were no signs of foul play. And none of the employees or other guests saw them leave. Obviously their parents were horrified. But that didn't stop the rumors among some of the wedding goers. That the ghost wife took their bodies and souls, trapping them forever in the wallpaper of room 203."

The future bride asked, "Have you...had experience with night weddings?"

"I have in fact." I took a drink of my tea. "They're mostly symbolic, if not downright traditional, where I'm from. My family, actually, performed many night weddings when I was a little girl. Still do, probably. As I haven't been able to keep in contact with them. Not since my mom and I moved to America when I was about 7 or 8."

"Oh, why the change?"

"I'm not sure. Opportunities most likely."

"So...you sort of grew up around wedding planning?"

"I would say that. Yeah. It's kind of the family business."

She grabbed her fianc√©e's sleeve, and I could practically smell the ink drying on the contract.

While the two engaged excitedly, and the scrapbooks were brought out. My assistant came forward to help them organize the details. Leaving me to zone out for a bit, into my own thoughts. It had been awhile since I reminisced about that life way back when.

I spent my earliest years with my Grandpa and mom. Around the siheyuan-styled home. The long buildings surrounding the courtyard on every side. There were many of us living together back then. Cousins and Aunts, distant relatives even. Since all of the men and boys were either off at war or working in the city. They'd send money home when they could, but our family heavily depended on Grandpa's dowries from night weddings back then. He was a monk. Used to be. Which was why people from all over the countryside would come to our home, practically begging Grandpa to marry their deceased daughter or son, in order to give them and their dead peace.

Grandpa used to be a monk. That was until he met Grandma. He would always tell me about the first time, "I laid eyes on her. It was the day that I realized that I didn't want a loveless life. Nor did I want someone lovely either. As they love everyone. No, when I met your Grandma. I wanted to be married for 1000 years."

I always laughed, "Grandma wasn't lovely? So you're saying she was mean?"

"Mean! Stuck up. Up tight! Oh, she had it all. Her family was wealthy, her father a merchant. And like many well-to-do girls at the time. She was traditionally raised. But she fought it every tooth and nail, see she grew up in their ways, and knew just how to rebel, just enough, that she could still burn beneath the hearth without being smothered. Still, I suppose most men found her difficult to deal with. But to me she was fire, and I couldn't help but me attracted to it like a fly."

"What about you Grandpa?"

"What about me? I was a hapless, lowly monk. With not a coin to my name. Just a boy with a lofty dream to marry a girl. Whatever she saw in me. I still don't quite understand."

"Well, what did she say it was?"

"My determination, I suppose. My undying love, I'd say."

"But you two did fall in love."

"We did. Oh her father was so angry. He disowned her and the two never spoke again. And the monastery, they forced me to choose. Those fools. Couldn't even practice what they preached. Because, you know, the monks in our village believe in enlightenment. And the different paths that can lead to purifying of one's soul to reach it. But those old fools couldn't see it. Though I suppose it's difficult to blame them. To them perfecting one soul was difficult enough. But to reach enlightenment through marriage. A perfect union of two souls? They couldn't even imagine it, much less understand it."

"So what did you do?"

"I chose her of course! I took your Grandma and brought her here. Look at that long house. I built it with my own two hands. The bricks that line the courtyard." He pointed to a mud mound near the kitchen. "Your Grandma baked them in that kiln." He touched the bark on the peach tree beneath the bench where we sat, "We even planted this together in the end."

I laughed, "What do you mean?"

Grandpa brushed one of the leaves lovingly, "I buried your Grandmother under this tree."

\*

"Okay, and you ate from it?!"

I was kicking off my heels as I got into my apartment. Leslie, my assistant was filling me on last minute changes for a different wedding we were wrapping up.

"Yeah, no, I know how it sounds now. But back then we were poor. Really poor. And every time the peaches were ripe enough to get picked, it was like Grandma was still feeding us." I poured myself a tall glass of water before laying myself across the sofa.

"Wow. Okay. Anyways, it looks like we'll have to change the 2 o'clock to three on Saturday."

I was really trying to listen, I was. But it had been a long day and an unfamiliar red dot appeared in my DMs. "Leslise. I'm going to have to call you back."

"What? Now? I still have to..."

"Leslie. You won't believe this but I just got a message from one of my cousins back home."

"Wow. Would you call that fate or what?"

"Leslie."

"Yeah, okay yeah. Got it. I'll just push it on through."

"Thanks love, you're a peach."

She laughed, "Oh gross. Okay. Talk to you tomorrow."

After Leslie hung up, I flipped the screen and opened up the message. It was from my cousin Lily. I hadn't spoken to her in ages. We've messaged here or there through the years, but it had been awhile now. What? 10 or 12 years since we last made contact?

&#x200B;

*Zhu-li! I am so sorry. I don't check this one often! I am so sorry to hear about Auntie passing away! I can't imagine how you must be feeling. We all miss her greatly here. Grandpa most of all. He wishes to see her but cannot due to his health. And has asked me to invite the two of you home. So that Auntie's remains can rest. I've attached an open airline ticket below. It should be good for up to 1 year. If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask.*

*We hope to see all of you soon!*

*love,Lily*

&#x200B;

I glanced at Mom's urn resting on the mantle above the fireplace. The cold porcelain bore no signs, but still I shrugged, "What? I was going to leave you there." She didn't answer. Of course she didn't. "This is better, don't you think?"

\*

In the coming weeks I got my affairs in order. Closed out on not one but two bombshell weddings. And then flew across the Pacific Ocean for the first time in 20 years.

Lily picked me up from the airport, and the two of us drove back to the family home.

"Smaller than you remembered, yeah? Because you were this tiny," Lily squeezed her fingers together, "When you left. Now everything is normal sized. So it appears smaller. But I promise you, there is plenty of room for you here."

We got out of the car, Lily helped me with my roller as she went to go open the two large oval shaped doors to the entryway. When they opened, it was like walking back in the hallways of my old junior high again. A real blast to the past. "Wow," I breathed. "It's just like how I remember it." I walked through the courtyard, my feet almost skipping as if I were a kid again. "It's all perfectly preserved," I placed a hand on the peach tree.

Lily shrugged, "Eh. I never left so it just feels the same to me." She smiled and shouted loudly, "We're home!"

It was common way to announce one's return to a siheyuan. Since it was so big, and inconvenient to greet each person individually. We usually saved the formalities for dinner time when everyone gathered.

"Come on," she goaded me.

I couldn't help but smile as I cupped my hands, "We're home!"

Lily took my arm excitedly, "I bet you've missed this." She led me to the kitchen and I could instantly smell all of the familiar spices and herbs. There were dried peppers hanging on a string from the ceiling that made my mouth wet. Jars of pickled onions and garlic. Bowls filled with star anise and Sichuan peppercorns. And the aroma wafting from the wok was thick and savory.

"What is that," my nose twitched.

"Oh come on. You have to remember this." Lily lifted the wooden lid and the scent of slow boiling beef warmed me in places that I hadn't known were cold. "My famous beef stew. You must be hungry from your flight."

I had eaten before the plane ride. On the plane ride. And again, quickly, after I had landed. Because I don't know? I was embarrassed to be fed by my family? To need to rely on someone? It had been awhile for me, honestly, as Mom and I had mostly been alone back home in the States. "Yeah. I'm starving."

Lily began stirring the pot. "Go," she ushered, "Go to your old room and put your things down. The rice should be ready by then as well. Sorry, this was kind of why I was late earlier. But it'll be worth it. I promise."

I almost didn't want to leave, afraid that if I did. The stew and Lily would disappear when I came back.

It was a silly thought, one married from my exhausted imagination no doubt. So I gripped the handle of my roller and slung my carry-on over my shoulder before dragging my feet into the courtyard.

This place was beautiful.

I could hardly believe it. If they ever decided to rent it out as a venue, I already had a few clients in mind for a destination wedding. I mean. There was so much potential here. And even the food, as local cuisine has been all the rage lately.

Everyone was tired of filet mignon and chicken everywhere they went. No, this year's weddings were all about the experience. Cohesion. It was pointless to have lobster in the mountains. The people wanted deer, or bison, elk if they had it. Bear's been discussed but I've yet to see it on the menu. No more chocolate fountains by the beach. They were replaced with oyster bars and crab towers. Shrimp cocktails in the winter? You might as well throw it out. My clients wanted shaved ice not ice sculptures. Farm to fork, and a taste of the scenery is what I call it. They wanted to pretend they lived where they were getting married so whenever they came back they can pick it back up as if they never left a day behind.

My head was still spinning with ideas as I entered one of the long houses. Everything looked the same. Down to the red lacquer tables and the smell of incense burning somewhere in one of the sitting rooms. I crossed two more hallways before coming to a familiar looking door.

Inside was a flat bed at the back, the sheets had been replaced but I could still tell that it was my old room. I pushed my things hurriedly into a corner so I could go back to get some food. When the table in the center suddenly shifted.

I screamed uncharacteristically and fumbled backwards, rolling my ankle in the process.

Suddenly the familiar surroundings felt foreign as everything spun in circles as I went crashing to the ground. I could hear Mom's urn splitting in two as the delicate porcelain met the unforgiving stone tiles.

I looked up in time to see a kid underneath the table. Looking absolutely mortified at what had happened. He was white as a ghost.

"Hey, ow, it's okay," I rubbed my ankle. "Don't worry. We can clean this up." I tried comforting him. But he wasn't having any of it. "Hey, really. It's okay," I said again in Mandarin. He was staring behind me, straight at the urn. His eyes growing wide with horror. The words, "Don't worry," stuck to the roof of my mouth as I turned around to see what he was looking at, and I swear it, I saw writing in Mom's ashes.

By the time I could gather myself, the door to my room was flung wide open and the boy was gone. I picked myself off the floor and managed to get Mom, well most of her, into a vase I found.

By the time I got back to the kitchen I must have looked like a mess. Semi-covered in ash, my ankle looking swollen. It was no surprise when Lily yelped, "What happened! Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine. I just. Mom's urn fell to the floor."

"Oh no, did you..."

"No, yeah. We're good."

Lily put the back of her hand on my forehead, "You look like you've seen a ghost."

I shook my head, "No. It's nothing. It's just. Well her ashes were on the floor right? And I thought I saw something in them. Like letters or something."

"What?"

"Yeah."

"What did it say?"

I shrugged, "I don't know. But it looked kind of like u, n, j."

"Unj? I don't think I know that English word."

"I don't think that's a word," I told her."

The kitchen was hot as a furnace. Other women I didn't recognize came in and out as we spoke. Giving us polite greetings as we talked. Only one of them stayed. She was pregnant. Her name was Su-wan, my cousin twice removed. She was peeling green beans, "Were there perhaps cracks in the ground? This is an old house you know. The ashes could have slipped between the indentations. Making it appear like an image."

"It looked fine to me," I told them. "I even pulled the block off the floor to brush Mom's ashes into a vase. Oh I hope you don't mind," I added.

Su-wan gave me some cabbage leaves, "I'll find you a nice new urn after lunch," they looked as if they had been soaked in water. She had a similar pair wrapped around her own ankles. "It's a pregnancy trick. It helps with the swelling."

"Thanks," I told her.

"It's ready," Lily called as she brought over plates of food. "Let's eat!"

Su-wan got up slowly, her belly swollen. I pulled out a chair for her, "How much longer?"

"Thank you. Oh, any day now," she rubbed her stomach. "Grandpa's going to be so happy."

"The dad too, right? Where is he anyways?"

"Spirits anyone," Lily uncorked a drinking gourd. "I fermented it myself. It pairs well with this kind of dish."

"No," I said. "I'm still feeling a bit woozy."

"Are you sure," Lily asked. "It'll help with your stomach."

Su-wan pushed a tiny cup forward and was speaking. But I couldn't hear the words she said as Lily began pouring her a drink. She lifted the cup to her lips and finished it. And I swear there was a silent scream in my ear, it was like watching white noise with the sound off.

Lily broke my concentration as she suddenly bolted upright and rushed to the door, "Oh let me help you!" I turned around and saw a woman I recognized as my Aunt Nima pushing a bandaged figure in a wheel chair. He was covered in the wrappings from head to toe, even his hair, but I could still tell who he was by his squared shoulders.

"Grandpa," my voice followed.

Aunt Nima smiled, "Sorry. He can't talk right now. The doctor just gave him some medicine. But he wanted to see you. And I promised I would brim him after the appointment. It was the only way he'd comply."

Grandpa reached out a heavily bandaged hand and held my fingers. It was painful to see him like this. But I was glad when his grip felt strong. "I've missed you," I told him.

Aunt Nima smiled again, "He was telling me how glad he was that you decided to come home." She glanced at Grandpa sadly, "It's quite perfect timing."

Lily laughed and grabbed Grandpa's other hand, "It is perfect timing isn't it? She's also just in time for the night wedding coming up."

Su-wan spoke up from behind us, "And don't forget the ritual!"

"What ritual," I asked.

"The birthing ritual," Lily told me. "To celebrate Su-wan and our cousin Lee-yen."

"I've never been to a birthing ritual," I told them.

Lily looked at me oddly, "Of course you have. We used to have them all the time. Don't you remember?"

I shook my head, "No. Not really."

"Ah, don't worry. It'll all come back to you when you eat the moon cakes."

Aunt Nima smiled a third time, "I have to get him back to his room. He has to rest for the ritual tonight."

I let go of Grandpa's hand and watched as he was wheeled away.

After we finished eating. Lily, myself, Su-wan, and a few other women who joined us began preparing for the birthing ritual. There was so much to prepare but it was nothing I couldn't handle. In fact, it ignited my work ethic and I was proud of myself when a few of my simple suggestions to the prep changes increased our productivity.

I was finishing a stitch on a gray gown when Lily came over and pulled it over my head.

"Hey. what are you doing," I complained.

"Everyone's suppose to wear one," she laughed. "What did you think you were sewing this for?" She grabbed my hand. "Come on! Everything is nearly ready."

We got out into the courtyard, several others followed us outside as we were greeted by a crowd of women in matching gray dresses. The sun was low in the horizon and the sound of drums began thundering. I had been in charge of nearly a hundred weddings before, but had rarely been on this side of the events.

Everyone began dancing as the sun set. Smiling. Shouting. At the full moon as it came out to greet us as we continued dancing for hours.

I was so entranced and drenched in sweat that I almost didn't notice as the crowd had slowly begun to part. The laughing and shouting dying down as a hum came from the others. The hum turned into a steady chant that was barely above a whisper as the crowd parted for Su-wan and another pregnant woman I didn't recognize.

But it didn't matter. As we were all family here. So I kept smiling and chanting along with the others as the pregnant women walked toward the raised platform that had been constructed in the courtyard. They were both smiling and clutching their swollen stomachs as everyone gave way.

And when Grandpa appeared from one of the long houses, the others raised theirs hands silently into the air, twirling theirs wrists. I followed suit and a flood of memories began surging back into me. I really had done this before. Always with the other girls and women. With Grandpa at the head. In order to announce a new family member.

My hands were still in the air, my feet had slowly begun to run in place. Everything moving on its own as my body began to remember these nights as prayed to the moon. Aunt Nima was also wearing a gray dress. She was wheeling Grandpa up the ramp. And we all stopped moving, but our hands were still in the air. As we watched with bated breath for him to stand up. He slowly got out of his chair and walked to the center as we began cheering. The pregnant woman lined up on either side smiled as he slowly began to shake off the bandages on his face.

I gasped when I saw it. But no one else seemed surprised.

As Grandpa revealed his face, I noticed that he didn't look as if he was aged a day. In fact. He looked even younger than I remembered.

And when Su-wan started walking toward the stone altar that was shaped like an upright rocking chair. I closed my eyes and started running back to my room. I didn't need to look to know what was about to happen as the memories began unlocking themselves from my brain. I didn't need to see the knife to know that it was going to go up in the air, and come down. I didn't even need to hear the baby crying. I just needed to get out of there.

I pushed through the other women who were all watching intently. Jumping over an overturned chair as I cross two hallways to my old bedroom. Grabbing my bag as I did so as I scrambled to get my stuff.

"Where are you going," Lily's voice crawled into the room.

I whirled around and saw her standing in the doorway. Her hair was wet and messy on her face. She was still in her gray gown. Panting from all the excitement. Or. From trying to catch up with me.

"S-something came up suddenly," I told her.

Lily took a step into the room and I flinched.

She looked around the room, "You finally remembered. Didn't you?"

I shook my head.

"When you and Auntie ran away from America. It left a lot of burden on us. Trying to help Grandpa recover his dream. Did you know that?"

I shook my head.

"It was quite selfish of you two, to leave so much work for the rest of us." Lily gripped the table between us. "Did you know that?"

I shook my head.

Lily lifted her shirt and revealed 3 long crossing scars that each had deep stitches. One of them still looked fairly fresh. "The rest of us had to make up for it," she snarled at me. Lily pushed the table, causing the vase where I had put Mom's ashes to spill out. Then right before our eyes we watched as letters began forming again. It still didn't make any sense to me but Lily laughed, clutching her eye, "I do know this word." She grabbed the table forcibly and spun it around.

The words unj suddenly spelled run.

I swung my carry-on at Lily, hitting her square in the face as I tried pushing my way to the door. Then it felt as if my soul was being ripped out of my shoulders as I was pulled to the ground by my hair. My fingers tried to wiggle between the crevices of her grasp.

She pulled me upright and slapped me in the face, her teeth baring as saliva spewed from her mouth as she slapped me again. "Do you know what I've been through," she screamed.

My hands blindly stretched out, the smooth tips of my finger's like blind worms across her face. Searching for her eyes. When I felt them rebound in their socket with my thumb. I pushed down until she howled with pain. Lily let me go but I dug my fingers in deeper.

There was blood all over her face as I forced her to the ground. Her body withering as she tried to fight back. I didn't let go until she stopped moving. I could hear others nearby, perhaps looking for us. So I left my things and Lily, and made a run for it.

Sneaking through the long hallways, I could see the courtyard and the platform from the windows. I moved quickly as possible without drawing attention. From here the light flickered from the stage and I could hear Grandpa's voice come through.

"As everyone knows. When your Grandma died I was left broken. And lost. So I threw myself into the scriptures looking for comfort. Hoping to find myself. But I found nothing. The best of me died with her. And my quest for salvation nearly came to an end as I couldn't see fit of this world. That was until I found a scroll that was banned from the teachings. I found a way to bring her back."

Grandpa held up a ceramic buddha. Except its face was desecrated until it was nearly unrecognizable.

"And for years I began taking the souls of the brides and grooms that I wed in order to fill this up." He held up his hand and signed the figure nine twice. "Ninety-nine souls, in order to create one."

He smiled triumphantly.

"Its been many years, and many souls. Though my quest became more difficult when word spread of what I was doing. Causing the dowries to stop coming in. So I was forced to use you. All. My own children. And grandchildren. To bring me back seeds."

The drumming stopped.

"And with Su-wan and Lee-yen's sacrifice tonight. We make ninety-eight."

The crowd of women cheered and howled. Whooped into the night air.

"But we are still one short. But thankfully one has returned to us to complete the circle."

I clutched my stomach. I hadn't started showing yet. And had only recently found out myself. It was only a clump of cells still. But I wasn't going to stick around here any longer and wait for them to take it from me. So I climbed over one of the low walls and found myself on the street, barefoot, I began running. I ran so far that the ground grew wet from my footprints, wet with blood.

I ran until I found myself back near civilization. Running into the first establishment that I could find. A hotel. But I didn't have any money. Nor my phone. A kind woman working the front desk took pity on me and gave me some spare shoes from the locker room. And told me to wait near the bar, that she would go talk to her manager, and see what they could do for the night as the police were stretched thin around this part of the country.

I thanked her and went to the restroom to wash my face, clean up my hair and looked at myself long and hard in the mirror. That was when I decided I was going to make him pay. For all the brides and grooms, for all the dead souls he took and lives he ruined. Even for what he did to Lily and the others.

I would make Grandpa pay.

Except that I didn't know how. Not until I went back to the bar and saw a man sitting there, drinking and slurring his words slightly, who turned to me and said, "[Did you know](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1433l46/old_traditions_for_a_night_wedding/) that in order for me to pass on my Celestial title, I must have an heir?"
