The last winter I saw the old woodcutter it was desperately cold. Snow fell thick and heavy on the ground, smothering everything in a blanket of icy white. One by one the trees around town were felled, and one by one they were burned to stave off the worst of the cold.

Eventually the only trees left belonged to the forest.

The forest was a dark and confusing place. We were all warned as children never to wander into its depths, never to harvest its fallen boughs or take an axe to its shadowy trunks. The paths moved, they said, the further in you got. A strange whisper filled the air, not just the rustling of wind through golden leaves but a low voice almost, though the words were never decipherable. It was understood that the forest was apart in some way. Dangerous.

That winter, however, as families shivered in their cottages in front of dwindling fires, the woodcutter headed to the forest. He took a sled dragged behind him and the sharpest axe in his workshop. The townspeople told him not to go, but not with much conviction - they were all freezing after all, and the promise of wood to burn was too tantalising.

The woodcutter’s first foray saw him venture to the outermost edge of the trees only. A few of us watched him select a young sapling, right at the boundary line between forest and open field. We waited with bated breath as he raised his axe and then swung it whistling through the air with all his strength. We knew the moment the blade touched bark - the whole town did - though we were too far away to see properly. I’ll never forget the sound that tree made as steel ate its way through its young flesh. To call it a scream would be underselling it. The high-pitched screech it made carried through the chill air, reverberating through our town and shaking the glass in our windows. We all cried out as one, in alarm, in terror, clapping our hands to our ears in an attempt to drown out that terrible, hideous noise.

He returned shortly afterwards, the sapling chopped into short logs on his sled. Sap dripped onto the snow in his wake, strangely dark against the white - strangely red. We tried not to think too hard about it as the woodcutter allocated us each a log to burn, and as we gathered around our hearths that night the memory of that scream faded, to be replaced only with the warm comfort of fire.

The woodcutter ventured back into the forest the next day. The sapling had lasted just the one night and the town needed more wood to burn. It was the middle of December with spring nowhere in sight. The town gathered at his door as he prepared to depart, some offering mumbled thanks and words of encouragement, others, like my family, begging him not to go back. He listened to us all but departed anyway. The town was freezing, he explained. He had no choice.

The tree he selected this time was slightly deeper in, and thicker and taller for it. This time nobody watched him work, but we all knew once again when his axe had done its job. The scream…

He returned later that afternoon, his sled piled even higher with wood than the day before. Again he left spatters of sap behind him as he dragged the tree through town. Children kicked fresh snow over the bright red droplets and families queued to claim their allocation of logs.

That tree lasted two nights and then the woodcutter returned to the forest. I watched from my cottage’s front window as he vanished into the darkness, dragging his empty sled behind him. We waited for the trees to scream, but nothing happened. The morning passed and the sun dipped lower in the sky and still there was no sound from the forest, no indication the woodcutter had felled a tree. We gathered at the edge of town, wrapped up tight against the cold, and stared out at the forest, waiting. Eventually the sun set and the moon began to rise in the sky, a thousand distant stars twinkling above us as more snow began to fall, gently at first and then more thickly, driving us back into our homes.

We wondered what the silence meant and why the woodcutter had not yet returned. My father offered that perhaps he had delved deeper into the forest in search of bigger trees trees that would last us the winter, not just a few days. Dark looks were exchanged at the thought of that. We all knew how the forest paths shifted and changed the deeper you delved. If the woodcutter had tried to plumb the very depths of the forest… It did not bear thinking about.

We retired to our beds that night full of uncertainty and fear - fear for the woodcutter and fear for ourselves. Our furniture had long since been burned - even the straw from our mattresses had been sacrificed for just a little bit more warmth.

It was when the moon was at its highest that we heard it. The town was asleep for the most part, but the noise roused us all from our frigid beds. We gathered in the town square, our eyes firmly planted on the dark shape of the forest as it crouched silhouetted against the night sky. We heard it again as we stood there, clutching each other’s trembling fingers and staring wide-eyed into the darkness.

A scream rang through the still night and at first the town rejoiced to hear it. He must have found a good tree, we thought, smiling at each other and imagining all the fires we would light. Then, as the screaming dragged on, the smiles fell from our faces, one by one. Despair rippled among us as we each became aware of why this scream bothered us so. This was a scream unlike those we had become accustomed to. This scream was loud, ragged - deeper than the needle-sharp screeches the young trees had produced.

Twice more we heard it that night, each scream more horrendous, more agonised than the one before it. Twice more we flinched and winced as the night was punctuated with the screams - with the voice - of the woodcutter.

We returned sleeplessly to our homes that night, once the silence seemed to have returned for good. The next morning the woodcutter’s sled was discovered at the edge of the forest, piled high with what appeared to be logs from a distance. The poor townsfolk who ventured out to examine it returned pale and hollow-eyed, dragging the sled behind them with sick determination. The sled dripped red as they pulled it through town, and within it dark shapes were stacked, this one wearing a boot, that one a scrap of overcoat, while from the top protruded an axe, clutched tightly in the severed hand of the woodcutter.
