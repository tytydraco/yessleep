Hello to whoever decides this is worthy of their time. Please understand that I would never put my personal life on the internet, but I am tired of lies. My father has been missing for 5 years and the police have stopped looking and my mother has already moved on, but no. Not me. My mom decided to sell our old house and with me being 24 in my own apartment I could not tell her not to sell. 

I had almost given up hope, but I stumbled across his laptop. He kept a work laptop and a personal one ensuring no files would accidentally get leaked. And now things are different. Let me give you some more context.

My father was a biologist, so he had been going on adventures before I was even born. His favorite thing to do was explore forests. There were so many different organisms to be discovered and he made sure to bring me back something from each trip. The last time I saw him he was leaving for the Hamoka Forest 5 hours from our small city of Dimi. This is the second most deadly forest in the entire country, due to a high number of poisonous creatures lurking within the tree line. 

It takes over two years to be fully vetted and trained, and only a select few will make it that far. My father worked so hard to get this chance and we celebrated once he got the call. I wish we had tried harder to convince him to stay. The week had finally come, and I could not help the sinking feeling I began to have. I felt like something terrible was about to happen. I watched as he packed his suitcase and began loading gear into his car. He saw me watching him with tears.

*“Do not cry, Soph. I will be home in a month.”*

Giving me a soft smile, he pulled me into a bear hug, and I began to cry in his arms. The feeling had overwhelmed me, I could not let him go. Rubbing small circles on my back he began to pull away.

*“Remember I will have a small crew with me. I will be back bearing gifts before you know it. I love you*

*kid.”*

He playfully ruffled my hair and got into his truck.

*“I love you, dad!”*

I screamed as his truck pulled out, my mom quickly joined my side, and we waved him off. The first two weeks of the month were normal. He would facetime us every night and send plenty of pictures during the day. The third week is when things started to change. We began hearing from him less and less, mom said he was just busier towards the end wrapping up research. The morning he was supposed to arrive back home was anything but normal.

 He was dropped off by some strange black van and was not like himself. He felt stiff and cold when I hugged him and mumbled some incoherent words. It felt as if my dad had been replaced by a cold-blooded copy. My mom rushed outside to greet him as well. She ran up to hug him but quickly pulled back. She looked at her husband of 40 years like they had just met.

*“H honey are you okay?”*

She stammered out. I could tell her hands had begun to shake. Finally, a cold malicious voice came from my father's mouth.

*“I will be in my office. Do not disturb me.”*

He pushed past both of us and went into the house. My mom looked at me, her face full of concern.

*“He is tired, Soph. Let us cook him his favorite dinner, I bet that will cheer him up”*

She gave me a wink and a smile, but I saw the terror beneath her façade. He stayed in his office for a full 48 hours and then walked out of our house never to be seen again. I knew something had happened in that forest and I had to go there. I had to know. The program he worked for barely gave us any information, the entire crew from that expedition had disappeared. The company used its large array of resources to cover it all up. The hush money may have been enough for my mom, but not for me.

They refused to tell us about the exact location inside the forest my father had been sent to. They would not even give me a straight answer when I asked what he was even out there looking for. I got the vague ‘a new type of insect’ anytime I asked, and eventually, they stopped answering my calls. The forest was too big to just walk through aimlessly, my only option was to wait and hope he would show up again.

I packed his laptop into my backpack and decided to head back to my apartment. My mom and stepfather were packing up some boxes in the living room. Her face lit up when she saw me.

*“Did you get what you wanted? The rest of your stuff will be boxed up in storage, we will get you an extra key”*

I shook my head and pulled them both into a hug.

*“I am going to head home before the storm rolls in. I love you both”*

*“Love you, Soph”*

I heard in unison as I headed out the door. After the short drive to the city, I pulled into my parking spot. I headed inside and decided to order some takeout and settle in with some much-needed Netflix. I decided to get my laptop set up while I waited for my food, I pulled it out of my backpack only to realize it was my father's. Between the drive and ordering dinner, I had almost forgotten about it. I tried the power button, but it was dead. I decided to charge it in my bedroom and headed into the bathroom to take a quick shower.

About 10 minutes into my shower, I began to hear dinging, thinking my food was here I hopped out of the shower. I quickly located the source of the noise, his laptop. With shaking hands, I quickly guessed his password, once the screen had loaded files began to upload from his iCloud. I began to scroll through smiling at the sweet memories we had shared throughout the years. Once I got to the timestamps closer to his trip and disappearance things began to look weird.

 I scrolled through a few photos of him and his team and a lot of nature that was mind-blowing. So many beautiful specimens living within this forest. The photos began to blur and look warped until there was a video at the end. Clicking it caused my blood to turn cold. The video was of one of his crew members, I could hear my father in the background.

*“Akira turn around”*

The crew member was standing completely still, except for his mouth. His lips were moving too fast, and he was mumbling something.

*“Please we are just here to help. We must get it off you. NOW”*

I hear another crew member yell from behind the camera. Akira stopped mumbling and began to slowly turn. Within an instant, something tall and lanky dropped Akira. It looked as if this thing turned him into a puppet, the gaping hole in the back of his head caused everyone to scream. The camera turned and I realized it was my father trying to escape. The camera abruptly dropped facing up toward the sky, I heard screams and the noise of flesh being ripped apart. The last thing I saw was a stinger coming down to crush the phone.

The banging brought me back into reality.

*“Ma’am are you okay?!”*

*“Ma’am please let me know if you need help!”*

Rushing to the front door I pulled it open. The delivery man looked like a pale ghost.

*“Are you okay? I heard screaming.”*

I shook my head yes.

*“Scary movie”*

I tried to laugh it off and grabbed my food. The look on his face showed me he did not believe that, but he turned to leave. I heard a pinging come from the laptop. No way. It was his find my friends, they could not find his phone but now it showed me his exact location. Hamoka Forest.

**I am coming for you dad.**
