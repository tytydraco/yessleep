 

I don't know how long I've been here, or even where here is. I only have rough idea of when I came here, but I know that it was around a year ago. And I'm stuck here, even now.  
This place is meant to be some kind of forest, but it's dead, sick, and dying all in one. The trees are black and twisted, mutated in the darkness that hangs in the air here. The shrubs by the side of what barely qualifies as a path are dead; silently screaming out at me for death they will never be able to receive, tortured all the while. It’s meant to me night here, a full moon in the sky, but the branches of the trees slink around above me, greedily swallowing up any moonlight for me to see by. My eyes are accustomed to the darkness now.  
At my ankles, roots squirm and try to trip me up, drag me down to their level, where they can hurt me.The air itself whispers horrible things to me. Some lies; some true. All cause me pain. The lower branches of the trees lash out at me, cutting my arms, feasting on the blood. They're covered in scars now.  
I know where I'm going. I know where this path is leading me. I don't want to go there; at the same time I do. I can't make up my mind. That's one of the reasons I'm here. I looked for help with them. I felt bad though, all of my friends became pestered by my questions. It didn't matter what they said, I knew it anyway. They just wanted me gone. I am now.  
I lost all my friends. I left them; I did them a favour. They didn't like me anyway. They hated me, I don't blame them. I hate me too. I gave up trying to get help because I knew I would only make things worse. I didn't tell them. I just wore jumpers, or hoodie, or long sleeved shirts. They never questioned it. They didn't think twice about it. Maybe they do now.  
The path keeps leading me on and on, deeper into this forest. I can even start to see the fork in the path, the next decision I will have to make. The only one I will ever get right. I've thought about it for ages. I didn't know what I'd do. I know now.  
\*"Are you okay, mate" David asks me, worry in his voice.\*  
\*I turn back and look at him. I was going to the bathroom, but he'd get suspicious if I didn't come back out, "Yeah. I'm fine."\*  
\*I'm not fine, but I will be.\*  
\*He.sighs, knowing I won't say any more, "Alex, you can always talk to me. You know that, right?"\*  
\*I nod, but I lie. I can't talk to him. He'll hate me too. I turn around and walk into my room.\*  
I finally reached the fork in the road. I look at the two different paths. On the left, it's much shorter. It ends in a thick, grey wall of fog. I don't know what's after that, but I can guess. The right path is far longer. Far more painful. But I can see the end. Beyond the forest, I can see verdant green fields. I can see a picturesque sky, with perfect fluffy clouds. I'm not swayed though. It ends now.  
\*I'm sitting on my bed. I almost can't comprehend what just happened. I feel faint and fall off my bed with a thump. I hear David jump up and start banging on the door, "Alex! Damn it, Alex, talk [to me](http://to.me/)! Please!"\*  
As I walk into the fog, I place an arm out in front of me first. I feel a strong stinging sensation on my wrist. As I walk in completely, the stinging now becomes utter pain. It hurts so much that I nearly black out. I keep walking though. Nothing can stop me now.  
\*David busts the door open, tears streaming down his face. "I won't let you do this!"\*  
\*Crying, he calls for an ambulance and tells them our address. "Hurry, they're bleeding out!"\*  
\*Then everything goes black.\*  
I feel a great force disperse the fog, leaving me in the forest, yet again. I cry. I was so close to finally leaving. So damn close! I try to control my breathing. Calm down. I'll try again soon. I want this to happen. I'm ready now.  
\*The beeps from the hospital machine ring in my ears, each one mocking my failed attempt. I won't fail next time.\*  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------  
\*After several days, David finally leaves the house, unwillingly. If he doesn't, he gets fired. I promise him I'll be fine. I lie. As soon as he's gone, I run to the bathroom and open the medicine cabinet. I'm sorry.\*  
I walk, once more into the fog. Nothing stops me this time. But, as I do so, I'm made aware of why I shouldn't do this. I'm sorry. There's no way back now.  
\*I write this now. It’s the last thing I'll ever do. Goodbye.\*  
Goodbye...
