My friend Shaun's neighbours own this big forest next to their farm, His neighbours don't mind him going in to the forest once he doesn't go in their farm. Today Shaun invited me And my friends Zack, Carl and Declan. We arrived at around 5:00pm, We played basketball for a while until Zack said that we should go to the forest since it was getting dark and it would be something spooky to do since its almost Halloween. We walked up the long pathway to the forest surrounded by a short electrical fence. Once we reached the entrance to the forest we noticed that the land owner had put up a fence to the entrance. It was electrical but there was a way past it. Shaun and Declan went ahead while Me, Carl and Zack walked in a minute after them. As soon as we entered we couldn't see Shaun or Declan anywhere. Zack and Carl were walking and talking about the weird mushrooms on the ground until we all heard this weird laughter. It was nothing like Shaun or Declan's voice so we knew it wasn't them.   
A second later I see Shaun and Declan run down out of the forest into the pathway to the next forest. I told Zack and Carl and we went on after them. It took us a bit to get out of the forest because Zack got stuck. Once we got out and started walking I noticed Shaun and Declan A little bit behind us, There is no way they could have looped around the entire forest in 5 minutes. As soon as I saw them I got really confused and then pretty scared. Shaun and Declan explained that they just got out of the forest and saw a man in a grey jacket somewhere in or around the forest. We got pretty freaked out so we decided to keep on walking ahead to the next forest. Shaun was talking about an abandoned tree house further ahead in the next forest so that's what we wanted to see next. Once we found the entrance a bunch of cows came over to the edge of the fence next to us and started staring at us. The cows didn't make a sound, They just stared.  
Zack went in first and I followed after him. While everyone was talking I noticed a dark figure at the end of the forest, I told Declan but the dark figure was gone as soon as I looked back. Zack walked into the other entrance and found a white bag with blood in it and a ripped sticker, There was also needles and blood smeared all over the trees. As soon as we noticed it the cows started mooing really loudly. Zack refused to go any further after seeing that and the rest of us agreed that we should get back home. Carl was walking slightly ahead of us and he apparently saw a dark figure in the distance. The whole walk back I felt like I was being watched.
