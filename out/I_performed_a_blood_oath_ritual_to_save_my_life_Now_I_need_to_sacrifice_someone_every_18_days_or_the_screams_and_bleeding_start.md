How did it get to this point? I'm hiding in a damp, dark basement crawl space, trying to remain calm. For days, I've been sneaking around this guest house at night, carving symbols into the walls and making all the preparations the ritual requires. 

  
It's been 18 days, and I have maybe three hours to sacrifice someone, or the horrifying screams start again.

  
A few hours after that, I'll start bleeding from my eyes—an unfortunate side-effect of the blood oath that bound my soul to the demon. From that point, it's a matter of hours before the shrieking and blood get worse, more violent. 

  
Eventually, the echoes of my victims start appearing in the shadows one by one. These ghosts stalk me, trying to drag me away into the night.

••

  
I should start by explaining how I got into this mess in the first place.

  
About a year ago, my doctor informed me I had three months to live. As you can expect, I was devastated. I was young and had so much I wanted to see, do, and accomplish. After the diagnosis, I tried everything:  experimental treatments, cutting-edge alpha-stage drugs. I even tried herbs and crystals. None of it worked.

  
As the weeks wore on, my health began to decline rapidly. I was desperate, obsessed with finding a cure. I spent days scouring the internet, scientific journals, books, anything that might provide a remedy to my death sentence. 

  
That's when I stumbled across it—at the public library of all places—a heavily worn, black leather-bound book. Its cover didn't have a title or picture, just bizarre symbols embroidered with what appeared to be strands of black hair, twisted stems, and twine.

  
§¬∆

  
The book looked worn and ancient. I picked it up. It was impossibly heavy and left me feeling a deep sense of dread. I began flipping through the pages until I stumbled upon a sketch of a person. They're holding a dagger, drawing it from their elbow to their palm, blood streaming from their limb to the sigil below. Behind them, a demon appeared to inhale their soul—a blood oath ritual. It promised to relieve all ailments in exchange for a soul.

  
That night, I performed the ceremony and bound myself to the demon. I don't know what I was expecting from completing the ritual. Maybe I'd feel a tingling sensation, a wave of relief, or a jolt of energy. I assumed it would be a waste of time, but I was desperate. Instead, I felt nothing; if anything, I felt worse.

  
The following week, at my imaging appointment, the doctors ran another battery of tests using CT scans and MRIs. After a couple of hours in the waiting room, the doctor rushed in holding the results; his jaw dropped.

  
"I don't know how to explain this. There is no trace of disease in your body. We can run another battery of tests, but both scans show you're cured." 

  
I sat in disbelief, unsure how to process the news.

  
It saved my life—the blood oath ritual. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. What I didn't learn until later is that there were some severe side effects I couldn't have known about until it was too late. 

  
After 18 days, it starts: The screaming. The blood. The hauntings.

  
••

  
I've prepared the altar and dagger at the abandoned house tucked away in the shadows of the woods. I carefully placed stones on the dirt floor to form a circle around the pentagram I etched deeply into the earth. I set candles at each point, and my deep crimson hooded cloak hangs just behind the altar.

  
This will mark the 17th human sacrifice I've performed since I took that cursed blood oath. I've worked out most of the messy kinks and have it mostly down to a science. Even being overly cautious, the house guests do occasionally wake up. They'll hear the scraping sounds as I etch the symbols into the insides of the walls, or the creaking of floorboards from my footsteps while moving throughout the house in the darkness.

  
Often, they're so scared they won't leave the bed. The surroundings are unfamiliar to the guests, and everyone knows old houses make noises at night. Occasionally, they will jolt out of bed to search the house in the dark, trying to find the source of the scratching noises that suddenly woke them, trying to find *me.*

  
Thankfully, the house guests rarely come down to the basement, but I still take every precaution. I've learned the hard way to carry my blade and have the scars to show for it. Right now, the issue is that time's running out.

  
At the guest house, the host's handwritten welcome letter on the counter says the inbound guest's name is Reiko, and her husband's is Elijah. It's their anniversary weekend.

  
That night, the guests arrived. I found a thicket of trees near the edge of the property to watch them. I've found it's best to study their patterns; this way, I know the best opportunity to sneak in and out of the house unnoticed. Do they leave for dinner? Are they night owls and stay up late, or do they call it a night early? 

  
The next few nights, I'll sneak out of the basement, hide in the shadows, and move through the darkness. As the book instructed, I must carve fresh symbols inside the walls and into the floorboards under their bed while they slept. 

  
I don't know what the symbols represent or what they do to enable the ritual; I just know from experience that the sacrifice won't work if I carve the symbols while they are not home, and doing this during the day is not an option. 

  
The couple must have heard the etching on the third night and abruptly awoke.

  
*"Did you hear that!?"*

  
I froze, listening for movement. After a few moments, I quickly slipped out the back door and hid in the bushes at the edge of the property. Elijah must have heard me leave through the back because he ran out of the house and shouted into the night, *"Who's out there!?"*

  
I stood motionless in the thicket covered in darkness. My heart was beating wildly as Elijah took a few steps closer. His eyes scanned the woods beyond. I'm breathing heavily from running out of the house. The night is still, silent. 

  
*Can he see me?*

  
Elijah paced the yard before finally returning to the house and closing the door. I heard the door lock with a loud *click!* 

  
I can finally exhale.

Tonight I'm in the basement waiting impatiently for the sedative to kick in. Once I stop hearing their muffled chatter and the sounds of footsteps moving across the hardwoods above me, I can finally sneak out of this crawl space, up the stairs, and find wherever they've passed out. 

  
From that point, all that's left is to tie up Reiko and drag her unconscious body to the abandoned house in the woods. Then I'll place her inside the circle in the crypt, repeat the chant from the pages in the book, and plunge the dagger through her heart.  

  
She won't wake up—no pain or suffering. I put enough sedative in that bottle to tranquilize a horse. 

  
That'll keep the horrifying screams out of my head. I won't have to deal with the river of blood flowing out of my eyes, nose, and ears… at least for another 18 days.

  
I quickly look at my phone's lock screen, carefully covering it to prevent the blue light from escaping.

  
Ninety minutes until midnight. Shit. What the hell is taking so long? My anxiety is starting to spike as the minutes hiding here in the dark are slipping away like quicksand. 

  
Finally, after what feels like forever, the rustling and chatter seemed to have quieted down—no time to waste.

  
I began to creep out of the crawl space, my knees scraping against the rough surface of the unfinished basement. The ground feels damp and cold against the palms of my hands. Once out, I can finally stand and cautiously approach the staircase. 

  
In the pitch black basement, all I can see are the silhouettes of the stairs from the sliver of light leaking from under the doorway above. I start cautiously ascending the stairs. 

  
On the third step, a sudden noise breaks the silence.

  
*creeaakk*

  
A wave of dread pours over me. I pause to listen. *Nothing.* Just the deafening sounds of silence. My heart starts to race, and my breathing is shallow and sharp.

  
I take another three steps—another sound, this time louder.

  
*CRRREEEAAAAKKKK!*

  
From beyond the door above the stairs, *"Elijah, did you hear that? That same noise I heard the last two nights! I… I think there's someone else in the house.'*

  
"I'll go check it out. Stay here. Whatever you do, do *not* follow me down there."

  
Shit. Shit. 

  
There's no time to slip back into the crawl space. I quickly retrace my steps and fold myself into the nearest corner, completely exposed. I'm trying to contain my wild, short breath, but my heart is pounding and my nerves are on fire.

  
Breathe.

  
I'm tucked tightly near the floor, wedged between the space where the wall meets the staircase. My only cover is the darkness.

  
The door slowly opens with a deep groan, allowing more light to spill into the room. From the vantage point of the doorway, there's no way Elijah can see me. I hear him toggle the light switch on, off, on—repeating a handful of times—but the bulb won't illuminate. I removed it days ago.

  
"If someone is down there, just know I've called the cops! They're already on the way and will be here any minute."

  
He's bluffing. I hear the fear in his trembling voice. 

  
Suddenly, a loud thud upstairs. Reiko must have finally passed out. I hear Elijah's heavy footsteps on the hardwoods moving from the basement door into the living room.

  
Next, I hear a blood-curdling scream from upstairs, followed by a dragging sound. The footsteps above stop.

  
I pull out my phone again to check the time. The screen illuminates my face—2:30 am. 

  
Shit. Shit. Shit.

  
Just as I'm about to slip my phone back into my pocket, a drop of crimson splashes onto the screen, followed by another. Then another. 

  
*No. No. Not this. It's too soon.*

  
I quickly wipe my face with my forearm and look down—a thick smear of blood running from my elbow to my hand. I no longer have the luxury of sneaking around in the dark. I need to take Reiko now, before this gets even worse. But first, I'll have to dispatch Elijah quickly.

  
I rush up the stairs and run into the living room with my knife ready to bite. To my shock, I see Reiko in the corner, her head raised to the ceiling, mouth gaping open. Her arms are limp, dangling by her sides. She has blood streaming down her face. A shadowy figure is behind her, reaching inside her body. 

  
Just in front of Reiko is Elijah. His body crumpled into a pile of flesh, limbs intersecting and folding at unnatural angles. Bones are protruding from his limbs, and a large pool of blood is soaking into the floor.

  
The creature suddenly drops Reiko, her body falling limp to the floor below as it crawls across the floor—its stark white eyes fixed on mine. It opens its mouth unnaturally wide and lets out a deafening scream. 

  
As it closes the distance, my body feels frozen in terror. My heart is hammering in my chest.

  
Run.

  
Somehow, I narrowly managed to escape out the back door. I ran as fast as I could through the woods, branches grasping at my face. 

  
Finally, I reached the abandoned house in the woods and swung the door open. The screams are getting louder, more prominent. The blood is flowing out of my eyes, ears, and nose, drenching my clothes. 

  
Before closing the door, I pause briefly to look into the darkness and see the creature not far behind. I shut the door and snapped the deadbolt before hiding in the shadows.

  
••

  
If you're reading this note attached to the black book by the altar, it's too late. 

  
I'm standing right behind you, in the dark, desperate for a sacrifice.
