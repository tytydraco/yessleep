 I had lived in the same small, rundown trailer park since birth. It was rampant with drugs and shady characters. The most popular drink and drug of choice at the time were heroin and beer. When I was eight, my mom married a man named Paul. Paul had been in a pretty bad car accident shortly before meeting my mom and was prescribed oxycodone for the pain. He quickly got hooked. Soon after, the authorities began cracking down on over-prescription of opioids, and Paul was no longer able to legally get his fix. He turned to the streets, and at $30+ a pill, he had to find something else. He eventually graduated to injecting heroin.

Paul had a friend named Luke, whom he met when he first started using heroin. Luke was a seasoned drug user and a drunk. Luke and Paul got along well, and since I grew up in this trailer park, Luke had been around just as long as I had. He knew me when I was a child, and he knew me as a teen. I’d pass by Luke often, especially when I went to check the mail. He’d be walking the opposite way, heading to a neighbor’s house, and would always say, “Hey, sweetie.” Luke could be drunk as a skunk or barely able to walk from being so high, but he’d always straighten himself up just enough to slur out “Hey, sweetie” when he saw me.

Luke was around when I had my first child—a daughter—at 16, while I was still in high school. “Hey, sweetie” eventually turned into “How’s the baby?” every time I saw him, whether or not I had my daughter with me. About a year after having my daughter, I was at school. When I came home from the bus stop, I saw tons of police near our trailer. I was still a few yards away, so I kept approaching, trying to see what was going on. There was caution tape around the house, and the back door was hanging open. As a teenager, I brazenly started up the three steps that led into the trailer, but a deputy stopped me and told me I couldn’t go inside.

“What do you mean I can’t go inside? I live here,” I said.

The deputy responded, “I can’t let you in. It’s a crime scene.”

Then Paul appeared, much to my dismay. By this time, Paul was a full-blown addict who had broken my mom down mentally, emotionally, and financially. If Paul was here, my mom was at work as a preschool teacher, and my daughter was at that same school. What was going on?

Paul explained that, around 10 a.m., Luke had come over to hang out. Paul was sitting in the recliner strumming his guitar, while Luke stood in the kitchen. The kitchen had a countertop that separated the living room from the kitchen, so Luke was out of Paul’s direct line of sight. Paul said that Luke came over extremely intoxicated, with a beer in hand. After a few moments, Luke fell down, and Paul assumed he had just passed out drunk. Luke was lying there for about 2-3 hours, and Paul continued strumming his guitar, even singing a song about “Buddy Luke passing out and puking.” It wasn’t until Paul had to use the restroom that he noticed Luke wasn’t just passed out—he was blue.

Paul immediately called 911, and they instructed him to perform CPR, which he did. He described it as the single most foul thing he’d ever attempted to do. Luke had died and vomited, and every time Paul tried mouth-to-mouth, vomit would come out. After a while, Paul couldn’t continue, and he just waited for emergency personnel. The call to 911 was made at 1:12 p.m. By the time I got home around 3:45 p.m., the body had been removed, but the scene was still treated as suspicious, so no one was allowed inside. Eventually, the police let Paul back in, but it wasn’t until after 6:30 p.m. that my mom came home. She was very angry, and my daughter and I were just waiting to go inside. Paul said he’d go in and clean up whatever mess was left behind.

According to him, there was a lot to clean up. About an hour later, he said we could come in. The kitchen floor was so sticky you could hear your feet stick to the linoleum when you walked across it. Heroin addicts aren’t exactly the best maids. We lived in that trailer for at least another year, but I never walked across that floor barefoot—nor did I let my child walk across it barefoot. No matter how much we cleaned, it would always feel sticky.

About six months after Luke passed away in our kitchen, I was standing outside, leaning on the bed of a truck, talking to a friend. The trailer I was standing outside of happened to be the one Luke had lived in for many years before moving to a different one, where he was living at the time of his death. My friend now lived in the same trailer. We were just hanging out, talking, when I heard a very clear, very familiar voice: “How’s the baby?”

Fate of Paul.

Paul later confessed to me that when Luke passed away, he had taken Lukes used syringe out of his sock, and used it to inject himself later that night.

After leaving the trailer park we lived in a small rented house for about a year before my mom left Paul. Paul went back to the trailer park, drug the mattress him and my mom shared into the over grown now wooded area of a destroyed playground that belongs to the church next door. He had a large tent and that’s where he lived. He lived for 6 months after my mom left him. He shot up in his tent, and nodded out with a lit cigarette like I’d seen him too so many times. Usually it would burn his leg and he’d wake up. This time it caught the mattress on fire. He asphyxiated due to an overdose of heroin laced with fentanyl, and burned. Only being found 3 days later by a friend who “couldn’t see the top of his tent anymore” he was identified by dental records
