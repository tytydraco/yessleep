Folks, let me tell you, this story—you’re not gonna believe it. But it’s true, OK? It’s absolutely true. I know because I was told by some very, very smart people. The best people. Nobody knows more about crime than I do, and this one? It’s a big deal. Huge.

So there’s this Assistant United States Attorney, a fantastic person—some say the best attorney, maybe ever. Very successful, works in the Northwestern region of the country. Beautiful area. Not as nice as Mar-a-Lago, of course, but still, beautiful. Anyway, this attorney has been working on big cases for seven years. White-collar crime, federal crimes—high-profile stuff. Not the small potatoes. The big leagues.

Now, let me tell you, this attorney? Doesn’t investigate crimes. No, no, no. That’s not their job, folks. That’s the FBI’s job. You know the FBI. Some great people there, some not-so-great. We all know the stories, OK? But this attorney? They’re not chasing down clues or playing detective. They’re making sure everything is by the book—perfectly legal, perfectly fair. Search warrants, evidence, all the legal stuff. Very important. Tremendous job.

But then, this thing happens. August 22, 2022. A terrible night. Sad! A federal judge comes home—very well-respected judge, by the way. She pulls into her garage, and right away, she knows something’s wrong. A feeling, folks. You ever get a feeling? She’s got this feeling. Something’s not right.

She goes into her house—it’s dark, cold, kind of creepy. She notices little things, like the pantry door is open. She’s very detail-oriented, this judge. Never leaves things open. Never. She’s moving through the house, and suddenly—boom—she trips. Falls to the floor. Carpet’s wet. Not good. Not good at all. She fumbles with a lamp, turns it on, and what does she see? Her son. Dead. Brutally murdered. I mean, folks, it’s terrible. Just terrible.

So she calls 911. The police show up—young officer, his trainer, good guys. They’re trying to do their jobs, but the judge is hysterical. Who wouldn’t be? Her son, gone, just like that. And the scene? Blood everywhere. A mess. And carved into the body is this strange symbol. Very strange. Weird. The officer sees it and knows this is big. He calls for backup, tells them to bring the FBI.

Now the FBI shows up—big-time agents. They’re good. Some of the best. They’re looking at everything, taking pictures, doing all the CSI stuff. And this is where it gets really interesting, folks. Turns out, this symbol? It’s been seen before. Other murders, in other states. Going back years, maybe decades. They realize they’ve got a serial killer on their hands. A real sicko.

And here’s where the Assistant U.S. Attorney comes in. The FBI needs warrants, they need to make sure everything is done by the book. You don’t mess around with this stuff. The attorney steps in—smart, sharp, knows exactly what to do. Works with the FBI, advises them, gets everything moving. Very impressive.

But—and this is a big but—things start getting weird. Strange cars outside the attorney’s house. Papers going missing. Lights flickering. Could it be a coincidence? Maybe. But I don’t think so. Nobody thinks so. Something is happening.

Folks, this is just the beginning of the story. It’s dramatic, it’s suspenseful, and frankly, it’s incredible. You’re not going to hear a story like this anywhere else, believe me. And the Assistant U.S. Attorney? A true hero. One of the best.

Stay tuned, because this is a case like no other. Maybe the biggest case in history. We’ll see what happens, OK? But I think it’s going to be something very, very big.
