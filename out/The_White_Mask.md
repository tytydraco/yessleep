Have you ever had that strange feeling of someone watching you even though... your'e alone? That feeling that cannot be described but can be felt? We've all experienced it in a way or another. But have you ever wondered yourself that this stressful feeling is not just a coincidence? Maybe... Maybe it's more than that. Maybe... this feeling is way more than just a feeling... My story is shocking and may give you nightmares.

It all started when I was 15 years old. I lived in a small house on Shadow Avenue. I was a boring kid and didn't really have anything special. Most of the time I spent was on my computer playing games with my friends Charlie and Emily. They lived far away so I never really met them. We used to play all the time and we had so much fun doing that. We spent long hours with each other that felt like a minute. But one day it all changed.

One day, I turned on my computer and invited Charlie and Emily to a game. We played for like a good hour and it was fun. Until I heard a knocking on my door. "It's getting late honey. Give your beautiful green eyes a rest". It was my mom. I nodded and gave her a kiss on the cheek. "Goodnight mom" I said. I told my friends that I had to go to sleep. I was going to turn off my computer but then, I saw something strange. It was a little message that popped up on the screen from a user named Wraith477 "Play this quiz to win a thousand dollars!". I clicked on the message. Why I did that? Because I had nothing to lose and I thought that maybe I could help my mother financially. The first question was "What is the capital city of France?" And I clicked Paris. "Correct answer!" was written and I smiled. Most of the questions were in the same style. And somehow I wasn't wrong even once... Until the last question. Question number 10. "What is your email account?" I wondered whether to answer or not. But in the end I decided yes.

I woke up the next day with a smile on my face. I got a message from Wraith477 saying "Congratulations! You won a thousand dollars!" I was super excited. Wraith477 asked for my address and name. And so I wrote my address and my name. I didn't know whether to tell my mother or not... On the one hand, its important for her to know and on the other hand, I wanted to make her happy with a suprise. Later that day I got another message from Wraith477 that said "The 1000 dollars are coming soon!" with a smiling emoji.

1:00 AM

I woke up. I didn't know why it happened but it felt strange. Especially since I haven't heard anything. But then, I looked out of the window. At first I couldn't see anything, except for a complete darkness. But for some reason, I felt like there was somthing out there in the darkness. So I had an idea. I opened my door quietly, and I started walking towards the exit of the house. I took a flashlight with me so I could see better. When I left, I started trying to figure out if there was any reason for the discomfort I felt when I woke up. I circled the house to see if there was anything there. But there was nothing but sticks and torn papers. So I went back to the door, I opened it and went back to the room. I went back to bed and coverd myself with a blanket. But I just wanted to take a final look from that window... so I looked out of the window one last time. And then, I saw it clearly. He was tall and had really long arms. He wore black suit and had a shiny white mask. The mask was creepy. It had no eyes, mouth or nose. But I felt like he was looking at me straight in the eye. I felt a feeling I had never felt before. I felt an emptiness that grew with every second that this man looked at me. I remember the silence that screamed... I closed the window and I was silent. What was that? Why was he looking at me? and what does he want?

3 days have passed since what happened. I didn't talk about it with anyone...Even tough I couldn't get it out of my head. But I didn't know that it was nothing compared to what would happen later that day. 

I played with Charlie without Emily. Charlie and I didn't know why she haven't spoken to us for a few days. She didn't answer any of our calls... she just disappeared. After a few hours of playing together, Charlie said he had to disconnect because his mom was mad at him. I told him I'd see him and I heard my mother calling me. I left my room and walked towards her. But then I heard somthing break. I called her but I heard nothing. I took a tennis racket that I had left from a class once and I strated walking towards what I heard. That's when somthing happened that I never imagined. The whole kitchen was full of broken plates, glasses and knives. But then, I got a new message on my phone. It was from Wraith477 that said "The gift has arrived!. At that moment I froze and didn't move. Until I heard a knock on the back door. I walked towards the door very carefully. When I got to the door, I looked through the peephole. That's when I saw and elderly old women. She looked scared and worried. I didn't know who she was, so I didn't open the door. I was stressed so I ran to the bathroom and locked the door. It was late, so there was no normal reason for this woman to just wait outside my house for a long time. I called my mother but she didn't answer. The thought that something happened to mom scared me. I knew I had to relax, so I washed my face. I looked in the mirror and couldn't believe my eyes. My face... was covered by a white mask... The same mask, that the man was wearing. I tried to take it off but I couldn't. I kept trying but the mask was stuck to my face. I started having difficulty breathing, and then I just passed out.

I regained consciousness and lost track of time. I opened the bathroom door and I saw my mother sitting on the couch. She looked down. I couldn't see her face that well, so I moved closer to her. I heard her sobbing. I asked her if she was okay... but she didn't answer. She pointed up at the ceiling and told me to look. And I saw shocked me and made me sick... On the ceiling, there was a girl's body hanging. Blood was dripping from her body. My mother asked me "Do you see this?" But I couldn't answer her. I was disgused by this sight. I didn't know who this girl was, but she felt familier to me. "Oh god... what did you do?" I asked my mother in a frightened tone. Then she looked at me... Her eyes were completely white. She was completely pale. After 5 seconds of her staring at me, she whispered to me... "Thank you for wanting to bring me a gift... son" and shortley after, my mother took a knife from the floor, put it to her throat, and cut herself. Then I got a message on my phone... "I hope she liked the gift" with a smiling emoji.
