I usually like to walk home from work. I have an apartment near my job in Glasgow. I work in a fairly standard office role. I’d mention the company name, but I’m a little nervous about doing that. It’s a well-established but secretive medical tech business. I’d love to give more insight, but I’m just in admin, mostly dealing with sales. I don’t have anything to do with the research or development side.

Today started like any other day. I got a coffee from the café at the front of our building, walked in, took the lift to the seventh floor, and settled in for a long day of handling calls from customers who hadn’t received their medication on time.

I sit next to a girl called Zoe. She has long brownish hair, a slim build, and is usually full of energy. She’s younger than me and often tells stories about her nights out. It takes me back to when I was in my early twenties. I’m just into my thirties now. Zoe’s stories always make me smile. She’s not always great with timekeeping and sometimes turns up late, but she’s kind-hearted and fun to be around.

Yesterday, just as our shift was ending, Zoe and I were both getting ready to leave. Right before we clocked out, our department head called her into their office. I waved goodbye and told her I’d see her tomorrow. That was the last time I saw her. Or at least, the last time I saw her as herself.

Today, I came in and followed the same routine. I didn’t see Zoe at her desk, but I figured she was just running late. Five minutes passed. Then ten. Then thirty. After an hour, I started to feel uneasy. I asked my team leader where she was. They said she had been sent to help out in another department and would be gone for a few days. That sort of thing wasn’t unusual. What bothered me was the way they said it. Their voice had a slight shake to it. Something about it didn’t sit right with me.

I tried to focus on work. The hours dragged as I answered calls and resisted the urge to smash my head against the desk. I had agreed to work late to earn a half day tomorrow. As I was packing up around 8 p.m., I found myself staring at Zoe’s desk. It looked more than just empty. It looked cleaned out. All her things were gone. The little photos she used to pin up were missing. The water bottle she always kept nearby, gone. Her handwritten notes and doodles had vanished too. It was like she had never been there.

Just as I started to really take it in, I heard yelling from the ground floor. I walked to the window and pressed my head against the glass, trying to see what was going on in the alleyway beside the building. A black van had pulled up by the side entrance. There were voices shouting. I ran to the elevator and slammed the button. When the doors opened, the lift groaned a little. I got out at the ground floor, exited through the front, and crept around the side of the building to get a better look.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks. Men in blacked-out gear were gathered around the van. They looked like some kind of military or counter-terrorism unit, but there was no sign of a threat. Behind them were men in lab coats. Scientists, or at least they looked like it. But what really scared me was what they had with them.

There was a person with a collar on, restrained by a hooked cane held at arm’s length. They were growling low, like an animal. Their hair was long and brown. It looked just like Zoe’s. The outfit was hers too. The growling grew louder as they pushed her into the van. I could just make out others inside. Maybe five to seven people were chained to the van’s walls, now including the person I believe was Zoe.

Before I could properly process what I was seeing, a flashlight snapped in my direction. The light was blinding.

“We got someone here,” a deep voice shouted.

I didn’t wait. I turned and ran, heart pounding, straight to my bus stop. I got home and sat in silence. Who am I supposed to call? What do I do when I think my workplace kidnapped someone? Maybe it sounds ridiculous, but I know what I saw.

I just hope someone can help. Or at least tell me I’m not going mad.
