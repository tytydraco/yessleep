-This is a short story, just about 500 words. The main themes are existence and perspective. The topic of the work has heavily weighed on me for a long time. The first version was actually about a 4-D being meeting a human but that quickly became ramblings that meant nothing. The concepts are still the same, but by scaling down the narrative, the main ideas are more easily imagined and understood-

On a sheet of paper among billions in the world, a dot has sat alone for some time. 

One day, an artist picks up a writing utensil, places the pencil onto the paper once more, and the Dot is given a companion.

Dot and his companion are alone in their one-dimensional world. Later, they are met by a third dot.

"I am your Creator," the newcomer says.

"You look like us, so how can you create us?"

"I appear as a you do because this is your world. In mine, I am much different, much more."

"How is this possible? Explain."

"In my world, I am like trillions of dots stacked into a line."

"A line? That's impossible. There is no room for such a shape."

"This is a one-dimensional world. I come from a world with three dimensions."

"Prove it."

The "Creator" contorts, stretching until it covers half of their known universe.

"I am now a Line."

"You've destroyed half our world! You're hideous."

"You see me in two dimensions. Before, I was still and you saw a dot. When I am in motion, I am a line."

"We can't move."

"Yes, you can."

The dot by Dot stretches and transforms into a line, covering both sides of their reality.

"Your companion is now a Line. You can change too."

"I’m afraid. You take up all the space."

"Space is infinite where I am."

"You create and destroy without care."

"Destroy? You don't know destruction."

"I saw it just now."

The pencil erases the Companion.

"Now you have seen destruction."

"I hate you."

"I will create another companion."

"No."

A new dot forms.

"Hello."

"You’re not my companion."

"You have no other companion. Believe in my power."

"I will not."

The pencil erases the new companion.

"You will."

The pencil erases the Line. The paper is set aside by the artist. Even if it was crumpled up, the dot did not notice.

Perhaps he will submit next time. Perhaps another dot on another paper. Perhaps a dot will be able to understand the Pencil as a pencil and not as a dot or like. There may even be a dot that realizes the eraser is a piece of the pencil and not a separate force.

Now the artist can move on to another work. What are they drawing? No one knows, perhaps life; not in any form you would recognize as "life", but so much of the world is already unrecognizable. What if the Dot learned the pencil was covered in the same material his world was made of? How would he even comprehend the tree?
