I was killing time on reddit, scrolling endlessly, when I got an odd notification. It said: *you have been added as an approved user to* /r/dreamtech.

"What the fuck is dreamtech?"

I clicked the link and read the sub description. *The only place to post and view streams and videos using the all new dream capture technology.* "Dream capture technology?" I've seen a lot of weird conspiracy theory and creative subs, so I didn't think much of it. But the sub was blank. There was nothing posted at all. Maybe something up and coming? I wasn't the only one subbed, so for now I decided to stay subbed and see what happens. I made a post that just said "What is this sub for?" and then decided I'd had enough reddit for the night and went to bed.

The next day I woke to a notification. I got a reply to my dreamtech post. It was by u/ubiquitousforesight and it simply said, *Look and see.* I looked at the sub and there was another post, posted by the same user who made the comment. It was a video, and the person in the video was clearly me. I was instantly transfixed. The user was not someone I knew. At least, not somebody I knew that I knew. But there I was in the video, just sitting having a drink at an outdoor café when suddenly I was doused in my drink, sitting looking stunned and wet. Then the video ended. I watched it again, and that's all there was. Sitting outside at a café, then doused in my drink. This is not something that had ever happened to me in my memory, and the point of view was close enough and clear enough that I would have noticed someone recording. I would have remembered something like this happening. The subject of the post was blank. I clicked to see the description which read, *I dreamt about you.* I remembered the description of the sub, something about recording dreams. So this sub must be some sort of prank. Someone did a deepfake of me, and posted it as a dream capture. Solid prank, I guess. But something about it didn't feel right to me. I was anxious, I had so many questions. But I had to leave to meet up with a friend, so I closed the app for now, grabbed my stuff, and headed out the door.

I was rattled and I didn't want to be in a weird headspace to meet up with the bestie. Something about it was so intrusive that I didn't know if I wanted to tell her about it. I tried to put it out of my mind, put in my headphones, and put on my "angry & loud” playlist. That should blast the uneasiness out of my head. I was meeting Liz at our favorite bar that was only a few blocks from my apartment. It was a beautiful day, the first truly crisp day of fall, my favorite time of year, so I walked and listened to music to clear my head.

When I got to the bar Liz was waiting outside. We usually sat at a table inside, but today Liz said, "Can we sit outside? This weather is fantastic!" Liz is very upbeat and perky, and I can't deny her anything when she's excited about it. Plus I loved the weather too, so I was down. We ate and caught up, it had been a few weeks since we had been able to get together and she had a ton of news about what all her kids were up to. I picked up my glass of water to take a drink when the person behind me backed up too much, hit my chair, and I was drenched in the water. That's when my memory flashed. This is exactly the scene from the video I saw myself in. That's when I decided to tell Liz after all. Seeing myself in a random video online is one thing, that scene coming true is something entirely different.

The man who bumped me apologized and asked if he could get napkins for me or anything, but I told him it wasn't a big deal and that I would dry eventually, not to worry. As soon as he was gone I whipped out my phone to show Liz. While getting to the post I explained to her that I had seen a video of me where this exact thing had happened, but when I launched the app and went to the sub, it was blank again. No posts. I went to the user's profile, but it was blank too, there was nothing posted at all. Now, I was seriously freaked out. Liz was a little weirded out, but agreed that it was probably just a prank, and asked me if I knew anyone would think to do something like this, maybe someone who knew we were meeting at this bar today. She promised it wasn't her and I knew it wasn't. She wasn't tech savvy at all and never used reddit in her life.

"Maybe it was the guy who backed into me. Did he look familiar to you? I don't think I'd ever seen him before. He's the only one positioned to make the video a reality." I was thinking out loud and trying to find a rational explanation. "Maybe he was paid to do it by someone I do know, I'll be right back, let me see if I can catch him before he's gone." I ran to chase after him, but I looked down each direction at the end of the block and I couldn't see anyone that fit his description at all. I went back to Liz and sat down, anxious. I felt like someone was watching me at that exact moment.

"Where did you say you saw the video?" Liz asked.

"On reddit, on a sub that says it's for posting videos that use dream capture technology. And the video itself had said 'I dreamt about you' as the description. I mean, I know they're working on the tech to capture and play memories and dreams and stuff, but I haven't heard they were anywhere close to making that happen. Plus this was clearly targeted. It has to be some kind of prank." But I still felt my intuition flicker that something else was happening here, and it was not sitting well with me. I didn't know anyone who would do such a thing and not reveal themselves by now. Maybe they were just holding out and I'd know within 24 hours.

Liz offered to drive me home, given my rising anxiety, and I gladly accepted. I felt exposed and vulnerable and just wanted to be in my apartment. I hate pranks. I said goodbye to Liz, sprinted to my third floor apartment, and locked the door behind me. I went around the house drawing all the curtains and blinds and checking every corner of the house. Once I was sitting down, with a podcast playing to break the silence, I went back to the app and to u/ubiquitousforesight's profile. Still nothing there. I tried to send a chat and to inbox them, but while I kept checking my phone all night, I got no reply. They also didn't post anything more. I fell asleep listening to my podcast and with the bedside lamp on.

The next morning I woke and immediately remembered what had happened the previous day. I quickly pulled out my phone and checked to see if the user had posted anything new. They had. It was a single video. It was me again. It was just another short video, this time of me tripping as I walked down the sidewalk, but I couldn't tell where I was. It was set up the same as yesterday, not title, *I dreamt about you again* as the description. This time I saved the video to my phone. If this happened, I would have evidence. And for good measure, I sent Liz the link to the post so she could see.

Later, as I walked to work - the local coffee shop where I was a barista - I again tried to enjoy the weather and listen to metal and get the videos out of my head, but it was almost impossible. I walked to work and didn't trip at all. When I got to work the smell of coffee and the familiar sounds of milk being steamed and espresso being poured took away some of my anxiety. I put on my apron and went to work. It was a busy shift, we always see a boost in business when the weather starts to chill. I lost myself in it and all but forgot my troubles. Walking home I was listening to my music and checking my texts, replying where needed, when it happened. I tripped on an uneven piece of sidewalk and went sprawling. My heart immediately started beating in double time. I picked up my phone, thankfully unharmed, and started sprinting the rest of the way home.

Once I got in my apartment I bolted the door behind me and checked every corner of every room, as I did yesterday. Once I felt as safe as possible I sat down and texted Liz that it had happened again, that the video I had sent her had come true. She replied that when she finally got to the text the link was gone, there was nothing posted. So I went to my downloads to get the video I had saved, but when I opened the folder, it was gone. Gone from my phone. Maybe the download was corrupted and I didn't notice? That seemed possible but unlikely. When that happens you still see a file, it just won't play. This was... gone.

Over the next month every day u/ubiquitousforesight posted a video. Always short. Always of me. Always something mundane. And as much as I tried to avoid it, they all came true. I felt like I was losing my mind. Liz spent the night for a few nights so she could see the video in the morning as it was posted, and she did. So at least I had a witness. I contacted reddit to report the user for harassment, but whenever I tried to report the specific videos they would disappear just as I was reporting them. So then the user would just have a blank profile and I would have no claim for harassment. Liz tried to record the videos from her phone, but the few times we tried, her video would just show a black screen. It was impossible, but it happened. Every time. And since I had no evidence I couldn't even go to the police. I felt like I was losing my mind. Liz was trying to support me, she told me I should tell the police anyway, but I was afraid I would be taken away to a mental hospital if I tried to explain what was happening. I had checked with every single person I knew, but all of them assured me they wouldn't ever let a prank like that run so long, and most of them had no idea how they would do it in the first place.

After a month of daily mundane videos and no solutions I woke up to my new ritual of immediately checking the sub and found a new type of video. A horrifically graphic video. It showed me hovering over a body that was bloodied and mangled, but the person seemed to be moving. In the video I took my hands and placed them over the person's nose and mouth until they died. I watched it a few times, and futilely tried to save the video or at least capture a screenshot, but to no avail. I left the video up and running and called Liz to tell her, but once I switched back to the app it was gone. I told her about it anyway. I told her that now I was truly afraid. I asked if she would come to spend the day with me, but she told me she was out of town. They had to drive out to her in-law's house last night, which was 6 hours away, because her father-in-law had fallen and hurt himself. She suggested I call out from work and just stay in the house, which is exactly what I was thinking. I called my boss to tell her I was calling out, but she begged me to come in, claiming that there was some strain of stomach flu that had taken out two of the baristas and that I was the only one besides her still available for work. My boss is awesome, and I couldn't leave her stranded, so I decided to go in, but not to walk. I called an Uber to work and resolved to call an Uber on my way home. I would not walk.

The driver was surprised someone would call for an Uber for just 5 blocks, and he was overly inquisitive about it, so I lied and said I had sprained my ankle that morning. I went into work, hoping I didn't get the same driver on my way home, and set to work. It was crazy hectic with just the two of us, but we worked like a well oiled machine and the day went fairly smoothly. After we closed, my boss got a text from her babysitter saying they had an emergency and would need to leave early. She apologetically asked if I would clean up and close up, which I said yes to, with mounting trepidation. Too many emergencies are happening today. It put me on edge. Once the shop was cleaned I scheduled my Uber. I sat in the shop for an hour waiting, but they never came. It was properly late now, and I couldn't get a single Uber. Every time I scheduled one it would say someone was on the way, and then my request would vanish, and the car would change to a different request. Once it was almost midnight I resolved to just run home, letting no distraction get in my way.

I locked the shop and took off, bolting the 5 blocks. I was almost home when I was halted by the flashing lights of cop cars. They were angled sideways, closing off the last block before my house. I thought maybe the bloodied man was there, maybe the cops got there first and I'd never have to see him. I walked up to the cop car and asked if I could go through one block to my apartment. They told me I would have to go around because of an accident. So I started running. Hoping that I would not have to see what the dream video had shown me. I got to the opposite side of the block from the cop cars and stopped dead. The street lights were out, except for a single one in the middle that was illuminating something. I couldn't see what it was from here, but I knew what it would be. Do I try to go down one more block, moving further away from home and into a more dangerous part of town, or do I embrace what I was being corralled into. Suddenly I became angry. Who is messing with me? Why me? What is going on? I knew that going another block down would certainly bring me no answers, and while going forward might not either, it was the only chance I had.

So I went forward, my heart thundering in my chest. I moved at a slow pace until I was standing above the man, just like in the dream. He was shot and bloodied. He looked terrible. He looked close to death. In the dream I had ended his suffering by suffocating him. But this was not a horse or a deer. This was a person, and I was not a murderer. I tried to speak to the man, I asked him if he knew what happened, I asked him if he knew why he was there, I asked if he knew who u/ubiquitousforesight was, though I thought that might be a long shot. He didn't reply to me at all. I was afraid to get my fingerprints anywhere on him, so I did what a rational person would do. This isn't a horror movie and I can use my brain. I called the cops. I told them where I was and what I was looking at, I told them it might be in connection to what was going on a block away. I told them to send an ambulance. I didn't suffocate an injured man just because some psychic dream goblin was tormenting me. I'm not crazy.

Once I hung up the phone the street light above me went black. I reached out to see if the man was still there, but I fell forward and my hands hit concrete. There was an unnatural level of blackness around me for a city, despite the street lights being out. Suddenly there was a loud voice around me, the source of which I could not identify, "Participant 0985973 has passed the test." Then all of the lights came back on, the man was gone, and I was alone on the street. I sprinted home and again locked and checked my apartment. I tried to call Liz, but she must be asleep or at the hospital. I curled up in bed and put my podcast on again. I checked the user's profile, but there was nothing there. I stayed curled in a ball, trying to focus on the voices in the podcast, and finally fell asleep.

On waking, I bolted up and grabbed my phone, which was dead. I plugged it in and paced impatiently until it was charged enough for me to turn it on. Once on I was met with several concerned messages from Liz, which would have to wait. I opened the app and checked. There was nothing. No video, nothing. It seemed I was removed as an authorized user from the sub as well. I have checked the user's profile every day for a month. As far as I can tell u/ubiquitousforesight has not posted another video, and certainly not one of me, but the profile message had changed to "You didn't see what you saw." I check it now and again, but still nothing. I had posted an AskReddit asking if anyone had ever seen a video on r/dreamtech involving them, but nobody replied at all, and it got downvoted and removed. I have no idea what happened and I guess I never will.
