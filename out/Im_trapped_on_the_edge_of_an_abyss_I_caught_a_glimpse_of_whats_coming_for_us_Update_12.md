The night before we prepared to scale the cliff side, I had the dream I’d been waiting for. The one that I’d been dreading.

The ebony desert of shifting glass dunes whirred around me among its ever-present storm, clawing at my exposed skin as sand bits ripped and tore past. I huddled into my jacket to take shelter from it, but that issue was the least of my concern.

Like the first dream, I was alone this time. No clones or friends with me. Not even another dying beast to share in my fear and suffering. It was just me, the black hills, and the abyss around me. My only company was the incessant whispers shuddering from the dark, the weak fingers of their words reaching out to tug at my ears.

“Please make it end…”

“It never ends…”

“It’s infinite…”

“It’s too much—oh God, my mind… I can feel it bleeding the longer I’m here… Like little slivers of glass collecting in its folds…”

I stood motionless there, shivering among the valley of the dunes and whipping my head violently in all directions. It was nearby. It was watching me. If the whispers were calling to me for help, then I knew their keeper was close enough to sense my presence too. Il-Belliegħa. This was finally it.

The sickening popping of bones being cracked made me jump, and for the first time that I’d had one of these dreams, I found myself able to move. The fear was so great at hearing the beast’s movement that the pound from my heart rattled loose the chains holding me in place.

The crackling was coming from just beyond the ridge of the dune ahead of me, so I spun on my heels and took off the opposite way.

“Please help me…”

“Are we so deep that not even death can find us?”

“We didn’t know how deep the earth went—We slipped through the cracks and just kept falling…”

“I don’t remember her face… it was my only solace—please, give her face back to me!”

 There’s the feeling of running in a nightmare—everyone knows it. That slow, sluggish trudge where you pump your feet with all your might, and yet it seems like your body refuses to cooperate. It’s a sensation that everyone loathes once they wake up, but I can tell you with confidence that feeling is much worse when it’s not the dream that’s slowing you down.

I had full control of my body—I had all my usual ability to run. As I clawed and stamped like a maniac at the steep dune before me, however, I made little progress. My limbs woke up the sand as they stabbed into it, and in its anger, the shifting mass threatened to swallow me whole. The ground parted around my hands and feet to swallow them, carrying me back down the slope a foot for every two that I advanced.

Still, my body didn’t give up. A sensation in my unconscious mind, something akin to adrenaline, flooded me like fuel. My heart became the pistons that ignited it, and the ensuing combustion exploded out through every muscle in my body, demanding that they work at max capacity. Even in a dream, I could feel my familiar weak, aching bones, but I didn’t dare let that be an excuse.

*Crunch—crick—crack—pop!*

The steps paced themselves almost; a couple at a time, then silence to let the whispers recite their desperate poetry. Each time they’d start and stop, the sound would draw closer, and I couldn’t help but toss a look back at the opposing dune. It was quickly fading from my limited vision into the fog of the abyss, but that was much worse. I didn’t want to finally learn what the creature was, but if I was going to, I at least needed to see it. This wasn’t an option that coexisted with escape, however. I may not be able to see it, but I had no doubts that its beastly eyes could slice through the darkness to find me. I turned back to the glistening black shift and pressed harder on the gas.

It was stalking me. Like an animal, its pauses were a hound trying to catch a fresh scent. It knew something was here with it in this strange pocket among the abyss’s folds, it just needed to weed me out.

I was nearly to the top of the dune when the snapping limbs began cracking the air once more. My heart began pounding to its limit when I noticed that they were slower this time. More deliberate. Something was wrong and I knew it. A cat rearing up to pounce. The surrounding whispers only confirmed this when they began to cue up again, this time loud and no longer quiet gasps.

“No—No! No, get away! You need to get away!” One screamed.

“Go find help! Please don’t leave us here!”

“My thoughts are already so fragile… I can’t bear more choking them down—I can’t bear more!”

My body ached so badly and my blood was pumping so furiously in my ears that for a moment it almost occurred to me that maybe I wasn’t dreaming. Maybe I had finally slipped over the edge of the shelf into the darkness of the all-consuming void. It all was too real—too tangible to be a dream.

I could see the top now, the spot where the twinkling black stones gave way to pure darkness. My trembling hand shot forward again, hooking the ridge of the dune that melted away like ice. Still, it was enough to take hold, and I hauled myself upward, kicking furiously with my feet until I felt gravity change directions. The last thing I managed to do before my body vaulted the lip and went tumbling down the other side was spare a glance back at the pit of the mountains.

Like the other details I’d seen of Il-Belliegħa, I couldn’t make out much from the shadow, especially with the whipping sand and blurry smears of shapes as my body began to freefall. All I could see was a mess of colors on a massive face peering from the dark; pale like bone, blue like choked skin, and crimson like dark blood. The shapes they were in made no sense to my frantic brain, but one unusual bit stuck out to me unmistakably. One of the shapes cast in scarlet.

A perfectly painted set of red lips, their plastic sheen contoured into an almost lifeless smirk.

I fell for what felt like a mile, this pit far deeper than the last. My head spun and pounded with adrenaline and vertigo, my vision a black washing machine window of glistening sand. The whispers became more and more distant as I tumbled down the dune, grunting and crying out in pain as I slammed against the packed sand. It was decidedly more firm falling down than climbing up.

I thought with each punch that eventually one would wake me, and I’d jolt up in bed back at the tower, but it wasn’t happening, and though I had been relieved moments ago to have escaped the beast, that relief was quickly dwindling as I drew near to the bottom. I wasn’t going to have the strength to escape again if it followed me down.

That went doubly so at what happened next.

Something they warn you about with bone cancer is just how brittle your limbs become, making it much more easy to fracture and break them. It was here, somehow, despite everything that I’d already been through, that in this dream, my body finally shattered.

I landed weird on a leg and felt an unfathomable level of pain spike through me as it went limp and unresponsive. The dangling bottom half of my limb flailed wildly in the wind before repeatedly slamming back down with each tumble, making it mimic the sounds of the creature above me when it moved. I felt wet stuff splashing my face as I flopped, a clear sign that bone had punctured skin, and I wondered if it happened again when I felt my arm crunch at the shoulder.

If I had any hope that the beast hadn’t seen me when I fell over the dune, it was gone as I wailed into the night. It and anything else wandering this forsaken Mojave would know exactly where I was. I couldn’t help it—the pain was too great, searing through every inch of muscle and nerves.

By the time I hit the ground for the last time and felt my body slide to a stop, tears, blood and snot ran down my face as I just lay there and whimpered, unable to move. The pain was nauseating alongside the dizziness that had just been inflicted, and it was all I had not to roll my head and puke into the sand.

Why was I not waking up? How on earth was I able to dream such vivid pain and fear? That sudden worry came over me again that maybe this wasn’t a dream. Maybe somehow Il-Belliegħa had finally gotten me, and this was simply my fate. The thought only made my heart beat faster, and I squeezed my eyes shut tight to clear them of tears. I was ready to resign myself to this. Whatever this was, be it dream or reality, I was ready to just give up.

In my last moments of desperation, however, the ghosts of Trevor, Dad and Mom came to haunt my memories, and I felt my body roll over, propping myself up on my good arm.

‘Not yet.’ I told myself, ‘Not till we make it home.’

I began to crawl as much as my body would allow, one leg kicking and one arm to pull. I wasn’t making it far, but I was moving, and that was all that mattered. Occasionally, I’d toss looks back up the massive slope beside me and listen, waiting to see if I could hear any whispers or bone snaps over the wind, but I never did.

The pain in my bones was unbearable as I shambled along like a moving corpse, dragging a trail of blood behind me. The black sand burned and itched as it crawled into my wound, nestling in folds of tissue and muscle that were exposed. I tried to endure it the best I could, but I collapsed to the dirt when I stretched a hand out to pull myself forward, then felt something hard and jagged stab into my palm.

It wasn’t sharp, but it was a harsh enough change from the fine grains that I was used to that it caught me off guard. I picked myself back up and cautiously fished around again, looking for whatever I’d just laid my hand on. When I found it and unearthed it a little more, I was more than a little confused.

Its colorful plastic contrasted the dunes brilliantly, although its surface was worn and faded. I gripped what I could on it, a small red wheel held in by a rivet, then pulled it out. A scuffed and scratched cartoon duck smiled back at me in cruel irony, as if we’d been playing hide-and-go-seek and it was relieved it no longer needed to hide.

It was a pull-along duck—one of those old toy animals with wheels and a string that would honk and bob its head as you tugged it behind you.

Despite everything going on, I was so fascinated by the toy that I flopped onto my back and set it on my chest, furrowing my brow at it and running my hand over its surface. My thumb dusted over a Fisher Price logo that was barely legible by now, which only made me more intrigued.

Why… was this here?

This was man made. *Human* made. And while yes, the rigs and the town above me somewhere were able to recreate things from our world, this was different. It had time to it—I could see the age by every scratch in its surface from each tiny grain of sand that had passed it by. It was something that I could feel in my gut, the same way I imagined an archaeologist might feel upon unearthing a new relic out of history; this was something that had fallen down here and was not supposed to be.

Was it just the dream? Was this also just some manifestation of my past? I didn’t think so. I’d never owned a toy like this, and I didn’t recall anyone I knew ever having one. Besides, from my currently bleeding bones and aching body, I think it was clear that this was more than just a dream. When I slept, I was somehow casting myself into a different part of the abyss. Slipping down the roots…

So that once again begged the question. What was this duck doing down there? At the bottom of the abyss, in the black desert where all the beasts scurried up from, why was there an innocent child's toy buried in the waste? Kingfisher certainly wouldn’t have had a need for such a ‘sophisticated’ device.

The only answer I could think of made me shudder a bit. This place had to exist before Kingfisher came along and drilled their way to it. They even thought so themselves. But Kingfisher had to learn about this realm from somewhere. Back home, they had to have seen signs that led them to this dark well in the first place.

They knew people would wander into the shelf if they made a ‘gate’ as they called it. But who was to say that before they’d even set up systems to pull people in, there weren’t already unfortunate souls that found their way to this place by some cruel circumstance? All the unexplained disappearances you see in the news and discussed online—what if they hadn’t simply wandered too far into the woods or gotten dragged away by an animal? What if instead, they somehow found themselves here?

A whisper that I’d just heard moments ago suddenly rang through my mind; something one of them had said.

*“We slipped through the cracks and just kept falling…”*

For whatever reason, that revelation is what jarred me awake.

Compared to the violent winds from moments ago, the office was silent save for the breathing of my clones around me. This whole experience has revealed to me that I sometimes snore when I sleep.

I checked the window to see if anything was on the shelf with us, relieved to see that there wasn’t, then I looked down and inspected myself. My leg was as it always had been, and I lifted my arm to give it a few rotates. It ached still, but not as much as it had a second ago. It had been a dream after all, it seemed. Still, I couldn’t ignore the powerful tingle beneath my flesh where I had just snapped the joints there like toothpicks, or the steady rhythm that my heart was still keeping.

I swallowed and looked to the window again, silently praying that I had made it over that dune in time.

Checking my phone, I saw that our alarm was due in thirty minutes. Normally, I would have been upset at not getting to savor the rest, but after the experience I’d just had in my sleep, I was pretty glad to have woken up early.

Given the content of the dream, I thought about waking the others too so that we could set out right away. Clearly there was no time to waste with how close of a call that was, and if the creature had seen me, then that meant even less time. As I sat up fully to do this, however, something stopped me. I knew how stressed Ann was over everything going on, and Hope had just had her breaking point not long ago over the panic of losing our exit. It went without saying that June had a very low capacity for conflict.

Maybe for now, it’d be better to just keep things to myself. I’d keep the girls sharp and on their toes, making sure we move at top speeds from this point forward, but I didn’t think it was going to help anyone to know that our impending doom might be approaching. Time here had proven that we didn’t work well under pressure.

We all knew it was coming eventually, and when that time came, we all knew what we needed to do. The exact time of its arrival wouldn’t change any of that.

I decided to let the others rest for now. They’d need it for whatever we were about to face at the top of the cliffs. This one most likely wouldn’t be as easy as walking in and out of the other rigs like a grocery store; this was much more of a journey. Besides, I needed some time to collect my thoughts after the experience I’d just had.

I leaned against my desk to take a few deep breaths, but as I scanned the room again, I noticed that someone was missing. Hope wasn’t curled up on her pile of cushions, and looking toward the bathroom, the door was open with nobody inside. With worry, I stood and looked around the room, heading for the door when I still didn’t see her.

The hall was its usual empty rotting self, and looking either direction down it, I didn’t see a beam from Hope’s flashlight or hear her moving around. I knew she wouldn’t have left the building without telling someone, which meant that she was either still here, or… or something bad happened.

My heart began to thrum again.

“Hope?” I called in a low whisper, stepping toward the control room stairs. Maybe she went up there. Maybe she woke up early like me and just wanted to go check on some things before our big journey out.

“Hope, where are you?” I called again, a little louder this time.

I reached the bottom of the steps and looked up at the shut double door near the top. There was no light or sound coming from up there either, and now I was getting really worried.

The sound of approaching footsteps made me whirl around, and I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw a figure emerge from the breakroom door. I fumbled my flashlight on and prepared to start swinging, but then I saw the beam shine across Hope’s face, the girl shielding her eyes from the sudden light.

I breathed a sigh of relief and lowered my weapon, “Jeeze! You scared the crap out of me!”

“Sorry,” Hope mumbled, wiping away the light still lingering in her eyes, “I thought I’d be back before the alarm went off. Is it time already?”

“No, we still have thirty; I thought I’d let Ann and June sleep. What are *you* doing up?”

“Was feeling restless,” Hope pursed her lips despairingly before leaning on the door frame. Realizing her sour expression, she pulled back up a smile, “You?”

“Same here,” I lied quickly.

She hesitated a moment and looked me over, as if she didn’t quite believe my response, but thankfully she didn’t call it. Instead, she nodded to the break room, “I was just hanging out alone in here to gather my thoughts. I wouldn’t mind talking instead if you’re looking for company.”

Admittedly, I wasn’t. Like I said, after the dream I just had, I wanted some time alone. Still, Hope was the best company I had around here, and we didn’t get much time to enjoy it with each other these days. Besides, Hope had been off for the last week ever since her argument with Ann, and I wanted to make sure she was doing alright.

I nodded then joined her.

We both crashed down onto the couch, and I waited a moment before I drew attention to it, “Are you doing okay?”

“Hm?” Hope said, facing me before quickly turning away again, “Oh, yeah. I’m good. Happy we got to the catwalk, but I guess pretty nervous too. About what might be up there.”

I nodded and acknowledged her deflection, her words clearly truthful with her intent. It wasn’t what she knew I was looking for, however, so after a beat, I tried again, “How about everything else?”

Realizing she couldn’t hide anymore, she sighed and leaned forward, resting her elbows to knees and palms to chin, “I’m fine Hen, I just… I feel like a jerk. What I said to Ann the other day—”

“Hope, it’s fine,” I quickly stopped her, “Tensions were high, and you of all people deserved to finally vent some of that out at the peak of it. Lord knows Ann and I already got to have our little meltdowns.”

She shook her head, “That doesn’t excuse it. I shouldn’t talk like that, and Ann didn’t need to hear it.”

“Honestly?” I said, glancing to the door, just in case, “I kind of think she did. At least some of it. She needed a good reality check, especially the part about making up her mind. She’s too bipolar about all of this, and that kind of rashness is going to hurt us in the long run.”

Hope didn’t shake her head this time, but I knew she still disagreed. Trying to make me understand, she took a different approach, “Hen, you know you hate yourself more than you should, right?”

That honestly took me back a bit, “What?”

“All your life—well, all of *our* lives—at least for a while… I know you’ve hated us.”

I swallowed hard and shook my head, “Hope, I don’t hate you—I didn’t even know you existed, and if I had—”

“N-No, it’s okay, that’s not what I meant,” Hope said, patting my leg in reassurance, “I mean, you hate yourself. Every part of yourself, and I wish you didn’t.” She turned to face me. “I am you, so I get how tempting it is with all the mistakes we made and with all the problems we couldn’t fix, but… I’m also the you that sees all the good in us. Everything that’s not worth hating.”

My defense mechanism was to snicker her words away, “Hope, what are you saying right now?”

She patiently stared at me and didn’t let my snark get in the way of her point, “I’m saying that there’s a lot more good in you than you let yourself believe, and I don’t think you hear it enough. I think you started telling yourself that you’re worthless so often that you started to believe it.”

“What does this have anything to do with Ann?” I said, feeling a smidge of frustration beginning to build. Maybe I should have just gone back to bed after all; I really didn’t feel like getting lectured by a clone of myself right now.

Hope could see my resistance and shook her head, turning the topic from me back to my clone, “Because Ann is that to an extreme. She’s clearly the part of you that hates us the most, and I don’t think she sees much good in us at all. She thinks my optimism is fake, she thinks June’s sensitivity is weakness, and she second guesses you on everything because she thinks you’re the one who ruined our lives back home, so how can you possibly make decisions now?”

“I am the one who did that,” I can’t help but scoff darkly.

“No, Hen, that’s exactly the issue—with all of this,” Hope sighed, rubbing her eye before reaching out to take my hand, “You all don’t see what I do. All that good beneath the bad. I know we suck a lot of the time, but damn it, Hen, we can also be beautiful people. We read to mom everyday at that hospital and never left her side one time just because we didn’t want her to be scared.”

“We also never let her say what she wanted to say before she died because we were too scared to hear it,” I argued back.

Hope plowed on, “We learned to cook for Dad after mom died because he was so depressed that he wouldn’t feed himself.”

“We needed to eat too. We were kids.”

“We kept our diagnosis a secret from him because you didn’t want him to feel that pain from mom all over again.”

“I kept it a secret because I was afraid of how he’d react. We told him if there were ever symptoms we’d get them looked at and we didn’t. We failed him, Hope.”

“Do you see?” The other me asked, accusingly sticking her hands out, “No matter what, any bit of good we do gets buried by the bad. It’s been that way for a long time, and it’s what keeps you held back. I know we did those things for good, Hensley, because that’s why *I* remember doing them. And if I’m you, then that means you did them for that too; you can’t deny it.”

I opened my mouth to start, but didn’t interrupt her this time with a snide remark or a condescending chuckle. I just looked at her as she stared forward into the dark, wrestling with the emotions plaguing her.

“And Ann? Like I said, she’s that hatred to the max. If anyone needs to be spoken to with love and compassion, it’s her. She needs to see that there really is good in her, and that her determination has gotten us farther than any other part of you.” Hope chuckled to herself darkly, and shook her head, “And so what do I do? The part of you that’s supposed to be ‘good’ and ‘compassionate’? I scream at her and tell her that she’s the reason we’re here in the first place.”

I waited for her to continue, but that seemed to be all she had to say. That simply left me to sit in silence and chew on her words. I didn’t quite understand it, if I was being honest, but I at least got the point she was making about Ann. The girl was already drenched in malice; she didn’t need more piled on.

Still, she was a lot to deal with on a good day, and sometimes you needed to slap some sense into somebody.

“You apologized, Hope,” I told her, awkwardly placing a hand on my clone's shoulder, “You told her you didn’t mean it, and I’m sure she knows that. If she’s still angry after all that, then that’s on her. But knowing myself? She won’t take it personally.” Giving the girl a small rock with my arm, I smiled, “And even if she does, you know there’s such thing as righteous fury, right?”

Hope sniffled a bit, then looked at me.

I shrugged, “‘Beware the temper of a gentle man’, or however that old saying goes. You’re allowed to get angry when enough is enough, and I think of all the times for you to get upset, that was a reasonable one. You were just defending June and I, and that’s a noble cause.”

The girl nodded, then wiped her face off, pulling up a smile, “Sorry to dump all that on you. I know we’re having bigger problems right now.”

“It’s okay. We used to have talks like this with ourselves in our head back before all this, remember? It’s nice to sort feelings out in an actual conversation, you know?”

Hope chuckled, then gave me a small hug. After releasing, though, her demeanor went stoic, and she spoke soft, “Are you going to tell me the real reason you were awake?”

I felt my stomach drop, but knew there was no point in avoiding it. Hope would know why whether I told her or not, and honestly, it might be a good idea for at least one person to know.

“I had the dream again,” I mumbled.

The weight that fell over us was palpable, and I could hear Hope’s breath hitch.

“Did… it see you?”

“I’m not sure. This time I could move and I tried to run away from it but… I honestly don’t know if it saw me or not. Either way, we’re out of time.”

Seeing the girl's pained face, I did regret saying something after all, but she at least could put on a convincing mask. With a nod, she said, “Well, we’d better move fast to the next rig then.”

“Yeah…”

“What do you think is waiting for us up there?” Hope pondered, falling back to the cushions.

My tongue dug at my cheek while I looked to the ceiling, and I spoke plainly, “I’ve been thinking about that. The rigs, I mean. Back at the house, I noticed a pattern.”

Hope perked up a bit, “What’s that?”

“It was about June. Do you remember Mom’s lullaby?”

Hope nodded, “I figured that’s why she chose that name.”

“The angel was singing it too,” I told her, “When Ann and I went for the body, I realized the humming it was doing was to the tune of her song. And looking back on that house, when we lived there? I was a lot like June back then. Quiet, reclusive, choked up on emotions.”

“You threw her up right when that rig went off,” Hope noted, catching on.

I nodded, “She’s not the only one. It was only a day or two after we met that Zane's showed up, and I told you that was the last day I remember being happy. That said, we’ve already established what part of me you splintered off from.”

“So…you think the rigs are manifestations of us?” Hope questioned.

“It might be the opposite, actually,” I told her, “The rigs are connected to the roots, and the roots are connected to me. If we understood what Shae was saying correctly, then the rigs would just siphon my memories to manifest things. They’re malfunctioning, though, without proper cores plugged in. Maybe each time one goes off, the ‘roots’ are getting clogged, and it’s sending it back down the line to me.”

“And… you’re manifesting a version of yourself that corresponds to the rig.”

I nodded.

Hope turned forward and got quiet, “Ann would have been the second rig then. The one we’re going to now.”

“Yeah.”

“So whatever she came from…”

“It’ll probably be just as angry and bitter as she is.” I sigh, “I think we’re in for a fight.”

Hope leaned back, “A little more than that if your dream turns out true, too.”

I looked down at my lap, a dark feeling in my chest bellowing up strong until it came out almost like a nasty belch, “Should we just do it now, Hope? Should we just… make sure it doesn’t get us?”

“No.” She said instantly, turning to me, “No. We still have time. We’ll figure this out.”

I swallowed that bitter feeling back into the depths of my gut, then nodded. Hope stood and offered a hand that I took, yanking me to my feet, “We should get moving.”

I nodded once more, then we headed back to the room.

The two of us moved quietly and tried to do the same as we opened the door, affording our comrades just a few more moments of rest. It turned out that this was unnecessary for Ann, as once I swung the door open far enough, I saw a dull light filling the space; the laptop screen gleaning out onto my 3^(rd) clone's face. Her eyes darted up to me fast, and she put her hand on top of the screen, closing the lid slightly so that she could see me better.

“Oh, you’re already up,” I noted.

Ann nodded, “So are you.”

“Couldn’t sleep. Pretty anxious about today,” I said, stealing Hope’s excuse. I nodded to the laptop, “What are you up to?”

Ann looked back to the screen and clicked around a few more times before shutting it and sliding it away, “Just trying to see if I could find any more clues on how to get the damn door open.”

“Any luck?”

“No.” She said darkly, turning to her backpack, “Well, are we ready then? We should get moving; it’s going to be a long day. June, wake up.”

June shot up fast at the sudden volume raise, then wiped her groggy eyes as she returned to her senses. Hope finally entered the room beside me, and Ann made a face, “Where were you two?”

“Oh, just talking,” Hope said nervously, not having expected to confront the person we were just shit talking, “Didn’t want to disturb you two.”

Ann didn’t seem to care about that answer, as she immediately went back to gathering her things. We all did. Aside from basic communication on who was bringing what, we shuffled all of our supplies into our packs, then threw them over our shoulders, taking one last look at the room around us to make sure we weren’t missing anything. The good part about being stuck here with nothing was that we could always pack light.

The walk toward the ladder was just as solemn as our packing. Just the ambient silent drone of the abyss to fill the air. I eyed the parts of our project that were visible with high scrutiny, hoping that makeshift rungs were going to be able to hold up for just two more trips. From so far back, it was nauseating how curved and crooked the panels looked as they wound up the dizzyingly high rock. I made a mental note not to think about it once we were actually scaling it.

When we reached the wall, Hope looked up the ladders before turning to us, “Alright, this is it; no going back once we’re up. Is anyone forgetting anything?”

I shook my head, and June did the same, albeit with more furtive glances toward the ladders.

Ann’s eyes went to the Kingfisher door only a few feet away before she determinedly blew past us, grabbing the first rickety rung, “What are we waiting around for?”

I thought my heart would be pounding as I climbed but it was more numb than anything. I guess all the excitement from the morning had really tired it out, and after climbing this wall so many times already, the dangerous charm had worn off. I think the real numbness came from trying to prepare for whatever came next. Just turn my brain off and tunnel forward…

The only time I really felt a jump in my stomach was when I’d look up at the other girls above me, and see the catwalk dangling like a wind chime. I ended up last on the ladder with June ahead, then Hope and Ann after that. This meant that once we hit the top, I had to wait the longest while watching the others vault over my head to the catwalk rail. That part really did kick my heart back to life.

Ann went first, grabbing her carabiner and rope from the side of her pack and fastening one end to the ladder. After that, she looked out at the space between her and the catwalk, then held her breath.

“If I die, don’t waste time mourning,” She told us, before leaping from the wall.

Hope let out a sharp squeal of surprise at how much the panel we’d clamped to the wall shook when Ann jumped away from it. In the beam from the light she was holding, Ann sailed through the air; a mere second that felt like a full minute. Frantically, her arms shot out and hooked the rusty pole waiting opposite from her before she scrambled her legs up and onto the ledge. June, Hope and I all released our breath as Ann vaulted the rail onto the ‘safety’ of the metal grating.

The metal groaned and creaked, waking up beneath her boots after so much time being neglected. It was intimidating to be sure, but it didn’t sound like it would suddenly crumble beneath her feet, so she hooked the other side of her rope around the rail then stuck her hand out.

“Alright, get up here,” she called to Hope.

My second clone went next, the same as Ann, but this time with the added security of the rope. The ladder once again let out a threatening jolt as Hope jumped away from it, but with Ann ready to catch her and help haul her up, it was over before we knew it.

Ann climbed the steps a bit as to not place too much strain on one platform, then she called down to June, “Alright, June, nice and easy!”

June hesitated a long beat of time before moving up the ladder to the jump point. She clung to it tightly like a child to their mother's legs, giving one last look down before realizing her mistake and shooting her gaze back up.

“Don’t do that!” I told her as encouragingly as possible, trying to not let frustration grow in my voice, “Just focus on Ann, she’ll catch you!”

“A-Are we sure this is safe? That thing looks old…”

“Yes, June, Hope just did it too, now hurry up, we’re burning time,” Ann snapped.

June looked out at the hanging platform again, then let herself away from the ladder ever so slightly, tensing her muscles to jump. As she did, however, I saw her eyes tilt down a bit back toward town, then widen. Immediately, I snapped my head to follow her gaze, and quickly saw why.

Something was out in the town just near the edge of the cliff. A large building that we’d never seen before surrounded by lights that were slowly growing brighter. Streetlamps in a parking lot. I felt a similar surprised emotion to June because, staring at it, even at such an odd angle, I recognized it instantly. The 4^(th) rig was manifesting itself in the form of my old favorite drinking spot; the place that I’d met Trevor.

It was the Warehouse.

At first, I was elated. The relief in my stomach when I realized that we might actually have a chance of getting out of here was unmatched. All we needed to do was clear this clifftop rig, then scurry back down and snag the body out of the next one. We may actually stand a chance of escape before Il-Belliegħa returned to its post.

The only problem was that I suddenly realized it wasn’t what June was looking at.

The tower light was also kicked on.

Hope and Ann caught this too, and the latter let out a cry of protest, “Are you shitting me? One of those things was *just up here* last night!”

“C-Come on, June! We need to hurry; it’ll be okay!” Hope encouraged.

I didn’t bother to look up at any of them now, or even to help encourage June across. My eyes were glued firmly on the town below. I scanned every street I could make out—every nook that I could see, praying that it wasn’t time yet. Praying that the monster up here wasn’t the one I’d just tempted fate with.

I finally caught it heading down the main road right past the tower. In the deep red light that spilled into the streets, I saw the dark silhouette of something big silently dash down the block. The good news was that it didn’t appear to be the beast I was dreading. The bad news was that it was fast, and most likely just as deadly.

My body jolted as June finally made the jump across, letting out a scream of fear as she barely caught the rail. Hope sprinted back down the steps to help Ann haul her up, and I finally tore my eyes from the road to scale up the rest of the way.

“Come on, come on, come on…” I mouthed over and over as I watched my clones struggle to haul the third over in a panic. Those words suddenly became stuck in my throat, however, when the nausea and adrenaline of the situation finally caught up with me, and I felt my stomach swell.

‘Wait, no… No, not right now, please not now…’

I clenched my jaw shut tight and gripped the ladder white knuckled, trying hard to keep it from happening. My limbs turned to jelly as the nausea pulsed a heavy wave once more, and it was almost impossible to hold on to the unstable panel at how badly it was hitting me. I had to let it out. Whether I liked it or not, I had to.

Holding on with one hand, I clasped the other to my mouth and let the blood erupt through my fingers. It coated the cliff face and poured down the rungs, but I didn’t care. I just needed to catch the important part. I felt the wad of meat slipping up my throat as I sat doubled over on the ladder, and just as it hit the back of my esophagus, it shot loose.

I had never tried to catch one before. With June, Ann, and Hope, they’d all slipped out straight to the ground. I didn’t realize how hard it would be. I didn’t realize that any strength I had would need to be focused on gripping the wall and not letting go. That’s why when my 5^(th) clone came slipping out, I didn’t know what to expect.

It slipped out like a greased up worm, and though I tried to clasp it in my fingers, I… The blood… and the mucus—it was too slippery it…

I watched the bit of flesh slip from my palm and go tumbling into the darkness below.

“N-No!” I muttered weakly.

“Hensley, what are you doing!? Get your ass over here!” Ann yelled, “We need to move!”

She was right. In the floodlight below, around the spot that the next me would have landed, I saw the shadowy creature skim through the light and start up the wall. I could hear the ladders beneath me rattling and knew that it was now or never. The nausea subsided as adrenaline took over, and even though I was still in a hazy state of mourning, I pushed away from the wall.

I remember Ann and June catching me, but I don’t remember much after that. I was hauled onto the platform, and then we all started to run as fast as we could. The catwalk jolted beneath our collective weight the whole way up, then again when the beast chasing us leaped over to it too.

The whole structure sounded like a demented instrument as frantic feet charged up it, all at different intervals. Me and the girls hit the top first, then didn’t stop running into the woods that waited for us. We knew the creature would still be close behind, and we had no idea where the rig was.

All we could do was what we always did. Keep moving forward and hope for the best. The only problem this time was that I was leaving someone behind…
