I just saw the weirdest thing through my neighbor’s window.

I’d just returned from bartending, so it was like 3 AM. My apartment was dark except for the overhead light in the kitchen I’d just flipped on after walking in, and all the windows across the courtyard from mine were dark too, except for one. I went to my window for a closer look. There’s a pretty girl who lives in that part of the building, and I wasn’t watching her or anything, but I could see her there, sitting in her own mostly darkened apartment, lit only by the bluish light from her laptop screen. She was up working late, I guess.

Anyway, I didn’t want to be a creep so I started to turn away, but I saw her move suddenly. She looked over her shoulder, then turned back to her screen. I didn’t understand why at first. I thought maybe someone said something to her, but It didn’t look like there was anyone else in the apartment with her, though it was hard to tell in the dark.

She looked again, then she got up. Her apartment is the same as mine, we live in a big U-shaped building, and we both have the same large windows across the entire back of the room, so I could see her clearly as she walked all the way across her apartment and then stopped, just staring at the far wall.

I glanced instinctively toward my matching wall, but of course there was nothing there to see. Just my second hand couch, cinder block coffee table, and the rusty air vent on the wall above them.

When I looked back she was already walking back to her desk. She sat down and it looked like she put in earbuds, so I figured something must have been making a noise she didn’t like. Pipes rattling, maybe?

At this point I guess I got curious and I watched a little longer, but I swear I was about to turn away again when… Well, this is when things got weird. I saw her air vent cover just kinda pop off and fall on the floor. It must have hit with some kind of thud, but she obviously didn’t hear it.

Ok, this part is kinda hard to write, because it doesn’t make any sense. I’m just gonna tell you what I saw. Something sort of poured out of the vent. Or someone? Shit, I’m gonna go with something. It—well, she—kinda landed on the floor and then stood, and she was enormous. She was so thin I could see her hips and ribs jutting out underneath that pale skin. I don’t think she was wearing anything, but she had this lanky pitch black hair that was so long it was kinda hard to tell for sure.

But her arms—something was seriously wrong there. They hung down past her knees and seemed to just kinda peter out. No hands, just a sort of nub.

Fuck, I wish I had done something then, but I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t understand what was happening. This strange woman-like creature just started sauntering forward. I watched it stalk across the room, slowly closing in on my neighbor. Then she raised those strange arms and she opened her mouth, and it was like her whole head split open. She towered over the girl at the desk, all pointy teeth and pointy arms, and somewhere in there I realized I was desperately banging on the glass, but I was too far away to make any difference.

The girl didn’t even have a chance to scream. The creature struck, squeezing its inhumanly long arms around my neighbor and her whole head just sort of disappeared into the creature’s. I saw her arms flailing, nails clawing at the arms around her for what seemed like ages. Then she just kinda went limp.

At this point I know I should have done something, anything, but I was just kinda frozen in place. My mind was reeling. I just kept thinking this couldn’t be real.

I don’t know how long the thing just hunched over her like that, but the next thing I saw was the girl’s body slumping forward, head hitting her desk, arms hanging loose, like some kind of a ragdoll. The creature had risen back to its full height, and it turned away, and started back across the apartment. Her gait was different this time. More casual. It wasn’t stalking prey.

I watched breathlessly as the creature paused in front of the air vent. And then it turned and looked out the window. Right at me.

I jumped behind the little section of wall that separates the windows, standing sideways, holding my breath, praying somehow it didn’t see me.

I didn’t want to look, but I had to know what it was doing. I leaned forward, edging back in front of the window, peeking with one eye. But there was nothing there. The creature, or woman, or whatever it was… She was just gone.

My heart was running a marathon but there was nothing for me to do now. I found myself just kinda staring at the girl, slumped on her desk, for what I think was a long time.

Then she sat up.

Just when I thought things couldn’t get any more surreal. How was she not dead? She stirred, and kinda gingerly sat back in her chair. She looked around, like she was confused, then I saw her staring at her screen for a minute and she just started typing again.

Like nothing had happened.

This is so fucked up.

So I came on here and started typing this up. I didn’t really know what else to do, but I thought I better get it down while it’s still fresh, before I start second guessing myself. I didn’t drink or anything at the bar. Not anything that could

oh shit my vent is making a weird noise.
