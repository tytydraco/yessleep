**CHAPTER ONE – CLEARLY, I’M DEAD**

My name is Mark Espo. That's me lying face down in the grass. Under the night sky. Frontal bone shattered to pieces.

Those boots you see next to me– splattered with my brains– that's my killer. Her name is Maddie– Maddie Marshall. Wait til you see the rest of her.

I'm not a small man. 6’2”, 215 lbs. Sure, I'm past my prime at 40-years-old, but I’m in better shape than most. That isn’t to brag. That’s to say… this woman– this monster– she makes me look and feel like a 5th grader.

See her farmhouse in the distance? That’s where I woke up about an hour ago.

While I was getting my bearings, little did I know that not far from here– at a cabin in the woods– workers in biohazard suits were cleaning up a 9-person massacre.

Death is everybody’s demise in this twisted hell masquerading as a sanctuary.

And the kicker is… if I knew then what I know now, I'd still be fucking dead.

**This is your first warning:**
It doesn't matter where you live, how you live, or who you live with.

You could be a woman, a child, a grandparent, or a middle-aged dad like me.

It. Doesn't. Fucking. Matter.

‘Cause at any moment, you can be plucked from your current existence– gone without a trace– to suffer the same fate as the rest of us.

**CHAPTER TWO – MOMENTS BEFORE MY ABDUCTION**

There I am. Dressed in a hoodie and joggers. Frontal bone intact. I tuck my three-year-old daughter into bed and kiss her goodnight.

“‘Night, sweetie. I love you.”

I slink inside the next room where my wife sits in bed, feeding our six-month-old son. I grab my headlamp. Check the battery level. It flashes YELLOW.

“You’re really going for a run right now?” She prods.

“I don’t see what the big deal is.”

“You can’t go to bed with us?” Another statement posing as a question.

“I’ve been with them all day. What else do you want me to do?”

“Fine. Go.”

CREAKKK! Someone creeps in the hall.

I lower my voice. “I’m sorry I don’t have breastmilk.”

“Don’t.” She eyes our son, refusing to look at me. “There’s plenty in the freezer and you know it.”

I bite my tongue. “I’ll be back in an hour.”

“Don’t wake us up.”

“Should I… stay out longer?”

She glares at me.

I go to kiss her, but she dodges me. “Okay. Love you too.” 

I move into the hallway and glance at the master bedroom. Door’s open. Bed’s vacant. “Mom?”

No answer.

I knock on the doorway. “Mom? You okay?”

Still nothing.

“Mom…”

My mom ambles out of the bathroom. In her pajamas. She’s gotten worse since her diagnosis last year. The hunch in her back is more pronounced and instead of stepping, her feet shuffle across the floor.

“Yes?”

“You good?”

“You don’t need to check on me, you know.”

I flash a tight smile. “So we should move back to California then?”

She glares at me. “I’m fine.”

“Mom, you fainted again today.”

“It’s just low blood pressure. It happens.”

“No, Mom. It’s the Parkinson’s.”

She rolls her eyes.

“C’mon.” I motion toward the bed. My dad’s photo sits on her nightstand.

“What are you gonna do, tuck me in?”

“Yup.” I spot her as she climbs into bed.

“Okay. Goodnight.” She shoos me away.

I tuck her in like a burrito. She struggles to hide her smile.

“If you need anything– if you need to get up–”

“Enough. I’m good. I’ll scream if I’m not. Promise.” That’s the fighter in her. The fighter she instilled in me.

“‘Night, Mom. I love you.”

“Love you too.”

I kiss her on the cheek then head for the hall.

“Hey Mark…” She calls out.

I turn in the doorway.

“Life moves fast, sweetie. One second you're brought into this world. The next you’re bringing someone else into it. Then before you know it, you’re on your way out.”

I nod. Aware she was eavesdropping on me and my wife.

“Cherish these moments. They don’t last forever.”

We share a sweet smile– our last smile together.

**CHAPTER THREE – GONE WITHOUT A TRACE**

I jog on the damp street. Against traffic. No cars on the road. Homes are sprinkled with snow and decorated in Christmas lights. The winter New Jersey air feels good on my face– in my lungs. Makes me feel alive.

Physically, I’m running from nothing. But mentally– emotionally– I’m running from life– from being a stay-at-home dad and a caretaker to my mother.

A car passes me from behind. On the other side of the road.

These legs are old and tired. They’ve endured sprains, breaks, tears, and surgeries. This back has been through the ringer. Herniations, pinched nerves, and more surgery.

Still, I pick up my pace. My body’s reward for enduring is more endurance. It’s the only way I know how.

As long as I don’t slip on any black ice, I’ll be good.

An SUV speeds toward me. On the same side of the street. They flick on their high beams, blinding me.

I shield my eyes as the SUV passes. Fucking asshole.

I run harder.

After a moment, a minivan drives behind me. On the other side of the road. Well under the 35 mph speed limit.

I glance over for a second. A little unnerved.

The van speeds off, disappearing around a bend.

I jog around the turn to see…

The minivan is parked on my side of the road, facing me. Engine off.

I stop and stare at the van. Something isn’t right. I study the home it’s parked in front of. Tells me nothing.

“You’re being stupid.” I tell myself. “You’re a 40-year-old white man. In Suburbia, New Jersey. Calm the fuck down.”

I edge across the street. Just to be safe.

As I pass the van, I move into a backpedal. My eyes dart between the minivan and the home. Unaware that three men dressed in all-black hide in the bushes behind me.

Satisfied I’m safe, I turn to jog again…

SMAAACK! The men jump out and grab me.

I fight like hell.

Somehow, I break free.

But I’m quickly tackled to the asphalt.

SHUNKKK! A syringe plunges into my neck.

Within seconds, my world goes black.
