**Warning: This post is quite extensive, but I highly recommend reading it in its entirety.**

In this narrative, I recount an incident that occurred when I was approximately nine years old (I am now 25). It is an experience that has left an indelible mark on my memory, and it still evokes a sense of awe and trepidation.

I reside in a terraced house, a common architectural style in many urban areas. Each unit is connected to the next, forming a network of interconnected houses. Each unit is equipped with a small patio, providing a private outdoor space. A narrow road, approximately ten meters in width, separates my patio from the road used for leisurely walks and other activities. My neighborhood is characterized by a high density of terraced houses, making encounters with pedestrians on the road a frequent occurrence. However, the sight of strangers on my patio is a rare occurrence.

On a particular day, I returned home from school approximately an hour before my mother arrived from work. Given my proximity to school, approximately fifty meters away, my mother believed that I was mature enough to remain home alone for an hour before her return. This particular day, I successfully completed my schoolwork and returned home. I adhered to my customary routine, ensuring that both the front and back doors leading to my patio were securely locked. (Although being alone, even during the daytime and for a brief period, was still somewhat unsettling for me.) Subsequently, I ascended the stairs to engage in extended gameplay on my PlayStation console before my mother returned home and assigned me homework.

While immersed in my gaming session, I was startled by a sound emanating from outside my window. (My room was situated on the second floor above the patio, affording me a view of the road previously mentioned.) The noise resembled the purring of a cat. However, my cat had been missing for an extended period of over three months. A glimmer of hope ignited within me, and I entertained the possibility that it could finally be my beloved feline companion. With a sense of urgency, I descended the stairs to ascertain its identity. Unfortunately, the sight that greeted me was profoundly disturbing and continues to evoke a sense of unease even as I recount it.

On my patio, a tall, black-haired man stood. His eyes were partially obscured by his hair, resembling the male version of the ring women’s look. I could hear him making high-pitched sounds, almost like a cat meowing. A brown liquid dripped down his mouth, and I observed him spitting out my father’s stomped cigarettes. He was actually consuming from the ashtray. I was transfixed, observing this peculiar scene, until I finally regained my composure and emitted a piercing scream, likely alerting the man to my presence. However, he remained unperturbed, continuing to eat from the ashtray.

I ascended the stairs to my room, secured the door, and promptly contacted my mother. She promptly notified the police, instilling a profound sense of fear within me. Lying in bed beneath my sheets, shivering with apprehension, I could hear the unsettling high-pitched noises emanating from the individual consuming cigarette stomps from the ashtray on my patio.

For a brief moment, I experienced a state of blackout, the next recollection being the arrival of the police on the road adjacent to my yard. I overheard their conversations with the individual, engaging in inquiries such as “what are you doing?” and “move here or we will apprehend you.” Despite his lack of response, the frequency and intensity of the high-pitched sounds intensified. Feeling a semblance of safety in the presence of the police, I decided to observe the situation through the window.

I observed two police officers standing by my fence: a male and a female. Unfortunately, I was unable to perceive the individual due to his position directly below me, rendering him out of my field of view. The police promptly leaped the fence, and I distinctly recall hearing the individual emit a scream that surpassed any other sound I had ever encountered. He charged the female officer with full force, causing her to fall unconscious. The male officer swiftly administered a taser, leaving the individual trembling on the ground, still emitting screams. The police officer struggled to maintain his composure while restraining the individual and securing handcuffs. Eventually, he managed to subdue the individual.

After some time, he managed to rouse the female police officer, who appeared severely injured. He promptly called for backup and an ambulance. As he did so, he noticed me standing in the window above him. My expression must have been unreadable because he simply looked at me and uttered, “I sincerely hope you did not witness all that.” Tears welled up in my eyes. By then, neighbors had begun to gather, curious about the commotion. One of my elderly neighbors, concerned for my well-being, guided me downstairs and provided me with comfort until my mother returned home. The police escorted the unsettling individual away in their car and promised to return to discuss the incident with us.

This is where the story takes an unexpected turn. Later that night, the male police officer returned and met with my mother and me to discuss the events that had transpired. He revealed that the man on my patio had been diagnosed with severe autism. He had escaped from a facility housing mentally challenged individuals, situated approximately 5 kilometers from my residence. The officer explained that the individual had actually been residing in my house five years prior. However, he was compelled to relocate when his mother, his sole caretaker, passed away. Understandably, the man had mistakenly believed he would find his mother in my house. He had grown accustomed to the routines and cherished the companionship of his mother. Consequently, the police had to relocate him from the house five years ago due to his exceptional strength. (From what I gathered, he had endured intense physical tension as a result of his autism, causing his muscles to grow progressively stronger over time.) This was the reason behind his reaction when the police arrived that day. Despite his lingering fear, I expressed my concern to the police officer, emphasizing the need to ensure that such an incident would never recur. He assured me that he would take necessary measures to prevent it from happening again.

After several sleepless nights, my life finally returned to normal. Years passed, and the man who had been haunting me never returned. Until, one year ago, to be precise. At that time, my parents had moved out. I had purchased their house and still reside there to this day. I was enjoying my morning coffee on the patio when I noticed a random man stopping on the road by my fence. He simply stood there, staring at me. I looked at him and gave him a nod. Suddenly, I heard the high-pitched noises. “Oh my goodness, it’s him!” His hair had turned gray, but the high-pitched sounds made me realize something. My heart started racing, and I instantly recalled the reason for his return. I realized he had managed to escape once again. Because I managed to keep my composure a bit longer than when I was nine, I began to feel a sense of regret for the man. Sixteen years later, he was back, searching for his mother. I decided to cautiously ask him if he wanted to come down to the patio. He immediately jumped the fence. I couldn’t help but think he would knock me out like he had done to that police officer. Fortunately, he didn’t. Instead, he smiled. He looked at me and smiled.

I offered him a seat, but he didn’t respond. I invited him inside, but he started laughing. We went inside, and his face lit up with pure joy. He was finally home. It reminded him of the life he had with his mother. It almost brought tears to my eyes. Suddenly, he sat down on my couch, turned on my TV, and immediately switched to the cartoons. I observed him for a while. He was completely engrossed in the cartoons. I wanted him to fully enjoy the moment, so I didn’t say anything to him. I realized I had to call the facility to inform them of his presence. The caretakers arrived ten minutes later. After much persuasion, he got up, crying, and they took him back to the facility. I called the facility two days later. We made a deal.

Tom, a former resident of my patio, has become a cherished friend. Every Sunday since his return, Tom and his caregivers visit me to enjoy watching cartoons together. This activity has become the highlight of his week, and it brings immense joy to me. For several years, I had avoided meeting Tom due to his habit of eating from the ashtray on my patio. However, my perspective has shifted, and I now eagerly anticipate our weekly gatherings to watch cartoons and strengthen our friendship.
