Hi my name is tyler, I had always wanted a pet canary. They were small, colorful, and cheerful creatures that I thought would brighten up my apartment. So, when I saw an ad online for a canary for sale, I jumped at the opportunity.

I arranged to meet the seller at a local pet store, and when I arrived, I was greeted by a scruffy looking man who introduced himself as Joe. He told me that he had found the canary in his backyard and that it had been singing beautifully for him. I was a bit skeptical, but I figured that if the canary was as lovely as he claimed, it would be worth it. So, I handed over the money and took the small cage that contained the canary.

As soon as I got home, I set the cage on my kitchen counter and opened the door to let the canary out. It hopped out onto the counter and began to sing a beautiful song. I was enraptured by the sound and couldn't believe my luck at finding such a talented bird. However, as the days went on, I started to notice strange things happening in my apartment. My possessions would go missing, only to turn up in strange places. The canary seemed to always be watching me, even when it was asleep in its cage.

I began to feel uneasy and decided to do some research on canaries. That's when I stumbled upon a legend about skin walkers. According to the legend, a skin walker is a person who can transform into an animal, and it is believed that they can take on the form of any animal they choose.

I couldn't believe what I was reading. Could it be that my beloved canary was actually a skin walker? The more I thought about it, the more it seemed to make sense. The strange occurrences in my apartment, the canary's constant watchfulness - it all fit together.

I decided to confront the canary, hoping to get some answers. I approached its cage and asked, "Are you a skin walker?" To my surprise, the canary didn't deny it. Instead, it nodded its head and said, "Yes, I am a skin walker. And I've been watching you for a long time."

I was terrified and didn't know what to do. How could I have unknowingly brought a skin walker into my home? I didn't want to hurt the canary, but I couldn't let it stay with me either. I decided to try and find a way to reverse the transformation and turn the canary back into a human. I scoured the internet for any information that could help me, but I couldn't find anything.

Finally, in desperation, I turned to a local medicine man for help. He listened to my story and told me that the only way to reverse the transformation was to perform a special ceremony.

I agreed to do anything to help the canary, and so we set to work preparing for the ceremony. We gathered all the necessary ingredients and performed the ritual at midnight on a full moon.

As the ceremony came to an end, the canary began to transform. Its feathers fell away, and a young woman appeared in its place. She was crying and begged for my forgiveness.

It turned out that the woman was a victim of a curse, and the canary was the only form she could take. She had been stuck in that form for years, unable to escape or reveal her true identity.

I was relieved that we had been able to help her, and I vowed to always be more careful about what I brought into my home. From now on
