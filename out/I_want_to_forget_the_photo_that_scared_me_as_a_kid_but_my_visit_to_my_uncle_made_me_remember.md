I sometimes think about a photo I saw when I was a kid—a photo that used to terrify me. I can't quite remember what was in it anymore. But the fear it stirred in me was so real, so sharp, that even now, years later, a flicker of unease returns whenever I try to recall it. It's strange how something you can't even picture can still haunt you.

One rainy afternoon, I visited my Uncle Ryan, who still lived alone at 42 in the same house he’d grown up in. The place had a quiet, museum-like stillness to it, full of untouched memories. I remembered hearing from our family about how his teenage girlfriend, Elise, had drowned during a summer trip when they were just seventeen. He never really dated anyone seriously after that. As we sat in his living room, sipping tea under the soft hum of a table lamp, I caught sight of an old photo album on the shelf. A chill passed through me, sudden and inexplicable. Something about the album tugged at a deep, buried fear—like the feeling I got when I try to remember that photo from my childhood. It's not my Uncle's girlfriend that was in the creepy photo wasn't it? I mean his girlfriend looked sweet and charming.


As we finished our tea, Uncle stood up and carefully cut a tiny slice of the lemon cake we were eating. He placed it gently on a small floral plate, then opened the fridge and set it on the top shelf, right beside an old glass jar with dried roses inside. I watched, puzzled. “Saving some for later?” I asked lightly. Uncle smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “It’s for Elise,” he said softly. “She always loved lemon cake. I like to leave her a little something, just in case she visits.” His voice held no irony, just quiet conviction. I felt a strange tightness in my chest, and that old, forgotten fear stirred again—like something just out of sight was beginning to step closer.

I stood and stretched. “Mind if I look around? I haven’t seen the house for years,” I said, forcing a casual tone. Uncle nodded, gesturing vaguely down the hallway. “Of course. Go ahead."

I stepped into one of the newly painted rooms—a quiet, softly lit space with pale green walls and a fresh scent from the polished floorboards.

I wandered toward the window. As I looked out, my breath caught in my throat. Someone quickly showed up in front of me from outside the window. Its head tilted slightly, and it was smiling. But there was something wrong with the smile. It was too wide, too fixed, like it didn’t belong to a living person. I blinked, and in that split second, the figure was gone. I backed away from the window quickly, heart thudding.

What makes it more disturbing was the fact that I'm in the second floor.

I hurried back to the living room, trying to keep my voice steady. “Uncle I just remembered I-I’ve got to head out. I t-totally lost track of time.”

Uncle looked up from his chair, surprised and a little hurt. “Already? You just got here. Stay for dinner, at least. I was going to make Elise’s favorite stew.”

That name again. My skin prickled. “Next time, I promise,” I said, grabbing my bag and slipping on my coat with shaky hands.

A week passed, and the image of the smiling figure refused to leave my mind. Sleep came in fits, my dreams flickering with half-formed faces and waterlogged whispers. Eventually, I gave in to the pull of the past and called my mom one quiet evening.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual. “Do you remember that old maroon suitcase? The one that had Uncle Ryan's photos and sketches?”

There was a pause on the other end. “That thing? It’s in the attic, I think. Why?”

“I just... want to look at something." My mom sighed, a soft rustle of worry in her voice. “That suitcase contains lots of valuable stuffs of your uncle. Just handle it with care." I promised her I'll be careful with it.

It was time to face whatever had been waiting in the dark corners of my memory.

The attic smelled of dust and old wood, thick with the weight of forgotten years. I found the maroon suitcase tucked behind a stack of broken displays, dusty chest, and yellowed ripped magazines. My hands trembled slightly as I unlatched it, the metal clicks echoing in the stillness.

Inside, the familiar scent of paper and charcoal greeted me. I sifted through them slowly, cautiously, until my fingers paused on a worn piece of cardstock tucked between two pages of a sketchpad.

There it was.

The photo.

At first glance, it looked innocent—an old black-and-white snapshot of my uncle’s backyard, taken from a window. But as I adjusted my eyes, I saw it. In the far corner of the image, half-concealed in the shadows near the fence, was the same smiling woman I saw from the guest room window. Elise. The grotesque rotting drowned face of Elise.

My breath caught, but I didn’t look away. I turned the page in the sketchbook next to it, and my heart thudded loud in my chest. It was one of uncle’s drawings—rough, frantic lines in heavy pencil. A woman with a drowned, sunken face. But what made me gasp was her neck, it's long and impossibly stretched reaching up along the side of a house, her face peeking through the second-story window. Looking like a pale snake dipped in black mud.

I suddenly understood: the fear I carried since childhood wasn’t just from the photo. It was from seeing that face once before—through the very same window when I was just a little girl. Elise had been watching over us.
