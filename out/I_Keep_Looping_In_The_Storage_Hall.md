Hey, sorry if this isn't grammatically correct or written well at all, I'm gonna try to be as clear but hasteful when I explain this story because I just want help and don't have time to check this thing for grammar. To start, let me explain how I got where I am right now.

So I remember what month it is as of releasing this. It's July, and of 2024. On the day this started I know that I woke up some time around 11:30 Pm Ish. I had work on this day, I work at Weis markets, a smallish supermarket. I got to work at 5:00 pm and did what I normally do there. At 7:19 I entered the back to grab some boxes for stocking the shelves. I grabbed what I wanted and then walked down the hall to the other end of the back. When I turned the corner to leave through the other set of doors I ended up back at the other end of the hall. It felt completely natural though, I hadn't felt like I moved nor did I like to blink and end up somewhere else, I was just there.

I had spent a good few hours just attempting to go through the hall to get out… and a little too long just kinda thinking. But after my Deserved time to be terrified I started trying to be rational. 

Pretty much everything seems normal here except the fact that it loops. I have tried going out many different ways but none of them seem to work. There's some side doors that I tried to leave through, and an emergency fire exit, but they were all locked. The windows that look back out into the store show the store with its lights off. That can't be true though because the lights in the hall are on and they are always turned off first when we close. I didn't say everything I've tried and done because I want to get this out ASAP.

I do have access to an office and our freezers though. Thankfully the office has a microwave so I can warm the food from the store's stock.

I've been here for what I can guess is 3 days. The only reason I'm not sure of this stuff is that the time on my watch and my phone are frozen at 7:19. The date my phone reads is October 17th 1989. The reason I have not contacted anyone is because I have no service on my phone. 

The way I got this out here is by using the computer in the office I can access. Using the computer I created a guest account and am able to access an old browser. This computer is old and I cant download anything on it due to a block by “management” so i can't access any of my google accounts to message people I know.  

If anyone has any ideas or questions I'm more than open to answering and/or trying things. 

Thank you for listening and helping and it is funny to me that I'm asking for help here… or at least it would be funny if it wasn't terrifying.
