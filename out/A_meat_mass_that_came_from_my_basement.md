I moved into a beautiful house with my girlfriend recently. It had literally perfect surroundings and friendly neighbors; it was a cozy place in general. My friend Liam lived in the next building, so we could hang out more than we used to before, and all those things made me the happiest person in the world.

The first week was surprising nice; the more time I spent in the house, the more I loved it. About eight days after moving in, I was watching television with my wife. It was late at night, and the only  
light in the entire room was coming from the TV screen. For a second, I thought I saw the basement door open, but when I looked in that direction, everything  
was normal, and I didn't think much about it. The next day I heard horrible coughing from the kitchen, and when I rushed to see what was happening, my wife was lying on the ground. Something that looked like a fly flew out of her throat and started growing to transform into a disgusting mass, looking like it  
was made of meat. I couldn't help but just watch as it swallows her body, becoming even bigger, and soaks into the ground, leaving a pink stain on the carpet.

*What the fuck just happened? A fly transforming*  
*into a meat mass, swallowing my wife, and just...* 

*Dissapearing?*

  
From that time on, I kept seeing the meat mass, or whatever this piece of shit was. Once I opened a cupboard just to see this thing inside, I quickly closed and reopened it. It was empty. I cut off all my friends, including Liam. He kept asking if I was okay and what was happening. I couldn't explain anything to him, and I couldn't stop questioning my sanity. I started having nightmares about my wife. I dreamed about her being  
swallowed by the mass all over and over again. 

It hurt. It hurt so bad. One day I wanted to turn on the tap, and instead of water, there was something like a liquid meat mass running. I closed it, then just fell to the ground and started sobbing.  
Why was this happening? Maybe there was something wrong with me; maybe the meat  
mass was just a piece of my imagination?

Maybe the meat mass wasn't bad? Maybe I didn't  
have to fear it?

*I don't have to fear the meat mass.*

The next day, I stepped into the bathroom. There it was, a bath filled with the meat mass. It got up and started crawling towards me. I backed off and walked out of the bathroom, the mass following me,  
kind of like it was chasing me but being way too slow. I panicked, ran to the kitchen, and grabbed a knife. The  mass was slowly coming in my direction, and I pointed a knife at it with my hand shaking. I watched it get closer and closer in fear, but then I remembered something. I suddenly felt more relaxed.

*I don't have to fear the meat mass.*

No, silly. I don't have to fear the meat mass.  
I don't really have to.

I dropped the knife and started slowly walking up to the mass. I didn't really have to worry about it anymore. I felt so good and calm, getting close to the thing I wasn't really afraid of anymore. *I don't have to fear the meat mass.* I could feel the cold mix of guts and muscles on my skin. I could feel it being wrapped around my body. I fell, but surprising enough, I didn't even touch the floor. I was now lying in a comfortable cocoon,  
feeling it wrap itself around my body.

*I don't have to fear you*,  
I whispered with a smile as the meat mass covered my body, making it hard for me to breathe. The second I realized it wasn't a dream, I wanted to get out. I started panicking. The mass covered my face, trapping me and making me a part of itself.
