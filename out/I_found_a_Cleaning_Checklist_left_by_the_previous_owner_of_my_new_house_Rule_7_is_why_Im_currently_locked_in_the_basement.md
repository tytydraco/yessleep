​I moved into my new place in the suburbs of Portland just two weeks ago. The house was a steal—an old Victorian farmhouse with high ceilings and a price tag that felt almost criminal. The realtor told me the previous owner, Margaret, had moved into assisted living and just wanted the place taken care of.
​Yesterday, while I was pulling out the refrigerator to clean years of accumulated dust, I found a yellowed, crinkled piece of paper. It was a "Weekly Cleaning Checklist" written in shaky, elegant cursive. At first, I laughed at how meticulous the old lady was, but my blood ran cold as I read past the chores.
​The list read:

1)​Mondays: Scrub the kitchen floor with heavy-duty bleach. The smell of blood attracts them.

2)​Never open the curtains in the master bedroom after 9:00 PM, no matter how persistent the tapping on the glass becomes.

3)​If you find the basement door standing open in the morning, do not close it. Leave it as is and apologize out loud.

4)​"He" likes to sit in the rocking chair in the living room. If you see it moving on its own, leave the room immediately. Do not look back.

5)​Make sure every mirror on the second floor is covered before you go to bed.

6)​If you hear my voice (Margaret) calling you from the kitchen, remember… I am not there.

7)​If the lights go out suddenly and stay out, run to the basement. Lock the bolt from the inside. Do not open for anyone claiming to be the "electrician" or the "police." Wait until you hear the birds chirping outside.

​I dismissed it as the ramblings of a woman suffering from dementia. I tossed the paper in the trash and went to bed. But at 3:14 AM, I woke up to a rhythmic creak... creak... creak... coming from the living room.

​I crept down the stairs, my heart hammering against my ribs. There, in the pale moonlight, the rocking chair was swaying violently—back and forth, as if someone was sitting in it, struggling to stand up. I remembered Rule #4. I froze. Then, a voice drifted from the kitchen—a soft, warm, grandmotherly voice.

​"Michael? Are you awake, dear? Come, I’ve made you some tea."

​It was Margaret’s voice. But Margaret is in a nursing home miles away.

​Suddenly, every light in the house flickered and died. A darkness so thick it felt heavy settled over everything. I remembered Rule #7. I bolted, stumbling over furniture and bruising my shoulder against the doorframe, until I reached the basement. I threw myself inside and slammed the deadbolt home.

​I’m sitting here now, typing this on my phone with 4% battery left. There is a heavy, rhythmic pounding on the basement door.
​"Michael! Open up! It’s the police! We got a report of a break-in!"

​The voice sounds so real. I can see the beams of their flashlights cutting through the gap under the door. But I don’t hear any sirens outside. I don’t hear any tires on the gravel. And I definitely don't hear any birds.
​I’m terrified. What if Rule #7 was the trap? What if "He" is in here with me, and not out there?

​I’m going to wait for the dawn. If I don't update this post by tomorrow... please, for the love of God, stay away from 14 Blackwood Lane.
