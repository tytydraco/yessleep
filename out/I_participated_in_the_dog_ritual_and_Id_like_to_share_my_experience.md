Hello, my name is Austin and I have a very strange family tradition, matter of fact it’s more of a right of passage for my family according to my father it’s been passed down family member to family member for as long as he remembers and i recently came of age to be passed down the rules and to participate in the ritual. I wanted to share my experience, anyways a little about my situation I just turned 16 a month ago, one night I was approached by my father and he gave me a book not your traditional book more like a old school note pad. I asked him what it is and he said it was time to participate in the ritual and to perform it exactly how he written it out. I thought it was a joke at first and kinda forgot about it until about 9 pm last night I notice everyone in my house was gone and there was a note on the kitchen table saying they went to a near by hotel until my father  was notified the ritual was done.  So I found the note pad and looked at the first step

(step 1 kill the dog) I had to do a double take what kind of sick joke is this I called my father and told him I was disgusted what he asked me to do after a long pause my father said it needs done or all of us including my baby sister will die. The tone of my dads voice was very serious and I somehow knew this was real so I proceeded. I walked over to snuggles my golden lab my dad gifted me when I turned 5 for my birthday I grab snuggles by the neck and squeezed I squeezed so hard the yelping got softer and softer until it was over. I picked up the rules with tears running down my face I looked at step number 2:

 ( lock the dog’s corpse in the basement) crying even harder I picked up snuggles and in one big motion I picked him up and rolled him down the basement stairs locking the door behind me. Step 3:( use your blood to draw a cross on the door the crucifixion is done now the hunt begins)  I draw a crude cross with my blood using a kitchen knife and then it went dark I woke up in my basement it was dark and I was confused I look down and barely can make out the 4th step: 

( survive to spread) I was confused, then out of the darkness a snarling dog approached me it looked like snuggles but it was unnaturally big it was almost like it’s flesh was peeling off it’s body, but the most disturbing part was the creature had a Big smile a-crossed it’s face with human like teeth. Then snuggles spoke “share my face and ritual to the world let me hunt, if there is no prey I’ll be force to hunt you” I agreed and snuggles disappeared into the shadows so dear reader I’m sorry but now your apart of the hunt it’s hard to say who is being hunted currently but if you read this you’ll be hunted in due time. All i know is the more people who know about the ritual the further you are pushed down the prey list. So what better way then posting this on a forum for thousands of people to see. Good luck tell snuggles im sorry and I’m sorry for spreading this out side my family to your family and loved ones,also if your family pet or a random stray animal starts to smile at you run away your being hunted. 

Regards,
Austin
