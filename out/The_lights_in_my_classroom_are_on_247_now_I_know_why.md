It was dark that night, and my parents allowed me to stay outside till midnight, the date was October 15th 2023 and we had no school tomorrow so I went to hang out with my friends, bunch of 14-year-olds smoking as much as we can. I bought a cigarette pack earlier that evening and by the end of the night, we finished it. But not because we are bunch of narcs, it’s because of what we saw. What we saw in room 604. 

At around 9:30 PM we accompanied our friend on his way back home, and he lives right in front of our school. Here is something about our school, in “\*\*\*\*\*\*” school there are 5 main buildings: science building, secretary building, and the building of grades 7-9. But at grade 9’s building, sits room 604, my classroom, and for some odd reason, the lights are always on, no matter the day, the time, the weather, none. Our classroom faces the street so we could see the light where we were, but when I looked at the classroom window, I froze for a second, wiped my eyes and realized I’m not dreaming, it was a shadow, a tall and dark shadow, it was so tall the shadow casted on the celling a little bit, I was creeped and curious. I notified my friends, Mike, Bryan, and Austin; Oh forgot to introduce myself, I’m Ben. We were all creeped out and curious, and the fact that the school’s gate was open, like it was inviting us to come and check out whatever the hell was in there, didn't help. We entered the school, the allergenics banner welcomed us. Oddly, all the lights are off, I’ve been at school in the evening, and the lights are automatically turned on at night, but tonight, nothing was on. When we approached, I felt like something was watching from above, but not God, something dark. That feeling quickly went away as we entered the 9th grade building. We didn’t care about getting caught in the cameras, all we wanted to know is *why. The lights. Are. On. 24/7*.

And we thought if there was anything dangerous, we could just stab it. Look I always go out with a small knife, because who know who will face. We were approaching it, Room 604. I volunteered to open the door because everyone else are cowards, but when I went to open the door, I grabbed the handle and it was freezing, so cold I dropped the handle like a burning coal. So, I used my jacket to open it, the door opened and the smell of rotten flesh attacked my nose.

But the moment all of us entered the room, all the lights turned off in an instant. It was silent for a moment, but all of a sudden, we heard a terrifying gargling sound, we all turned to the origin, and froze, teeth, long and knife-like sharp teeth, moonlight spilling from the window displayed the teeth in a sad face shape, we are all blinking and slapping ourselves to wake up incase this is a dream, and when I opened my eyes, they were still there and even worse, the teeth started to move towards us. We were all frozen from fear, as the lights turned on like spotlights clearing the way for the teeth, we saw the rest of this………. Creature, a tall creature, so tall it reached the celling, its skin was rotten and unhuman like white skin, so white it reflected the light from above, long rotten limbs carried him around the room, his blood-colored eyes are hovering above his wide agape mouth with those huge teeth.

He reached us and stared right into our souls; it was like the devil himself is looking at us. Right when he reached to Austin with his rotten hand, I managed to break the paralyses, and ran for my life and left my friends there. I don’t know what he did to them, but I know it was horrible by the blood curling screams of Austin. I smoked the rest of the cigarettes, all 7 of them, I was so stoned from all the Nicotine I almost got ran over when didn’t wait at the crosswalk, to be honest, too bad I wasn’t run over.

 After I’m done writing this, I will jump off my balcony to what ever is on the other side. I’m the only one who knows what happened there, the only one who knows what happened to Bryan, Mike and Austin, the one who knows what is in room 604 and the only one who knows why the lights in my classroom are on 24/7.
