Before I begin, I should let you know that the stories I’m writing are not for the faint of heart, or for the squeamish. As I type this, bottle of bourbon in hand, booze soaked whiskers covering my face, I should let you know the year is 2009. I don't now when, or if I'll ever tell anyone, or show them the story. Well, anyone else at least. I believe that’s enough exposition to preface this.



I suppose I should start with a name. My name. My name is Jeremy, at least that’s what my shrink told me to say my name was, for my protection, so I can’t say much else for now regarding my identity. Where to start, oh, where to start? I suppose I should start by stating we were just dumb. Well, maybe dumb isn’t the correct wording. Ignorant is more apt to what we were. Ignorance is bliss, after all.



It started on a brisk, sunny day in mid-October of 1986 at just thirteen years old, I was in sixth grade, and Mr. Stephens, my science teacher, gathered the class around for our weekly group huddle, as he called it. 



“Alright class! I have some very exciting news for you all!” 



Mr. Stephens chirped, as he usually did, his bubbly personality not unusual to any of us. The class perked up, a slight breeze rattling the “Hang in there!” and “Math is rad!” posters that lined the wall.



“What is it?”



A girl named Jennifer asked inquisitively. Mr. Stephens smiled, his Cheshire Cat like grin causing the dozen or so of us in the class that day to join in with him in his elation, a few kids whispering, pondering as to what may be coming.



“Well, we have a new friend joining us today! He’s a little shy, everyone give a warm welcome to our newest student, Charlie!”



The class erupted into a roaring cacophony of cheers, including myself, as a meek, strawberry blonde haired boy walked into the room, hiding his tomato colored face in his mothers side. His mother smiled, waving to the classroom, as Mr. Stephens motioned for us to quiet down, Charlie's mother cleared her throat, beaming at us all before speaking.



“Hello children! Charlie and I just moved to town, he’s a little shy, so if you would please be patient with him as he adjusts, I think he’ll make lots of new friends here!”



I could see dried up tears on the boys face as he turned to us, fear in his eyes as he turned back into his mothers side, a muffled voice trembling.



“I want to go home.”



Was all that came from the boy, a feeling of pity washed over my body. I had just moved to Wellspring the year before, and was just as timid as he was right now. His mother winced, her face turning to a look of sorrow, sullen as Charlie recessed deeper into his mother, wrinkling the maroon sweater she was wearing, before speaking again.



“Charlie…this is home now.”



He sniffled and pouted, letting go of his mother reluctantly before sitting down next to me on the floor. I gave him a smile, eliciting a small chuckle from him, his lip slightly curling on his lips. I shot him a puzzled look before looking down and grinning, realizing what he was laughing at. I burst out laughing with him, causing an eruption of laughter to spread throughout the class. Charlies tears of fear turned to tears of laughter, streaming down his face before asking me:



“Did your mom dress you today? I think she made a mistake!” The class erupted in laughter as my backwards shirt began to get noticed.



“My name is Jeremy, want to be friends?”



“Sure!”



Charlie shouted, Mr. Stephens and Charlies mother letting out a sigh of relief as we hugged, the rest of the class buzzed with excitement, talking to one another.



“So uh, do you like Transformers?”



Asked Charlie, a toothy grin on my face as I walked over to my designated spot and pulled out my Optimus Prime lunchbox. Charlie looked over with pure excitement, showing me his identical lunchbox. 



The day went on as usual, we had pizza for lunch. I can still remember that bland, tasteless rectangular slab from Wellspring Junior High. In fact, looking back on it, I kind of miss it. After lunch we worked on our times tables, multiplication. Things suddenly shifted gears around 12:45 that afternoon.



The class ground to a halt, going silent as the room went dark, losing electricity it seemed, as a booming echo of what sounded like a scream came from the woods outside the window. Mr. Wells, our math teachers usual sunny disposition was wiped from his face as he looked in abject horror at the window, running over to close the blinds so no one would see. I saw though, and the look of terror in Charlies eyes, and the stench of urine told me that he had seen it too. An emaciated man with a sack over his head and hands tied behind his back had ran from the forest screaming before collapsing on the ground, covered in welts and burns, a strange chain link fence looking symbol carved into his chest, coagulated blood seeping around the area. We both stared blankly at the spot where it happened, just a drab, orange curtain blocking everyone else from the view. The loudspeaker overhead chiming in with a voice from the Mrs. Hollace, the principal.



“LOCK THE DOORS IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT LET ANYONE IN OR OUT OF THE BUILDING UNTIL POLICE ARRIVE.”



Charlie began to cry again, as did I, embracing him in a hug, Mr. Wells looking fearful, running over to us, as we seemed to be the only ones crying, the rest of the class awash with confusion instead.



“Are you ok?”



He asked. Both of us looked at each other wide eyed, in a look that said “Don’t let him know that we saw, keep it secret.”



If I had known what would happen a little over a decade later, I wouldn’t have agreed to be friends with Charlie. Hell, I wish I never met him. I wish he went to another school, or moved to another town, even if we did end up best friends. I wish I had told someone, ANYONE else what we saw that day. 



I’m getting dreary, my eyes keep drooping as I recount this, maybe the booze is getting to me. So I’ll split this up into parts, chapters if you will. I don't know what will happen to me for even speaking of that fucking town, nor do I care. I guess that’s why I have to keep my mouth shut about my identity. I probably should keep my mouth shut about the rest of it too, but the truth needs to be out there. One thing I know for certain though is:



That was the first victim I saw of the Wellspring Furnace, but unfortunately not the last.
