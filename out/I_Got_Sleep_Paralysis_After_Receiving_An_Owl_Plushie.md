If I recall correctly, this happened almost 9 years ago when I was 14.

On Christmas day at my dad’s house, one of the gifts I received from him was this snowy owl stuffed animal/plushie. Keep in mind, it wasn’t one of those old/vintage stuffed animals that you’d assume it’d be. It was a round and circular beanie boo that’s a bit bigger than a basketball. 
(I will include a photo of it [here](https://imgur.com/a/sleep-paralysis-owl-ZeSqJzx) since I still have it with me after all these years).

During that time, I always found owls to be cute, fascinating creatures. It’s not like it was my favourite animal or anything but I had love for all creatures. So I happily took it to my bed to be with my other plushies.

Fast forward (I think) about 2-3 nights, I experience sleep paralysis for the first time. I’m thankful for being a big fan of “dark/creepy” internet stuff since a young age because I knew from the stories/experiences I’ve read, to never open your eyes when it happens. I waited it out and not too long after, I came to again and could control my body.

I wasn’t terribly disturbed after the occurrence since it was a very short duration of paralysis and I didn’t experience any creepy things while it happened. I went back to bed and I was fine.

The next 2 nights, I have the same thing happen but both of them wake me up from deep sleep before starting the sleep paralysis (the first was me just starting to go to sleep before feeling it happen).

Al though, I still don’t experience anything creepy, just temporary paralysis that doesn’t last long.

After those days, I went back to my moms (I lived 50/50 at both of my parents places, usually in duration of 3 days at one place then 4 at the other), but I never had the sleep paralysis occur at my mom’s.

When I went back to my dads, I experienced the paralysis all over again for about 2 more nights (it was only once per night and still kept the short duration).

But after those 2 nights, I experienced a different incident unlike all the others, which led me to believing it’s the owl.

After finishing school for the day, I took my  usual 30min bus ride back to my dads where I’d be alone for a few hours (my brother stayed in town that day and my dad was still at work). Inside the house, sunlight beamed brightly through the windows and skylight making the whole house as bright as day. I wasn’t sure with what I was gonna do for the next couple hours, so instead of aimlessly wandering around the house to decide on something, I grabbed my Snowy Owl Plush from my bedroom and decided to lay on the couch for a couple minutes so I could rest my legs while I came to a decision.

Within 1 or 2 seconds after laying down and closing my eyes (like I legit JUST GOT ONTO THE COUCH) I was paralyzed. This time it was different though cuz it was so instantaneous and it was also midday in bright daylight unlike the other times at night.

I mean sure the other times were a little spooky, but this time I felt real fear. I was fully awake 5 seconds before with complete control of my body and now I’m paralyzed?

Then, I heard what sounded like someone slowly walking back and forth a couple feet in front of me along with this slow, raspy breathing. Since it was so light in the house, I could see what looked like a shadow moving through my eyelids (I was sure as hell not opening them until it was over). The worst part was when the breathing got closer and went right up to my face as if someone leaned their face a couple inches from mine. I could feel the slow raspy breathing lightly blowing against my cheek and the light I saw through my eyelids went dark as if someone was infront, blocking the light from my eyes.

I couldn’t tell you how long it lasted but it felt like 3-5 minutes straight. The breathing slowly leaned out away from me, then I heard 2 or 3 steps walk away. 

As soon as the steps were gone, I was back to being able to move my body. Instantly, I picked up my Snowy Owl Plushie and said out loud “Were you the one causing this the whole time?” Then stashed it in my upper closet shelf. 

Since then, I’ve never experienced another sleep paralysis episode and I always keep that plushie in a separate space.

-I should also add that about 3 or 4 years ago (I lived on my own at this point), my mom came to visit and was staying in the guest room at my place for the week (she moved out of town about a year prior).
I kind of forgotten about the owl plushie in general since after keeping it in a separate space, I’ve had nothing happen. During that time though, that space was on the floor near the bed in the guest room.
I only remembered it was left there when I asked my mom the next morning how she slept.

When I asked her, she was still half asleep; her eyes barely open, and was walking down the hall to the bathroom. She tiredly mumbled back to me “I had so many nightmares” with an almost disturbed tone in her voice, so I gave her a hug and asked if she wanted to talk about it. 

Eyes still closed from being half asleep, she furrowed her brows in thought, taking a couple seconds to try and recall her nightmares. She then made a nervous whine/groan (sort of like the one you’d make when in pain); as if the thought was too painful to recall, then walked straight into the bathroom saying nothing else.

This is when I remembered that the owl plushie was beside the bed on the guest room floor, making me promptly move it into another room while she was still in the bathroom. I then went back to the living room to continue watching YouTube. Shortly afterwards, she came out of the bathroom still half asleep, and walked straight back to bed. 

Later on during the day; around mid-late afternoon, I decided to bring it up again and ask her what happened in the nightmares she had earlier (seeing as she was fully awake at that point and has probably calmed down since then).
Strangely enough though, she replied with “what nightmares?”, then proceeded to tell me she had no memory of having any nightmares, let alone even talking to me that morning.-

(I totally underestimated how long it’d take to write out personal stories on Reddit my GOD. I’ve told my experience over and over verbally, but actually having to write it out was a much different experience :’) mad respect to all you writers out there haha)
