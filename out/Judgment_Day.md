I’m a defense attorney, but this story isn’t about my job. It’s about the day my client Christina completely butchered her carefully-drafted defense by stabbing me in the stomach.

As I desperately tried to keep my intestines inside, I wished good luck onto my predecessor. Getting Chris out of this one would be pretty damn hard. Even though, I thought, it wasn’t  *technically* sufficient evidence. Just cause Christina had stabbed me didn’t *necessarily* mean she had stabbed all those others as well.

Then, my world got dark.

 

The next thing I remember is my feet feeling soft. Very soft. I was standing on a cloud. Weird. I stared at my hands. They were clean. No guts. The world was bright. And there were people in front of me. And behind me. I was in some kind of line. As it moved forward, I figured out three things: 

1. I was probably dead. 

2. I was in line to get into heaven. 

3. While everyone else was wearing some type of nightgown, I was still in my pantsuit.

As I got closer and closer to the pearly gates, more and more wrinkles appeared on the face of the angel guarding them. When the girl in front of me stepped up to him, he only took one single look at her, his expression full of disdain.

“Hell.”

“Wait”, the girl shook her head, “wait, wait, wait. I didn’t mean to kill them.”

I frowned. Something about that voice seemed familiar.

“I’m sorry”, she said, “I’m sorry. I just get so angry sometimes. But I… I wanted to be better. I swear. And I…”

I took a step forward. “Christina?”

The angel looked up. The disdain on his face turned into annoyance. “Oh Lord, why are *you* here? Your time hasn’t come yet.”

I clicked my tongue. “Well, that’s unfortunate. But if you’ll excuse us, I’d like to talk with my client for a moment?”

He grumbled something incomprehensible.

Christina and I stepped aside. “What’s going on here?”, I asked, “this doesn’t add up. I died before you. Did you push past me in line or something?”, I tilted my head, “also, uhm, why did you stab me?”

Christina didn’t look at me. “Sorry”, she whispered, “I couldn’t face you. Sometimes, I just see red”, she took a deep breath, “But now that’s okay. Now, the police shot me and I get what I deserve”, she raised her voice, preparing herself to step forward. “I’m ready.”

“Wait”, I pushed her behind me, “wait, stop. She doesn’t deserve eternal damnation. Listen. One of the main ideas behind our justice system is rehabilitation. My client clearly regrets what she did, and she wants to do better. Don’t you have like a heaven-equivalent to prison? Community service? Purgatory?”

The angel blinked. “This is none of your business.”

“It is, literally”, I crossed my arms, “this woman is my client.”

The angel closed his eyes. “Defense attorney, right. I really hate you guys.”

“Doesn’t everyone deserve justice?”, I asked, “just as the Lord gives it to us?”

“You try to be like the Lord?”

I suddenly remembered that the angel was gonna judge *me* next. I forced myself to lower my gaze. “I just try to be kind. To be fair. To be a good person.”

He smiled at me. I suppressed a shudder. I hadn’t thought that it was possible for an angel to smile so sinisterly. It took all my strength not to jerk back.

“Do you wish to take on a second job here?”, the angel asked, “your time hasn’t come. You will return back to earth soon. But if you want, you can visit us at night. You can do what you do best: Defend. What do you think?”

“I… uhm”, I trailed off. Honestly, I didn’t really have the capacity to take on a night-job. Also, I was a lawyer. I  had a talent for smelling bullshit. And by the way the angel spoke… if I said yes, I wasn’t gonna get a salary. On the contrary, agreeing was gonna cost me. I didn’t know what. But it was gonna cost me.

The angel tilted his head. “Everyone deserves an attorney, right?”

I swallowed. “Right.”

“Good”, he made a little note in his book, “then go ahead. Defend her. But be aware, she isn’t going to hell for the murders. She has confessed and regretted those.”

“For what then?”, I asked.

“Adultery.”

Christina waved. “We were only married on paper by then.”

“Divorce.”

 “But I don’t regret that”, Christina said, “how could I? I was a danger for him. I loved him enough to let him go.”

“You could have worked on it.”

“I tried, I…”

*“Hell.”*

“Excuse me”, I said, “my client has acted in the best interests of her ex-husband. Her noble motives should be taken into consideration when…”, I stopped mid-sentence. A terrible feeling crept up inside of me. Suddenly, I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t do anything except writhe in agony as I saw the demons appeared.  So I just watched them drag Christina to hell.

“Next”, the angel said.

“Wait, you can’t…”, I stuttered, “Stop. Bring her back. I didn’t have time to… I couldn’t even defend her. You *have* to let me defend her.”

“I said next!”

The next woman walked up, a lovely lady with a huge sunburn.

“Did I die from gardening?”, she asked, “I’m sorry, that can’t be right. I know I sometimes forget to wear a hat, and my son *has* said it will be the end of me, but…”

“Hell”, the angel interrupted, “lesbian.”

“Objection!”, I yelled, “I… uh… she… I”, I felt my breath hitch and forced myself to swallow, “well. Your honor. First of all, this woman didn’t hurt a soul.”

The angel shrugged. “She is a woman who lay with another woman. Hell.”

“So why *the fuck* did you make her that way?”, I took a deep breath. Swearing probably wasn’t the best strategy. “How could her love be something sinful when it resulted in a beautiful, god-fearing, loving family? When it resulted in charity, in children, in a garden she grew?”

“She sinned, and she never regretted it. *Hell*.”

“What?”, I stared at him “you can’t…”

I froze. There was that feeling again. That terrible, helpless feeling. I cried softly as they dragged the woman down to eternal damnation. “Thank you for trying”, she whispered.

I stared at the place where she disappeared. I had failed her. I had failed my clients. I clenched my fists. Focus. Be what the angel hired you for. A defense attorney. Professional. Argumentative. Good under pressure. I felt myself calm down. I had trained for this.

A tug at my sleeve. A young girl, almost a child. “Can you help me?”, she asked, “I’m scared to talk to the angel because I made my baby go away. Do you think he will be mad at me?”

Tears were flooding down my cheek. I wondered if that meant rain on earth.

I couldn’t stop the crying, but I could still use my voice. So, I cleared my throat, re-arranged my blazer. Made sure my hair was in order. And smiled.

“Let’s find out, sweetie.”

 

“You’re awake!”

A happy voice. The first happy voice in a long, long time.

I was still crying. But now, someone was stroking my face, wiping the tears away. I recognized the smell of my partner. I opened my eyes and then, she was crying too.

“How long was I out?”, I asked.

“About three days”, she forced herself to smile, “was it a relaxing coma? The first time in a while you got that much sleep, huh?”

“It was terrible”, I said, “I had the weirdest nightmare.” Three days. Three days and hundreds of cases. I had lost all of them. Except… wait. I still had one real client. 

“What about Christina?”, I asked, “how is she doing?”

My wife bit her lip. “Honey, I uhm… I don’t know how… well… oh screw it. That bitch tried to stab you, so I’m just gonna say it. Christina is dead. The police shot her.”

I closed my eyes. It didn't stop the images. Hundreds of faces. Hundreds of women I hadn’t saved. Christina had been real. They had all been real.

“You know, her ex-husband picked up her remains”, my wife cleared her throat, “he said… he said he was sure Christina was sorry for stabbing you. She just got angry like that, sometimes.”

The beeping of monitors grew louder around me. Doctors and nurses rushed in. Everyone was freaking out, thinking I was gonna die… again. Like Christina. Christina was dead. Shot by police. Pretty damning evidence for once.

I forced myself to open my eyes again, to look at the one face that wasn’t dead, though it was just as damned as the others. My wife. There were lines in that face, lines from age and laughter. I touched her cheek, and my heartbeat calmed down.

“It’s okay love”, she said, “it’s okay. Christina is in a better place now.”

I forced myself to smile. “Let’s go home soon, yeah?”

 

It actually took a few weeks until they released me. The experience gave me a huge scar on my stomach and a new job.

Now, I’m a defense attorney at night as well. I have lines on my face now, too, lines of anger and pain. I wake up crying every morning. I try my best to prepare myself in the evenings. To be a professional, to guarantee a fair trial. But how can you win a fight when the laws weren't written for you? So far, I have lost 231118 cases. Divorces. Escaping abusive relationships. Adultery. Abortions. All while men who have done unspeakable things sneaked right past the gate, simply by claiming they regret it. I know that when my time comes, the demons will drag me down as well. I will suffer alongside all the people I have failed.

But every morning, right before I head out to work, I kiss my wife goodbye. And I cannot help it.

I cannot regret loving her.
