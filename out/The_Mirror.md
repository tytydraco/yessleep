A few months ago i was taking the usual walk around the lake of my town, which takes around 2 hours and leads also through some really nice neighborhoods aswell. I was listening to my classical music, drifting away in my thoughts and i was starting to relax after a long day while passing a house where something was drawing my attention. 

In the yard of this house there was a big mirror leaning onto a tree with the sign "free to take" taped onto it's front.

It was a really pretty mirror with the frame encased in black leather, in absolute flawless condition. I was looking at it and was asking myself why anybody would ever wanna get rid of that beautiful mirror and continued with my walk. 

But i could not get the mirror out of my head anymore. It would fit just perfectly into my apartment; the style, the shape and the size were just perfect and were calling for me that i should take it home!

So, after around half an hour later i turned around, i was now even jogging back to this house, and thank goodness, the mirror was still there! I picked it up and dragged the surprisingly heavy thing back home, where i even had the perfect spot for it on hand: right in my living room across the couch between two white dressers topped out with smooth and elegant, dark-brown walnut wood. 

I was really happy and could not believe my luck. I was searching exactly for something like that as decoration!

But after a while strange things were happening, now when i think of it afterwards... in the first few weeks i was always unconsciously looking at the mirror when i was passing it. Every single time. It was on the side of my living room, never directly in my path, but i always turned my head into it's direction and looked straight into the mirror when i was passing by.

Then, at some evenings, i was even sitting down in front of the mirror and just staring into it. 1, 2 or 3 minutes at first, which became often 5 or even 10 minutes or even more after a while. It was just such a pretty mirror and i could not stop looking into it, it had some draw to it that i could not explain and it let me drift off deeply into my thoughts and inner self.

But something was changing; inside of me, but also the energy/vibes of my apartment. It felt off, which I could not tell at first. 

One day my best friend was visiting me and he also had his dog with him. A beautiful, black and very friendly Labrador. She was very kind and wholesome and never started any trouble with any other dogs or humans; and she loved to cuddle, too! But at this day when she was entering my living room, she started to get afraid and tucked her tail away. 

When she passed the mirror, she suddenly started to growl at it. I never ever have heard her growling before, it really set my best friend and myself off. My best friend then asked where i got this mirror from, because he never saw it before and I told him that I found it for free on the street in another neighborhood. 

He said he did not like it and it felt off to him, aswell as the whole story. Such things usually only happen in horror movies and i should never ever have touched the mirror, rather bringing it home into my apartment!

And somehow he was right, i now also felt that something was off about this mirror and i got really cautious/afraid of it. I never looked at it again when passing it and i also never sat in front of it again, aswell.

Suddenly a few days later i started to get nightmares. People, or rather "Entities" were talking to me, following me around in my dreams. Often they were people from my past, my deceased Grandma or people from school or even my Ma and Aunt. But they were never truly like the real person i know/knew. Often i also did not see them directly in my dreams and they were just talking to me from behind, but i knew they were there and were watching over me.

When this voice/person was my Grandma in my dreams, i was especially happy, because i missed her so much. She died in 2020 cause of cancer and it was a pretty agonizing way for her to go. In my dreams I could talk to her and she always asked how i was doing. To see her again or even to hold her in my arms again was a very emotional experience. But something was a bit off; her face was always a bit blurry and she often would not answer my questions or talk to me incomprehensible or in changing tones.

After a while I realized that these were just dreams and one night, when i told my Grandma that this is just a dream and that she had died a few years ago and she was not real and just a memory anymore, things became uncomfortable.

She got really angry and screamed at me and the location, a previous apartment where i lived in my childhood with my Mum and my Grandma together, turned all of a sudden dark/cold and this dreamworld was cracking apart.

I was shaken by fear and suddenly somebody was calling my name louder and louder until i woke up in panic, drenched in sweat and shivering to the bone. I went up to go to the bathroom and at this night i felt very paranoid and like something was watching me. That was a really scary experience. 

It was awful, and now i was sure that i have indeed brought something else into my life when I was picking up that mirror and that i have to get rid of it ASAP! 

The next day I went to the mirror to pick it up when i was seeing everywhere black dust on the floor below of it. I was wiping my hand across the black leather frame and my whole hand was covered in this black dust, which had an awful smell of sulphur or burnt wood. When i picked it up a few weeks ago, this dust was definitely not there. No idea where this dust was coming from, so i went to the bathroom to get a wet towel to clean it up, before I threw the whole thing out.

But when I was entering the bathroom, suddenly there was this loud bump followed by a shattering noise ... the mirror tipped over and fell onto the floor, shattering into a dozen or so large, long and shimmering shards.

That was it; i picked up the frame and threw it into a container at the back of my house. But when picking up the last shards, one of them lacerated the back of my thumb and turned it open into a 2 inch long, gaping cut. I put a towel around of it and threw the shards in the trash bins outside, afterwards I tended to the cut with disinfectant and had to call my doctor, who sent me to the hospital for stitching up the finger.
What a mess. 

6 months are now past since i threw out the mirror and since i got the cut on my thumb. It took more than a month to heal and now i have a huge scar there as permanent memory for the rest of my life. Aswell as all the other horrible dreams/memories, aswell.

I really hope this mirror got shredded apart and nobody else had to deal with it anymore. The cute and friendly Dog of my best friend was also visiting me again and she was not afraid and did not growl at anything in my apartment anymore. And i also never had any nightmares of my family/friends or deceased Grandma anymore, thankfully. 

Never pick up any random furniture that you find for free in the streets. Who knows the backstory of this item.

You could maybe bring something else into your home with it, too.
