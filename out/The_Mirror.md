Most of my childhood memories are fuzzy, like old photos that got left out in the sun. But this one, this one’s sharp as a razor, lodged in me like a splinter that won’t budge. It was the summer of ’95 in a small Oklahoma town, the kind where the heat clung to your skin like damp cloth. Our house was a furnace, no air conditioning, just a rattling fan that pushed warm air around. At night, the cicadas screamed outside, and the greasy scent of hot asphalt seeped through open windows.

Ricky, my best friend, lived three blocks over. His mom, Karla, was the town’s open secret, jars of herbs lined her shelves, candles burned to stubs, tarot cards scattered like leaves. She called it witchcraft; others called it nonsense. I thought it was magnetic. She never hid it, leaning into the whispers with a sly smile.

That afternoon, Ricky and I roamed town to escape our stifling houses. We ended up at a garage sale, a sad sprawl of cardboard boxes and warped VHS tapes. That’s where I saw it, the mirror. It was taller than me, frame all gray and beat-up. The glass was weird too, the edges looked like smoke had gotten stuck inside it.  I traced my fingers along the surface: no dust, no grit, just a faint chill that didn’t belong in July.

“Five bucks,” the old woman running the sale muttered, barely looking up.

I paid, thinking Karla might use it for scrying, her cloudy crystal ball was a dud, she’d admitted. Dragging it home, sweat soaked my shirt, the mirror heavier than it looked. I meant to take it to her, but I never did.

That night, I propped it against a chair in my room, planning to haul it over tomorrow. The air smelled of dust and sweat as I sat on my bed, fanning myself with a dog-eared Sports Illustrated. I glanced at the mirror and froze.

My hair wasn’t mine.

I’d always had pale blond hair, so light kids called it “baby blond.” In the glass, it was copper red, like rust, like dried blood. Not a trick of the lamp’s yellow glow. Not a sunburn tint. Red, vivid, wrong.

I stood, mattress springs creaking. My reflection stayed seated, staring. Heart pounding, I leaned closer. The air near the mirror was cold, like a draft from nowhere. My reflection smiled, but not like me. Too wide. Like it was hungry for something.

I stumbled back, knees hitting the bed. The reflection tilted its head, watching me like a coyote sizing up prey. My neck prickled, sweat turning icy. I grabbed a blanket and threw it over the mirror, heart hammering as I crawled under my sheets.

That was the first night.

The next morning, the blanket was folded neatly on the chair. The mirror stood uncovered, glass gleaming. I checked my hair in the bathroom mirror, still blond, thank God. But when I returned, the reflection’s hair was red again, and its eyes were darker, bruised like it hadn’t slept in years.

I told myself it was the heat, dehydration, anything. I dragged the mirror to the garage, wedging it behind old paint cans. By evening, it was back in my room, leaning against the chair.

I didn’t tell anyone. Not Mom, not Ricky. Who’d believe a kid saying his mirror was wrong?

The reflection grew bolder. Sometimes it was me, but sharper, cheekbones too pronounced, smile too wide. Other times, it showed more.

One night, I woke to silence, the cicadas gone quiet. The hallway clock ticked like a hammer. In the mirror, Ricky lay at my reflection’s feet, a rope tight around his neck, lips blue, eyes glassy. His body swayed, as if freshly cut down. My reflection sat there cross-legged, tapping its knee like it was waiting for me to notice. Then it smiled, like it was showing off a prize.

“No,” I whispered, voice cracking. “No, no, no…”

The reflection grinned wider, eyes glinting.

Two days later, Karla found Ricky hanging from the clothesline pole in their backyard. The cops called it an accident. I knew better. The mirror had shown me.

Looking back, I should’ve told someone, but who the hell would believe me?

That morning, dirt caked my sneakers, the same red clay as Ricky’s yard. My palms ached, faint rope burns circling them. I scrubbed until my skin bled.

I went to Karla, desperate. Her house smelled of sage and wax, her eyes swollen from crying.

“Did Ricky ever say anything about a mirror?” I asked.

She shook her head. Then her gaze lingered on me. “Chris… your hair. It looks darker.”

I touched my scalp, heart dropping. In her bathroom mirror, my blond was intact, but at the roots, the color bled red. I laughed it off, muttered something about lighting, and fled.

The visions came faster. In the mirror I saw Karla, skin burned up, smoke rolling through the room. She wasn’t moving.  My uncle crushed beneath his own truck, blood pooling in the dirt.

I’d wake with ash under my nails, the stink of smoke on my shirt. Or grease staining my hands, motor oil under my fingernails. A week later, Karla’s house burned. Days after that, my uncle’s truck rolled over him. Both times, the mirror showed me first.

I tried smashing it. Took Dad’s hammer, swung until sparks flew. The hammerhead cracked. The mirror didn’t.

I tied myself to the bed at night. In the mornings, the knots were undone, my clothes filthy with ash or dirt. A neighbor told police they’d seen me wandering near Ricky’s yard. I swore I hadn’t. My mother stirred soup one evening, giving me that look only moms have.

“You’re not yourself lately, Chris.”

Her voice was soft, but it made me want to scream. I stared at her hands, steady on the spoon. In the mirror that night, those same hands were slick with blood.

I dug into the mirror’s past. The library’s microfilm turned up a clipping: a 1920s cult, members vanishing after “rituals with a cursed glass.” The photo showed my mirror; frame carved with symbols that seemed to shift if I stared too long.

“Careful with old stories, kid,” the librarian said.

Two days later, her obituary ran. Heart attack, they said. The mirror had shown me her first, clutching her chest while my reflection laughed.

I stopped eating. Food rotted on my plate. I scratched my arms raw. My nose bled constantly, sheets stained, rusty brown. The hum of the mirror grew louder, like a tuning fork inside my skull.

My hair was fully copper red now. My eyes, dark as coal. My skin, pale as bone. My reflection no longer smiled, it stared, patient, waiting.

The night came when the whole world went still. No cicadas. No wind. Just the mirror humming.

The glass showed Mom in the kitchen, nightgown soaked red, throat carved open like a second smile. My reflection stood behind her, knife dripping onto the tile.

I locked my door, tied myself tight. But when I woke, I was in the kitchen, knife in hand, Mom’s body sprawled at my feet. Exactly as I’d seen.

I don’t remember leaving my room.

Sirens wailed. The neighbor had called about screams.

Police burst in, guns drawn. “Drop it, Chris!”

I dropped the knife, gagging, but when I looked in the cruiser’s window, it wasn’t me staring back. It was the red-haired thing, smiling, while my real face pounded on the glass from the other side.

They called it a psychotic break.  Now that I really think about it, maybe I’m glad I didn’t tell anyone.

They put me in here after that.  A place for people who “lose touch with reality”.   The halls reek of bleach, the walls too white. They’ve taken away all my reflective surfaces, but I still catch glimpses in a spoon or a windowpane. Always the red hair. Always the smile.

Last week, I heard the mirror was sold at an evidence auction. Someone’s got it now, leaning against a chair in some new bedroom.

Whoever bought that mirror… they’ll see me. And just maybe…they’ll be dumb enough to let me out.
