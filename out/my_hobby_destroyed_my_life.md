I lived fifty years in that house. It was my life. Simple. Peaceful. I raised my children there, grew old with my husband, and cherished the quiet moments of daily life.

Then one morning, that alarm clock, a small black one I’d had forever, started to melt.

I don’t know how to explain it. I woke up before it rang, like I always did. But this time, it didn’t ring. Instead, I watched it soften. The plastic began to drip slowly, like it had been exposed to an impossible heat. The red numbers on the screen were melting too, warping, sliding off the edges, becoming unreadable.

I just froze. A cold weight settled in my chest. Not panic. Not terror. Just that quiet, certain feeling that something was deeply, fundamentally wrong.

In the days that followed, everything around me began to warp.
The kitchen tiles echoed with a strange muffled reverb. The sky outside the windows never really changed. My son called me “Ma’am,” like I was a stranger. And I started losing track of time. Not because I forgot, but because the days didn’t seem to exist anymore.

One night, my husband looked at me while I was staring at another clock, one that also looked like it was melting, and said, “You’re gonna dream of her again tonight, aren’t you?”

I didn’t understand. I didn’t even have time to respond.

Because right then, I heard it.

A dragging sound. A low, dry rustle. Like a tarp being pulled across concrete.

I felt it. Not beside me. Not around me. But somewhere in the corner of the room.

I turned around slowly.

In the shadows, there was something.

A hunched shape. A face stretched and distorted, almost impossible to look at. Its eyes were blank, huge, and staring straight into mine.

And in its arms, the clock. Still melted, still dripping, as if it had never stopped breaking apart.

I woke up screaming.
Not in my bed. Not in my house.
In a hospital bed. Harsh white lights. Machines surrounding me.

They told me I had been found unconscious in an alley. That I had suffered a panic attack. That I had been in a coma for four days.

Four days.

But I had lived fifty years in that dream.

I cried.
Not because it wasn’t real.
But because over there, I was okay. I was whole. I wanted to go back. To forget all of this.

But it’s not over.

On the table next to me, there was a new alarm clock. Shiny. Untouched. But it gleamed strangely. And the numbers on its screen were sliding, slowly, as if they refused to tell me the time.

In the corner of the room, far enough that I could still pretend I was imagining it, the hunched figure. The distorted face. The eyes that never blinked.

It was holding the melted clock.

And it was waiting.

This is my very first scary story. Did you like it? I didn’t.

Since I wrote it, my life has completely fallen apart.

I barely sleep anymore. And when I do, it’s always the same nightmares. That clock melting. That hunched figure watching me from some too-dark corner. I wake up in a panic, convinced something was just here, right beside me.

I feel watched. All the time. In reflections. In hallways. In those drawn-out silences that seem to last a little too long.

But the worst part is, it’s not just me anymore.

My boss, a rational and composed man, was recently diagnosed with acute paranoia. The strange part is that his delusions focus only on me and my family. He’s convinced we’re being followed by something. He won’t say what. He was committed last week.

And my sister. She vanished for two days. When she came back, she wouldn’t speak. Since then, she’s just been sitting alone in the dark, eyes wide open. She hasn’t said a word. She just stares at the corners of every room.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t even know if I’m writing this story to finish it, or to get rid of it.

Did I make a mistake by publishing this? Probably.
But I have nothing left to lose now.
And maybe, if I share it with you, it will stop watching me.
