I know I probably shouldn't be writing this, I'm a  psychologist for crists sake I could lose my job… But I just need help, these people- the kids, this is something I was never trained to help with.

So my work dosn't find this and well… Fire me, I will be calling the place where I work Leap Frog, the name will make sense later. 

The Leap Frog Psychiatric Hospital was started probably ten years ago, I've been working there for five. Got the job just three months out of collage… I know that's a little weird, and honestly it was to me too, no experience and yet a job like this right on my doorstep. I took it though, and for the past five years, things have been normal….

Really normal, until they were admitted.

The way Leap Frog works is that it is both a high and low acutiy crisis facility, but both are kept in the two buildings on the compound. I am assigned to the high crisis facility, and most of the patients I work with have childhood trauma that has caused significant harm, some kind of histeria, or halucinations. Now the twelve patients I am working with show the same symptoms, I just- they're so different than anybody I've worked with before.

Leap Frog assigns their doctors and staff to a certain floor, I am assigned to floor three. Each floor has a capacity of probably over two hunderd patients, each wing of the floor holds twelve patients… So here I am, working with these twelve and questioning why the hell I am even writing this. I should probably stop, but I just- maybe the internet will understand what the heck is going on with these kids…

I'm just gonna stop being an antsy child right now, and get into them.

none of the names I'm gonna use are the kids real names, I don't wanna get them hurt so I'm just gonna use codenames for all of them.



The first patient is a twin with the second, so I'll just describe them together. Patient one I call Star, and the Second Millie. Star has some kind of anxiety disorder, as well as another I can't quite tell what it is. He acted different on both of the days I've met with him, almost like he was two diferent people… While I'm not 100% sure, I just know something was different about him… But I'll have to talk to him more to truly tell, as I've only met him twice and seen him in passing sometimes.

His twin Millie is an odd story, she also probably has an anxiety disorder like her brother,but other than that she seems completely fine. Maybe it's beacuse I haven't spent enough time with her, but she doesn't seem like a kid that would have any reason to be here. I spoke to her and she never reported having any panic attacks, or anything alike… But something is off about her, like I can't tell why she's here, just that she needs to be.

The third patient I'll call Ember, mainly because of the fact that he's a diagnosed pyromainac, and his records (what little I have been given of them strangely) suggest he set many fires in his childhood home. Ember seems to just enjoy the warmth and the sensation of watching things burn, I think he uses it as some kind of stress releaver, but it appears to be a kind of taught behavior as he recalls it as a lesson rather than an instinct. 

This is where I will get into the fact that the twelve kids in this wing have little to no paperwork or records. This hit me as odd, due to the fact that the few bits we do have are just strange in comparison. All of the kids (except Dew who'll I'll get to latter) have very very minimal paperwork, most have their birthdays which we can work backwords to find their ages from, and some of their previous residences. 

Though any records of education or family history has been scrubbed clean.



Moving on, patient four is chameleon. I call them this because they love to sneak around and escape the doctors and nurses. Chameleon seems to hate being alone in a room with just adults, so they often insist on bringing Star or Ember with them as they feel close to the two. Cameleon beyond that is an enigma to me, they don't talk much or at all, and when they do they just repeat "Praise the father, Praise the Lord."

The fifth patient I will call Dew, and to put it bluntly…

He is petrified of water.

Ironic that I gave him that name, but I can explain… Dew hates water, like he will not drink or go ten feet within water unless forced too. Though there is one kind of water he is drawn to, almost like a moth to a flame. 

Rain, 

and by extension.

Morning dew.

The morning I met Dew, it was raining- like cats and dogs pouring. He was pushed up against the window of his room, and was watching the rain intensely. His roommate who I'll talk about in a second said he had been acting that way for years ever since he had experianced time with 'the father.' I still have no idea who this 'father' is, I think it might be the same pesron Chameleon was talking about, as everybody in this wing arrived together.

Regardless Dew was hard to pull away from the rain. 

The weird thing was his hair was damp, almost as if he had actually been outside which was impossible. Dew never willingly went near water, and there was no way he could have gotten out of the institute, or opened the window due to the numerous locks put on them. I'm still trying to figure out what happened, but he is giving no answers. 

Now onto the next strange thing about Dew, as stated earlier he has no records. At. All.

It would be one thing if his parents had just never filled out the paperwork or anything, but when we asked him about his parents he never recalled having any. When we asked him who raised him, he said the 'comune' did. We do however have an actual age for Dew, which we rangled out of him after a lot of questions… Dew said the last somebody had told him he was eight. Dew dosen't look eight, or even nine… Dew looks like he's probably six, but acts double his age. The working theory for me at least was that Dew was exposed to some kind of punishment via water leading to hydrophobia, and that the kid had to raise himself. I don't know how close I am, so I'd like some opinions from all of you. Let me know if you have any theories.

Anyways I'm gonna talk about patient six, since I think she's one of the stranger of the patients. Stitch, is what I would call the definition of a Hikikomori. She shared a room with Millie which would make you think she has some social interaction. But by talking to Millie, I learned Stitch doesn't talk to her or to anybody. Nurses and myself have been met with science, and she ignored us when we come in. Now I know hikikomoris typically have total iccolation, but since Stitch isn't able to do that, she keeps the dividers that we use to give the patients some privacy closed off from her area. 

I call the kid Stitch because that's all she watches. Lilio and Stitch, won't touch the TV if it's not on, and only draws in a coloring book that contains Lilio and Stitch drawings. All of them are filled in, but she makes each of the drawings more and more realistic as she got access to a twenty four pack of markers. 

She's an odd kid, one I check in with every day. (seven times so far.) 

The next kid Lion is fairly 'normal' compared to the oddities of the others. He has depression and has Seperation Anxiety Disorder, Lion hates being away from me or his roommate, Dew. Lion seems to know Dew like the back of his hand, and Dew his. Lion makes sure there's no water that will scare Dew, and Dew nevere leaves Lion's side. The two are basically glued at the hip, if you get one you get the other. 

Lion dosn't talk about what him and Dew have been through, just that the two of them had known each other for a very long time. (which is strange considering their ages) Lion is fourteen, and acts consistently like an older brother to Dew. Lion also takes care of Chameleon and has tried to contact Stitch to no avail. Overall I consider him to be the big brother and protector of the group.

Patient seven I refer to as 'Veil.' Veil is an odd kid, (Well all of them are odd, but you know what I mean) she is quiet, not silent… just whenever nobody's talking there's always and uncomfortable silence around her. Veil speaks Korean mainly, only one of the three times I've met with her she's spoken any kind of English. Though all my questions are in English, she answers in Korean as previously stated. 

Veil is the oldest of all the kids in this institution, she's fifteen. She acts older though, I'd say about seventeen. Alongside Lion, Veil acts as the main protector of the group. Veil often is never alone, she likes traveling with groups but won't have  a meltdown like Lion if she is left alone. 

Veil from what I have observed also has some kind of auditory proscessing disorder. While I can't speak Korean, my co-worker Lexi can. She told me that several times that Veil misheard words or had a hard time understanding her. 

Anyways this is all to say that Veil is very much like Millie in that she shows no signs of needing to be here, but she just is. Veil as far as I can tell is perfectly mentally healthy, maybe a tad bit of anxiety, but she's normal…

The next kid in the hall is Veil's roommate, who I call Vigil. Vilgil has insomnia, hence the name . Also I'm convinced he can see in the dark. Since I work pretty late, I often am around in the later hours typically three pm to twelve am, and I check on Vigil to make sure he's asleep.  He's  never been asleep so far on my visits. 

Vigil hasn't slept basically at all upon arriving in the past week. He slept a bit last Wednesday (I'm writing this on my day off on a Sunday) and some on Friday, but not much other than that. I don't know how that kid's body is still running, I need to be up and doing things with at least eight hours of sleep everyday. (Not that I really even get that with my other job)

Anyways moving on, the ninth patient's name is JJ. She's a big talker! JJ talks the most out of all the other kids, but the other doctors and nurses say she doesn't talk to them at all… I guess she just really likes me? Not sure though.

JJ is the kid I have the most information from, as she has talked quite a bit about her life. JJ is thirteen and her birthday is actually coming up fairly soon! (If I post another update I'll tell you guys how it went!) JJ says her Mom is probably looking for her, but said nothing when I asked about her dad.

JJ also gave a bunch of details when I asked about the other kids! She was the one to actually tell me that all twelve of them knew each other before coming to the ward. She was also the one to clarify some things about "the father." Basically all these kids had this father figure I guess, they didn't grow up with their own dads, just this one.

JJ confirmed to me that none of them are siblings, (Except Star and Millie who are twins) just that they all call him that. The kid is really bright, they said they were the first to 'realize' but never explained it. JJ said all of those who learn are lost to the Father… or something like that. 

I didn't get to talk to her after friday, so hopefully when I go in tommorow I can ask her a few more things. (and maybe like record them like a jornalist I hope.)

Kid number ten I nicknamed Orange, and I'll pair them with the next kid Apple since they're always together. Orange is very reserved, but peppy when you get to know them… or at leats that's what Apple says. Orange is the troublemaker of the dozen. They've started two fights already, (One with Ember, and one withVigil) and JJ says they get on her nerves a lot. Apple typically calms Orange down. 

Apple says that Orange's episodes are the dispelling of Sin and the excising of the will of the Lord. 

Look… I didn't grow up Cristian. Hell I haven't touched a bible a day in my life- but this… 

At least I know God shouldn't hurt us.

So who the actual fuck taught a kid to preach like that.





For my sake and yours I'm goingn to move on before discussing Apple a bit more.

The last kid I'll call Coffee. 

He- him and Apple are the reasons I'm turning for help. 

I know places like this have had stories similar to this. So I just need any help, and sure it's probably gonna end in failure, but at least maybe I'll get something out of it.


So here goes.



Coffee and Apple pray once an hour everyday, even if it's 3am. (Okay they do pass out before then according to Lexi, but you get the point.) Anyways… I don't know how they do it… but Coffee has cuts and marks… fresh ones… they shoudln't have access to anything like that, I checked… five times.

Coffee's scars have stayed red for longer than they should, (we don't really know when he got them but we think he's had them for at least a week or two before coming to LeapFrog) and Apple's have fadeded a bright white. It's not normal, we contacted a hospital, and they said they'd check it out four days ago… We've had radio silence since then. 

Like from all phone lines.

I called my mom from work, no reply.

Dad… Nothing.

Actually for my dad I got what sounded like a scrambled version of his voice, but I'm not sure… I only heard it for a few seconds, but I don't know.

It was fine once I left the facility though…

So I guess that's why I'm making this.

I don't know if some cosmic entity or divine intervention has entered the facility, just that something is wrong. 

I appologize if my grammar is bad, or if my spelling is off, I'm up at four am writting this because I can't be damned to go back to sleep.  Also I got a degree in people's brains, not in how they write things…

Anyways, thank you for reading, leave Advice if you have any.
