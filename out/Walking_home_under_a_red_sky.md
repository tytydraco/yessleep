It was one of those eerie nights, the stars hidden behind a thick layer of fog that was dyed red by the street lights. The sleet from the night previous had melted away, but the concrete sidewalks were all ashy in remembrance. 

My breath fogged in the air, and I pressed my gloved hands to my cheeks – why, I don’t really know. Probably to capture that warm air, but with how the winter chill had seeped into my bones, I should have already known that it would have no effect. 

I had no way of knowing, but I was probably a sorry sight. My entire face was stinging with the cold, and every so often I’d have to rub away a drip from my nose. The long and thick legs of my pants were tucked into my boots, but with every step I felt as though my legs would simply crumble right off of me because of the cold.

The walk, which never looked that far a distance when driving back and forth for every day since I’d moved, now felt like an impossible distance. 

In all honesty, I hadn’t been all that concerned when I’d driven out. The only reason I’d bundled up at all was because I had friends badgering me against getting sick, and I felt the need to prove a point. All I needed was a quick trip to the Pharmacy, because I was about to run out of my prescription anxiety medication and with my propensity to procrastinate, I had to follow the motivation as it came to avoid waking up to find an empty pill bottle.

The drive passed in a haze, but I can remember the sting of the bright lights in the Pharmacy, and how the staff working the counter had the same dead-eyed gaze as me. Everything was in a late night haze until I went to get back to my car, and found to my dismay that it wasn’t where I remembered parking it. 

In fact, the parking lot was empty. 

Beginning to panic, I turned back towards the Pharmacy, only to find the store had suddenly gone dark, the only thing left illuminating the parking lot being the streetlights, which faintly hummed in the silence.

I’d never been somewhere so quiet. 

My phone was still in the car, so I resigned myself to walking home, the Pharmacy was only a few minute’s drive, anyhow. I thought that it would be fine, hell, I wasn’t even that cold.

It goes back to the orange sky, of course. I remember being younger, and being fascinated by how the glow of the moon could illuminate the night even though I was so often told that the light of the moon didn’t hold a candle to the light of the sun. Under the haze, the comfort of those childhood memories is lost. I stare up at the sky, and I swear the sky begins to stare back.

Imagination is certainly a wild thing. 

I tug at my short hair, trying to yank the strands that they’d actually do something to warm my ears, but it was no use. I still had a couple blocks to go, and the cold wasn’t going to let up any time soon.

Step, step. The cracks in the concrete were all starting to blur into a wall of tan in varying shades, but the cold does wonders to keep me awake. 

A car whizzes past. I look up, but despite the push of wind I know for certain I’d just felt, the street is still empty. 

I glance back up at the sky. There’s the faintest of light spots where the moon peeks through the cloud cover, but by the time I get a lock on it, it’s already starting to fade out of sight. 

The world goes cold, quiet, and orange once more.

“Just a few more blocks,” I mutter to myself. “Not even two miles, you’ve got this.”

In my imagination, my voice echoes for miles, the words distorting to the point of being unintelligible while never truly fading. 

I shudder, glancing at the line of houses I’m walking past. Every light is dark, even the Christmas decorations, and all the driveways are empty. 

The streetlights continue to glow on the empty streets, the only proof that the power hasn’t gone out. 

Slowly, the moon begins to peek back out of the cloud cover, right as I step onto a crosswalk, not bothering to look both ways since the streets are still deathly silent. I feel myself untense under the faint glow, warmth finally beginning to sink back into my skin. 

A horn shrieks, and in my surprise I turn to face it instead of moving out of the way.

I don’t know if it was my own foolishness or some sort of intervention that resulted, but I know this:

Never trust a sky with no stars. There's a reason they never teach you about a red sky.
