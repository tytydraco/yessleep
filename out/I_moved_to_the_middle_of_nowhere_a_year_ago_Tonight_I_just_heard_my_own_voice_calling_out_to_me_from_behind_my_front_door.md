“Is there someone at the door?”

I go very still. Hands slippery around the knife that I’m holding, though I know that it won’t help much. I’ve heard the end is quick, when they find you.

“Is there someone at the door?”

It’s my own voice, spoken back to me. There’s a sound like something heavy being dragged across my porch. I breathe very hard, fill my head with hot dizzy air. I don’t know what the dragging sound is. I scratch my arm as I try to process it. 

Maybe they have tails. Nobody would know. Nobody’s ever seen one. All we have is crime scenes and audio recordings from 911 calls. That’s how the police knew to warn us: *When a COFID comes to your door, they’ll call out with a familiar voice. Maybe a friend, maybe a family member. If you respond, there will be a minute of silence. Then you’ll hear your own voice repeated back to you.*

The sound of hinges squeaking—

“Is there someone at the door?”

Steady thuds of footsteps. I’ve gone off some high point of insanity and feel myself falling, now, falling into a black hole of panic. Can’t run. Can’t make myself move.

“Is there someone—”

My voice sounds unsure. I’ve always hated hearing it repeated back to me on phone calls and voice recordings. *I sound like a little kid,* I’d complain, and my family would laugh. Such a coward.

I swallow hard. Try to catch a glimpse of my reflection in the knife I’m holding, but it’s too opaque, too scratched up. Just got it sharpened recently, though. Nothing more dangerous in a kitchen than a dull knife—that’s what my mother used to tell me, waving it around like a conductor’s baton as she lectured. Good cook, my mom. Me, too, though I’m not like her; I’ve never had anyone else to cook *for* except for myself.

The footsteps stop. Some of the fear fades from me, and I relax my fingers, readjust my grip. The COFID had to come first for me with my neighbor’s voice because there was no boyfriend or friends to imitate. I’d never met my neighbors beyond cursory head-nods and *hello*\-s at the grocery store in town, but I’d responded anyway. I was so stupidly desperate to hear a voice that hadn’t come from my TV, all the way out here in the middle of the woods.

But the COFID is quiet now. Its breathing is loud, hot, laborious. It shifts. An enormous shadow splays across the opposite wall from me, covering up pictures of our last family trip to the Grand Canyon.

The very last one. My mother’s skin like paper, and still she’d been so brave at the end of her life. *Oh honey,* she’d sighed, and the respirator had sighed, and the nurse had looked away with pity, *Don’t worry about me. I’ll be alright.*

*Don’t disappear on us once I’m gone, y’hear? I know how you get.*

No fear at all, in her eyes. Only love. 

Not like me. Not like me.

I grit my teeth and crane my neck to the side. My phone’s still sitting on the kitchen table. I see the black shape of the COFID rolling, heaving, laughing gently to itself as it picks it up in one enormous hand. The glass shatters, rains down in silver jagged tears. The police won’t even have a 911 call from me to go off from, then, I suppose. They’ll probably figure out what happened anyway—COFID crime scenes are quite… *distinct*. I watched a True Crime documentary about it. They hardly leave bones behind.

A hot, sharp pain springs up in me, almost carries me to my feet—I can’t disappear again. Can’t make my dad and my sister think I left them *again* like I always do. There needs to be some parts of me left behind.

So I’m fighting, then, I decide. I shake my head at myself, close my eyes, almost laugh. I’ve never been much of a fighter. This is one hell of a time for me to start.

The COFID drags closer. The police say not to look at it, so I don’t as I swing my knife and use the COFID’s startled groan (in my voice, God I sound *awful* when I’m in pain, even more like a child) to open the drawer closest to the table. This is *my* kitchen, I tell myself under my breath as I wrestle for a lighter, this is my safe space, my comfort place. If there were ever a place where I could be strong, it would be here.

An unidentifiable limb reaches for me—I click the lighter twice, and the COFID screeches and jerks back at the small burst of flame. I keep the lighter close to me. 

I run. 

I run into my garage—red gas can. Yes, that’s what I need. I carry it outside, it’s fucking *heavy* because I hardly used any of it to fill my lawn mower the last time I had any motivation to look after my lawn but it’s a jungle again out there now, tall grass where maybe I can disappear. I screw the can’s top off and splash gas all over the side of the house.

(My aunt’s house, technically. It was left to me after her death.)

(I have nothing that I can really call my own. But maybe—maybe this—)

“IS THERE SOMEONE AT THE DOOR?”

My own voice, screeched at an inhuman pitch. I spill a trail of gasoline a safe distance away and bend over and light it.

“IS THERE—”

I squeeze my arms tight around me and walk away. Before long, there’s warmth at my back, and ahead: the sky full of stars. Dark, swaying trees.

Venus glints, signaling the morning.

I walk and I walk, and try to ignore the branches breaking behind me. *Let the COFID come, if it’s not dead,* I think, jutting up my chin. Let it use up what little breath it has left to kill me, and then let it die.

At least I got to hear another voice one last time.
