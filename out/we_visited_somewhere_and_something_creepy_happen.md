Ok so it's a story when i was like 6 or 7 yrs old or lets just say 2014 so me my mom dad my grandma and my uncle(my dad friend) visited a holy place.

 i am from india and here we have faith in god very much so (lets called the holy place mars) so we reach mars a night it was like 1 or 2 am and all the hotels are book also so many rooms like arbnb not airbnb but yeah like it so somehow we spent thee night at somewhere don't know where.

 next day we have the same problem no hotel found and we wanna book a hotel near the temple so it will be nearby and we can visit it any time.

 so after sometimes during night we found a school name i don't know the school name because it was a abandoned school and also it just have a secuirty guard don't know why it even have a guard what theives gonna steal from a abandoned school 

so when we visit that school my dad asked the guard can we stay at tthat school for night and he answered yeah but just 1 night we were also good in that because we had to leave mars after that night.

 ( summarise the whole things day 1: we reach at night no hotel day 2: same day as day 1 no hotel found but found a abandoned school at night day 3: we have to leave mars or the abandoned school)

 ok so we were at the school me my mom my grandma and no one was in that school my dad and uncle was at the temple and it was night time (in india even at night time holy places are crowded) so like around 1 or 2 am we were awake except me i was sleeping what do u expect from a 6 yrs old to stay awake at night no

 so suddendly we heard a knock on our door so we open the door we thought it must be the guard who came to told us smthing(i know it was a dumb thinking why the guard will even have to do with us at 1 am) so we were like ok lets open the door, there was no one we thought it must be rats who are creating some noise and we thought it's a knock on door. 

so we again close the door and after some time again we heard a door knock we thought it was rats so we ignored it but after few mins we again heard it there was dead silence so now we are confirmed that it was not rat it was someone really on the door so first we thought not to open the door and we tried to call dad he didn't answered the phone nor the uncle

 so my mom tried to see in the lower level of door the clearance yeah clearance so she tried to look at that clearacne or gap she saw that there was a girl legs a girl was standing there like a teenage girl

 i mean so my mom got scared that why a girl is standing at a door in night time so now in our dumb brains the thought finally came that we are now at a haunting place and that was not a girl that's a ghost or a soul or whatever 

so we thought what to do ,in short we got panicked and then my grandma thought that we should call a priest (something like priest not priest) and he told us first not to panick and chant some spiritual things (something like idk how to explain we call it mantr ) till it was day we start chanting it (what i mean by chanting is not like screaming but at a low voice).

 and after that around 4 am my dad and uncle came and we felt relief and after like 2 hour we leave that abandoned school and finally we found a hotel (also one thing when we were leaving the guard was not at the door nor his things are there)

when we found the hotel we sleep for like 8 or  9 hrs because of the stress 

after that my dad again go there and ask some people around there (those people who were leavin near that school for a long time) they told us that school was haunted and a girl commited s\*icide in that school bcz she fall in love with someone but here parents aren't agree with the marriage so she end her life

we still visit mars or the holy place every year but never go near that school

(if any question related to story feel free to ask also it was 100% true story i don't thing you will accept it that it was real but what we face is what we face)
