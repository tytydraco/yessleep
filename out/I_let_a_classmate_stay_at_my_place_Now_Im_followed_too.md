Yes, 47 minutes ago my classmate from primary school has sent me this exact message:

"Hey! Sending this to my every contact. Could I please stay at your place? I'll answer any questions once I'm there."

Now I hadn't seen him since primary school ended 11 years ago and I was fairly certain that our paths would never cross again. Don't think I hated him, he was just always weird. But I guessed that after so much time he must have changed. Besides everyone has tough times in life. And so I answered:

"Yeah sure you can stay at my place, here's the adress: [MY ADRESS]" 

Now I've heard that he has moved hundreds of kilometers away from our small town, yet only fifteen minutes later the doorbell rang. Michael hasn't changed one bit. Long hair, small backpack, muddy hiker boots and a stained shirt. I obviously wanted to ask him about how life was going by in the decade when we haven't seen each other, but he simply said to take the small talk inside. 

He said that a blue-haired guy was following him. Now, you can imagine me thinking of an accident and hearing about a blue-haired dude, then just bursting out laughing. But he was dead serious. 

"I know, sounds funny. But this man who I have never met before keeps on finding me. At cafes, restaurants, in public transport and even in front of my apartment. I just feel concerned and want to get this off me." 

As he said that the doorbell rang. I look through the peephole and I saw this guy with dyed blue hair just right outside the door. 

"No way. It has to be a fucking coincidence." I said, to which he simply replied "Tell me. How many people in an Eastern European country who are of the age of around 30-40 years have their hair dyed blue? And more than that, how many of them have knocked on your door?"

I stood there along with him, silently when after some time a voice echoed from beyond the door. "Open up Michael. Or Caroline. I just want to talk." 
This guy somehow also knew who **I was**. 

The man began banging on the door, which wasn't made of the strongest material, since it was slightly more durable than cardboard. It began to break, and we knew that our only option was to jump from the window. While a two-floor drop was unpleasant, we fell into some bushes that softened the fall a bit. Although my foot was aching so much that I couldn't drive a car, and so Michael sat behind the wheel. 

Neither I, nor Michael have ever seen this man in our life before. We are theorising about what he has done to earned his fate while I am probably just the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time. But even now as I am typing this out on my phone I see a strange light blue car. Now if you ever drove around Eastern Europe you know that if a car is blue, it is dark blue. Yet this car that is slowly catching up is fully light blue, and I think I can see a blue-haired man behind the wheel.
