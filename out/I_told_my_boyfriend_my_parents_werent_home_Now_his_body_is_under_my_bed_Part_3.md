Dad used to stand on the porch during tornadoes.  Something about gale force winds and funnel clouds pulls men out of safe basements like sirens singing to sailors.  Despite years of working with dozens of patients with all manner of disorders and mental struggles, I’ll never understand what would give anyone the urge to stand under a sky that was ready to swallow them up.

Once, Mom hurried me down to the basement while the robotic NWS broadcast blared from the radio.  Instead of following us down, Dad just stood there, staring at the sky, telling Mom he “Just wanted to see it.”  We were lucky it passed us by with nothing more than damage to the siding, and Dad was lucky Mom didn't tear him apart for not coming down sooner.

This time, the storm wouldn't miss.

Outside, the black funnel ripped up the ground of the field.  What few trees filled the line at the edge were torn from the Earth and spat into the dust and debris filling the air.  It would only be a few minutes before it pulled the house up the same way.

Inside, the demon beneath me screamed that disorienting wail against the sirens in the sky.  My head throbbed in the chaos while the bed was rocked by its frantic movements.  Whatever that thing was, I think it was just as terrified of the storm as me.

My fear was replaced with desperation as the twister walked closer and closer.  I didn't stop to consider what the monster would do to me if it caught me.  I wasn't thinking about how part of me felt okay with dying.  At that moment, I wanted to live.

I leapt from my bed towards the door, the monster jerking from the added pressure.  Hopefully, it would be more concerned with the storm than with its dinner trying to get away.  The distance was too far for me to make at once, so I tripped and landed with a thud just a few feet shy of safety, pain firing from the cut on my stomach.  I started to reach up for my door handle when the eardrum bursting sound shifted direction from my window to me.

I shouldn't have looked.  Out of all the things I heard, felt, and saw that night, it was that moment that refuses to fade or blur within my memories.  Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at Sodom and Gomorrah.  I was turned into a pillar of ice, frozen solid from the inside out, every drop of warmth drained from me as my eyes met what waited beneath the bed.

Logan’s mangled body was laid out on his side facing me, half covered by a bloody pile of torn sheets.  His bare torso had gashes exposing snapped ribs and overflowing ends of severed entrails.  The open stump of his right arm hung next to his torn side.  His neck bent at an unnatural angle and the soft lips I kissed just hours before were covered in stains of dried blood.  Those glossy, lifeless eyes still stare back at me when I try to sleep.

His head started to move, but I knew it was impossible for him to be alive in that state.  Five bloody digits wrapped around his head from behind, one piercing the bottom of Logan's left eye.  The hand adjusted Logan's neck while a dark shape shot up from behind his shoulder.

In what little space it had available, a grey, scaly mound of a head rose up just enough to reveal a shining pair of silver, almost human eyes.  The world around me felt quiet while I stared into them for what felt like forever.  I didn't feel peaceful, but I did feel ready.  Ready for the end, for the storm, and for what that thing would do to me.  Part of me still feels ready now.

I may have stayed that way if the whining and scratching from under my door hadn't pulled me back to reality.  Clover's bark barely registered against the storm and the monster, but it was enough for me.  No matter how I felt about myself, I was going to get her to safety.

I climbed to my feet as fast as possible and swung open the door.  Clover yelped when she saw me, part relieved and part terrified.  I stepped into the hallway and tried to close the door just as fast, when a force yanked my leg backwards and dropped me to the floor.  That thing’s arm wrapped around my leg, it's sharp claws tearing through my skin.  It thrashed violently, almost lifting me up as it did so.  When it slammed me down, white-hot pain tore down my leg and I heard the wet pop of my kneecap dislodging.

I wanted to cry.  I tried to scream, but I couldn't even hear it above the wind and the ringing that threatened to burst my head in two.  The arm started to pull me back into my room, the pain in my leg feeling like it was about to be ripped off.

“God, please!” I yelled.  “I don't wanna die!  I DON'T WANNA DIE!”

I gritted my teeth and prepared to be pulled back into the darkness, the pit where that thing took Logan's body.  To my surprise, it didn't come.  Instead, the grip around my throbbing leg loosened.

I looked back to see Clover, that reckless, amazing girl, biting down hard on the arm.  The hand released its grip and thrashed her away, knocking her into a wall down the hall.

“Clover!” I screamed in rage and pain.  It tried to reach out for me again, but I used all the strength in my good leg to slam my door shut.  The thing shrieked and writhed in pain against the door frame, so I kicked it again and again and again.  Finally, it recoiled back into my room.  I caught one last glimpse of Logan as that thing flailed in the dark, and I slammed my bedroom door shut for the last time.

Hobbling up against the wall, I made my way to Clover.  My resilient girl stood up with a whine, but made her way over to me.  I was so relieved to see her okay, but that went away when the house began to shake.

“Clover,” I said with painful breaths, “downstairs.  Now.”

She listened to me and made her way to the basement door, barking and whining at me.  I trudged along as quickly as I could, half-crawling to safety when the walls started to move.  Outside the windows were nothing but pitch blackness and the sound of freight trains roaring.  I finally made it to the basement door when a barely audible crash came from the hall behind me.  I didn't stop to turn around to look, and slammed the basement door shut.

Clover and I made our way down the stairs.  I made it about halfway down when the shaking became too much.  I lost my footing and rolled to the bottom, cracking pain coming from my already broken leg.  I fought to move to the corner of the room, crawling over stale pieces of popcorn and leaving a trail of red in the carpet.  Clover even tried pulling on the collar of my bloody shirt to help me along.  She deserved more treats than I could ever give her.

I made it to Clover's bed and dragged it over us.  I doubted it would protect us when the house fell on top of us, but at least it would cushion the blow.  The last thing I remember before blacking out was Clover gently licking my face.

“Thank you, girl.  I'm sorry you're scared.  It'll be alright.”

I closed my eyes as my vision blurred.

“Lord, please keep Clover safe, and tell Logan I love him.  As for me…” I was out before I finished my prayer.  I hoped He heard me.

We spent hours in the dark.  My dreams were filled with flailing limbs and the sound of sirens.  Silver and glossy eyes stared at me wherever I looked.  I didn't know if I was dead or alive, and I didn't really care.

“Sophie!” came a male voice.  “She’s over here!  Sophie, wake up!  Please!”

I tried to open my eyes, but couldn't.  Dull pain filled my body, moving through my throbbing head, stomach, and leg.  My vision was still hazy, but I could see my Dad looking down at me with fear and relief on his face.  I heard Clover yip beside me and Mom ran over holding her leash.  I tried to move, but my whole body was racked with pain.

“Sophia,” said Mom with tears in her eyes.  “Are you okay, baby?”

“It all hurts, but I think I’m okay.”

The room got brighter as my eyes adjusted.  Sunlight came through the open window and I saw I was no longer in our basement.  My leg was suspended over my hospital bed and an IV flowed into my arm.

“Thank God,” she said.  “We tried calling all day.  We thought you were crushed.  The house is…”

“Don't worry,” said Dad with a half smile. “It’s gonna be alright.  The Good Lord and insurance will take care of the rest.”

I started to smile with them. Somehow, after everything, I was alive.  My heart and the tears in my eyes dropped when I remembered who hadn't.

“Sophie?” asked Dad. “What's wrong?”

“Logan.”

“We’ve tried getting a hold of him,” said Dad.  “His parents haven't heard anythi-”

“He’s…” I couldn't say it.  It hurt so much to think about, and no one would have believed me anyway.  They would think I was crazy and maybe I was.  I didn't know what to say.

“Baby, it's okay,” said Mom.  “Please, what happened?”

I did the only thing I could do.  I told the truth.

I told them I made Logan come over, even though he didn't want to.  I brought Logan to my room, even though he stopped us from going too far.  We stayed there, sleeping until the storm hit.  I couldn't wake him up and he didn't make it in time.

They should have screamed at me.  They should have told me it was my fault.  God should have struck me dead right there, but none of that happened.  Instead, they cried with me and told me everything was going to be alright.

They found Logan's body three days later.  The storm ripped through town as well, so it was a miracle a crew found it as fast as they did.  He was miles from our house, covered with the wreckage of my bed, snagged in bloody sheets.  They never showed me what his body looked like, but I already knew.  His parents opted to cremate what was left of his body.  Everyone assumed the storm did that to him.  No one ever thought it could be anything else.

It's been ten years since then.  Insurance built our house back better than ever, and Logan's parents even put the money they had saved for his college to mine.  I couldn't tell them no, not when they hugged me, not when they gave me a vial of his ashes, and not when they gave me the ring he had them keep so his roommate wouldn’t steal it.  I felt like a thief taking it, and tonight is the only time I’ve ever worn it.

Mom and Dad bought a new house closer to town last year.  They offered to help me pay for my own somewhere else, but I told them I would put my entire savings into buying this one from them instead.  They gave it to me instead.  They thought they understood why I couldn't leave.

Clover, my brave, beautiful girl, stayed with me here as long as she could.  Her ashes are in a box next to Logan's, right under my side of my bed.  I like to think they are both still keeping me safe.  Safe from that thing.

No one ever found a trace of it, not that anyone told me about at least.  I know Logan and Clover are together now, waiting for me in Heaven.  I don't know where that demon is, but I hope it was blown to Hell.  Either that or it's still out there somewhere, waiting to drag me down with it.

I'm writing this because I need to tell someone the truth.  I should tell Mom and Dad about every lie I told.  They’re calling me now, but I can't bring myself to answer.  I should tell Logan's parents how I really got their son killed.  Maybe telling you here will make it easier to do tomorrow.

If you're reading this, please pray for me.  There's a storm rolling in tonight.  I can hear the sirens in the distance.

I'm thinking about leaving my window open.
