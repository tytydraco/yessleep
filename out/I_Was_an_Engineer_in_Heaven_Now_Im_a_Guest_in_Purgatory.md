When the elevator doors opened and Gabriel stepped out, escorted by an unfamiliar face donning a familiar uniform, I thought for a second I was seeing a ghost. He'd been there recently enough that his chewing gum's minty smell still lingered in the dormitory's corridors, comingling with the odor of copper and burnt-out electronics. The last time I had seen him was three weeks earlier, as he departed from Heaven for the first time, the sound of his sarcasm following him into the backseat of the van that carried both him and Matteo back to the airport.

"Welcome back to Heaven, Father! There's even less left now than the first time you were here." I said, attempting to diffuse the sour look that was already plastered across his face.

"You know very well I'd have rather stayed in Rome than ever come back to this frozen *hellscape."* He said, a bitterness in his voice even deeper than the mines that ran beneath our very feet (if any of them were even *left* after the events that transpired here during his last visit, or the events that were to come).

"What do you-" I started my response, but was cut short by Gabriel rushing me and grabbing my coat, nearly lifting me off my feet.

"Hear me now, *boy.* I had *nothing* to do with Sister Lucia's disappearance, and you know that!" He was screaming now, froth forming at the corners of his mouth, either from the disintegration of the gum he was chewing or the sheer rage that now drove him towards me, "I only *agreed* to come back so I could throttle you for the implicat-" He was cut off by one of the guards hitting him with a low-power burst, causing him to lose grip of my jacket and fall to the snow.

"Stand down," I warned the guard, holding up my hand and signalling for him to put away his weapon. "Father, what do you *mean* you had nothing to do with Lucia's disappearance? That fact is obvious; unless you can atomize people at will, nobody in their right mind would accuse you of such."

The bitterness in his face melted into a scowl once again, not of hatred but of contemplation. "So you *aren't* the one who sent these goons to my parish, dragging my poor elderly Bishop along behind them to accuse me of *murder*, or *worse?"* He questioned, his eyes scanning my face, likely looking for signs of a deception that even *I* wasn't privy to.

"Father, I was only just this morning informed that you would be returning to us, and I was told you would be doing so *willingly*." I directed this last word more in the direction of the priest's captors than him, once again warning them with my eyes that he was not to be touched again. They took the hint and started back towards the front gate, where the van still idled. I helped him to his feet and brought him inside.

"They cornered me as I left my office. I was bundled into a closed room, in a catacomb where the light of God has likely never shone. My bishop was there waiting, along with *those two*," he explained, looking over his shoulder towards the vault door that led back to the snow outside. "They had 'evidence' of what I had 'done' to Lucia; a video of us walking through a terminal together, and Father Matteo and I pulling her into a door\*... God\* knows what they were implying we did to her. You and I both know that such a video should not exist. Lucia *never* left this nightmare, and it occurs to me now that I likely won't escape it either." He finished, rage fading to hopelessness as he bowed his head and looked at the floor.

"Once again, Father, I assure you I had no part in this. The Field does not take kindly to *coercion*. Anyone versed in the incident logs of the previous experiments should have known that, and should never have done what has been done to you." The knot in my stomach had tightened,  Have you heard from the other Father who was here with you?"

At about this time, I heard the howl of the wind from the front door opening cut above the constant hum that surrounded the facility. I started to walk back towards the door, but spotted the source of the commotion before I made it very far; Dr. Kruger, the Site Director of Theta-7 and the foremost expert in the entirety of the organization when it came to entity containment, was hurrying towards his office with his signature briefcase clutched tightly in his fist. He paused just long enough to piss me off. "Good Morning, Erik. I hope you are ready to *redeem* yourself for your previous failures. I will be overseeing the experiments *personally* this week."

Shortly after the devil himself walked back into Heaven, I spotted the lost lamb of the dynamic duo wandering the corridors. Matteo paused in front of the rebuilt chapel, examining the freshly installed containment lattice.

Of my own design, and one of the few things on this rock that *actually* stood a snowball's chance in *Hell* of containing the Type-A that manifested three weeks before. The lattice consisted of three modified RDCs capable of creating an overlapping Nullity, with a state-of-the-art PRN array in the center, which would generate a pocket of stable Kyrie Field. In theory, any entity that was caught in the lattice would have two choices: be forced into the pocket of stable resonance or have its KF signature torn to shreds by the Nullity emanating from the RDCs.

I met Father Matteo in the corridor outside the chapel and greeted him. It should go almost without saying, but he wasn't there by choice either. I strongly suspected that *Kruger* was behind this; of course, in his relentless search for an answer in the void, he *would* allow his hubris to lead him to forget the very basics of Field research, or worse, *ignore* them.

I led the pair to their rooms for tonight, the very same rooms they stayed in on their first visit, actually. I did not fail to notice that a guard was now patrolling the wing, and heavy-duty locks had been installed on all three doors. At that point, I hadn't yet realized that *Heaven* had become a *prison* for more than just the entities we intended to contain. I retired to my own quarters shortly thereafter.

In the drop box outside my door, I noticed a manila envelope with my name on it. Inside were the details of the experiments to be performed in the days to follow, culminating with the attempted capture of the Type-A entity that had eluded our grasp thus far. I immediately noticed a perceived flaw within the Bad Doctor's plan; there were only two celebrants listed in the personnel section of the documents.

"Why is this an issue?" you may be asking. Well, fear not, dear reader, Erik is eternally long-winded and has an answer!

It was believed in the early days of Penumbra that any fewer than three celebrants would never cause any meaningful fluctuation in local Kyrie Field readings. This was and still is *usually* correct *(ever wonder why the minimum number of witches in a coven is generally accepted to be three?),* with some exceptions. The exceptions noted were as follows:

1. An individual with *exceptionally* high KF sensitivity and *exceptional* conviction in their beliefs (regardless of what those beliefs may have been, but Catholicism was found to be the belief system with the most repeatable results both for single individual testing and trio testing) was capable of causing measurable local KF fluctuations similar to those of a trio of lesser KF-sensitive individuals. I have only met *three* such individuals, each more dangerous than the last. The strongest of the three was capable of healing even the most grievous wounds of others at will. I have heard rumors of some *even stronger.*
2. If any one of the three celebrants were infirm or insincere in their convictions, even if all three were KF-sensitive, fluctuations would often fail to occur (or worse, unstable fluctuations would occur, often with detrimental results). I myself fall into this category. I am somewhat sensitive to the Kyrie Field, and I was raised Catholic, but I could never bring myself to blindly believe anything; I needed *Data.*
3. If any one of the three celebrants were completely KF-inert (meaning they had *no* sensitivity to the Kyrie Field), then fluctuations would fail to occur altogether. I suspect that Dr. Kruger fell into *this* category.

The reason, which I believed at the time, that Kruger's plan was flawed, was the fact that *neither* of the Fathers present was sensitive enough to the Field to produce results alone, and even if they were, a trio was still best practice. It wasn't until I got to the *equipment* section of the document that I realized there was an additional RDC listed, purportedly modified to amplify the KF sensitivity of existing conduits, designated "RDC-L-1".

I believed, naively, that this was perhaps some purely technological breakthrough that was being trialed here due to our proximity to the joint research facility not far away. The facility in question is the combined effort of the Technologians, the last known *sane* sect of what would have previously been called the *Purist Enclave,* and whatever faithfully remained of the *Scholars* of the old days as well, colloquially known as "Puragatory". While our methods and motivations were *vastly* different, Heaven and Purgatory "shared notes" sometimes.

I would later come to find that this RDC was *not* the work of any Purists. A Purist wouldn't come *near* that thing if they knew what it really was...

Having read through the documentation and having had a good idea of the rough schedule for the following morning, I set my coffee machine timer to have a steaming flask ready for me at 07:00.

\---

It is at this point that I believe I owe you, dear reader, an explanation. If you have read Matteo's story, which begins [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), you will already know by now who I am and have a good general idea of who I work for, and what I do. I have *also* read Matteo's stories, and rest assured, he will be in no trouble for writing them here. With this being said, I would *strongly* recommend reading Matteo's story first, or at least alongside my own, as the whole picture will be very difficult to glean from this text alone.

As you know, along the way, I promised him some answers. Instead of a Q&A session, I have decided that I will write a story similar to his, with *my* perspective on his second visit to Heaven, as well as some experienced insight on people, places, and things that he requested knowledge about scattered throughout this account, ending with where we are now and what we are currently doing. Think of this as the "*Director's Commentary"* edition of the story. *Forgive* me if this sounds a bit drier than his tale. I am an *Engineer,* and not a *poet*, after all.

Now, back to the story at hand.

\---

I awoke early enough to see the last drips of coffee fall into my flask, and quickly prepared myself for the short walk to the Chapel. I made it to the makeshift command center just in time to see RDC-L-1 being wheeled to the center of the chapel and placed upon its tripod; from what I could see, this was actually a modified *Field Sphere*, which is itself a miniaturized version of the RDC with some extra features built into it, such as a KF sensor array and self-contained Null generator. Those extra features, however, had been stripped away from this one, only the RDC core itself remaining, wired into the surrounding PRN array.

Taking a cursory glance at my monitor, I noticed something unusual; though no one else was in the chapel, the very beginnings of a resonance pattern could already be seen in the graph. Even *more* strange was that I vaguely *recognized* the pattern. It was one I had seen recently, I knew, but I did not connect the dots until later. Very shortly after noticing the pattern, I saw a spike in local KF fluctuations and noticed Matteo and Gabriel walking in, being escorted by Kruger.

"Good morning, Erik. Early to the party as always, I see." He jeered quietly as he took his place beside me on the command center. He then addressed the room, announcing the start of the experiment. Today was simply meant to be resonant testing and analysis. Another breadcrumb on a long trail that led to eventual, unholy revelation was the *manner* in which he announced the experiment; he mentioned RDC-L-1 alongside Matteo and Gabriel, as if it ***were*** the third celebrant.

The testing itself differed from the norm as well; instead of starting with the usual Bible passages, Kruger had the Fathers read through a multitude of strange documents. Random numbers, gibberish, and more gibberish.

\---

Before I begin this next part, I feel another explanation is in order. You may be asking yourself, having read Matteo's story, "Erik, after seeing and hearing what was *obviously* a literal angel quote *Biblical scripture*, how can you still have doubts?" A fine question, my *sweet, Summer child.* 

The entities in the field will almost always take the form and disposition that is expected of them by the majority of the celebrants. Those of the Abrahamic faiths, for example, will cause the voices and apparitions to be *angelic* or *demonic* in nature, depending on the type of entity and whether it is malicious or not, whereas those believing themselves to be a coven of witches summoning Baphomet, for example, will see exactly what they imagine Baphomet to be if it succeeds, for better or worse. 

There is still no consensus on whether or not certain beliefs *attract* certain KF entities, or whether the entities simply *mold* themselves to the beliefs of the celebrants; however, I subscribe to the latter school of thought rather than the former.

Why would I tell *you* this, or, more pertinently, why would I tell either of the *Fathers* this? Wouldn't this information compromise them as viable conduits? Introduce doubt? The truth is that, at this point, I see Matteo and Gabriel as more than conduits in an experiment; these are men that I have escaped death alongside, not once, but *twice.* Though I doubt my words would shake their faith to begin with. And, well, Matteo *did ask*.

\---

That day was... different. The voice that manifested seemed to be *derived* from Matteo and Gabriel's beliefs about what an angel might say, right? "Be Not Afraid" is even one of the most common phrases reported by observers and celebrants alike, and for obvious reasons. The difference was not what was *said,* but *who* said it. The voice was one that I (and many others) had heard before; it was ***Anja's*** voice. 

Anja's voice is *not* a good sign, but it doesn't always spell disaster; the description I gave to the Fathers after this event *was* accurate, but not whole. She *is* known as the "First Witness," but there is another. No, it wasn't *me* who slipped those men the book that Matteo mentioned in his story, though I do suspect I know who it was. Sadly, he never made it out of Heaven that day.

\---

The next day, at around 11:45, I was at the command center terminal reviewing resonance readings from the previous day's tests, as well as from the tests performed during Matteo and Gabriel's first visit to Heaven. This is when I actually put two and two together and realized *why* that resonance pattern from the day before looked so familiar. The resonance pattern was *Lucia's* resonance pattern, slightly less intense but otherwise identical to her patterns from previous tests. I was unsure what to make of this at the time, and had no time to dwell on the thought since, at about that same time, Kruger walked in and took his place beside me again. 

"Today is a *big* day, Erik. I *sincerely* hope your lattice is ready," he snarled at me, and I could see over his shoulder that Matteo and Gabriel were walking into the chapel, taking their place beside the modified RDC. 

The celebrants began their chanting, and for the first few moments, all was quiet. Then, all at once, the pattern I was tracking that showed the similarity with Lucia's increased in intensity to something far beyond any resonance frequency I had ever seen, and the monitor in front of me screamed the alarm. In addition to Lucia's resonance pattern, another familiar pattern appeared on the graphs: the pattern of the NCE that went CE Type-A on us last time, and it was growing. Fast.

"Shut it down! Shut it down now!" I screamed to the technicians along the walls, already noticing that Lucia's resonance pattern was taking a nosedive as the entity's pattern grew exponentially, the graph automatically zooming out in resolution, showing a pattern that dwarfed even Lucia's previous record. Kruger gave me a look of pure disdain, a look that said, "You aren't running the show, stay quiet and let it happen." The technicians noticed the look he gave me had shifted to them, and stopped mid-run.

"Maintain Cadence!" he shouted, but I doubt the celebrants even heard him over the roar of the entity's scripture and the blaring of the alarms. As every light in the chapel turned the color of fresh blood, I pulled Kruger up by the collar and screamed at him over the din: "We have to shut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!"

"We're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!" he yelled back, but I could tell he was *not* confident in his own answer. I shot a look back at my monitor. The pattern had grown beyond the measuring limits of the hardware and had frozen at a level far beyond what was even considered to be *theoretically possible* at the time.

"We weren't prepared for it to consume a near infinite source of resonant energy!" I screamed at him, then realized my endeavor to convince the man was an exercise in futility, and ran for the emergency shutoff myself, but not before hearing the *voice* that I had been dreading, the *true* harbinger of destruction. The voice of the Second Witness, intermingled with Anja's.

***"We await His arrival."***

This was *bad.* Very *bad.* An unprecedented level of *badness* was unfolding before my very eyes. Entities with resonance patterns one-hundredth the size of the pattern I had seen on the monitor had leveled entire facilities and resulted in absolute chaos for the surrounding region. And these manifestations were *always* preceded by the Second's voice.

The manifestation event itself was also unprecedented. Never before had KF entities been known to merge with each other, much less merge with technology in the way that this entity did. I voiced this aloud, and Kruger's response all but confirmed my darkest fears; RDC-L-1 wasn't *just* a modified RDC. 

The documentation I recovered from Kruger's suitcase called it a "Synthetic Conduit Core," and the incident log provided detailed information that, when Lucia's body was atomized in the previous experiments, her KF signature suddenly began emitting from a Field Sphere in the Swedish QRCT's equipment room, just on the other side of the same mountian Heaven was built into, setting off several alarms in the process. Studies on the Field Sphere compared the signature to data collected at Heaven to confirm this; it is almost as if her very *essen*ce was transferred into the Field Sphere. 

\---

What the entity said next chills me to the absolute depths of my core, even to this day:

***"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it."***

And that, my friends, is why *coercion* is to be avoided at all times while doing Field research. I will state it again, ***the Field does not take kindly to coercion*****.** Of any kind, but especially KF-sensitive individuals being coerced to perform rites and chants in an attempt to deliberately draw an entity, it "poisons the well" per se. This is why we brought the Fathers to Heaven under the pretense of helping us "find God" during their first visit, so that they would come and perform ***willingly.***

I will not bore you with the details of our escape from Heaven, as you would have likely read Matteo's account, and mine would be nearly identical. I will tell you that my favorite part of that entire, terrible day was watching Kruger get turned into a pillar of salt. Lol, Lmao even. That guy deserved it. My least favorite part would have to have been getting shrapnel dug out of my back by an overly suspicious physician, but that is neither here nor there.

\---

"What are you three up to now?" you ask. Well, we are still in Purgatory for the time being, but I have received word through official channels that none of us are being blamed for what happened in Heaven, and Matteo and Gabriel are free to return to their homes at their leisure; however, they *have* been offered an interesting deal, should they decide to stay *local.* You see, when the mountain housing Heaven exploded, it took out the entire Swedish QRCT with it. Fathers Matteo and Gabriel have been offered positions on the new QRCT, and I myself have been offered a position at the Thunderdome as a trainer, since the resident trainer who *was* there, Elliot, has accepted a position as a Field Commander over several of the US-based QRCTs.

Matteo has tentatively *declined* this offer and has stated that he would like nothing more than to return home and live out the rest of his days tending to his Flock, but Father Gabriel seemed eager to accept a role as a Field Chaplain. No idea why. I'm not so sure that training fresh idiots to be the real-life equivalent of "Men in Black meets Ghost Busters" is in the cards for me, though, but we will see what the future holds. 

Also, as part of my deal with Matteo, I will answer any of *your reasonable* questions as long as they are posted within the next day or so. Ask away, I suppose, but don't blame me if you *don't like the answer you get.*

Yours truly,

Erik, Engineer-not-a-Poet, potential future trainer at the Thunderdome, lover of Coffee and hater of Kruger.
