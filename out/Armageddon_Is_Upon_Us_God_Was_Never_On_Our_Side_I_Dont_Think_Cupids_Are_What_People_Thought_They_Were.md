I know this sounds crazy, ok? I know this seems out of this world and to be honest, you're right.

My Name Is Kyle Martin, I'm just a local pizza delivery guy for Pizza Castle. If you don't know what that is, It's just some big pizza company that dominates all other pizza restaurants. I usually just make deliveries from around 12 in the afternoon to about 8PM. I have an eight hour job and decent pay as well. I'd go into more detail but Pizza Castle barely even matters at this point.

I have dirty blonde hair and a haircut that resembles a fade. I am around 6,2 and I am not the biggest of people, I'm not skinny but I'm not like- Buff. I inherited my mother's green eyes and I resemble my father greatly except for my face. I'm 21 and my job actually gives me a decent amount of money, not enough to buy me a mansion but enough to hold me over if I use it right. But anyway-

It was just a normal day in April, I was making another delivery to a common buyer; The Andorra family. I was close to their house- Like, a couple feet away from their block. I could even see their house from where I was. I parked my motorcycle nearby and proceeded to grab 2 steaming pizzas ripe for eating.

I accidentally dropped my phone which I had placed loosely in my pocket and went to pick it up and that's when everything went wrong. As I bent over behind my motorcycle to grab my phone, a shock wave blasted me into the nearby bushes with searing burns. I instinctively shut my eyes as my ears rang. At first I thought we had been bombed by terrorists but reality had been much worse than expected. I heard a cacophony of screams erupt through the air and I quickly got out of the bush to assess the situation at hand.

To my Horror, I saw people running from where supposedly the blast had come from and I was just barely able to see figures through the thick, orange fog. I couldn't believe my eyes; it was an angel and a bunch of smaller ones I could only think were cupids as I could faintly see some of them holding bows.

I believe in Christianity and I immediately ran over to see what angels were doing here but someone had grabbed me from behind. I turned in shock to see the mother of the Andorra family grab me by my shirt collar and motioned for me to shut up. I was immensely confused But I obliged and followed her to her house.

I turned back one last time and shivered as I saw an arrow shoot someone nearby who had been trying to crawl away from the chaos. It finally dawned on me that something was seriously wrong and I quickly closed the door behind me.

I followed the woman through her tiny and cluttered house and she eventually led me to her cellar. I was not ready to actually follow this woman who had been silent the entire time into a basement and I was rethinking my choices... when I remembered that guy from earlier and decided to trust this woman.

The cellar was dark and cobwebs lurked in every corner, I coughed as I smelt the high concentration of dust in the air. I swatted away a spider hanging from a thread of cobweb and watched as the woman took out a candle and lit it.

The room was immediately lit up and I found myself in a room with 3 other people. The lady apparently had a daughter as well as a husband. I looked around and realized this was a makeshift bunker with tons of supplies that could probably last a couple months if we rationed correctly.

"Mommy, what's all the noise outside"? The daughter asked in a light tone revealing her uncertainty of how she should react to the situation at hand.

"It's just a thunder storm, Anna". The mother said.

"What's this guy doing here, Nancy". The father asked in a stern voice.

"Hey-" I went to respond to the guy but Nancy cut me off.

"David- He's our pizza delivery man, don't you recognize him"?! She asked.

My face was pretty burnt and so was my clothing from the blast so it seemed possible that he just didn't immediately recognize me.

"OH, Man i'm sorry". He said, apologizing many times to me.

"It's fine I just..." I trailed off as I heard the front door from above crash down with a large boom.

Everyone stayed silent as Nancy quickly turned off the lights and we all cuddled in the corner of the room.

I heard glass shatter as I assumed; those cupids from earlier have finally decided this house was their next victim. We all listened as they tore the house to shreds, obviously looking for us. I looked around at the Andorra family's faces but despite the child's somewhat uncomfortable expression, the parents seemed completely calm. I looked as Nancy suddenly looked troubled.

David seemed to see this and quietly asked her what was wrong.

What happened next made my blood run cold.

"They are tracking us using my necklace, David". Nancy said stiffly.

"Then destroy it-" David went to say but Nancy interjected.

"I can't- It's my grandfather's". She explained.

They continued arguing as the noise upstairs was slowly getting closer. Realizing this needed to end fast, I quickly snatched the necklace out of Nancy's hand and snapped it in half before anyone could react.

Nancy went to attack me and scream at me but David held her back and quickly subdued her.

Anna seemed a bit scared and held onto me as if I was some kind of lifeline to her.

"Are we gonna be ok"? She asked, tears bubbling up to her tears.

A knot tied into my stomach as I went to answer her.

"Yes, everything is going to be fine". I lied.

The parents did not stop fighting however. They wrestled and twice Nancy almost managed to make a grab for me or scream what I could only assume to be insults.

They finally went silent when we all heard a loud bang. We waited for a long time, waiting to see if this was some kind of trick or if they had actually left.

David finally decided to go out and check. He grabbed a pistol off a table nearby and cautiously headed out of the basement.

After a couple more minutes, David returned and motioned for us to come upstairs.

As we walked upstairs we saw that the house was almost completely gone, only a couple poles were still standing. Rubble littered the ground and we saw that every other house on the street had met the same fate. The orange smoke was very thick now and it was hard to even see our own hands. The orange smoke almost felt "Heavy" in some sort of way. Nancy and David decided we should stay in the bunker for a couple more days to see if this would "clear up". I don't know who they are fooling because I don't think those angels just came for a little show and just went up and left.

We reentered the basement and shut the hatch and broke the ice by playing some board games.

"Monopoly anyone"? Nancy asked as if everything was normal.

"Sure, Do you want to join in er- I don't think we caught your name in all the chaos". David said awkwardly.

"Kyle". I said.

"My name is Kyle". I stated with a stronger tone.

"Ah, ok, do you want to join us"? He asked.

"Uh- I'm not really a fan of board games". I said.

"Alright, keep an eye on Anna for us, ok"? He said and moved to a table at the other side of the room to play monopoly with his wife.

I relaxed as tension finally seemed to cool down. I watched as Anna played with some Dolls in the nearby corner.

She noticed I was watching and asked if I wanted to play with her.

"Uh-" I contemplated my options and eventually decided that it wouldn't hurt to distract myself.

. . .

After playing dolls with Anna for what seemed like hours, I eventually got bored and Anna seemed tired. David and Nancy were now playing Connect-4 and making weird looks at each other. I turned as they closed the distance of their mouths from each other.

"Gross...." Anna said and scrunched up her face.

I laughed and got myself some angry glares from David and Nancy.

"I mean- So what do you wanna be when you grow up"? I asked, trying to keep myself from going stir-crazy.

"I wanna be a Princess"! She exclaimed.

"The ones from the fairy tales"? I asked

"YEA"! She shouted excitedly.

"Well, princesses don't shout a lot". I said, chuckling.

"Nuh-uh, Princess Marie shouts a LOT"! She said, getting excessively loud at the last word to emphasize what she meant.

"Well, guess you got your future set". I said with a small hint of sarcasm.

"What are you gonna be when you grow up"? She asked.

I was surprised but quickly thought of an answer.

"I wanna be an Artist". I said.

"The ones that paint"? She asked.

"The ones that make music". I corrected.

"So you're gonna be a Music Man"?? She asked with a hint of excitement.

"Well- I'm not much of a "Music Man" at the moment". I said.

"But you're not grown up yet! You still have a lot of time"! She exclaimed, giggling.

"Well- I suppose". I said, a smile forming on my face.

After a while, she fell asleep on my lap and I decided to see if my phone still worked.

Bingo.

I still had internet apparently.

I quickly typed out what you're currently reading right now. Does anyone have any clue what's happening? I don't think this is going to end anytime soon so i'll keep you all updated on my situation.
