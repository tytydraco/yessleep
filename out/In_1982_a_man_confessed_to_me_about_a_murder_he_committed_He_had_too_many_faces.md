  

This was when I was a county sheriff in a small town called Champs Block. This small town in rural Arkansas. A forgotten town in the middle of nowhere. So remote that most people in the surrounding area don’t know of its existence. The biggest thing that happened in this town was a drug bust of a singular drug dealer on the corner of Washington and Columbus.  This wasn’t even connected to a big organization but just a twenty year old growing marijuana in his mothers basement. 

Anyway on the 9th of August 1982 at around 11:30, I was sitting in the small sheriff’s office, underused and underkept, when the call came in. My deputy answered the phone. The rattly voice mumbled over the phone and my deputy Jefferson's, a skinny, clean shaven man who was surprisingly strong, face dropped. He soon regained the composure and placed the phone back in his holster. His face told the story before his lips could crease.  

“We may need to call in the CSI. This one seems to be some sort of… I don't know what.”

He did not dare to elaborate. We called in the slumbering crime scene investigators. We came to an old barn, followed by the CSI team. What we found was alien to my small town. We opened the rickety, red doors to a similar red inside but it wasn’t painted. It was a man’s scarlet insides. We found the man lying on a heap of red, red hay, breached from their ropes. The remains of a man, ribs split open into a deathly butterfly. The lungs spread to opposite sides of the barn. The heart at my feet. His face, his goddamn face split down the middle like if he had a butcher knife hitting his face hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times. 

The person who called him in was sobbing in the corner. I knelt down next to her and after she stopped blubbering and shaking, she explained that she was his wife. Her name was Maxine Maxwell and the blood fountain was her husband Harrison Maxwell. he went in there in the morning, packing hay into the loft for the day. When he didn’t come back for his evening whisky, she went to check on him. That’s when she found him. 

“Why didn’t you check on him when he didn’t come in for dinner?”

“He misses dinner all the time. He loses track of time but never, ever misses his evening whiskey.”

At this point she loses it, she cries from now until she is asleep at her parents house in Tungsten county. I pick her up and take her to her parents who just pulled up onto the gravel road. I reconvene with my deputy. His eyes are now sunken into his head and the shock ran across his face. 

“What happened here? What could have done this? This is just primal overkill.”

“I don’t know Jefferson but this is definitely a late night and a death penalty.”

“Does the police do free therapy?”

“We don’t even have free health care.”

“Stop on and go across the pond if you want that yah Bobby.”

A short snort was the only symbolism of laughter in that case. The next night after a long day of interviews and wailing families and friends was the first rest of the case. I sat on my old armchair. The crisp, cold leather chilled my uniformed back. I was watching some old series, maybe Magnum PI, while warming my heart with Jack Daniels. As I rested my mead on the back of my chair, the TV turned to static. This grabbed my attention as it peaked my confusion and curiosity. After about ten seconds of random aerial signals, the TV turned to an image of a blank white wall and floor(the ceiling was too high to see) with a small table with an ashtray. Next to this was a wooden chair and sat upon the chair was a man in an expensive looking suit and placed in between two fingers was a cigarette. His head... My god his head was a jumble of faces moulded and welded together. Each a different expression and emotion. The one facing the camera began to speak.

“Hello Jack Manadon, I see you there drinking your hard liquor like a true man. I’ll make this quick, I killed that man in the barn. I eviscerated him at exactly 10:23PM with my own two bare hands. Now, you may be surprised I am telling you this at all but you will never find me. I’ve done this before and I will do this again. Now when you put this into your little police report you will have to put a name on it. I go by many names assigned to many faces, haha little joke. Anyway, you can call me Mr Faces.”

I bent towards the TV, placing my bottle of alcohol on the floor, confused as to what the hell was happening. The so-called ‘Mr Faces’ placed his cigarette to his lips and puffed a small cloud of smoke. 

“Anyway , I'm done here. Bernese go ahead.”

A creak behind me alerted me to a person behind me. Before I could swivel my body to my intruder, I was knocked out cold. I woke up a few hours later to the sound of a morning news broadcast on guess what, the killing of Harrison Maxwell. Once I regained my full consciousness, I whipped out my revolver and searched my house. Nothing. I went to work and told no one of my experience. I soon left that small town, it was never the same again. I moved to a suburban neighbourhood, created an ordinary life for my self and worked for the local police department. The only reason why I am posting this is that it happened again. A house in L.A was found redder than paint. I decided that I needed to get this out there. He did say he would do this again. I have told no one of Mr Faces but I can't keep it in any more.
