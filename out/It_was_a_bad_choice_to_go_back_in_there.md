I always loved exploring abandoned places. The thrill of the unknown, the excitement of discovering something new, it always drew me in. So when I heard about an old asylum on the outskirts of town, I knew I had to go.The asylum had been closed down for decades, but the stories surrounding it never died. Rumors of ghosts, strange occurrences, and unexplainable phenomena had made it a local legend. And as I made my way to the entrance, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

The gates to the asylum were rusted and creaked loudly as I pushed them open. The courtyard was overgrown, and the building itself was imposing, with its tall walls and barred windows. As I stepped inside, I could feel the weight of the history that lay within those walls.I made my way down a long hallway, my footsteps echoing off the walls. The air was musty, and the smell of decay lingered in the air. The silence was deafening, and I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched.

As I walked deeper into the asylum, I began to hear whispers. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but the whispers grew louder and more distinct. They were coming from the walls, the floors, and the ceiling. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as the whispers turned into screams.I tried to run, but the hallway seemed to stretch out forever. The screams grew louder, and I could feel something tugging at my clothes. It was as if the asylum was alive, and it was trying to drag me down with it.

Finally, I reached a door, and I burst through it, gasping for air. But what I saw inside made me wish I had stayed in the hallway. The room was filled with decaying bodies, their eyes fixed on me, their mouths open in silent screams. The whispers had turned into a deafening roar, and I knew that I was not alone.I tried to run, but something grabbed me from behind, pulling me back into the room. The door slammed shut, and the room was plunged into darkness. I could feel cold fingers wrapping around my throat, and I knew that I was going to die.

But just as I thought it was over, the grip on my throat loosened, and I fell to the ground, gasping for air. The door to the room swung open, and I ran as fast as I could, out of the asylum and into the night.For days after the incident, I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Everywhere I went, I could feel eyes on me, and the whispers followed me wherever I went. I was terrified, and I knew that I had to find out more about the asylum.

So I did some research and discovered that the asylum had a dark past. It was rumored that the doctors who ran the asylum were experimenting on their patients, and that many of them had died in horrific ways. The asylum had been closed down after a patient uprising, where the inmates had taken control and killed many of the staff.I knew that I had to go back to the asylum, to confront my fears and to find out what really happened there. So I made my way back to the entrance, armed with a flashlight and a sense of determination.

As I walked down the same hallway where I had been attacked, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. But this time, I was prepared. I had brought a crucifix and some holy water, and I was ready to face whatever evil spirits were haunting the asylum.

As I made my way deeper into the asylum, I was unable to breath, I slowly started felling dizzy until I fainted and collapsed on the floor . The next thing I saw when  I opened my eyes was a doctor taking my intestine out of my body.
