The boy pulled out a mirror out of that magical sac, and placed it in between the two of us. " No matter what you see in the mirror, dont scream, and dont move", he stretched his hand out for me to hold them.


 Both of hand in hand now, his abnormally long fingers, wrapping around my hands, he looked at me, "Think of something you love, something that makes you feel extremely happy and after being done look into the mirror".


I closed my eyes and started thinking about my boyfriend Jack, the two of us laying under an open sky on a beach, the beautiful moon and the twinkling starts. My head on jack's chest, the two of us having the best time of our lives, stargazing. Jack running his fingers through my hair, smiling. It was perfect, surreal.


After a while, reality hit me and i realised what i'm doing right now. Focusing on the task ahead i slowly started opening my eyes and looked directly at the mirror. On the mirror, i saw myself, it was me, my face but something was wrong with me, my eyes looked sunken, my cheeks way too hollow, i looked dishelved and i-ii looked like a little girl, a younger, emaciated version of myself. 


i started shaking, something wasnt right with me, i started feeling a weird impending feeling of doom, my stomach clenched and my heart skipped a beat, i looked at the little boy but the person i was looking at didnt look like a little boy now, there in front of me , was a grown man sitting down looking at me. 


He had a sympathetic look on his face. He eyes not sunken in anymore instead they looked like the prettiest eyes i have ever seen with striking blue irises. He was a good looking man, not a frail, exhausted looking little boy. 


"Who are you? wh- what is happening?", i asked.


The man lowered his gaze and started talking, " i'm sorry i had to do it. I lied to you. There is no other world , and i am a human myself. There is this curse, the cause of it all. I was just like you, a common man going on a night drive on a fateful night, when i came across a little girl, frail and helpless, i took her in to help her and then i was somehow convinced to perform the ritual, in order to be able to get back home".


"The girl lied to me the same way i lied to you, she passed her curse to me and i had to keep wandering for not just 5 years but more than 50 years. After the curse was passed on to me, the girl got back into her real body, her 20 something year old self, She had been walking around and wandering for more than 40 years, waiting for someone to see her and take her in".


"This curse has been going on for thousands of years passing from one unfortunate person to another and you happen to be one of us. There is no cure to it, you just have to keep going until someone is able to see you, you become visible to them. It can take anywhere from 10 years to 100 years. The only way to free yourself is to trap someone else in it". 


The boy looked back at me, "You are cursed now, you have to keep wandering the same way now until someone going on a drive alone at night sees you and decides to take you in. i'm sorry i cant help you, but tha- thankyou for saving me from this agony and suffering". The man carefully freed his hands and got up looking at his arms, hands and body as if he couldnt believe his eyes. 


" This cant be true, you are lying to me, tell me this is a horrible joke, tell me you are lyingggg!",i screamed, getting on my feet. 


"Look at yourself, you dont look like yourself anymore, you are trapped into a little girl's body now, this cannot be a joke", he said. 


i looked down on my abnormal looking hands, palms too small, fingers too long, my little frail stick like arms, my short skinny legs, my weird out of proportion little feet. I touched my face with my hands, it felt too small, too bony, i wasnt myself anymore. "This is all true, i am curss- cursed! i am cursed!", i thought to myself. 


The man offered a sad smile once more and began to walk away. " You cant do this to me, how dare you! come back! you cant do this!!", i screamed. The man didnt look back and kept going. 


The next thing i know is waking up on the side of the road, alone. 


i have been wandering around for a month now, nobody can see me, i am invisible to everyone else, they cant see me, hear me or feel me. 


i guess i'm just going to keep walking until i meet someone to pass this curse on to. Till then stay safe, and if you see me walking on the side of a road on a rainy night, beware!.
