Korelo looked at me for a moment and then said “You remind me of myself Michael. What you are is an agent of death. You may not know it, and you may choose to disagree. But it is what it is.”

“I am nothing like you.” I shot back.

Korelo then flicked his finger and digital copies of a police report began appearing out of thin air. It was related to the car accident I was involved in as a 9 year old kid.

Korelo began speaking again. ”You threw such a big tantrum when your dad did not stop by your favorite ice cream parlor that he was eventually forced to turn around his car, to get you what you wanted. That delay caused your family and your cousin’s family to come face to face with a drunk truck driver. I don’t need to complete the rest of the story for you.”

I just sat there in shock. He had managed to prick a raw nerve in me. I had never shared that part of the story with anyone, apart from the police officer who had interrogated me shortly after the accident. Not with my wife. And not with Henry either. I was afraid he would shut me out of his life for good, if he ever came to know that I was in some way indirectly responsible for the accident. The guilt was just too much for me to be able to share it with anyone else.

But Korelo was not done yet. He continued to plunge the dagger into me. “Your wife fell sick with cancer within two years of her marrying you. Your cousin wound up dead because you brought my business to his door step. Your security guard friend Joe ended up dead because he was forced to take on your shift. God only knows what else I will find out about you, if I keep looking.”

I couldn’t take it anymore and I just wanted it to end. “What are you going to do to me?” I asked him.

Korelo said, “You are worth a lot of money Michael. I am going to sell you to one of the research groups that study people like you. They will test your blood, analyse your DNA, and pick and prod your brain to understand every minute aspect of your life. Right from what time you wake up in the morning, to the kinds of dreams you experience, to how you conduct yourself in different situations, to the kind of girls you like to date – everything about your personality and decision making abilities will be studied under a microscope. They will then create clones out of you to be used as a potent weapon in war strategy and espionage related activities.”

For the first time I laughed out loud at the bizarreness of it all. It was all just getting a little bit too much.

“Captain, you give me way too much credit. I might be unlucky in life. But to say all the things you just did, is bit of an overreach. I am just an ordinary guy with an unremarkable life. There are a lot guys like me out there.”

“That may be true. But I don’t need you to be remarkable. All I have to do is put you in the orbit of people who can do remarkable things. And you will eventually figure out a way to bring them down - knowingly or unknowingly, wittingly or unwittingly.”

I just sat there staring at Korelo. He seems to have gotten it all figured out, and was also quite smug about. Nothing I say was ever going to convince him. I didn’t like him from the beginning, but I truly despised him now.

Meanwhile Buster had woken up a little while back and was sitting next to me. He started wagging his tail when I looked at him. That really broke my heart. My fate was already sealed, I knew that. But I didn’t want him to have to suffer.

“Do you want me to spare your dog?” Korelo asked me smiling. I just stared back at him. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction of saying yes, but I couldn’t hide the desperation in my eyes.

He then pressed a button on his armrest, and a display popped up in front of him. He keyed in a couple of commands and started slowly turning a knob. A strange kind of sound suddenly emerged from nowhere.

Buster immediately let out a loud howl, and ran across the room. It was clear the noise was hurting his ears, and was an assault on his senses. He curled up in a corner of the room and was howling in pain.

I tried desperately to free myself, but my efforts were proving futile. Korelo was looking at me and Buster alternatively, and continued to slowly turn the knob. He was really enjoying the show.

Buster yelped in pain. He was really hurting now, and my inability to help him was tearing me up from the inside. At that point, all I could think about was Adam’s little note. I was desperate enough to try anything.

I slid my little finger by the side while the rest remained on the armrest. I tried to use the pointed edge of the armrest to create a wedge between my little finger and the remaining fingers. And then I jerked my wrist as hard I could, and my finger dislocated. A sharp pain shot through my body, but I didn’t care.

By this point I was simply hoping for a miracle, almost expecting angels to descend from the Heavens and save our lives.

But Buster suddenly went quiet. And then to my horror, his body began to seize. He started experiencing some kind of major epileptic fit.

I looked up to see Korelo looking equally surprised. Then his expression changed.

It changed from surprise to shock to complete panic.

He started screaming “No ….. no …..noooo!!!”

As soon he uttered those words, I saw the lights around his spaceship begin to flicker. The first to go was the giant display in front of us.

And then in a matter of seconds, the entire spaceship was plunged into complete darkness. The resulting silence only punctured by Korelo screaming a barrage of instructions at his panic stricken crew.

The power came back a few moments later, and I saw Buster motionless on the floor. He had coughed up a lot of blood, and was lying in a puddle of his own vomit.

A reservoir of anger was building up in me and I wanted to just explode. I looked up to see Korelo. But he was busy living his own version of hell.

His gaze was completely fixated outwards. I turned around to look outside, and could see two spaceships at a distance floating mid air. They were no longer invisible.

“You … you are responsible for this. What did you do?” korelo yelled with his finger pointed at me.

I just sat there stupefied, and completely clueless. I genuinely didn’t understand what was happening around me.

“Look. Look at that …” he said pointing to Buster’s little puddle on the floor.

And then I noticed it for the first time. There was a small black ball lying in his vomit, and it was emitting a blue light from within.

“Where did you get that?” he asked me sounding really furious. I just gave him a blank look.

Korelo sank back in his chair. He just simply stared at me. His single eye looking vacant and lost, struggling to come to terms at how things were suddenly crumbling around him. Like, I was somehow the reason behind his current predicament.

As much as I was enjoying watching him squirm in his chair, frankly I thought he was giving me way too much credit. All I did was lean back in a large comfortable chair and bust my pinkie!

Korelo was then alerted by his subordinate about a new problem. Two ballistic missiles had been fired from different directions, and both were headed straight for the spaceship.

He immediately began giving instructions to his crew. I could sense they were preparing for an evacuation. But the spaceship struggled to lift off. It simply didn’t have the required thrust to get it done. It went a few feet high up in the air, and then dipped back to its original position.

What ever happened to Buster, seemed to have somehow severely messed up their technology. I didn’t understand how or why, but I continued to watch fully riveted.

Korelo then issued a new set of instructions to his staff. I could see from the screen, a large force shield had been deployed around the ship. His two smaller spaceships now set off in the direction of the missiles.

Right at that moment, I also heard a very familiar noise ringing in my ear, and my suspicions were soon confirmed. The fighter jets were also back up in the air.

I could see three F35’s hurtling through the air headed straight for the ship, ready to take aim. They were probably from the airfield that is not very far from the base. One of Korelo’s ships turned around mid way to deal with the fighter planes.

I know our jets are fast and fly at supersonic speeds, but Korelo’s spaceships were mindbogglingly quick. Even for the untrained eye, they looked 10 times bigger and traveled at least 30 times faster.

The spaceship traversed the distance at an astonishing speed, and started firing at the F-35 that was in front of it. The pilot barely had any time to react, and the jet immediately exploded in flames.

The other two planes tried to lock in on their target to launch another missile salvo, but the spaceship maneuvered deftly to thwart the attack. It then looped back in the air to suddenly insert itself between the two planes, and simultaneously opened fire at the both the F-35’s. The remaining fighter planes went down in flames as well.

Meanwhile Korelo’s other spaceship had already shot down one of the ballistic missiles, and was enroute to take down the next. As it got closer, it began to slow down and gain altitude.

When the missile went past it from below, the spaceship followed after it, and then turned around mid-air, changing the trajectory of the missile along with it.

It was as if the missile got hooked with an invisible lasso rope as it suddenly curved through the air, and was being yanked from up above by the ship to set a new course. I was hoping the missile would somehow detonate, taking down the ship with it, but it faithfully dragged itself along the path set by the spaceship.

The ship later abruptly stopped at one of the nearby cities, and the missile suddenly plummeted to ground, triggering a massive explosion. Their target was a large power grid.

It was clear Captain Korelo was sending a message to my own government, and warning them of what was to come if they persisted with this line of attack.

Before I could discern any more details, the display on the screen changed to show a map with 7 areas marked in red. Korelo’s ship was at the center, and the rest of the map covered the entire geographic radius around it.

I suspect the areas marked in red were military bases or airfields that were in immediate proximity. The spaceships flew over these locations, and air dropped bombs to further delay the possibility of a swift counterattack.

The two spacecrafts then headed back to protect Korelo’s ship and the Captain began relaying a new set of commands to his crew. Within moments, I saw a large opening in both the subsidiary spaceships, and they released around 20 cylindrical objects into the atmosphere.

Each cylinder was at least 15 meters high and 5 meters wide, with large curved metallic rods on either side that were pointed upwards like antennas. The cylinders were equidistant from each other and were slowly circling the spaceship in a clockwise direction.

The cylinders then attached themselves to Korelo’s spacecraft, and the metal rods began their descent. The rods extended horizontally to establish a connection with a cylinder on either side, creating a tight, bracelet-like formation encircling the mother ship.

Meanwhile the other two spaceships now were flanking the mother ship, and they looked ready, and in position.

‘But ready to do what? What is going to happen?’ I began to ask myself.

Korelos' voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his expression serious as he directed his crew with urgency. Systematically, they initiated the shutdown of various systems, reducing the ship to its core functions. Even the lighting was dimmed to save energy, leaving the large room almost in darkness, except for the vibrant glow of multiple display screens.

As I starred at the giant display, I could see my own government was still determined to go on the full offensive. The screen was dotted with a cluster of at least 20 fighter jets from different directions that were headed towards the spaceship.

The planes had taken off from bases that were a little far away and outside the immediate radius of Korelo’s ship. My estimate was they were at least 15-20 minutes away, which I guess gave the aliens some time to plan their next offensive.

Korelo’s crew on the other hand, had managed to deploy a force shield that was large enough to contain all the three spacecrafts. Then the two smaller spaceships that were already in position, now started circling Korelo’s ship.

Both simultaneously emitted a large beam of electric charge that was targeted towards the metallic rods attached to the cylinders. The beam resembled the likes of a thick electric rope that just lashed at the rods, delivering a huge surcharge of power. The continuous back and forth motion of the ships created the impression of an intense churn-like activity.

 Looking at what was happening outside; I wondered if any of us would even survive.

‘Will the ship be able to handle this load? Or will it just explode at any moment?’

I looked at Korelo’s crew just to observe their reaction. Their gaze however was transfixed on the large screen in front of them. There was a marker on the display that was slowly inching upwards.

‘They were building an alternate power source…. and it looked like their plan was working!’

‘So what were they going to do if they managed to reach full power capacity? Are they going to launch an offensive or will they just leave?’ I wondered.

In between all that commotion, something suddenly caught the corner of my eye. I wasn’t exactly sure what it was, but it happened really fast. It was like a sudden flash of electric discharge in a remote corner of the room.

I strained my eyes in the partially lit space to get a better look, but could see nothing unusual. It was probably just electrical arcing related to some equipment.

The charging from the ships went on uninterrupted for the next 10-15 minutes as they continued to deliver a huge output of electric charge to the mothership. The uncomfortable silence in the room was only broken when Korelo’s voice blared across the speaker.

I guess it was him reacting to the enemy aircrafts that had now closed in on his spaceship. There were at least 14 of them, and they had already reached the edge of the force shield. They immediately opened fire, but the shield so far was holding firm, and managed to withstand the coordinated attack. The rest of the fighter planes were also on their way, and were probably only a few minutes away.

And then it happened again; the same spark of electric charge that appeared and dissolved at a moment’s notice, this time in the opposite corner of the room.

I wondered if it was just me imagining things or if my eyes were playing tricks? Nevertheless it recurred, in this instance a mere 20 feet in front of me, accompanied also by a crackling sound and then followed by darkness again.

But I managed to catch a glimpse this time. A brief flash that suddenly illuminated the silhouette, of a familiar figure lurking in the darkness.

‘Was that ….was that Buster?’ I asked myself in shock, the hair on my arms standing on end. I looked back at the place where I saw him die, his body still remained on the floor lifeless.

Then there was another loud crackle in the center of the hall. The electrical discharge becoming continuous and more intense with each passing second.

And there he was… sitting upright. It was Buster no doubt. And yet he looked different. He was no longer made of flesh and bones, but what I saw was rather a strange neon version of him.

All the electrical discharge that was happening around him was only helping to add more depth to his form, filling him up with a hue of white and blue. He looked me in the eye for a fleeting moment, and then suddenly dissolved into thin air with a soft bang.

I nervously glanced at Korelo and the rest of his crew. They witnessed it too, and the dazed wary look on their faces said it all.

The uneasy silence however was quickly broken by the urgent beeps emanating from the giant screen. The force shield was showing signs of depletion after being under continuous attack from air dropped bombs, rockets and gun fire. The pilots were obviously giving it their all, but the shield was still managing to hold fort to the onslaught. The remaining fighter jets were also quickly closing in on their target.

To add to Korelo’s woes, I also spotted two new projectiles on screen, which I assume were missile launches from my own government.

Meanwhile, I could still see flashes of discharges occurring all around the large oval room. But the entire crew was glued at work, and Korelo at this point was literally barking at his staff.

One of the two smaller ships abruptly stopped emitting the beam, and exited the force shield to create a diversion, and the fighter jets went after it in full force.

The spaceship found itself surrounded and outnumbered by fighter jets in all directions and came under heavy fire. It retaliated by firing indiscriminately at the jets while also bulldozing the ones that simply came in its way, sustaining significant damages in the process. It managed to take down 14 jets in under 5 minutes before going down in flames, buying Korelo and his team some more time before the next assault.

The other spaceship that was already circling the mother ship, now picked up its pace considerably, and began to emit an even larger output of charge.

Next Korelo turned his swivel chair around to face the center of the room to deal with the new in-house problem. He said something on his intercom and keyed in a couple of commands on the console of his armrest. Suddenly the entire hall was bathed in bright amber light.

The amber light enabled me to see Buster properly for the first time since his passing. He looked at odds, unable to come to terms with his new ghost like form, hovering around like an astral projection. He was running scared, and confused from the electrical charges that were chasing him like a shadow.

Every time he slowed down, the electrical arcing would pick up in intensity, which would force him further to keep moving to stop the build-up. I could see him howl and bark with fear not knowing how to find relief. But no sounds were coming out of him in this state. And yet, he maintained a safe distance from me to ensure my own safety.

Three aliens rushed into the room wielding batons, and they were the same ones who attacked me and Buster at Henry’s place. They surrounded Buster from all sides and cautiously began to close in on him. There was another alien right behind them, holding onto a glass-dome like object that looked big enough to confine a dog.

Buster looked menacingly at his captors, baring his fangs at them, as they determinedly tried to close in on his space. However, with no body of his own, there was little he could do to defend himself. He began to retreat carefully, taking a few steps back, stopping just a couple of feet away from a large operations console located directly behind him.

And then he did something beautiful, which dogs normally to do to rid themselves of anxiety. Harmless as it was at that moment, it brought a smile to my face for the first time over the wretched last couple of days.
