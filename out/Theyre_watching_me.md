I’ve been seeing things lately. Just out of the corner of my eye. Watching me. Yet every time I turn my head to catch them, they’re quick to disappear, vanishing behind the couch, a chair, a wall ,sometimes even the lamp beside my bed. It’s been happening for a while now. At first, it was only for the briefest of moments so fleeting that I could almost convince myself I was imagining it.

But they’ve grown bolder. They linger longer now. They want me to see them. They want me to know they’re watching.

I’m starting to get scared.

Because even in sleep, I can’t escape them.

In my dreams, they don’t bother hiding. They stand in the open, their eyes locked onto me, unblinking. They’re hideous things. Black, jagged silhouettes with twisted spines protruding sharply from their backs. Their limbs are too long spindly and uneven, jointed in places that shouldn’t exist. Their mouths hang open, deep bottomless pits that shriek constantly.And their eyes - God, their eyes are white, soulless voids. Blank. As if they see nothing at all. Yet somehow, I know they see everything. Me. My fear. My exhaustion.

In the real world, they still scurry and slither back into the shadows when I turn my head. But they’re getting slower. Sloppy, even. I can almost catch a glimpse of their full, true form before they dart away. Like they want to be seen.

I made a mistake yesterday.

I googled what they might be. Most of the results were useless. Telling me they’re just floaters, that I’m a Schizo, that maybe it’s just sleep paralysis. Then some article suggesting it was just my tired brain playing tricks on me.

But then I found a page about shadow people.

Beings that feed on negative energy.

This I could get behind because I’ve been in a pretty dark place lately depressed, withdrawn, barely leaving my apartment. Maybe that’s why they came. Maybe they were drawn to the bitterness in me, gnawing on it like carrion birds.

So today, I tried to fight back.

I forced myself to get out of bed. I cleaned the apartment with upbeat music blaring in the background. I posted positive affirmations around the house. I laughed even if it was forced and kept my thoughts as light as I could. I filled my space with as much manufactured joy as possible.

And it worked.

I barely saw them while I was awake.

For the first time in weeks, they kept their distance.

I should’ve known better.

When I fell asleep, they were waiting.

And they were furious.

They shrieked louder than they ever had before horrid, bone-rattling wails that felt like they were vibrating inside my skull. Their blackened, spiny arms stretched out for me, clawing and grasping with renewed hunger. They were faster now, slithering through the void between us in jerking, stuttering motions, their limbs snapping violently with each movement. They came at me from all sides, and for the first time they actually attempted to touch me their skeletal fingers grazing my skin, dragging along my throat, my legs, my face. Their claws were cold. Wet.

I thrashed in my sleep, trying to push them away. But the more I struggled, the louder they screamed. Their eyeless faces stretched wider and wider until there was nothing left of them but shrieking, gaping holes.

I woke up gasping.

My sheets were shredded. Long, jagged tears ran down the fabric deep enough to expose the mattress beneath. I stared at them for a long time, my pulse roaring in my ears, before I dared to look down at myself.

Scratches. All over my arms. My legs. My chest. Deep, angry welts where their claws had dragged over my skin.  I threw my self off the side of bed and turned to the mirror rested on the floor beside it my hands were trembling violently, but I forced them up to my neck and my stomach dropped.

There were bruises there. Fresh.

Finger-shaped bruises.

I don’t remember waking up. I don’t remember doing this to myself. And I sure as hell don’t remember grabbing my own throat hard enough to leave marks.

I sat on the floor for hours, knees pulled to my chest, lights on, refusing to move. I could feel them watching me from the corners. Lurking just behind the dresser. Clinging to the space between the door and the wall. They didn’t run this time.

They didn’t need to.

They know I am too tired to fight them.

I pray I can stay awake tonight.
