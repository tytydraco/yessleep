We huddled next to the tablet tracking Aurora’s location, excited at there finally being a way to stop her and bring her back.

“Where is she again?”

“She’s stopping at Cancún.”

“Alright guys! It’s decided then, we’re going to Cancún.” Diana commanded, “Get your items, and don’t forget to bring your weapons. We might be gone for a long time, so pack accordingly and meet me in an hour. We need to stop her quickly before she moves on further away!”

“We don’t have that many things anyways.” Sam quipped. And he was technically right. After all, we dedicated every waking moment to this project. We even lived in the very same building we worked in!

Regardless, an hour later, we brought along bags of everything we needed on the journey to capture a runaway superhuman. Immediately, we hit the road with our trusty car, probably breaking a few traffic rules in our haste to reach the airport and board our flight quickly. As I stepped into the expansive airport building, I said, “Hey Diana, I have a question.”

“What is it?”

“How do we even disguise the gun?”

“You’re supposed to have disassembled it earlier! That way they won’t notice it! Did you?”

After a minute of furiously digging through my bag, I confirmed that the gun was, in fact, disassembled. Heaving a sigh of relief, we sprinted to our plane, not wanting to waste a second of time. After all, imagine what would happen if we delayed and let Aurora escape again!

In the plane, we began to strategise a plan on how to get Aurora.

“Yo Sam”, I said, beckoning to the tablet in his palms, “Where is she now?”

“Huh? Oh yeah, I’ll check that out.”, he responded. He plugged the charger in, turned on the tablet and opened the location tracker app. Zooming in the map, he said, “She seems to be somewhere in the Hotel Zone in Cancún. Hopefully she stays there until we get there!”

“That’s good”, I said, “It’s familiar territory for me.”

The rest of the two hour plane trip went by uneventfully, until we reached Cancún. Exiting the airport, we immediately jumped into a taxi hired by Diana. Of course she had everything arranged beforehand… including another plan to get Aurora.

“Here, take these.”, she said, handing out some white ID cards. When I got mine, I took a closer look at it and realised what she was planning.

“Special Agent, Margaret Sherwood?”, I blurted out in confusion.

“Of course! We’ll pretend to be from the FBI. There isn’t any other way to get in or ask for information without trouble.”

“But isn’t that… illegal? Faking our identity?” Raj asked.

“We have no other way to do this!” Diana replied.

After that, there was no further planning until we were dropped off outside the hotel. It was a decently sized hotel with around 10 floors and a small concierge. And it looked familiar…

Oh wait. It was the hotel I went to several years ago with my friends.

“Alright, two of you stay here, and I’ll tell you where to go depending on Aurora’s location. Oh, and I’ll need someone to come ambush wherever her room is.”, Diana explained.

“I’ll come with you”, I volunteered, “I’ve been here a few times before. I know the layout.”

Diana stared at me suspiciously for a moment, before responding, “Alright then. Come in with me.”

Walking into the concierge, we stopped by the receptionist, and did exactly as we planned. “Hello, we are Diana Mulligan and Margaret Sherwood from the FBI. Is there a person of first name Aurora staying here? We require this for an investigation.”

“Hold on, I need to call the manager.”

I nervously waited for her response. Eventually, the manager came out. We repeated our statement, and flashed our ID cards at the manager. Luckily, she eventually bought our story.

“We have a booking from an Aurora Mulligan. The unit is #05-011.”

We thanked her, before heading on into the hotel with a keycard. Next to me, Diana texted Raj a quick ‘go to the back and see if she escapes’.

“Ugh, the nerve of her to use my surname of all things!” Diana vented as we entered the lift.

I, meanwhile, was flooded with the old memories of staying here with my friends, almost twenty years ago. Regardless, I didn’t have time for these things, I had a job to do!

As we approached the room labelled ‘#05-011’, I raised my hand to knock at the door, but Diana stopped me.

“No”, she whispered, “we need to storm in and get her if she’s in there.”. As my heart roared in my ears, she counted to three and slid the keycard in the lock. Immediately, we shoved open the door and ran in… only to find no one.

Ok, not no one at all, but…

“Oh my god! Who is that!”, I shrieked as I looked up. From the fan, a body was hanging from a noose, eyes bulging out from its sockets. His hair, too, was matted with blood from some sort of head injury.

Diana, too, seemed sufficiently shocked. Mouth agape, she stared at the gory scene above. “What did she even do here?”, she muttered. In our shock, we didn’t notice Aurora creeping in.

“Looking at something?”, she asked from behind me.

“You- get her!”, I yelled, startled as we whirled around and aimed at her.

Faster than I could anticipate, she knocked the gun out of my hands and shoved me against the wall before pushing a pistol next to my head. “Nope, too late!”, she said with glee.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Diana take aim at Aurora again.

“Nooooo don’t shoot!”, I yelled involuntarily. I was in the range of fire too, after all!

“What the hell did you even do to this guy!”, Diana asked angrily.

She flicked her green eyes up dismissively. “Nothing much. I have all his stuff and he outlived his usefulness anyways.”.

“Anyways, now I’m done with getting my passport.”. She flashed a maroon passport that said ‘European Union, Republic of Bulgaria’.

“...W- w- what the hell? Y- you need to stop and come with us now!”, I stuttered, finally finding my voice.

“Oh, really? And waste the effort I took finding someone to counterfeit this?” she responded, waving the passport in my face. “Oh, and like the name here? Jane Mulligan?”, she asked Diana mockingly, putting particular emphasis on the ‘Mulligan’.

Just then, the man hanging above me groaned, still horrifically alive in some way or the other. For the first time, Aurora appeared to be caught off her feet.

She rubbed her chin in thinking, the same way I saw Diana do back in the lab when she was puzzling over a report. “How are you still alive even?”, she mused coldly.

Before I could even process what happened, she deftly pulled out a kitchen knife from her pocket and flicked it upwards, stabbing him straight in the heart. He screamed one last guttural scream as blood squirted like a fountain from his body, before finally dying .

“Well, the security guards must be coming soon. Goodbye!”, she said with childlike glee, before hastily grabbing a brown duffel bag from a corner table and sliding out of the window. Multiple thuds from the building ledges could be heard outside, so she was definitely going down to the ground.

As I stood there frozen, Diana shook me out of my stupor. “Margaret! We have to leave now! Before anyone else comes in!”. Heeding her advice, I tucked my gun back into my bag (thankfully, she didn’t take it with her) before hurriedly sneaking out of the room and hotel building. Outside, we heard gunshot sounds from the area below her window.

“That’s got to be Raj and Sam! Hurry!”

Indeed, by the time we got to the back corner of the hotel, Raj and Sam were already firing at Aurora, trying to halt her escape. She, however, managed to perceive and dodge every bullet shot at her.

Instinctively sprinting to their location, I took out my gun and began firing at her madly, the sounds of the bullets ringing in my ears. Despite her not returning fire, we still could not get a single shot on her.

Even Sam, who was almost right next to her, couldn’t get a straight shot at her. Why couldn’t he shoot her?

Oh, right. His hands were shaking. Hell, his entire body was trembling! I made a mental note to ask him about that later.

Grabbing onto the wall of the hotel compound, Aurora deftly scaled over it and threw herself over. A thud was heard on the other end as she landed hard on her feet, before leaping away into the road.

“We can’t chase her like this! Get a taxi or something!” Raj suggested as he ran for the exit. The rest of us, too, began running for the exit in our pursuit to find her before she got too far away.

“Sam!” I yelled when I saw him still standing at the back of the hotel, shell-shocked. “Come with us!”. Startled, he too followed us out.

“Taxi!” Diana yelled out. The white car she gestured at immediately stopped, and the driver poked his head out. “Where going?”

As we climbed in, she explained, “Go straight for now! Just follow my directions!”

By this time, of course, Aurora was already way ahead of us. After several twists, turns, and twenty minutes, I finally noticed something I never expected to see.

On the pavement, when I looked out, I saw Aurora’s blonde head disappear behind a corner.

“There she is!”, I cried out. “Turn left, we have her!”

However, when we turned there was no sign of anyone having been there.

“Look at the tracker! She ran off the main roads!” Diana alerted. “We have to do this on foot!”.

Immediately, we bolted out of the car after Diana hurriedly fished out some peso notes from her pocket for the driver. In the muggy midday Cancún heat, we scampered around shady run-down alleys and narrow side roads lined with houses in an attempt to follow the tracker, but we never saw Aurora anywhere!

Next thing we knew, she was kilometres away from us and at the airport. Or, at least, that’s what the tracker said. As the estimated altitude on her tracker rose higher and higher, we knew that she had once again given us the slip and ran.

“Damn it”, complained Raj, as we sat in a small restaurant eating tacos. “She got us good, and now she’s off to some random corner of the world again!”.

“Yeah, that’s true”, I added, “we don’t even know where she’s going given the direction the tracker is showing!”

Just then, Diana’s phone rang in her pocket. “Hold on guys, I have to go answer this call.”. As she stepped out, we looked at each other in bewilderment. Who would even call her, particularly at this time?

A few minutes of talking later, she walked in with significantly more tension in her step.

“Who was it?”, I asked curiously.

“An agent from the corp, apparently.”

“Which corp?”

“You know, the one whose dime we’re travelling on?”

“Oh right.”

“Anyways”, interjected Raj, “What did they even say?”

“They said that they were aware of the situation and would support us when we needed it. They also authorised us to kill Aurora if needed. Oh, and they don’t want us to contact the police.”

“They don’t?” Sam asked. “Why? We need to let them know”

“I’m not sure, but orders are orders.”, Diana brusquely replied. While it was evident that Sam disapproved of this command, he did not oppose it too much.

“And one more thing. They have figured out her next destination.”, she continued.

“Where is it?”

“Istanbul.”
