The first time I encountered Motel Evergreen was on my way to visit a friend up north. I’d been stuck in traffic for almost two hours, and I’d made it a little more than three before the sky had started to darken. Most others would’ve taken their chances and braved the night, but not me. 3 months ago, I’d run into a chunk of bumper in the middle of the night that took out my front tire, and I'd braved the rest of it in my car waiting for a tow truck to come save my ass in the morning. I certainly wasn’t about to do that again. I’d started scanning the night sky before a single sign caught my attention; “Next Exit for Motel Evergreen”.   

I’d thought it was a funny name, and then nothing else as I pulled into the lot. A single red corolla sat near the manager’s office, and the parking lot was completely barren otherwise. I pushed open the door into the main lobby, and the immediate rush of warm air was a nice respite from the biting cold outside. A soft melody rang out throughout the lobby as I sat and waited, something familiar yet something I couldn’t nearly put my finger on.  



I still remember the first time we met clear as day, we’d exchanged pleasantries, and she’d mentioned that the motel was always empty, I guess she wasn’t really used to company, but I stayed for a bit and chatted with her, and confused her dog as a he instead of a she. Layla, I think her name was. The pup had been given a prominent spot on the reception counter, so much so that I’d noticed it the first time I’d stepped in. There was also a massive clock that simply displayed the date in the lobby, and it read August the 7th, I’d only noticed it when I’d turned around to leave the reception counter. The motel room was rather quaint, vintage furniture and a bed that creaked under my weight, an old steam radiator sat in the corner, beside a fading brown armchair. As I stood in the shower, the warning she gave me echoed in my mind, “Don’t look at the peephole past 12am”. 

 

I had a peculiar dream that night, I’d been discussing with an old man about an old kit lens that he once had, it was something he loved, and he’d venture around the city, taking various shots of it from different angles. But one day, he’d gotten a new lens, and the lens lay forgotten. He’d gone around the city trying to recreate those exact shots that he’d taken before, but to no avail, they would all come out ever so slightly different from what he’d wanted. And it was so long ago, he said, he’d forgotten where that lens had gone, and he’d never gotten it back.  

 

The next day was freezing, almost absurdly cold, but yet, there she was, making breakfast the first thing in the morning. We’d talked a little, and I’d recognized The Strokes on her playlist, after which she sheepishly admitted that she put on her own personal playlist to pass the time. And why would she not, she’d stated multiple times that almost nobody passed through here. I asked her what she did otherwise to pass the time, and she said cleaning and asked if I wanted to join, a little mischief in her tone. I declined but offered to stop by again soon. She smiled politely and said most people wouldn’t, and I laughed and said I wouldn’t be most people then.  

 

We talked a little more, about her dog, I think, about how she missed her and how old she was getting. I wondered how often she’d gone to visit the lil terrier. It was obvious she meant a lot to her. I’d never had any animals myself, nor did I really care for them, but the way she spoke about that dog would’ve made me reconsider. She’d seemed so quiet at first, but the familiarity with which she’d spoken to me. It made me wonder if we knew each other from somewhere.  

 

The next time I encountered the motel was when I’d turned off the highway the next day to get gas, and as the hues of pink and purple rolled in across the horizon, there it was, the red corolla parked outside the manager’s office, and the parking lot completely barren of any other car. Her face lit up as she saw that I was back so soon, and I felt a little flutter in my heart. We talked a little about nothing, and I’d complained about her monotony of the trip. I’d asked what she’d been doing here in the middle of nowhere, and according to her, she’d been working there to save up for a degree in veterinary studies. There was a certain way in which her eyes lit up as she talked about it. Before I’d left, she’d also given me a small clay flower, a token of gratitude for keeping my promise, she’d said. This time, she’d also given me the same warning as before, and it’d felt a little odder than the first. As I left however, I’d noticed the same clock in the lobby, its date never changing, August the 7th.  

 

It was about 7 when I’d ventured out of the motel, this time to the nearby gas station to fill the couple of gas canisters I’d kept in the trunk just for emergencies. And I found it odd that the gas station itself was also completely devoid of people, not even a clerk in sight. I’d already paid for my gas and decided against getting myself a drink before heading back. 

 

That night, I didn’t nearly drift off to sleep as quickly as the first, the warning kept ringing in my head, despite the storm raging outside, and the monotonous drone of the fan, I’d tossed and turned until almost 2 in the morning, at which I was awoken with a start by a scratching at the door. I was up, and looking through the peephole, revolver in hand before I’d realized the gravity of the situation and the warning that she’d given me. Because on the other side of that door was the receptionist, eyes wider than I’d ever seen, her black T-shirt and jeans scarcely shielding her against the cold, she looked so, so frail, standing out there in the wind and snow. That night, I’d scarcely slept a wink, the image of her burned into my head, but there was a curious itch that had developed on my right arm.  

 

I walked into the lobby, the unmistakable aroma of her flipping sausages on an iron skillet wafted through the air. She offered me some, no doubt concerned about the bags under my eyes. I was in no mood to continue the drive and nursing an absolutely horrendous headache. The weather had conceded that to me, as two feet of thick snow had fallen over the course of the night, almost burying my little car from view. I’d asked about the cost of an extension, but she said that it’d be on the house, with a lil twinkle in her eye, and I asked what I could do to make it up to her, and we spent the next few hours cleaning and talking, mostly talking. I’d recognized a few more songs playing in the background, and we’d talked about the concerts we’d been to. Apparently, she’d wanted to drive across the country to attend one, but her friend had ditched her at the very last minute, and so she made the drive herself, all 16 hours. I suppose she wasn’t that insane, as I was making a similar drive myself.  

 

It was harder and harder to hide what the itch was slowly becoming, as little clay flowers had started to sprout through my skin. The long coat I wore covered it, but I’d almost immediately thrown it off when I’d gotten back to my room, the fabric brushing up against the sore and tender buds almost bringing me to tears. By the time the sun had set, my whole forearm was almost covered with growths, little clay flowers. I’d run them under the cold water from the sink for a while, but even then, that wasn’t enough, it wasn’t nearly enough. It was when I was shaving in the mirror that I’d accidentally nicked my arm against the wall, and the immense pain had sent me instantly to the floor.  

 

I’d sat curled up in the corner for a while before I stood and staggered myself into the shower with my clothes on. The warm water was a well-deserved relief from the agonizing pain of the flowers, almost numbing my arm to the sensation of something alien growing, and in that moment, I knew exactly what I needed to do.  

 

The pain from the steam radiator was almost indescribable, an electric shock going through the pit of my stomach would’ve come close, but as I held my arm there, biting a soaked towel through to muffle my screams, the flowers fell off one by one, charring as they hit the ground.    

 

I don’t remember when I’d fallen asleep that day, only that I’d woken in a lump of sweat and tears in the corner of the room. I’d quickly showered and dressed the burns on my right hand with what little gauze I had left and went out to meet her. She seemed a little worse for wear, but she still smiled at me as I walked in, the pain in my arm almost disappearing as she did. We’d talked a little bit about the future over breakfast, what we wanted to do, where we wanted to go, I think I’d mentioned something about wanting to tour the grand canyons, and she’d talked about wanting to visit her home country again at some point. She asked if I wanted to see the art she’d been making, and I obliged. She led me to the back, a little closet that she’d reserved exclusively for art materials and art she’d said. I guess it was no surprise that she’d had so many ways to keep busy. It was beautiful, bright and vibrant, almost abstract in a sense, characters without eyes, their brains becoming flowers and mold, chains and smoke.  I felt the raw pain and passion emanating from them, as if I’d been brought into that little corner of her world, what she’d only shown me, and nobody else. 

 

That night was even worse than the last, the clay flowers had completely overtaken both of my arms at this point, and this time they didn’t come off nearly as cleanly as the first time, and I’d taken a knife to the edge and slowly cut through them, searing the open wound on the metal as I did. I wondered if she heard me scream, as she was standing right outside my door, and once again I looked, as I knew that that was the only thing I could do, to see her glowing again.  

 

That night, the dreams returned, and in it I was a tree. I was alone, growing in the darkness, and then I was two, something else, another face sprouted, and I didn’t recognize it, and I screamed in pain, falling out of my bed and crashing unceremoniously through the nightstand beside me.  

 

The next morning, her hair was a little less rough and frayed, the bags under her eyes had faded a little, and I was all the more relieved about it. The snow still stayed, and we talked for hours, and I would’ve been fine if that was how it was. I’d been in and out of consciousness intermittently throughout the day, and when I awoke, the midday sun shining in my face, she’d moved to the gallery in the rear of the lobby, at least that’s where I found her. She’d been working for quite a while now, a new, unfinished painting, rough sketch lines and light, delicate brush strokes. Like everything she’d done before, it was beautiful, but not quite in the vein of everything else, as this was a landscape painting. Two figures stood before the vastness of a lake, and I stood and watched as she slowly worked, it was almost hypnotic in a way.   

 

It all changed the next night, as I sat next to the radiator, slowly contemplating what I had to do, I noticed a shadowy figure, looming in the corner, and I knew for certain that I dare not look at it, I dare not acknowledge it, not even as it pushed its fingers into the bulbs in my hands, as I curled myself up into a ball.   The next night, I awoke with a start, seeing that she wasn’t in front of the motel peephole for once, I took the liberty of taking a short walk in the cold, to be free from that musty, stale, almost chokingly humid room. The figure was gone, and the flowers had subsided for now, and for that one singular moment, I felt as though I was the freest man in the entire world.  

 

I returned from my walk, legs pushing through the knee deep snow, and I chanced a glance at the rest of the rooms, none of their lights were on, but as I scanned, I’d realized that there was a singular room with its door ever so slightly propped, open, the one next to mine. I walked over and slowly tried the knob, it was unlocked, and as I slowly pushed through, it hit me like a truck. The overpowering scent of flowers, an almost sickly-sweet smell. I fished my flashlight out and panned it around the open doorway, not wanting to step foot beyond the threshold of the door.  

 

A body lay against the furthest wall, its shape sunken, almost deeper than the wall itself, clay flowers erupting from every orifice, bursting through every pore in his skin. Was it even an it, no I knew this person, his beige blazer and pink dress shirt, the very same pink dress shirt that I was wearing. I blinked, and it was just a room, no smell, no him, nothing, just an ordinary motel room. I looked at the clock, and it read August the 8th, and I knew that I could stay no longer.  

 

The 2 cans of gasoline in my car were like lead weights on my arms, they screamed in protest, the days of searing and cutting had rubbed them raw. And as I tightened my grip on the cans, they almost seemed to prick my hand with needle-like fire. It's fine, I thought, this had to be done, the manager’s office was dark at this time of the day, I knew I had to act fast.  

 

The liquid flowed as if it had no end, pouring out of the cans, their shimmering hue against the golden light of the porch lights, my golden salvation, and finally when the entirety of the outside of the motel had been drenched in gasoline, I sparked my cigarette lighter, once, twice and the flame came alive, and so too did the motel, a roaring inferno, at once almost blinding, yet of an indescribable warmth. I hoped she was at least asleep. I didn’t want to think about it.  

 

The inferno blinded me through my rear-view mirror as though the midday sun, as I put my foot to the floor, and prayed and begged the old engine, as it rattled and creaked, pulling as hard as it possibly could as I merged onto the highway. There was nobody else, why would there be, she’d always said that there was never anybody else.  

 

Nobody who’d stay.  

 

And I felt tears stream down my eyes. She’d always said that nobody ever stayed, and I had proven her right, I hadn’t stayed, I couldn’t stay. The car was so cold now that I almost couldn’t feel the burns on my palms as I gripped the wheel.  

 

It had been hours, at least that’s what it felt like. I’d lost count, but when I still was, it’d almost been four. The shroud of darkness was still draped over the landscape. I was alone with just the road and my high beams, on and on and on. And then, there it was, plain as day, Motel Evergreen. It would’ve taken me by surprise if I hadn’t already anticipated it, stomach churning, as I pulled off the freeway.  

 

It took me by even more of a surprise to see it completely fine, no sign that an act of arson had even been committed. Little lights hung from the front of the lobby and along the railings in front of every room. She must’ve been in a festive mood, I thought as I pulled up in front of the lobby. I sat in my car for a bit, unable to reconcile the two realities. I had set the motel ablaze no more than a few hours ago, had I not, and yet, here it was, completely fine. A knock on the car door forced me out of my train of thought as I looked over to see her, dressed in a beautiful red dress. Granted, it wasn’t what I would’ve expected out of her, but she was never really one for fashion, and her attempt was almost blinding in and of itself.  

 

I let her in and asked if she knew the way. “Yeah, I know a place,” she smiled, her eyes twinkling. The drive wasn’t long, and we talked the whole way, just the little things, about how her mom had bought her this dress, and the attempts she’d made at eyeliner, and how she’d failed almost consistently. I laughed and told her that I liked it even if she thought it was botched. We talked about how I needed to go somewhere for a while, maybe a long while, and she said she’d miss me.   It wasn’t long before we arrived, a pristine field, green grass and bleachers, with slow jazz rolling in the background and the words “PROM” unevenly emblazoned on a massive banner at the entrance. “Quaint, isn’t it. I thought you might like it.”  

 

"Oh, it's great, it's like we’re high schoolers again” I laughed, the air hot and heavy, as if lingering in place, lingering in the moment. We had awful watered down punch, and we sat, just talking about everything under the sun, I’d always loved the way that she’d talked about the things she was passionate about with such fervent vigor, and I could’ve sat and watched for hours, if not for the silhouette of a woman in the far corner of the field, watching us the whole time.   “Look at me.” She whispered, sensing my anxiety, and she took my hand, to my surprise, and pulled me up, and we walked over to the center of the field.  

 

“I don’t really know how to dance,” I started, but she shushed me.  

 

“I don’t really either.” 

 

“You took Chinese dance.” 

 

“Doesn’t mean I was any good at it.”    

I smirked and twirled her around, and she stumbled a little.   “I don’t wear flats often.” she said sheepishly,   “Well that makes us evenly matched then”, as I undid my blazer, letting the breeze flow past me as we danced together, a little awkwardly, but together, nonetheless.   I wanted to stay in that moment, to linger there forever.  

 

The drive back to the motel was silent, she sat, watching the streetlights go by, never even chancing a glance at me the whole time. And as I pulled into the motel, I slowed the car to a stop and looked over at her, her wavy black hair silhouetted in the darkness of the car, I smiled a little to myself.  

 

“I hope you had fun,I know it wasn’t really the best” I started.  

 

“No, it was fantastic,” a little smile spread across her face, even in the dim interior lights, I could still see the dimples in her cheek.  

 

“Let me get the door,” I said, exiting the car, and I could see her giggle a little through the foggy glass as I walked over and helped her out. We walked, side by side, I reached out and took her hand again, and she recoiled slightly, but held on.  

 

“Just this once, just a little longer” I said, a little more forcefully than I had intended. The wind picked up and I felt the biting air crawl and slither its way down my back, and I shuddered slightly.  

 

We walked together in silence, echoing footfalls against the concrete, and I glanced over, the unbroken clear blue water of the lake a mesmerizing trance. It’d been a while since I’d been back here. 

 

“I really enjoyed what we had, you know,” she said, her words pulling me back into the moment, her eyes still not meeting mine.   

 

“I did too, but I can’t really do this anymore”, I let the line fall heavily from my lips. “It’s been exhausting, and I’ve kinda been bending over backwards, y’know?”  

 

“I think you saw only what you wanted to see, the part of me that you wanted to believe in” 

her words cut deep, I felt her holding onto my pinky, and then slowly her fingers slipped off.  

 

“Did you really know me?” She asked, a little more accusatory this time, and then I realized the wind had picked up, cold and biting, her hoodie fluttered in the wind, her back to me, I shivered, my t shirt and shorts no barrier against the encircling cold that threatened to choke the words back down my throat, but I forced them out regardless  

 

“I suppose I never really did.” 

 

And in that moment, the distance between us felt colder than the swirling wind, colder than even the darkest, most desolate of nights. I opened my mouth, barely a whisper, I knew she wasn’t looking but I wanted her to ask, I wanted her to at least pretend to care, to try to know how cold I felt in that moment. Maybe she felt cold too, she’d always gotten cold easily, and I just wanted to know.  

 

I awoke in a daze, my car was most definitely snowed in again, and my back ached as if I was forty. I rolled around trying to remember why I was even there before realizing that I had taken a quick detour to get groceries and some supplies. As I exited the convenience store, I realized how alone I was, my only company, a red Subaru sitting at the corner of the lot near an instrument store, which of course, was closed this time of the year. I had stared into its vacant shelves for what seemed like forever, a twinge of familiarity in its arrangement.  

 

And it was that night that I had a dream, I was in that very same instrument store, except that the lights were on, and I needed to go somewhere, and there she was, her black t-shirt and jeans, far too light for the raging snowstorm outside, and no matter how I tried, I couldn’t reach her, I was always a step behind, always at a distance.  

 

I woke to the sun in my face, the snow had almost melted overnight, the parking lot slick with ice. I glanced around and realized this time, I was actually completely alone, sitting on a slab of concrete in the middle of nowhere. The Subaru had left in the night too, probably for good this time, I thought.  

 

The little Honda turned over a few times, sputtering and churning before it finally started and I was bombarded with calls from my friend as he asked where I was, apparently, I was a few days late to our meeting. It was then that I realized that I hadn’t had cell reception for the longest time. Part of me wondered if it was the work of the motel, but then again, I didn’t have much of an answer to anything. I eventually made it up to him, but I never really told him the full story, only that I was snowed in at a motel for a couple of days, and he never asked.   

 

It was just a few months ago that I encountered it again, this time, on a long drive back down to Florida to visit my parents. The warm, almost stale summer air pushed past my face as I cruised down I-75, and there it was, almost unassuming in its appearance, but it was a sign I knew all too well. “Next Exit for Motel Evergreen”. I felt a knot grow in my stomach, as the sweat dripped down my hands, making the wheel shimmer in the summer sun, the sweat despite the cold. I felt it then, a rush of stinging cold air, as I turned into the off ramp.  

 

I pulled into the lot, stepping outside I felt a slow chill that pushed past my skin, it should’ve been summer yet in the midday sun my knees ached and creaked. Her red corolla was where she’d always left it, parked near the manager’s office. Specks of rust had emerged from under the dulling red paint, dancing across the usually pristine sidewalls of the car. The tires were no worse for wear, lumpy and deflated. I thought of asking if she needed some help with them and then realizing that I didn’t quite know where she would be.  

 

The Motel wasn’t quite as I had left it, it held scarcely any sign of arson, no burn marks, no charring, nothing. The windows, always immaculately maintained, were grimy, filled with cobwebs. I ran my finger down the outside of one, watching my finger make a clean line through the grey, exposing the darkness inside. There was faint music, a crackling speaker by the front desk. I knew it was hers long before I rounded the receptionist counter. The little picture of a terrier sat framed on the counter, its countenance covered by a layer of dust.  

 

She’d always talked about wanting to be a vet, I wondered about the little dog, she was old when we’d talked. Was she still around, probably not? I wondered how she’d react if she knew. I flicked the switch back and forth for a moment, no power. I wonder how she’d always kept this place immaculate; it must’ve been a lot of work for a single person. That single person who simply wasn’t here anymore. I dusted the couch and sat down for a bit, a little respite from the heat, I thought. The heat. The heat was back, and I sat, perhaps for minutes, perhaps for hours, letting it soak into me, like a slow ripple, fanning out till it covered everything.   

 

And when I closed the office door for the last time, I looked back at the old decrepit once was, and then never again. The Audi roared to life as I swung it round in the gravel and punched it off the lot. But somewhere in me knew that no matter how fast I ran, I’d never escape it. It would always be waiting, no matter where I went, what route I took, and someday I’d look over and see that looming sign in the distance. When I thought back on it, I’d wanted her to ask me in that moment, in the lingering cold, as I stood and watched her walk into the distance, for her to ask me if I felt cold too. Maybe that’s why it’ll always find me.
