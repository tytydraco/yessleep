She moved in only a month ago. Back then I remember being happy to be rid of Rodney the Ripper after more than 20 years.

Rodney and I shared a bedroom wall in Brooklyn and even with prewar wall thickness, no cap, that motherfucker could saw wood until the walls shook like a leaf on a tree.

Little did I know when I shook Rodney's hand, and told him I hoped things worked out with his mentally ill sister, Vera, he was moving out west to take care of, my real problems hadn't even begun.

The next week there was a non-stop racket as my landlord's workers dealt with the detritus of Rodney's wake. Place looked like it hadn't any love or cleaning products since the last century. 

And then, one morning, as I was sipping a quad soy Venti, rationalized by yours truly, saying to myself, no caffeine no peace, she moved in.

She was Barbara. Barbara Sitwick to be exact. She rang my bell bold as an FSB hit, shoving a fruitcake in my hands.

"You can call me Babs. Everybody tells me I talk a lot so if I talk aboot shit too much, just tell me neighbor."

She was a short, fat thing. Maybe in her late 30s, early 40s. It was hard to tell with the bags under her eyes and the thin network of blood vessels in her bird like nose.

"Is that an accent, you sp-"

"Canada! I am Canadian and-"

"French Canada or Neil Young Cana-"

That was a big mistake. 

"NEIL YOUNG?!!!!? I was just listening to-.... Nwil Young is aboot my favorite-.... KISMET-"

It went on another mile a minute then she somehow was inside.  Somehow she took one look at my sty and next minute coffee was on the way.

"What a dump! Needs a woman's touch. Got anything to drink, Sailor boy?"

I found a half-full bottle of The Balvenie in my cabinet over the sink.

She took one look at the bottle then snatched it away before I could say anything. 

She pulled the cork, wiped the neck and mouth of the bottle with her sleeve in what looked like a practiced flourish,  then proceeded to chug the whole fucker.

"I took everything from that motherfucker in the divorce. I can buy and sell your kidneys, big boy."

She burped and the buzzer rang. Now she was taking deliveries?! Ralph didn't even bark like usual. 

She drunk walked back to the kitchenette with the bag of Joe. She smelled like scotch and trouble. 

Kinda made Starbucks pointless but we drank our coffee and the next thing I knew she had my golden retriever guard dog, Ralph hiding in the tub. That was only reserved hitherto for thunderstorms. 

Then she looked around. 

"If we break down a wall this place would get sun all day. And you could bake my bread. Because,  

I might want you to do things that even a goon would think twice aboot."

I don't know how, but I came home last week and Ralph didn't run to the door to greet me like it had been years, like usual. Instead, I found him crying in the tub. He had pissed the fur on his golden chest.

By the time I got Ralph cleaned up, then the bathroom,  something felt amiss. 

And then,  then I spied it. The empty whisky bottle. The divorce decree.  The blueprint of our conjoined apartments. And most inexplicably,  a giant piece of Bab's hair. And a rag that looked bloody. 

There was a handwritten letter under the bottle that said.

I'm your new bestie, not Ralphie boy. We can discuss later. Good couples have regular check-ins.

Babs

I asked Ralph if he had any ideas what the fuck I should do. He did not.
