Greetings to you all. My name is Sven. I just really need to speak to someone, to let it out and perhaps ease my conscience before it is too late. I have made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I work as a security guard officer in a small port in Europe, and I have been in the job for almost a decade now without any major incident. I did not know that it would change nine days ago in one of the worst manners. 

That night, at around 7 am during my last patrol, I heard faint tapping sounds coming from the container yard. I paid attention, while walking in the yard, shining my flashlight on containers as a reaction to the tapping that grew louder as I approached the impending doom. 

Under six minutes, I finally located the container and could clearly hear someone tapping from inside it. Those containers were emptied earlier in the day, I remembered, baffled by the fact that someone instead of at least something, had been mistakenly forgotten inside. 

The moment I tapped on the container to make my presence known, the person trapped in the storage box also tapped from inside it, on the same spot and at the same time, almost as if that person knew what I would do. 

"Who's there? Who's inside?" I asked, certain that it could just be a stevedore trapped inside following a mistake or even a prank, and I wanted to play a little bit with the person. I was answered with silence.
 
With my radio, I contacted my colleague Lana to explain the situation to her and we even laughed a little bit about that, persuaded that it was either a mistake or a prank. However, the seriousness of the situation resurfaced when I gave the container number to Lana and, she could not find it in any record whatsoever.

"Please, please, help me. Open the door." I heard a faint male voice coming from inside. For a few seconds, I was frozen in place, shocked and unable to answer because, he really sounded like me.

"Sir? You alright?" I asked, after regaining my composure. 

"I am not alright. Please help me. Open the door." The man answered. 

"How did you end up in there?" I asked with a smile, still willing to joke with him about it before I help him.

"Please help me. Open the door." He pleaded again, with the same tone, like some kind of recording prepared for the situation. 

"Really? It was true? I thought you were pulling a prank." Goran, another security officer, said while arriving on the scene. 

"Please, help me. Open the door." The man said. 

"What? Kinda sounds like you bro." Goran noticed. "Who's that?" He added. 

"That is me." The man spoke. 

"You hurt?" I asked, thinking that it was enough and we had to let him out. 

"I am hurt, I am bleeding, I am feeling cold, please help me. Open the door." The man said. 

I approached, ready to help, but Goran stopped me on my track, squinting his eyes as if he just noticed something wrong. I could agree that someone speaking like that, and using full words instead of contractions seemed strange. However, that man could just be disoriented and especially needed help. 

"How did you end up in there?" Goran questioned. Once again, no answer. "Who are you?" He added. 

"I am me." The man spoke. 

"You who? What's your name?" Goran asked. No answer. 

"You work here?" I asked. 

"No. The sun will soon rise. Please help me. Open the door." 

"The sun? How do you know that?" Goran asked, but the man stayed silent. 

"Maybe he got a watch." I suggested. 

"It's all dark in there." Goran pointed out. 

"An electronic one?" I again suggested, trying to help the man's case. "How many are you in there?" I added. 

"Me." The man spoke. 

"Where you coming from?" Goran randomly asked. 

"From far away. The sun will soon rise. Please let me out, please help me. Open the door." The man said.

"Where exactly?" I questioned. 

"Where there is no sun. Please, the sun will soon rise. Please help me. Open the door." The man answered.

After a lot of arguing with Goran, and pleading from the man, other security guards and other colleagues from different departments also arrived on the scene, prompting the reluctant Goran to finally succumb to pressure and let me open the door to rescue the man.

I began the process to open the storage steel box, while Goran and the others stood behind me, guns and flashlights ready, to prevent any kind of foul play. I pulled the right side open and expected the man to appear but he did not move. I pulled the left side open, and unveiled the horror that awaited for us.

There was nobody and nothing in the container, except for a wooden mannequin covered with strange symbols carved on it. That thing had clearly its place in a mystic temple or a shrine instead of a steel box. The walls of the container were also covered with bizarre drawings and symbols. 

"I told you not to open that door." A now trembling Goran spoke.

At that instant, the mannequin tilted its head to the left, making cracking sounds and a smile mysteriously carved itself on its face, before the mannequin turned into dust, from its head to its feet, and the dust escaped from the container. 

We looked at the whole phenomenon, frightened, paralyzed, powerless and also mentally broken at the realization that we might have released a calamity into the city and the world, something we do not even know the nature or the capacity of.

The day after, Goran was found mysteriously dead in his living room. No wound, no fight, no sickness, no nothing. He was just dead, an expression of pure fright stuck on his face. That entity, in addition to being terrifying, was also vengeful. 

Since, I have been checking the news relentlessly, for I am sure to bear a part of responsibility for any tragedy that thing may cause, be it accident, disease or even death. That thing will come for us, but if that container was meant to imprison it, then it was certainly dangerous for the whole world too.

Therefore, whatever happens to you, please, accept these sincere apologies for our mistake. I am really sorry.
