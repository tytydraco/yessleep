Hey guys, check out these entries from a bloody note book I found in the attic. I was told it was found amongst a house that was destroyed by a combination of a bear and water damage to the basement which caused the place to collapse. There was a ton of blood everywhere in the basement and on the entrance of the basement, but no signs of any bodies or survivors, only ten .30 cal casings and a bunch of illegal explosive ammo. We haven't opened it because no one wanted to touch the blood, but no one had the heart to throw it away. I don't see the problem with blood, just wash your hands afterward, haha! The notebook reads as follows below,

August 12, 1953
My name is Jim Underground, and I am no stranger to violence or gore. If you find this, I am confessing to the following:

In 1938 I lured a 38 yearold drunken man away from a party to my place, 97 miles deep in the northern Canadian woods. Upon us getting home I proceeded to beat him to a bloody pulp and nailed up on my living room wall using 5 nails between and on either side of the fingers of each hand, as well as a nail through each palm and wrist joint. From there I used him to hone my dart-throwing skills for 9 days before he died. After his death I buried him 12 feet deep in the woods 1 mile from my house.

In 1947 I grabbed a 22 year old man from his home by beating him in fist-a-cuffs and then drugging him for the 210 mile drive. I chained him to the basement floor, placed a box with a hole cut for his foot over his ankle, used caulk to seal his foot inside the open-top box, and repeated for his other foot. I then poured 200lbs of concrete into each box and force fed my victim for the 8 months he lived. During these 8 months I used him in conjunction with a medical book to learn a great deal about how the human body distributes blood through the body, as well as how well attached some bones and joints are than others. This now 23 year old died of a blood infection I probably gave him during one of my exploratory surgeries. I buried him not too far from my other victim. Both in unmarked graves, both 12 feet under clay rich soil, both 1 mile from where I live.


Over the years, starting in 1949 I have been practicing my aim. There is a road not too far from my house, the only one around here. If I hear someone go down it, they HAVE to come back up it. And when they do, I’m waiting with my faithful M1 Garand. I kill everyone inside, and wire the vehicle to drive full-throttle into the nearby lake. I leave the bodies about 20 feet off the road, they always disappear within 24 hours with barely a trace. I have killed not less than 20 people this way.


Out here, I hunt a lot of bears. ‘Even shot one in my house before! Today, I fear for my safety, for today I could have sworn I heard someone yell “please, HELP US!” From a few miles up the road of my hunting spot (about 15 miles from home). They sounded distressed, like a monster was killing them. I drove up the road to see what happened, I saw 12 tents, 2 cars, and a fire that was still burning. The tents were slashed up and splattered with blood, I saw no trace of anyone still being around. By a car, I saw a massive dent on the roof on the passenger side, 4 MASSIVE claw marks had ripped the metal without a problem. There were 10 casings of what I can only assume to be 9 mill bullets, based off the 9 mill on the ground not too far away. What ever did that, probably ate atleast 5 rounds of 9 mill… and left NO sign of having been hit. Weird.



September 5, 1953

I was taking my 3rd victim of torture, a 22 year old woman, out to my grave sites. What I found, was 2 MASSIVE holes. The soil was ripped up by something very powerful with massive claws. The bodies that use to be buried there… were gone. I saw a trail going deeper into the woods, I dropped the woman’s body and ran here to write on the matter and grab my gun. Hopefully I can find where this thing lives and kill it in it’s sleep before it does the same to me.



September 5, 1953.

Help me.
I followed the trail about 1.5 miles, and came to a large hole in the side of a hill. The hole looked like it was dug by human hands, had the remains of atleast 40 humans around it, dozenes of dozens of bear and moose skulls, and a huge white humanoid who was atleast 9 feet tall on all 4s. The instant I saw him, he slowly turned his head and looked my in the eye. One of his eyes was full of sorrow and despair, the other full of anger and lust. He began to turn his whole body, but when I shouldered my M1 he froze. Good I thought, he’s afraid of my rifle. His mouth had been drawn out like more of that of a horse or alligator, but yet it still began to smile. It spoke in a guttural voice “do not fear me, for I would be stupid to eat he who so graciously feeds me.” Then he let off a horrible un-natural noise like that of a laugh but also a siren or horn. And walked into the woods, away from me. He walked on 2 hind legs… standing not less than 17 feet tall. In just a few seconds he perfectly disappeared into the woods. Afraid, I ran back home.



September 10, 1953

The creature I have called Larry whispered through my window tonight, telling me to feed him in 5 days time… or else. I have to comply.



January 1, 1954
Larry has been asking for food every 10 days, each time with a 5 day window. Today, he asked for food just 3 days ago. And once again, if I don’t feed him by January 6th: he’s promised to eat me.

January 17, 1954

Larry sometimes asks for food multiple times a week now, I’ve stock-piled the locals from a village 115 miles away in my basement. All 28 of them are chained up down there… I shudder to think of how long they won’t last me. I’ve watched Larry eat, he seams to grow a little larger with each human I feed him. As in, with every bite of flesh he instantly gets a little bigger. How… terrifyingly interesting.

Febuary 23, 1954

I have 31 people chained in my basement. Larry has revealed a terrifying fact. Last night he told me “I’ve eaten every last living thing within 20 miles of here, all that remain are some elusive birds, and you. There may be some fish I missed, but I felt like swimming and caught a few thousand.” There are 8 inches of ice on the lakes. He also said he now requires daily feeding due to a lack of local prey. I’ve heavily considered moving, after all: I have to drive nearly 100 miles just to get to the next closest person’s house. Only problem with that, Larry follows my car every where I go and eats everything nearby that isn’t being observed by a human. I can never truly escape. 7 days ago I arranged to buy a pack of high explosive ammo for my M1, as well as a new gun: the M6, chambered in 30 caliber. I tested some of it today, it’s good stuff.



April 7 7am

Ok, I have a crazy idea. Tell Larry to eat his fill of my basement and just leave me alone. What I’m hoping will happen is he will get stuck and I can kill him.

9am, good bye world, Larry is eating his lill d0wnlherø, hesalreadv too big to escapebasement. I have to do it, now or never,

The notebook ends with Jim signing his name. I find it strange the authorities didn’t take this as evidence when they investigated the house. I have to convert hand writing into text so, sorry for the weird capitalization and strange characters. You know, I also live in the woods, I live about 20 minutes away from any real town, but just 45 seconds away from a grave yard. Hmm. Weird coincidence. Anyway, I researched the topic a little bit after reading this entry, apparently in 1957 there was a report of a 35 foot tall white humanoid in northern Canada, maybe this is the creature from when it was younger?
