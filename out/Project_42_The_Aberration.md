“We keep it at the end of the hall,” Dr. Driver tells me. She’s pushing a flatbed with screaming wheels down an empty corridor. “Its official designation is Project 42, but we mostly stick to calling it the Aberration.”

“What are we bringing?” I ask, eyeing the box on the flatbed. 

Her eyes flick down. They pass over the cargo and then back to me. “It’ll be easier if you see for yourself.”

"Now?"

"No," she says.

“When?”

“When the time comes.”

I set my jaw. We keep walking down a hallway that never ends. We go on like that for an hour until my legs are sore and my feet are numb. It doesn’t make sense. Why keep a weapon so far from the lab? 

“I’m guessing this is a bioweapon?" I say. "Some kind of highly infectious virus?”

Dr. Driver’s mouth twitches. There’s something there, some faint reaction that borders on terror and amusement, but her poker face prevails. “Something like that.”

I smile. I get it now. It’s my first day at the lab, and she’s having some fun stringing me along. I’ve been in her position before, acting as the senior research lead on projects that people would- and have - killed to learn about. 

No matter. I can play the game. 

We keep walking. Lights hum above us, flickering to life as we pass beneath them before dying as we leave their halo. They’re attached to motion sensors. Behind us is darkness. Everything ahead is darkness. I’m walking blind toward a weapon I don’t understand, with a woman I’ve never met, carrying cargo I’ve never seen. 

Everything's fine. 

“It’s just up ahead,” Dr. Driver says, bringing the flatbed to a whining stop. For a second, I think I hear the cargo shift, think I hear it make a noise. “The Aberration isn’t something to take lightly," she continues, "so there are some ground rules I need you to follow while you’re in its vicinity.”

“Sure,” I say, watching her march into the darkness. Just beyond the island of light is a hazy wall of grey steel. A door. Something massive. It’s pockmarked with age and wear, and all along its surface are thick gashes an inch or deeper. Running along the side of the door are locks. Mechanisms to keep something inside from getting outside. 

“What’s the deal with the rust?” I ask, gesturing to the red smudges across the steel. “Maintenance staff on holiday?”

Dr. Driver pauses. She runs a finger along the door, gathers a trail of red-brown on her fingertip and then brings it to her nose. Smells it. “This isn’t rust,” she says, grimacing. “It’s blood.”

My heart skips a beat. It happens for a second, and only a second, before I crack a smile. I’ve done my fair share of hazing, but this is good. Better than most. “Blood?” I laugh. “Whose?”

“Your predecessor’s, most likely." 

I grin. The way she says it with that hint of mournful regret is almost film-worthy. She’s selling this act. The least I can do is play along. “Oh,” I reply, voice shaking. “That’s t-terrible.”

“It is,” Dr. Driver replies, fishing in her lab coat. She pulls out a black mask. Hands it to me. “Here, you’ll need this when you go inside.”

I take it from her. It’s heavy. The fabric is thick with a weave resembling Kevlar, and the mask is the full-face type. Like a balaclava. Over the eye slots are two orange lenses. “Why a mask?” I ask. 

“For safety. Why else?”

She drifts away. She drifts into the shadows near the door, the white of her lab coat dim enough she could be a ghost. Her fingers work on the locking mechanisms running along the side of the door. I hear the gentle click of springs releasing. The hiss of pressurized air being exhaled. 

“Put the mask on,” she tells me. “I’m almost finished here.”

I slip it over my head. The fabric is musky inside, smells like sweat, like decay and maybe even a bit of blood. I wrinkle my nose. This thing hasn’t been washed in weeks, but judging by the rest of this facility, it’s hardly a surprise.  “You mentioned ground rules inside the weapon chamber,” I tell her. “Care to fill me in?”

“Certainly.” She pauses, points to the flatbed beside me. “First of all, grab that and bring it over.”

I grip the handlebar, push it into the dark next to her. “Done. What now?”

Another lock. Then another. “When I open this,” she says, “you’re going to keep your eyes glued to the floor. Look nowhere else. If you hear anything, ignore it. Walk the flatbed exactly ten paces into the room and wait for my signal. Walk any further, and you’re dead.”

My stomach twists. I wonder if this is another bit of ritual hazing, but I decide it’s better to assume everything is real from this point forward. Better safe than sorry. “Okay,” I tell her. “What’s the signal?”

She gives two sharp raps on the door with a pocket wrench. “When you hear that, you’re going to scream and leave the flatbed, running back to me. It’s important that you run toward the direction of the banging, and not where you think you came from. Got it?”

Strange. But okay. 

“When you reach the door, I need you to get small. Curl into a ball if you can. Whatever you do, don’t stay on your feet, and for the love of God, keep your eyes closed. If the Aberration approaches you, don’t engage. Clear?”

I shake my head. “Hang on, if it approaches me? I though this was a bioweapon. You're talking about it like it's a person."

“It's not,” she says darkly. “Not anymore.” There’s a hiss and creak as she unlatches the final lock. Grunting, she heaves on the door handle. The heavy steel groans, echoing through the long hallway as it grinds against the uneven concrete floor. “Hurry. Get inside.”

Swallowing my unease, I push the flatbed halfway across the threshold before pausing. “Wait. You’re not coming with me?”

“Somebody has to let you out after, don’t they?”

Fuck me. 

Fine. I don’t bother arguing the point, pushing the cart the rest of the way into the room. Behind me, I hear the whine of hinges, the scrape of the door, and finally the deafening crash of it closing. In the room, darkness is absolute. I can’t even see my feet. 

“Ten paces,” I mutter, knees trembling. Okay. I can do this.

I start marching. One step. Two. It feels like I’m walking into an abyss, like I’m being swallowed by a whale, eaten by an empty universe. Five. Six. Somewhere in the infinite blackness I hear movement. Shuffling. There’s a rustle of clothing, a slap of feet upon cold concrete. Ignore it. Eight. Nine. 

At ten paces I stop. The flatbed’s wheel screech, announcing my arrival with all the grace of a bleeding gazelle. My fingers drum against the handlebar. Signal? Where was it? Any minute now… 

A sound.

It’s nearby. A creak, a faint whimper of wheel bearings. The flatbed is moving. Is the ground uneven? I hold the bar tighter, worried it might roll away from me, and I feel the subtle shock-wave of vibrations ripple through my fingers.

The cargo. The box.

There’s a voice coming from it, strangled and quiet, like it’s been smothered with duct tape. My heart slams. Is there a fucking person in there? Struggling? Is this part of the hazing?

**BANG BANG**

Christ. The signal. My fingers linger on the handlebar, my conscience fighting my common sense as I wonder if I can really walk away from this person. More importantly– what if this is part of a test? Did they want to see if I’d let a coworker die?

What kind of fucking joke was this?

More muffled groans. No, they sound like moans– almost orgasmic. Like something inside is writhing in sexual ecstasy. What the hell?

**BANG BANG BANG**

Screw it. I abandon the cart, dashing toward Dr. Driver’s signal. My hands find cool steel, and I drop onto my ass, back flush against the door, eyes clenched shut. I’m not yet willing to debase myself by curling into a ball. For all I know, she’s got night vision cameras wired and I’m about to be the laughing stock of the lunchroom come curtain call. 

Breathing.

I hear breathing in the dark.

It’s paired with footsteps, heavy, slapping footsteps like bare skin on concrete. They're getting closer. I think they pause near the flat bed, think they start sniffing. Then I hear the crunch of wood. I hear the squeal of those shitty wheels, and a rip of something that sounds like duct tape.

“Oh, my savior. It’s you. It’s truly you–”

The words become a slurring groan. They drift on, lost in a cacophony of wet ripping, like skin being split open, like bones being cracked apart. I hear something slurp. I hear the sounds of a man gasping, wheezing as something makes his lungs its plaything. 

Splat.

Splat.

I don’t even realize I’ve done it, but I’ve shrank into a ball. A trembling, shaking ball on the dirty floor and I’m wondering how this can all be a prank. A hazing ritual. It’s too sophisticated. I grew up the son of a butcher, and I know the sound of raw meat striking the floor, and I know that’s what I’m listening to. Things falling out of a person. Intestines, maybe. 

Splat.

Splat.

Then, silence. 

There’s nothing left to hear, nothing left to listen to but the *thump thump* of my pounding heart. Damp. It’s damp between my legs, and I can’t even smell the piss because my nostrils are full with the scent of blood.

*Oh god,* I think. 

*Oh god, oh fuck, where did it go?*

It answers. A voice in the dark, slathered in genocide and agony. It slithers into my ear like a millipede, chews through my skull and into my mind. I feel its feet. They’re running inside of me, skittering across my thoughts like tiny razors cutting my consciousness into ribbons. 

“You never screamed,” it says. 

My stomach twists into a knot. It’s right. Dr. Driver told me to scream when I heard her signal, and I completely forgot because it was absolutely *insane* and didn’t even approach the realm of making sense. “No but…” I start to speak, and like a knife in my spleen I’m reminded of another no no– don’t engage with the Aberration. Whatever you do, *don’t engage.*

I clamp my mouth shut. I keep my eyes closed. I lay there whimpering like a caught rabbit, praying this monster, this so-called weapon, isn't in the mood for seconds. 

“Do you know why she asks them to scream?” the voice says, casually. “It’s because it triggers my prey instinct. When I hear the sound of screams, I can’t help but sink my teeth in.”

I swallow. My face is wet beneath the mask, soaked through with tears. In the dark, I hear that thing start moving, hear its footsteps smacking the concrete. I hear it coming for me. The Aberration. 

“She sent you here to die, you know.”

Closer.

“She sends them all to die.”

I shrink, praying if I can just make myself small enough it’ll leave me alone. 

“It’s the way she’s always been,” the Aberration rasps, its voice next to me now. “My evil bitch of a mother.”

Mother? Did I hear that right?

Pressure on my mask. A finger, I think. Long, skeletal. It traces along the Kevlar weave, pausing at the orange lenses covering my eyes. It taps against them. Tap. Tap. 

“Take this off, won’t you?” it asks. 

I shake my head. 

Laughter. Cold, empty, and endless. It fills the room, fills the whole damn world and it makes me want to turn myself inside out, makes me want to cut off my ears and stuff them into my mouth and chew and chew until they’re mulch. 

“No, you’re too afraid for that," it whispers. "Much too afraid.” A rustle of fabric. The shifting of air. It’s standing up now, and somehow I can feel the weight of its shadow fall across me, the pull of it, like it has its own strange gravity. “My mother only sends the cowards, she knows they’re more malleable, more pliable and twistable to her awful machinations.”

Mother. It keeps saying mother.

Earlier, I asked Dr. Driver if this thing was a person, and she told me it hadn’t been for a long time. Was the Aberration her son? Truly? I want to ask it, I want so desperately to know but after seeing what it did to the man in the box, I don't dare say a word.

“Answer me,” it hisses.

I stay quiet. I stay a shivering ball of piss and tears, and I don’t make a sound or open my eyes or even breathe. I’m frozen. A still-life of hopelessness and fear, and when I hear Dr. Driver bang on the door, I almost jump out of my skin. 

“That’ll be her,” says the Aberration, its words fading as it slinks back into the void. “It appears our time is up.”


There’s a groan of steel as the door creaks along its hinges. I scramble, turning toward it and opening my eyes to see a dim halo of light in the distance. In front of it is a black silhouette of a woman in a lab coat. Dr. Driver. “I won’t look,” she tells me, “but did you hear it leave?”

“I-I think,” I sputter, stumbling to my feet and hurrying to get out of there.

A palm slams into my shoulder. “Hang on," she says. "You're forgetting the flat bed. We can’t leave it behind.”

I swallow. 

"You've gotta be kidding me."

"Just be quick about it," she snaps.

I turn, dash into the room and grip the handles of the flatbed, and as I do I realize I’ve fucked up for the umpteenth time on my first day. I didn’t bother closing my eyes. How could I? I needed to see the damn flatbed and yet– there it is. In the dark. A tall shape, skeletal, its skin taut to its scarecrow frame and its jagged teeth a crimson red, while its hollowed-out eyes bleed dark bile.

It doesn’t say a word to me. It doesn’t need to. It simply waves a hand like a rake.

“I said be quick!” Dr. Driver snaps. “It could still be close by!”

I snatch the flatbed and wheel it back through the door. She slams it shut with a final, mechanical groan. “How did it go?” she asks, getting started on the locks. 

“How did it go?” I sputter, ripping off my mask. “There was a fucking person in the box!” 

“Yes. You can understand why I didn’t want to show you earlier.” She finishes with the last of the latches. “Come along. We’ve got a ways to go before we’re back at the lab.”

I push the flatbed. As we pass from the shadow of the doorway and into the dim lights, my stomach twists and vomit fills my mouth. I keel over, hand against the concrete wall and heave it out onto the floor. 

“Finished?” Dr. Driver asks.

I gasp, wiping my lips with my sleeve and looking back to flatbed in the corridor light. The wooden box is no more. It’s a scatter of splinters, but its contents are clearly visible. Or, whatever's left of them. 

There’s a man’s face on the cart. It’s caved in, the jaw shattered and the skull split open. Pieces of his brain are oozing onto the floor. His heart is sitting inside his split-open rib-cage, leaking red through serrated teeth marks. 

“Jesus Christ…” I mutter, looking away from him. “What is this place? This lab?”

“A necessary evil,” Dr. Driver says as we move down the hallway. “Outside of the nausea, how do you feel?”

“Terrible…”

“Did you speak to it?”

My voice trembles. “N-No.”

“Did you look at it?”

God help me. 

“No,” I lie.

She breathes a sigh of relief. “That’s good. That’s very good.”

“Hypothetically,” I say, trying to keep my voice even, “what if I *had* looked at it? What would happen to me?”

“The same thing that happened to Rico," she says, "You’d become ill. Soon after, you’d die.”

"Rico?"

She sighs. Reaches up to her face, pulls off her glasses and wipes a tear. “Apologies. Rico was a friend of mine, talking about him isn’t easy."

"I think I'm owed some details."

"Yes. I suppose you are." Dr. Driver takes a shuddering breath, then begins. "The Aberration... it's a curious weapon. A problematic one. So far we've been unable to wield it with any degree of control."

"Why?" I ask."

"Because it isn't straightforward. It isn't a physical force. It's much closer to a virus. It infects people. It leaks into their thoughts, begins to burrow into their minds, poisoning them and compromising their survival instincts.”

A shiver runs through. “Then that's what happened to Rico?”

She nods, solemn. “Yes. He looked at it. The Aberration, I mean. The lenses fitted to the masks are made to provide protection, but the protection is sparing– a glimpse and you’ll be fine, but to stare into it, to truly look upon that monster…" Dr. Driver shakes her head. "There’s no helping it. Rico made a mistake. A fatal one. Soon after his experience, he began to deteriorate. He became drawn toward the Aberration, as if caught up in its gravity, he wished to visit it again and again. We locked him up for his own safety. Soon though, he began harming himself, inching closer to suicide. He had a single demand.”

“What was it?” I croak. 

“To see the Aberration again," she says simply. "Rico pleaded with us, desperate. He wanted nothing more than to lay eyes on the monster one final time, nothing more than to be pulled back into its dark embrace.”

“Did he ever recover from that compulsion?"

“No,” Dr. Driver mutters, laughing darkly. “The effects of the Aberration aren’t akin to drug addiction. They’re an illness. Terminal. The reason the monster is so effective as a weapon, so terrifying, is that it has a mortality rate that could make rabies envious.” She pauses, narrowing her eyes at me. Studying me. “Are you feeling alright? You look a touch pale.”

“I’m fine,” I say quickly. “I’ve just…. I’ve never seen this much blood.”

Her mouth becomes a thin line. “Understandable. The first encounter is always a traumatizing experience. You have my apologies for that.”

My hands tighten around the handlebars, knuckles turning white. “So what happened to him?” I ask. “To Rico?”

Dr. Driver nods at the flatbed. She nods at the half-eaten face, the scatter of intestines, the split-open rib cage and brain matter tumbling onto the concrete floor. She nods at all of that, and then she tells me, “You’re looking at [him."](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCryptid)
