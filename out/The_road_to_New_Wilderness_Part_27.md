[\[Part 28\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17kv8x2/the_road_to_new_wilderness_part_28/)

Standing before the bathroom mirror in our room, I ran a brush through my damp hair to help it dry, and sighed.

*I wish I could just go straight to bed. Why did they have to set the election for tonight? Would it have killed them to put it off one more day?*

Our meeting in Sean’s office had gone about as smooth as I’d expected. Carter suggested that the beacon be turned over to him for security reasons, and Ethan brought up his past record of public executions, calling him a fascist. Dr. O’Brian demanded it be turned over to the Researchers so they could study it, and Carter recalled Dr. O’Brian’s efforts to restrict the market system in the fort, accusing her of being a communist. Ethan insisted the beacon be taken into custody by a joint force of New Wilderness staff, and Dr. O’Brian made a few snide remarks about capitalism just to dig at him, before implying that he didn’t have the education level to make such decisions. Sean got so frustrated with everyone’s squabbling that he threatened to strap the beacon to a hand grenade if a solution wasn’t found, to which Adam replied that Ark River would defend the beacon with force rather than see it destroyed. Eve said nothing, but stood by Adam’s side with her hand resting on the hilt of her cruciform sword, ready to defend him if anyone should attempt to force their way. Chris, Jamie, and I sat in the corner in silence, and only spoke when Sean asked for our version of events of the days prior. I made a point to leave out my run-in with the stranger in the yellow chemical suit, since I didn’t think any of the four New Wilderness officials would believe me. Everyone left the conference room in a foul mood, and I’d dragged myself up to the room Jamie and I shared just to get away from the bitter arguing that continued well out into the hallway.

I squeezed some toothpaste onto my toothbrush and tried to ignore the sky-blue color on the bristles.

*I wonder if Chris ever managed to talk any of the officials down from their tirades. Jamie is probably snuggled up with Andrew by now, assuming she gave up trying to convince Carter to cooperate with Sean. Of course, she and Chris might be somewhere together . . .*

The idea ached in my chest, worse than I thought it would, and I scrubbed harder at my teeth to hurry the process along. I had an alarm clock, a nice warm bed, and four whole hours until everyone in New Wilderness had to convene for the Assembly elections. They’d set the official vote for 7:00 PM, to be held in the visitor center parking lot, so no one could miss any of what went on. It was also a nice, big open space, so if anyone tried to start trouble, our marksmen from the wall could easily bring them down. With any luck, I could sleep through till the last moment, walk down to vote, and go right back to bed afterward.

*Knock, knock.*

Sliding through the open bathroom door, Jamie leaned against the doorframe, and let slide a sheepish half-smile. “Hey.”

I blinked at her in surprise and spat my toothpaste suds into the sink. “Hey. What are you doing back, I thought you were . . . well, I figured you and Andrew would, you know, catch up.”

Part of me had felt confused and jealous at how she’d flung herself into Andrew’s arms the second he’d come jogging up the hallway from the lodge lobby. Jamie already had a great guy, but whatever was going on between her and Chris had yet to run its course. It almost didn’t seem fair that she could vie for two separate people, likely unbeknownst to Andrew, while I had yet to find someone for myself. But still, I wanted to stick to my previous resolution; to be a friend first and foremost, no matter what it cost.

She shook her head, and a flicker of Jamie’s old wry humor poked through, even if for just a moment. “I promised him we’d spend time together after the whole Assembly mess is over. But I wanted to get to the market before it closed, so . . . here. Happy birthday.”

In her outstretched hands, Jamie offered a square bundle of blue cloth, atop of pair of cork-heeled wedge shoes with silver-colored straps. Upon taking the bundle in my hands, I watched in awe as a waterfall of azure material spilled out to reveal a silky dress, hand-woven from the artisan looms of the market.

I couldn’t help but run my hands over the soft material, and drank in the way it kissed my skin like butter. “I . . . I don’t know what to . . . how did you . . .”

“A little golden-eyed bird told me.” Jamie winked, her face brightening at my reaction. “I had to guess your size from the clothes you wear the most, but I think it should fit. The shoes were on sale, so naturally they had to come with.”

*Even if it doesn’t fit, I love it.*

A smile crossed my face before I had time to stop it. “Thank you. But you didn’t have to, you know. I mean, it’s just nice that someone actually remembered.”

Jamie’s happy countenance slipped, and she rubbed at one arm, both green eyes staring at the white floor tiles. “It’s more than that. I . . . I’ve been a terrible friend these past few days. Not just to you, but of everyone, you certainly didn’t deserve it. I know I can be hard to live with, and stubborn, but you’re one of the few people who never held it against me. So . . . I’m sorry, for being such a jerk.”

Under the light bulbs over the sink, I could see the tears glistening in Jamie’s eyes, and my hidden jealousy melted. For all her faults, the things she’d said, the secrets she’d kept from me, she was still my best friend, and the only sister I’d ever had.

Emotion welled in my throat, and I crossed the bathroom to wrap my arms around her as tight as I could. “I forgive you. Dress or no dress.”

Jamie sniffled, and I could tell by how hard she hugged me back that she fought to keep from breaking down. I wanted to tell her that I knew, that I’d heard her and Chris arguing, that I was willing to listen if she needed to talk, even if it killed me to hear it. But I couldn’t bring myself to say the words, knowing that it could push Jamie away from me once more, that she might put her internal walls back up and shut me out, which would be unbearable. I had my friend back, and it felt so good not to be alone in this little room, with the world such a harsh, unloving place.

“Well,” She pulled back and wiped at her eyes, the usual mischievous grin returning. “Go ahead, try it on. I can shut my eyes if you’re feeling squeamish.”

I rolled both of mine at her teasing and shucked my t-shirt and shorts to pull the dress over my head. It fit like a glove, the fabric light and smooth on my skin, the hem falling just above my knees in a swishy curtain. The neckline plunged further than my usual fare, but not far enough that Mom would have kept me from leaving the house, and I had to trade my gray cotton sports bra for a satin push-up one that Jamie brought from her closet. She wove my hair into some kind of pattern, and even daubed touches of makeup from a compact kit onto my face.

Jamie swabbed ruby-red lipstick over my lips and stood back to admire her handiwork. “Okay, take a look.”

Turning around, I stared at the mirror, my jaw slack.

*Whoa.*

A woman looked back at me from the polished glass, in a hand-stitched dress that hung on her slender frame in a gorgeous cascade of sapphire. Dark brown hair had been tied back in a princess-style weave, the makeup subtle but enough to make the cheeks glow, and both lips shone out with pronounced, seductive scarlet. Shapely long legs stuck out from inside the dress, and the stranger froze with the same stunned hazel eyes set inside a painted face.

“Are . . . are you okay?” Jamie squinted in concern. “We can try something else if you’re not—”

“I’m beautiful.” It came out as a half-choked sob, and my eyes blurred.

Never in all my life had I been able to claim that, never had I thought it, but now I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I didn’t look like some clumsy kid with a camera, a skinny girl who liked filmmaking, or the third wheel to anyone. In that amazing dress, with my skin shining like polished alabaster, and my lips red as a cardinal’s feather, all the cruel voices of internal criticism finally shut their mouths.

I nearly knocked Jamie over with a second hug, and she giggled, kicking the shoes my way. “Easy, you don’t want to smear your makeup. Put these on, and I’ll scrounge something up for myself. Then we can go see if the kabob stand is still open.”

My stomach rumbled in agreement, and I slid the shoes on while Jamie changed into a black evening gown. I helped her straighten the long bleach-blonde locks on her head, and Jamie spritzed me with some kind of fruity perfume. We left our weapons and war belts in the room, a foreign concept to me after the chaotic week prior and headed down the plush hall of the lodge to the lobby.

Instead of heading for the double doors at the front, Jamie veered left, and paused at the dark door of the massive first-floor ball room. “I need to make a quick stop here first. You wanna get the lights while I prop this door open?”

My eyebrows rose, but I stepped into the cavernous interior, and palmed the wall for a light switch.

Something shifted in the dark shadows, and I froze, every vein running ice cold.

“Jamie,” I breathed, my anxiety cranked up to a thousand, and backed away from the doors. “There’s something in there.”

She looked over her shoulder at me, and Jamie shook her head, but I couldn’t miss the dark outline of something sliding over the wall just behind her. “It’s just shadows, now help me find the—”

*Click.*

Bright white light exploded from everywhere, and I threw my hands up to cover both eyes out of instinct. I could almost hear the chitters in my memory, the screech-thumping of limbs on rubble in the ruined streets of Collingswood. Voices roared in from every side, and my heart pounded like a trip-hammer. I didn’t know how the Echo Spider had gotten in without anyone knowing, but without my weapon, or some kind of device to confuse it, Jamie and I were sitting ducks. We had to run, had to scream, had to do something, before the greasy cables snatched us up and . . .

*“Surprise!”*

The multitude of human voices shouted in glee, and it took my heart a moment to calm down, as my eyes adjusted.

Crowded inside the elegant ball room, people clapped and smiled, most in some kind of formal attire, though many seemed to have improvised in lieu of real dress clothes. Red, blue, and yellow streamers lined the walls, and a few balloons dotted the tables. Andrew stood near the door, his arm the object I’d seen on the wall, one work-stained hand still pressed to the light switch. A heady aroma of steamed rice and cooked beef wriggled into my nose, and heat flushed my cheeks at the realization of what I’d just walked into.

*“Happy birthday to you . . . happy birthday to you . . .”*

All around me, the rangers, workers, researchers, and Ark River folk broke into a rowdy chorus, and two of the kitchen girls wheeled out a little trolley with a large square cake on it, covered in white icing.

*“. . . happy birthday dear Hannah . . .”*

I tried to find words to speak, my mouth opening and closing like some marionette, but couldn’t manage anything. The chorus ended, and they all waited in expectation as the cake rolled to a stop in front of me.

*Is this a dream?*

“I know it’s kind of last-minute, but better late than never, eh?” Jamie gave me a gentle nudge toward the lit candles. “Alright, hurry up and make a wish. Something good, like a plane load of rifle ammo.”

I laughed in disbelief and leaned down to puff at the little burning wicks with all my might. Acrid candle-smoke filled my nostrils, and everyone cheered.

Someone brought out a working stereo, a precious commodity in a world with more ever failing electronics and put on an upbeat song. Couples paired up to dance on the big floor in the center of the room, while more chatted on the side, or got in line behind Jamie and I for food. Kitchen workers ladled out portions for us, and one of them opened a cooler to hand Jamie an amber colored wine bottle with the word *Port* on the label, along with a few glasses.

Balancing the plate that held my beef stroganoff and rice beside the one that held my slice of yellow birthday cake, I eyed the champagne flute she held out to me. “Oh, um . . . I’m 20, not 21.”

She blinked, and Jamie’s face crawled with a fond grin as she shook her head at me. “Hannah, we build our own automatic weapons, none of us have paid federal taxes since February, and I’m pretty sure one of the researcher boys has his own weed patch. Do you really think alcohol laws apply here?”

*Fair point.*

Still, I hesitated. I’d never drank alcohol before, and the few times I’d smelled the cheap beer sold at football games in high school, it hadn’t exactly endeared me to the stuff. Besides, I didn’t want to get drunk and puke like the some of the girls in the school parking lot after prom.

Jamie seemed to sense my unease, and her smile became gentler. “Don’t worry, this is beginner stuff, nice and sweet. Besides, I’ll look out for you. No refills, take light sips, and no drinking anything but what I bring for us, okay?”

That took a huge weight off my shoulders, and I accepted the glass in relief.

Despite the impromptu nature of the party, I found myself enjoying it more than any other. The food was delicious, and the wine wasn’t too bad, even if it did make me feel kind of fuzz-brained after I finished my glass. Jamie noticed my slight unsteadiness, and the next drink came as a glass of water with lemon, but I faced none of the pressure I expected for being such a lightweight in terms of alcohol consumption. In fact, instead of being the invisible wallflower of Louisville, I was stunned as people lined up to talk to me, asked me about our trip in the south, and prodded for my account of the spider nest. They treated me like some kind of celebrity, and some brought what little gifts they’d been able to find on such short notice to pile them up at my table. Baggies of .22 cartridges, new socks, a copy of Gulliver’s Travels, a hand-made wooden comb, and an oil-smudged slip of paper from Andrew that read, ‘I owe you one new handgun, AH’.

Under the weight of it all, I had to work extra hard just to keep from bawling like a baby, the tension from so many days smoothed over by this one act of extraordinary kindness.

*Is this what it’s like? Being popular? Having real friends?*

At one point, Jamie caught me sniffling, and her eyebrows shot to the roof. “Hey, what’s wrong? Is it the music? I can have them change it, we’ve got more CD’s and—”

“I’m okay.” I managed to push the sudden attack of emotion away and smiled through a red complexion. “I just . . . no one’s ever done anything like this for me. Usually its just me and my parents, maybe a few friends. This is nice.”

Through the old radio, another song came on, and people flocked to the dance floor in a loose square formation.

Jamie grabbed my hand, and tugged me to my feet, her eyes twinkling. “Come on, let’s dance.”

*Yikes.*

I shook my head, and my stomach churned. “I don’t really dance.”

“It’s easy.” Jamie pleaded, with a dramatic pouty lower lip stuck out that barely concealed her ornery grin. “Come on, just one. There’re so many people out there, no one will even see us.”

Every part of me wanted to stay right where I was, maybe go for another slice of cake, and avoid anything to draw more attention to myself. But Jamie seemed really excited, and there were a lot of people out there. I’d gotten this far by taking chances, hadn’t I?

*One dance can’t hurt.*

Limbs trembling in nervousness, I let her pull me to my feet, and into the morass of bodies we went.

At first, I felt ridiculous, and kept both eyes on the floor, placing my feet and turning my body in an effort not to screw up the pattern everyone used. But after a while, with Jamie beside me, I began to loosen up, and started to smile. It was kind of fun, dancing like this, and when the song changed, I stayed. Soon, Jamie and I were laughing and dancing like fools, too happy to care if anyone was watching, and for the life of my I couldn’t remember why I’d been so afraid of doing this.

When our sixth song came to an end, Jamie and I slipped over to the beverage table for water, breathless, and giggling like schoolgirls.

“See?” Jamie snickered and winked at me. “You just needed to unlock your inner party-animal. I knew you had it in—”

Her eyes drifted over my shoulder, and Jamie’s face changed, some of the color fading.

Confused, I turned, and spotted a figure not far away, standing by the double doors of the ballroom that led out onto the exterior deck, his maple-syrup colored hair dark in the aura of the setting sun. Chris wore a simple navy-blue blazer over a button-down white shirt with jeans, but even in that, he could have been a statue from the Greek pantheon for how his broad shoulders filled out the coat. He held a glass with some kind of dark brown liquid, and both sky-blue eyes landed on mine from across the room, sending jolts of electricity through my blood.

*Jamie. Jamie is right beside me, I can’t do anything. I won’t hurt her like that.*

Dragging my eyes away, I tried to ignore the gnawing sensation in my chest, and wished I could find another glass of Port. “Hey, you want to teach me gin rummy? One of the worker girls gave me a pack of cards. I can sneak some more cake if you want to find a place to . . .”

I looked up to find Jamie watching me with a melancholy smile, her emerald irises alight with a morose, knowing glint.

“Hannah, it’s fine.” She whispered, though the pain in her tone cut me to the soul. “I’ve got to get a few dances in with Andrew anyway. Go on.”

But I frowned, and refused to look toward Chris, afraid of what I might feel if I do. “No, seriously, I can—”

Jamie’s hand gripped mine, and she gave it a squeeze. “Get over there and wrangle that boy, or I’ll make you do another five rounds of the cha-cha-slide. Come on, he’s been waiting in that stupid corner all night. You want to make him think you don’t like him?”

There it was, out in the open, a direct challenge to the truth I’d been avoiding for days on end. If I’d been scared to try dancing, this terrified me, even more so for the agony etched across Jamie’s face. She wasn’t going to stop me, she wouldn’t interfere, but the thought that I could be a source of sorrow for Jamie was too much to bear.

I took a timid step back toward the crowd, and Jamie sighed in resignation.

“Hey, Dekker!” Her voice rang out above the nearby people, and before I could duck behind something, Jamie spun me around by the shoulders to push me toward Chris.

Whirling on my heel, I readied to snap at her, but Jamie had already vanished into the throng of people.

*You’ve got to be kidding me.*

“Hey.”

He stood only a few feet away, both of those dazzling blue eyes locked on me, a warm half-smile on his rugged face. Up close, I could appreciate the way his white shirt hugged Chris’s muscled torso, not tight, but snug enough to make me envy it. I could smell the chocolate scented cologne on his skin from where I stood, and he’d shaved so that his chiseled jawline ran smooth in the light of the ball room. Chris held out another glass to me, one filled with a similar brown drink to his own, and the way his teeth glowed pearly white made my feet stick to the floor.

“H-Hey.” I rasped, and eyed the drink he offered, unsure now if I wanted another dose of dizzying alcohol.

Chris seemed to sense my unease and swirled the glass. “It’s just root beer. Nothing strong, I promise.”

I could use something fizzy right about now.

Grateful for something to occupy my shaking hands, I gripped the round champagne goblet, and swallowed some of the sugary soda. “Thanks.”

“So . . . happy birthday.” Chris shuffled his feet, and cleared his throat, as if he couldn’t decide what words to use. “Sorry if I haven’t come by before, it’s been kind of a busy night. Trying to keep certain members of the party from biting each other’s heads off.”

He lowered his voice and gestured to the crowd with his pointer finger.

Now that he mentioned it, I realized all the important officials were here, Sean, Ethan, Carter, and Dr. O’Brian in various places throughout the crowd, along with Adam and Eve.

“Are they still mad?” I rubbed my thumb across the condensation on my glass, and searched for weapons among the crowd, finding none, but unconvinced that they weren’t there.

Chris shrugged and gulped some of his pop in a weary sigh. “They’re coming around. I think I can get Sanderson, O’Brian, and the Stirlings to agree on a common policy as far as the beacon is concerned, but Carter is a wild card. He’s hated me ever since the uprising, so who knows what he’ll do.”

*With all that firepower at the mechanical garage, I’d hate to find out.*

I chewed my lower lip, tasted the tang of my lipstick, and wondered if I should go back to my room for my gun or not, with the vote closing on us in only a few hours.

“I’m sorry.” He cleared his throat, and Chris tinged a deeper shade of red around his cheekbones, in a way that almost made him appear more like a kid in a suit rather than a man. “Here I am talking shop when it’s your special day. I, uh . . . I have something for you.”

My eyebrows curled upward, and I followed him through the double doors, out into the cool evening air of the deck.

It was much quieter outside, with no one else at the rustic knotty pine railing, and a soft breeze ruffled my hair from the south. Swathes of red, orange, and golden light decorated the sky as the last bit of sunshine slid below the horizon, and a few stars began to appear in crystalline twinkles. Various animals called to each other from our pastureland and from the wilderness beyond, fireflies turning the grassy meadows into a sea of luminescent green pinpricks. Woodsmoke hung faint on the wind, mixed with the sweet aroma of Lantern Roses and other Breach-born plants. It was a sight that had both awed and terrified me on my fist day, but now, it stood as a mere backdrop to the mysterious boy who leaned down to retrieve a little square object from behind a rail post.

Chris shuffled my way, and his eyes arrested mine with a ripple of something in them that I clung to with my own hungry gaze.

The slightest glimmer of hope.

“I didn’t have much when I crash-landed here.” He held one arm behind his back, and both Chris’s ears turned cherry red, like he too had to fight just to breathe. “But I did have some personal stuff, and since you like film, I figured this would be something you could use way more than me. I hope you like it.”

He brought his arm around in front of him, and in Chris’s hand rested a small brown leather box.

It seemed to be some sort of case, with a bronze-colored hasp, so I set my drink on the nearby railing to pry it open with tentative fingers.

*Oh wow.*

Nestled inside, a small gray and black digital camcorder peeked out at me, one of the nicer ones that I’d seen online for prices far beyond my reach, with a nylon carry strap and a charging cable for a built-in lithium battery. A lining of tin foil acted as a shield against the electromagnetic effects of the Breach, and a small white card had been stuck into the lid.

Peeling it out, I opened the card flap to find a surprising array of neat, handwritten cursive words pressed into the thick paper with ebony ink.

*Hannah,*

*An incredible person deserves an incredible gift. Hope I can get you something like that someday, when all this is over. Maybe we could go somewhere nice for coffee or dinner. Until then, this camera is yours to conquer the world with. I know you’ll put it to good use.*

*Sincerely,*

*Christopher Rodrick Dekker*

My heart stopped, and I swayed on my feet. I had to re-read the card a few times just to be sure it was real, and that I hadn’t imagined the words through a haze of beginner-wine dizziness.

Coffee. Dinner. He wanted to have those with *me*.

The world spun, everything a jumbled chaotic mess inside my head. Chris liked me. He liked me and wanted to go out with me. For the first time in my entire existence, someone wanted to be with me, and I wanted to be with him. I could see it in my mind’s eye, us at a coffee shop during a snowy day, us at a nice Italian restaurant pretending to be fancy people, us at the county fair holding hands in line for corn dogs. I could already feel his arms around me, imagined his lips on mine, the heady sensation of him whispering my name so softly that chills ran down my spine. Dear God, I wanted that, like I’d never wanted anything before.

*What do I do? What do I say? I can’t, Jamie would . . . but she said . . . and he’s so . . . oh Hannah, how do you get yourself into these things?*

“I, um.” Clutching the camera to my chest, I flicked my eyes up to meet his, and dared to let the warmth in my core spread through me like a tide of liquid fire. “This is really . . .”

Motion flickered over Chris’s left shoulder, and everything screeched to a halt.

Several fingers of light, so distant that I almost didn’t catch them in the fading glow of the day, arched into the sky in a familiar, eerie pattern. Images flashed through my brain, memories not my own that I’d seen in a cursed place, where horrible things had been done to stain the earth with innocent blood.

*No.*

Ignorant of what was happening behind him, Chris’s face fell into disappointed confusion as I tore away to dash back into the ball room, heart pounding in my chest.

“Rockets!” I screamed over the music and waved my arms to draw all eyes to me. “There are rockets coming! *It’s an airstrike!*”
