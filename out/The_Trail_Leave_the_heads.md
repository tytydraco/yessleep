My therapist keeps telling me I need to go outside more, to reconnect with the things I used to enjoy. As a kid, I practically lived in the woods climbing trees, making forts, running trails until the sun went down. But somewhere around high school, I lost that part of myself. These days I feel more disconnected than ever, trapped in my own head. She said nature could help, that walking among trees might quiet the noise inside me. So here I am, giving it a try. I live with my roommate, Mike, and luckily our place sits right by a massive forest. There’s a trail that winds deep into it, and I figured it might be a good place to start these so-called “therapy nature walks.”

Day 1

I’ve officially started exploring the woods behind my house. My therapist has been pushing me to spend more time outdoors, to “connect with nature,” so I figured I’d start small with the forest that’s practically in my backyard basically . I also decided to blog about it. Supposedly, if this gets popular enough, I might even make a little money. Heh, who knows.

Anyway, today was more about easing into things. I didn’t go far, just wandered enough to look around. I stumbled across some mushrooms I think they’re called jack-o’-lantern mushrooms, but honestly, I’m not an expert. I also spotted a deer and a fawn. Pretty sure it’s the same pair I’ve seen wandering around the front yard recently.

Of course, it wasn’t all peaceful. The bugs were everywhere. I’ll be real with you. I can't stand them. Their twitchy little legs, the clusters of eyes, the way they crawl over everything. Gross. Just gross.

So yeah, that was pretty much it for today. Nothing too exciting, but it’s a start. I’ll be back out here tomorrow.



Day 2

Hello again. Right now, I’m on my way to a creek my older neighbor, Bob, told me about. Apparently, it’s just up the hill, a small one, nothing dramatic. Supposedly, it’s quiet, relaxing, and perfect for calming anxiety.Bob said he’d go there after he lost his daughter to clear his mind. Since that’s the whole point of me being out here, I figured I’d check it out.

I think I’m getting close. There are critters moving around near the waterline. Wait there’s even a deer in there? I didn’t know deer could swim. Fun fact, I guess. Maybe this is turning into some kind of wildlife blog. Ha.

Okay, I see it now. There’s a bush blocking the way, but I think I can yeah, I found a path through. Alright, so I’ve made it to the creek. But that “swimming deer” I thought I saw? It wasn’t swimming. It was just the head. The head of a deer floating in the water.

The creek isn’t calm and sparkling like I imagined. The water is red. Blood. That’s… unsettling. Suddenly I’m hoping there aren’t any bears around. I do not need that kind of stress.

There’s a trail leading away from here, so I think I’ll follow that instead. Funny thing is, I've heard rumors about this very trail. People stopped using it after a girl went missing nearby aka Bobs daughter. Last seen heading this way during a stormy night. Kind of her own fault, right? Wandering out in weather like that. Still, the thought of it makes the hairs on my arms stand up.

Anyway, back to the trail. It winds through the forest hills and goes deep into the woods. I doubt I’ll go that far today, but maybe tomorrow. Assuming tomorrow comes, of course. The idea of running into a bear keeps creeping into my mind. I know I shouldn’t dwell on it, but hey it’s always a possibility.

So far, all I’ve found are more mushrooms and strange plants I can’t identify. If anything interesting pops up, I’ll let you know. Otherwise, I’ll sign off for now. Same time tomorrow? Heh. Yeah.













Day 3

Alright, Day 3. This time I’m not alone. My roommate came along, and he brought his dog, Pickle. He’s a St. Bernard-Husky mix, full of energy, chasing after everything that moves. Honestly, that probably means no animal sightings today.

I told my roommate about the deer head I found yesterday. His reaction was weirdly casual. He said he’s never heard of a bear leaving just the head behind, so he figures it was probably hunters. Makes more sense than a picky bear, I guess.

We made it farther along the trail than I did yesterday. Beyond where I turned back, it’s just endless forest. Trees, grass, mud, the usual. Miles and miles of it. But it feels less heavy having someone to talk to. Not just my own thoughts rattling around in my head.

Oh, and in case you’re wondering how I’m “writing” while hiking it’s speech-to-text. That’s why the tone sometimes comes off weird. I usually clean it up before posting. Sometimes it even records conversations, like this one between me and my roommate:



(Roommate): “The girl who went missing? She actually lived a house down from us. Her family still does.”

(Me): “Wait, really? I didn’t know she was that close.”

(Roommate): “Yeah. She was super social, always exploring these woods. Came back with stories about what she found abandoned buildings, strange trees, animal corpses. You name it. Once she got started, she wouldn’t stop. I think her disappearance is tied to her adventures. Probably found something she wasn’t supposed to.”

(Me): “Hold up, you mean there’s stuff out here? More than just trees? Buildings? Cars? Man, I don’t wanna end up like her… but honestly, finding cool stuff could be fun. And distracting.”

(Roommate): “Yeah, there’s all kinds of things. Old cars, caves, even buildings. Not common, but they’re out here. She was the only one who really knew where though.”



So yeah, apparently this forest is hiding way more than I realized. Once I know the safer, familiar parts better, I might start exploring deeper. Not alone though. And definitely not in storms. I’m not repeating her mistakes. Still, I wish I could’ve talked to her. She probably saw things no one else ever has. But let’s be real, she's most likely dead. No body was ever found, but no one looked very hard either.



Anyway, today took a turn. We’d made it maybe a fifth of the way along the trail when a man suddenly came running toward us. At first, I thought he was just a jogger. But the closer he got, the stranger he seemed. He had a heavy southern accent which was weird, since we don’t even live in the South. And he kept muttering frantically:

“You best get going. Back that way ain’t no good. Ain’t no good, not at all. Get going. You ain’t welcome there. Me neither, okay?”

The words tumbled out like he was being chased. He wasn’t dressed like a hiker either. Wore a work vest and jeans, moving fast, eyes darting everywhere. Maybe drugs? Maybe something else. Whatever it was, we weren’t sticking around to find out. We turned back. I didn’t ask him what he meant about “not being welcome,” and honestly? I don’t think I want to know.



Day 5

After yesterday’s bizarre encounter, I decided to try a different part of the forest. This time, I brought Pickle with me again. He’s huge part St. Bernard, part Husky and honestly, his size alone makes me feel safer. No one’s messing with me while he’s around.

I chose a more local area today, one with joggers and hikers. There are even three small cabins scattered nearby. Feels more lived-in, less remote. Still, I couldn’t shake the memory of that man from yesterday. Who was he? Why was he running?

The place was crowded practically the whole town seemed to be out. Controlling Pickle in a crowd is no easy task. He tugged, lunged, tried to jump on kids. After wrestling with him for a while, I decided to move farther out. Not too deep into the woods, but away from the bustle. Every spot I tried before was packed. One even had children playing, and Pickle nearly joined them. Total chaos.

So here I am again, back on the forest trail, despite swearing I wouldn’t. I’m not planning to go deep. Just far enough for some quiet. And honestly? The walk’s been… peaceful. I was starting to relax when

(Editing me here. The voice-to-text cut out at the worst moment.)

The last thing it picked up was me yelling: “Oh my God, I dropped the leash! Pickle! Pickle, come back!” He tugged hard enough to rip it right out of my hands. Before I could react, he was gone. I shouted his name, but he didn’t come back. Panic sank in. My roommate is going to kill me if I don’t find him.

Now I have no choice. I have to go after him.

Should I call my roommate for help and get screamed at? Or do I try to find Pickle alone? It’s already late. I think… I have to call him.



After the Call

So here’s what happened next. I called Mike. The second he met up with me, he let me have it.



“What the hell, dude!? You just let him run off? How could you let this happen? This is ridiculous. Which way did he go? You’re so weak you can’t even hold down a dog? He’s out here in this massive forest and you just let him disappear? You thought taking him to the busiest part of the park, knowing damn well you can’t control him, was a good idea? Do you realize how stupid that is? That’s like my child out here, and he could get hurt!”

I stammered, “I’m so sorry, Mike. I didn’t know he was that bad on a leash. I honestly thought I could handle him. I just wanted to bring him along, especially after what happened yesterday, you know—”

Mike cut me off immediately. “Yeah, yesterday. Whatever freaked that grown man out could be after my dog right now, thanks to you! You put him in this situation!”

Something in me snapped. I yelled back, “Well maybe your dog should be trained better! I chased after him, called his name, and he didn’t even look back. That’s not just on me I didn’t do this on purpose!”

He froze, then sighed. “Fine. You didn’t do it on purpose. But damn, man, you still let him run out here. I’m scared. I don’t know what’s in these woods.”

His voice softened.

I told him, “Pickle’s a big dog. He’ll probably be fine until we find him.”That ended the argument. We walked the trail for hours, calling for Pickle. No response. We even contacted the local wildlife patrol, but they shrugged us off. Said they couldn’t go past the fourth section of the trail. Totally useless.



By now, it was completely dark.



8:43 PM Recording

Okay, it’s 8:43 PM and still no sign of Pickle. For the record, Pickle’s a dumb name, but this is serious. He could be dead, for all I know.



I split off from Mike because he was sick of me “narrating.” But you never know what might happen better to document.



Oh my God. I just heard yelping. It sounds like Pickle. I think it’s him. “Pickle!” I’m running now. The sound’s getting louder. He’s nearby.



Wait… it’s coming from inside a building.



My flashlight’s crap, but I can see enough to tell it’s big. Covered in plants. No graffiti, though. Strange. It looks abandoned.



Pickle’s cries are echoing from inside.



But then what the hell. A voice. A deep, female voice, distant but clear:



“No. Quiet.”



Please tell me this thing recorded that.



I froze. My whole body wanted to run. I love dogs, but Pickle isn’t worth dying for. Not over this. I’m not telling Mike what I just heard. He’d risk his life for that dog. Not me.



I’ll tell him in the morning. Hopefully by then, I’ll figure out how to explain this without sounding insane.



I’m leaving now. If I head downhill, I’ll eventually hit the trail.



Next Morning

Early morning update. I told Mike I “might” have heard Pickle crying farther up the trail. I also mentioned the building not the voice. Mike lit up immediately: “Okay, great. You’re showing me where you heard it.”

So now I’m limping along beside him. My legs ache from all the running yesterday, but I don’t have a choice.

We’ve made it about two sections into the trail. For context, I think there are five total. I told him the cries were closer to the third section. He asked what else I saw, and I caved. I mentioned the voice.

“What do you mean, voice?” he demanded.

I tried to play it down. “I just… when I heard the cries, I also thought I heard someone. A faint voice outside the building. Not sure, it was dark.”

Mike exploded. “And you’re just now telling me this? What if someone took him!?”

I stuttered, “Well, uh… maybe it’s good there’s a voice. Maybe it’s just a squatter keeping him safe.”

Mike buried his face in his hands, shaking, like he was about to break down. Then he started screaming Pickle’s name and ran off.

Now I’m alone.

Later That Morning

“Mike! Mike!” No answer. He can’t have gotten that far ahead. He’s not a runner. I’ve been jogging, and I still can’t find him.

Wait. The building. It’s here. The same one.

I’m going in.

Inside the Building

Okay. My phone died earlier, so this part is from memory.

I shouted for Mike and Pickle, but got nothing. Then, a loud thud. Followed by a muffled voice. Female. Broken English. I didn’t catch all of it, but it chilled me.

I crept deeper, keeping low. The place is an abandoned lab or maybe a hospital. Rusted cages lined the walls. Some held skeletons, mostly animals, though a few were… harder to identify. Broken bottles and glass littered the ground, labels faded but still faintly scientific. Plants forced their way through cracked tiles. Bugs swarmed over everything.

I found a cage with a nest built inside. And then I heard it Pickle’s yelp, faint but close.

I followed the sound into a room that reeked so strongly it made me vomit. Piles of bones. Rotting corpses. Animal heads. Some were intact torsos, ripped open like something had fed on the hearts.

And one corpse was human.

A girl. Long strands of brown hair clung to the decomposing skull. Most of the body was gone, but there was enough left to see what she was. My stomach turned. The missing girl. It had to be her.

Then I heard it again the voice. And Pickle’s whine.

I ducked behind a broken counter.

That’s when she walked in.

An impossibly tall figure, hunched but still towering. At least eight feet. She was holding Pickle by the neck like a toy.

She saw me.

She stared.

I thought I was going to die.

Then she threw Pickle to the ground. He yelped, scrambled, and bolted toward me. I didn’t think I just ran. Pickle ran with me.

We sprinted until I crashed into someone.

Mike.



He grabbed me, saw the terror on my face, and without a word, we both ran. Ran until our lungs burned and our legs gave out.



We collapsed on the grass, barely making it out of the forest. Pickle lay beside Mike, dirty, covered in spider webs, limping from an injured leg.

When I caught my breath, I told Mike everything I saw the corpse, the giant girl. He just stared at me like I’d lost my mind.But I know what I saw. The Following Days We haven’t gone back since. I haven’t even stepped near the forest. But it’s gnawing at me. I have to know if what I saw was real.

Everyone I’ve told thinks I’m crazy. Delusional. But I can’t let it go.

I’m going back today. Mike insists on coming probably to prove I’m nuts.

We’re packing this time: bear repellent, rope, first aid, water, ice packs, flashlights, even a few weapons.

If the building is real and if she is real then this time, I’ll have proof.

We left before sunrise, backpacks heavy with gear rope, flashlights, knives, first aid, even a rusty hammer Mike insisted on bringing. Without Pickle trotting along, the silence between us felt sharper.



The hike

The forest swallowed us whole. For six hours we walked, our boots crunching dirt and dead leaves, but no birds sang, no bugs buzzed. Not even the wind moved the branches. It was as if the woods themselves were holding their breath, waiting.

By the fifth hour, sweat glued my shirt to my back. Mike’s breathing grew loud and ragged, his broad shoulders heaving under the straps of his pack. He didn’t say a word, but the tight grip he kept on his flashlight told me everything.

When the building came into view, my stomach sank. The first time I saw it, it looked like the forest was swallowing it vines over the doorway, plants covering the walls. But now, the doorway was bare. The vines had been ripped down, shredded, like someone or something had torn them away to make the entrance clear.

Mike muttered, “That’s… not how we left it.”

I didn’t answer. My legs were shaking too hard.

Inside the Building

The air inside was damp, thick with mildew and something rotting. Every step echoed too loud on cracked tile floors. Rusted pipes hung from the ceiling like veins, and broken glass crunched under our boots.

We passed empty cages, some with bent bars, others with locks that had been forced open. Old clipboards lay scattered, the papers yellow and water-stained. Words like Subject and Trial No. 14 flashed in the beam of Mike’s light.

Neither of us spoke.

Finally, we reached the room.



The Room of Bodies



The smell hit first. Sweet rot. My throat closed up. Bones littered the ground animal skeletons mostly, but in the corner, the half-rotted remains of a human girl slumped against the wall.

Mike’s flashlight trembled as it lit her face or what was left of it. His voice cracked. “Melissa. It… it might be her.”

His eyes watered, his lips quivering, but he held the light steady. For the first time since I’d known him, Mike looked small.

I lowered my head, unable to speak.

That’s when I felt it. A touch. Light fingers brushing my hair.

Mike’s scream shattered the silence. “WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?”

I looked up.

She was towering over me, bent forward to fit in the room. Skin stretched too tight over bone. Long, filthy hair tangled around her face. Fingers cracked and crooked, nails yellow and jagged. Her enormous eyes stared into mine, unblinking.

She tugged at my hair like a child inspecting a toy.

Her mouth opened. Dry, broken words scraped out:

“…soft.”

Her head tilted, eyes flicking between me and Mike. She reached toward him with her other hand, brushing his short hair with cracked nails.

Mike froze, trembling, tears streaming silently down his face.

The woman’s lips moved again. “…people. Not… seen… people.” Her voice was rough, like she hadn’t used it in years.

I tried to back away, but she yanked my hair tighter. Pain shot across my scalp, forcing me still.

Her stomach growled. Loud. Deep.

She whispered, “Hungry. Always… hungry.”



Her Broken Words

Mike raised his hands slowly, palms out. His voice shook. “We we’re not here to hurt you. We’re just looking—”

Her eyes widened. She repeated the word in a broken echo. “…hurt. Hurt me.” She shook her head violently, hair whipping. “Not bad. Not… monster. Just… hungry.”

Drool ran from her cracked lips. She leaned down closer, her breath hot, rancid, making me gag.

“Eat?” she whispered, tilting her head. “Need. To stay. Alive.”

Her mouth opened wider than it should, jagged teeth glistening in the light. She lowered toward me.



The Struggle



Mike snapped out of his freeze. He lunged forward, yanking her hand off my head and swinging the hammer hard into her temple.

The blow echoed through the room. She stumbled back, screeching, clutching her skull.

“NO! NO!” she wailed, voice breaking into static-like cracks. “I… not bad! Just… need…”

But her need twisted. Her eyes rolled, her jaw snapped wide, and she lunged at Mike.

He blasted her with bear spray, the mist covering her face. She shrieked, stumbling back, claws raking across the wall.

“BURNS! HURTS!” she cried, her words broken, guttural. “Not… fair! Just… hungry…”

Her voice cracked into sobs, twisted between pain and rage. “I… alone. So long… alone.”



The Escape



oWe didn’t wait. Mike grabbed my arm, shouting, “RUN!”

We bolted down the hallway, flashlights shaking wildly, footsteps pounding. Behind us, her screeches echoed, her fists smashing into walls as she staggered after us.

“COME BACK!” she cried, her words echoing down the corridor. “Don’t… leave me! Please… need… people…”

Her footsteps thundered closer. We burst through the entrance, crashing into branches and vines, running until my chest burned and my legs buckled.

When we finally stopped, the building was swallowed by the forest behind us. The only sound was our gasping breaths.

Mike collapsed to the ground, shaking his head. “She… she wasn’t even… evil. Just…” His voice broke. “She just wanted to live.”

The ID Card

I spotted something in the dirt, half-buried under leaves. I picked it up.

An old ID badge. The photo was faded, but the face was hers the same wide eyes, the same hair, before it became tangled and filthy.

Name: \[2056834\]. Division: Genetic Trial -Human Adaptation Project.

My chest tightened. She wasn’t born a monster.

She was made one.

A failed experiment abandoned in a crumbling lab. Left to rot. Left to starve.

And now, she lived here. Feeding on anything unlucky enough to wander in.

Her voice echoed in my head even as I stared at the card:

“Not my fault."
