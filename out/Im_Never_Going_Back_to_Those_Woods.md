I only packed the essentials: food, water, a lighter, and a shovel. Just a couple of days in the woods I haven’t seen in years, and then I’ll never have to think about this dreadful place again. I’ll stay sober, keep moving forward, and finally leave the past where it belongs. I just need to find our old hangout. The spot where we used to fish, hunt, and drink too much for our own good.

It took me hours, marching through the warm, humid air, swatting bugs off my neck and face. I didn’t stop until I found it. A small clearing by a pond, surrounded by trees that look older than the state itself. Back then, they were just scenery for a couple of drunk teenagers. Now they feel heavier, drained of color, like they’re grieving right along with me.

I can still see where we used to camp out, a small clearing barely big enough for a tent and campfire. The clearing still looks the same, the trees are only a little taller, but everything looks the same, but it seems quieter. Once filled with the sounds of birds and small animals, now it's absolutely silent. I don't think I can even hear the rustling of the leaves, just silence. But this was definitely the spot that I have to set up camp.

Setting up camp was quick, it was still second nature. Hopefully I don't have to spend too long here, every minute feels like the pit in my stomach grows larger. I just have to push forward, after all I have three days left and I can do this, I know I can! I just have to find the big dead tree and this nightmare will be put behind me.

I dropped a few sticks into the fire pit and sparked the lighter. It caught fast. Dry leaves crackled under the flames, the sound sharper than it should’ve been. Like the forest was listening. I sat back against a log, arms resting on my knees, watching the flames dance.

I told myself I’d feel better once I ate something, but the food sat heavy in my bag, untouched. My appetite had died the second I stepped into the clearing. I hadn’t been here in over a decade, but it felt like no time had passed at all. The trees hadn't changed. The pond still shimmered in the distance, though the water looked darker now. Murky. Like it was hiding something.

The wind picked up, but only slightly. Not enough to cool me down, just enough to move the trees a little. I waited for the familiar sound of branches swaying, leaves rustling. But it never came. The trees moved, but they didn’t make a sound. Just that awful quiet, so full it made my ears ring.

I should’ve turned on some music. Something to break the silence. But it didn’t feel right, not here. Not with what I came to do.

I pulled the old map from my bag, the one we used back in high school when we thought we were explorers. We’d drawn little notes in the corners, jokes, names of deer trails, spots we found beer cans or old bones. I ran my finger along the smudged ink until I found it. The big dead tree. That was the marker. The place where it happened. I stared at it longer than I needed to, like I expected the map to say more.

A branch cracked in the distance. My head snapped up, heart thudding, but there was nothing. Just trees. Still trees.

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.

"Just a deer," I told myself. Or maybe the heat got to me. That made sense. Humid air, no sleep, stress, it was a recipe for nerves. But I still grabbed the flashlight from my pack and checked the edges of the clearing, just in case.

The woods looked different in the dark. Like they were watching me back. Every branch looked like an arm reaching, every hollow like an open mouth. The fire cast long, strange shadows that didn’t quite match the trees that made them. I shook my head and went back to the log. I needed to sleep.

I told myself I could start fresh in the morning. I’d find the tree. I’d dig. I’d be in and out before the third night. Then I’d go home and never look back.

But even as I closed my eyes, I couldn’t help feeling like something was waiting. Not behind me, not around me, under me. Like the ground itself remembered. And it didn’t want to forget.

I closed my eyes and I started to hear something, a raspy breath. I told myself that it was probably something scrubbing against the tent or something and closed my eyes again. As soon as my eyelids closed again, the raspy breathing picked up, along with a chilling breath against my face. This time I woke up and turned the lamp on turning around looking, but I saw nothing.

I tried to ignore it and sat down distracting myself now that I no longer planned to sleep. I just played on my phone for a bit until I heard the trees moving, the sound of the wood bending was so loud and sounded like a tree was about to fall, so I ran out to check, but again there was nothing. Just the dark silhouettes of trees swaying around as normal. I feel like I'm losing my mind! This can't be right!

This is the point I decided to go ahead and dig in the dark, I don't care that I can't see, but clearly the place is getting to me. But as I went to grab my shovel, it was missing. Did I place it somewhere else? I could have sworn I left it by the tree. But I just don't see it. I keep looking around and around and around finally deciding maybe I left it somewhere else and I start backtracking my steps earlier.

I just kept walking around with my flashlight which might as well have just been a glow stick given how dull the light seemed, but I kept searching. I walked around until I saw something move. It looked like a snake, kind of? The issue is it looked off. I shined my light around and all I saw were the trees. But I kept cautious and kept on walking.

This is getting crazy, but I probably should just head back before I get lost. As I was turning back I saw something slither again and jumped back and soon I saw more snakes slithering and while frozen still fog was covering the woods. I've never seen fog this thick roll from the pond, but I didn't care to think about it and just ran. I ran fast and tripped over a root falling face first.

I think I lost consciousness for a good minute because I could see the sun was coming up a little. It was still dark, but everything was clear. I staggered to my tent and laid down for another hour. I rested up with the absolute silence by the pond and woke back up wishing I was feeling refreshed. I still have two more days left and I need to get on it.

I went searching for my shovel again and found it, somehow it ended up in a small tree. A smarter man would have left at this moment, but I could not afford to be that smart. So I climbed up and grabbed it. I felt a sense of accomplishment and finally made my way back to the old dead tree and sighed before I started digging. I kept digging and digging, but nothing. I was digging until it was dark and I was surrounded by dirt around me in a hole that was at least six or seven foot deep.

It was dark, I was without a light and I had to climb back out, but the ground had different plans. Every attempt I made at climbing led to the dirt collapsing in my hands and me falling down. I kept trying though. At one point I had my hand at the top and was pulling myself up and then something but my hand. It felt like a hundred fire ants at once. I fell down screaming in pain and looking up. And at that moment I could have sworn that I saw something looking down, but it was gone before I could focus.

I laid back for a moment to breathe before trying to get up and then I heard that raspy breathing again. I looked around, but I couldn't find a source. I actually felt fear, real fear. I had to get out! But I kept falling down and the breathing was getting louder and surrounded me, it began to almost sound like a haunting laugh. I was nearly in tears as I began to climb. I kept going until I finally made it, although I wish I didn't.

I saw something, the same thing looking at me earlier. It was a human like shadow with white dots for eyes staring at me and an almost glowing grin cracked on its face like a crack in the wall from ear to ear stretched thin. I can't even tell if I'm going crazy or if I'm seeing this, but I want out, I don't care about finding it anymore!

I attempted to run to my truck as this shadow followed me at a slow pace, the trees began to move and away like extensions of its arms. I kept looking back to make sure it wasn't close and all it took was one time before it finally smacked me in the face with a branch. I came falling down in pain. The roots grabbed my ankles and dragged me back to the tree.

I was stuck as the shadow laughed loudly with all the respiness of the breathing it was doing. It watched me sitting down crossing its legs. It just looked at me like someone would look at an old friend. I don't know how long it took, but it just randomly flew in a blind rage and the trees began to bend like rope and he threw a branch at me like a spear, he missed, but kept going until it noticed the sun and retreated.

Soon I fell down and decided this would be the best time to finally run to my truck. I ran fast and finally made it out of the woods, but I guess my timing could not have been any worse because this is when I saw the blue lights and the cops began walking out with dogs. I didn't know what to do at this point, except run back.

I could hear the footsteps as they began searching "DAMN IT THEY'LL FIND THE HOLE!" I ran quickly to where I was digging, and was shocked to find it was filled, so I took off not wanting to think about it. I could hear the officers stopping and saying they found upturned soil. But just like me they couldn't find it.

They continued searching as I kept hiding, but this little game only continued until the sun began to drop. This is when I knew it was going to get bad.

I tried making it to my truck, but sure enough nature had other plans and stopped me once again. I wasn't the only one, I could hear the officers yell and the dogs cry out, but it seems it was not as interested in them as it was me, because I heard wet sounds and screams from the officers and dogs, as I heard another officer screaming out wanting to leave.

I was dragged back to the camp site where the last officer remained. He was trapped, just like I was and was pinned next to the bodies of its other victims. He struggled to get free, but it was no use. I struggled to turn to him "we have to wait for the sun, it seems to be the only thing that stops it". The officer was freaking out "what even is it??" he kept trying to break free.

I think I knew what it was, but I have to keep it to myself and focus on escaping. This thing kept toying with us and it seemed even the insects listened to it as we were swarmed with various ants and beetles, eventually even the spiders began to crawl on us and we could do nothing but struggle as it laughed.

I had one other plan, it was the last thing I would have ever wanted, but it beats what we this was. I yelled out "fine, I'll do what I should have done, just let us go!" and it seemed that it responded to my plea and it released us, for the most part. It still had a root wrapped around our ankles as I cleared my throat. "Could you at least show us what we were searching for? I feel it may help with this."

The thing listened again as the dirt looked like wet sand and soon a partially mummified skeletal body emerged covered in roots and insects. "I'm guess you were looking for this too?" I asked the officer as he stood in absolute horror. "This is Justin Matthews, he disappeared about twelve years ago at the age of seventeen. And he was my best friend."

The officer looked at me as I looked back up with tears in my eyes. "We loved coming here, we camped here, would even drink beer out here, but that was the problem. I would drink a little too much and even would develop an addiction. I didn't mean to, we were just being stupid teens and we were drunk. We got hungry while camping and was hammered, so we had the stupid idea to start hunting." The officer knew where this story was going.

"I pulled my rifle out and we started to hunt. Nothing was coming around and we got bored. And while drunk and bored I decided to point my gun at him, right towards his chest and tell him I could easily kill him here and nobody would know. Of course it was just a horrible joke, and even he laughed, but the joke became a cruel reality because I moved too much from laughter and... **BAM** my gun went off. I looked up and was struck with regret as I saw him holding his gut and he was falling down in pain. I didn't know what to do and freaked out."

"Why didn't you take call 911?" I was practically sobbing at this point "I was scared! I was a kid who didn't want to go to jail, but I also didn't want him to die. But unfortunately he did. He suffered for hours before dying. I dragged him to that tree and spent the whole night digging." The officer hung his head in shame and I fell down on my knees before the roots receded.

"Alexander Shoemaker, you have the right to remain silent" the officer said as he put the handcuffs around my wrists. Soon his radio started making noise and it wasnt long before he reached out and more officers came to investigate the carnage. As they poured in, the rest of the sounds of nature returned, the birds, the insects, the rustling of the leaves.

As the officers began to walk me out of the woods I could see the shadowy creature follow me. He was always there everytime I turned my head watching me and every foot closer I got to leaving the woods the more clear his face became and as I reached the end of the woods, he was standing there watching me, smiling. It wasn't a happy smile, nor evil, but a tear came down his face as he watched me get in the car and as I looked out the window before we left I watched my old friend slowly fade away.

I regret my decisions, I took multiple alcohol classes and I have been sober for five years now. And even now I am in jail writing and working on a letter for the family of Justin. I can't fix what I did, no matter how much regret I have, I did the unimaginable and left a family in despair. I don't even know if he ever found peace with this confession, I can only pray that he is still not in those woods acting as some physical form of wrath and vengeance, either way, I am glad I am in here and not there. I also pray that nobody ever finds out whether or not Justin is truly gone. Last I swear I'll never go back into those woods again.
