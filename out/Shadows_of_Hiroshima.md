August 6, 1945, 8:10 AM. I was at my kitchen table, my pencil gliding on paper as I practiced my Kanji. My mother was in the kitchen, yawning away; the air raid sirens that blared throughout the night had kept us up. The scent of freshly cooked eggs hung delightfully in the air as a plate full of them was set before me. She gave my hair a quick ruffle before heading outside to the corner store down the road. I could feel the day's warm sun caressing my back with gentle heat. The birds sang outside, welcoming the new day. The cool outside breeze made its way inside through our open windows.



In that moment, a blinding white flash of light coated my surroundings, there was a deafening boom like I had never heard before, it was all encompassing yet seemed to come from so far away. I had begun to turn when a searing heat enveloped me. It was followed in quick succession by a crushing force that shattered every window at once and threw me across the room, knocking me unconscious.



When I awoke, the room was in a state of complete disarray. The table and chairs had been thrown around. Glass was strewn everywhere across the room. I couldn't move; my charred back was in excruciating pain. All I could smell was the stink of my own burnt flesh. I lay there wailing, calling out to my mother, but the world fell silent and no one answered my cries. I don’t know how long I lay there crying, not knowing what to do. As I got ready to stand and my back flexed, the slab of solid scorched flesh crunched and cracked, sending my entire body into a fit of agonizing pain.



I stood and made my way outside. I stumbled down our stone step to the paved road and started to make my way down the road. The asphalt clung to my every step. I hadn’t made it very far when I found her. She lay there on her knees in a ball, her arms wrapped around her head. She had been burned completely unrecognizable, a mass of charcoal, and the horrid smell clung to my nostrils, a smell that has never left me. I fell to my knees and held her charred remains, but no matter how hard I wailed and begged, tried to keep her together in my arms, her body turned to dust in my arms and was carried away by the wind.



My neighbours have been acting strangely ever since the bomb went off. I spent my days scrounging around the rubble searching for scraps of food, when one day I saw my neighbour. She was a kind elderly lady who’d always been courteous to me and my mother, but now, as I watched her sift through rubble, I couldn’t help but feel as though something was horribly wrong. Her skin was covered in splotchy red burns, her veins were blackened, and her hair dropped over her thin and wispy. I called out a welcome to her, and she snapped her head towards wild, rabid, bloodshot eyes stared into mine. She was hunched, growling savagely at me through clenched teeth. I backed away gently before turning away in a sprint. When I was far enough away, I turned to look in her direction. She was still hunched in the same place, her eyes were still locked onto me, and even from this distance, I could feel their burning anger.



Most nights, I sat outside on the side of the road where my mother had been. All that was left was a soot stain where she had once been. Some nights, I heard her wailing cries on the wind carried through the night air. One night, I had fallen asleep outside when I was woken up by a shrieking cry of fear. I stood at once examining my surroundings, when I saw her, it was my neighbour. She was viciously thrashing around in a field of rubble, screaming like a banshee. I would have thought her completely insane if it hadn't been for the deep slashes that appeared from thin air, littering her body. She was bleeding profusely, being cut into ribbons by something unseen. She collapsed finally, letting out a pained groan before fading away. At once, a flurry of rushing footsteps bolted towards me, a loud, primal, rage-filled growling was approaching coming from multiple sources in unison, and then I saw it on the ground, soot shadows gliding towards me, the last remains of the people of Hiroshima. I ran, but I was fast enough. I felt a sharp pain in my back. I staggered and fell to my knees. I was slashed again and again. I found my footing and bolted blindly. I ran like I never had before, the adrenaline carried my tired, hungry body until my lungs burned and I collapsed in the silent night.



 It's been a couple of days since that night, I don't go outside anymore, but I still heard them growling outside searching. My body is covered in red burns that are scattered across my entire body, my veins have become filled with a boiling black sludge that leaks from my wounds, I don't sleep anymore, all I can feel anymore is despair and a deep boiling rage.
