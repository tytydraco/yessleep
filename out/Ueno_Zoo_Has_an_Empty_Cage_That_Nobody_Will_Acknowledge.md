So I'm currently on my vacation in Japan, Tokyo specifically. Today we went to the Ueno Zoo, which is very nice as far as zoos go (no chance to see pandas though, the lines are crazy), but that's not the point.

We were wandering through small mammals building (or maybe that was nocturnal mammals building, there are two more or less similar buildings there), when I noticed an empty enclosure. Now it wouldn't be that weird, there's a number of those "exhibition closed temporarily for this or that reason" throughout the zoo, but what struck me were three things:

a) the enclosure being in one of the best positions inside the building: it sort of divides the route in two, so you walk by it twice, if it makes sense? Like that animal would be so cool you've got to see it twice

b) how empty it was. I mean all the other "temporarily closed" and "under maintenance" would usually have some hints about what animal was there originally, like some rocks, or a kennel, or branches, or whatever. Not here though, it was literally an empty concrete box with two glass walls. Nothing else.

c) the fact that it was probably meant for some nocturnal animal originally, so the inside of the cage was lit only with bleak yellow lamps, which somehow make everything look awash with a creepy shade of red.

Later I mentioned it to my wife and she paid no mind to it, giving a small chuckle and saying "yeah, I guess it's funny". My friend got weird though, starting to argue that he has perfect memory, liked small or nocturnal or whatever mammals building a lot, and remembers vividly there being no big empty enclosures in either of those. The argument got a bit too heated for my liking, and since we were near the tourist information office, I asked the lady to affirm there was indeed an empty cage there.

To my great suprise and frustration, she said no. No, there weren't an empty enclosure of any kind in either building.

I was extremely confused, shellshocked even, walking away with everyone, but when exiting the zoo I remembered something. I was so amused by the slightlhy absurd image of the empty cage proudly standing in the middle of the exhibition that I took a photo on my phone and quickly forgot about it.

So I showed the photo to my friend, and I swear it got weirder. He blanked out for like five seconds, staring at my phone. I started to get a little worried, when he unfroze and was like "yeah... right, there was one, I also thought it was a bit zany that they'd keep such a big enclosure empty...

Victorious albeit slightly weirded out, I let them drag me further on our route.

Now here it gets downright creepy. When I mentioned it at dinner, both my friends and my wife said there was no empty cage in the zoo, they would remember it and all that jazz. This time I didn't show them the photo, because it starts to really get on my nerves.

What the hell do I do? I feel like someone is losing it, and since three people having the same delusion feels less likely than one person going bonkers, it's probably me? I'm thinking about visiting the zoo tomorrow once again, although nobody wants to go with me, like "we visited once, there's nothing else to see".
