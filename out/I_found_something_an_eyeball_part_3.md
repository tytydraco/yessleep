I tried getting some sleep, I really did, all I ended up doing though was tossing and turning for a few hours, my mind keeps going at full speed, thoughts jumbled into a mess, the code, I have to get a chip reader that can read these roms, I’m taking a gamble on one that I found online, just a generic one from china, it didn’t list the roms in their comparability list but it did say that they’re compatible with most EPROMS, it really doesn’t help either that the internet has gotten really really slow these last couple of days.

I had an idea that a good long walk maybe could clear my mind, or at least make my body tired enough to make me fall asleep, god knows that at least my eyes are really tired, every single time I blink it feels like someone has rubbed sand in them, but my body other than that feels like it is on constant high alert, like I have drank 3 pots of coffee in a row. 

So on that walk… I am not sure if I saw something or if my mind is just playing tricks on me, but I headed out to a nearby Forrest, I just can’t stand the noise of the city so I do live a bit out but not far enough that it would take very long to get back to the city to get groceries and supplies, I keep getting distracted though, I did take that walk, there is a nice trail I like to use when I need some exercise but some areas are pretty badly maintained, trees and branches keeps growing out into the trail and I had to duck under one of those branches, and while doing that I did notice something that I hadn’t paid any attention to…. It’s still dark outside, it should be early morning by now, the sun should be going up, and while staring up at the sky noticing all this, there was a sudden smell, unusual smell, I can’t really describe it more than a little bit plastic-ish ? And a sharp sting in my eyes which made me blink pretty hard, and when I opened my eyes again I saw something swaying in the wind in the trees, it was a noose, just hanging there in the wind, I blinked again and it was gone.

I have no idea if that really happened or not, but I suddenly just didn’t feel safe there, so I decided to take the rest of the trail in a short sprint and to go back home again, I didn’t know what else to do..

I rushed back inside and closed and locked the front door with a slam, I peered over to my dedicated area where I work on old computers, and I must’ve forgotten to turn off the commodore because it was on, and I could see the screen with the text editor still on there, but there was something really odd, there was only two words on the screen which freaked me out like crazy, it only said “Keep reading” in a light blue font, I moved closer to it, but even after blinking several times and making sure that what I saw was real, it was still there, only after I heard a small buzzing sound and an electric spark, the machine rebooted and the text editor was back to “normal” again, I am not about to argue with a machine that seems to have a mind of its own at times, not until the reader gets here anyway.. so if I can’t fall asleep, walking had no effect and I have to wait on a package, I guess I am going to have to continue to read the logs in the meantime.

When I came to again the hallway was looking like it always had, a light floral pattern on otherwise boring gray color, in other words no bleeding, that is kind of funny in a way, a part of me liked the way it looked, but another part of me was terrified. I got up from the floor, my entire body feeling like it was made out of lead and felt very weak, I stumbled into the kitchen to check the fridge if I had something, anything to eat or drink, my mother has always told me that I needed that if I ever felt weak or sick, even if I don’t feel hungry or thirsty…

My kitchen was kind of an odd shape, you had to go around the dining table in order to reach the fridge, I had just accepted that since the wooden table was so big and I had no clue how to get it out of there, more than using an axe or something to turn it into toothpicks, when I managed to reach the fridge and open it, all I immediately saw in there was a plate with a very moldy ham and cheese sandwich which I had saved…. Yesterday !? how the hell can it be moldy already ? Was I passed out in the corridor for longer than I thought ?

I did find a bottle of water as well, you can very conveniently just put stuff on the table from the fridge without stretching yourself too far, which I’m glad for, but I did decide on throwing the sandwich away since it wouldn’t serve any purpose, it was way too far gone, so I took it and headed over to the sink where I keep the trash can in a cabinet under the sink, that’s when I saw it, an eyeball, right there in the drain, I am not entirely sure why, but I picked it up.

The green eye color was fascinating, almost hypnotizing, it looked like it glowed, an intense glow, it felt like it was staring right into my soul, in an almost mocking way, that irritated me a bit so I just instinctively squished it in my hand and wiped it off on the sandwich before I threw it in the trash.

I was starting to get hungry though, so I did try to pick up the phone to call for a pizza, but the phone line was completely dead, damn those unreliable landlines, they’re always working on them outside, it’s actually quite annoying with their drilling and their digging, I should…. No… I shouldn’t….

The bad thoughts are getting more tempting though, but when I went to exit the kitchen I accidentally bumped into the table, which immediately sent that electric shock through my body again and triggered another vision or flashback, this time more clear, it almost felt like I could control it to a degree though.

I saw a man on the table, approximately 2 meters tall, short black hair, glowing green eyes, they were wide open with fear, he had a very big green dishrag stuffed in his mouth it had been discolored though since red was seeping through it and it started pooling on the floor, it must’ve tasted awful, I (or whatever I am In this vision) stared at him for a moment, almost feeling hypnotized by the view, oh, I forgot to mention, he was strapped down to the table with a few layers of plastic wrap, it was only his hands that wasn’t strapped down in that manner, because they were held tight by the end of the table where one of those meat slicers where sitting, you know one of those that can slice ham really really thinly.

My hands pushing his fingers right into the slicer, they didn’t get very far though since it’s not meant to cut bone, but one finger at a time and very slowly it sure made him feel all the pain.. he did struggle a lot though he was crying and I could almost hear some muffled screaming, so much so that the blood from his cuts started to pump furiously, but his attempts at breaking free was very useless, I am much stronger than him and I needed him to feel as much pain as humanly possible, so I took out a flambé torch and melted some cheddar cheese on what remained of his fingertips so that I could cauterize the wounds nicely, next I needed to put large long needles in the middle of his stomach, oh how it must’ve hurt, I made sure to take it nice and slow as I needed to push them in until a clear-ish liquid came out of them which I collected in a bucket.

one of my favorite marinades is a mix of garlic, ketchup and loads and loads of chili powder, and I always have some prepared just in case there is a BBQ event that some of my friends are going to.

The guy did have very nice and muscular legs though, so it would be a shame to let them go to waste, but we really needed to prepare them first, so what I did was to bring out a really sharp butcher knife and started to cut off the skin from the back of his thighs, folding away the skin. We really needed to marinate the meat, so I brought out some of my favorite and started pouring it in, the twitching of the muscles mixed with the marinade and the crimson liquid floating around under what would’ve been skin looked so mesmerizing, but I also needed to leave a message, a very clear message, so while his leg meat was marinating nicely, I went over to the kitchen drawer and grabbed a spoon. Now this is the first time in my visions that I have actually heard some sound, and that sound was my own voice saying “this is really going to hurt, a lot” but in an almost synthesized voice, and with a spoon I’m my hand, I think you all know what’s going to happen next.

I pushed open one of his eyelids and started pushing the spoon in on top of his eye, and yanked it out of there, I then picked it up between my fingers and put it in the sink, right in the drain, I put away the spoon and picked up a filleting knife and shoved it right into his other eye, I guess I went to deep because I heard some crunching and he stopped trying to fight..

Next thing I know I woke up here by the computer again so I wrote all this down while I still have some sanity left, it feels like it’s slipping away though….

The walls are starting to bleed again… but now, I feel nothing from it….

And that’s where the log seems to end at least for now, as I’ve concluded, this machine seems to have a mind of its own, I  mean this guy in the logs… is he even real ? or is it just a program ? I did take a closer look at the motherboard though and through some googling, which took way longer than it should’ve, it seems like the machine was made in 1983, Because of the placement of the Vic-|| and the SID. I don’t know if there is any significance in that year though. But I have a feeling in my gut that it does… I have another feeling I should look in to the connection to Atari as well, there just has to be something.

I am going to try to go get some actual sleep now, I will update you guys when I find more information, or if something happens.
