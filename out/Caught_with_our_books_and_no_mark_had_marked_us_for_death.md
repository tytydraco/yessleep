I am sitting at the Greyhound station off Route 66 in downtown. The place smells like piss and diesel, a sanctuary for ghosts and lost causes. The vending machines hum with half broken neon, spitting light across gum stained tiles. I take one deep breath to center myself and then let it out slow. My palms rest heavy on my knees. I taste the iron of every mile that led me here.

A man across the room buys a bag of chips. His wrist flares red when the scanner reads his mark. He smiles as if the salt and oil are holy communion. A woman with her child steps up behind him, her scanner flashing yellow. Not enough devotion logged this week. The machine denies her. The boy cries but no one moves. I look away. The world decided her worth already.

I am in the business of truth. Not for truthâ€™s sake. Truth does not pay rent. I deal in truth because every side of a story deserves to be heard before the world burns down. Business has been good lately. End times have a way of making customers desperate.

As the clock ticks closer to midnight there is a war chewing through the seams of reality. Most do not see it. I do. And I can tell you things are not looking good for our side.

Last week the leaders rolled out a new economy. Not money anymore. Love. Not the warm kind either. Love for the system. If you want to buy or sell you need a mark. There are three flavors. Basic. Better. Best. Your rank decides if you eat steak or scrape rats. No mark means no food. No life. People trade betrayal for upgrades. A neighbor turning in a friend might earn a better mark. Parents selling out their children sometimes get the best. Devotion scored and calculated in cruelty.

For three years now my brothers and sisters of The Way have clawed our way through every plague and quake. Twelve percent of the world blinked out overnight. Empty cars rolled down highways with no drivers. Houses full of dinner plates cooling beside overturned chairs. The ground shook so often it felt stranger when it did not. Walls split open like old scars. Then the oceans coughed up their dead. Beaches black with rot. Fish by the millions washed ashore. Gulls fed and dropped dead beside the feast. The air was so thick with decay it burned the throat.

Yesterday they started the raids. Hunting the unmarked. Sirens screaming through the night as neighbors dragged neighbors into the street. Gallows rising in every town square like carnival rides. Kids with balloons pointing at them, laughing, not knowing what they were built to hold. Families cheered as the ads rolled out. Special four-body gallows. Buy tickets early. Guaranteed seats for the drop.

My crew was not caught for being unmarked. No. Our crime was worse. We were caught with our books of truth. The raid came at night. Doors kicked in. Boots on backs. We tried to run but someone betrayed us. The guards with the best marks laughed as they beat us bloody. Their marks glowed like trophies on their wrists. Some of my brothers never made it to the cells. The asphalt kept them.

I am the oldest. I am the calmest too. I reminded the rest this was written to happen. I led them in song. My voice cracked but it held. A hymn older than memory. Voices ragged with bruises but louder with every verse. The sound filled the cell. I told them the fire inside me burns in them too. That it cannot be killed. Flesh is temporary. Souls fight eternal.

I watched four of my brothers climb the gallows. They did not flinch. When the executioner opened the door under their feet the sky split open like a wound. The clouds tore apart. A light bled through so fierce it made the steel tremble. The sound was not thunder. It was deeper. A roar shaking marrow and dust alike.

My brothers and sisters bowed their heads to our Savior. The marked ones bowed too. Not out of reverence. Out of raw terror. Some clawed at their marks, trying to rip them off their flesh. Others fainted where they stood. Mothers covered the eyes of their children but still they shook. Because in that moment every last one of them knew.

Their marks would not save them. Their system was dust.

We had been beaten. We had been starved. We had been mocked. But in that moment we were not broken. We bowed in hope. They bowed in fear. And that was the day the faithful of The Way knew the war was already won.
