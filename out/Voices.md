The voices are getting louder.  They have been there for my whole life, talking to me, keeping me company, offering me comfort and advice.  They have been incredibly helpful. They gave me words to speak when I just couldn’t find the right ones.  They have given me answers to questions that I couldn’t figure out on my own.  And they . . .how do I put this?  They . . . tell me things that nobody should know.

I’m not psychic at all. I have no idea what the voices are or where they come from. What I do know is that if they tell me to cross the street right now, I do. I have. In fact, it was just in time to get out of the way of a couple of gang members shooting at each other through a crowd of pedestrians. A lot of people got hurt. Some died. Not me though. The same goes for when they told me not to get into the cab that first responded to my hail. Turns out that driver was looking to get revenge on the world before going out in a blaze of glory. He picked up four fares that day and killed every one of them before getting into a shootout with the police. He was killed. As for me? I would have been his third fare.

I think that’s enough to give you an idea of my relationship to the voices in my head. I don’t think you want to sit though some long, drawn out story about the financial decisions they guided me on, or the relationship decisions, or the career decisions, the scratchers to buy, or the deep secrets that no one should know and I often wish that I did not.

Let’s jump into my present situation.

The voices have never told me to kill anyone before. I don’t know why they want me to do it now. I don’t even know who the person is. Well, I didn’t know. The voices have told me everything there is to know about him. I know his name. I know where he lives. I know exactly what he looks like, his schedule, the name of his goldfish, his favorite food, the shows he watches. Heck, I even know that he rubs one out every night before bed. I really didn’t need to know that.

I’ll call him Glenn. Not his real name, but I don’t think that using his real name would be a very good idea. He lives two states over in a smallish town. Nice house. Paid for it with the life insurance money from his wife that he murdered. Me made it look like an accident. Used some meth cooking methods to extract the epinephrine from a bunch of decongestants and injected it all into her while she slept. It gave her a massive heart attack. He jabbed her in the armpit, where it’s super easy for the coroner to miss a tiny needle mark. No one ever suspected a thing.

But I know.  I know because the voices know.

Oh, he hated her so much. What began as a marriage of love became a marriage of convenience that became a marriage trap. They fought all the time for years. Their hatred for each other grew by the day until one day he snapped. No, that’s not the day he killed her, but it is the day he decided to. He’s smart. He knows that the first suspect in any suspicious death is the husband, especially when he is always fighting with his wife. That’s why He stopped fighting with her and went out of his way to be super good to her.

I know what you’re thinking. That’s the near-universal cure for a bad marriage. It makes a woman fall in love all over again and makes her putty in her hubby’s hands. You’re absolutely right about that. Even if it starts as a sham, you would think that the way the wife responds to the husband would soften his heart and the love would blossom between them. It wasn’t that way for him. His hatred was too deep. His resolve was too firm. All he cared about, all he wanted, was the illusion of being a loving husband so that he wouldn’t fall under suspicion.

He invested two whole years into his plan. She was so happy. All the while he was slowly obtaining the meds, making it a habit to go hiking or hunting in the woods so his final trip, the one where he would create his poison, wouldn’t look suspicious.

She never saw it coming. He injected her. He watched her die. Then he got in bed with her and went to sleep. When he woke up, he pretended to panic. He called 911 with fake tears and choking in his voice. When the paramedics declared her dead and carted her away, he broke down in a flood of crocodile tears. When the police took his statement, he wailed and cried that he loved her with all of his heart.

He went through all the right motions, playing the part of the grieving husband to perfection whenever there was anyone to see him. In private he reveled in his newfound freedom, loving the peace and the lifting of the burden of treating the woman he hated like a queen.

That’s the short version of his story. Of course, no one on earth knows this but him, the voices, me, and now you do too. He never told anyone. I have no way to know this. It’s the voices.

I don’t like the idea of offing a man based only on what the voices tell me, but they voices have literally never been wrong. Never. Been. Wrong. Not even once. But this is a whole new level of demand from them. This isn’t life advice or protecting me from harm. This is murder. Or maybe it’s justice. If he really did murder his wife killing him would be justice, wouldn’t it? The cops can’t do anything. There’s literally no evidence of foul play. He had her body cremated, so they couldn’t exhume her and test her for an epinephrine overdose based on an anonymous tip. Everything he used in the murder, what little there was, was destroyed long ago. There is literally no way for the law to serve him with a big helping of justice unless he confesses to the murder. 

He will never do that. His conscience doesn’t bother him in the least. He thinks it’s the best thing he ever did.

No one will ever believe me either. They have no reason to. I have no evidence but the voices in my head. That’s the kind of evidence that gets you locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane. It’s the kind of evidence that guarantees that you will be kept a drugged up, drooling mess in a straitjacket and a padded room.

I have been telling the voices no. I can’t do it. Justice or not, it’s still me taking another human life without the support of the law. I can’t be judge, jury, and executioner.

They tell me that they are the judge and jury, and I am merely the executioner.

I have never had any reason to doubt the voices in my life. I doubt them now. I doubt them because killing is wrong. But then again, he’s a killer, isn’t he? Is he really going to just get away with it and live a long and happy life? Could I live with myself if I do what the voices tell me to do?

I need to stop. Maybe take a sleeping pill. The voices are screaming at me. It’s so loud. It hurts. It hurts my head. It hurts my ears. It hurts my eyes and even my body. They are so loud. I don’t think they will stop unless I do what they say. I don’t know what to do. Do I trust them like I always have in the past? Do I do what they say whether I trust them in this or not? Do I continue to resist?

Help me. Please. I don’t know. I just don’t know.
