Voices

 Unknown voice. Oh I need it, I need them..I’ll do anything to have them. 

Voice 1. No! You know you can’t it’s against the rules you’ll get into so much trouble! 

Voice 2. Oh what’s a little fun, can’t you see they’re suffering..come on give into it have a little fun you know you want to. 

Voice 3. No they’re right I can’t I have to just keep looking away. I love them so much they’re so beautiful and just look at the way they walk, the way the sound, oh I can smell them…

Voice 1. Please stop!! You can’t it’s not right and that’s not who you are. 

Voice 2. Oh but did you have anything to say when they went found the one that looks like them? Come on you stood right by when we got them and you didn’t say a thing when we had fun huh? 

Voice 1. That’s different! It wasn’t them nobody knew who they were, we checked they didn’t have any family, they had no one. 

Voice 3. They had me! You’re right I can’t and I don’t hurt them I would never hurt them. I make sure I get them to the hospital afterwards. I love them and I know they love me right? 

Voice 2. Of course they do..but aren’t you tired of not having the real thing? Imagine the touch; the taste; the feel. Oh god it’s so intoxicating I can feel how much you’re trembling at the idea of having them. Go on do it you can’t fight the hunger anymore remember how good it felt when you climaxed? 

Voice 3. I know but I can’t I’ll get into so much trouble, I feel so drunk with the idea of having them I crave them, I must have them…

Voice 1. Please don’t you know you can’t you fought the hunger for so long, at first it was innocent just a crush but then you started to follow them, you stalk them, you’ve almost ruined their marriage. Please just stop. 

Voice 3. But I’m no one, I’m a fly on the wall nobody has figured out it’s me I’m very careful, oh god I’m salivating now..that’s it now’s the chance I’m doing it. 

Voice 2. Good. Remember no one will ever expect it’s you call them you want it and you’ll have it all you have to do is pickup the phone. I’ll handle the other one. 

Voice 1. Please no you can’t please for the love of god please don’t. As voice 1 is speaking their voice fades away.

Voice 2. They’re now gone and just me and you. So how about we have some fun. Oh god I’m about to hit a climax like no other, they thought they could run, they thought they could use their marriage and family as an excuse now they’re ours. 

Voice 3. Yes, now they will belong to us. I’ll place the call now. 

(Voice 3 on the phone.
