Hi, my name’s Eddie, I just recently get back at home, not my old house, but a new one in a new city, has been a while since the incident, I spend 3... 4 months? I don’t know, when you’re trapped in a room being “rehabilated” is easy to lose track at time, but it looks I’m fine so far, so they let me go and yet, I feel like I need to tell someone about what happened, the doctor all listened to me, but I felt more like a subject more than a pacient, so if you’re reading this. Please, never, NEVER, get close to the white chair in the forest.

All of this happened last year, in december, me and my friends decided to spend the whole weekend camping, we’re very usual to the wild life, our entire childhood was about hunting and playing hide-and-seek between the trees and rocks. Of couse our parents never like it when we get too far from home or from their view of us, but still, we keep doing it and thankfully nothing bad happened to us, something really bad that’s what I mean. We hurted ourselves by running, falling, but we never happened to break a bone or injuries, and a friend of ours, who I gonna call by Elliot, was about to get married and we decided to celebrate his Bachelor party by doing the thing we liked the most and to remind how much we change since we were kids, it was unanimously, the idea was given from other friend of mine, who I gonna call by Martin, we were a group of six, and I was the younger among them, the older one was Martin himself he was 27, so by decrease order, we got Chuck and Lucas they were 26, Tommy who was 25, the man who was being honored, Elliot, 24 and finally me, 23.

We had everything planned, Lucas made sure of that, he was the brain of the group, but don’t fool yourself thinking he was some skinny nerd, in true, he was, but after some bully, he hitted the gym and he changed a lot since them, he got more confindent about himself and wasn’t afraid to talk to us about being gay, he was a good guy, but God forbid us if we didn’t everything as he said, we would suffer the entire travel hearing him screaming about how we didn’t change and still being selfish and stubborn kids without a care in world, but luckily this didn’t happen, we bought every tin food as he requested and the water bottles, beers, sodas and some marshmallows, wouldn’t be so much, because we only planned to spend the entire saturday and by the afternoon of sunday to get our shit together and get back at home, simple as that, I mean, it would be if wasn’t by Michael trying to convice us to not get back at that forest.
