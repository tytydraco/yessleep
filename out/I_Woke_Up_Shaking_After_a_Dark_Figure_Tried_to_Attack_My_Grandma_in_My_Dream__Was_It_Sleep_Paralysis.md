ou won’t believe what happened to me the other night. It’s undoubtedly one of the most unsettling experiences I’ve ever had, and even now, it feels like a shadow I can’t shake off. Here’s what happened:

I was in bed, deeply asleep and wrapped in two blankets, feeling cozy and unaware of anything around me. But then, in the middle of the night, I had a dream.

In this dream, I found myself standing in the hallway of my house. It was strangely elongated, far darker than usual, and the air felt thick, as if something was pressing down on me. At the end of the hallway stood my grandmother, her back to me. She was completely still, almost like a lifeless shell, and I felt an overwhelming sense of dread.

Then, I noticed it—the dark figure.

It wasn’t just a shadow; it was something much more real, almost human but off in every way. Its presence was heavy, ominous, and exuded a palpable sense of malevolence. The figure began moving toward my grandmother, and panic surged through me. I tried to shout, to warn her, to run and stop it, but I couldn’t. My voice was gone, my body was frozen. I couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything. The helplessness was suffocating, and the closer the figure got to her, the stronger the fear became.

Just as it seemed like it would reach her, I woke up—or at least, I thought I did.

My eyes snapped open, and I found myself in my bed, but everything felt wrong. My body was trembling violently, shaking uncontrollably, as though something was ripping through me. It wasn’t just the usual fear-induced tremors; it was something far deeper, like I was vibrating from the inside out. Despite being under two blankets, I was freezing cold, as if I’d been dropped into the Arctic.

The worst part? I couldn’t move. I was wide awake, fully aware of my surroundings, but my muscles refused to respond. I tried to move, to shift even a finger, but nothing happened. I was trapped, fully conscious, unable to do anything as the shaking continued for what felt like an eternity. Each second dragged on, and the coldness seemed to seep deeper into my bones.

Finally, after what felt like ten agonizing minutes, the shaking stopped. My body slowly regained control, and I could move again, but I felt utterly drained, both physically and mentally. I sat there, confused and disoriented, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The sensation of that dark figure, its malevolent presence, lingered in the room, as if it had left an imprint on the very air around me.

I still don’t know what to make of it. Was it sleep paralysis? A nightmare so vivid that it bled into reality? Or was it something else entirely? Whatever it was, it didn’t feel like a simple dream. It felt real—too real. That dark figure, its intentions clear and terrifying, remains etched in my mind, and I can’t help but feel like it’s still watching, waiting, just beyond the edge of my vision.
