I travelled from london to Osaka in November.Japan would be a breath of fresh air I had thought 
But it gave me more trouble than anything. I was supposed to be traveling from osaka to Kyoto but the train was late

Meishin expressway,I might have heard its name in a movie before but couldn't remember as I sat there absorbed in my thoughts a man sat down next to me He appeared to be American.

He wasn't old perhaps in his mid thirties .his face framed by a mop of dark messy hair.his eyes were odd scanning the surroundings as if expecting something 
 
He glanced at my camera then at me 
Are you also here to test the legend he asked a knowing smile spread over his face

I raised my eyebrow confused not knowing what the dude was talking about.he was expecting an answer on something I had no clue about  
I took my shot figuring talking was better than waiting 

What legend I asked him.you know the one about teke-teke he responded.teke teke what sort of name was that I couldn't help my self from laughing the man frowned but continued

The legend about the girl who drags her upper body using her arms some say that she haunts this very station.What happened to her I asked not scared more or less amused

Her fellow students played a prank on her they put a cicada in her she started screaming and panicking she fell on the tracks 
And a train ran over her 

But she got her revenge one night after a party the boys were returning home when they heard the sound of cicadas. They ended up meeting the same fate as her

I dont know why but I suddenly felt a chill .what happens to those who make fun of her I asked
Now paying full attention 
The man turned to me making me wish I had not asked the question 
Make fun of her ,question her story or not believe it it's your choice 

But it's also her choice on whether she hears you or not when you beg for mercy she may just show up to prove her story is real

I looked around the station there were only 4 or 5 other people 
What do you have to do to survive I mumbled my breaths now narrower


So how do I survive I asked him
He turned to me with a sad smile you will hear a dragging sound you better start running when you hear it the first time.by the time you finally realize it is real she may be close she is unrealistically fast she may also ask the question where are my legs you must respond with at meishin expressway 

I went to the washroom for a minute and started splashing water on my face the story had messed me up.Okay so I was being a bag of shit who was not respecting a local legend but why did I suddenly believe in it

I was snapped out of my thoughts by a voice all passengers please board the train I ran back but the train had left then I heard it "scrape scrape"something was dragging on the concrete 

Without thinking I started running different platforms whizzed by
But the scrapping sound was always in my ears my camera was banging against my chest.just then I fell over

She dragged herself toward me her torso unnaturally twisted skin pale and stretched over bones.her legs were gone severed at the thighs.her arms unnervingly strong scraped the ground as she moved
Leaving streaks of crimson behind

Her face was contorted into rage her eyes were wide and hollow.her lips cracked into a twisted grin
Her mouth let out silent sobs a smell of decay filled the platform

Her eyes were locked onto mine and asked :
Where...are my....legs? Her voice was soft at first,barely a whisper,but they carried a weight that made my blood run cold

Her gaze never wavered as she stepped closer to me.I could hear the breathing,the gagging that sounded almost human yet so wrong
Her head slowly tilted to the side
As if waiting for an answer 

She moved closer and asked again this time more vengeful more desperate this was my last chance to answer 

Where....are my....legs.i  gasped for air and my voice above a whisper answered at the meishin expressway there was a sound of scrapping. Had I defeated her

When I opened my eyes her face was in front of me staring at me as if saying we will meet again before disappearing 

I didn't stick around and ran all the way back to my hotel room I am currently booking my flight back to London there is no need for me to stick around 

Before I go I should warn you all never to make fun of spirits big or small,malevolent or benevolent,helpful or dangerous they might decide to have a little fun of their own
