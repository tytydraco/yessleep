They say death smiles at us all, sometimes all we can do is smile back. I feel comfortable telling this story now, as with the passage of time this feels like a long forgotten dream. I grew up in a small town in North-West Canada, far beyond the quaint summer towns of the Gold Coast. A place much closer to  Earth's last frontier, a land where nature and brutality still coincide. 

Our small town had little more than a school, store and police station. If any of the local loggers were injured on the job, it'd be an hour's helicopter ride to the nearest hospital. As far back as I can remember, we were warned to never stray from the main roads. Looking back on it now, this is perfectly understandable as the threat of grizzlies, cougars and even mankind was enough to dissuade any brave youngster from venturing too far off the beaten path. That was until Michael went missing.

There had long been stories that the woods were haunted. Tales of ancient creatures driven to one final refuge untouched by mankind. They said they lived down deep in the caves and caverns of the Canadian rockies, and only came out when their hunger could no longer be staved off. Michael was last seen on November 8th 1981 at the age of fourteen. A boy two years older than myself at the time. Even now I still remember his bright face running around the schoolyard. There were little more than 15 of us that made up the student population of that school. As a result we shared many classes together.

Michael had been missing for more than three days before a manhunt was announced. People from nearby towns would be coming to help out. Patrols were to begin as soon as possible of the surrounding areas. I recall our teacher telling us that school would be finishing early that day and our parents would be collecting us. Any and all help was to be accepted by the local search. I recall at the time telling my closest friend James that we had to be a part of it.

While I was sympathetic to a boy from my school going missing, I'll admit that my interest in the search was for far more selfish reasons. For years I had kept myself away from any of the forbidden areas of our town, however natural curiosity had long gotten the better of me. I jumped at the chance to volunteer for Michael's search party. I had to know what the forest looked like, the scent of the pinecones or sheer size of the massive evergreens that had for so long encircled me. I had to delve deeper.

Surprisingly, given myself and James' proximity to Michael in school, he and I were assigned to a local deputy to provide insight and aid in the search. I guess they thought we could more easily recognise any of Michael's personal belongings. Armed with little more than a head-torch and a whistle, the three of us set out to cover an area of terrain that lead deeper into the forest than I had ever ventured. 

The first thing I remember feeling was the cold. Anyone familiar with the Pacific Northwest knows that in areas of abundant darkness, like dense forest, life is unlikely to thrive. The forest floor was covered in nothing but rock, pinecones and needles... particularly difficult to gain your footing on in the dark. The behaviour of the deputy, while chipper and accommodating to his younger guests, was not one of confident expertise. We spent hours combing the forest floor with nothing to show for it, until finally we came to the entrance of a cave. Just below the mouth we saw it, a small red glove that could be none other than Michael's itself. Any feeling of adventure I previously had left me in one breath, now only fear remained.

The deputy noted fresh tracks leading into it. He unholstered his bear spray and told us he was going to take a quick look inside and to stay put for a moment. We watched him enter, his silhouette quickly being engulfed in nothing but abject darkness. We were alone. Myself and James shared worried looks, reassuring each other that the deputy would be back at any moment. Ten minutes turned into thirty and thirty minutes became an hour. We were going to have to search the cave to find him.

Entering the cave was an assault on the senses. Not only could we barely see with our now low on battery head-torches, but the stench was unlike anything I had ever encountered. I recall James and I faintly hearing a strange sound. "Deputy?" we shouted into the abyss. 

We found Michael's body before long. What remained was little more than a pile of fabric and bone. James began to scream while I froze in horror, too stunned to run. I recall being knocked off of my feet. Suddenly losing my balance and vision when my head hit off the rocky floor. My last memory of James, hearing a loud crunch while his screams were cut short. 

It was the sound that woke me. Animalistic gnashing, tearing, gulping echoed across the damp cave walls. I remember scrambling across the floor searching for my head-torch. It's low orange light illuminating the wall of the cave. I placed it on my head and turning, I saw it. Crawling slowly from the far side of the cave, a creature unlike any I'd ever seen before or since. It's face made up of pale white skin stretched tight across an inhuman skull, so tight that the skin pulled above it's teeth into a permanent smile. Blood dripped from it's putrid mouth as it's eyes, black as coal, sized me up. 

I was lucky. It was already fatigued from it's attack on the deputy and James. It curiously advanced towards me grinning it's sickening grin. Thinking back now I have no idea why I did it but slowly I began to bar my teeth. Showing my upper canines, peeling my own lips upwards, I smiled at the creature. It came closer and closer until we were eye to eye. Smelling my best friend on it's breath, behind tears in my eyes, I smiled harder, gritting my teeth to the point I thought they might break. The last feature I recall of the beast were it's eyes deep and dark, not of my world, as though there was an entire universe housed within them. In an instant the creature leapt away from me, back to it's feast. I ran.

It was daybreak by the time I exited the cave. I ran until my legs could take me no further and then I crawled. I crawled until I no longer felt the sting of pine on my knees but concrete. They found me passed out in the middle of a road leading into our town. I was filthy and covered in blood and bones. Based on what I told the police, the bodies of James, Michael and the deputy were found. The entire incident chalked up to a savage bear.  I spoke nothing of what I saw in that cave, who would believe me if I did? Two young boys entered that cave, neither ever truly left. I haven't smiled since.
