# Experiment #69

# Subject : A mass of people

# Operation - Started

&#x200B;

I watched through my screens, observing.

This was my first time here. I was unemployed, looking for a job and suddenly, Colamdemo Pharmaceuticals took a real interest in me.

I was surprised at first, by the email. But, the interview was nice. I was offered the position of 'supervision', though of what, was never really told.

But I didn't care. The pay was good, job seemed easy, life was good.

Until it really wasn't. Until it was really impeccably fucked from all sides.

You know, the worst kind of fear, is fear of the unknown. And the most unknow thing of all in our human life, is death.

Of everything that happens in our life, every decision that we take, we have certain knowing of how it will turn out. We at least are able to feel sure, that we know what will happen.

But what about death? Can you ever know what happens after it? Sure, there are all theories there. But at the slightest possibility of you dying, you forget all logic.

And that is what Colamdemo Pharmaceuticals wanted to test.

What happens, when you are given a certain guarantee that you are going to die? And can you calm down this type of fear?

Of course, they told me, that no one was actually going to die. It was just a social experiment. Though it was still a bit illegal. But . . . what was the harm?

They said they wanted to test their new 'panic calming' medicine and this was the perfect set up.

So, on the people of village of Churog, the operation started. Even I don't know where that is.

So, from the hidden speakers, an announcement was made:

**DEATH SHALL COMMENCE IN:**

**100**

10 second pause

**99**

5 second pause

**98**

15 second pause

&#x200B;

The timing was a bit irregular, on purpose.

As expected, signs of mass hysteria started to occur.

*"Hey! What the fuck is happening?"*  
*"I don't know man. Where is the sound coming from?"*

They were being a little calm, but it was expected at first.

&#x200B;

**95**

**94**

**93**

&#x200B;

All the villagers were now gathering up, discussing.

*"Is this some kind of your prank, John? If it is, I will fucking---"*  
*"Hell naw man! Do you think I do pranks of 'Death commences in?' Hell no"*  
*"Then what the fuck is happening?"*

Suddenly, the counting fastened up

&#x200B;

**89**  
**87**  
**86**

&#x200B;

*"Oh my fucking god, what the fuck is even happening? Are there like speakers or some shit somewhere?"*  
*"Hey guys, you know what? Let's calm the fuck down. It's just a countdown, ok? Like what can even happen? Has somebody really died yet? Fuck this shit!"*  
*"Though we appreciate your message, Sam, it would be better if you did not swore in front of the kids. You are new here and everyone would like if you maintained a bit of decency."*

Really? They were caring about decency in a possible 'you-are-going-to-fucking-die-right-now' situation.

Sam was actually one of our actors. He was supposed to die now, showing that anyone who dared oppose this cosmic force would be eliminated right now.

He was going to 'die' with a heart attack and with a drug designed by our company, Ivadentine. It slows your heart rate so much, it would seem like you're dead.

So, I was watching through the surveillance cameras. The company had made this amazing infrastructure so stealthy, no one was able to notice it. And I watched Sam swallow the capsule which was fitted in his teeth.

I was waiting, amidst the countdown.

**79**

Pause

**78**

Pause

*"Why doesn't it stop man?"*  
*"Listen guys, calm. let's stay here, with everyone, till it stops. Being together may help us."*  
*"He is right"*

**71**

**70**

# FIRST DEATH : COMMENCING

I was excited to see the acting of Sam, possibly laugh at it.

**Then his fucking torso exploded.**

All of his ribs, his muscles, spinal cord, parts of his heart, parts of his lungs, his stomach, small and large intestine and every fucking body part you can label, was out there, splattered and spread on the people.

And blood. Lots of blood was there.

For 10 complete seconds there was silence. In the village and in my closed cubicle.

And then it was heard

**69**

**68**

**67**

*"AAAAAAAA----"*  
*"FUCK!"*  
*"SHIT!"*  
*"OH MY GOD!"*

"What the fuck?!", I screamed out loud.

This was not the part of it. This was not supposed to be.

What in the actual hellhole of fuck?

As I tried to get up, immediately, my phone rang.

I was terrified as fuck and that ring startled me. With trembling hand, I picked up.

"What do you think you're doing? Sit down and observe. You are also required to give commands. If you even dare try to get out of here, you shall be terminated."

"I don't give two fucks about this job and its money. Fuck off."

"Oh, terminated did not mean fired, you prick. It meant termination from your useless life."

I sank down on my chair. I was fucked.

"Now sit down and do your work. Also, now that you know, the medicine, which you shall release, is for calming down, right? You shall only release it after we say so, though when you should after that, is upon you."

"Ok . . . sir."

And I continued watching. I had to.

Situation was getting drastic right now. People were scared, no no, hysterical. They were screaming, crying, praying.

The countdown had now reached 40.

**39**

**38**

**37**

And then it sped up. Like, it sped the fuck up.

**36 35 34 33 32 31 30 . .**

# You may now release the medicine 

The message popped up on my screen.

I immediately clicked enter. Finally, the horror would stop.

The medicine was supposed to be so effective, that even with a dead body, even a bomb in front of you, you would stay calm and still then, you would stay logical, not high, logical.

And that was the biggest mistake I ever did.

The horror didn't stop. It increased manifolds.

*"GUYS! SAM'S BODY IS MOVING!"*  
*"What? No!"*  
*"OH MY GOD! IT IS COMING AT ME! SHIT!"*

And with that, Alex was dead. I never knew what killed him. Maybe heart attack, maybe brain hemorrhage. That report is only with **them.** All that mattered, was that the drug was working.

Turns out, the drug wasn't 'panic-calming', it was 'panic-inducing'

And the things that were done by the people of village to each other, to the women, to the children. I had to witness them. I had to witness them all.

The countdown stopped long ago. But for them, it was still going on.

The blood, the bones, the screams, the crying of the innocent children.

In the end, there was a pop up on the screen.

# Operation - Successful.
