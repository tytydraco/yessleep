I don't even know when it started. One night i was trying to fall asleep and i felt a presence in the room. As i was laying down on my bed, my consciousness slowly fading away i felt it over me like a shadow. At first, i thought it was sleep paralyses. I had them before no problem. Just stay calm. But soon i realised that i could move my hands and my legs. It soon spoke to me with its sweet voice "Go back to sleep."

It was the first time it ever spoke to me. I in fact went back to sleep, wishing it was just a dream.

I woke up with my alarm ringing, filling the room with not the beeping sound itself, but with its echoes. Someting was wrong. The air was wrong the noises were wrong, the room...

I saw him in the empty corner of my room, a shadow with a humanoid shape. I jumped from my bed screaming but i couldnt hear my own voice.

An hour maybe half an hour or just a few minutes later i managed to move. "Its okay" i said out loud. "Im just imagining things." I left the room running and went to school. The whole day the only thing i could thing about was the shadow. I went out for a drink with friends because i was so scared to go home. I managed to convince one of my friends to come back to my apartment for some drinks. I let him in and told him to wait for me in my room. He went in. I did not hear a scream or anything. "It's okay" i thought to myself. "It was just my imagination". I grabbed two beers and opened the door. He was sitting in my bed. I immediatly turned my head to the corner. There it was. It looked even bigger now. A little redness coming out of where i imagined its eyes were. My friend, Alex wasn't seeing him no doubt. He was going through my dvd collection. I didn't ask him if he was seeing it too. There was no point.

I didn't go to my room for the next few days not even to pick up some clean clothes. But at night, i would hear things from the room. Nothing clear but just a sound, an echo, something that i wasn't supposed to hear.

Why is this happening to me?

I didn't do anything wrong.

No i didnt.

It was supposed to be a game.

I called them, you know. Called my friends. Jokingly talked about something following us through the stupid little ritual we did. They joked back. No, i know it was only my blood that we put into that doll. Only few drops. Now its in my house, in my room, in my head.

We were supposed to be able to talk the spirits, ghost through the doll but nothing happened. Not even a single knock from the wall. We burned the doll afterwards.

It was what that blog told us to do. To prevent the spirits, demons follow us back through it. We did it everything they said. No it can't be from that ritual.

I must be crazy.

I went back to the room after a week. It took me hours and a few bottle of beers to gather the courage but i did it. It was still there. I don't now what came over me but i started screaming, cursing at it. I screamed to it to give me a reason why it was here. It spoke to me, again told me to calm down. He told me "There is no reason to be afraid of me kid. Your time here is not done yet."

He said very little but i knew. I knew the truth, i could feel it to my bones. He was not going to kill me but claim me or use me after i was dead. I don't know what's awaiting me in the afterlife but i know it is not very plesant.

It has been 25 years since it last spoke to me. I am not that old but i have been diagnosed with lung cancer. It is bad. I am not responding to the treatment and i might die any minute. It knows that as well.

I moved couple of times but it has always claimed a corner in my bedroom. It has got much bigger now. I can almost see its mouth. I think its happy that the long waiting game is finally going to pay off. I am not going to try to fight  it, not anymore. I got some sleeping pills. I took the whole bottle. I can't think that well anymore. The words seem ... off. Anyway, I am welcoming it. I can almost feel it in my veins. There is no shadow in the corner anymore. The whole room is dark. He is in the every single atom in the room, in the oxygen i breathe.
