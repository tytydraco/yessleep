The boy beneath the bridge has an actual name, of course, but mentioning it might give away where this story takes place. And for your own safety, it’s best I avoid that. Those of you who know about this story though, will already know what I'm talking about. 

Back in the day, in a world without the internet or video games, people had to get a little creative to entertain themselves. If you were a student with a lot of time on your hands, it was especially easy to get bored. One of the more popular pastimes at one point were breath-holding contests. It was a simple game: whoever could hold their breath the longest won. It didn't require much either - just two people and a clock - but it was an easy way to pass the time.

One of these games went terribly wrong. 

A group of boys became a little too competitive and decided to have their breath-holding contest underwater, near the bridge. Unfortunately, one of them took it far too seriously and refused to surface, even as his lungs began to burn for a breath of fresh air.

At first, the other boys cheered, impressed by how long he kept his head submerged. But they soon realized something was wrong. When they pulled him out, they saw that he had passed out at some point. The boy did not survive, even after being rushed to the hospital. 

And while a boy did pass away during that time period with a matching name, it was from a completely unrelated incident. 

This story likely started out as just a cautionary tale that got terribly out of hand. But there is more to the story.

There's a game you can play: Go to that same bridge just after midnight. If you declare that you want to have a breath-holding contest and then successfully hold your breath underwater for at least three minutes, it is said that you will awaken the boy’s spirit which is still trapped beneath the shallow depths. 

All of this is just an urban legend, or so I thought. That is, until some of my buddies convinced me to try it when we were drunk one night. As you can imagine, nothing happened. At least, nothing happened at first.

You see, the legend goes a step further. Once you complete the challenge, you will begin to see the boy’s spirit in any body of water large enough to drown in. It could be a nearby lake, a river, or even your bathtub or sink if its deep enough. Once you see his reflection in the water, you have to hold your breath. Because for each breath you take, he can take one step closer to you, emerging from the water and into the real world. Once he latches onto you, there’s no escape. 

He’ll drag you down to a watery grave.

Again, I thought nothing of this until tonight.

I was house-sitting for some neighbors. I hadn't realized they had left their bathtub filled before leaving, likely having drawn it for a bath but then forgetting about it and also to drain it. 

When I went to drain it, I saw... *it* in the water. 

It wasn’t my reflection. It was the reflection of a mottled corpse, glaring at me. Needless to say, I took a deep breath. That was my first mistake. A head began to emerge from the water. I took another breath, and then another, gasping for air in shock as he emerged from the shallow depths.

At one point, he was only a hand’s breadth away from me, and I could smell the rot and decay laden in the air. 

Thankfully, my brain finally kicked in, and I held my breath as I backed away, barely avoiding his touch. He turned his head, his lifeless eyes still filled with hate from beyond the grave, though the rest of him remained motionless. 

If I didn't know any better, there was a mocking smile on his lips, as if saying, "How much longer can you hold your breath?"

I ran downstairs, holding my breath until I reached the front door. Naturally, the distance had winded me, and I ended up gasping for air as I heard footsteps echoing from upstairs. My lungs were burning, but I knew I couldn't give in and finally held my breath, the stench of decay having gotten closer. 

I fumbled with the lock, but the door refused to open. It was jammed. 

I just needed to put a little elbow grease into it, but that's hard to do when you're trying to hold your breath. I felt myself getting lightheaded as I made little progress. Should I risk the back door, or should I give some respite to my burning lungs and try forcing this open?

Ultimately, I chose to try the front door, taking a few desperate breaths as I put my shoulder into it, trying to pry it open. It remained unbudging. 

As my lungs greedily took in what they had been lacking, I heard his footsteps get louder and louder before they stopped as I paused. 

I turned around and saw that he had completely blocked the hallway. There was only the door behind me as a way out, which refused to open.

I’m sure there's more to the urban legend. I'm sure there's a way to get rid of him forever. Only, I don't know it. Before I started typing this out on my phone, he was at the end of the corridor leading to the front door. By now, he's already taken five steps, and I'm in no way closer to getting the front door open. 

I'm trying to hold out for as long as I can. 

But any help would be appreciated. And quickly.

I fee like my chest is about to explode...
