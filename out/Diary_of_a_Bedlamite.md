“Diary of a Bedlamite”

“Lamb for slaughter”

Ezra sat in his chair, fingers steepled, his gaze fixed on the door as he waited patiently for his client to arrive. The steady, unwavering rhythm of the clock filled the room. “Today is the day, I know all I need to.”

Tick, tock, tick, tock.

The seconds carried on, the silence hanging heavy and thick in the air, with nothing but the steady, unyielding tick-tock of the clock breaking through. Ezra's expression was impassive, betraying none of the determining thoughts that simmered beneath the surface.

Tick, tock, tick, tock.

The atmosphere in the room grew heavy and oppressive, as if the very space around them had become a living, responsive thing, brimming with anticipation for the meeting to come. Ezra's gaze glinted with a primal, ravenous hunger, his lips curling into a faint, grin.

Tick, tock, tick, tock.

The eerie silence was shattered by a soft, tentative knock that echoed through the dimly lit room like a gunshot. Ezra's eyes snapped open, his laser-like focus shattering as he was jolted back to the present moment. A muscle in his jaw twitched involuntarily, the only outward sign of the sudden surge of adrenaline coursing through his veins. The relentless march of time appeared to screech to a standstill, the very air practically suffocating with a tense stillness.Ezra slowly rose from the high-backed leather chair, his long legs uncrossing with deliberate grace that contradicted the simmering tension beneath his composed exterior. His piercing blue eyes narrowed as he surveyed his flawless reflection in the gleaming brass doorknob.

Not a single thread was out of place on his meticulously tailored grey suit, the fine fabric perfectly highlighting his tall, slender frame. His coal-black hair was neatly styled, not a strand daring to fall out of place. Ezra was the very picture of controlled power, every aspect of his refined, sophisticated look carefully projecting an air of unshakable confidence.

Reaching out, Ezra's long, slender fingers curled around the cool brass. He held his breath, the weight of the moment thick with anticipation. Slowly, deliberately, he twisted the knob, feeling the subtle mechanisms shifting and turning with a satisfying, mechanical precision. This doorknob, like every other meticulously selected element within his office, reflected his commitment to order and calculated control. With a final, resolute motion, Ezra pulled the heavy oak door open, the hinges creaking softly in protest.

Immediately, a sudden rush of the outside world spilled into the dimly lit confines of his office, assaulting his senses. The muffled cacophony of the city - the rumble of traffic, the distant sounds of voices, the patter of rain against the pavement - all trespassing into the carefully controlled environment he had so meticulously managed.

There, hesitating nervously on the threshold, was Emily Glass - his client, a woman he had been meeting with for the past few weeks. Her neatly styled dark brown hair was pulled back into a severe, no-nonsense bun, the precise styling framing the modest, almost bashful ensemble she had chosen. The muted colors of her blouse and skirt did little to hide the delicate curves of her petite figure, the fabric clinging just enough to suggest a carefully restrained allure.

Ezra's lips curled into a subtle, appreciative smile as he took in Emily's appearance. The way the light played across her delicate features, casting soft shadows that accentuated the elegant lines of her petite figure - it was a sight he found himself looking forward to with each of their sessions. There was something captivating about the way she carried herself, a graceful balance that seemed to originate from within. "Emily, you're looking lovely as always," he said, his voice low and warm, tinged with a note of genuine admiration.

Their eyes met, and Emily felt almost hypnotized by the warmth and familiarity in his gaze. There was a connection she had developed for him, an unspoken understanding that had grown steadily over the past weeks. She found herself drawn into those depths, her pulse quickening slightly as she felt the familiar pull of his charismatic presence.

"Thank you, Ezra," Emily replied, the faintest hint of a blush coloring her cheeks as she stepped into the room, her body moving almost of its own accord. She carried herself with quiet confidence, a composed demeanor that opposed the subtle fluttering of her heart.

"I'm so pleased you could join me." The easy confidence in his tone put her instantly at ease, and Emily found herself laughing lightly in response, the tension easing from her shoulders as she surrendered to the comfortable familiarity of their interactions.

 Settled now within the cozy confines of the room, Emily took in the familiar surroundings, not removing her eyes from Ezras figure. It was a space she had come to find comfort in over the past weeks - the plush armchair, the soothing neutral tones, the air of quiet seduction. With a small smile, she moved to take her usual seat, ready to start their discussion, though a part of her wished they could linger in the moment just a little while longer, as she savored the warmth and intimacy that seemed to flow so effortlessly.

As Emily settled into her usual seat, Ezra's gaze lingered on her, a hint of warmth and familiarity in his expression. "Welcome back, Emily," he said, his voice carrying a velvet timbre that sent a subtle shiver down her spine. "How have you been?"

Emily tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, a slight nervousness in her movements. "I-I've been doing okay, I guess," she replied, her voice soft and a little shy. "Things have been...well, a little better, I think."

Ezra nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. "I'm glad to hear that." He leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled thoughtfully. "And how have you been feeling, emotionally? Anything you'd like to share with me?"

Emily hesitated for a moment, her gaze darting down to her hands in her lap. "Actually, there is something..." She paused, taking a deep breath before meeting his eyes again. "I... I’ve been thinking about you a lot, Ezra. More than I probably should." A faint blush crept across her cheeks.

Ezra's expression softened, and he reached out to gently squeeze her hand. "Emily, you know you can be honest with me about anything. I'm here to listen, whenever you're ready to talk." His thumb traced small circles on the back of her hand, the touch electric and comforting all at once.

Emily felt herself being drawn into his warmth, her own hand instinctively turning to entwine their fingers. "I... I just feel so comfortable with you, Ezra," she admitted, her eyes shining with a mix of vulnerability and trust. "I don't know, it's just...different, when I'm with you."

Ezra's expression softened, and he gently squeezed Emily's hand before pulling away. "Emily, I appreciate your honesty. You know, I care about you deeply, but as your therapist, I have certain boundaries." He paused, considering his words carefully.

“I know,” Emily replied, her voice barely above a whisper, a hint of uncertainty lacing her words. “It’s just that I can’t stop thinking about you, and I know I shouldn’t, but… I want to.”

Ezra’s gaze fell, his expression a haunting mix of disappointment and a sinister thrill. He began whispering words, sparking a dangerous curiosity for Emily. But just as she opened her mouth to probe deeper, his demeanor shifted. He flashed a broad smile, locking her in an intense gaze that felt…unique.

The air thickened with unspoken tension, and Emily felt a chill creeping up her spine, as if the shadows around them were listening, waiting. “Tell you what, how about we take a short break, and I'll brew us some tea?" Ezra offered, his voice warm and reassuring. "I find that a nice cup of tea can sometimes help calm the nerves and give us both a chance to collect our thoughts."

Emily felt a flicker of disappointment, but she nodded, "Tea would be great, thank you," she replied, trying to keep her tone neutral.

As Ezra stood and made his way to the small kitchenette in the corner of his office, Emily found herself missing his comforting presence. She couldn't help but wonder if she had overstepped some unspoken boundary, and a part of her longed for the intimacy they had shared just moments ago.

Ezra returned shortly, two steaming mugs of fragrant tea in hand. "Here you are," he said, handing one to Emily. "I find a good Earl Grey can do wonders." He settled back into his chair, his gaze thoughtful. 

Emily clutched the warm mug as if it were her only lifeline, desperately trying to hold on to the fleeting sense of familiarity and safety it provided. But as she sipped the liquid, a creeping dizziness overtook her, and she felt like she was being pulled into a half-formed nightmare.

Her eyes met Ezra's, but instead of finding comfort in his gaze, she saw a flicker of uncertainty and a silent plea for him to bridge the growing gap between them. His smile chilled her to the bone as he sat down his cup, the warmth of the room dissipating with his every move.

"Why do I feel so strange?" she murmured, shadows flickering at the edges of her vision like twisted remnants of a nightmare.

Ezra's chilling words hung heavily in the air, a dire omen that sent panic surging through her body. "Your longing for affection has clouded your judgment," he said with an evil gleam in his eyes.

The room spun around her as she tried to make sense of what was happening. She reached out for Ezra, but he seemed impossibly far away, shrouded in an aura of dread.

As if sensing her fear, the mug slipped from her fingers and shattered against the floor, a violent end to her fleeting sense of safety. The shards glimmered ominously in the flickering candlelight as she stood frozen, heart pounding, under the weight of Ezra's words.

"What's happening?" she whispered, her voice trembling with fear.

But Ezra only rose from his chair like a dark specter looming over her.

“Emily, I need to ask you something.” “Why did you cheat on your husband and abandon your children?” His voice dripped with the bitterness of betrayal, and her breath caught in her throat. “Why did you end life before it even began?

The silence that followed was deafening, each second stretching into eternity. Suddenly, a grotesque sound broke the stillness—a wet, slithering noise that made her stomach churn. Emily's eyes widened in horror as she became painfully aware of something crawling across the tiled floor coming towards her.

 She instinctively wanted to move, to flee from the confrontation, but her body felt heavy as dread pooled in her gut. The noise grew louder, a sickening squelch that echoed, reverberating against her skull. Then, emerging from the shadows, she saw it—a grotesque figure, glistening and misshapen, an unborn fetus crawling towards her. Its skin was translucent, the veins pulsing visibly beneath the surface.

Emily wanted to scream, to turn and run, but her body would not allow it, a paralyzing fear taking hold. As it drew closer, its unopened eyes locked onto hers, a deep, haunting gaze that seemed to penetrate her very soul. The room grew colder, the candlelight flickering more violently as if in response to the terror unfolding before her.

Then, in a chilling crescendo, the creature let out a shriek that pierced the silence, a sound that was both otherworldly and heartbreakingly human. “Mommmyyy!” it wailed, the word dripping with a sorrowful accusation that sent a shiver down her spine. “Why?”

Emily's heart raced as she was forced to confront the depths of her actions, the life she had discarded, and the family she had forsaken.  The creature continued to crawl toward her, each movement a haunting reminder of what could have been. 

As she finally found the strength to speak, her voice trembled, barely a whisper, “I—” But before she could finish, the darkness enveloped her, and the walls of the kitchen seemed to close in, leaving only the echo of that heart-wrenching question hanging in the air. The last thing she saw was the glimmering eyes of the being, reflecting her shattered reflection—a mother lost to her own despair.

The darkness seemed to press in on Emily from all sides, becoming suffocating and oppressive. The weight of her past sins bore down on her like an unbearable burden, each memory a sharp dagger twisting in her heart. She tried to cry out, to beg for forgiveness, but her voice was lost in the maelstrom of emotions that threatened to consume her.

As the creature drew closer, its form shifting and contorting in ways that defied reason, Emily's mind raced with a tumult of regret and anguish. Images of her husband's betrayed face and her children's tear-streaked cheeks flashed before her eyes, a stark reminder of the pain she had caused. She reached out a trembling hand, desperate to touch the creature, to offer some semblance of comfort in the face of its haunting accusation.

As Emily's fingers delicately, almost reverently, traced the undulating, pulsating contours of the otherworldly creature's flesh, a profound and unsettling rupture seemed to overtake her senses. In that moment, the very fabric of reality around her splintered and shattered, like fragile glass cracking under immense pressure.

The world as Emily knew became a kaleidoscope of distorted, fragmented memories, floating images that swirled and danced through the air around her. Shards of recollection and half-remembered moments reflecting and refracting in a dizzying, hallucinatory display. Familiar scenes and faces warped and distorted, as if viewed through a fun-house mirror.

This sensory onslaught assaulted Emily's consciousness, leaving her struggling to discern the tenuous, ever-shifting boundaries between waking and sleep, between the material world and the realm of pure fantasy. The flow of these surreal visions was dizzying, disorienting - a maelstrom of perceptions that threatened to completely unravel the very foundations of her reality.

Just as quickly as this kaleidoscopic deluge had enveloped her, however, it began to recede, the fragmented impressions fading away, dissolving into an encroaching, all-consuming darkness. A darkness that soon blotted out the tangible world entirely, leaving behind only a familiar, pervasive emptiness - the same yawning, numbing void that Emily had grown all too accustomed to.

Where vibrant, overwhelming sensations had once threatened to engulf her, there was now only a hollow silence, a complete absence that threatened to swallow her whole. The transition was as sudden as it was disorienting, plunging Emily into a realm of pure nothingness - a state of being that had become all too common in her life, this unwelcome, unsettling void.

[As the primal sensations from her previous harrowing ordeal gradually subsided, Emily found herself adrift in emotional ambiguity](). The relentless march of time had become entirely unmoored; its steady progression rendered imperceptible as she awoke  prone upon a chilled metallic surface. Had mere seconds elapsed since the dissolution of that nightmarish trance, or had an unfathomable eternity transpired in the interim?

Blinking rapidly, Emily's vision slowly became clear, hazy shapes and muted colors gradually cohering out of the initial blackness that had shrouded her senses. Yet this gradual return to perceptual did little to ease the overwhelming uncertainty that gripped her. Was this the much-anticipated restoration of some semblance of objective reality, or merely the onset of yet another hallucinatory vision - a continuation of the hellish phantasmagoria that had so recently engulfed her consciousness?

Panic began to well up within Emily as her eyes darted frantically about the dimly lit room, desperately attempting to decipher whether the traumas she had endured had finally reached their conclusion, or if an even more nightmarish reality now surrounded her.

The complete lack of clear temporal and spatial anchors was maddening, leaving Emily utterly adrift, unmoored from any fixed point of reference. Just as she dared to entertain the prospect that the worst had passed, a dawning realization crept in: the cessation of one horrific ordeal didn’t guarantee the start of something better. In fact, it could herald the beginning of an even more terrifying nightmare.

Her pulse quickened as she strained to take in the stark, sterile environment around her. The cold, fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows that danced on the walls. Panic threatened to rise as she grappled with the unsettling possibility that her tribulations were far from over. The break she had so desperately craved might prove to be nothing more than a fleeting illusion—a momentary lull before true horror began to unfold.

Suddenly, the sole visible entryway swung open. Emily's eyes widened as she beheld Ezra, but he was not the same. Gone was the grey suit he had worn before. Now, he stood before her in a somber black ensemble, his sleeves rolled up grappling a large toolbox in his hands, moving with a deliberate, almost ominous pace that sent a chill down her spine.



As he entered the room, he seemed to completely disregard Emily's presence, his attention singularly trained on the task at hand.

Without so much as a glance in her direction, Ezra strode purposefully towards a table situated behind where she sat, the heavy thud of the toolbox punctuating each of his confident, measured steps. Once he reached the designated surface, he unceremoniously set down his tools, echoing through the oppressive silence that blanketed the space.

"Where am I? Why are you doing this to me?" Emily cried out; her voice tinged with rising panic as she struggled futilely against the unseen bonds that held her immobilized her words slurring as they escaped her mouth. Disoriented and overwhelmed with dread, she frantically tried to piece together how she had ended up in this dire predicament.

"Please, I won't tell anyone, “She pleaded, her desperate tone betraying the profound fear that gripped her. "Just let me go!"

But Ezra remained stoic and unresponsive, his gaze hardened and his features impassive as he continued his methodical movements around the room.

Without a word, he stepped back and Emily felt the solid surface beneath her beginning to shift. To her horror, the table she was secured to started rising mechanically, lifting her upwards until she found herself face-to-face with Ezra. Staring into his eyes, Emily was struck by how the familiar warm regard she had once found so comforting had been utterly extinguished. Gone was the gentle kindness she had grown accustomed to - in its place was a piercing, unsettling intensity that made her blood run cold.

What had once been a source of solace and reassurance had now transformed into the stuff of nightmares. Trapped in this horrific scenario, Emily's racing heartbeat echoed in her ears as a single, haunting question burned in her mind: what unspeakable fate did Ezra now have in store for her?

As the table continued its slow, ominous ascent, bringing her ever closer to her captor, Emily desperately wracked her brain, trying to find some glimmer of hope, some way to appeal to the man she had once trusted implicitly. Perhaps she could reason with him, appeal to whatever shred of humanity remained. Or maybe, if she could just keep him talking, an opportunity for escape might present itself.

With a deep, shuddering breath, she strengthened herself and met Ezra's unblinking gaze. "Ezra, please," she began, her voice quivering slightly despite her efforts to sound calm and level-headed. "I don't understand what's happening here. Just talk to me - tell me what this is all about.”

She paused, searching his face for any glimmer of recognition, any sign that the man she had known was still in there, somewhere. "I know you, Ezra. You're a good person - you've always been so kind to me. Please, let's just talk this through."

As the table reached its full height, bringing Emily level with Ezra, she held his gaze, silently pleading for him to see reason, to remember the bond they had once shared. In the tense, unyielding silence that followed, the weight of their history together seemed to hang heavy in the air, a faint glimmer of hope warring with the overwhelming dread that consumed her.

“Those questions are exactly why I can't let you leave," Ezra said firmly. "You didn’t even ask about your family you don’t deserve to see them again. You're not a good person, Emily.” Her initial fear was quickly replaced by an overwhelming sadness as she realized the truth in his words. “I do love my family and I've made mistakes,” she admitted, her voice trembling. “That's why I came here, to try and become a better person. I want to be the mother my children deserve and give my husband the love he needs. And I know what happened with my daughter was a terrible mistake, one that I will regret for the rest of my life.”

 She couldn’t hold back the tears any longer as the memories of that night flooded back. “You saw your deepest fears, didn't you?” Ezra asked, remembering the grotesque figure from her nightmare tears started streaming down her face, Emily nodded silently. “If that was all true Emily, when did you confess your attraction to me.”

Ezra's footsteps echoed ominously as he approached the weathered wooden table where he had left his worn leather bag. With deliberate slowness, he began extracting various items, the soft rustling sending chills down Emily's spine. Though she couldn't see what he was retrieving, the metallic clinks and scrapes filled her imagination with terrifying possibilities.

As Ezra moved around the room, his shoes scuffing against the concrete floor, Emily instinctively squeezed her eyes shut. Her heart raced, pounding so loudly in her ears she feared Ezra might hear it. Sweat beaded on her forehead as waves of fear washed over her.

In a voice as soft and silky as a spider's web, barely above a whisper, Ezra urged, "Open your eyes, Emily." The gentleness in his tone only heightened her dread. Seconds stretched into an eternity as Emily kept her eyes firmly closed, willing herself to wake from this nightmare.

The silence was shattered as Ezra's voice cut through the air, sharper and more insistent: "Open your eyes." Each word dripped with menace, his patience clearly wearing thin.

Still, Emily resisted, her entire body trembling. Without hesitation this time, Ezra's voice exploded in rage, causing Emily to flinch violently. "Open your eyes or I'll cut your eyelids off your face!" he roared, his words reverberating off the walls like a physical blow. The threat hung in the air, as palpable as the acrid scent of fear that permeated the room.

Emily's eyes flew open to find Ezra standing in front of her, holding a framed picture of her husband and daughters and a portable speaker. Fear and confusion overtook her as she asked, “How did you get that photo? What are you going to do with it?” But before Emily could comprehend the situation, Ezra began to speak in a calm, calculated tone. “Let me explain this process to you. When the human body experiences trauma - or in your case, a twisted hallucination - it doesn't just affect the mind. It physically breaks down, as if you were in a horrific car crash. But for you, it's like experiencing 10 crashes at once. Right now, your mental and physical capacities are pushed to their limits. I would ask about your pain, but you're probably numb - dissociating from the horrors of reality.”

 As Ezra propped the framed picture and speaker he placed his finger on Emily's forehead, her body froze in a state of catatonia, unable to feel anything except the terror consuming her mind.

A sadistic smile spreads across Ezra's face as he approaches the bound and helpless Emily. With gentle steps, he places a blank CD into the speaker, taunting her with the reminder of their second session. "Do you remember, Emily?" He sneers, relishing her fear. "The one where you confessed to cheating on your husband and betraying your family? You mentioned a song that brought back all the pain and guilt, didn't you? 'Crazy Bitch', I believe it was."

His voice drips with venom as he grabs her chin and forces her to meet his gaze. "But what you also told me was that without my help, you would have ended it all. That the memories were too much to bear." With a sickening grin, he places his hand on top of her head and nods at her, mimicking a yes motion. "Yes, see, I remember." As Emily's eyes widen in terror, Ezra walks behind her and retrieves a roll of tape from his toolbox. With precise movements, he tapes her eyelids open, forcing her to stare at a picture of her family. "You will not look away," he growls in her ear. "You will be forced to relive your worst sensations over and over again."

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



Ezra turned to leave the room, but not before playing the haunting song that Emily couldn't escape. She was trapped, forced to face her family as the lyrics of the devastating song filled her ears. The torture continued for hours, until Ezra offered her a way out. He placed a razor blade in her hands and loosened her restraints just enough to give her some freedom. As he gave her a sinister look, he warned her that she didn't have the strength to survive on her own anymore, since he had been her anchor and now her sanity had sailed away.

 

 



"Don't make too much of a mess," he advised before walking out of the room one last time. When he returned, he found a bloodied and chaotic scene. "crazy bitch," Ezra muttered as he began to clean up and restore the controlled aura of the room.
