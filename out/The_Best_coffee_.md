I went to a local coffee shop in a town I was visiting on a business trip. The barista was listening to some folky music I’ve never heard before. She had black hair and glasses. She seemed rather shy. I could tell by how she looked at me, she thought I was a handsome fella.

Of course I am, I’m a former college football player and rather successful businessman. I was dressed rather nicely and carried myself well. I walked up to her and looked at the menu. 

“Tell you what, darling. How about you surprise me. Make something you think I’d like.” 

She looked towards the blackboard a minute. “Hmmm. I can do that. What size would you want?”

“Large.”

“Gotcha, okay $6.50.” Damn these coffee prices. She turned around the screen once I handed her my card so I would pick a tip. Damn these too. I clicked the 20% button. 

“Coming right up. I’ll bring it to you.” 

I walked over to a table and pulled my laptop out. Figured I could knock out some work since I had some free time. I looked around and noticed I was the only customer. 

“Here you are.” She sat down a warm coffee in a white mug in front of me. The color was Carmel brown and had an extremely sweet smell to it.  

I was reading a report and pulled it up to my lips. I couldn’t believe it, it had to have been the best cup of coffee in my life. It went down my body so warmly and made me feel like warm honey was running through my body. I began drinking it as quickly as a thirsty man would drink water. 

I looked up at the barista and she gave me a shy smile. She spoke to me but her lips weren’t moving. It’s like my brain was registering what she was saying. Gosh, she was beautiful. She had to have been the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.

“I need you to take care of my ex boyfriend and his girlfriend. She was once my friend.” She looked down at a knife on the counter in front of her. 

I couldn’t do that. There’s no way I could. I felt my body moving though. I had no control over my legs. I walked over to her and picked the knife up. I tried to stop myself, but I couldn’t. 

She looked back up at me and her eyes were pure black. I felt terrified but even more so how I still thought she was gorgeous and lovely. Her lips still didn’t move. 

“Take care of them.” I watched her drop a small airplane bottle in the trash can behind her while she kept eye contact with me. 

She looked down at it and back at me, “don’t worry about that potion. It’s already in effect.” 

I began to walk out of the shop and got in my car. She never gave me the address but I knew where to go. My body just knew which directions to go. 

I kept trying to tell my body to stop but I had no control. I pulled up a nice apartment complex and found myself walking up to room 170.

I knocked on the door and a skinny man with a scraggly beard opened the door. He looked at me. “Whatcha want?” 

That’s all he said before I plunged the knife into his stomach. He looked up at me with fear and I spoke to him.

“You always said you’d love me until you die.” I jerked the knife out. He turned to run but I grabbed him and got him in the back a couple times. He fell on the ground and tried to crawl. I kicked his head. 

I heard a scream as I seen his new girlfriend standing in horror. She had a towel wrapped around her. It fell off as I grabbed her by the arm and drove the knife into her chest.

I spoke up again. “How could you betray me? You were my best friend!” She dropped.

I turned back to the guy and screamed. “You gave me your heart and I’m taking what is mine.” 

I cut him open and jerked his heart out. I stepped out of the house and threw it in the parking lot. 

A woman walking by seen me covered in blood and screamed. She ran and pulled her phone out. 

The barista came walking by and picked up the heart. She looked at me. Her mouth never opened once.

“Thanks for the help. Maybe I’ll come and get you one day.” She walked off. 

I looked down at my hands and screamed. The horror of what I had done kicked in and I began to vomit. 

I can hear the police sirens now. Please be cautious when you order coffee.
