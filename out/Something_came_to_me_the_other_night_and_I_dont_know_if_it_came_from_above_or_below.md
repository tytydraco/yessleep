I don’t know why I’m posting this here.

I’m not looking for advice, or sympathy. It’s not that kind of problem.

I think I’m just… supposed to tell people. As many as I can.

I’ve always had a weird relationship with sleep. My brain doesn’t turn off the way it’s supposed to. Most nights I’m just lying there, cycling through stray thoughts like radio static; did I lock the door, how much milk is left, what happens when you die. That kind of thing.

But the other night wasn’t like that.

There was a moment; maybe a few seconds, maybe longer, where everything just... paused.

I was lying in bed with the lights off. The TV was still playing some late-night rerun, but I’d muted it maybe twenty minutes earlier. The fridge in the next room was humming, and there was this soft buzz from the streetlight outside the window. Everything normal.

Until it wasn’t.

I don’t know how else to describe it, but something shifted. The air got heavy. Not hot. Not cold. Just thick. Like the atmosphere in the room had been replaced with something else. Something dense and old.

I remember staring at the ceiling and realizing the fridge had stopped humming. That buzzing outside? Gone. It wasn’t just quiet. It was hollow. Like the silence wasn’t the absence of sound, but the presence of something else.

I didn’t realize how long I’d been holding my breath until I heard Luna growl.

That’s when I sat up.

That’s when everything started to unravel.

Luna’s not much of a guard dog.

I got her thinking she might be some kind of deterrent. Big enough to look scary from a distance, German Shepherd mix with those amber eyes that catch the porch light just right. But if someone actually broke in, I’m pretty sure she’d roll over for belly rubs and beg for snacks.

That’s why the growl stopped me cold.

It wasn’t loud, but it was low, drawn-out, like a warning pulled from deep in her chest. Not at the door, not toward the window. She was facing the corner of the room. The one across from the bed. Ears back. Hackles up. Eyes fixed.

At first I thought maybe she heard something outside. A raccoon, maybe. Or a car.

But then I looked where she was looking.

And at first, I thought it was empty.

Not just “nothing there” empty, but void empty. Like something was missing from that space. Like light didn’t touch it. Like dust didn’t settle there. I stared, trying to convince myself I was just tired, my eyes playing tricks on me.

But the longer I looked, the more I realized it wasn’t empty.

There was a shape there. Faint. Blurred. Shifting, like seeing something at the bottom of a dark pool, the surface rippling just enough to make it wrong.

I couldn’t make out edges. Or limbs. Or symmetry. It didn’t even feel like it had a direction.

And I don’t think it appeared. I think it was always there.  Maybe it was *always* always there, like it's the reason it didn't put my bookcase in that corner when I first moved in.  I think something inside me just… unlocked. And now I could see it.

Luna whimpered.

And the thing, whatever it was, started to move.

It moved like it had always been in motion, like my eyes had only just caught up.

The shape in the corner expanded. Not outward, not into the room, but into my mind. The more I looked at it, the more I felt like there was too much of it. Like it wasn’t taking up space, it was pressurizing it. Folding the corners of reality inward.

Then the lights died.

Not just in my room, outside too. The streetlight, the porch glow across the road, all of it snapped off like someone had flipped the switch on the world. My eyes adjusted, but the darkness didn’t feel like darkness. It felt like velvet stretched too tight over something pulsing and alive.

And then I saw it.

Rings.

Huge ones, orbiting each other like slow machinery. Each one made of flesh; reddish, raw, veined. Not metal. Not stone. Something organic. You could see the muscles shifting under the surface as they turned.

The rings were covered in eyes. Not pairs, individual ones. Small, large, slitted, lidless. Some blinked sideways, some didn’t blink at all. None of them looked at me. They just looked.

Hovering above it was a halo, not a circle of light, but a rotating loop of what looked like human teeth. Yellowed, chipped, still connected to pieces of root and jawbone. It clicked softly as it spun.

The air was vibrating now. Not with sound, but pressure. My teeth started to ache. My nose began to bleed. I felt something behind my eyes like they were swelling in their sockets.

And then, it spoke. Not aloud. Inside. The words slid into my skull like oil, bypassing ears and language. But I knew what it said.

“Do not be afraid.”

The voice was made of stone and hunger. It wasn’t comfort. It was command. It was a lion telling a mouse to stay still.

My stomach turned. My fingers clenched involuntarily. I couldn’t breathe.

I saw something in my mind’s eye then. A name. Not a name you could pronounce. Not a sound you could speak. It was more like a scar across my memory.

I think it looked like this:

𝓚̷̟̗͎͋͐̑͒𝖊̴̻̪̲̦̝̈́̓͠𝕡̸̤̪̾̀̀̔̽̏͗̿𝒉̵̬̠̜̖͚̱͎̋́͘͝͠͠𝕣̶̛̠̩̖͙̹̾̌𝓪̸̨̛̥͖̖̺̲̙̻͋͒̓̍̐̑͝͝𝒐̷̰̟͇̝̄̍̀̾͗̍͝𝖓̸̩̇̎͐̅̓̕

I shouldn’t have written that.  I think it loses something in text, but every time I picture it in my mind I get pressure behind my eyes.  I don't think we’re supposed to see it.

Luna whined.

I turned toward her, toward the only living thing in the room I still understood. She was standing now, fully alert, staring at me. At the blood coming from my nose.

Then she turned to face the thing. And she barked. The bark echoed once, sharp and loud in the dead room.

And then every eye on the angel snapped to her.

Not gradually. Not in sequence. All at once. Hundreds of them. Wet, blinking, red-rimmed, rimless—fixing on Luna like she was the only thing that existed. I tried to move. To say something. But my body wasn’t mine anymore. The air felt like it was being sucked from the room.

Luna barked again. This time it broke. It cracked halfway through like something had caught in her throat. And then there was a sound. A crunch. A single, wet, final noise. I didn’t see it touch her. It didn’t move. But in the space between heartbeats, she was gone.

In her place was a cube.

Maybe three inches across. Maybe four. Tightly packed fur, rippling slightly, still warm. I didn’t scream. I couldn’t. The thing turned back to me, though I still couldn’t tell how. There was no front, no face. Only orbiting flesh and eyes and teeth.

And then it spoke again. But this time, not a phrase. Not a single intrusion. A flood.

Words filled my head like black water rushing through a burst pipe. Concepts more than sentences. Images I couldn’t unsee. Cities drowned in ash. Skies torn like paper. People on their knees facing altars that bled.

I heard myself sobbing. Didn’t even know I’d started.

It called me something then. “The last prophet.” I don’t remember the rest. My mind buckled. My nose was bleeding again, and my ears felt like they were going to burst.

I felt myself falling before I hit the ground.

I came to on the floor. Face down. Mouth dry. Shirt stuck to my skin like I’d been sweating for hours. My head throbbed. My ears rang. My body didn’t feel bruised, but my mind did. Like something had rattled loose inside it.

For a minute I didn’t move. I just stared at the carpet, trying to remember where I was. And then I smelled it. Sulfur. Thick and clinging. Like fire and rot had kissed the walls and decided to stay.

I sat up slowly. The room was exactly as I’d left it, almost. The lights were back. The TV had resumed its quiet flicker. But above my bed, scorched into the ceiling, was a perfect black ring. Like something had hovered there and burned its memory into the plaster.

And Luna... Luna was back. Curled up near the door, head tucked into her side, breathing shallow. For a second I thought I’d imagined it all. That I’d had some kind of breakdown. A dream, a seizure, a psychotic break. But she wouldn’t come near me. Wouldn’t eat.
Wouldn’t respond to her name. And her eyes, they didn’t look at me. Not really. They looked past me.

I took her for a walk that morning. I didn’t know what else to do. The sun was out. The world looked fine. But when we passed the corner store, I saw it again. Just for a second, like an image flickering across a broken screen. The building was gone. In its place: charred ruins. The parking lot was cracked, glowing with heat. The air shimmered with smoke, and above it all, there it was. Hovering. Rings turning. Eyes blind. Teeth spinning in slow, soft rhythm.

Then it was gone.

Luna had stopped walking. She was staring, too. I didn’t ask if she saw it. I don’t think I want to know.

I still don’t know if it was real. I want to believe it wasn’t. But my ceiling is still scorched. Luna still won’t eat. I still see things I shouldn’t.

I haven’t slept since. Not really. Every time I close my eyes, I feel it hovering. Not in the room, but just outside, like it's waiting to see what I do. And I can’t stop thinking about what it said.

The last prophet.

That’s what it called me.

I don’t know what that means. I’m not religious. I don’t go to church. I’m not even sure I believe in God. But I believe in *it.* I believe in what I saw.

So here it is. My warning. If you live near a church, or a mosque, or a synagogue, go. Pray to anything.  I don't know what being this thing serves, but something has to be better than nothing.

And if you’re in a city, get out. I think that’s where it’s going to start. I keep seeing fire and ash. People kneeling in the streets. Places I know, burning.

I don’t know how much time we have.

I don’t even know if this post will matter.

But I think this is what it wants.

For me to spread the word.

For you to know.
