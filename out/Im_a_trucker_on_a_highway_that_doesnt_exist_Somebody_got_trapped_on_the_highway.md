Over the next few weeks, Autumn and I chatted nearly every day. How did I do this when she had no radio to talk to me with, you ask?

“Hey Randall, don’t get worried if I go silent for a few days. My handheld just broke.”

“You better be joking. That thing costs a literal fortune. Management will fillet me alive.”

“Fairly sure the phrase is ‘*flay* me alive.’”

“Wait. Brendon. How is it broken if you’re talking to me right now?”

“‘K, bye!”

“Brendon? *Brendon*!”

I left the transmitter with Autumn before I headed out.

When I returned from my haul, Randall and dispatch were pretty ticked about me losing my second radio in a month (they really do cost a fortune), but what were they going to do? Fire me?

Sometimes Autumn and I would talk about serious things―irrational fears, wishes, dangers we’d encountered on the road, things we’d shouted at our parents but wished we could take back―but most days we talked about silly, little nothings. Music, TV, stupid things we did in high school.

“No way,” I told her. “I refuse to believe you spiked your teacher’s iced tea.”

“Nicest she’s ever been to us.”

“But that’s illegal. Like hardcore *illegal*.”

“First off, I was sixteen, so lay off. Second, with how much vodka we put it in, she absolutely would have figured out what we’d done. She was just looking for an excuse to drink at school.”

And another time:

“So what does happen if I let my breath out in a tunnel?” I asked.

“Your breath in a tunnel?”

“You told me to hold my breath in tunnels. I assumed some terrible thing would happen otherwise.”

She burst out laughing. “Oh gosh. I forgot about that. I was just messing with you. How long has it been now? Over a month? You’re still doing that?”

It was nice having someone my own age to talk to. I really was friends with the other drivers, but let’s be real; most of them had kids and a mortgage. It wasn’t like I was going to swap BFF bracelets with any of them any time soon (not that Autumn and I did that. Ick. Just saying though). But for the first time in months, there was somebody to talk to just for the sake of talking. 

I wasn’t trying to ‘fit in.’ I wasn’t trying to prove I was mature enough to slide in with the real adult crowd―again, let’s be real; I *wasn’t.* But that was the point. I was in my early twenties. Why should I *have* to be mature? Why should I have to review every sentence in my head before I spoke it? With Autumn I could simply *talk*.

“What has you so peachy?” Tiff asked me a few weeks into our conversations.

“Hmm? Nothing. What do you mean?”

“Usually, you look like somebody with weights around their ankles. No offense. Recently, though… How to put it? It’s like they’ve been replaced with helium balloons.”

There were, of course, downsides.

Autumn preferred we stay on low traffic channels where the others weren’t likely to hear us.

“Why?” I asked once.

“Not one of them ever tried to help me. I’ve failed at so many things in my life. I figure I can at least succeed at holding a grudge.”

I didn’t push. Who she forgave was her prerogative, but it was moments like that made me somber, forced me to admit she couldn’t totally trust me either. I still hadn't told her the truth about her lane-locking. What good would it do? What good would it do any of them?

Except of course, it really might have done them good. Chris, for example. He could quit now before the road claimed him. *Everybody* could quit, get normal jobs, accept normal salaries. abandon Route 333 forever, let the impossibilities pile up in the real world.

In reality, it was *everybody else* the knowledge wouldn't be good for. If Chris quit, somebody else would lane-lock―or worse. Randall had shared with me gruesome stories of things that happened when people didn’t comply with the road’s wishes. My drowning experience in the shower was mild. Nobody would remove impossibilities. The darkness at dispatch would escape into the real world.

For weeks, I deliberated what to do. That’s the one thing the road gives you: thinking time. Hours and hours of it. Sometimes I would go entire days without turning on an audio book, gut churning as I drove.

 As a child, things were so easy to label. Wrong or right. Bad or good. Immoral or moral. It was all so much more nuanced now. 

Who did my loyalty belong to? Did I trust my co-workers to make the right choice and keep driving like I had? Did I still owe them the truth even if they wouldn’t? What number was an acceptable amount to sacrifice to protect the world as a whole, and why did it have to be *my* responsibility to decide that?

*Because you assaulted Randall with a boxcutter.* *That’s why.*

On top of that, I *was* trying to get everybody out. Couldn’t I just wait to spill the secrets until there was a solution? Autumn and I were waiting until my broken ribs healed to put our plan into action―then again, they were basically healed. If I was honest, we were stalling out of fear. Was I allowed to wait? Was it my responsibility to act immediately and recklessly? What if there really was no solution?

*What should I do?*

But that’s the funny thing about decisions; if you wait long enough, eventually they make themselves.

Weeks later, when Chris’ voice finally rang out on the general channel, I was hardly even surprised. His news was the kiss of raindrops after a day of dark clouds: inevitable.

“It happened,” he said. “I lane-locked.”



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



The rest of us arrived over the next few hours. Our schedules had overlapped that day. We’d planned a game of poker that would never happen now. One by one, we maneuvered our rigs onto the shoulder of the redwood section and got out.

The vibe teetered somewhere between a tailgate party and a funeral. Vikram and Deidree were speaking with Chris just outside the cab of his rig. Estela (haven’t talked much about her before, whoops) walked with me as I approached.

“How bad is it?” I asked.

“He got lucky. We’re close to dispatch.” 

It was true. For me, this was a thirty minute drive at most.

“Lane-lock distances are different for everybody,” she continued. “He’ll have to measure over a few days to get a more accurate idea, but we’re probably sitting at twelve to fourteen months.”

Something tight in my stomach loosened. “A year? That’s not so bad.”

“Not *as* bad, no. It’s still a year.”

“Yeah, but like his life isn’t over. He can still make it out.” 

Estela slowed down. Her dark eyebrows creased. We were still out of earshot of the others. “Tone this down. You seem almost cheerful about this all.”

In a way, she was right. I’d already known this was coming, so for me, this was the best possible solution. Chris could still escape. My silence hadn't totally ruined his life. 

*Even so.*

“You’re right. I’ll be more sensitive―to be fair, Chris doesn’t look too distressed.”

Estela snorted. “Don’t encourage them.”

“Encourage them?”

But we were close enough now to hear what the three others were talking about.

“I should be the one to do it,” Vikram insisted. “The road is longest for me. An extra hour is not much.”

“It’s an hour closer to lane-locking,” Deidree said, patting Chris’ shoulder. “I don’t plan to stay as long as you. Another year or two, and I’ll have saved enough for my girls to go to school.”

“It is not chivalrous for me to let you.”

“Chivalry my―”

“*Neither* of you are doing anything,” Chris said. “It won’t work. We tried this with Tiff.”

“Sorry, do what?” I asked.

All three looked up at me. Estela was the one who answered. “These *tontos* are going to put Chris in the trailer and try driving him to headquarters for an hour. It won’t work. *I’m* certainly not volunteering to try. It will permanently add an extra driving hour to whoever tries. Cargo rules don’t apply to humans.”

“We have to try,” Deidree insisted.

“*I* have to try,” Vikram corrected.

They continued to argue, more and more heatedly.

This was partly my fault. If I’d just been honest with Chris, he could have avoided this entirely, and now he would spend a year of his life trapped on Route 333. I knew what I had to do.

I took a resigned breath. “I’ll do it.”

They stopped arguing and stared at me.

“Stay out of this,” Vikram snapped.

“*Really,* Brendon.” Deidree cussed me out.

Eventually, we only settled the matter when Estela suggested the two of them, “draw straws.” Since none of us actually knew what *drawing straws* meant in today’s day and culture, they settled it over a heated game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. 

Vikram lost.

A minute later, Deidree was shepherding Chris into the back of her truck (she’d already picked up an empty freight trailer from dispatch) and climbing into the front seat. We all settled back to watch.

It wouldn’t work. We all knew it wouldn’t. Humans are crazy that way. We gamble and smoke and scroll through social media. We can know something is pointless; we can even discuss in a group how something is pointless; then we recline in our lawn chairs and watch one another do those pointless things anyway.  

Admittedly, it was fascinating to watch.

From the start of the hour to the end of the hour, the truck barely made it ten meters. The entire time, however, it was clearly driving. The motor was humming. The wheels were spinning.  It would flash in and out of existence, sometimes for a heartbeat. Sometimes for seconds at a time. Minutes would often pass between glimpses.

Deidree and the truck were passing in and out of pockets of space. From now on, these pockets were simply part of Deidree’s road―an unnecessary part, seeing how the attempt didn’t work. Of course, it didn’t work.

At the end of the hour, Vikram, Estela, and I walked thirty or so feet to the parked semi. It wasn't like they could come to us, possibly not even see us. The whole logic of it made me grateful I never had to take another math class.

Deidree climbed out and shrugged. “Had to try.”

She unrolled the back of the trailer. Soft weeping was audible.

Chris swore. “Give me a minute. I don’t want you to see me like this.”

I was fully prepared to do just that, but Deidree climbed in, slumped down next to him, and wrapped her arm around his shoulder. “Any emotion is a fine one.”

“Who’s going to pay my bills?” Chris said. “There’s my mortgage and―and electricity. I was so close to retiring. Who’s going to take care of my fish!”

“We’ll make sure your bills get paid,” Deidree said. “You told me you keep your passwords in a book, right?

“And Chris, your fish died last month,” Vikram offered helpfully.

“I was going to get new ones!”  He sniffed and rubbed at his eyes. “My daughter has her first kid next month. I won’t be there.”

“I will,” Deidree said. “I’ll make sure they know you wish you could be too.”

We all waited in silence, letting him cry it out. It was uncomfortable―Chris had always struck me as the type of hardened man who barely even teared up at funerals―but in a way, I think it helped. Us being there.

“Thank you all,” he said eventually. Our cue to go.

 He had a drive ahead of him, after all.

Only later, back at dispatch, before I turned in my keys, did I radio Autumn. “Enough waiting. It’s time.”

Never pick up a hitchhiker. Absolutely never. Not under any circumstance.

Really, *never*.

But if you do, here are some tips.

You’ll find them at gas stations. They know we hang out there frequently. Try on and off ramps too and the edges of town. Sometimes, you’ll find them in the middle of nowhere, holding out a thumb in a cloud of sand, but it’s rare. Not worth the time.

Target individuals. No mothers with strollers. No homeless people and their dogs. Hitchhikers are strong. One is already a risk, but two at once are a bloodbath.

Aim for the disabled ones. Heartless? A bit. Yes. But again, they’re powerful, even the elderly and young. An amputated arm, however, is always an amputated arm. They can’t kill you with a limb that doesn’t exist.

In the end, I chose a heavily pregnant woman at the far reaches of town. It was the closest thing to ‘bodily impaired’ I could find on such short notice, and she was most definitely alone.

“Don’t want to be a nuisance dearie.” Her voice was the flavor of honey.  She kneaded her side with a hand. “But could I bother you for a ride?”

I smiled. “‘Course.”

Like Myra, she acted normal at first. She chatted about her children―fictional, I assumed―and how hard it was to give up smoking after getting pregnant each time. I *uh huh*\-ed and *oh really-*ed at all the correct parts.

“Such a good listener.” The woman patted my arm.

The hitchhiker could have been one of my mom’s friends. Maybe it was. Maybe all the hitchhikers took on faces we’d once seen to put us at ease. Either way, it wouldn’t work. I knew what they were now. I’d been to their home beyond Route 333 and been tricked by them twice now.

I played along. I let the pregnant hitchhiker think I believed it, that my guard was down, and that I feared nothing. I let it relax, sink back into the chair, rest its eyes. It was only when I was sure the creature suspected nothing that I finally eased the truck to a complete stop.

“What’s wrong?” the hitchhiker asked.

“Um, engine light.”

“I don’t see―”

“Now!”

The next series of events  happened in quick succession. 

Autumn rocketed out from the blanket she’d been hiding under. The hitchhiker snarled and lurched forward, but too late. Autumn was already throwing the metal chain above the seat and over the hitchhiker like we’d practiced a dozen times. It landed between the thing's protruding belly and breasts. I slammed myself against it, and Autumn yanked the chain tight. There was the click of a lock. Then a second one. I scrambled away from the hitchhiker before it could seize me.

“*Trickery! Deceit―*”

“Yeah, yeah, we’ve been over this.” I gulped to hold my heart from beating out through my throat. “For con artists, your kind are awfully easy to trick, you know that?”

The woman struggled and writhed, but the chain held. That had been our bet. We didn’t know exactly how strong these creatures were, but Autumn seemed confident the chain could hold at least one or two thousand pounds of pressure.

How had she known this, you ask? Apparently, she’d started training as a crane operator years ago (“Perks to quitting a lot,” she’d informed me).

We waited as the hitchhiker flailed and screeched. Eventually the struggles slowed, then stopped entirely. The woman glared at us and panted.

“Release me,” it said.

“Oh? Why didn’t you just tell us?” Autumn asked from my sleeper. “Brendon, she says she wants to be let go.”

“Silly us.”

The thing jerked towards Autumn, nails transformed into talons. It couldn’t reach far enough.

“We have questions,” I said. “Firstly, why do cargo rules apply to you and not humans?”

“Is this how you deal with all your problems?” it asked. “Assault and torture.”

“Until something proves more effective, yeah probably―hang on, do you know what happened with Randall? How did you find out?”

“My kind knows many things.”

“Well, you didn’t know I was under that blanket,” Autumn said. “Look, this doesn't need to be hard. We aren’t even trying to hurt you. All we need is a few answers, then we’ll let you loose to terrorize the next trucker that passes by.”

The thing lunged for my radio and twisted the dial.

“Nice try,” I said. “I pulled the fuse to that thing days ago.”

“You will regret this!”

“Likely. You don’t have to though. Just answer the question. Why don’t cargo rules apply to humans? Why just you?”

The hitchhiker yanked at the chain and strained upwards. When they held, it snarled and relaxed. “They *don’t* apply to us, foolish stone-dwellers.”

“But you can drive with us without slowing us. I drove Myra―the first hitchhiker I picked up―nearly all the way off of the road. How’s that possible?”

“We aren’t trapped, not in the way *you* are.” She directed this at Autumn. “We have never been marked by the stones, nor have we been transported as cargo. We may move freely.”

“Lies. Why would you ask us for rides if you could just walk to the exit yourself?”

“Do *you* desire to walk a thousand miles on foot?”

*Okay, fair point.* 

“And you’d just let us go after the lift?” Autumn pushed. “Somehow, I doubt that.”

The creature's lips curled back. Its hair flaked from its scalp, less and less human by the minute. The pregnant bulge remained. “We do not desire to eat you, if that is what you ask.”

“That’s not what we ask,” she said. “We already know that. What *do* you do with us?”

“My kind―we struggle with boundaries. We may not cross them without permission. It is why we request transport, rather than force it. To enter the stone’s domain, it demands specific conditions. A specific trade. To leave, it demands other conditions.”

“So you trade us?” I asked. “You trade us to leave.”

“Except this isn’t helping us,” Autumn said. “What we really need to understand is cargo rules. Why don’t they apply to humans?”

The hitchhiker smiled. Even as it strained at its constraints, it laughed. “Release me, and perhaps I will divulge this truth, though you will wish it otherwise.”

“Stop fighting already,” I said. “You’re not escaping unless we let you go. Nobody’s helping you. You’re alone.”

“I’m not alone.”

Autumn and I glanced at each other. Was it lying? It had to be. These things may have rules about thresholds, but they’d already proven they could lie. Maybe this entire conversation had been false. What did it mean it wasn't alone?

Our silent conversation was cut short when the hitchhiker let out a shriek. 

Before it had screamed, but this one was of a different variety. It wasn't the cry of restraint, rather the cry of pain. *Agony*. 

“What the―”

“Look!” Autumn pointed. 

The hitchhiker had lifted her shirt, revealing a stomach criss-crossed with stretch marks. The thing inside―before I’d assumed it was merely theater. A fake child to sprinkle sympathy onto the hitchhiker's plight. 

I’d been wrong. There *was* something in her stomach. Something trying to get out. Beneath the skin, the thing floundered and twisted. It pushed and kicked. The hitchhiker screwed its eyes and wailed.

A rip appeared in the skin. A talon rose out of the split.

“Brendon, what do we do!”

“Uh…”

The tear widened. Droplets of rot-scented, black ichor slid off the bulging stomach.

*“*Not the seats again,” I said.

Another noise apart from the hitchhiker's screeching. It was quiet at first, gurgled and muffled. As the stomach opened, and two sets of claws emerged, it grew louder: *giggling.*

Pools dripped down my seat and puddled onto the floor. Something black and slimy slid from the gaping hole. It tittered hysterically and turned a beady set of *very-much-not-human* eyes on Autumn and me.

“*Brendon*!”

It sprang.

As much as I wish I could relate how it sprang ‘out the window’ or ‘at the steering wheel’, or even that I managed to hit it out of the air―that just isn’t what happened. Instead the slimy thing jumped directly at my face. 

My mouth, acting quicker than my hands, opened in surprise. The thing gripped both sides of my head and lodged its version of a head between my teeth.

Why this was its first reaction? No idea. To be fair, it was a newborn. Its reasoning abilities were likely not the most developed.

Putrid, spoiled, rotten milk filled my mouth. I gagged and scrambled at the slimy thing. It clung tightly. Wildly, I considered biting down but was smart enough to control that impulse. It scratched at the sides of my head. *Make it stop! Get it out!* 

The slimy creature jerked free.

Autumn had seized it by its neck. She slammed down the sleeper cab window and dangled the thing outside. It giggled and lacerated her arms, but she only clutched tighter.

“Drive!” she screamed.

“What?”

“Just do it!”

I did. We picked up speed.

“Answer our question, or I drop,” she said.

The hitchhiker scrambled at her chains. Without her bulging stomach, she really might have a chance at escaping. “Mine! Give it back.”

“This is a bit extreme,” I told Autumn. “It’s just a baby.”

“It’s very much not a baby. Answer or I let go!”

We tore through the desert. Sagebrush and signposts whipped past.

“How do cargo rules work?” she asked. “How can we use them to get lane-locked humans out?”

“I refuse!” the hitchhiker shrieked, even as its eyes dilated in fear.

The newborn’s giggling heightened. A wide, demented split opened across its face. *A grin*, I realized. It was full on guffawing now.

“*Uh oh*,” it said.

At this point, the entire situation was so ridiculous, I’d basically checked out. Autumn seemed to have things under control at any rate. I pressed on the gas.

“What?” she demanded. “Do you know? Why can’t humans be cargo?”

“*Uh oh. Uh oh.*”

“Tell me!”

“*Stone-dwellers are too willing. Cargo must be unwilling.*”

“Cargo only counts as cargo, because we’re transporting it forcefully? That’s it? If we transport humans by force, unwillingly, they won’t count as lane-locked?”

The thing giggled as if in confirmation. “*And now you know. Uh oh.”*

“It answered you,” the hitchhiker begged. “Give it back!”

“Okay, okay.” Autumn moved to pull the thing back inside.

It bit her. On instinct, her fingers flew open. 

“Um. Whoops.”

The hitchhiker bellowed in pure agony and tore one last time at the chain. It shattered, metal pieces shooting every direction. The new mother flung open the door then threw herself out into the road. 

In the rearview we watched as two shapes tumbled across the pavement.

Autumn and I were silent.

I coughed. “Okay. Well. That was…”

“I hated that.”

“Yep.”



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



We drove another five minutes before finally rolling to a stop. The whole drive, Autumn stayed silent.

“We were right,” I said. “The hitchhikers did know the secret.”

“And so do I.”

“This is great. That’s why it’s never worked to get humans out before. It doesn’t matter if they’re in the trailer. They’ve always gone *willingly.*” Whereas impossibilities are forced. Even the crying thing must have been physically restrained onto the road. “All we have to do is force people like Tiff to go with us. We can trick them. As long as they don’t know how it works, they won’t want to try again. This is great. This is…”

My excitement faded.

Autumn. She was crying. I registered what she’d just said.

“I know,” she said again. “I know.”

The others, Chris and Tiff and all of them, they wouldn't want to try escaping. They’d tried before and it hadn't worked, which meant they *wouldn’t* be willing. We could fool them. Force them. They knew it wouldn’t work, which would be the thing that made it do just that.

Autumn knew. No matter what we tried, even if I tied her up and physically carried her, she would still understand what was happening. Some part of her would still be willing.

She held her hand to her mouth and cried silently.

We’d done it. We’d finally figured out the secret of lane-locking. The others could leave.

[Autumn couldn’t.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/)
