I never believed in the supernatural. Ghosts, demons, curses—they were the stuff of late-night TV and childhood dares. That was until I moved to Somerton, a quaint little town perched at the edge of an ancient forest. The town was charming enough, with its cobblestone streets and cozy cafés, but the locals warned me about one thing: Somerton Hill.

“It’s just an old superstition,” I laughed when Mrs. Parker from the bakery told me to steer clear of the hill. Her wrinkled hands trembled as she handed me a loaf of sourdough.

“Stay away,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “Especially at night.”

Of course, I didn’t listen. How could I? I was new, curious, and far too skeptical for my own good. The idea that a simple hill could hold any danger seemed laughable. So when my friend Clara visited a few weeks later, I suggested we hike up Somerton Hill. It was a crisp autumn afternoon, the kind where the air is alive with the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke. Perfect hiking weather.

The trail started innocently enough, winding gently through groves of maple and oak. Clara and I joked about the town’s warnings, making up ridiculous ghost stories as we climbed. But as we neared the summit, the atmosphere began to change.

The trees grew denser, their gnarled branches twisting together like skeletal fingers. The sunlight dimmed, even though the sky above was clear. And then there was the silence—no birds, no rustling leaves, just an oppressive stillness that pressed against my chest.

“Do you feel that?” Clara asked, her voice unusually small.

I nodded. I felt it too. A strange, vibrating tension in the air, like the world itself was holding its breath.

At the top of the hill stood an old stone circle, weathered and moss-covered, its origins long forgotten. The stones formed a perfect ring, and in the center was a patch of blackened earth, as if nothing could grow there. The sight was unsettling, but neither of us wanted to admit it.

“Looks like a great place for a séance,” Clara joked, though her laugh was hollow.

“Or a sacrificial altar,” I added, trying to keep the mood light.

We lingered for a moment, taking photos and poking fun at our own unease. Then the sun began to dip below the horizon, and the shadows lengthened.

“We should head back,” Clara said, glancing at her watch. “It’s getting late.”

I agreed, but as we turned to leave, something caught my eye—a figure standing at the edge of the tree line. It was too far away to make out details, but its silhouette was sharp against the twilight. Clara noticed it too.

“Who the hell is that?” she whispered.

The figure didn’t move. It just stood there, watching.

We quickened our pace, trying to put distance between ourselves and whoever—or whatever—was out there. But the further we walked, the more it felt like we were being followed. Shadows shifted unnaturally in the corners of my vision, and the sound of footsteps echoed faintly behind us, though when we stopped, the silence returned.

It wasn’t until we were halfway down the hill that we saw them—hundreds of figures, standing motionless among the trees. Their shapes were indistinct, like smudges of darkness that seemed to swallow the fading light. My heart pounded as Clara grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin.

“Run,” she gasped.

We bolted, careening down the trail, branches whipping at our faces. The figures didn’t chase us—they didn’t need to. Their presence was enough to drive us into a blind panic. I stumbled and fell, the rough ground scraping my palms. Clara yanked me to my feet, and we kept running until we burst out of the forest, gasping for air.

Back in the safety of my apartment, we tried to make sense of what we’d seen. Clara insisted we call the police, but what could we say? That we were scared by shadows? We eventually convinced ourselves it was a trick of the light, a shared hallucination brought on by our nerves.

But then the dreams started.

Every night, I found myself back on Somerton Hill, surrounded by those shadowy figures. They whispered in a language I couldn’t understand, their voices a low, droning hum that wormed its way into my skull. And always, at the center of the stone circle, was a figure larger than the rest, its eyes glowing faintly in the dark.

Clara had the dreams too. She stopped answering my calls after a week. Her roommate told me she’d locked herself in her room, muttering about “the eyes” and “the circle.” When I finally went to check on her, I found her apartment empty. The police called it a missing person’s case, but I knew better.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of whispering. The air in my room was ice-cold, and the shadows on the walls seemed to writhe and shift. I turned on the light, but it didn’t help—the shadows were still there, darker and deeper than they should have been.

And then I heard it: a faint knock at my window.

I live on the third floor.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. The shadows are everywhere now. They follow me in reflections, linger at the edges of every room. I’ve stopped sleeping, stopped leaving the apartment. I know it’s only a matter of time before they take me too.

If you ever visit Somerton, heed the warnings. Stay away from the hill. Don’t go near the stones. And whatever you do, don’t let the shadows see you.

They never forget.
