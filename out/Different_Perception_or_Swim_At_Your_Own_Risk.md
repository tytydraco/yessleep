The following is bit of a transcript in a phone call

Somewhere In a normal nuclear family's home in the United States of America. Two girls Olivia and Emma are on the phone. Talking to each other. 

Olivia: Hello?

(There's a pause in communication)

"ksiR nwO ruoY tA miwS"

Olivia: Hello?

(Another Pause)

Olivia: Did you know
That each person you know
Has a different perception of who you are?

Emma: Hello there Olivia 
And i didn't quite know that

Olivia: What's your perception of me?

Emma: I'm so delighted you asked. I think that you're a ..........................................................................

Olivia: Why thank you Emma, that means the world to me. 

Emma: You're very welcome Olivia 

Olivia: May I ask by chance Emma 

Emma: Yes Olivia

Olivia: Whatever did happen to Angie?

Emma: Angie?

Angie: I'm Here (showing a clip of the fire pit)

Olivia: I Haven't seen her since the bonfire at the Smith's house.

Emma: Wasn't she with her Boyfriend Liam?

Olivia: Yes they were both touching each other all over. And kissing. And touching. And kissing. And Touching. And Kiâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦

Liam (frantically running down some country road): Angie? Angie? ANGIE? ANGIE???

Emma: She's such a .... 

Olivia: I know Emma. But after that night, she's been gone. 

Emma: Gone With The Wind?

Olivia: Gone With The Wind.

Emma: Where do you think she could've gone to?

Olivia: Maybe she met a guy and ran away to Montague

Emma: But wouldn't she have left a note to let everyone know?

Olivia: Then people would find her and bring her back home.

Emma: What other options could there possibly be?

Olivia: Maybe they took too many lugs and rammed into a Tree. 

Emma: Then Where Are the Bodies? 

Olivia: They were probably moved. Or they couldn't be identified because their bodies were too bruised. 

Emma: That just doesn't add up with that story at all

Olivia: Maybe they drove too fast and found a cliff and then took a very big fall

Emma: There aren't cliffs around here.

Olivia: Well In a plane they flew over and they fell while they were driving round the white cliffs of Dover.

Emma: Angie could barely afford a quarter stick of gum

Olivia: Well um. Well um. Well um. Well um. Well um. Well um. Well um. Well um.

Emma: Do you think Liam did something with Angie?

Olivia: Like What Emma?

Emma: Like throw her in the firepit?

Olivia: The Firepit?

Emma: The Firepit

Olivia: That can't be possible. Because they left before the rest of us. If he did, all of us would've seen, and we would've all been thrown in the firepit too.

Emma: Why yes, that's very true. Well maybe he dumped her in a pool of Acid?

Olivia: A Pool of Acid?

Emma: Yes a Pool Of Acid.

Olivia: Maybe, but where could Liam ever get a pool of Acid.

Emma: Maybe he broke into a nuclear power plant and stole it. 

Olivia: Now don't be silly now. ðŸ˜œ

Emma: Maybe he threw her into the river?

Olivia: Into the River?

Emma: Of Course Into the River

Olivia: Well yes, of course Angie is at the bottom of the river. But it wasn't Liam who threw her in.

(In comes silence)

Emma: Did she Jump In?

Olivia: No. It Wasn't a Sucide.

Emma:  Then if it wasn't Liam who threw her in?

Olivia: Did you know that each person you know has a different perception of who you are?

"These Rivers Are Very Dangerous."

Olivia: What's your perception of me Emma?

"So Swim At Your Own Risk."

Emma: I'm so delighted you asked. I think that you're a danger to me and everyone around me. Especially after what happened to Angie. 

"There Have Been So Many Bodies Found In This River Its Surreal."

Emma: I have fond memories of being you and Liam and Angie in that truck. 

"Just Yesterday We Pulled Out 3 Bodies."

Emma: We pulled over by the river and stabbed them each 20 times

"Those were the bodies of Angie Leonard"

Emma: Why did you do it? I thought we were friends. Why did you kill me? I thought we planned to split the money we stole. But now you get the whole pizza. And I'm in this river all alone. Why did you do this to me Olivia? Why did youâ€¦


Olivia hangs up and continues on with her day. A blank look on her face. 


The end.
