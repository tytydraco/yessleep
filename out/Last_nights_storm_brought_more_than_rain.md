I pulled back the lace curtains of my bedroom window, scanning the destruction with a sigh. The violent thunderstorm from the previous night had left trees bent and broken, their branches littering the once tidy lawn. The old shed, its roof missing several shingles, stood like a wounded soldier in the corner of the yard. The wrought-iron fence, normally a symbol of order and security, now looked fragile amidst the chaos.

Stepping outside, I felt the dampness of the morning air seep through my nightgown as I bent to gather the fallen debris. I moved slowly, every action feeling tentative.

*Alone*, I thought, the single word forming a disturbingly complete sentence. *I am alone*.

As I reached for a particularly large branch near the shed, something caught my eye—a small, fallen bird’s nest among the debris. My heart sank as I saw the tiny, lifeless white baby birds, their fragile forms stark against the rough wood and dark leaves. The sight filled me with an inexplicable dread, a foreboding sense that the storm had brought more than just physical damage to my isolated cottage.

As I considered burying the baby birds, a thick mist began to creep in from the ocean, curling around the tree trunks and swallowing the edges of my yard. The air grew colder, sending a shiver down my spine. I bent down to pick up the nest, but before my fingers could close around it, a streak of white flashed before my eyes. Startled, I heard a loud, piercing caw. A large white bird, its red eyes glowing with malevolent intent, swooped at my face, its wings slicing through the thickening fog with a violent force. I ducked, my heart pounding, trying to get a better look at my attacker. For a moment, the wild thought that the bird had summoned the fog, that it was one with the suffocating white blanket, crossed my mind. Fear surged through me, and I stumbled backward, fleeing into the relative safety of my cottage, the crow's eerie cries following me. Again and again, the crow swooped and flew at me as I ran, its caws echoing ominously through the mist-shrouded morning.

Once I was inside, I leaned against the door, breathing heavily. The encounter with the bird had left me shaken, but I resolved to start my morning as I usually did. I put on the kettle to make a cup of tea, hoping the familiar routine would calm my nerves. As a historian, I was deeply immersed in writing a biography of the women who had once owned this house, the Fenwood sisters. Their diaries and letters were a treasure trove of information, and living in their abandoned home allowed me to experience their world more intimately.

Unbidden, thoughts of Rachel, my ex, drifted into my mind. She had initially accompanied me to Fenwood Cottage, just as excited as I was to live in the strange old house by the sea. Over time, she had become increasingly frightened of the isolation that life at Fenwood required. Little tiffs turned into arguments, which turned into fights, which then turned into even bigger fights, and, finally, the last fight, the one that had left me in this eerie place alone.

I checked my phone and noted with alarm that the storm had disrupted cell service. My stomach dropped as I glanced at my router, sighing over the blinking orange light. No phone and no internet meant that my power had probably been knocked out as well. Fortunately, my backup generator would have kicked in, providing me with power, but it seemed that I was cut off from the outside world. It usually took a few days for services to be restored after a storm in this remote area. The idea of being so isolated unnerved me. I considered getting in my old Jeep and braving the road into town, but the thought of fallen trees blocking the way made me hesitate.

*Alone*, I thought, the word echoing in my mind again. *I am alone*. The silence in the cottage felt heavier than usual, filled with the ominous presence of the mist and the lingering dread from the bird's attack. The isolation that had once been a boon for my scholarly work now felt like a suffocating shroud, wrapping tighter with each passing moment.

After getting dressed, I considered my next moves. Braving the road to town felt as tempting as ever, as I felt sure that a simple glimpse of the friendly teenager behind the counter in the coffee shop or the kind, elderly man who managed the small grocery store would somehow put me at ease. A highly reserved person by nature, I depended on minute interactions that most people took for granted to help keep me tethered to the world, and to some sense of belonging and humanity. Alone, with the cottage shrouded in fog, I felt dangerously at risk of drifting away for good. Some instinct stirred in my reptile brain and deep in my belly, urging me to pick up my keys, to head to the Jeep.

My desire to see another human, any human at all, struggled against my worries about debris on the road and my fear of the white crow. I wondered if the creature was still outside, and if I would be safe if I ventured out. The thought of the ghostly bird and its cold, red eyes was sufficient to chill any thoughts of seeking comfort in town. Deciding that remaining in the safety of the cottage and waiting for my digital connections to the outside to be restored was best, I resigned myself to continuing my work.

Sighing, I made my way up to the attic, the creaky wooden ladder groaning under my weight, to gather another round of the Fenwood sisters’ documents for transcription. Climbing the rickety ladder felt like ascending into another world, one preserved in time, where every creak of the wood underfoot was a reminder of the house’s ancient secrets. When I reached the top, I carefully maneuvered around the piles of forgotten treasures and old furniture, focusing on the task at hand. It was a dusty, old, and cluttered space, filled with the scent of aged paper and rotting wood. A single, strange window with panels of blue and green stained glass cast an eerie light on yellowed papers strewn across broken, abandoned furnishings.

Returning to my work area, I placed the latest batch of documents beside an old trunk with bundles of yellowed papers. Then, without warning, the white crow suddenly appeared at the window, cawing loudly and pecking at the glass with its sharp beak. The bird fixed a single red eye on me, gazing into me with a strange force that made me shudder. Then, as soon as it had appeared, it was gone again, gliding away into the fog with a triumphant caw.

The force of the bird’s assault had chipped the old glass, and I stared at the chip, feeling as though the house and my work were beginning to chip away at me. As I tried to steady my nerves, my eyes were drawn to a slender journal with a cracked black leather cover that I had never noticed before. Picking it up, I was pleased to see the name Attica Fenwood stamped on the front. I had plenty of journals and diaries written by Esther Fenwood but very little from her sister Attica, aside from a few letters. Deciding that going through Attica’s journal and transcribing it would be my work for the morning, I felt a mixture of excitement and unease. As I descended, taking care with my footing on the rickety ladder, I wondered why I had never seen that specific journal before. Such a treasure surely would have stood out to me. Finding the mystery unsolvable, however, I proceeded towards my desk with a shrug, attempting to release my worries and growing sense of unease.

Sitting down with Attica Fenwood's journal, I carefully opened the cracked black leather cover, the scent of old paper and ink enveloping me. The handwriting was elegant, the script of an educated woman from another era. As I read, the story of the Fenwood sisters began to unfold in Attica's own words.

 

**August 14, 1893**

The solitude of our life here in this remote place has long weighed heavy upon my heart. Esther, my dear sister, has always been my stalwart companion, but there are desires and longings that even her company cannot fulfill. For many years, I have dreamt of the one thing I believed would never be mine—children. The isolation of our home and the peculiarities of our existence made such dreams seem impossible, yet the heart cannot be governed by logic alone.

Desperation led me to delve deeper into the old tomes of our family, seeking answers and perhaps a way to bend reality to my will. Among the ancient texts, I found a spell, an incantation that promised to grant me my heart's deepest desire. With the moon high and full in the sky, casting an ethereal glow over our secluded estate, I performed the ritual with trembling hands and whispered words of power. I cannot yet say what the results of my perhaps foolish doings shall be. I will write again and record what occurs, come what may.

 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I startled, raising my eyes and nearly dropping Attica’s journal. The white bird was perched outside my window, considering me with something very much like derision, if birds are capable of such an expression at all. The fog still swirled outside, casting the ghostly bird in dim, silvery hues that made it hard for me to understand its true nature at first. I wondered at its red eyes, intelligent and bright, and took in the characteristic contours of its beak.

“You are a crow,” I whispered. “A very unusual crow.” I had never seen an albino example of the species before, but that was surely what I was looking at now. I had befriended crows before at the university, exchanging peanuts for their goodwill. This white cousin, however, seemed to feel nothing but hatred for me.

“Shoo,” I spoke, surprised by how quiet and powerless my voice was in the still, heavy air. The bird, of course, did not obey and continued to sit on the windowsill, staring in through the glass. I pulled the curtains, relieving myself of the unsettling sight and returning to Attica’s journal.

 

**August 30, 1893**

To my astonishment and delight, the spell was successful! The darlings of my heart, already more dear to me than you may imagine, appeared before me on my morning stroll. Their skin is as white as alabaster and their precious eyes seem to hold the very secrets of the universe. I named my sweet girl Lily, after the flower variety in the same delicate hue, a bloom nearly as beautiful as my daughter is. I chose Rowan for my handsome boy, for he will be our protector and carry all the strength and magic of his namesake. Though Esther finds their appearance unsettling, I felt a fierce and protective love for them from the first, as though they had always been my own. But Esther, dear, rational Esther, is horrified by their otherworldly presence. She insisted that they are not natural, that they are abominations summoned from realms beyond our understanding, and that they must be sent back to the realm from which they came.

 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Releasing a frustrated sigh, I set the journal carefully on the desk and returned to the window, twitching the curtain aside. The white crow’s steady, red gaze met my own as soon as the curtain parted, the creature staring at me with stalwart insistence.

“I am sorry for your babies,” I said quietly. “I would have laid them to rest, had you let me.”

As though in response, the bird tapped gently on the glass. “What is it that you want?” I questioned.

The strange creature offered no response but merely stared, looking frightened and forlorn.

“I’m afraid I cannot think how to help you, poor creature,” I mused, wondering at myself for conversing so long with the animal and assigning it feelings that could not possibly be real.

“Go on to someplace nicer, and let me work.”

As though agreeing, the white crow turned and hopped onto the ground. I watched it fly into the mist and pulled the curtain shut with a sense of relief, hoping that I could continue reading Attica’s journal in peace.

 

**October 11, 1893**

In her fear and revulsion, Esther took the children up to the attic, where she believed they could cause no harm. It was there, in the darkest hours of the night, that she did the unthinkable—she pushed them through the attic window, casting them out into the night. My screams of anguish filled the house, but it was too late. The children were gone, and with them, my heart was shattered. Blinded by grief and rage, I cursed Esther, my once beloved sister. The words flowed from me with a power I scarcely understood, binding her fate to the darkness she had wrought. The details of what transpired next are a blur, lost in the haze of my sorrow. All that remains is a deep and abiding sense of loss, and the knowledge that our bond was forever broken.

 

As I closed the journal, I felt a chill run down my spine. The room seemed to grow colder, the air thick with a sense of foreboding. Attica's tale was one of love, loss, and the dark consequences of meddling with forces beyond comprehension. I couldn’t help but wonder what other secrets the Fenwood sisters had left behind in this cursed house and eagerly turned back to the journal.

 

**October 16, 1893**

Never have I felt so alone in all my years on this dismal plane. Is my dear sister Esther truly gone from me? Has my curse done its work? I cannot understand even my own thinking and doings, not anymore. Time moves along its own strange course, the sense and sunshine of days past long gone. I saw the children playing on the lawn today, frolicking sweetly as they once did and laughing over their little secrets, the secrets amongst twins. Their deep eyes beckon to me, but I know that my children are dead. As soon as I remember, the precious apparitions leave me as swiftly as they came. How am I to traverse this strange, new life? The paths do not lead anywhere, anymore. All roads lead back to Fenwood, now, but there is no one left at this cursed place, no one but me. What can it mean?

 

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I dropped the journal, a strange chill seizing at my heart. *The bird*, I thought, approaching the window, *it’s only the bird*.

I pulled the curtain back swiftly with tremulous hands, and the sight that met my eyes sent me stumbling backward in terror. Two children stood at the window, scraggly hair framing smiling, weathered faces with pale lips pressed tightly closed, their wide, dark eyes gazing through me. They laughed the laughter of insanity and cold, the unnatural sound tinkling like a distant, hellish bell, before turning and running into the yard, into the mist. I forced myself to watch as they ran towards the shed, their distant, gray-clad forms almost invisible through the fog as they disappeared into the tiny building. 

Dusk settled over the cottage, shrouding the world in a twilit gloom that mirrored my growing dread. I debated going outside to investigate, trying to make a run for the Jeep, or staying inside and waiting for help to come. Unable to see the children anymore, I decided to get brave and go out, not sure what I was going to do, but clutching my keys and a fire poker in hand.

I approached the Jeep first, my heart pounding in my chest. I noticed that the tires had been punctured by something sharp and jagged—all completely flat. My hope for escape dwindled rapidly. Suddenly, a light appeared in my peripheral vision, drawing my eyes up to the shed. I moved closer, and as the mist cleared enough and I got nearer, I saw the children silhouetted in the shed’s dirty window, smiling wide and revealing massive, horsey teeth. One raised a hand to show sharp, bird-like talons where fingers should be in a horrifying parody of a wave. Paralyzed with fear, I saw a larger silhouette stirring behind the children, approaching the window.

I’d seen enough.  Panicked, I fled back to the cottage, stumbling and crying through the mist.  Once inside, I bolted the door and collapsed against it, my breaths coming in ragged gasps. The cottage, once my sanctuary, now felt like a prison, trapping me with whatever sinister presence had descended on my home.

My only remaining hope is to survive the night and prat that help will come before it is too late.  I’m currently barricaded in the cottage sitting at my desk, my fingers trembling as I type out the harrowing events of the day. The power is flickering on and off, casting eerie shadows that dance across the walls, no doubt the work of the evil forces lurking outside.  I now fear that the same malevolent presence that had punctured my tires might soon destroy my generator too, extinguishing my final source of light and warmth. I dare not venture out into the night.  As I pour my fears onto the screen, a single, desperate thought anchors my resolve: if the worst should happen, if I do not survive, perhaps someone, somewhere, will one day find my story and understand the terror that has befallen me in this cursed place.
