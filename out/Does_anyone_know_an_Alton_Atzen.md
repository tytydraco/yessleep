So I'm on holiday with my friends at the moment. I'm not going to say exactly where we are, but for context it's somewhere in the northeastern united states. One of my friends' relative owns this massive house in a nice place that they rent out in the summer, and we were able to finagle some nice family rates, so we all headed over. The house was huge, built on a slope with a big wooden patio outside the front door, and a switchback ramp leading up to it. I say this because it will be relevant later, and also because it goes to show that this was a seemimgly nice, safe area. Something which makes what happened all the more unsettling to me.

We all decided on a rota for chores, and today mine was to go and get groceries for the house. Normally, somebody else would come with whoever was sent just for company, but we had been drinking the night before and I was by far the least hungover, so it was just me on my own. I didn't really mind, though. I've always been a kinda quiet person, and it was only about a ten minute walk through some nice scenery in the fresh morning air, so I was actually enjoying it. 

I got the groceries without incident and was almost finished with my return journey. Our house was only about 100 feet away on my left when a door on my right burst open and startled me to stillness. An older man in a pinstripe suit came stumbling out, yelling at the ground and holding the end of a balloon closed in his hand. I was so shocked at how his voice sounded that I barely registered what he had actually been saying. His voice sounded like it was on helium, which I guess is why he had the balloon with him, and he had been yelling something like "that's it, don't come back here again!!" before he looked up from the ground and saw me.

His face broke into a huge smile, revealing blindingly white teeth shining out from within his thick grey beard. He released the balloon, which went flying around in crazy circles making that escaping gas sound. He scratched his head with this strange, stiff motion that made me think of a cartoon robot. He did all of this while slightly stooped over, head turned up towards me, beaming at me. Eventually, when the balloon had stopped it's noise and utter silence had fallen on the street, he took a step forward and began to speak.

"Hi there, my name is Alton Atzen, what might you be called?" he called in a jolly tone.
I was struck by how utterly bizarre this all was. His voice still held the high pitch of the helium, and he spoke in a theatrical manner, like this was all part of some sort of act that required audience participation. I reluctantly told him my name because I couldn't think of a way to politely decline and lying didn't cross my mind. I tried to say that I had to be getting back, but he cut me off.

"I had a man, I was gonna go on a trip, see, he said he was gonna drive me to Toronto. I couldn't be drivin' myself now, I'm much too old."
He paused and stared at me like he was waiting for me to say something. I broke free of my growing fear to rise to the occasion of a potentially normal social interaction, so I started with a "I'm very sorry", but he cut me off again the second I started talking.
"Wouldn't you drive me? You seem like you'd manage just fine, someone of your age. And I'd pay! and not just in my wonderful company." He managed, before breaking into a full on fit of giggles, accentuated by the helium.

This time words came quickly to me, I told him that it was a nice offer but I wasn't able to, but thanks anyways. Something like that. At this point I was getting really disturbed and my fight our flight response was practically beating me over the head with a stick. I began taking steps backwards and to my left, inching my way towards the house. Alton noticed this and began slowly stepping forward and to his right, while maintaining his happy demeanor. 

He kept talking, trying to convince me, saying things like "Aw, come on, help an old man out?, it'd be the adventure of a lifetime, why don't you come on in and we can talk about it a bit more?" Stuff like that. I wasn't really listening at that point, but I was so terrified of him suddenly breaking and running towards me that I tried my best to keep the friendly pretext of the conversation up, hoping that this would keep the obvious fact; that I was trying to get away and he was trying to cut me off, from being addressed. I asked things like "who was going to drive you? What was his name? Why did he cancel?" All while forcing a smile. He would always answer the same. "Oh, I can't remember" and then he'd go right back to trying to convince me. As he did this, I noticed the helium wearing off and his voice getting deeper and deeper by the second.

I reached the ramp and walking sideways towards the first switch back, making sure to keep my eyes on him. As I reached it and changed directions, he stepped up onto the bottom and began following me, this was absolutely out of the realm of acceptable behaviour now, and I could no longer at all deny that he was definitely coming after me, but we kept the friendly back and forth up. I continued up the ramp, and he followed me further and further up.  As I neared the top he threw his arms up, seemingly exasperated. His now almost frighteningly deep voiced denounced me and protested my lack of common decency towards an old man, but I didn't focus on the words. As his jacket moved aside, my eyes were drawn to the light being reflected off of the fancy pearl handle sticking out of his waistband. The handle of a knife.

I turned as fast as I could, dropping the groceries, and sprinted for the door, I heard him giving chase behind me, calling out in a deep bass tone, but I slammed through the doors and had them closed and locked behind me before he reached them. My friends heard this and gathered around. Surprisingly, nobody made any sort of jokes or digs. They could clearly see something pretty serious had happened, and they listened intently as I told them the story. 

After this we all opened the door, after trying to peep through the windows to see if anyone was there, and had a look around. There was nothing except the bag of groceries I had dropped, from which we salvaged what we could. We decided that he had probably been some sort of predator, and called the police to report it. They arrived and took my statement, which I gave while watching the squad car pull up to the house the man had come from, two officers walk in. 

As the officer who took my statement walked away I heard something I couldn't understand, police codes, but there was also something I could pick up on. Fear. The officer calling this in was clearly distressed. I went back inside with my friend as more police pulled up, along with two ambulances. I didn't have the stomach to watch any longer, so I dragged myself to an armchair by the fire and sat down. I let my head loll to the side as I thought back on the events of the day. Eventually my thoughts wandered back into reality, and that's when I saw it. On the bookshelf right next to my head, a number of old books, at least ten that I could see right then, all bearing the same name. Alton Atzen. I grabbed the nearest book in a panic and turned it over. Taking up most of the back page was a large black and white photo of the author. The same man I had seen today.

I felt sick when I saw that. I still do. I don't know what to make of this at all, but I'm going to go through these books. My curiosity is just too strong. As terrifying as today was, I really can't resist a mystery.
