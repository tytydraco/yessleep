I first met Sam the night I landed in Cairo. I was at the hotel bar, brooding. My flight was delayed, and it caused me to miss the expedition-sponsored trip to the Egyptian Museum. The old-fashioned I ordered with my dinner was good, so I ordered another to keep me company. As I sat there, sipping my drink, I pulled a hardcover notebook from my pocket and wrote “Egypt” on the cover. The spine cracked as I opened it the first time and stared at the blank inside cover. Alcohol failed to numb the bitterness as I scribbled the same words written in all my field notebooks: “For Her.” The routine brought back memories, not all of them good. I sighed and gestured to the barkeep for another drink. Turning to the first blank page, I busied sketching pyramids, obelisks, and what I assured myself really did resemble a camel.

Sam’s voice tipped me off to the fact that I was no longer alone at the bar. Sometimes, I still think about the way her blue eyes glimmered when she looked at me the first time, or the way her red hair fell over her pale, round shoulders, but I don’t think I’ll ever forget her smile. Sam was self-conscious about her canine teeth. She later confided in me that she thought they were too big. Introducing myself, I was met with the small, tight-lipped grin reserved for polite conversations with strangers. I didn’t expect our small talk to go anywhere, but as it turned out, she was an Egyptology student at the hotel for the Wadi Hamra expedition briefing. We quickly discovered we had a lot more to talk about, past excavations we’d worked on, our colleges, the difference between Egyptology and archaeology. Before we said goodnight that evening, she graced me with one of her genuine, too-big smiles. One where the corners of her mouth were drawn wide by the mildly oversized canines and crow’s feet wrinkled from the corners of her eyes. There was an unspoken, heartfelt sincerity in this expression that fascinated me. Since leaving Cairo for the desert, she smiled like this more often, especially near me.

Sam wasn’t smiling now. She lay motionless on a cot in the communications tent, giving the occasional whimper as she stirred. The stinger left behind a black scab, surrounded by a dark bruise creeping up her wrist. It looked like she was wearing a glove, several sizes too big. Anti-inflammatories did little for the swelling, but it was all our nurse, Elaine, could do. I stayed by her side, answering the occasional question from Elaine. I was filling out an incident report when Felix entered the tent, holding up the crushed body of the scorpion. Even dead inside a plastic bag, it unsettled me.

“It’s just as we thought: an Egyptian Black Scorpion. They’re common to this region. I wouldn’t doubt more of them are lurking around out there. Good job getting it before it got away, Derrick.”

Elaine frowned as our Project Supervisor dropped the lifeless thing on the computer table beside heaps of paper.

“If that’s the case, would you please make an announcement to the rest of the team? We don’t have an abundance of medication, or antivenom for that matter.”

“We’ve already briefed the team about the dangers posed by wildlife on site. Anyway, these stings are rarely fatal in adults.”

“Is Sam going to be alright?” I asked.

“She isn’t going to lose her hand if that’s what you mean, but there is always a chance of neurological damage or infection. I spoke with James, and he thought Sam should be taken off-site for medical treatment. We have a MEDEVAC on standby in-”

“Like bloody hell I’m letting them send me home over a swollen hand,” Sam said, her voice heavy with medical-induced drowsiness as she stirred. Elaine rose from her seat and stood by Sam, gesturing for her to lie down.

“Lie still. You need to rest.”

“I’ll rest when I feel like it.” The light returned to Sam’s eyes. She struggled to sit, and I helped pull her upright. “What’s this about me being taken to hospital?”

“Nothing has been decided yet,” Felix said, stepping around the cot to Elaine’s side. “But it’s a contingency in the event you don’t show signs of improvement.”

“It’s absurd if you ask me. I feel fine. You can’t send me away, not when we’re days, perhaps hours from opening the mummy’s chamber!”

“It might not come to that. If you wish, Samantha, I can include you’re desire to remain on site in my report.”

“I’d quite like that,” Sam huffed. She crossed her arms, but winced in pain as she bumped her swollen hand. She fussed over the injury, trying to find a comfortable position for her wrist before giving up and resting it back on the cot. After a few words to Elaine, Felix left to write his report.

“How long have I been passed out?” Sam asked. “What time is it?”

“Only a couple of hours,” Elaine interrupted, taking Sam’s pulse. “Really, Samantha, you need rest. Try not to worry about being sent off-site.”

Sam sighed in defeat as Elaine returned to the computer. It was then that she turned to me.

“Have you been sat here with me this whole time?”  I nodded.

“How sweet of you.” A small grin worked its way across her face for the first time since she woke up.

“I’m just glad you’re alright,” I said, feeling the color rise to my face.

“Oh, I’m fine, just a bit sore really. Do you still fancy having a look at my notes with me? It seems I’ll be stuck here for some time.”

“I’d like that, if they weren’t still inside the tomb.”

“What?” Sam frowned. “What do you mean you left them back at the tomb?”

“You needed immediate medical attention. The notebook seemed trivial.”

“Trivial indeed.” Sam rolled her eyes. “Those notes might be the last contribution I make to this expedition.”

“You’re being a bit dramatic, don’t you think?”

“Perhaps,” Sam sighed. “Well, would you mind terribly going back for them? I’d like something to occupy me while I’m sat here, awaiting my fate.”

I looked over to Elaine, as if asking permission.

“Just be careful,” she shrugged before going back to her report. “I don’t need any more scorpion stings to deal with.”

The oppressive afternoon sun had long since vanished over the cliffs surrounding the valley; only a thin yellow ribbon of its light remained. Shadows painted our camp in shades of blue and purple as I walked back to the tomb. Somehow, these colors failed to illuminate the narrow stairway leading to its entrance. I felt a chill standing outside the threshold to the antechamber and tried summoning some of the enthusiasm Sam and I felt that morning. Snapping on my headlamp, I steeled my resolve and took the first step into the dark chamber. The place was eerily quiet; the only sounds were the clopping of my boots and echoes of my breath as I advanced up the sloping corridor. I made a conscious effort not to focus on the mosaics along the way. I wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but Sam was right about the tomb being creepy, and images of mummification, death, and watery graves still fresh in my mind were making it worse. Giving my imagination license to run free was the last thing I needed.

Entering the chapel, once more, I left the work lights off. I intentionally left the generator off before going back inside the tomb. I did this partly because I already had a rough idea where Sam dropped her notebook, but I had an ulterior motive. I needed to know if what I thought I saw inside the serdab was real. The rational part of my mind struggled to find an explanation for the Ka statue’s glowing red eyes. Maybe the rock was painted with something reflective, or the artisan set gemstones into the eye sockets. Whatever the case, I had to know.

I found the notebook easily enough. It was splayed open on the floor, near the wet outline left by the smashed scorpion. I picked it up and shook dust and sand from its pages, smoothing out the ones crumpled by its abrupt fall before shutting it.

I stared at the serdab for a long moment before I approached it. I could have comfortably rested my chin on its bottom ledge, but thoughts of another scorpion lurking within crept into the back of my mind. I kept my distance and struggled to meet the gaze of the dark statue. Sam’s efforts to clean the interior of the serdab gave a much better view of the figure inside. Some of the finer points of ancient Egyptian art were probably lost on me, but the proportions seemed clumsier than other examples I’d seen in books and museums. It lacked the graceful, slender quality I’d anticipated. Instead, the statue squatting on its haunches before me was stockier. Looking at the black stone, I studied its lion face, sneering lips, and long fangs. Sam said it was meant to represent whoever was buried in the tomb, but the statue holding my gaze wasn’t even human. I wondered if it was meant to be a symbolic representation, rather than a physical one, although I couldn’t imagine who would want to be compared to the sinister thing before me. The eyes looked to be carved from the same black stone as the rest of the small statue. However, playing my headlamp over its face revealed a certain lustrous quality. It seemed oddly life-like, as though it might pounce from its perch at any moment. Absurd as this notion was, it unsettled me enough that I backed away.

Darkness washed over the Ka statue once more as my light receded, yet its eyes still managed to catch some of the light, reflecting it back from several paces away. Any thoughts of investigating further evaporated when a rough hand caught my shoulder. I shouted in surprise as it jerked me around. James stood in front of me, a scowl on his face.

“I thought I made myself perfectly clear. No one is to be in this tomb unsupervised,” he shouted at me. I stood in dumb silence until his raised brow indicated he wanted some answer.

“I’m sorry, I must not have been there when you said that. I just came back to get Sam’s notebook. I was careful to watch out for any more scorpions. Back in the States we-”

“I don’t give a damn what you have back in the states. I’m the one leading this expedition. The last thing I need is another student archaeologist jeopardizing this excavation with their carelessness.”

“Sam wasn’t being careless,” I said, eyes narrowing. “She had an accident. It could have happened to anyone.” James rolled his eyes at this.

“I’ve seen more accidents from students playing summer camp in my time than I can count. Now get off my dig site before I have you join Sam on her way back to Cairo.”

I exchanged glares with James before taking the corridor out of the tomb. Anger welled inside me. I wanted to tell him exactly what I thought, but didn’t want to risk my place on the team.  “Join Sam on her way back to Cairo,” he said. Were they really going to send her away? Climbing the stairs from the tomb back to the valley, I tried doing a neater job smoothing out the pages of her notebook. It seemed innocent enough as I flattened the wrinkled pages, restoring their columns of copied hieroglyphs and diagrams. It never felt like snooping through something intimate like a diary, until I found the hand-drawn sketch of me, with a caption written in Hieratic script. I thought back to the night we met at the hotel bar, and the doodles in my own notebook. They were cartoonish compared to the likeness staring back at me in the dying light. I couldn’t read what Sam had written, but the drawing made me wonder if she looked at me as something more than just a friend. Trudging toward the quiet, glowing tents, I hoped she’d be able to stay with us, at least a bit longer. In all the time I’d known her, I never saw Sam angry, but I could hear her seething from outside the communications tent.

“There isn’t a bloody chance in hell I’m leaving this site, not when we’re so close to recovering the mummy. The experience I’ll have gained here will be invaluable for my studies.”

“I’m sorry, Samantha, I truly am. But the decision is quite out of my hands.” Ossendorf’s portly voice escaped from the satellite phone as Sam fumbled it in her non-dominant hand.  “The expedition’s financial backers, as well as the Ministry of Antiquities, have only your best interests at heart when suggesting you leave the site for medical treatment.”

“Sending their Project Officer to threaten sending me away is hardly ‘suggesting’ anything. Felix spoke to me just now as if James had everything decided. Am I to take it the waiver I signed was for nothing? Doesn’t my willingness to stay on for the duration of the project mean anything to them?”

“You will find all the documents you and the rest of the team signed have the full force of law, I assure you. I’m sure everyone concerned appreciates your dedication; however, the last thing any of us want is harm to come your way, especially when it's so preventable. Why risk it?”

“I don’t care what those prats at the Egyptological Society or anyone else has to say,” Sam Scowled. “I’m not a hindrance to anyone. It should be my right to stay. Can’t Elaine re-examine me in the morning and see how I’m getting on?” The tent fell silent as Ossendorf pondered this.

“I can’t make you any promises, but I’ll be glad to make that suggestion if you wish.”

Sam didn’t speak; she just stared silently at the gently billowing wall on the opposite side of the tent. Ossendorf went on.

“I’m sure this must be a great disappointment to you, but I assure you the powers that be have only your best interest at heart. Now, it’s getting quite late. Why don’t we talk again in the morning?”

Sam muttered a few half-hearted pleasantries and ended the call before tossing the phone to the foot of her cot. Hot tears streamed from her eyes as she slammed her good fist into her thigh.

“What rubbish,” she spat. Elaine rested a hand on Sam’s shoulder.

“There, there. Nothing’s been decided yet. You’ve already shown some signs of improvement. Maybe they’ll let you stay after I examine you tomorrow.”

“Oh? And would you make that recommendation if they ask?” Sam asked, raising a challenging eyebrow. Elaine sighed.

“If the swelling has gone down by morning and you don’t appear neurologically impaired in any way, yes, I will. Regardless, I will be voicing my honest opinion of your medical condition.” Elaine grabbed the satellite phone and went back to her seat at the computer.

“Oh, very well then.” Sam winced as she tried to cross her arms over her chest, but gave up when this became too painful and turned to face me. “Was your trip a success? No more scorpions, I hope?”

“No scorpions, but I might have run into something worse,” I said, holding her notebook in the air before handing it to her.

“Thank you so much,” Sam said with a sigh. “These might turn out to be my sole contribution after all.”

“You really believe that?”

“If James and those stupid investors have their way, I’ll be on the truck out of here tomorrow morning along with the first batch of artifacts,” Sam said with a shrug.

“Hopefully it won’t come to that,” Elaine said, turning in her seat to face us. “But for now, the best thing you can do to improve your odds of recovery is getting some rest.”

“Oh, fine, I’ll try. Even if I am feeling rather gutted about the whole thing. Can I at least spend tonight in my own tent?”

“There’s not much more I can do for you right now,” Elaine said with a sigh. “But if your swelling worsens or you have any other symptoms, I want you to let me know immediately.” She pulled two handheld radios from a charging dock and handed one to Sam. “I’m a light sleeper.”

Sam clasped the radio to her belt before sliding her legs over the side of the cot. I knelt down and helped her slip her boots on.

“Care to walk me back to my tent?” she asked, as I helped her to her feet.

Most of the team members were already asleep as we walked through the quiet camp. There was no fire that night, only the occasional glow from tents illuminated our path, along with the stars speckling the night sky. There was a pleasant chill to the air, and I couldn’t help wishing we had further to walk. Reality finally sank in that this could be Sam’s last night with us. I tried but failed to think of anything comforting to say.

“What was it you ended up running into?” She asked, giving me a sidelong glance. It took me a second to register what she was talking about.

“Oh. It was just James. He apparently saw me going into the tomb to get your notebook and wasn’t happy about it.” I wanted to tell her about him threatening to send me away from the valley along with her, but knew it wouldn’t make her feel any better.

“I’m sorry you had a run-in with him.”

“It’s alright,” I said. “I’m sure it won’t be the last time.”

We walked on in awkward silence. Neither of us were sure what to say. As her tent came into view, Sam spoke up.

“Derrick, I just wanted to say thank you.” She looked down, tucking a few stray hairs behind her ears. “For carrying me out of the tomb, and looking after me this evening, and going back for my notebook.” She gave a small smile.

“I’m just glad you’re alright.”

“I do wish I knew if I’ll be allowed to stay on,” Sam sighed.

“Do you really think they’ll make you leave? You don’t seem injured that badly.”

“Who knows?” Sam raised her good hand in defeat. “Elaine said I was coming along nicely enough while you were in the tomb, but whatever James told the higher-ups in his report has them all petrified for my well-being.”

I thought of James’ unfounded prejudice against the expedition’s less experienced members. I didn’t want to dash her hopes, but if the Project Officer wanted her sent back for medical treatment, she could be gone indefinitely. Possibly never to return for the rest of the dig. I frowned. Could tomorrow really be the last time I saw Sam? I didn’t have time to ponder it, as we stopped in front of her tent. We stood there, silent for a moment.

“I suppose this is goodnight,” Sam said, forcing a tight-lipped smile before looking to the ground.

“I’ll be sure to stop by and check on you in the morning.”

“You know, we never did end up watching Lawrence of Arabia on my laptop,” she remarked, as if not wanting our conversation to die.

“Yeah, we never got around to it, did we?”

“It’s not too late.” Her eyes rose to meet mine.

“Don’t you need to rest?”

“I don’t think it actually matters. Besides, T. E. Lawrence always cheers me up.”

That night, I found out “Lawrence of Arabia” is a great movie. It was, as Sam described it, a ‘cinematic experience.’ I’m not much of a movie buff, but I was impressed by the realistic props and detailed set pieces. The version Sam showed me was digitally remastered, but still retained that grainy charm from the film camera days.  Many scenes were shot on location, there were at least a thousand extras, and it went on to win seven academy awards.

I also learned it was nearly four hours long. At one point, while debating whether I should ask Sam if it was almost over, the intermission came on. It was a slog at times if I’m being honest. It had some awkward character interactions and felt oddly akin to some of the other 1960s sword-and-sandal epics, but I couldn’t bring myself to voice these criticisms, not in front of Sam. She was genuinely enthralled, spouting off facts about the movie as it played, even quoting her favorite scenes in time with Peter O’Toole. I don’t think that too-big smile left her face even once as we watched. Amusing as all this was, it did put me in the awkward position of having to traipse back to my own tent around two O’clock in the morning.

“Are you sure you don’t just want to stay the night here?” Sam asked from the edge of her cot, looking at me with her big eyes.

“I really ought to get back to my own tent.” I wanted to stay, but also didn’t want anyone to catch us both leaving the same tent in the morning. Sam gave me a sad smile before standing and closing the short space between us. The splint on her injured hand dug into my back as she wrapped me in a warm embrace. Her eyes met mine as I looked down. They looked even more blue in the light from her laptop screen. I kissed her. And she kissed me back.

“How long have you wanted to do that?” She asked, grinning up at me with her too-big smile.

“A while now.”

“I’m so glad you did.”

Sam gave me a small smile as I stepped outside her tent before zipping the door up. The moon wasn’t quite full, but it did a fair job illuminating the ring of tents that made up our camp. Maybe I was being paranoid, but I didn’t want to walk across the open expanse in the middle of camp, exposed to anyone who might be awake. Instead, I picked my way around the tents, being careful not to trip over any of their guy lines, and walked between the ring they formed and the dense thicket of trees and underbrush separating our camp from the cliffs to the south. When we first made camp, Jorge joked about Sam being afraid to pitch her tent near the tree line, but watching the black mass of thorned tree limbs and scrub brush sway in the moonlight, wondering all the while if a cobra was hidden amongst them made me more sympathetic.

At least three varieties of venomous snakes were native to the region. They were the main reason for the curfew I was breaking, but sightings were rare after we entered the valley and established camp near the dig site. They avoided us instinctively, and that was fine by me. Sam never missed an opportunity to tease me about my fear of snakes, not since I jolted in my seat during the safety briefing when the PowerPoint suddenly revealed three large snakes, coiled up on the screen.

I didn’t want to draw any attention to myself by using a flashlight. But try as I might, I couldn’t ignore the persistent fear of running into one of these dangerous reptiles, not noticing the light reflected from their eyes until it was too late. If there was one comfort, it was the sound of sleep drifting lazily from the tents I passed. It was reassuring that no one was awake to catch me skulking around camp past curfew, even if the only person who would care was James. I was almost back at my own tent when something stopped me dead in my tracks.

The yellow beam from a flashlight shined through the gap between the tent I stood behind and the next one. I crouched to the ground, trying to make myself small as it swept over the patch of sand I was about to step into. I held my breath as it played over the tent, wondering as it cast a silhouette of everything inside against the polyester, who was searching for me, and why? I’d been almost silent, sneaking back to my tent, and felt certain no one witnessed me go with Sam into hers. The light continued sweeping over the camp, never lingering on any one spot. The beam vanished from my sight before I mustered the courage to peek around the edge of the tent. It was coming from between the communications and dining tents. I didn’t think anything could scare me more than the searching spotlight until it went out and the person wielding it disappeared into the inky shadows between the two tents. I stayed hidden, thinking it was a ruse to catch me when I sprang from behind the cover of the tent, but the light never shone toward the tents. It didn’t come on again until it was near the excavation site, only to vanish down the staircase into the tomb.

I sat there for a long moment, unsure what to do. It seemed petty when James chewed me out for entering the tomb alone, but I had to question the motives of someone doing the same thing in the dead of night. Looting is a constant concern in archaeology, and I found myself suspecting the worst of whoever was venturing into the tomb under the cover of night. I pondered my options. I thought about telling James and letting him deal with it, but had no idea which tent was his. The last thing I wanted was to wake up half the camp looking for him, or worse, dredge up questions about why I was out past curfew. I could always lie about it, but I was wasting valuable time while this culprit did God knew what to the site and its artifacts. Even if I woke up Felix and asked for his help, the site could still be damaged, or artifacts might be stolen. I thought grimly how easy it would be for someone to squirrel away an artefact yet to be catalogued in the sand somewhere outside and smuggle it back to Cairo with their personal possessions.

If anyone was going to put a stop to this, it would have to be me. I steadied my resolve and returned the way I came, keeping a watchful eye on the electric light glowing from the tomb. I thought about asking Sam to join me as I passed her tent, but decided she needed rest more than I needed backup. Near the dining tent, I picked up my pace, feeling less concern about getting caught as I entered the shadows cast by the cliff overlooking the dig site. The tomb was only about a hundred yards from camp, but with the adrenaline coursing through my veins, it seemed to stretch on forever as loose sand swallowed my footsteps. A gentle breeze blew past me as I neared the top of the last sand dune. It carried the sound of someone inside the tomb speaking in hushed tones. For the first time, it occurred to me that whoever was in there might not be working alone. The limestone stairs leading to the dimly lit interior of the tomb came into view. I slowed my pace to a slow walk, trying to eavesdrop on whatever was being said in the tomb. Before I could discern whose voice it was or what they were saying, a new sound made me stop dead in my tracks. My eyes weren’t perfectly adjusted, but I caught the glimmer of eyes and heard the hiss of a snake as my foot nudged against something that felt like a rubber hose in the dark. I was terrified. Up to this point, I genuinely thought the closest thing to a snake encounter I would have was the time when Sam hissed and rubbed her foot up my calf under the dinner table in Cairo.

I reacted as you might expect: I screamed and ran. Not toward the steps leading to the tomb, but back toward camp. Whether it was a sidewinder or a cobra, I’ll never know, but its hiss intensified, and I swear I felt its body thud into the sand next to my foot as it missed. The chanting stopped. Footfalls echoed from within the tomb. Glancing over my shoulder, I caught a glimpse of shadows mingling with the light. I couldn’t tell if they belonged to one person or more. I raced back to camp, hoping I had only imagined the hiss of another snake as my footfalls landed in the dark sand beneath my feet. Rounding the corner of the dining tent, I saw the pale searching beam of the flashlight sweeping over camp from the dig site.

I tore off in the opposite side of the ring of tents, hiding behind them once more, but this time with the knowledge that someone was actively searching for me. I needed concealment, but as far away as my pursuer was, the noise I made was less of a concern. I panted and gasped for air, remembering the pains of growing up with asthma. I might have worried about a sudden resurgence, the first unexpected attack since my early high school years, if I wasn’t so scared of the unknown parties catching me. The gap between each tent provided me a short glimpse of the beam as it made its way from tent to tent. I was trying to gauge the best time to stop and wait for it to pass over me when, to my horror it the light went out. I had no idea why, but I was determined to make it to the safety of my own tent before it resumed its search. I sprinted, cutting a straight line through the open space in the middle of camp in a reckless attempt to save some distance.  

My whole tent shook as I tore open the zipper and jumped inside before closing it after me. I collapsed onto my cot and gasped for breath. I was terrified and had no idea what I witnessed in the tomb. I was more frightened when the searching spotlight resumed its search. Maybe it was  my nerves, but I swear it paused over the front of my tent, just for a moment, before it continued scanning the campsite. I laid there a long time, trying to relax. Whoever it was with the flashlight didn’t know it was me outside the tomb. Still, I feared the next encounter I’d have with the unknown person. It could have been almost anyone in our camp. I also worried it had all been a ruse. Maybe they knew it was me who caught them, and they wanted me to think I was safe. I suddenly wished I’d asked for Sam or Jorge to come with me earlier. I knew I could trust both of them. I could ask for their help in the morning, but that wouldn’t help me in the short term. Sleep didn’t come easy that night.
