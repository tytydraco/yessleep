GLITCH
Earth Designation 73475
Case File of Mark [REDACTED]

4/23/2021

Okay, think I’m doing this right. Sun is still teaching me the ropes of how to use the inter-dimensional viewers, so with luck, I won’t fuck this up and cause an Aberration to come through or something. Sun also tells me that’s not possible, but I mean… I don’t really know what’s possible anymore.

I caught Earth 73475 while doing mass surveillance the other day. Noticed that there were some odd issues cropping up here and there. stuff appearing where it shouldn’t or not being where it should. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that this world had been experiencing a series of disappearances that were increasingly going unexplained. People there one minute, gone the next, like they just slipped right out of existence. Honestly, people just popping out of being one by one would be one of the quieter apocalyptic events that they could be blessed with. Unfortunately it’s gotten worse.

I’m going to write the explanation here only because I’ve had to explain it a few times to the older Cognizants already and I’m tired of repeating myself. People in this reality are clipping out of existence. It’s a video game term usually, means that things are changing position in three dimensional space, often without moving of their own volition, and frequently passing through otherwise solid objects when doing it. In a videogame you just end up clipping through to a new empty space though, usually, and end up having to reset. Here though.. it’s having worse effects. Most of the missing people started getting discovered after a few days to weeks thanks to decomposition. Their bodies would usually get clipped a few feet away from wherever they were at the moment, but more often than not they would end up inside solid objects. Some people would get yanked from walking on the street to suddenly embedded under twelve tons of concrete below. A cafe in Manhattan ended up finding a guy partially fused to the back of their walk-in freezer one day, the half of him inside the freezer frozen solid after being stuck there overnight. Meanwhile the other half was stuck in the wall of stainless steel and insulation. Truth be told, things ended up being gruesome. 

It’s starting to make sense though, because there have also been unexplained suicide breakouts in the past few weeks all over this universe. People “jumping” to their deaths suddenly from windows or off the top of buildings. Except no windows would be open, they would have no hints of suicidal ideation, anything like that. Turns out, they were just getting suddenly popped through empty space a few feet in one direction, teleporting them straight through walls so they could plummet to their deaths. What a shitshow.

Those were the merciful deaths, of course. As time has gone on, the glitches have started occurring more and more, with people clipping in more strange ways, or only partially. I got into some of the street cameras in LA and saw one poor lady stuck from her shoulders down in the sidewalk on Hollywood Boulevard. She was one of those costume characters that try to scam tourists for expensive pictures, had on one of the worst Elsa wigs I’ve ever seen, but god… blood pouring from her mouth as she was crushed to death by displaced concrete wasn’t something anyone deserved.

The glitches are becoming more frequent. I’ve sent a contact to the Collective of this universe to hopefully find out what they know. 

4/29/2021

Clipping isn’t the only problem now. I swear this universe is running off what we would see as a bad videogame build. Some materials and areas have suddenly started de-rendering from their reality. It’s like they’ll be fine one minute, but then the next they either pop out of existence entirely, becoming simply a flat picture of what was once there, or they experience a massive downgrade where people begin popping out into pixels and polygons, distorting painfully in ways that no human body should bend. It’s not only people either, because entire buildings suddenly becoming flat, and when they do, everyone in them is mercilessly flattened inside. Collective agents have responded to sites of these render issues to find humans pancaked wherever they were standing or sitting at the time, totally flattened. Not sure if the render issue itself is the killer or if the sudden pressure change maybe kills them first.

The Collective of their reality is just as baffled as we are. Interestingly, they’ve had many less Aberrations on average than we or other universes have had. The only thing of note they’ve dealt with in recent years are humans exhibiting control over different types of glitches, but testing on these humans hasn’t led to any answers. They all mention a “Demo” but nothing of note on how to get there other than… near death experience. Sounds cliche, in my opinion, but that’s how it works.

5/3/2021

Glitched… humans? I think they’re humans. Or at least, they were humans at one point, maybe a precursor at that, have been steadily appearing. They’re like us from far away, but when you get a closer look you can see just how far off they are from us. They’re human in shape, two arms, two legs, between four feet and seven feet tall usually. Except when you see one up close, their faces and features, down to their clothes, are practically painted onto their bodies. I don’t know how else to describe it, but it was almost comical at first because they looked like really bad late-PS1 NPC models. 

Despite the uncanny look they’re wreaking havoc. They can appear seemingly anywhere at any time, hovering over the ground and sliding over it like they’re on some preset path. Anything they pass by ends up glitching, clipping around rapidly, stretching and elongating like a rubber band being pulled in too many directions. Human, animal, car, building, art installation… it doesn’t matter. Soon as these Glitches get close, they corrupt them. Dozens of people have been caught in their path, going through intense pain as their bodies are contorted far beyond human limits. Meantime these things only make a sound like a program crashing, the same sound clipping and restarting on itself until it’s one constant, deep roar of binary rage. Data is killing everyone, and they have no idea how to stop it. 

I have some of our software engineers doing examination of the universe now, but I fear it’s not going to be fast enough. Figure since it looks so much like a game, maybe they’ll be able to find something wrong. Maybe there’s a bad line of code in the fabric of this universe. If they can find it, maybe they can fix it.

5/6/2021

It’s gone. I swear it was… it was like across the globe multiple Glitch NPCs just appeared all at once. I don’t know if it was the force of them spread across that wide of an area or if it was just like some predetermined event, but the entire world contorted, stretching, pulling people from the surface and making gravity go crazy as the world bent and folded in on itself. Within moments, it was all over. There’s nothing there now. When I try to enter the surveillance for this Earth, there’s nothing to be found in the data. It’s like whoever was in charge of it came back to see just how many glitches there were and just pressed delete on it. Whatever it was, I hope we don’t have a delete button somewhere that we’re unaware of. I’ve instructed the engineers to do a thorough examination, make sure our world isn’t just some bad game of Civ that someone forgot about. I don’t think I’ll be able to blow off steam with videogames again for a while.

EARTH DEVOURS
Earth 13211
Case File of Mark [REDACTED]

11/4/2022

I’ve been keeping an eye on this Earth for a few months. Everything on it has checked out as normal for the most part, but something kept bringing me back. It started with reports of cities sinking into the ground. Just fractions of inches at first a couple months ago, but a lot of places like New York and Seattle were noticing that it was causing foundational issues with areas of the city. Even more, they noticed some of the underground disappearing, sinking even further into the Earth like it was being absorbed.

Turns out, it was. It didn’t just stop with the cities or buildings either. The news yesterday from this place had a video some guy took while he was out on a hike with his wife. They were in Appalachia, just walking along a trail. He was getting on his wife’s nerves, filming her from behind as they walked and making comments on the view, when suddenly she was just… gone. At first it’s like she just disappeared, and for a moment I had the fear that it was the glitch universe all over again, like corrupted file spreading across a computer drive and taking over other universes. When you slow the video down though, the Earth below her literally opens up to swallow her. It’s a small opening, just enough for her to fall through before she can even scream, but then she’s gone. 

Then similar stuff started popping up throughout in the last twenty four hours. People just being taken by the Earth, swallowed whole like a bite size snack for Mother Nature. Then the cities began to crumble in the past couple of hours and we realized that things have only gotten exponentially worse.

Entire cities are disappearing, swallowed completely by the ground beneath. In their place, new flora pops up. Beautiful flowers of every color imaginable, trees sprouting from the ground and shooting into the sky, hundreds of years of growth in mere minutes. 

I can only assume that Earth finally had enough of humanity destroying it, so it decided to eat the cancer taking over the surface. Nature is healing, but humanity is unlikely to survive.

11/6/2022

It only took a few days. I’m honestly… I’m amazed. The Earth has essentially retained all wild and plant life, but humans have become the number one enemy of creation. Any man made structures have been taken, reclaimed by the dirt below. Humans who dare to step out are almost immediately swallowed alive, with no idea where they go. We lost any contact with their Collective hours ago, their headquarters seemingly swallowed by something unknown. The Universal Surveillance Beacon can’t find any signs of human life where it is now, and that means we don’t have any direct view of the planet. I’m afraid it’s all gone, just like that.

THE DEEP SLEEPER
Earth Designation 38299
Case File of Jeremiah [REDACTED]

4/17/2003

I’ve already pissed off my share of the private enterprise sector working for this hell hole, but I think I may have made a lot of enemies today. Jesus, I’m probably going to have to get my family under security the way that oil CEO was looking at me during the emergency meeting. Oh well, I’ll take that up with Ronald and see if he can get me a meeting with the Director later this week. In the meantime, at least I know we aren’t going to make the same mistakes here that I saw happen on 38299.

Drilling operation happening at Point Nemo, deepest point in the ocean, managed to hit something. Intercepted their communications, and it escalated pretty quickly. First they thought it was just a layer of bedrock or something, maybe volcanic rock, I don’t know, they tossed around a lot of bullshit. Then the seismic activity started.  They pivoted over to thinking it was a piece of the tectonic plate and they just caused a shift.

Then the damn thing stood up. I can’t stress enough how deep Point Nemo is, but whatever they hit down there, they woke it up. It stood, rising from the ocean and knocking out the platform within seconds. It was… grotesque. Covered in rough scales the size of small islands, towering over the ocean and high into the clouds above, meanwhile the legs it was standing on were stil somehow able to keep it upright in the water. Damned thing had to be miles tall, four feet holding it up, and huge, serrated claws at the end of its four arms. I’m assuming the “bedrock” the drill hit was likely the surface of one of the scales, and that in turn woke it up.

If we’re being honest, I don’t believe it held any kind of malice toward humans. A majority of the first casualties were wimply due to the sheer size of the thing. It rose from the ocean, and in turn that displacement of water lead to tsunamis large enough to wipe out most coastal areas on Earth. Smaller countries were doomed from the start. In only minutes the rising water took out Japan, Greenland, most of Hawaii, the Korean Peninsula, half of India, and a vast majority of Central America. Those at higher elevations, while suffering less significant damage, weren’t immune either.

Most terrifying, and intriguing, in my opinion, is that the creature let out a massive roar after the first instance of waking up. This roar cleared the entire atmosphere around it, changing clouds, wind currents, and barometric pressure in most of the region. In turn, that caused massive storms to form all across the rest of the world, eventually spreading back to where the creature itself was.

It seems the storm was for the purpose of calming it though. As the rain came, it began to grow less agitated. The creature eventually, after moving around and causing more, smaller, tsunamis that did further damage to inland areas combined with the newly risen sea levels, settled back down. Damage was unfortunately already done though, and this thing had stirred up enough ancient ocean life on the bottom of the sea that there was no turning back. It woke other things up during its brief awakening, and those ended up going after humanity with a vengeance.

These… well, mermaids would be too lovely of a word to put on it. These things were like the Sirens of old myth, taking advantage of anyone trying to rescue or work relief for the already devastated world. They would hide in the water, calling out for health in human voices, begging for someone to come rescue them. When anyone did… they were devoured. The Sirens tore them to pieces, taking pleasure in the spray of warm blood as it washed over them. They were pale things, skin nearly translucent in the dark light of the storms. The last thing many saw was their sharp fangs into their flesh. 

Rescue efforts, scattered and mostly useless as they were, fell prey to other distorted sea life throughout the next few days. Massive fish would lure survivors in boats or floating on debris with bright lights, almost appearing like the lights of a search crew looking for survivors, only to emerge from the depths and swallow them. The rain just kept going, and after a few days, there was hardly any land left to call home. The scattered remnants of humanity continued on in boats and barges, but the hunting sea life ensured nowhere was safe.

I wrote this one off as a loss pretty early and put out a stop to any drilling around Point Nemo within a one thousand kilometer radius. Not sure if that giant thing is down there, but it’s better not to take the risk.

As with all moratorium notices, I had to give my case to the Director and private sector leadership so as to “consult” on what they could do as an alternative. These jackasses from the oil companies didn’t want any kind of alternative, just kept saying that they had taken the proper measures for drilling there and that my decision would lead to a potential crash of the industry. Told them I was fine with that. No doubt the bastards are going to try some intimidation tactics to get us to lift the measures. I’ll have Ronald set something up with the Director to get security for Penelope and Mark. Maybe it’s just me being paranoid from seeing the worst in humanity during observation but… I don’t know.

IMMERSION
Earth 38848
Case File of Mark [REDACTED]

2/14/2023

Talk about depressing. The folks in research and development have been trying to come up with a new way to look in on other universes the past few years, mostly because even the most outdated universes are starting to phase out analog technology. They’ve found ways of hacking into some digital feeds, but it’s a total crapshoot thanks to different universes variance in binary code or some shit. I don’t know, not my department. Well, now they’ve found a new way that will let us Cognizants take a peek into our own minds, so to speak.

They brought us a VR system that allows us to basically take a backseat to ourselves in other universes. Honestly, it works out pretty well. I’ve been doing some research, and we usually keep up with alternate versions of important persons throughout these other worlds. One thing that I noticed- Cognizants aren’t consistent across universes. By that I mean each universe has its own unique Cognizants, if they have them at all. We’ve found quite a few places that don’t even have their own version of the Collective, so things obviously aren’t uniform, but in all of the multiverse, I’m the only version of Mark [REDACTED] that has Cognizant ability.

So, they gave us the VR headset and we strap it on, find alternate versions of ourselves, and basically get to back seat drive with them. They have no idea we’re there, of course, and we have no control over their actions, but it gives us a direct view of what’s going on on the ground. 

Which made this Earth all the more depressing to see. It was… well, it was an odd one.

I tuned in yesterday, taking up my spot with the headset and picking this Earth out of all the possible other versions of me. To be honest, I had some ulterior motives. This version of Earth was one where, with no Collective, dad was present for most of my life. Mom was alive. Things seemed… nice. I had finished up my doctorates, had a pretty successful business, and things were good. Went to have Sunday dinner at my parents house every weekend, got to see all of us be happy, live like a normal family…

Then the Happy came. It was… an insidious disease. Nobody was able to figure out the cause for it because every attempt at it just lead to the same dead end. Nobody could stay focused to research it long enough to find a cure because they were too busy filling their heads with dopamine and endorphins while barely batting an eye. It was bliss, and it damned us all.

Shit. I shouldn’t say us. They warned me about… well, about confusing the me here with the me there. Keep your life separate, because you have a job to do here. People depend on you, Mark. 

It started in December of 2022. A company called Avarice, I’ve seen them a few times in Dad’s old case files, they were found to be pulling some seriously unethical experiments on their employees across multiple lines of business. This place was like a mega corporation, fingers all over manufacturing, shipping, the medical field, food, you name it. Anyway, first cases came to light in December and everything has gone so downhill in the last few weeks it’s hard to believe it’ll last much longer.

The first news reports were about the “happiest workplace in America”. An Avarice packaging facility that had the highest rate of worker satisfaction recorded, with everyone giving glowing reviews and talking about their excitement to come into work every day. Their production had more than tripled in the past month along with the change in attitude. A few days later, some whistleblower came forward to say exactly why that was- Avarice was leaking chemicals into the facility that were causing a constant, massive release of dopamine into worker’s brains. 

In any normal world this would have led to a lawsuit and the company getting shut down. Instead, it became one of the most highly demanded secrets in the business sector. Companies were clambering to try and steal the chemical formula from Avarice and put it to use in their own workplaces, believing this could be the answer to the economic unrest that was starting to show through the cracks of the worldwide system.

Of course, Avarice in their infinite wisdom, stupidity, greed, whatever you want to pin it on, never did any long term testing of their chemical concoction. So, the mass, nonstop dopamine releases that were happening didn’t stop once the employee clocked out for the day. It kept on going, even after they got home.

Whether the chemical leaked out into the world and started causing genetic changes or what, nobody knows, but it started to spread beyond the workers. Maybe something in the chemical stayed in their system,  then passed like a contagion. Maybe they were lying about it being chemical and using some form of technology that got into the wrong hands, maybe they created a bio-weapon instead. Who the hell knows? By mid-January, there was an epidemic of happiness sweeping the globe. 

Bad thing about being constantly happy is that your own joy and contentment overrides any sense of self-preservation. Why do anything to trigger the dopamine rush to the brain if it’s just going to keep on going no matter what, after all? 

God, it was like losing them all over again. I was plugged in, doing my due diligence to see if this was a potential apocalypse or something humanity might miraculously recover from, but in turn I had to lose my parents all over again. I went over there for Sunday dinner this past weekend, or… the other me went. I think it’s the last time we’ll see our parents.

Dinner was usually bubbling away on the stove when I walked in their house. Today there was nothing. Even the usual reruns of old movies that dad would sit and watch on weekends weren’t playing on the television in the living room. Something was off from the moment we stepped foot inside.

We found them laying in bed, eyes nearly glazed over from bliss, smiles on their faces. They would hardly react to anything that we did or said. Eyes didn’t respond to external stimulus. Judging by how they looked… they had been lying there for a few days. There were noticeable stains on the sheets to show they had soiled themselves there, but it was like they didn’t care at all.

The other me…. I think he’s starting to feel the affects too. I took off as soon as I saw Mom and Dad smiling like that, figured I would check back in later to see what’s going on. Came back earlier today and the other me is just… sitting on their couch. I honestly don’t think he ever left their house after finding them. He’s just sitting there, I can see his smile in the reflection off the television. No matter how much I hope that he’s going to make some move, get up and leave, or even just look at his phone, nothing happens.

I’ll check back in a couple of days but… I fear this one is lost.

2/17/2023

I can’t find a living version of me on that Earth. I believe he may have starved to death, sitting there on that old couch, smiling like an idiot. God… what a way to go.

KNOCKING ON HEAVEN’S DOOR
Earth 84778
Case File of Jeremiah [REDACTED]

7/12/1979

I was raised religious. Mom would always tell me when we were going through tough times that “angels were watching over us”. I know it gave her comfort, but I was honestly indifferent to the thought. Figured if angels were watching over us they were doing the bare minimum job of keeping things together. After today… I hope those bastards are staying far, far away from me.

Earth 84778 has been going through what I would call a Second Enlightenment, at least in the United States there. Lots of people getting taken in by religious fervor, notably that of the Christian bible. Being an evangelist is one hell of a profitable career around these parts if you do it right, but over on this Earth it can be a downright kingmaker for some. They don’t quite have their own Billy Graham, but some of the folks over there are on the verge of launching very literal crusades that would make their ancestors tell them to pump the brakes.

One of the most famous evangelists in this universe, N. Hauser, makes it a habit to lead a worship service every Sunday morning, live broadcasting it across the nation. Does it out of huge football stadiums, rents ‘em out before games on Sunday afternoons, even made some deals with the Universe’s version of the NFL to do discount tickets for his congregation. He’s got a hell of a lot of sway too, considering he sits on the board of Avarice Corporation in his universe. 

Okay, a little background though, in the past few months, attendance has been falling off, with a more modern spiritualist movement starting to take up from grassroots organizations around the country. This new pop up emphasizes a more non-corporate form of congregation, urging that the message has gotten too clouded and convoluted by modern capitalism. Considering the amount of advertisements behind Hauser when he’s at the pulpit, I’m inclined to agree with them. 

Well, it looks like Hauser and his people had a little idea to try and kneecap these new movements while reinforcing their own base at the same time- stage an attack on their congregation. Sunday morning service was going strong last weekend. Over seventy thousand people in attendance singing along to old hymns when suddenly an explosion rocks the stadium. One of Hauser’s men had planted a bombs in the choir gallery, killing nearly six thousand people.

You would think to make it look natural Hauser would have… I don’t know, encouraged everyone to evacuate, said some words of memorial maybe? Instead he runs up to the pulpit frothing like a mad man. Tells people that the Church is under attack, that they needed to stand strong and plant their feet in the foundation of the lord, and starts preaching. I’ve gotta tell you, I’ve seen a lot of weird stuff during my time here, but this one was egregious in some of the worst ways. Live on television, broadcast across the United States and in some European countries, Hauser went on a three hour spiel about how no enemies will be able to hide from the light of god. Dead bodies on the ground behind him, giant cross that was behind the pulpit up in flames, blood and dismembered limbs all over the place… Billy Graham, eat your fuckin’ heart out. 

Well, apparently God or whatever was up there wasn’t very happy with having their followers slaughtered in a false flag. When Hauser started demanding everyone bow their heads in prayer, up on stage with arms spread wide like he was going to be crucified for their sins next, they started to appear. The angels. There was a loud blast like an entire brass band blowing on their instruments at once, all in discordant notes, and suddenly they were everywhere.

Sunday school always gave me this image of angels that definitely didn’t prepare me for the real thing. Usually they showed us these tall people with halos and robes, playing harps or carrying trumpets. No, these were just… eyes. Hundreds of eyes floating freely in clusters, freely moving around each other as light emanated from an unseen core. Most everyone left in the stands was incinerated on contact upon making eye contact with the angels.

Though it sounded garbled, I swear I heard one say the old cliche “Be not afraid” line. Hard to not be afraid when you’re staring down a cluster of eyes surrounded by pillars of flesh though, especially when they’re giving off enough light to make Oppenheimer wince.

Hauser…that son of a bitch stood his ground. I don’t know if it was because he actually wasn’t afraid or just because he was that far gone in his zealotry, but he stood his ground on live television with an angel, staring them down. Until the angel zapped him with a ray of light, leaving behind a towering, shining pillar of salt where he stood. 

Maybe God was watching from heaven the whole time, waiting to see what direction humanity was going to go. I like to think he saw one man kill off thousands of his devoted followers and decided that there was no redeeming any of them. Whatever He decided, that was the end of 84778. The angels descended on the entire world, floating their way through cities and the countryside. 

Those that bowed in reverence were given merciful deaths. If they even were deaths. I saw some in the football stadium bow before the angel and suddenly their clothes fell to the ground, no longer hanging on bodies. It would be a mercy if they werw sent straight to heaven for their compliance.

Some governments attempted to fight the newfound enemy. It went about as well as you would think. I saw news footage we intercepted of a nuclear warhead being launched straight at one of them. It hit the cluster of eyes head on, but instead of exploding it was just… absorbed into the light that was already emanating from it. In return this angel shot back the thinnest beam of light, like a piece of thread screaming through the air, and the plane that launched the missle was gone, blown into thousands of pieces.

I thought they were going to be the worst of it, but then the trumpets began. These massive beings appeared in the sky two days ago, each holding a long, golden trumpet. Some were holding bowls, others giant scrolls. Look, I may have been bored as all get out in Sunday School as a kid, but the book of Revelations had always kept my interest in a morbid way. I knew what these things were. The Hosts of Heaven.

I don’t need to see any further, this world is lost. Agatha has said she’ll be keeping watch just to make sure all the data is recorded, but I think she’s just too morbidly curious for her own good. Until it’s over, I told her she could keep an eye on it. I’m only to be alerted if the big man himself [shows up](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/UeiOLNmWWB).
