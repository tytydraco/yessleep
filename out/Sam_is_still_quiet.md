He's staring at me. He’s always so quiet these days. Dinner is done. I don’t feel like washing the dishes tonight and I promise myself I’ll do them tomorrow. I put them on top of a stack of other dishes where I promised myself the same thing. Sam doesn’t seem to mind. He just sits quietly, staring. It’s not an accusatory scare. It’s a questioning stare. A question that has been growing the past few weeks.

It’s quiet in the hallway outside our small apartment also. I like to come out here and look out the window at the stars, endless and all consuming. Maybe we’ll crash into one someday and all of this will be just a blip. If no one remembers, did it actually happen?

As I walk down the hallway I listen to the echo of my footsteps and try to sing a song to the beat. A quick shuffle and a stomp to really drive it home, and then I’m dancing down the empty, echoing hallway, singing at the top of my lungs. No one pops their head out to see what’s going on or to tell me to be quiet, but I stop singing and stand silently anyway, listening. I hear a computer whining and the thump of my own heartbeat, but nothing else.

At the end of this hallway is a door I haven’t tried yet. I open the panel and pull out the wires.

Finding a player inside would be nice. Listening to music outside my own head would be a rare gift. Food would be ideal; we only have a few cans left inside the apartment. A weapon really would be best. I haven’t decided yet on who I would use it on first.

I touch the wires together and the door shushes open. Another apartment, bigger than mine. Maybe middle management sized. The living room is neat and beige. I move a throw pillow and sink into the couch. Maybe Sam and I should move in here. I’m assuming the occupants won’t mind.

I realize that is a big assumption as I stand and begin to walk through the apartment looking for them. I find them in bed, tucked under the covers. The husband has his arm over his wife, holding her close, his blue lips almost brushing her neck. I know I can’t disturb them, but I still back carefully out of the room and close the door.

In the kitchen I find cans of food and load them into my bag, filling it as much as I can. I can come back for more later. The rest of the apartment turns up only the remnants of a happily married life. Pictures of the couple with who I am assuming is their children. Keep-sakes, knick-knacks, trinkets are scattered on shelves from travels. Nothing useful. They have books, though. I peruse through them and choose a crime thriller, shoving it into my bag on top of the cans.

I’ve exhausted the useful contents of the apartment and it’s time to leave. I stand at the door, listening, ready to emerge back into the hallway. I’m satisfied that it’s empty and head out, wishing the couple a small goodbye and thank you as I do.

Halfway down the hallway I hear nails scrabbling on metal and I begin to run, my feet pounding in time with my heart. Looking back will waste time and I plow forward, though my instincts are screaming to see what is coming for me. I’ve heard what happens to those who see and know better.

At my apartment door I grab the wires. I’m old hat at this now, and the door quickly slides open. I smash the shut button and slide against the wall as a crash shakes the door next to me, followed by more nails scrabbling on metal. It hasn’t figured out the wiring yet.

Sam is still quiet as I stack the cans with the rest. The book fell out as I was running. I’ll go back for it later. My hands have stopped shaking and my heart is starting to slow. I’m tired. I'll write more later, but now I'll crawl onto the bed and sleep.
