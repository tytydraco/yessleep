he year was 2025. I was still a single mom residing in Florida with my daughter, Alice. I had been raising her since my husband and I divorced due to his infidelity. Alice was just four at the time, but fortunately, I won the court case, receiving a significant settlement. We moved to Florida on June 11, 2025, just two days after Alice's fifth birthday.

Life was peaceful after our move. I had secured a new job as a teacher, which I found fulfilling and enjoyed immensely. Everything seemed calm until one evening, while I was relaxing on the couch watching TV, Alice approached me, crying and frightened.

“Sweetheart, what happened?” I asked, my heart racing with concern. “It’s okay; you can tell me anything. Mommy needs to know.”

“I…,” she hesitated for a moment, “I saw someone, Mama. It was a tall man, and he looked creepy. I thought he was nice, but he scared me.”

I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me as I processed her words. Part of me wondered if she was just imagining things, as children often do. However, I also trusted my daughter. I replied, “Honey, maybe you were just imagining it. I promise there’s no scary man in the house. Even if it were true, remember that your mama is a superhero, right?” She nodded, her eyes glistening with tears.

It was past her bedtime, so I tucked her in, read her a story, and kissed her forehead, wishing her goodnight. Later that night, I went to bed, but the next morning, I woke up, went through my routine, and headed to school to teach. About four to five hours later, I returned home to grade my students’ tests.

Suddenly, I heard Alice scream, “Ahhhhhhh!” I rushed to her room, where she was crying and visibly shaken, pointing at the playhouse. My concern deepened, and I reassured her that everything would be alright. As midnight approached, I put her to bed. While she slept, I decided to install a camera in her room for safety.

As I sat in my room, monitoring the camera and trying not to doze off, I eventually succumbed to sleep. About thirty minutes later, a noise jolted me awake. I heard sounds from the playroom, and to my disbelief, objects were moving on their own. Then, I saw a tall, shadowy figure. Fear gripped me as I noticed its glowing red eyes and unsettling smile.

Adrenaline surged through me, and I sprinted towards the figure, flinging the door open. “Who are you?” I shouted. It turned to face me, its eyes piercing through the darkness. In a moment of instinct, I punched it and rushed to grab Alice, who was confused but terrified when she saw the figure.

The doors locked, and panic set in. I grabbed a bat to hit the figure, but it passed right through it. “Alice, run!” I urged, as the figure pursued us. The TV began to flicker and static filled the air, indicating its strange powers. My sole focus was protecting my daughter from this menace.

The figure seized me by the throat, choking me, and everything began to fade. Just then, Alice returned with a spray, and we dashed upstairs. I used the spray, but it quickly ran out. I realized the figure was weakened, and I opened a window, preparing to escape. However, just as we were about to flee, it grabbed me again.

“Run, Alice!” I shouted through tears. I assured her that everything would be okay and expressed my love for her. The figure smiled menacingly as it dragged me away. Alice managed to escape and ran into the street, searching for help. I held onto the hope that she was safe, even as everything went dark around me. The last thing I saw was the figure’s mouth opening wide before everything turned blank but all the sudden i didn't want to give up so i grab his hand and bite it and i ran straight to the door, and soon i saw my daughter in the police station and i told them everything about a guy in my house and the police went there but according to report nobody was there.......
