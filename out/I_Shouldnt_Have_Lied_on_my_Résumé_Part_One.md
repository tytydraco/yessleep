I live in Vermont with my wife Kat and our newborn son. We moved out here a year ago due to me accepting a position as VP of Operations at a grocery store chain. We love the area out here, and were lucky enough to purchase our dream home. Everything was great until a few months back my company went bankrupt leaving us without any income. Kat has always been great with finance, so we had a nest egg saved, but I needed a well paying job fast. Homes in a nice neighborhood, and kids aren't cheap. I had been searching online for jobs with no luck until a strange posting caught my eye.

It was for a deckhand position on a ship named the *Overlook*. The ship was to set sail for a three week expedition from Panama City to various points in the Atlantic Ocean, observing wildlife behavior in the area. What really stood out was the pay $60K.

"Hey Kat come here you have to see this"

My wife came into the room half awake from a nap. "What is it honey?"

I pointed at the posting. "This job is paying $60k for three weeks work. That kind of money would easily get us back on track until I find something more permanent."

She laughed. "Babe you've never even been on a boat. You can't even swim, besides it says experience needed."

"I'll just make it up, how hard could it be? We have to do something."

That's exactly what I did. I lied. I wish now I hadn't.

Later that evening during dinner with Kat I received an email alert on my phone. It read: *You have been selected for the deckhand position on the overlook. Report to the port at 0730hrs this Saturday.* Below the message was a round trip plane ticket. I was shocked.

"Kat you won't believe this, but they already offered me the job"

As surprised as I was she took my phone and read the email. "This doesn't seem right. I have a bad feeling about this." 

We spent the evening discussing it, and decided if there were even a chance it was real the money was to good to pass on. I spent the next few days studying/watching anything about sailing I could find, and sharing quality time with my family. Friday evening I kissed Kat and our son goodbye, and headed to the airport. Despite me learning a little about sailing I wasn't prepared for what would come next. The following journals are daily logs of my time at sea. Logs of how my life changed forever.

DAY 1

I arrived at the port around 7AM. Upon landing I was send an email on how to find the ship, and soon I was standing In front of the *Overlook*. It appeared a mid-sized ship painted a Matte Sky Blue. I barely had time to take in the ships beauty when a man maybe in his forties stepped onto the dock extending a hand.

"You must be my new deckhand, names Captain Reese."

He had a no nonsense demeanor about him, and I found myself doubting if he had ever laughed in his life.

Grasping his hand I replied. " Yes Sir"

Reese looked towards the ship. " Go ahead and board, the rest of the crew is waiting. I'll begin my briefing shortly."

I made my way up the boarding ramp, and stepped onto the ship. My legs swayed a little after my first steps, and when I looked up I saw who I now know as our mechanic Gibbs staring at me, noticing my uneasy legs. Captain Reese gathered us together, and began his briefing.

"Alright men, and lady," he said looking at our Marine Biologist Sarah. She appeared to be in her late twenties with long blonde hair. "I wanna be clear before we head out. I'm in charge here, and I expect an efficient and competent crew. We are on a deadline, and I don't miss deadlines. Seven days to get to the coordinates, Seven to study the wildlife, and seven to get back. Let's take a moment to introduce ourselves, unpack our bags, and be ready to sail at 0830hrs sharp."

Sarah introduced herself, then Gibbs, Austin our cook, Danny another deckhand (who creepily stared at Sarah the entire time), then myself. At 8:30am we were off. My first job was to mop/buff the deck, then about mid-day Gibbs approached me to help him with his engine room checks. 

He showed me around a bit then asked. "How long you been sailing kid?" 

I swallowed the lump in my throat. " About three years"

He cackled. "Ha kid I could tell by your first steps onboard you haven't sailed a day in your life."

My secret quickly exposed I explained the events that had led me there.

He put a hand on my shoulder. "Don't worry kid i won't say anything to the rest of the crew. Stick with me, and you'll be just fine. You remind me a bit of my boy, and I respect any man that is trying to earn a living for his family."

At that moment the ship began to shake and rock violently.

Gibbs looked at me concerned. "Let's get back to the deck to see what's going on."

Upon getting topside a beautiful day had turned to anything but. The sky was dark grey, thunder crashed in deafening bursts, and lightning flashed in jagged Crimson Red streaks. Huge waves hit the starboard side that were Jet Black, hardly resembling water at all. 

I turned to Gibbs. " Have you ever seen red lightning before?"

The look on his face answered before he spoke." No kid, I've never seen anything like that."

I looked over and noticed Sarah collecting a sample of the Jet Black substance. Reese's voice came across the ships PA system. "Nobody panic I have it under control."

The violent storm went on for about fifteen minutes, then in mere seconds all was calm again. The sky blue, water clear, and calm. Reese's voice came over the PA once more. "Looks like we are in the clear. Dinner should be ready in the Galley if anyone is hungry." His calm demeanor made me uneasy.

The Galley was a large open area with multiple tables each seating four people.  Austin stood towering over a food station similar to that of a high school lunch line. (he was a very large man) I grabbed a tray, and approached him. "What's on the menu tonight? have any burger's or steak?"

He looked at me with kind naive eyes. He appeared to be maybe twenty. " Um no burgers or steak. Captain doesn't like red meat, or um allow it on the ship. Tonight we have ham, beans, and um salad."

I nodded. He put some of each on my tray, I thanked him and seated myself next to Gibbs who was already devouring his food. "Gibbs what's your take on what happened tonight?"

He looked up from his tray." Weird things happen at sea kid. Some that can't be explained." he continued tearing into his piece of ham.

"The Captain didn't seem surprised at all. Do you know any back story on him?"

"He has a lot of experience I know that much, and has been through a lot. It's my first time sailing with him, but I've heard somethings. Rumor is on his last expedition he lost his entire crew. They went mad."

"Went mad?! What would cause an entire crew to go mad?"

"Probably rookie sailors that drank salt water or something. I told you strange things happen at sea kid. Best to put it out of your mind." 

I could not. Something was obviously off about the Captain. As I sit lost in thought staring at my food, Sarah walked into the Galley followed by Danny, who was staring at her ass displaying a big green gap toothed smile. 

Sarah waved at Austin. "Great to see you again, I've been craving your famous ham since our last expedition together. "

Austin gleamed with happiness. It was obvious he had a thing for her. "Great to um see you too. You look lovely tonight as um always Miss Sarah." 

Danny jumped into the conversation. "Tell you what blondie, If you come back to my room tonight I'll feed you the best meat you've ever had." He grabbed at her ass.

Sarah knocked his hand away, "Fuck you creep." she then spit right in his face, and stormed over to our table. Danny wiped the Lugi into his mouth, and sit at a table aligned to continue to stare at her. Smiling still. Austin behind the counter stared holes through him like daggers.

What appetite I had was gone after the Lugi ordeal, so I offered my food to Sarah. "Want some more famous ham? I'm not hungry." 

"No thanks.  I'm just gonna have a quick bite, I have to get this water sample under a microscope asap." She held up a small tube containing the black substance. "It's truly remarkable. watch." The substance inside seemed to pulse, and at random intervals would disappear, then reappear almost like it was phasing in and out of existence.  

All of this was to much to take in. I was exhausted by the long day, and decided I would get some sleep so I could rationalize things logically in the morning. Back in my quarters sleep came quickly, followed by the realest feeling nightmare of my life. 

I was in the middle of the sea surrounded by black water, desperately trying to swim. I flailed my arms violently against the waves trying to tread water, gasping for air. Water entered my lungs. I was sinking. I attempted to scream, but was silenced by the oceans icy depths. Something had a hold of my leg. I began to plummet to the sea floor rapidly, and soon I was at the bottom. I couldn't move, I was paralyzed. I could feel the presence of something watching me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I was sure it would explode.

In the darkness of the void two red eyes (each appearing the size of a whale) revealed themselves, partially illuminating it's face.  It had two long horns similar to that of a demon.  It was smiling, displaying hundreds of jagged long thin teeth. The areas of it's face that had flesh, didn't appear to be it's own. Like it was compiled of multiple people melded together.  The unfleshed areas consisted of tissue, and nerves.

I knew it was the end for me, when suddenly I began rapidly ascending back towards the surface. I was speeding past half Rotten/Skinned corpses on both sides, all reaching for me trying to stop my escape.  As I hit the surface I was jolted back to reality. Sitting upright in my bed sweating, heaving trying to catch my breath I coughed up black water. Now fully awake I felt something probing, crawling it's way into my mind. A thought, no more like a voice, an unhuman voice attempting to sound human. 

It said one word. "DEVOUR" 

 Sleep didn't return that night.
