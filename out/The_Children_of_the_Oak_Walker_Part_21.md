“Feel free to borrow anything that strikes your fancy.”

I jumped despite myself, so absorbed in my book that I hadn’t heard Professor Carheim approach through the maze of bookshelves in the tiny library. “Oh, thanks, but we’ll be leaving on the patrol soon. I just wanted to get a few more pages in.”

In truth, I’d already devoured three books in the course of the morning. Andrea had set up a sleeping nook for me in the corner of their miniature university, snuggled amongst novels twice as old as I was. Professor Carheim sat up late into the night to talk with me, and after a while, I’d confided everything to him. It felt good to get all my secrets off my chest, and he proved to be a fantastic listener, which made the conversation about Chris and Jamie easier to have. After sleeping through the night for the first time in so long, I woke up to a silent library, and let my curiosity get the better of me. I had barely touched the pre-selected books issued by the Organs, but here, surrounded by all manner of subjects, genres, and time periods, I dove into the forest of words with a voraciousness I didn’t know I had.

Professor Carheim set a tray down on a small table beside my cot, laden with the typical ration that all tunnel dwellers received; a slice of spam fried on both sides, two pieces of stale white bread, and mixed vegetables from a can that had been warmed in a saucepan over the communal burners. Any other time I might have been disappointed, but my appetite had returned with my new-found freedom, and I scarfed it all down without complaint.

*Never knew crunchy green beans could taste this good.*

“You read fast.” He gestured to my finished pile, a delighted twinkle to his sharp eyes. “I see you found *A Canticle for Leibowitz*. Most students in my experience never showed much interest in that one.”

I nudged the aged paperback with my elbow as I gobbled down my bread slices. “It’s not bad, actually. Kind of sad though, in a weird, old-timey way. It’s really . . . oh, how do I put it?”

“Mystical.” Professor Carheim sank down on a stool in the corner opposite me and ran his eyes over the books with a melancholy smile. “A word we’ve banished in our modern era, I’m afraid. So many people want to divorce science and theology, as if the two must exist in separate realms. They build all their principles on one side, and when impossible things happen that their worldview cannot explain, they commit moral suicide out of despair. Thus, the students I taught about the Nazis and Soviets are now wearing jackboots, the scientific libraries have been purged of facts to be restocked with lies, and the churches were all shut down or converted into propaganda shrines for the state. Such is the inevitable end of our current age; we didn’t want to be accountable to either God or a textbook, so in our arrogance we destroyed both.”

Finishing my humble breakfast, I downed the glass of water provided for me, and eyed him from across the oblong reading table. “So, what about you? You were a professor, before all this. Which side are you on?”

Professor Carheim chuckled and shook his gray head. “Neither, Miss Brun. I used to be firmly within the secular camp, but ever since our little county descended into the abyss, I’ve been rudely awakened to my own academic blinders. You cannot divorce the sacred from the scientific; they are interchangeable. Our world is shaped by the forces of good and evil, light and darkness, order and chaos. Just look at the various cultures, religions, and spiritual movements across the world for thousands of years. Billions of people indirectly agreed that we are adrift in a war between two great forces, and how we choose to act determines whether such forces find victory within our own lives, or defeat. It is only within the recent decades that mankind decided we were above all that, stuck our noses in the air, and claimed everyone who came before us was an idiot. We will be forever remembered as the generation who believed in nothing, and yet thought we knew everything.”

“But how does that explain the Breach?” I propped my chin in one hand, too enthralled at this man’s impressive words to stop asking questions, but still hesitant to debate him as I doubted I had the intellect to match his. “I mean, it’s got to be something we can understand, right? It’s made of electromagnetic radiation, so it must be scientific.”

“And where do you come from?” He cocked his head to one side and pointed a spidery finger to my own skull. “Not your body but *you*, the thoughts, the emotions, the decisions inside your head? Religion calls it a soul, science a life-force, but all the same, there is something about us as humans that is transient, eternal, spiritual. How can we measure that? We have no idea where our soul originates, but it is certainly real, as you can watch it leave the body on cerebral scans of dying patients, each synapse flickering out until the last of their firing patterns fall silent. Does that mean you do not exist because the real you cannot fit into the boundaries of a textbook?”

Pulling my legs up to my chest, I wrapped both arms around my knees and chewed my lower lip in contemplation. “I guess not.”

“And what about the way you are now?” Professor Carheim gestured to my body in general and laced his fingers together on the table between us. “Where does it say in the holy texts that a human can mix with a creature born from charcoal and sunlight? How can a new species of intelligent beings come from seemingly nowhere, and live among us as a human? Do Puppets have souls? Do they get them before or after they are converted? Will the unconverted dead ones be damned by God, or pardoned due to their animalistic nature? Nowhere in any religious print does it speak of these things. Does that mean you do not exist because the answers to your condition aren’t explicitly written in any spiritual book, or does it mean that we in our current era are too proud, stupid, and blind to admit that we’ve been reading it wrong for decades?”

*I never thought of it that way.*

“So,” I sat up a little straighter, heart aflutter as if I were poised on the edge of some forbidden temple like a great explorer. “You’re saying the Breach doesn’t have to be explained in order to be real; therefore, any belief that prohibits its existence is wrong?”

At this, however, Carheim shrugged. “Not wrong per se, so much as off-target. Science can explain electromagnetic radiation, but it cannot explain your apparent interactions with the supernatural, whether it be memories not your own, or the stranger you mentioned in the yellow suit. Religion can easily account for such things as gifts from a higher power, but often it paints all of creation with a broad brush, such as labeling the mutants from the void as ‘demons’ from hell itself. They are both right and wrong, you see. God isn’t punishing Barron County, and evolution didn’t create the Breach or its creatures.”

“So, what is it then?” I folded my arms atop my kneecaps, yearning to have some tangible information at my grasp to make sense of this bizarre world I’d been bound to. “How can an entire county just vanish from the maps? How come no one else has heard of this place?”

He went silent for a moment, and Professor Carheim met my eye, his own expression grave. “Chaos. Sentient, intelligent chaos. Somehow the veil has been torn that usually separates it from us, and now the malevolent powers of the universe are attacking our world.”

It sounded absurd, like something from a comic book poster, but then again, who was I to laugh? I had been infected by mutagenic roots, I could read through complex chapter books like they were postcards, and the entire county had been overrun by eldritch horrors unlike anything I’d ever seen before. How could I argue that such a concept as intelligent chaos wasn’t feasible, when my very existence, the genetics meshed within my body, were no longer part of what modern science or contemporary religion considered possible?

*I miss when the world was simpler, and I didn’t believe in things that could make Lovecraft wet himself.*

Sensing my hesitant acceptance, Professor Carheim reclined against the far brick wall, and went on. “The truth is that what science sees as evolution, and what all manner of religions viewed as the might of their gods, is simply the forces of the universe at work. Both are sentient, in my observation, and both directly oppose each other. Our kind was made from light and order, while the mutants were shaped by the dark and chaos.”

I raised an eyebrow, determined to root out some kind of hole in his theory, as my stubborn brain still refused to absorb it. “How do you know it isn’t the other way around? What if we’re made by chaos, and they are made by order? I mean, they probably think we’re the monsters.”

“An excellent question.” He granted me a slight bow of his head in acknowledgment of my point. “I believe Tolkien said it best when he inferred that evil cannot create, only warp what good has made, for its own twisted devices. Look at the anomalies that roam our county, Hannah. True, they are horrific, but all of them are based on subject matter from our world; plants, machines, or living beings. Nothing is unique or alien in terms of structure, just modified, incomplete, malformed. You need seek no further for examples than your golden-haired allies in the Ark River congregation, and their opponents in the army of this Vecitorak fellow. Two groups, from the same source, but with very different outcomes. One is beautiful, creative, gentle, much like the angels of old sent to guard men against evil. The other is ugly, destructive, and violent, a perfect depiction of the demonic forces our ancestors only spoke of in fearful whispers. As for why Barron County has been forgotten, well, that is an interesting problem. You see, it’s not as if the names, road numbers, and locations aren’t familiar to the outer world. There are other Black Oaks, other Route 142’s and other Barron Counties, and other wildlife reserves, but they are all in different places far from here. So, what is the answer? Chaos has already wiped us from the collective memory of the majority of mankind, save for a few scraps that lead people like yourself here by happenstance. It spreads false information to sow confusion, puts roads in places they weren’t meant to be, all so that no one will question our absence as the whirlpool drags us down. Order, however, has preserved us from being swallowed entirely, hence the map your friends discovered to lead you here, the old records in our courthouse that date back to 1901, and the ability for ELSAR to come and go as they please. The battle lines are being drawn, and it will be on our soil that the gods of old test their strength.”

Unsettled by the mental image of shadowy giants crouched over our world like players at a game board, I rubbed at the scars on my arm, the tattooed vines gleaming in the candlelight. “So . . . what does that make me then? Am I from order, or chaos? Why would God, or any sentient force, want me like *this?*”

“Not every question is meant to be answered, Hannah.” His voice took on a sympathetic tone, and Professor Carheim held my gaze with laser-intensity. “But as someone who has become much more religious in this past year than ever in my life prior, I will say this. In spite of the evil shaping our land, there is good at work too. You were corrupted by the darkness, but the light saved you, made you whole again. Koranti might pat himself on the back and say his machines did it, but the mutagen is what changed you, not his scalpels. Our rescue efforts found you before those scoundrels in the Organs could work their wicked deeds, a significant feat all things considered. Perhaps you were allowed to be injured to better prepare you, to protect you from what is to come, a gift not afforded to many. Chaos is at work, yes, but Order is as well. We must have faith that the right side will prevail in the end.”

Footsteps clunked over the wooden floor, and from behind the nearest bookshelf, Andrea appeared, red hair tied back in a functional bun, her scoped rifle slung over one shoulder. “Good, you’re up. We’re getting ready to move out. I’ll get you a long gun, and we’ll go over the maps.”

Professor Carheim waved as we left and returned to his studies on the other side of the library, but his words left me deep in thought. It seemed that every time I turned around in this strange county, I found myself confronted with another earth-shattering worldview, another compelling explanation for the current predicament we were in. Adam Stirling believed God had orchestrated it all, Dr. O’Brian viewed it as an accident of nature through evolution, and Professor Carheim was convinced there were cosmic powers beyond our comprehension working to bring about their own desires. As for myself, I had no idea what to think. I was certainly more open to the idea of God now than when I’d first arrived, but Professor Carheim’s theory seemed quite plausible as well. The thought that I might be some kind of marionet on a supernatural stage made my stomach knot up; I couldn’t help but be reminded of the crude Puppet art, and the tall, foreboding figure of the Oak Walker that ruled over them with lines running from its hands like kite strings.

*Do they have souls? Are they trapped in there, like I was in that surgical tank, unable to resist the roots? Does that mean I’m a murderer for all the ones I’ve killed?*

Andrea led me to the station checkpoint, where I was handed a well-worn pump action shotgun, and a pouch to hook to my belt that contained a small handful of red plastic buckshot shells. A cheap, cracked plastic flashlight had been taped to the foregrip, the sling little more than a strip of old belt glued together. It wasn’t until the final checkpoint before the gloomy frontier of the sewer system that we met up with the rest of the scouts, twelve of us huddled around Andrea as she shone a light on her little paper map.

“We’ve got several miles of tunnel to go through before we get in range of the feed mill.” She traced a meandering line on the white paper, her finger almost the same shade. “Remember, we’re not there to fight; we just get in, count how many we can see, lay some mines, and scoot. If these things figure out we’re there, they will try to swarm us, so don’t stick around after you drop one. Questions?”

No one said anything, the faces in the circle tense and grim. Most of the scouts were teenagers, nimble and small, perfect for this kind of thing. A few of the younger girls whispered to each other when my back was turned, and in spite of the tunnel ambience around me, my eardrums picked up their words like they had shouted them.

“Hey, that’s her.”

“Did you see her eyes?”

“I heard the tattoos can move on their own.”

*Thank God I didn’t have this ability in high school, I would have hidden in my room for days.*

My face burned in humiliation, but I kept a calm expression as best I could and followed the rest of the column out into the storm drains.

In the cool darkness of the sewer system, I let myself relax, and purposefully sought the welling sensation in my head. Steady practice in my corner of the underground library had yielded better results each time, and I discovered I could summon the focus at will. I couldn’t do it for too long however, as it sometimes gave me bad nosebleeds, and a migraine worse than any I’d ever had in my life.

Still, it was fascinating to me what I could do, and I walked along in the dark, breathing, feeling, tasting, smelling, and hearing everything. The light *clink* of gear on one of the scout’s belts. Water rushing somewhere a few tunnels down. A sour discarded potato peel rotting in the trough where it had washed down from the street. Stale sweat from the nervous brows of my companions. My own heartbeat in my chest, pumping gushes of blood through me in a superhighway of veins and arteries.

*Imagine what it would be like with . . . no don’t start that, not now.*

Pain flared over curiosity the instant my mind brought up Chris, and I screwed my eyes shut, the sensation slipping away. As much as I hated myself for it, I’d begun to sink back into the lavish thoughts I’d been having before he’d kissed Jamie. Like a side effect of a drug, the resulting dreams were even more vivid thanks to my new senses, and the focus came stronger when I dreamed of Chris. They had yet to disturb my slumber completely, but always left me feeling empty and frustrated once I awoke to realize it wasn’t real. It hurt like a knife in my heart to want him this bad, to ache for his touch like it was water, and I a desert, especially when I knew it was hopeless.

Gritting my teeth, I thought instead about a nice hot pizza, one with gooey cheese and a garlic-buttered crust, covered in extra amounts of juicy Italian sausage. Yes, that was better. I just had to drool over a steaming pizza, and not think about him at all. I couldn’t let myself picture Chris standing under the shower head in his bathroom, those satin-steel muscles gleaming with streams of crystalline water, and the way it would have lit a fire in my core if he reached out to drag me in with him. . .

*Clackity-clackity-clack.*

Jolted from my self-inflicted torment, I stopped, and snapped my head around to the left.

One of the scouts behind me bumped into my back. “Hey, what’s the hold—”

“Shhh.” I raised a finger to my lips, and clawed for that feeling inside of me, desperate to get it back as the former distractions faded in lieu of fear. The sound had been close, a few tunnels over, but still far enough to be out of the auditory range of my fellow scouts. Multiple legs, maybe four to eight, moved at speed, and I wondered how good the hearing or vibration sensitivity for these creatures was.

If I could hear them, could they also hear, smell, or sense us?

Andrea halted the column, and her eyes drilled into mine in the dark. “What is it?”

The focus slowly returned, and as it did, my skin prickled in a mass of goosebumps.

*They’re everywhere.*

Wooden clacks moved in the distance, clicked back and forth as dozens upon dozens of legs skittered over the cement. They weren’t far off now, but the patters of their sentries moved in wide loops around outer cordons of their hive. Like an enormous colony of ants, they were hard at work, I could sense it in their casual steps, and a ripple of unease slithered through me at how many there were.

“We’re close.” I whispered, mouth slightly agape so I could hear better.

One of the other girls in the column threw Andrea a skeptical glance. “What’s she talking about? I don’t hear anything.”

“Doesn’t mean there isn’t something there.” Andrea took one look at my face, and hers hardened into a serious frown. “Everyone, go dark and stay quiet. Hannah, you’re with me on point.”

One by one the various flashlights up and down our line flickered out, and hands reached for the body in front of them to hook lanyards with karabiners onto belt loops. With this long string connecting us, no one could wander off in the dark, and we could communicate with a series of tugs and pulls on the cord instead of talking. At the very front of the column, I switched my shotgun’s light off, and took a few moments in the dark to relax.

*Wow.*

It was still dim, so shadowy that I felt as if I were seeing through an old-fashioned television storm of grayish haze, but slowly my eyes began to see the world in visible gray lines instead of abyssal black.

A few tugs came at the cord between me and Andrea.

*Good to go?*

I sucked in a gulp of damp air and reached back to jerk the paracord line in response.

*Follow me.*

Through the darkness we crept, like predators from another time, another world long before the age of electric lights and motor cars. Our caves had been replaced with tunnels, our spears with firearms, and our furs with cotton, wool, and synthetics. Gone were the care-free steps of a species confident in its global dominance; now we slunk through the abyss like our ancient ancestors, for fear of the prehistoric nightmares that lay in wait. Humanity had come full circle, and yet we were still too stubborn to die, the one trait that had been our salvation from the beginning of time. We had tasted the light of the gods, of technology, and we couldn’t go back to the cold shadow of ignorance without a struggle.

At an intersection of four storm drains, I paused, and my eyes caught the flicker of movement in the first tunnel to my left.

*Another sentry. They’re smart, sending them out like that. We’ll never get close unless we . . .*

“*Achoo*.” One of the scouts in the column behind me sneezed, and all the clacks in the underground hive went silent.

*Thump-thump.*

I didn’t even have to turn around to feel the cringed tension in the others, the fear palpable in the air, acidic on the back of my tongue.

*Thump-thump.*

My heart boomed like a cannon in my ears, the air caught in my lungs, and I pressed one trembling thumb to the round safety on my shotgun.

*Tok-tok, tok, tok-tok-tok.*

From the tunnel to my left, a wooden appendage tapped out some kind of primordial signal, and as one, the underground ruptured in a stampede of insectoid legs.
