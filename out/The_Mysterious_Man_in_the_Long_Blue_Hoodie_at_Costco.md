Hey everyone, gather 'round. I've got a creepy tale to share with you that's been unraveling right within the aisles of the infamous Costco. Now, I know what you're thinking - creepy stuff at the wholesale store? But I swear to you, this is no ordinary occurrence. Brace yourselves for the unsettling tale of the mysterious man in the long blue hoodie that keeps following me around Costco.  
As an employee at Costco, I'm no stranger to the hustle and bustle of the massive warehouse. However, things took an eerie turn when I noticed a presence out of the corner of my eye. At first, I dismissed it as a mere coincidence, after all, Costco attracts all sorts of customers. But this was different.  
Every time I turned to get a better look, it was as if the man vanished into thin air. Feeling unnerved, I reached for my radio to alert my fellow employees, but no response came. Silence. It was as if the airwaves had completely died. And when I mustered up the courage to approach another staff member, this mysterious man would inexplicably disappear.  
To make matters worse, this strange occurrence became more frequent with each passing day. Whenever I spotted him, I felt the temperature drop, and an indescribable unease settled deep within my bones. It was as if time stood still, and all the surrounding sounds faded into the background.  
Is this some twisted game? Or is there something far more sinister at play here? The more I think about it, the more I dread going about my daily duties. I'm constantly on edge, always checking my surroundings, but he's always one step aheadâ€”playing hide-and-seek with my sanity.  
I've tried to capture evidence, snapping quick photos with my phone, but every time I look back, he's nowhere to be seen. It's as if he possesses supernatural powers, vanishing into the shadows when discovered. My mind races with theories, wondering if this strange man is even human, or just a figment of my overactive imagination.  
The most chilling moment happened during my most recent shift. As I walked down an empty aisle, I noticed the long blue hoodie hanging off the rack. My heart trembled, and a sense of dread washed over me. Was this a sign? I cautiously approached, only to find an empty sleeve swaying gently in the cold air.  
I couldn't take it anymore. The fear, the paranoia, and the unanswered questions weighed heavily on me. As soon as my shift ended, I bolted for the exit, desperate to escape the clutches of this haunting mystery. But as I made my way through the sliding doors, the man was there, standing ominously beneath the Costco sign. His eyes met mine, sending a chill down my spine before he simply melted away into the crowd.  
Now, I can't help but constantly relive those chilling encounters. The long blue hoodie serves as a haunting reminder of those inexplicable moments, and the unanswered questions linger in my mind. Who is this mysterious man? Why is he always one step ahead? And most importantly, what does he want?  
So, fellow Redditors, be warned. The next time you find yourselves roaming through the never-ending aisles of Costco, keep an eye out for the man in the long blue hoodie. Perhaps he's just an ordinary customer or maybe something far more sinister. Either way, dear friends, be on your guard, stay safe, and be prepared to face the spine-tingling enigma that haunts these wholesale corridors.
