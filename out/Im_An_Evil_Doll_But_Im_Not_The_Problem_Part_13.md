
For anyone who missed last week.

“Never thought I’d see one in person.” Hyve says, astounded. 

“Seconded” Kaz adds

“Thirded. “ Leo chimes in. 

“Three and a half-ed I guess?” I finish. 

A bit of gallows humor as the morbidity and horror of the situation sinks in. 

JP is dead ten feet behind us, Outside are at least three dozen of the bishop’s agents. If we’re lucky most are just human. Judging by the way they move though, I’m guessing not. 

I know a lot of you have been waiting for the reveal on Sveta. Werewolf. There, whoever placed bets, feel free to call your friends and collect. 

But I need to clarify something because when I say werewolf, I know what you’re thinking. 

What stands in the front yard, tossing humans and human shaped entities away like used Kleenex is so much more than that. 

I’ve stood in front of creatures, entities, demons, malignant, and a lot of things in between. Even from my point of view, they were all scary as hell. 

But the twenty foot demigod in front of me. This avatar of rage and nature, showed me what fear truly was. 

At first the members of the bishop’s congregation draw firearms and start to unload. Panicked as they are, their shots can’t miss the nearly structure sized creature. 

The bullets didn’t bounce off, or leave a wound that heals instantly, they simply did nothing. No rational or irrational force, no magic field, no ward, just, nothing. As if the universe itself was saying “Don’t bother.”.

Quickly, those in charge stop this despite Sveta beginning to tear through members of the congregation with ease. 

Leo smirks. 

“What’s on your mind?” I ask. 

“ Whatever they have boosting the wards, it’s reaching it’s limit. Makes sense, I don’t care who you are, it’s a bit fucking difficult to hide a werewolf. 

They can’t pull out the literal big guns. Not that it’d do them any good, but it gives me an idea. “ Leo answers, clearly formulating a plan. 

“So she can win this thing, right?” I continue. 

“ God no. Once the shock wears off, someone will figure out what’s going on and radio home base. 

But it’s going to take time, things aren’t as simple as a silver bullet. And even if they were, who the hell carries around silver bullets anymore? There’s two werewolves left, and I’m fairly certain no vampires. 

We cause enough of a scene, they’re going to back off before the ward blows. Then we find a way to calm Sveta down, and get the hell out of dodge. 

You have no idea how important it is that she doesn’t get killed. And I don’t have the week it would take to explain . “ Leo explains. 

“If you’d have told me in my younger days I’d be dying for a cause I’d have laughed at you.” Hyve says.

“If someone told me I’d be doing so beside a Hero, I’d have killed them. “ Kaz adds. 

Both him and Hyve share a chuckle at this. 

“You three, sharpen your claws, or whatever you do, I need to go down in the basement and get ready to do a bunch of stupid shit. “ Leo announces. 

I think about using the proxy, but the thought of getting destroyed and leaving a rabid doll for the bishop to capture, doesn’t sit right with me. 

Hyve begins to slowly grow, insects of every form starting to scuttle into the house en masse. By the end he’s a massive, twisted abomination, plastic stretched thin enough to be transparent, filled with writing insects and organic masses I hesitate to call organs. 

Kaz limbers himself, contorting joints in ways no human could ever hope. His bones and muscles undulate below his skin, the pale, long limbed entity rearranging his body into dozens of configurations like a twisted form of yoga, or maybe flesh origami. 

Me, I just watch, enthralled with the way blows simply lose their force when Sveta is struck or how fire snuffs itself out around her. I’ve seen things bend the rules of the universe, but a decent portion of those rules simply don’t seem to want anything  to do with something like Sveta. 

From the basement is the smell of ozone ( or so I was told) and the sounds of power tools. The battle outside, a one sided melee, rages for ten minutes before Leo comes up the stairs. 

More than I’ve seen yet, the man is armed for bear. 

Modified pistols, something I’ll call a shotgun for lack of a better term,  esoteric looking devices and weapons of various forms sit in holsters and belt loops. Where a bloody, bandaged stump once was, a hastily welded, blued steel fist sits, giving the middle finger. 

“We’re twenty minutes away from death and you took the time to be edgy?” I say pointing to the hand. 

Leo chuckles.

“Couldn’t replace it with something functional, so I had to improvise. “ the hero begins, grabbing the middle finger with his other hand and twisting it off, revealing a nasty looking carbon metal spike, “ I’m no pizza cutter . If it’s edgy, it’s got to have a point.”

It's times like this when it hits me just how complex this world of darkness is. Leo’s best friend is laying dead on the floor, chances are our  grim fate is outside, but the Hero is still cracking wise. There’s something about that energy, that vibe, it’s just as much a part of our survival as bullets, blades, and the paranormal. 

We stand at the doorway, taking in the scene before us. 

“Kaz, you and Hyve go try and minimize casualties, and get Sveta calmed down. A lot of these folks have gotten an offer they can’t refuse, and I don’t want her having to deal with innocent blood on her hands when she comes to. 

Punch, you’re with me, we’re going to try and find where they’re tapping into the wards.” Leo explains. 

“And how do you suggest we calm down a Lycan?” Hyve asks. 

“Couldn’t tell you, but between the two of you, there’s millennia of experience, figure it out. “ Leo replies. 

A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. My first step was followed by a small calibre round bouncing off of my metallic skull. 

Leo grabs me, rushing to take cover behind the nearest car. Hyve and Kaz cautiously make their way to the melee taking place between Sveta and the congregation. 

“Where are those shots coming from?” I ask, fear starting to flood through me. 

“Can’t tell, but whoever it is, they’re good. That’s a .22 maybe a .38 and he’s making shots from far enough away I’m not seeing muzzle flash. “ Leo answers , as a handful of rounds hit the car. 

Leo risks putting his head up for a moment to survey the scene. A shot lands close enough to graze his cheek with bullet fragments and shrapnel. 

“See that van near the end of the block? They’ve got to be in there. “ the Hero says.

A red dot appears on Sveta, another almost inaudible pop. This time though, a small patch of fur looks singed. 

She howls in rage, and without missing a beat picks up a member of the congregation and hurls it at a house on the far end of the street. 

There a horrific crunching noise as the agent’s body is shattered against a peaked roof, a splatter of blood, and a small muzzle flash as a shot goes extremely wide. 

“Now, go!” Leo yells, sprinting to a pickup truck closer to the possible source of the ward interference. 

 The group surrounding the van has taken notice. What I’m guessing is their leader, a square jawed man in a tweed suit yells to the congregation and points in our direction. 

Eight members of the Bishop’s congregation walk toward us, each armed with some kind of hand to hand weapon. 

“Keep an eye on these, I’m counting two entities, six idiots. I’m going to try and keep things PG-13.” Leo says, placing down the shotgun and some of the nastier looking pieces from his newly made arsenal.

He stands up, hands raised, not in surrender, but to show he’s empty handed at the moment. 

“It’s been a blast, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you fine folks to leave. “ Leo says, amicably.

A woman with short black hair and wild eyes wearing an ill fitting pantsuit chuckles. She brandishes a short, thick machete with its tip ground to a fine point. 

This causes a man next to her, a fifty year old who looks like he has no business being in any kind of altercation to join in. He tightens his grip on a carbon steel survival hatchet. 

“Let’s not start things off like that. 

You, lurch looking mother-fucker, I know you aren’t going to see sense. Same with your buddy trying to hide his empty eye sockets with sunglasses, at night, in 2025. 

But you other six, you aren’t getting out of this alive. The war is only going to end one way, I’ll admit that. But you guys need to be thinking about the battle. “ Leo grins, as if he isn’t the one completely outmatched. 

Without being in the proxy, I can’t see it, but I can just about feel the forces Leo is working with as a physical sensation. He’s in his element, this is what people like him were made for as much as committing horror is why I was created. 

I look to Sveta as Leo continues, weaving that strange kind of spellwork he’s capable of.  

At first I thought she was slaughtering the members of the congregation, but the more I watch, the more I get it. She’s not looking to take out her rage on the group, she’s trying to track down the person who shot JP. 

Which isn’t to say some of the Bishop’s congregation don’t become members of the red mist society, but she’s responding, stopping those who get in her way not killing indiscriminately. 

Kaz and Hyve scream to her, as they keep the more capable entities away. Twice she turns and looks, her piercing green eyes showing understanding, not truly lost to some kind of ancient rage. 

But she’s pissed, and in every way, she’s came by that feeling honestly. 

When I look back to Leo, he’s staring down a young, pale man in a short sleeved dress shirt, making threats and promises that could rust the hull of a tank. Leo’s charismatic shamanism taking on a nearly physical force. 

Four of the humans make a break for it, whether fear or good sense inspired the retreat, it still significantly improves Leo’s odds. 

The short haired woman, and a balding man with a crooked grin stand beside the two entities. Leo nods slightly as if approving.  

He slowly raises the metal hand, it’s symbolic gesture obvious. The congregation members are visibly angered by the mockery. 

The man with the twisted smile takes a step forward, a small hunting spear in his hand, wide, flat metal blade catching the light from the streetlamps. 

Before he can take his second step Leo deftly twists the heavy steel case from the middle finger of the  prosthetic hand, and in almost the same motion throws it at the cultist. 

A sickening crunch and the man hits the ground screaming, trying to hold together pulped nose and cheekbone. 

The woman charges Leo heedless of her own safety. It catches the hero off-guard.  He doesn’t mind sending these people to the hospital, but he wants to avoid sending them to Jesus. 

His hesitation costs him a slash across the forehead. He backhands the woman as he tries to wipe blood out of his eyes, but she seems to barely notice the blow. 

I’m worried for him as the eyeless entity starts to silently walk toward the Hero. 

My obliviousness costs me a kick to the midsection hard enough to dent  the door of the pickup. 

The massive, waxen skinned entity stands in front of me. Head impossibly angular, hands the size of frying pans, it grins down at me with flat, almost equine teeth. From this distance it’s clear this thing is nothing close to human. 

“The Bishop says there’s a special place in hell for traitors. “ The entity says stalking toward me with a confidant gait, “It’ll seem like paradise after I’m done with you.”

In a flash the massive abomination reaches down. I avoid being grabbed by sheer luck. I hit the ground and start to scuttle backward.

But I’m not in peak condition, JP’s repairs got me on my feet, but my joints are grinding and hitching. 

A boot stomps hard enough to crack asphalt, blocking my escape. 

Leo is keeping the woman and the eyeless thing at bay, but he can’t make headway. He’s devoting too much time to trying to take the woman out of the fight without killing her. Evil or no, this lady feels no pain. 

Things are looking grim, the thing looming over me is faster than it has any right to be at it’s size. It’s taking everything in me to simply not get crushed like an insect. 

The thing in front of me starts to become frustrated, at first I think I can use this. That thought lasts all of about 3 seconds. 

It takes me a second to realize he’s ripped a door off of the pickup truck. He wields it as if it’s nothing more than a pack of cigarettes and I’m an uninvited spider. 

He slams it down, no way to escape I’m crushed between it and the road. Head ringing, pain bolting through my remaining flesh. He twists the door, grinding me between it and the ground. 

The entity casually tosses the mangled wreck of steel and plastic away, scowling down at me with satisfaction. 

I’m hurt, but not dead. The steel in the door was made to crumple during an impact, but thankfully, my skull plate wasn’t.  But I can barely move , my consciousness starts to fade in and out.

The towering entity smirks down at me, slowly raising one foot. He doesn’t use his unnatural speed, he doesn’t need to, it’s taking everything in me just to remain aware. 

He starts to press down, I can hear my skull plate begin to strain, feel the connections between it and my flesh start to buckle and tear. 

My life doesn’t flash before my eyes, but I do think of all the people that are going to be hurt because I wasn’t  good enough. 

I accept my fate, taking my gaze from the entity, wanting my last sight to be something other than his dead-fleshed, visage. 

Then I see it. Guess I’m not the only well made instrument of violence on the street. 

Most of the items Leo left were destroyed by the door, but that oversized, NRA wet-dream of a shotgun he created, sits just under the pickup. Inches away from my grasp. 

I twist and squirm, my horrific pained screams mixing with the squealing of abused steel. Porcelain hands chip and crack as I try to drag them closer to the weapon. 

The entity doesn’t see the barrel, and probably wouldn’t care if he did. The twisted pleasure it’s taking at my struggle has it enraptured. 

The angle is awkward, one ceramic digit snaps as I put all my force into trying to pull that trigger. 

The shot tears another door from the pickup and sends the weapon spinning into the night. One of the entities legs evaporates from the knee down. It begins to fall, it's a full second before the square headed, necromantic looking creature begins to scream in pain and shock. 

The thundercrack of the firearm gives Leo an idea, he draws a hefty looking pistol and fires it into the air. 

The eyeless entity looks as shocked as something without ocular organs can and focusses on the pistol. Clearly under orders to keep the strain on the ward down. 

It's all the chance Leo needs. The entity grabs his arm, trying to wrest the weapon away. Leo buries the spike on his free ‘hand’ into the back of the thing’s skull. It hits the ground twitching, trying and failing to crawl away. 

The woman rushes him, holding the machete high. The hero’s kick shatters ribs, and dislocates a shoulder but leaves the woman cursing and wailing on the ground, alive. 

Leo picks up the shotgun, cracking it’s soda can sized barrel, and inserting another massive shell. He walks over casually, as if this entire street isn’t turning into a supernatural war. 

Properly aimed, the second shot evaporates the necromantic horror on the ground in front of me from the shoulders up. 

Leo reaches down, offering me a hand, “We make a good team. Let’s go make a complaint to the assistant manager over there. “

I take it, and we both look toward the van. Leo looking like divine retribution and me trying to hide the fact that I’m scared shitless. 

“It’s just the guy in the used car salesman’s suit, and whoever the battery is inside the van. “ I tell Leo, close enough now I can get a sense of what’s going on.

“Now would be a great time to find a better path in life. “ Leo says as we start to walk toward the van. 

“My path is righteous,  genuinely enjoyable, and boring, heathen. 

 But your little friend, how he got here, that’s an interesting journey. “ the man in the tweed suit says. 

“Sent to kill a kid and his parents in a decade or so, yeah, I’ve been reading the reddit posts too. “ Leo says dismissively. 

“I love how hunters spend their lives with the unknown, but still think they know about it. 

The hubris, the audacity. You really think what you’ve been spoon fed is the entire story?” The man leans against the van, relaxed. 

“I don’t care how or why he got here. You can sow your discord somewhere else. “ Leo pulls out a revolver as he speaks. 

“Typical, when you’re a hammer, every problem looks like a nail I guess. 

But ask yourself something. What if the marionette there volunteered for the position? What kind of person would do that? 

I could be lying of course, like you said, trying to sow discord. But then why couldn’t your dead buddy find anything on who he was? “ The suit wearing man smirks, something about what he said seems to have struck a cord with Leo. 

The engines blend into the background noise of the conflict at first. But then we see them at the end of the block. Three vans just like the one sitting in front of us.

“Kind of depressing you’ll be chewing on those questions for the rest of your lives. Chin up though, that’s only going to be about ten minutes.” The Bishop’s underling taunts. 

“ Fall back to the house!” Leo says.

“What about Sveta?” I reply, following him. 

“Not must use to her dead, are we? There’s at least three more human batteries in those vans, and I’m guessing a shitload of the Bishops best in cars behind them. 

Dying for a cause is one thing, meaningless sacrifice is another. “ Leo explains. 

Whoever was on the roof has their bearings, shots hit around us in a tightening grouping. 

As we retreat I see Sveta, Hyve and Leo. 

“For fuck sakes! Can the universe stop jamming it down our throat for one second!” Leo exclaims, letting me know he’s seeing the same thing. 

The humans have backed away, but Sveta is being swarmed by the most competent of the bishops scouts. They aren’t doing damage, but the dozen or so entities manage to hold on, slowing her down, preventing her from putting any one of them down for good. 

We stand by the front door, the bishops fleet slowing itself to a crawl. The air feels thick as they work their vile power, the ward becoming stronger with every second. 

It hits me then. For all my fear, at least I’m an active participant in this. Not those poor bastards around us though. Those families caught in the middle of this pissing contest. 

The stuff of nightmares prowls their neighbourhood, their lives a hair’s width from ending. But that’s not the part that scares me. 

It’s the mental invasion, the ward reaching in and twisting memories and sights. How many of these people are going to lose loved ones, and be saddled with some unshakeable feeling that how they remember things, wasn’t how it really happened? 

The three vans fan out, flanking a half dozen SUVs and station wagons. 

What comes out of them radiates evil and power. Probably not the Bishop’s A team, but a cut above the slaves and minor entities we’ve seen. 

“God-damn numbers game is the problem. “ Leo says, confidence gone from his voice. His tone that of a traumatized war vet. 

Hyve and Kaz have their hands full, I’ve got no tricks left to play, and none of us have any friends in a position to help. 

“What do we do?” I say, watching powerful entities, and militaristically armed humans start to form ranks. 

A trained square of cheap suits, claws, and firearms that are illegal in any sane country plods toward us. 

“I’m out of cool shit to say punch. We pick a window and fire through it till the bricks crumble. 

I’m sorry for the way I’ve been treating you. You’re not just some pipe bomb. You’ve shown more humanity than most humans I know. “ Leo says, intending to turn into the house and meet his fate. 

But for once in this power jog through hell, the universe throws us a bone. 

We hear the engine long before we see the large, white U-Haul like vehicle. It sounds like a dying beast, windows rattle as it speeds down the street. 

Heat pours off of the engine compartment in a haze, overclocked engine running nearly red hot. 

It hits the back rank of cars fast enough to make them scatter like bowling pins. I don’t know much about trucks, but clearly this thing has been reinforced. It doesn’t so much as slow down. 

Two of the vans get clipped, tearing side panels away, revealing tortured looking individuals hooked up to all manner of ungodly and unscientific machinery. 

The tight knit battalion of the Bishop’s soldiers try to scatter, but the street is narrow, their own cars box them in. Half of them ( I’m guessing the human half.) are either killed instantly, or lay dying and screaming on the asphalt. 

I see who’s strapped into a roll cage behind the wheel for a second before they jackknife the moving van. The tall, square vehicle thrown into a tumbling, spark spewing flight, lands on it’s side a few feet in front of us. 

The driver unbuckles dozens of straps, disengages the roll cage, and crawls out of a now doorless side of the truck.  

The chaos causes the ward the visibly strain, the night sky around us takes on a grey tone for a brief moment. 

“Mike?” Leo says, astounded. 

“Aka, the guy you assholes left to die with a handful of demons.” Mike replies, walking over. 

I can’t think of how to describe the way Mike looked other than to say, he fit right in with the menagerie of lunatics and monsters around us. 

The black tuxedo with yellow trim was clearly clown related, but more ‘ French art film’ than bozo. His makeup was almost, subtle. Not warpaint, just, fitting, I guess is the right word. 

“Don’t worry, all that is behind us now. “ Mike explains, though I don’t like the lopsided grin on his face. 

“You’re here to help?” Leo asks. 

“That makes it sound like I’m doing this for free. 

I’ve got 2 things I want. Or I’m more than happy to just walk away from this little jackpot you have found yourselves in. “ Mike offers. 

“See what’s going on? The literal running battle here? Not going to be solved with a car crash and a Juggalo. “ Leo retorts. 

“I’m actually more upset about that comment than you leaving me for dead. 

Boys!” Mike slaps the side of the truck, and seemingly on que, something kicks out the back doors hard enough to embed them into a nearby car. 

I’ve seen some of the people, and things that pour out before. It’s a mix of prisoners and guards from Pi’s place. I couldn’t be more confused. 

“You brought an army. How the…You know what, nevermind. What do you want?” Leo says, at least as perplexed as I am. 

“First, I want to give JP’s toybox the old once over. You’re right, I have an army, but I need equipment. 

Second, if we come out on top, you’re going to tell a very specific story about tonight. You’re going to tell it to anyone that will listen. I need a reputation, you see. “ Mike states. 

The smell of burning plastic and fuel , the chemical haze of flaming wreckage, makes the entire situation feel even more surreal than it is. 

“Even when help arrives it’s a profiteer. Sure clown, take your payment, give me your script. Now, are we going to stand here being melodramatic, or do we start taking heads?” Leo says.

“I can always go for a little head. “ Mike replies displaying an arsenal of his own expertly hidden within his suit-jacket. 

And for obvious reasons, I’ll be ending things there for tonight. This is our chance, one mistake, one more bit of bad luck, and it’s all over. 

If there’s no next time, I just want to say, without you guys, I don’t know what I would be doing right now. You have kept me motivated, kept me trying to be more than what I was made to be. 

And for that, I thank all of you. 

Punch
