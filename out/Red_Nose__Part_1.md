They say that evil wears many faces. But no one ever told me it could wear a bright red nose and a smile that never moved.

My name’s Marcus—Mark, to everyone who knows me. I’m sixteen, and I live in St. Elora’s Catholic Orphanage. It's a cold, gray place built back in the 1800s. You know, the kind of building where the walls feel like they’re always listening. But it’s home. Or at least, the closest thing to it.

My days are usually the same—school, chores, then a few hours with my friends before curfew. My crew? We’re a loud, chaotic mess. Coraline, the smartest—and easily the most beautiful—girl in the group. She’s my crush, not that I’d ever say it out loud. Then there’s Daryl, my best friend since we were eight. Tall, dark-skinned, funny, and the chillest person alive. Matt and Cory—polar opposites. Matt’s the muscle, always carrying Cory’s scrawny little nerd self around like luggage. Stacy’s too glamorous for this place, or so she thinks. Grace is quiet, soft-spoken, always hiding behind her hair and glasses. And finally, the twins—Jack and Jamie. Mischievous little pranksters. You could never tell them apart if it weren’t for the mole on Jack’s cheek.

That day started like any other. Breakfast in the old stone dining hall, then off to Bishop Francis High. Coraline sat across from me on the bus, neat bun in place, green eyes buried in her textbook. She always looked too serious for someone our age.

"You're staring again," Daryl muttered beside me, smirking.

"I'm not," I replied, too quickly.

"Right. And I’m the Pope."

The day passed in a blur—geometry with Mrs. Delacroix, who still pronounced my name wrong, and history with Mr. Bennett, who smelled like soup. After school, we went back to the orphanage, played some basketball on the cracked court behind the chapel, and hung out until Sister June rang the bell for evening prayers.

That’s when it started.

As I walked back to my dorm, I saw something—just a flash—at the corner of my eye. A blur of white and red ducking behind a hallway corner. I spun around.

Nothing.

I waited. Still nothing.

Maybe it was one of the twins pulling a prank.

I brushed it off. I shouldn’t have.

The next day, something felt... wrong.

Everyone was at lunch, sitting on the field near the fence, but I felt restless. Like something was watching me. I didn’t want to admit it, but I kept glancing behind me, half-expecting to see that blur again.

After school, instead of heading back through town, I took a shortcut—through the old trail behind the orphanage. The forest.

The deeper I walked, the quieter everything got.

Birdsong stopped. The wind didn’t rustle the trees. Even my footsteps felt muted, like the ground didn’t want to make a sound. That’s when I saw him.

About twenty feet ahead.

A figure, standing dead still between two trees.

It looked like a clown—but wrong. The body was *human-shaped*, but it was like something pretending to be human. The face was stiff and too symmetrical. Its eyes were wide, unblinking. The red nose on its face looked fresh, too bright, almost wet. Its clothes were colorful but faded, like they were decades old. And its smile... it wasn’t moving, just stretched across its face like it had been painted on with a knife.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe.

Then it tilted its head slowly—like it was studying me.

I bolted.

Didn’t stop until I was back inside the orphanage, heart punching my ribs. I knew I saw something. I *knew* it.

That night, I called a meeting.

We all met in the attic above the boys’ dorm—our hangout spot. Coraline sat on a crate, arms folded, skeptical. Daryl leaned on the wall, munching chips. The others gathered around.

“I saw something. In the woods,” I said, catching my breath.

“A bear?” Matt guessed.

“No, a clown. A *thing*. It wasn’t human.”

"A clown?" Stacy scoffed. "Like red nose and floppy shoes? What, did you trip and hit your head?"

“It was real. Its nose was bright red, and it didn’t move. Like... it was pretending to be a person.”

Cory adjusted his glasses. “Could be a pareidolia effect. You know, the brain sees faces in random patterns—”

“It wasn’t my brain, Cory. It looked at me. It *knew* I was there.”

Coraline leaned forward. “You’re sure?”

I nodded.

“Then we go,” Daryl said simply. “Tomorrow. After classes.”

The next day, just before sundown, we made the walk. Twenty minutes into the forest, flashlights in hand, shoes crunching on dead leaves.

We searched. For over an hour.

Nothing.

“Maybe it left,” Grace said softly.

“No,” I said. “It’s here.”

“Let’s split,” Coraline suggested. “Cover more ground.”

Bad idea.

But we did it.

Me and Coraline. Daryl with Stacy. Matt with Grace. The twins went off on their own, giggling like it was all a big joke.

We searched for maybe fifteen more minutes. Then the screaming started.

It was faint at first. A bloodcurdling shriek that echoed through the woods. We all regrouped near the old creek.

“Jack? Jamie?” Matt called, his voice shaking.

Then we saw it.

Near a patch of broken trees, where the soil was disturbed.

Their bodies.

Twisted. Mutilated.

One of them—Jack, I think—was missing his legs. The other’s chest was torn open like paper. And there were *bite marks*. Not normal ones. Wide, jagged, like from a mouth too big for a face.

Near them, carved into the tree in what looked like dried blood, was a crude drawing of a clown face. With one thing colored in bright red:

The nose.

Grace started sobbing. Cory turned green and vomited behind a bush. Coraline gripped my arm so hard her nails dug into my skin.

“We need to go,” Daryl said, voice low. “Now.”

We ran. No one said a word until we were back at the orphanage.

At 8:02 PM, we locked ourselves in the library. We had to know. We couldn’t go to the police—not after sneaking out and leaving the scene. They wouldn’t believe us anyway.

Cory pulled books on folklore, local legends, anything he could find. We spread them out across the table, the air thick with fear and silence.

And that’s when we found it. In a journal from 1947, written by a priest who once ran the orphanage:

We looked at each other.

No one said a word.

We didn’t have to.

Something was coming for us.

And we had just begun.
