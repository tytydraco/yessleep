When someone asks a theoretical question about the first person to do anything, it's usually not about death. However, that's a question I've been pondering for years, since I became a mortician.


Since I work with the dead, it's only a natural thing to ask yourself or colleagues. However, usually, someone will say something along the lines of, "maybe it was an accident" or "maybe his friend got pissed and played a bit too rough." But never, ever do I get an actual answer.


Until last year.


I met a guy. An old guy, very, very old guy.
And his name, was Michael, not how you would pronounce it, but Mic-i-el. But it's spelled Michael. Anyway, he's the only one who gave me a somewhat serious answer, saying:



"The first person who died is still alive, and he's in agony. In hell on earth, and if you have a death wish yourself, he's a good way to end yourself."



It freaked me out, the answer he gave, but after awhile, I got curious. Too curious for my own good.
I asked him, "oh? And how do you figure that?"
I wish I'd never asked him that.



"I've met him, and he's a vengeful spirit, a spirit not to be trifled with. Best you don't ask anymore boy."



I don't believe him, obviously, on the assumption he's a lunatic.



But now, I'm nothing but haunted by that non-belief. The next night I had a nightmare. Of a man being burned, burned on a stake. The fire was blue, and he was screaming bloody Mary.



"I WILL NOT BE HINDERED BY THIS ACT! I WILL NOT BE HINDERED BY THIS ACT!", Over and over, until I woke up, and when I did, my ear was bleeding.



I sought out that man, but couldn't find him, and searched him online, only for no results at all, not even a single fake description.
Until I realized that the man in the dream and the man i'd talked to, were the exact same.



At the time I'd had no idea why they were the same person, but now, I know it's because he had invoked The First person to die's spirit.



And I will be next if I speak it, so I dare not to.



However last week, a man, who has a similar experience with a similar old guy. And his name is Johnathan, or just John.



He's a 32 year old man who, before all this, was just a guy with a 9/5 job behind a standing desk.



Now, he's trying to inform people of the first to die without invoking his fury.
He came to me and described a man, burning at the stake, with an azure flame, and then I took him to the side, asked him how he knew, and ever since, to kill, or re-kill the first to die, so that he doesn't take more innocent people, who are curious. I'll update this more as we find things. And hopefully, we find him, and end his suffering, so he doesn't cause any more suffering for others.
