People like to romanticise farm life. They picture sunsets and fresh cow’s milk, dusty picturesque fields and singing all day to cheerful work. But that’s not the kind of story this is.  
   
This is the story of a scarecrow that was *watching me.*  
   
It began on an evening like any other, one of those nights where the silence felt too thick, like the land itself was holding its breath.  
   
I was aching from chores, my clothes damp with sweat and dirt, my brain fried from the heat and the usual arguments with Mum about homework. I slumped into a chair by the kitchen window with a plate of reheated stew and glanced outside.  
   
That’s when I saw it.  
   
The scarecrow.  
   
It had always stood out in the lower field, crooked and slouched like it had given up scaring birds. But now, I swear its arm had moved.  
   
Just barely. A twitch. A tilt. Then slowly and unnaturally, the limb stretched sideways revealing a rusted scythe clenched in its other hand.  
   
I stared, transfixed on it.  
   
The thing wasn’t blowing in the wind because there was no wind. It was dead still outside, the kind of stillness that makes animals stop in their tracks and listen.  
   
Its head turned.  
Not swung, *turned*.  
   
Intentionally, like a man adjusting his neck after a long sleep.  
   
Its stitched grin pulled wider as its burlap face tightened and for a moment, I felt it looking straight through the glass and into me.  
That terrifying sneer… I’d somehow seen it before.  
   
My breathing stopped and a pressure built in my chest while a scream started forming just under my ribs.  
   
I blinked  
and when I opened my eyes…  
   
It was back to normal.  
It was just a regular scarecrow on the pole again.  
Sagging… quiet… *pretending*.  
   
I forced myself to eat, trying to shake off the feeling. But even in my room behind closed doors, I couldn’t stop checking the window. I told myself it was my imagination.  
Stress. Hunger. Fatigue.  
   
But deep down, I didn’t believe it.  
It felt too real to be my mind playing tricks on me.  
   
The rain came later, slow and steady. It smeared the glass and turned the outside world into a distorted abstract painting. Perhalps a Pollock piece.  
   
The trees swayed in the distance, branches contorting in the wind. The calves were bawling from the barn, anxious and loud like they could sense something was out of place.  
Like they knew someone was out there with them.  
   
And then while gazing into the distance, something obscured my vision  
   
A silhouette.  
   
Not on the pole.  
   
**At my window.**  
   
The scarecrow stood there, face pressed nearly flat against the pane, just inches from mine.  
   
It didn’t tap.  
It didn’t scratch.  
It just stared; a blank, motionless stare.  
   
Its lips curled in what could only be described as eagerness to be let in.  
   
I fell backwards, slamming my head into the wooden floor. The room spun like a grand carousel.  
When I managed to scramble back to my feet, I gasped  
   
There was nothing there.  
   
The rain still fell but the window was almost dry.  
In the reflection, I could see my own face and behind it, for a split second, a flash of black buttons where eyes shouldn’t be.  
   
I checked on Mum and she was in the lounge, her face wet with tears.  
   
“The paper never came,” she said, trying to sound brave, but her voice cracked.  
   
She wasn’t waiting for news about crops or the weather.  
   
She was waiting for word about him.  
   
**My father.**  
   
He’d gone to prison after what he did to her.  
Unspeakable and depraved atrocities that deserve the death penalty.  
   
I used to lie awake at night imagining him getting what he deserved in prison.  
But now… I wasn't so sure.  
   
“He’s not coming back,” I told her. “You know that.”  
   
Even though I had lost confidence, I had to be strong for her.  
I had to protect her.  
Something in the dark was stirring.  
Getting closer every passing second.  
   
By morning, the rain had stopped, but the sky still looked bruised.  
   
I walked out to the field, legs trembling, unsure if it was anger or fear holding me together.  
   
The scarecrow waited.  
   
I stopped a few metres away, staring into that blank, burlap face, mustering up every bit of confidence I had.  
It had dried blood on the fabric.  
Old, sickly brown, crusted deep into the weave.  
   
“You’re not real,” I whispered.  
   
I stepped forward.  
Seized it by the neck.  
   
“Move again, you brainless fuck,” I taunted. “Do it!”  
   
**It moved.**  
   
Not suddenly. Not with force.  
Just with certainty.  
   
Its arms lifted, slow, but solid.  
   
The illusion of straw faded.  
Beneath its sleeves human skin emerged.  
Not normal skin.  
Skin charred and warped, blackened like meat left on an open flame too long.  
   
Fingernails melted to the flesh.  
Snapped bones protruded from split sinew.  
   
It grabbed my wrists with a strength that didn’t belong to an inanimate sack of hay and I couldn’t pull away.  
   
Its face began to peel.  
   
The sackcloth unravelled, thread by thread, as if it was been shut to hide the unspeakable horrors that lay beneath.  
   
It was a man’s face.  
Or what was left of one.  
   
The skin hung in patches, lips fused into a permanent sneer. One eye was gone and in the socket was just a black hole like an endless abyss of depravity.  
   
The other eye, still attached and very human, burned with recognition and malevolence.  
   
“Thomas,” it rasped.  
A voice like a dying and feral animal, wheezing through collapsing lungs.  
“You look just like her.”  
   
The hat blew off, revealing his skull, bare black veins still pulsing faintly across scorched tissue.  
   
He raised the scythe  
and I didn’t have time to scream before it came down.  
   
Metal sank into my shoulder with a wet, crackling crunch.  
   
Pain swallowed me whole.  
   
I felt the blade split through skin, muscle, bone.  
   
My blood poured into the dirt like a cascade.  
I screamed and squirmed until somehow, through blind panic and raw survival instinct, I managed to break free.  
   
I ran like the wind and didn’t look back.  
I couldn’t even if I wanted to.  
   
I bolted to the house, crimson blood dripping with every swift step.  
I slammed the door behind me, my shoulder burning like it was on fire.  
   
“Mum!” I cried.  
   
She turned, pallid as if her soul had been sucked out.  
   
“The paper came,” she stated weakly. Her hands trembled.  
“There was a fire at the prison.”  
   
My mouth was too dry to speak as if my vocal cords had been ripped out.  
I nodded breathlessly in reply.  
   
“It happened two months ago,” she whispered.  
“They don’t know who survived and more importantly, haven’t found any of the escaped inmates.”  
   
My legs went weak.  
   
“Was he on the list of deceased?” I inquired, the fear pervading within my voice.  
   
She didn’t answer  
but I already knew.  
   
“I think he’s already here,” I whispered.  
   
Out there in the fields…  
   
*Waiting.*  
   
We both turned to the window in unison.  
   
The scarecrow was *gone.*
