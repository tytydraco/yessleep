Hey /r/nosleep, I know this might sound strange but I've read some really strange stuff on here and you guys always seem to know what to do. I don't really know how to explain this, so I guess I'll just start at the beginning.

Three days ago, I woke up at four in the morning. I'm normally a late sleeper, so this was pretty unusual, but I figured a noise had caused me to stir. The first thing I noticed was that I couldn't move my arm; looking to my left I saw my husband laying on my shoulder, with his arm around my chest, breathing steadily over the background hum that narrated quiet moments. Not wanting to force him out of the peaceful dreamworld he was likely inhabiting, I grabbed my phone from the nightstand with my other arm, turned the brightness down to minimum and muted the volume, and opened TikTok.

Don't get me wrong, the app isn't exactly my favorite. In fact I don't much care for social media at all. But entertainment is entertainment and none of my favorite YouTube creators have uploaded anything recently. After a few videos about wacky social interactions or some funny skit, i swiped up to find a video of a woman wearing a plain white robe standing in an empty room with yellowish-white walls. She had straight, black hair that looked like it had gone weeks without washing, and her face was dotted with freckles. I figured it was some sort of avant-garde fashion ad, but looking down at the description, I didn't see the label saying the video was promoted.

I was about to swipe away from the odd video when text suddenly appeared on the screen. "Abigail," the words spelled, plainly across the bottom of the video. Looking at the woman again, her expression was still petrified in a slight, uncomfortable smile. The kind you make at your uncle when he gives you a gift you don't want, or that you make to someone who shoots unwanted, but not outright hostile, advances at you in public. That smile caught my eye. That smile looked wrong. The name disappeared from the screen and after a few seconds, the video looped. It wasn't a still image, the woman shifted slightly as she breathed in and out at a regular pace. Her eyes, though, her eyes didn't blink for almost 2 minutes. She just...stared...at the camera. It felt like she was looking straight through my phone screen and at me.  


My husband shifted slightly in his sleep, groaning as he held me tighter, knocking me out of my stupor and causing me to swipe off the frankly disturbing video. I expected a distraction from from the odd experience I'd just had (TikTok is rampant with that kind of thing, to be fair), but what I found just made me more confused.

>\[0\]\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]

I stared into the unmoving image for a few seconds before comprehending that this was not, in fact, a joke video. The app was genuinely asking me if...whatever that was...is relevant to my interests? I quickly selected \[0\] and the app scrolled to the next, perfectly normal video. I watched for a little while longer until I finally felt I could sleep again, and I rolled over on my side and leaned back into my husband for comfort. I shut my eyes, but in the blackness I could still see that woman's eyes staring through my screen. 

Something was wrong with Abigail.

The next day felt just like any other. My husband woke up with me, made me breakfast, and we talked about what we would do that day. We talked about going to see a movie or something, but in the end we wound up cuddled together on the couch watching reruns of our favorite show. I had forgotten about Abigail by then, and I felt at peace again. It was only when he got up to use the bathroom that I pulled out my phone and opened TikTok.

It was the same room. The same barren walls. The same piles of dust you'd expect to see in the back of an ill-utilized closet or some dilapidated corridor. Only this time, the woman was different. She had short, curled brown hair and much darker skin. She still stood in the same pose as Abigail, wearing the same white robe and with the same, petrified, uncomfortable smile on her face. The camera moved slightly, repositioning to be at a straighter angle to her, and her eyes followed the camera's movement. It looked like they were about to crawl out of her head and run away from whatever she stared at. Then, text appeared on the screen: "Bridget." The text persisted for a few more seconds, then the video simply repeated. Now I was both deeply disturbed and curious.

Usually when some weird TikTok phenomenon like this happens, people will do their own interpretations of it, and you can see videos made to the same "sound"--or in this case, lack thereof--pretty easily. This time, there were no others, only the video of Bridget staring creepily into the camera. Looking at the user profile, there were no followers and no other videos posted. The profile picture was just black and the username was a random string of characters. 

It could be some sort of augmented reality game, puzzles and scavenger hunts set up by companies and artists to get the internet interested and promote their products. I thought back to all those weird creepypasta videos that would get sent around YouTube in the late 2000s and thought this might be an attempt at a modern revival. If it was, the acting was very genuine. Strangely though, the video had 0 likes. None. But the comment count read 49. Looking at them, they were all numbers, ranging between the hundreds of thousands and even into the millions. They were round numbers, the sort a human would write, not random digits spouted out by a program.

Drawing me out of my trance was my husband's footsteps growing closer. "Babe, look at this," I said, closing the comments and handing him the phone.

"It says it's been deleted," he said, confused.

"What? I just saw it a few seconds ago"

"Maybe they just posted it and decided to take it down? Whatever it was, I'm sure it was hilarious, Sarah." He kissed my forehead and sat down, and I thought about telling him what I had seen. I tried to describe it, the woman standing in the creepy outfit with the creepy stare in the empty room, but I couldn't quite put it into words how real that face felt. Still, he could tell it had upset me and he made sure I was taken care of extra well that night.

In the end, curiosity got the better of me. When he left for work the next morning, I took out my phone and started scrolling furiously through the posts, trying to find more information about the weird videos. I tried to google for information about some beta test but my efforts yielded nothing. I was close to giving up when I swiped one last time to the next video and nearly threw my phone across the room. 

The same yellow-walled room greeted me, and there was yet again a woman standing in the middle of the room wearing the same plain white robe as the other subjects. But her face was different. Her face was mine. I stared transfixed at my own face in a video I didn't film. The woman had my eyes, my mouth, my nose, my ears, even my fading dyed hair. From what I could see of her body, that was mine as well. She--I--had the same expression on my face as the other women. There's something utterly terrifying about seeing your own face in a place you know it shouldn't be. Especially when it looks like that. Dear reader, I have tried my best to paint a picture of just how scared these women looked. Even with a thousand years and the tutelage of Michelangelo and Van Gogh themselves, I doubt I could accurately convey what I saw when I looked into my face that day. It was like staring into black holes where my eyes should have been, unmistakably mine but twisted by some emotion I had yet to experience in my lifetime. My heart skipped a beat when the text appeared on the screen. "Sarah." My name.

I didn't quite know what to do, so I just stared. The video played a dozen times, never changing. Never freeing me from the confusing reality I had just stumbled into. Each time, I hoped I would stare into that frozen gaze and be met by someone else, some other person than me. I hoped the word "Sarah" would be replaced by anything else. Just as I felt my composure coming back to my stupefied state, I looked down at the video's description. "Posted at 3:00 AM, 2/4/2023." Quickly swiping on my phone to check the time, it read 3:00 PM, 2/3/2023. I screamed for what felt like hours and called my husband to come home.

Writing this now is the only thing I could think to do. I've been a lurker here for a while and I know you guys are great at solving problems. Well, I have a big one. It's 1:08 AM right now and I don't want to end up in that room, wearing that white robe, and staring at what is evidently the most horrifying thing I've never seen. My husband is here and he believes me, but I don't think the police would if I told them. I tried finding the account again so I could download one of those videos but they weren't appearing in my feed anymore. The only thing I did manage to find was another survey
