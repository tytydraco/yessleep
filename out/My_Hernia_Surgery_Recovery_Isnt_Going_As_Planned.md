I had a minor surgery last Thursday. Hernia repair. Nothing invasive, just laparoscopic. In and out. St. Emory Medical wasn’t much to look at… stained tile, buzzing fluorescents, that waiting room stink of sweat and lemon-scented bleach… but the nurses were polite. The anesthesiologist cracked a joke about counting backwards from ten. I remember the mask. The lights above me. The IV burning cold in my arm.

And then…

I woke up in the operating room.

Not the same one. Or maybe just… not the same anymore.

The lights overhead were red and pulsing, dimmer than they should’ve been. The lens covers were clouded and rust-ringed. The walls were lined with trays of used gauze and metal tools soaking in nothing.

The smell was what hit me hardest. Not infection… preservation. Something pickled and raw. Like blood that had been boiled and sealed.

My wrists were strapped down. Not with Velcro. With leather. Old, cracked, soaked-through.

There was movement beside me. A nurse. That’s what my brain told me first.

Short skirt, white uniform stained at the hem. Her stockings were stretched tight over pale thighs, clinging with friction like they’d been pulled on over damp skin. Her mask pressed hard against her mouth, but you could see the shape beneath… lips parted like she was always mid-breath.

Her hips swayed with each step, but nothing about her was inviting. Her body moved like a threat pretending to be a promise. Like someone imitating seduction from memory.

She leaned in close, her breath hot through the mask, brushing my ear like a secret.

Gloved fingers traced my collarbone, then slid down my chest… slow, deliberate, like she was reading me in braille.

She paused below my waist.

Not in hesitation.

In interest.

Her hand slipped under the gown.

The latex was cold at first, but it warmed as she moved… drawing soft circles, lower and lower.

Like she was studying me.

Claiming me.

All the while, she hummed a lullaby I didn’t know…

But somehow recognized.

Another nurse entered behind her… same uniform, darker stains. She moved like she wanted to be watched. Carried a surgical tray with both hands like it was a gift.

The tools weren’t clean. Not even close.

The scalpel had dried tissue curled around the tip. The clamp was rusted at the hinge, with a strip of tendon stretched across the mouth like jerky. One retractor had a wad of black hair snarled in the teeth. Gauze stuck to the tray beneath it all… stiff with blood, cracked at the folds.

The second nurse raised the tray and tilted her head, like she was showing me her favorite toy.

“You’re prepped,” she said.

“You’ll open so clean,” the first nurse whispered, as she traced a finger across my stomach.

Then I closed my eyes. Just for a second.
 

When I opened them again, the room was empty.

The restraints were undone. Still indented into my skin. No lights. No nurses.

But I wasn’t alone.

I sat up. My gown clung to my back with something warm and sticky. The air was colder than it should’ve been.

I stood.

The hallway outside looked like the same hospital… but peeled open. Linoleum curled off the floor like dried skin. The fluorescent lights buzzed in pulses like a heartbeat. The walls were yellow tile, but rotting, damp, slick.

Room 4 had a patient.

The floor was stained in perfect loops, like someone had bled in spirals. There was an IV bag still hanging, half-full of something black. The line dangled and twitched. A limbless torso lay on the bed, breathing through a rusted trach tube, its eyes fixed on me.

Room 6 was worse.

A woman sat upright in a padded chair. Her face twitched with every stitch. Her jaw was visibly broken… or just never set right. Her eyes wide and unblinking. She was sewing patterns into her own lap using long threads of human tendon. Her hospital gown was hiked around her waist so she could work. I couldn’t see all the designs… just that they were deep. Intentional. And still wet.

She smiled when she saw me.

Her teeth didn’t match.

Room 9 was the worst.

A man, maybe. Braced backward over an exam table, limbs locked in metal restraints. His body was twisted in impossible angles by some cruel brace mechanism, every joint forced in the wrong direction. His mouth hung open, but no sound came out.

A nurse stood behind the glass. One hand resting on her hip, the other slowly rubbing her inner thigh through the fabric. When she noticed me watching, she didn’t stop.

She shifted her stance like she wanted to be seen…

…and when she did, her skirt lifted… just enough to reveal it.

My name, carved into the pale skin of her upper thigh.

Letter by letter.

She traced over them with a gloved finger, never breaking eye contact.




I moved past a nurse’s station. One monitor was still on—showing a room I recognized.

My bedroom.

Me, sleeping.

Then static.




I blinked again and I was in recovery.

White lights. Warm blanket. Apple juice in a plastic cup.

“You scared us,” the nurse said. Her voice was sweet. Too sweet. “You were out a little longer than expected.”

I asked her how long. She just smiled.

Eventually, they said I was free to go. Discharged. A cab dropped me off outside my building like nothing happened. Like it was just a normal procedure.

But things felt wrong immediately.

The apartment looked normal. Same couch. Same coffee stain on the carpet.

But the scar was too long. Curved. Raised in a way that didn’t match the procedure.

The hallway outside my unit smelled like antiseptic and something sweet underneath. Not rot… sterilized rot. The fridge buzzed in a rhythm that was oddly familiar.

Later that night, I woke up to the sound of heels on tile pacing just outside my bedroom.

I got up to check the hallway… walked past the bathroom—and noticed the mirror was fogged.

I hadn’t taken a shower.

I decided to look up St. Emory Medical because I needed answers.

The website was gone.

I found an archived article—local paper. Said the hospital shut down two years ago. Unexplained deaths. Patient files vanished.

An anonymous source claimed some staff were doing things that didn’t follow medical procedures… extra incisions, strange scarring patterns, markings that didn’t show up on any charts.

My surgeon’s name was listed. Dr. Leyra. No trial. No charges. Just “location unknown.”

It’s been days. The apartment’s changing.

The tile behind the fridge has yellowed and cracked. The hallway smells stronger now… like bleach trying to cover something deeper.

The lights hum in a way I’ve only ever heard in one place.

And the door…

I haven’t opened it. Not since that night.

But I hear movement on the other side. Gurneys rolling. Heels on tile. Steel trays clattering like teeth.

I’m posting this now, while I still can. While the modem blinks and the laptop stays cool.

If you’re reading this… check your scar.

If it’s curved.

If it hums.

If you wake up and the walls are wet…

You’re already in it.

You just haven’t noticed yet.
