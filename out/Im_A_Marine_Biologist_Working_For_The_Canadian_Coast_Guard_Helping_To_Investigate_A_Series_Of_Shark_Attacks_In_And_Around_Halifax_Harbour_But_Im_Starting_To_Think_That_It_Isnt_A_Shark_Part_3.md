So, things have been rather hectic through this investigation. We've had a few interesting conversations and gotten a few answers we've had so far in this investigation, but it hasn't lessened the fear and terror of our situation whatsoever. In fact, I'd say these answers have revealed that the situation is worse than we initially thought. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

As I've mentioned before, since the incident with the shark cage the entire Amity crew has been seeing Bruce, occasionally showing his fin above water as if to let us know that he's still following us. What I didn't think to mention while I was typing that however was that, since the incident, Lawrence had surprisingly been rather quiet the past three days. Usually, even in serious situations and cases that he's stuck his nose in, the representative would always find a way to directly question my skills in the trade or spout some words about how my marriage is blasphemy or something along those lines. This time however, he had barely said a word to anyone on board and had been keeping to himself, almost always standing near the port and staring out at the water with a pale look on his face. It eventually got to the point where Dylan pulled out a bag of dice and passed out a pair of 6 sided dice to each of the twelve of us.

"Alright, I don't know about you folks but I'm getting worried about Larry," the older gentleman declared as he passed them out, "Instead of fighting among ourselves on who's gonna check on him, I reckon that we roll dice to decide who does. Highest roll will be the one to do it."

We each took turns rolling out our dice to see who would go talk to Lawrence. I was the only one who got an 11, causing me to mutter "Well fuck."

"Jamie, you're up,"  my Boss said with a pat on my shoulder, to which I stood up and began walking towards the port.

Lawrence acknowledged me as I reached him but remained silent for a while. Even now he was still staring out at the water, watching as Bruce's fin surfaced again. I stood there with him, unsure of what to say to him, and found myself watching Bruce along with him. It's then that I noticed something odd about the beast in question. Before I could only see it in bad weather and in deep water so I wasn't able to get a close look, but with the sky clear and the sun out I could make out what appeared to be burn scars on its fin and what I could see of its scales. They looked pretty bad, and rather old, as if Bruce had had them for years.

"You see them too, right?" Lawrence suddenly said, nearly startling me, and when I turned my attention to him he continued, "Those burn scars on its hide, I mean."

"Yeah, I do. Any guesses as to what might've caused them?" I asked rhetorically, not expecting an answer but was surprised to receive one.

"Oil, most likely," the representative replied solemnly, glancing over at me, "Seems like our 'friend' here found themselves caught up in an oil spill that likely involved plenty of fire. Unfortunately, I think I know which one."

"Oh?"

He was silent for a moment before he said, "Do you know why I've been acting the way I have? Force of habit unfortunately, one that I've actually been trying to break for years. You already know that I'm Catholic, but the truth is a lot more complicated than that. I didn't grow up here in Canada like you guys did, rather I was raised in a suburban area just on the outskirts of New Orleans in a very...extreme Evangelical sect. In fact I guess it should rather be referred to as a cult. I was pretty deep and brainwashed in it too, and trust me when I say I've said and done worse shit then everything I've said to you two combined, and I fucking hate it."

"Well, not something I expected to hear but alright,"  I said, comprehending what I've just been told and trying to figure out how to approach such information, "So...what changed?"

"I got a job outside of the neighbourhood back in March 2010," Lawrence replied, his eyes glazing over as if he was lost in memories, "I was a safety inspector for an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. My job on paper was to ensure that everything was secure and functional, but the cult had some influence on the rig, so I was occasionally paid extra to look the other way. I didn't care at the time since I was still under their thumb, but...well, I'm sure you can figure out exactly what happened one month later."

At first I wasn't sure what he was referring to, but it wasn't long before the details he gave clicked together and I said, "The oil rig you were on, it was the Deepwater Horizon wasn't it?"

"...Yeah, it was," he said as he pulled up his right sleeve, revealing a pattern of burn scars along his arm, "One minute, I was patrolling around to look for leaks. The next thing I knew, I was in the water, surrounded by burning oil. These scars will constantly remind me of why I can never go back to slacking off on my duties. What happened next was a blur, but I vaguely remember being rescued by someone or something and that they were seriously burned by the flames."

He turned towards me again and coldly said, "I've been trying to deny the existence of the supernatural for 14 years because I didn't want to accept the harm my negligence caused to the entity that saved me that day. But your very existence and the incident three days ago, not to mention Bruce being right in front of us has thrown that truth right back in my face. You wanna know why I've been silent? Because I've *seen* Bruce before, and I recognize those scars. Bruce is the thing that saved me, and all they got was horrible injuries and not even a thank you in turn. I..I don't know about you Jamie, but if I got injured saving someone and they didn't even come looking for me to thank me...I'd probably hate humanity too. It's likely my fault that this happened."

"Larry, you shouldn't blame yourself for a disaster like that," I cut in, alarmed that not only would he do such a thing, but that our Man Eater could be tied to a tragedy like the Deepwater Horizon, "You grew up under the influence of a cult, no one should be blaming someone for being influenced to not do their job by a group that's had them under their thumb for their whole life. Speaking of, what happened with the cult after the disaster?"

"Oh, those rats?" the representative scoffed in annoyance, "My parents only visited me once in the hospital with our leader once during my whole stay. They made it seemed like they cared for my well-being and that they were just giving me enough cash to pay for my bills and then some, but I'd been with them long enough to understand that they were really trying to buy my silence on the negligence onboard the rig. This opened my eyes and made me realise that the leader really didn't care about anyone within his church, to him we were nothing more than puppets. So, I took the money and later left an anonymous tip that helped expose the safety conditions on the rig. As for the cult themselves, their leader vanished into the night after the rest of the cult was arrested for something unrelated."

It took some more talking and coaxing, but eventually I was able to convince Lawrence to come back to where everyone else was. Soon we were planning what to do next, and eventually Matt would make a suggestion that, while simple, would not only change how I had thought of the bespectacled man, but would end up revealing just how serious this investigation actually was.

"I should see if my fiancee can come help out with identifying what we're dealing with," the news reporter declared, "I have my suspicions, but Tia works in the mythology section of our city's history museum, she'll certainly have a better perspective than me."

"You suspect this is some mythological beast that's stalking us?" Lawrence gruffly inquired, his eyebrows furrowed with interest.

Dylan turned to look at the representative as he replied, "Well, it sure as hell ain't a shark, let alone any marine life I've seen in my time sailing the seas. Hell, Blue Whales can't even reach the size of that thing."

"We can rule out any prehistoric animal, too," Ellen interjected without even looking up from her notes, "There's no known Plesiosaurs that look in any way similar to that, and there's no records of a Megalodon looking like that either, let alone reaching anywhere that size."

"Guess we have no choice," I noted calmly, and then turned to Matt and said, "If it helps our investigation, see how fast she can get here."

"Oh don't worry, she'll be here in no time," Matt chuckled as he walked away and pulled out his phone, "Let's just say you're not the only one who's a great swimmer."

His comment was quite confusing at the time, but it was only when Tia inevitably arrived that I understood what he meant. Ten minutes after Matt finished the call, the Amity rocked slightly as if to indicate we were being boarded. Soon after Matt approached us with a beautiful Chinese woman that he introduced as his fiancee Tia. There did seem to bee something off however, as she looked like she had just climbed out of the ocean and there didn't seem to be another boat in sight.

Catching on quickly, right after my introduction I politely inquired, "Ten minutes is honestly pretty quick Miss, how was the swim?"

"Quite lovely, Child Of The Seas," Tia replied with a gleam in her eyes with a voice that seemed familiar to me, "The weather is pretty nice at the moment, though it's going to be difficult with that hurricane on the horizon."

"That should be impossible, we're several kilometers away from Halifax," Lawrence pointed out with confusion, before his eyes suddenly widened in recognition as he continued, "Wait a second, you're not human either, aren't you?"

The mythology expert chuckled, her eyes flashing ocean green with serpentine pupils as she replied, "For a skeptic, you sure catch on quickly."

Ellen interjected with a polite question of her own, "So, what are you then?"

"Same as what our 'friend' following your ship is," Tia declared while pointing at the water where Bruce's fin had once again appeared, "A Sea Dragon."

We were silent for a moment, taking this in. While there were some of us that had already believed in the supernatural (kinda happens when you're sailing through the seas, regardless of the job most sailors are superstitious anyways), but Dragons being real is another thing entirely. Even being a shape-shifter myself the announcement took me by surprise. Growing up I remember reading stories about these majestic, godlike creatures with immense power over nature, but back then I simply thought that they were nothing more than fairy tales and myths. And yet, here were two living pieces of proof right before my eyes, one that had attacked me days before in the water, the other awkwardly waiting for someone to say something. Just then, it occurred to me why Tia's voice was so familiar, but Lawrence spoke up before I could.

"Okay, I don't know what's wilder," the representative managed to get out through his own shock, glaring at Matt, "The fact that Dragons actually exist, or the fact that you've been engaged to one this entire time and didn't bother to, oh I don't know, bring it up at least once?!"

"In my defense, no one asked, and you sure as hell wouldn't have believed it Larry," Matt said calmly with a shrug.

"I thought I recognize your voice," I finally managed to say, holding up the evidence bag with the mysterious scale I had found on the beach, "This is yours, isn't it? It's also why you immediately called me Child Of The Seas, right?"

Tia was silent for a moment, just staring at the scale before saying, "Yes, indeed it is. The young man you likely found that with had accidentally ripped it out of my hide while I was trying to defend him from Bruce. Sadly, he didn't make it."

"Does that mean you might know why he's attacking people?" Dylan inquired, to which the Dragon nodded.

"Yes, and I honestly wish that my fiance or any of you were caught up in this, but it's too late for that," Tia said as she turned towards us with a look of worry, "This is more than just a series of attacks on humans, a rather nasty situation is starting to erupt among the Dragons, and all of humanity is starting to get caught in the cross hairs."

"So, what's going on then?" Ellen asked, with everyone practically shifting in their seats.

Taking some time to ponder how she had to say what we were about to learn, Tia next words rocked us to the core, the knowledge of which still scares me while typing this:

"For a long time, longer than I've even been alive at least, Dragons have had a finicky relationship with humanity. We've had bad eggs on both sides, each causing some form of harm. Sometimes with a motive, sometimes with little rhyme or reason. On one hand there have been cases of Dragons terrorizing human towns, forcing the citizens to hand over all of their valuables in exchange for protection. On the other hand, some humans will take incidents like that as justification to harass Dragons that haven't done anything wrong and, like you, are simply trying to live their own lives. Over the years it slowly started to get worse and tension began building as the environment began to take damage due to pollution. It also doesn't help that the Dragon Queen, who governs over all different Dragon kinds, consistently has been turning a blind eye at everyone's plights, whether it be her being payed off or simply not caring for anyone other than herself. Rumours of younger Dragons plotting a revolt have been simmering for a long time. I can't confirm anything like that, but I think its safe to say that our friend Bruce here likely has a lot of hatred towards humans and is lashing out."

"So, that's our situation?" I inquired cautiously, dreading the answer, "That's why he's attacking innocent people."

Pointing out at the beast nearby, Tia solemnly replied, "See his scars? Whatever caused them was more than likely man-made. There's likely also damage to his gills as well, otherwise he wouldn't be surfacing as often as he clearly has been. Sea Dragons like myself usually prefer to eat marine wildlife like fish and whales, so having to surface that much means he isn't able to reach the depths where his normal prey is, let alone stay there long enough to eat. It's much like when a big cat becomes a Man Eater, usually it's because the animal is injured or sick and thus can't catch their normal food, so they attack humans out of desperation. The only differnce in this case is that there's also the added layer of his hatred."

It was right then that Bruce decided that his presence wasn't noticed enough, for he began moving again, his mere movement causing the Amity to shake from the waves the Sea Dragon made. Yet another crew member fell overboard, this time from the crows nest, only I wish she had landed in the water. Instead, she had the absolute misfortune of landing on the crane's hook, and we had the misfortune of watching the hook impale her through the jaw. Several crew members ran over to her, but before anyone could reach the crewmate, Bruce's head shot up out of the water and snatched her corpse off the hook and dragged her under. This was the closest any of us had gotten to the beast, and his head was quite the sight to behold. It was absolutely massive, shaped much like a horses and covered in aquamarine scales riddled with scars. Each one of his whiskers was as thick as a human arm, and as his head was going back into the water we were able to clearly see his eyes. His ocean green eyes were about the size of dinner plates, and were filled with pure malice and hatred. I don't think I'll be forgetting those eyes anytime soon.

"Shit, he's really not gonna stop until he picks us off one by one, isn't he?" I heard Lawrence shout out in horror as the water began to calm down.

Thinking quickly, my boss ordered the crew to get the Amity moving as soon as possible. The Amity's engine roared to life as we raced away from Bruce, the Sea Dragon hot on our heels. What was likely only a couple hours felt like forever as he chased and attacked us. He managed to catch up twice, and both times we lost yet another crew member as he knocked them off and devoured them, leaving nothing but pieces behind. At one point he even hit the fishing vessel with his tail, which actually brought me way too close to being thrown overboard. I ended up clinging on to the stern for dear life, terrified as once again Bruce's jaws were mere feet away from devouring me. Fortunately, Lawrence happened to be the closest person to where I was and held out his hand while holding on to the railing. Making sure his feet were firmly planted on deck, he just barely managed to pull me up before its jaws clamped down on his forearm.

I heard him cry out in help as Bruce began to start pulling him away, and grabbed a hold in an effort to not lose another person. I knew that we had to act then and there or he was a goner, so I grabbed a nearby knife and passed it to him, to which his eyes widened at the realization.

"You're insane, you know that?" I heard him yell over Bruce's snarling, the beast growling like a dog playing tug of war over a toy.

"Pretty sure you'd rather be alive to keep on redeeming yourself instead of becoming Dragon bait," I yelled back, "Now if you wanna live cut it off already!"

Gritting his teeth while mumbling about Bruce's teeth working as a good enough tourniquet, Lawrence let out a grunt of pain as he proceeded to saw through his arm and fell to the deck. I just managed to pull both of us to safety before Bruce went after the Amity again, but I didn't walk away entirely unscathed due to breaking my foot in the process. This back and forth with Bruce attacking us continued for a good hour more.

Finally, after he chased us several more kilometers away from Canada's Eastern shore, he seemingly decided that he was bored of us, vanishing once more under the waves. Just as we finally got the chance to relax, we soon discovered that our situation had gotten much, much worse.

"Captain, the weather radar's going crazy!" the first mate called out, making sure to clarify as soon as we entered the bridge, "It's the hurricane, coming right for us from the southeast. It looks like it'll be here by evening"

"How big are we talking?" Dylan asked, all of us dreading the answer.

"Category Five, sir," the first mate said with a look of fear in his eyes, a similar look forming in my Boss' eyes.

Almost immediately Dylan began barking down orders to secure the ship. As I stepped outside to take a breather, I could see that the ocean waves that were once calm were slowly starting to pick up in intensity. Looking out to the southeast, I could see enormous black clouds headed in our general direction, the sound of thunder echoing in the distance as the wind began to pick up. Right now I'm trying to get this part of my tale online asap so I can help tie things down, the clouds getting ever closer. I'm absolutely terrified right now. The information we received was bad enough, but now the hurricane is almost on top of us, and with that as well as Bruce still circling I have no idea if anyone's gonna make it out alive. Lawrence and I almost died out there, and while it doesn't seem like Bruce was ferrying us to the storm, he definitely wants us dead one way or another, and we were too focused on getting away from the beast to realize it. I'll make sure to keep everyone here informed as soon as everything is over, provided I'm still around to do so.
