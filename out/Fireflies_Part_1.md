I tap my finger on the clear water, and watch the ripples fan out around the spot.

I do it again.

I lift my long skirt to my knees, and put my legs in.

The dock is high, but my toes can be submerged. I sigh at the heavenly feeling.

“You get started without me?”, a familiar voice says behind me.

My cousin Laura sits down next to me and mimics my movements, dipping her pink toes into the water.

“I wish we had another week..”, I sigh, looking across the lake to the trees lining the edge.

“All good things must come to an end, right?”, Laura asks, smiling sadly.

I shrug my shoulders, and close my eyes, listening to the birds sing.

We sit for an hour, before we hear the bell. The large, brass bell chiming to signal us that our dinner is ready.

“That’s the first thing I’m getting rid of when I inherit the house.”, Laura laughs.

“Hmm.. Not if I inherit it first!”, I respond, squealing and running up the hill to our summer home.

The house is a vast, two-story farmhouse dream. With a wraparound porch, wind chimes my Grandpa got from his travels, and always a warm meal.

Tonight, it was gumbo. My Aunt’s specialty.

As all 7 of us take in the warm, spicy broth, I try to take a mental picture of this moment. Something to keep with me.

“You and Laura have fun at the lake?”, my mom asks me.

“Yeah, just sat and listened to the water.”, I tell her, smiling.

“I’m surprised you could hear the water, with how much you girls chatter.”, our Grandpa says loudly.

The table laughs.

Laura squints at him, but says nothing.

“We were talking about which one of us would get the house one day..”, I say.

“Ohhhh, we are aways away from that, hopefully!”, he chuckles.

The table laughs even harder as my Grandpa pretends to check his heart rate, then giving the table a thumbs up.

I smile at the chaos.

I wish this could be every day.

As I look around at the smiling faces, I see Laura is still staring at our Grandfather.

I try to catch her eye, but she doesn’t look my way at all.

After dishes are cleaned, and everyone is settling in, my dad reminds me of our early flight the next day.

I nod, pouting a little.

“Ahhh, I know. You start school in 2 weeks though, still can’t believe you’re going to college. I keep thinking you aren’t old enough.”, he chuckles, but I see his eyes glass over.

“I know, it’s weird..”, I respond, “But we will always have the lake house. I’m already planning next summer!”

“Me too, sweetie.”, he says, wrapping me into a hug.

I tell him goodnight, and head to mine and Laura’s shared room.

Laura is already in her tank top and sleep shorts, flipping through a journal.

“Are you done in the bathroom? I was going to shower.”, I ask.

She waves me off, still focusing on the small book.

After my shower, she’s still reading it.

“Okay, are you ready?”, I ask her.

“Hmm?”, she responds absentmindedly.

“For our last night tradition…?”, I say slowly.

She’s still not listening.

I reach over and swipe the book from her, which has her whining.

“Oh hello Laura, nice to have you join us.”, I say in my best disappointed voice.

“I will listen if you give it back.”, she says sternly.

I toss the book on her bed.

“Thank you.. So what were you saying?”, she asks, like I’m bothering her.

I roll my eyes.

“The lake? It’s the last night?”, I repeat.

“Ohhhhh, right. Yeah, let’s go.”, she mumbles.

We each grab our bags, flashlights, jars, and a pad of paper. 

Laura sneaks the journal in her bag.

We check the house to make sure it’s quiet, and then we stalk out the back door towards the lake.

“What is that book you have?”, I ask.

Laura says nothing.

I dramatically sigh, and roll my eyes.

When we get to the lake, fireflies are already floating.

“Oh, perfect!”, I giggle.

I sit down on the dock, and bring out the pad of paper.

There’s a few more than usual this year, every year a couple more join us. I like to think they tell their friends to come visit us.

Every year since Laura and I were little, we’ve come out to the lake by ourselves on the last night of our annual trip. We take little pieces of paper, and write our wishes for the next year on them. When we’ve done it, we put the papers in a jar, and then catch a firefly for each wish.

We put the fireflies in the jar, hum until our voices grow as loud as they can, and then we let the fireflies go.

Our grandpa always told us that fireflies were magic, and they could see things others couldn’t.

When we were little, it felt like the fireflies were taking our wishes with them to the sky.

We know better now, but we’ve never missed a year.

I’m writing down my wishes, I have 3 this year, when I look over at Laura.

She’s still reading that stupid book.

“Seriously?”, I ask her, “This is our thing and you aren’t even paying attention.”

“I’m sorry, Sher, I am. I’m distracted and I shouldn’t be.”, Laura says, putting the book back in her bag.

“Are you going to tell me what the book is now?”, I ask impatiently.

She pulls the book back out, and hands it to me.

I flip through the pages, and it’s someone’s handwriting.

“I think it was Grandma’s, I found it in the storage closet when I was looking for extra blankets.”, Laura whispers.

Our Grandma died when we were little, maybe preschool age. I remember her with smells of strawberry muffins and her peppermint perfume.

But I can’t remember anything else.

I make out a couple words on the pages, but it doesn’t seem like anything of interest. Just her daily chores, grocery lists, entries where she talked about her family.

I shrug.

“Well that’s cool that you found that, Grandpa will probably let you keep it if you ask him.”, I say, handing her the book back and picking up my jar.

“No, Sher. I don’t think I can ask him.”, Laura whispers.

I raise an eyebrow.

“Why not?”, I ask.

“Because.. Grandma talks about him..”, she continues whispering.

I snort.

“Well I’m sure she did, just skip over anything that isn’t PG rated.”, I say at a normal volume, laughing.

Laura shushes me, looking at me with concern.

“I don’t mean that, I mean.. I think Grandpa hurt people.”, she whispers, annunciating the last few words.

I laugh loudly.

“Grandpa? Who needs a cane?”, I laugh.

She glares at me.

“If you aren’t going to listen to me, I’m going back.”, she huffs, gathering her things.

“No, wait. I’m sorry. Okay, tell me why you think that.”, I say, putting my hand on her arm.

She eyes me for a moment, and then takes out the journal.

“Read this, here.”, she says, opening the book to a marked page.

I take the book slowly, and sigh before I begin to read.

“July 20th

He has continued acting strangely. Last night, I didn’t drink wine with my dinner like I normally do and I heard him. He snuck out after midnight and didn’t return until the sun was beginning to rise. When I asked him about it, he laughed at me and kissed my hand. Said I imagined it, but I’m not crazy. I don’t know what he’s doing, but I will figure it out.”

I close the book and hand it back to Laura.

“Okay, I don’t think Grandpa sneaking out means he hurt someone. He could have been having an affair, old people do that all the time.”, I say.

Laura is flipping through pages meticulously, when she hands me the book again.

“There, read there.”, she says, pointing.

I look at her with disbelief, before taking the book.

“July 25th

I followed him. I waited until he left, and I followed him. The littles were all asleep still, Laura and Sherrie were cuddled up on the couch with their princess dolls. I kissed them both on the head before I left. 

He went out across the lake, and I thought I lost him in the trees, but I found him eventually. He walked for 3 miles to an old shack, I couldn’t really see inside. But I’m going to come back. The shack was next to a fallen sign marking the trail, if I follow that, I’ll make it to the shack again.

On the way home, a firefly followed me, lighting the way.”

I look up at Laura, her expression pained.

I turn the page.

“July 26th

I went to the shack today. I told everyone I was going to the store, and I’ve never lied to my family. He was going to take the kids out to the creek for swimming, so I took it as my opportunity. 

The shack wasn’t locked, so I opened the door and looked around. As you can imagine, it was dusty as heavens. I looked for a bed, for a way for him to have another woman there, but there was just a table. A small table with one chair, and a small cabinet with various dry snacks. I had laughed to myself, thinking this was his version of a man cave. I was chastising myself for suspecting him, and I was just about to close the door when I heard a scratching sound.

I paused my hand on the door, and looked around the space. Looking for a small animal. The scratching continued as I moved the table away from the wall.

‘Hello? Is anyone there?’, a voice said.

‘Who are you?’, I demanded.

‘Please help me, he has me locked here. My name is Blair. Please. He took my friend from here yesterday, and I don’t know where she is..’, she began to sob.

I tried the handle, but it had a huge lock, where a key was needed.

‘Oh sweetie, I need a key. Okay, just hold tight, and I will come back for you tonight. I promise.’

Blair said nothing, but I heard her crying.

I stumbled up on my feet, feeling like the world was falling apart. She couldn’t be talking about.. No. He wouldn’t hurt anyone.

I’m sure this is a misunderstanding, I’m sure this is someone else’s shack.

I’ll ask him tonight, I’m sure he will want to make sure the girl is safe.”

I’m shaking now, and I turn the page.

It’s blank.

I continue to turn the pages, only welcomed by blankness.

“Where’s the rest of it?”, I ask, feeling my voice wobble.

“That’s it.”, Laura whispers.

I’m silent, as I stare down at the leather front of the book.

“I asked my mom, she said Grandma died on July 27th.”, Laura tells me.

“But, she died of a heart attack.”, I say.

“That’s what they told us..”, Laura responds, staring off into the woods.

“When did you find this?”, I ask her.

“This morning.”, she responds.

“Okay, well I’m sure there’s an explanation. My mom said Grandma was acting really jumpy and weird right before she died, maybe she was imagining things.. Maybe-“

“Are you seriously blaming her? You aren’t even gonna consider that she’s right?”, Laura snaps at me.

I stare at her in silence.

I open my mouth to speak, then close it again.

She scoffs.

“Well, I’m not going to sit here and ponder with you. I’m going to go look.”, Laura says coldly, grabbing her bag as she stands up. She begins walking off the dock.

“Where are you going?”, I ask her.

She holds the journal up over her head without turning around.

“She basically left a map, so I’m going to go see if the shack is there.”, she calls over her shoulder.

“Laura!”, I hiss.

She’s ignoring me.

I look at her, then back at the house.

I bounce on my feet.

“Oh damnit.”, I mumble, picking up my own bag.

And I follow her into the woods.

*
We walk for about an hour, we don’t talk much except for me periodically asking her to turn back.

She ignores me.

She’s getting really good at that.

When we finally stumble on a fallen trail sign, my breath catches.

Laura is looking around, shining her flashlight.

“Laura, I don’t see anything, let’s go home..”, I tell her.

“There.”, she says.

I turn towards her and see the shack.

It’s tiny, and has clearly seen better days.

The wood paneling is chipped, any trace of paint is long gone. The is a window, with curtains drawn, and a single door.

Laura walks up to the door and pushes it open. 

“Are you crazy?”, I whisper.

She rolls her eyes, and steps inside the doorway.

I smell the inside of the house before I see it.

Mold and dust, with a sickly sweet smell.

“Gross.”, Laura mumbles.

The interior is just like how my Grandma described it, only dustier.

“There’s the table.”, Laura says. 

She walks over to it and pulls it away from the wall, revealing a handle.

She reaches for it, and hesitates just as her fingertips touch the cool metal.

“Laura, we can still go..”, I say, putting my hand on her shoulder.

She looks back at me, and grabs the handle. There’s no lock, so it swings open.

It looks like a crawl space.

Laura shines her light inside, sticking her head in. Then the scent hits us. We both cower back, coughing, pulling our shirts over our nose.

“Don’t go in there, Laur.”, I beg.

“I’m not that stupid, okay?”, she hisses.

She shines the light on the floor, and I see it’s stained red.

My breath catches.

Laura is silent as she moves the flashlight around, showing stained walls, and rusted metal chains on the ground.

“This can’t be his..”, I whisper.

I feel a large, warm hand envelop my arm.

“Can’t be who’s?”, a voice asks behind us.

We both jump backwards at the surprise, scrambling to our feet as Laura shines her light at the door.

“Dad?”, I whisper.
