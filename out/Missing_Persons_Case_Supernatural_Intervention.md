Howdy. I am officer M (only M, privacy reasons, could lose my job if I was exposed). I’ve been investigating these three cases for the past few years, and I wanted to see if anyone had any clue how to solve them.



I normally wouldn’t go to places like Reddit for this, but I’m desperate. Everyone else I’ve tried has said that this is some kind of webseries project thing. It isn’t.



I’m gonna show you the transcriptions of three sets of video tapes. The first set is from James Barlowe, the second from Daren Redd, and the third from Nick Robin.



Well, I’d better get on with it.



\[- - -\]



There’s only one tape in this section. It begins with a man in a priest’s uniform (identified as James Barlowe) in the driver’s seat of a car. The person holding the camera is in the passenger’s side.



CAMERAMAN (LATER IDENTIFIED AS NICK ROBIN): “So! What’re we doing, James?”



JAMES: “Oh, uhm, we’re going to a haunted house to perform an exorcism.”



NICK: “Hell yeah we are!”



Nick turns the camera towards his face.



NICK: “Someone tipped us off on a haunted house recently, so we’re gonna go check it out. And James is gonna use his cool priest powers or whatever to get rid of the ghosts! Right James?”



The camera pans to James.



JAMES: “Ah- Yeah.”



The camera turns back to Nick.



NICK: “Now, I’m not gonna be in this one too much, since James is gonna be doing his stuff on his own.”



JAMES: “Wait what?”



The tape cuts off here, and picks back up with James holding the camera. He’s in front of a run-down, abandoned house. He seems nervous, fidgeting with the stole around his neck.



JAMES: “Okay, so, uhm. I am Father Barlowe, and, uhm..I kind of thought Nick was gonna be here. He- He told me he was gonna be here. I dunno. Uhm. Today I’m going to exorcise this ghost. I, uh, don’t know if I’m allowed to do that anymore. But I know how.”



James turns the camera around, and starts to walk into the house. The front door opens into a hallway, which leads to a living room. The camera shakes as James fumbles with his pockets, then brings out a cross. He holds it out in front of him.



JAMES: “Uhm, if there are any ghosts here, show yourself.”



Nothing happens. James mutters something about editing. He waves the cross around dramatically.



JAMES: “Ghost, or demon, or whatever you are, please come and-”



A loud bang comes from somewhere within the house. James seems to flinch. He can be heard heavily breathing as he turns the camera towards the sound.



JAMES: “Uhm..Okay. That’s okay. I’ve got a cross. I’m okay.”



James begins to walk down the hall, where the sound was heard. The camera is shaking, and James is holding out his cross.



JAMES: “Okay, uhm- I think..I think the ghost is in there.”



James points to the doorway at the end of the corridor, then advances towards it. He walks through, and into what appears to be a study. There is a desk and chair in the corner. The chair has a pitch-black figure in it.



JAMES: “Oh god, okay, uhm- Okay. Okay. Uhm. Uh- Demon!”



The figure turns to face James. He holds out his cross with a trembling hand.



JAMES: “Foul creature, begone from this home-”



The figure stands up and begins to walk towards James. The camera is dropped.



JAMES: “Oh God, oh God!”



James can be heard running away.



\[- - -\]



This first tape is very intriguing to me. The figure has not been identified. At least, not as anyone in the town. 



I interviewed both Nick Robin and James Barlowe (they had not gone missing after this video. quite the contrary, in fact. James Barlowe is the one that brought the video to police), and they revealed that most of the content in their videos was fake.



They said that the events of the video were not planned.



\[- - -\]



The camera appears to be moved around a bit, before setting up to show a man in a red hoodie (identified as Daren Redd) sitting in an office chair. It can be assumed that he’s at his desk. He smiles at the camera.



DAREN: “Uh- Hi. This feels weird, haha. I don’t think I should introduce myself? I don’t know. No one but me’s gonna see this anyways. Unless I make, like, a giant scientific discovery. Or break a world record.”



Daren fidgets with the strings of his hoodie, twirling one between his fingers.



DAREN: “So. My sleep schedule sucks. I’ve been trying to fix it for weeks now, it isn’t working. I’ve decided, fuck it, I’m just gonna roll with it. So! I’m gonna try and stay up for 12 days straight.”



Daren grabs the camera, and shows a calendar up on the wall. The month and year are cut off. Two days are circled (Tuesday, then the next Saturday).



DAREN: “I’ve got a calendar here so that I can figure out how long I’ve been up. If I do more physical stuff, maybe I’ll stay up longer! Haha.”



The camera pans back to Daren.



DAREN: “I’ve got my room-mate watching over me. He’s actually in here right now- Say hi, Nick!”



(PRESUMABLY) NICK, IN THE BACKGROUND: “Hey.”



DAREN: “I rested up real good to prepare for this, so I’m hoping that my plan works. So, uh..Yeah. D-Man out.”

  


The next tape starts out with Daren holding the camera up to Nick Robin. 



DAREN: “Niiiiiiiick.”



NICK: “Why are you recording me?”



DAREN: “Nick how long have I been awake?”



NICK: “Since yesterday, I think.”



Daren flips the camera around to face him. He has a large grin on his face.



DAREN: “That’s right, baby! D-Man has been awake for one whole day! Well- Two? One? Since Tuesday. It’s, uh, Wednesday.”



Daren shows the calendar to the camera. Tuesday is crossed off.



DAREN: “So far, nothing weird has happened yet. I’m tired, but I’ve been drinking a ton of Monster.”



The camera pans to a trash can, with several cans of Monster in it.



DAREN: “So! I should be able to stay up as long as I need. World record, here I come!”

  


The third tape begins with Daren dragging a trash bag outside.



DAREN: “Ok so I forgot to record a tape today, and I know that if I don’t do it now I’m gonna forget again. But, uhm, I’ve been up for..Uh..I dunno. Time is a concept, anyways. It’s Thursday now, though!”



Daren heaves the trash bag into a can. He walks back inside, and sighs with relief as he enters.



DAREN: “Whew, I love air conditioning.”



NICK (IN THE BACKGROUND): “Dude- Why don’t you take your hoodie off?”



DAREN: “Ah, y’know.”



NICK: “I really don’t.”



DAREN: “See, you get it!”



Daren chuckles and brings the camera into his room. He sets it down on his desk, and sits down in the office chair. He has bags under his eyes, and his hair looks messier than usual.



DAREN: “So. Recently, I’ve been tired. Like, horridly tired. To the point where even sitting down is a..” Yawn. “Risky move for me. But, working from home is keeping me on my toes. Who knew that writing reports could be so exhilerating!”



He looks over his shoulder for a moment, before turning back to the camera. His eyes appear wide and frightened, but he’s still smiling.



DAREN: “Uh, pro tip, maybe don’t try this stuff! I’m stupid enough to try and get a world record, but you, uh, shouldn’t be. Anyways, uhm, D-Man out.”

  


The fourth tape shows Daren in the hospital, sitting next to Nick, who is in a bed with an IV in his arm. Daren’s eye bags have gotten worse. 



DAREN: “Hey, uhm. I don’t know if I’m supposed to record in here. I had to drive Nick to the hospital- He had a dairy allergy thing.”



NICK: “I said he could record in here, don’t worry.”



DAREN: “Yea, he- He said I could record this. I think I’m gonna stay the night here- People do that at hospitals, right? But, uh, they don’t need a bed for me. Because I’m not sleeping! I’m just gonna, uh, play on my phone for the night.”



Daren looks over his shoulder, before turning back to the camera.



DAREN: “Well! It’s Friday now. Been, uh, four days, I think? Yeah. I’ve been awake for four whole days! Well, uhm, this is more filler than anything. Nothing to note. D-Man out.”

  


The fifth tape is corrupted. Nothing is salvageable.

  


The sixth tape begins with Daren sitting at his desk. He looks tired beyond comprehension. His knee is bouncing, and he’s tapping his fingers on the table.



DAREN: “Uh, day..Six. I think. It’s Sunday now. The Lord’s day, ha-ha! I’m- I’m not religious. But, uhm, I know one of Nick’s friends is. James something. Maybe I should call that guy. I-”



Daren cuts himself off by looking over his shoulder. He looks back. His eyes are wild and terrified.



DAREN: “I think this was a bad idea. A horrible idea. I- I tried to sleep yesterday. But I couldn’t. I can’t- I can’t close my eyes for too long. Uhm..Nick has been in the hospital since Friday. He’s- He should be back by now. His visits never take this long.”



Daren chuckles. His voice sounds nervous.



DAREN: “He should be back soon, though, right? Right. He’s just taking a bit longer than usual. Uhm, Darry out.”

  


The seventh tape shows Daren sitting under his desk. He sets up the camera and brings his knees to his chest.



DAREN: “Nick came back today. He, uhm. He’s acting different. I was- I was talking to him, and he, uhm. He forgot he had a dairy allergy. He just..Forgot. I reminded him and he went- He went, oh, yeah. Like he didn’t go to the hospital for it a couple days ago.”



Daren appears to be trembling. He pulls his hood over his head.



DAREN: “..Been awake for seven days, ha-ha. So close! Just, uhm..Five? Four? Something around that. That many days left. I don’t- I don’t wanna do this. But I think I have to. I think it’ll leave me alone if I..”



Daren looks up at something offscreen, and screams.



\[- - -\]



Daren Redd went missing after this video. I’ve been looking for him for years. I’m trying to stay professional here, but I really don’t know what’s going on. I still sometimes try to figure out what he was looking at in the last tape. But there’s no reflection in his eyes- No shadows anywhere. Nothing. Could he be hallucinating?



I don’t think he is. I think he’s seeing things, sure, but they’re real. They have to be real.



\[- - -\]



This last section begins with Nick Robin in a car. He’s driving this time, with the camera on the dashboard. James is in the passenger seat. There’s camping gear and a few bags in the back seats.



NICK: “Hey! Welcome back to the PDC (later identified as Paranormal Discovery Channel, the youtube account that both Nick Robin and James Barlowe share), today we’re gonna be exploring a whole abandoned town! It’s called, uh..What was it called again?”



JAMES: “Sasbol heights.”



NICK: “Right, right. Sasbol heights or whatever. Anyways! It’s gonna be cool. Oh- There it is! Dude dude dude- Look!”



The camera points to a charred-looking town. Maybe burnt down?



NICK: “We’re gonna get settled, then get back to all of you. I’ll see y’all soon!”

  


The next tape begins with Nick sitting in a tent.



NICK: “So! It’s been, like, a day. The first night was pretty underwhelming- Just some creepy old town with bugs and stuff. Nothing too special. Just a bigger version of a haunted house.”



Nick looks off screen- Presumably at James. Nick chuckles.



NICK: “James is sleeping right now. Apparently he’s been having nightmares? That’s, uh, pretty normal for him, though. Oh! Today I started setting up the ghost hunting stuff. Unpacking, putting up cameras, all that jazz.”



There’s shuffling from behind the camera. Nick smiles at (assumedly) James, and winks at the camera.

  


The third tape starts with Nick and James going into one of the abandoned houses. Nick seems much more enthusiastic than James.



JAMES: “We’re gonna put a voice-over on this, right?”



NICK: “Yea, yea. Something something, abandoned house, something something.”



JAMES: “Good, good, uhm..Nick, man, you know I like doing this and all..But I don’t think I like this episode. It’s like- It feels wrong, y’know?”



NICK: “Mm..You’re right, you’re right. But hey! Think of the money we’ll get from this. Our reactions are gonna be authentic and shit. Plus, we’ve only got a day left.”



Nick pats James’ back, and James smiles.



JAMES: “Right. You’re right.”

  


The fourth tape is corrupted.

  


The fifth tape doesn’t include James or Nick’s face, but we can assume who is talking. 



NICK: “Listen, man, it- It just got corrupted. It’s fine, right? It’s cool. We can redo it-”



JAMES: “I’m fucking serious, Nick! This isn’t normal! None of the shit we saw yesterday was planned!”



NICK: “I know, I know, but come on man! I need this money!”



JAMES: “Money isn’t worth it, at this point. Please, God, let’s just leave.”



NICK: “If you wanna leave, just go! I can do the video without you.”



JAMES: “I’m not just leaving you with these demons!”



Both Nick and James are quiet for a while. Nick silently walks back to the tent, bringing the camera with him.

  


The sixth tape is shot from within Nick’s car. Nick is driving, the camera is on the dashboard. He seems terrified.



NICK: “I’m not publishing this. I’m keeping this for myself, and- I don’t know! The police, probably! Jesus Christ- I’m fucking speeding. Are there even road laws here?”



Nick looks at his gas tank, seeing the needle nearing the E. He begins to tear up.



NICK: “Fuck- Uhm. What happened. James tried to kill me, and- And I don’t think he’s James anymore. I really don’t. He’s- He’s not that guy I went to high school with. There’s actually no way.”



He looks at the camera briefly, doing a quick double take.



NICK: “What- No. No. No- Goddammit! Leave me alone!” 



The car swerves, and the camera topples over. 



\[- - -\]



I’ve been thinking about these cases since I found them. The actual police department doesn’t know about them- And I haven’t told my superior about them. These tapes just kind of appeared at my doorstep one day, along with a camera.



I looked at the camera’s film, and found three images.



The first one is a picture from the first set of tapes. It seems edited, though. James has a halo.



The second one is from the second set. It shows an image of Daren, with some kind of pitch-black figure behind him.



The third one is, supposedly, from the third set. Though nothing like it is seen anywhere in the tapes. It’s an image taken from the driver’s seat of Nick’s car, showing the camera from the video on the dashboard. On the screen of the camera is Nick. The image is edited to show a car tire over Nick’s face.
