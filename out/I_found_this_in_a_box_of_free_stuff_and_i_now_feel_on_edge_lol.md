I don't have a wild backstory for this. I was walking home from work when I saw a cardboard box on the curb labeled "FREE." Curiosity got the better of me, and I rummaged through it. Mostly junk old books, mismatched kitchenware, a few VHS tapes. But as I was about to leave, a folded piece of paper slipped out from between two books and fluttered to the ground.

It was a blank sheet, except for a single line typed at the top:

 “There were giants in the earth in those days… and also after that.”-Genesis 6:4



Beneath that, in a different font, was a block of text. It read like a manifesto. Here's what it said:

Before the flood. Before kings and pharaohs. Before Olympus, Babylon, and Atlantis. There was a descent. Not of meteors. Not of men. But of angels.

They were not invaders. They came as teachers. As givers of wisdom. As bearers of false light. They were the Watchers divine sentinels who abandoned their posts.

But they did not watch. They lusted. And they fell.

Taking wives from among the daughters of men, they corrupted the bloodline of creation. Their offspring were giants Nephilim beings of immense stature, unnatural strength, and insatiable appetite. Titans who ruled the ancient world before history dared record their names.

And still, the corruption spread. The Nephilim mated again this time with beasts, with birds, with sea creatures. And from these unions came monstrosities that became the foundation of myth:

Horned gods demanding sacrifice. Serpent kings who slithered through temples. Mermaids who sang sailors to watery graves. Chimeras half man, half beast worshiped in blood and fear. Anubis. Baal. Dagon. Enki. Quetzalcoatl. Zeus. Not gods. Not legends. But the genetic abominations of a fallen realm.

All religions birthed from this deception. Every pantheon a repackaging of the same lie fallen angels posing as gods. Demigods as nothing more than hybrid rulers. Their temples rose like parasites, infecting the world with sorcery, pride, and false worship.

Their bloodlines the Nephilim's seed were never wiped out. They survived. They adapted. They now wear crowns, run banks, control governments. The elite descendants of darkness, still ruled by the same ancient rebellion. Still answering to Lucifer, the adversary, the dragon of old.

Modern minds call them something else. Aliens. Star people. Ancient astronauts.

But these are only masks. Deceptions. Cosmic propaganda.

I've seen their toys technology buried in the desert, reverse engineered by men in suits. I've traced their influence through time, finding echoes of the Watchers in every myth, every regime, every throne.

They are not visitors. They are prisoners. Bound to the earth but preparing one final act.

And now, the end draws near.

They will fake salvation. A false second coming broadcast to the world. A holographic messiah descending through the clouds. An alien savior promising peace. It's their crowning deception.

The world will rejoice. The world will unite. And the world will kneel to a lie.

But this is not fantasy. It is scripture. It is prophecy. It is real.

They came from the stars but they fell from Heaven."


If anyone has any idea what this could mean, please tell me. Oh and also there was no date signature nothing, no info so yeah
