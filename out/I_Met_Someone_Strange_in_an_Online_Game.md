It was a typical Wednesday evening after school when I logged onto my favorite server. I had made plans with my friend Richard at school to come online and show him my Minecraft world. I logged on at 6:32 p.m. right after dinner. Within moments, Richard came on. His skin was rather simple -all white with black eyes- and his profile name was Desm0nd. I didn't think much of it when I typed in the chat "let me show you to my place".

Richard followed without saying a word. He watched from a distance as I took him on a tour of a small, three-story, stone castle. Always he hung behind him, never looking at the features that I showed him, but always staring directly at me. No matter what I typed him, he didn't respond, and I eventually got bored of his company and logged off for the night after saying goodbye.

The next day at school, Richard apologized for not coming online last night. I looked at him blankly. "But you were on when I was". He was adamant that he wasn't, and I wondered who then it could've been that I had played with for those three hours. I had bought the server domain from a user online who wasn't using it anymore and was assured that only me and my friends could access it.

I was back online that evening. I searched the woods near my base for Desm0nd. After an hour I stumbled onto a little wooden shack. It was a simple make, like what I would've made when I was 12. And just as I had finished looking around, I noticed the white face and black eyes of Desm0nd staring at me from atop one of the nearby trees. "Who are you?" I texted in the chat, but the figure did not respond, nor did it move. He just stood motionless, as if AFK, his head bent perfectly at an angle so that it felt as though he was looking directly into my eyes from through the monitor.

I logged off for the night, shaken. The next morning, in class, I reached out to the Reddit user that I had bought the server from: "Hey, Are you sure no one still has access to the server. You promised no one else could, but there's another player in my world who I did not invite".

By the afternoon, I got a reply. "Trust me. No one uses that server anymore."

"How do you know?" I texted beneath the table as my teacher spoke on about trigonometry.

"It was my friend's server. But ever since he passed away last summer, none of us have felt like playing. It's too painful, you know? We're always just reminded of him when we go on."

"What was his name?" It was an odd question, but somehow it felt right. All those times that I had seen the player I had checked to see if anyone was online in the log, but no one ever was.

"Desmond" the reddit user responded.

I haven't played on the server since. Or Minecraft at all really. Any time I start a new world, I always think I see a flash of something pale and white in my peripheries, and I imagine the black slit eyes of Desm0nd watching me from behind the trees.
