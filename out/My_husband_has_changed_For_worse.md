There is something terribly wrong with my husband. Léon, his name is and my sweetheart since we were 16, one could say he is my first love and I am his. From the moment we saw each other, we knew we were destiny of one another. It was pure love at first time. I had felt all the butterflies in the stomach, ecstatic in all days and grinning from ear to ear I am sure my parents thought I was going crazy until they find out about Léon and they weren't surprised anymore. As if all the dots connected making the perfect sense that their daughter was in love so they asked to meet him, know what kind of boy bewitched their daughter to the point she can't spend a day without curving the corners of her lips and eyes out of her phone. At their first meeting, I laughed, thoroughly amused by the sight of my usual confident lover fidgeting and gulping air while constantly wiping his sweaty palms. He was very nervous, but he had a task to complete which is to make my parents adore him as I do so when my parents finally come face to face, he gradually transform into the perfection I knew him, fluttering my mom at each dish, sneaking compliments and listening to my father's non-useable advices attentively as if that was a mantra of every success, stroking his ego. They fell in love too just as I did. His mission completed and I couldn't had been more proud and happy because that meant we could stay together as long as we want which we decide would be for the rest of our lives. That was when I was 16. 

Now at age of 28 I...I don't know. I feel like whenever our eyes meet my heart gets constraint, whenever any words leave his mouth is harsh now. The color of his ocean blue eyes has deepen to frustration and the frown on his face just never seem to leave. He has been distant despite us sleeping at the same bed each night, he felt out of grasp and the bed larger than ever. Night was something I once found solace is now something I dread because of how lonely it feels. No more butterflies, no more sweet kisses when he arrive home, nothing. It felt like living with a stranger under the same roof. 

So I decided to take the matters in my own hands because I can't any more wait for destiny to change the course of our loveless relationship, it's time where we have to do something that will either wreak us further or mend us beautifully I hope it's the latter because I love him very much, so so much that it hurts my heart to think of the option of ever leaving him. He was the only man that reside in my heart from as long as I can remember. I don't know if I lost him, will I ever learn to love another when he took my heart along with him. So, at Valentine's day when he was at work, I took a day off from my work from home job which is to take customer's cake orders for their special day so why not I use this skill of mine to make my day special ? Ha, the warmth of my chest is growing again because I still remember I was not one for cakes, heck— I don't even like sweets but when I heard that Léon has sweet tooth I begin learning and in process I fell in love with both and now that two things has become part of my life. One is my living and another is my life. How strange isn't it to love another so much so that you are willing to do anything ? 

And voila ! Completed, the velvet red garnishing at such a beautiful red day is befitting. My lover deserves no less than the best— the noise of the bell ring fasten my pluse, he has arrived ! Oh, gosh. I can't wait to see his beaming face with flourishing happiness in his eyes once again like it did at our collage days when everything was still normal. Still happy. 

Hush ! Not anymore, I can't afford to be pulled into my depths of depression thoughts again. So I quickly went to open the door, his eyes found my and widen a little, must be from the gorgeous floral dress I choose with pink large bow on my waist. "You look ravenous". The laugh fell from my lips, a habit he caught after he begin working is mispronouncing words when he is most nervous. 

"You mean ravishing". I tilt my head, lips curving and he suck his breath nodding. "Yes that". His tongue dart out to soak his dry lips and I tiptoed and peck on his lips, a little brush after months of not doing it. I could sense the tense of his muscle and his eyes rounded, his doe eyes are my favorite. "So, Mister shall we go inside or wanna spend the entire night outside ?" He hurriedly come inside, our skins brushing and a chill caress my spine, the good one. I am sure he felt that too because his lips can lie, face can be masked but his ears, they never fail to stop blushing and now it's nice cherry red. 

He was about to enter the bathroom to fresh up but I stopped him, the surprise first, I can't wait any longer. "Ta-da !" I show him the cake and the romantic mood felt like it vanish, his face fell and every hint of growing warmth that colored his face paled now. 

"Tell me you are joking ?" His eyes flicker to mine and here, the suffocating clawing nails are back, scratching my stomach. 

"W-Why ?" I stutter, a gleam swim across his eyes before sucking more air and attempt to smile, it is a mockery of one. His lips tried to resemble but couldn't. "Why ? What happen ?" Really ? What happen ? Did he not love the red velvet decoration and little petals I made for hours or the vanilla white hue ? What went wrong ? My eyes are darting from his face to my proudest creation and I couldn't see the problem.

"Darling. What in your mind did you thought when making this ?" The claws sank my heart to the stomach. No matter how soften he made the edges of his voice, the disgust coat underneath couldn't be hidden. He was disgusted and I feel myself crying at such a wholesome day. 

Maybe I already begin to because tinkle of cool roll down my cheeks and his lips grasp a little before hugging me, very carefully avoiding the cake as if he hated touching it. "It's alright. I am not angry". Of course he isn't but I feel like that could be better than this one. Where he refuse to tell me the problem and my coward self afraid to ask. The night was over then, he took the cake from my hand,  command me to go bed after changing clothes and I nod, sniffing but not before from the tail of my eyes I saw how he didn't hesitant to throw the cake on the trash. In the bed he again didn't dare touch me and in middle of the night even empty the bed beside me thinking I am deep in slumper but alas, not a little bit of sleep sweep into my body. Sun glowed the earth and black bags heavy under my eyes because I didn't slept at all. The time when I finally feel to drag my feet in the living room, he was gone, his work suit missing. I broke down crying again because no matter how late he got, he never once forgets to tell me he is going to work, this time he didn't left a note too.

Coming with the terms that we are now strangers was difficult to come when we had never thought this stage come, or perhaps I was the one to live in dreams. Not anymore, now that I am living in reality, I realize how scary it can be because I begin noticing his newfound habit of leaving the bedroom at midnight and smoking at balcony. I didn't know he smoked, he was never one to, drinker ? Yes, smoker ? Never. What stressed him so much scared me because in back of my mind, the voices were saying it has to be me. 

"Is this food ! You fucking bitch". He is changing, the silent frown has turn into snarl and quiet groans into loud grunts and his it's okays into curses and degradation. 

"Can't you do one job ?" 

"Can't you at least for god's sake get up from that bed ?" 

And more like that, he isn't the same anymore. He shows his anger at anything small like why isn't the remote of TV isn't working for two seconds or if the food is late to be served and everything is now shifting into a nightmare. But, jokes on me because what I thought is nightmare now then what is about to happen was straight hell then.

Sleep has rarely come to me these days so when today finally came I couldn't be more happier until I wake up, my eyelids felt heavy and when I open, the darkness was like a veil in front of the cause that awake me until the veil was lifted and I screamed my lungs out as my husband, swing the sharp knife at me with a animalistic bloodlust in his eyes I never once saw. Thankfully I rolled to the otherside in time that the gut wrenching noise of blade plunged into the bed churn my stomach. As if my palm had a mind of it's own I grab the lamp light near our bedside and struck him on the head. "You ungrateful bitch ! What is wrong with you !" Wrong with me ? When he is holding the knife at night, standing at the foot of my bed ? What is wrong with him ? That's is the right question but fear didn't let me as I run past him, to the living room and outside of the house I never thought away from my lover like one of those abusive relationship movies and bang my fist against at my nice neighbor's door. A old couple who always brought cookies whenever they made too much, more tears steaming down my face because once a time eating cookies we all sat, sharing our goofy stories and the couple blessed us to forever stay in love like them. That time I was sure we would be that, gray hair, wrinkled face smiling at one another before death come to greet us. What happen to us ? Really ? What happen ? When the door opened, yellow light like gate of heaven shine on me, I was already in my knees, stuttering incoherent. 

Red and blue lights mingle together in my neighborhood often called by others, never did I thought it will be me in the future. Wrapped a warm shawl around me, talking with the police, feels the needle like eyes from windows of my neighbors watching and wondering while my husband in metal handcuffs. Soon enough I was drove to the station for a report, my parents were called and they hugged me without asking anything and I sat outside, waiting to go home to my parent's home to stay but imagine my fear, disgust and betrayal tearing my insides of my parents walking outside after bailing my murderer. Yes, as attempt to murder it was, that doesn't change his intention of what he wanted to do with me when I did nothing wrong to him. Goodness, I never even thought to kill him.  

"Why are bailing him ?" I asked, body trembling and throat tight to speak, my parents hugged me but I didn't spare them a look, all I could see is him grinning at me. He...fooled my parents. 

"Let's go darling". My mother said, dragging me to the car but all I feel is a immense anger, injustice and betrayal of everyone. My parents, my husband, the police. That when I reached home, I didn't ate anything rather I took a knife from the kitchen, hiding it under my pillow so when the time comes I will kill them. I have to because now that he fooled my parents, they will try to kill me too. 

I must kill them before they do. 

Moonless night it is, whispers reach my ears from the other side of the room and I tiptoed to listen and it belonged to my parents and him. They are talking about something. I couldn't really hear many things, they were whispering too. 

"You should have fed her the pills". My mother harshly scold. 

"....I couldn't". He answered something but I couldn't understand nor hear very clearly. What pills are they talking ? I knew it.They are all in it together. 

Footsteps coming towards me alert me to go back to bed and I close my eyes, breathing normally and holding the burning tears within and I felt the bed shifted, I can feel it's him. He lean in and kiss my forehead. 

What ? Is he mad ? 

Is he feeling sorry ? Pity ? A last kiss before killing me ? 

Then I heard him. His voice sour with sorrow. "I am sorry, my love. You do not deserve the illness". Few drops of water that doesn't belong to me touch my skin and my heart tremble unable to understand anything. Only it is softening and my plans changing but the sight of his grinning and ruthlessly attacking me and all other horrible things he did harden my heart again. 

Beneath the pillow my hand tighten around the knife. I will kill him. Before to does to me.
