"la la, lu lu lu lu lala. lu lu lu lu"

I looked over my shoulder towards my 3-year-old daughter, playing with crayons.

The tune had been stuck in her head for days. It was a weird poem for kids—don’t know who came up with it—but it gave me chills listening to it. It was spreading everywhere, compilations of videos. Some real, some generated by AI. Some of them pretty disturbing, actually. With no logic to them. No rhyme or reason. But always that same damn tune, looped over and over again.

"Mama, lu lu lu lu la la."

I turned back to see my daughter tugging at my clothes. She had been demanding more and more iPad time lately, wanting to watch the same videos over and over again.

It really was not healthy, but it was an easy way for them to make a lot of money, I guess.

"Mama!" she said, louder this time. She had also been getting angry a lot. Don’t know where she learned it from. I was always careful not to get mad at her.

"Baby, you just watched it a few minutes ago. We'll watch it in the evening now. When Dad comes home, okay?" I said in a soft voice, getting on my knees.

"Lu lu lu lu la la," she said with swirling tears in her eyes.

"Ugh, fine." I grabbed the iPad, looking for the video. The mother in me gave up.

"It's just a video," I said to myself before handing her the iPad.

"Thank you, Mommy," she said with a smile and took the iPad.

"I'm taking it back after a few minutes, okay!" I said, but she was already off to her room, humming the same tune.

I sighed and went to pick up her things. I picked one of the drawings. It was a drawing of me. I could only tell by the word Mommy scribbled on the left corner.

"She likes the colour red, I think," I whispered. Because there was a lot of it.

Max wasn’t coming tonight. Said he’d be staying at the client’s place. That there was a deadline. So I tucked her in early, checked the locks, and went to sleep.

At some point in the night I woke up—no, something woke me up. Something sharp resting on my neck. Before I could react I felt it. Something cutting my skin. Slick, fast. So fast I didn’t feel it at first.

Pain shot up my neck, something warm poured out.

"No..." I snapped up, trying to stop it with my hands. It was... my blood. And it was coming out fast.

My vision started to blur. Feeling the life drain out of my body. In the faint light, I saw my daughter. Holding a knife in hand.

And before I blacked out, I heard it. Quiet. Coming from her room. And she was humming along to it.

"la la, lu lu lu lu la la. lu lu lu lu la la. la—"
