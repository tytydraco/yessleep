Okay, so first things first I work for some sort of a diner.  
I say some sort because its very old fashioned, like 1940s fashion. Anyway,  
Since the building is really old, none of the cooking equipment like stoves and coffee machines wouldn't work with the electrical system the building had, So the owner decided to make everything work using an underground pump system. Basically there are two pumps that make everything work: Pump A and Pump B. Pump A works for the basic equipment like stoves, deep fryers, microwaves, and etc. Pump B is for the dessert types like coffee machines, baking ovens, mixers, and etc, etc. 

As you can tell, having an underground pump system isn't really common for most restaurants since they have a lot of cons.  
One of the main cons is that they oftenly break down which is obviously no good since half of the menu would be "Unavailable" or at some occasions we'd had to close the diner midday and rush everyone out because of the pumps suddenly breaking down.

One day, Both pumps broke down during closing time so the next day, which was supposed to be my day off, I had to come back for the repair which was an absolute bummer.  
Usually there is only 2 workers and one manger during these repairs, mainly because of paperwork and supervision and stuff. Every time this happens usually only one guy comes to fix them, and one of the workers have to guide them and stuff, y'know, so they won't do anything illegal?

Anyways. During this breakdown I was in charge of supervising the repair guy. It was my first time so I was handed over a list of instructions and it was briefly short.

*"Instructions for first time Supervision Guides."*   
 "1) Guide the Repairer down to the Underground Pump System.  
   2) Hand over the *List of instructions for Pump Repairers,* a headset, and a flashlight you can find   
  inside the workbench drawer next to the barrels.  
   3) Go back upstairs and log on the computer in the Communications room. Your headset should   
   already be connected to theirs.  
   4) Use the night-vision cameras connected to the computer and guide the Repairer.  
   5) Make sure they don't get caught.  
   6) Once they're done, meet them downstairs and guide them back up."

I was certainly confused about the rules I was given, especially rule 5.   
I soon realized that the pump system was HUGE! it was so large and dark, the only thing I could see was the damp concrete floor. I understood why I needed to guide the repair guy now. There are no lights under there and to be honest, it kinda creeps me out.

After meeting the repairer I did all the basic things I needed to do:   
Handed over instructions, gave him the headset and the flashlight, and now turning on the computer.  
After putting on the headset, I heard a faint voice.  
*"Uh, hey hello? is this thing working?"*  
"Loud and clear."  
*"Great. This things massive huh? Anyways how are you gonna guide me are there like cameras or something?"*  
"Yeah, Night vision. Anyways turn on the flashlight and move in, I'll tell you when you need to change directions."  
*"Noted. Names' Mac by the way"*  
"Alright Mac. Turn about 6 feet to the left and keep walking forward."  
After staring at the computer screen for a while I leaned forward to switch cameras when I suddenly notice something move at the bottom of the screen.  
"The fuck?"  
*"What? the hell happened?"*  
"Nothing. Thought I saw something."  
*"Well shit man! don't scare me like that."*  
"Turn left and keep walking forward and in about... uh.. lets say 3 minutes you'll be at Pump A."  
I'll admit, this was kind of getting boring so I tried to open youtube on the computer until I heard mac speak again.  
*"Alright man the first pump is on where's the second one at?"*  
"Just a second.. Just keep going right until you see it."  
*"Whys it so dark in here anyways man? why not install some lights.."*  
"Just the style i guess."  
Silence followed by footsteps ended the conversation.

  
After a few minutes of scrolling on my phone I was abruptly startled by yells coming from the headset.  
*"FUCKING SHIT MAN WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!"*  
"Hey calm down now,  what happened?"  
*"SOMETHING JUST GRABBED ME BY THE ARM!"*  
*"SHIT MAN! WHAT THE HELL, ITS GRIP WAS SO FUCKING STRONG I HAVE BRUSIES ON MY ARM!"*  
A series of curses from mac floods the headset, leaving me desperately trying to find him on the cameras.  
*"FUCK YOUR STUPID PUMPS IM OUT OF HERE"*  
"Calm down and tell me what happened."  
Only heavy footsteps and breathing responded me.  
"Mac, are you there? I cant find you on the cams man."  
*"SHIT MAN.. IM FUCKING LOST"*  
Over the headset i could hear mac stopping to catch his breath, but in the background faint footsteps could be heard.  
"Just keep running man im getting my boss"  
To be honest, I didnt really believe him, but I was gonna tell my boss anyways.  
*"DONT FUCKING LEAVE ME HERE MA-"*

A few seconds later, i find my self standing infront of the door to the pump system, silently reading the back of the paper i was given.  


"7) *If the repairer finds them self as bait, assure them help will be on the way.*  
  8) *Unplug the computer and exit the room. Its too late for them now*  
  *9) Tell your supervising manager it was a success, nodding after you say it. They will understand.*  
 *10) If you suddenly see Bruises on your arm, quit your job here immediately. Its to keep yourself safe."*
