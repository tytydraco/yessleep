Hello, I’m Nathan Richards. I live in a small town in Ohio. I just moved to an apartment and have been experiencing very strange and unexplainable things. I thought it was just at home, however it’s followed me to my job. I don’t know what to do.

About a year and a half ago I moved here to Ohio to get away from my abusive dad. While living at the house with him I had experienced some weird things, strange voices, seeing people and them not be there after I blink, but I thought it was just my imagination. After moving to this apartment I realized I was wrong.

When I moved in, our landlord said not to use the attic to store things, as a past tenant had done that and then brought termites into the building and they ate at the infrastructure. It was no problem for me, however I heard what I thought was a cat in the attic and after the landlord left, I decided to investigate. I went up, and found that there was an old box, and the scratching sounds were coming from inside. I brought it down and opened it, only to find the box was mostly empty.

It had a picture of a man in his late twenties, an old zippo lighter, and a necklace. I decide to see if the landlord knew could return it to the tenant, however she told me that the person in the photo had never rented the apartment before. I asked her what I should do with the stuff, and she said as far as she was concerned it was mine now. I decided to hold onto the items and I started wearing the necklace. That was my first mistake. After that everything went to hell.

My first night I woke up to hearing someone rummaging through our drawers in the kitchen, and then starting to come up the stairs, but when I went in the hallway and turned the light on no one was there. I brushed it off as the landlord had said that the place tended to creak, and I thought that it was just the apartment shifting. The apartment also had thin walls and my bedroom was right by the neighbors room, so he might have been going through his drawers and I mistook it as coming from downstairs.

However I realized I was wrong about those theories. The next night I was going to the bathroom, and after walking out I noticed my bedroom door was open, however I had shit it when I left my room. Again I tried to rationalize, but I noticed that my closet door was open too, and I knew that I had not opened it since the first day we moved in. I started panicking wondering who might have broken in, so I went downstairs to see if the front door was open, however it was still locked and shut.

I went back upstairs, and when I got there my clothes were thrown about, and the closet door was shut now. My heart was beating like a damn jackhammer. I had no idea what was going on, so I opened the closet door. No one or nothing was in there. I called my brother to see if he had any explanation, but all I got was static. It was at this point I went hardcore panic. Thankfully I had work in an hour, so I got dressed and left early. When I got to my car I looked at my bedroom window thinking of what had just happened, and I saw what looked like a person standing at my window. 

I left, drove to work, I didn’t want to be there any longer. When I got to work it was a slow night and I was by myself. I work over at Owen’s Corning in Newark driving a spotter truck. When we aren’t working we sit on a dirt lot with all the semi trailers that we move. While sitting I lit a cigarette and when I looked up, I saw someone standing by the fence that keeps people from getting on the lot. We have homeless people all around there so it’s not uncommon to see someone, so I brushed it off. It only worries me when I noticed that the person was walking toward my truck.

A gust of wind had hit, and like it was made out of dust, it just vanished. The person was gone. I got a ring on my phone and I jumped, scared myself shitless. My coworker was calling me which was unusual. I answered and heard a piercing scream and then the call dropped. I started crying because I didn’t know what to do. I still don’t. I am still staying in the apartment, and weird things keep happening. I threw the items back into the box and put it back in the attic, hoping it would stop, but they keep happening. Just the other day while trying to sleep, I could have sworn someone was beside me breathing in my ear. I turned over but no one was there.
