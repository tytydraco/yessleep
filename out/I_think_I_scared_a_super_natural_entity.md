 

This took place around 2010ish. At the time, we’d been living in our house for just about 5 years. I was 17 and my sister was 12.We’d had a dog for 3 of those years. I know dogs like to bark, it’s just what they like to do. But it felt like ours barked way more than other dogs. And when she barked, it wasn’t out a window. It was usually at something in the house. This could go on for upwards of 5 minutes. It was always warning barks and growls. The dog was trying to alert us to some danger, and tell the thing to back off. We found it weird, and tried stopping it. But eventually we just accepted it as one of her quirks. The dog rotated what room she slept in every night. One night my room, next night my sister's room. Our rooms are right next to each other in the hallway. 

One night I woke up in the middle of the night. I’m not sure of the exact time but it was at least past one AM. The dog was losing it in my sister's room and going apeshit. Sister is trying and very much failing to calm the dog down. Now I’m a deep sleeper and the dog was loud enough to wake me up, and wake me up good. At night, my alarm clock is the only source of light in my room and it isn’t much. I’m about to roll over and go back to bed when I think I see something in my closet. For context I sleep with it open most of the time. I make out what I think looks like a tall man. Everything about this “man” is hard to explain but It looked like he had shadows shifting like a storm in his body. If that makes any sense. He’s moving out of my closet and into the hallway towards my sister's room. I freak out at the sight of this thing and immediately think that it's a serial killer going for my sister. Stupid I know, but in my defense, I was in flight or fight mode. The adrenaline in my bloodstream probably explains what I did next as well. 

I charged what I thought was an intruder. The thing saw me and I could make out an expression of fear, shock, and amazement all at once. Then my dumbass tripped over my comforter and I crashed into my door. Door handle was already shit, and my 142 lb ass went crashing into the hall. Parents come out, dad yelling about us waking him up. Sister comes out to see what all the noise is about. Dog sneaks past her and starts growling at the stairs that lead up to the hallway. Its teeth bared and tail down. Thing looks like it's going to pounce on something that isn’t there. I tell my parents I think someone is in the house. Me and my dad check every room. Full sweep of everything. We found nothing, zip, zero, nadda. I told my dad everything that happened. He hurriedly explained it as sleep paralysis. I agreed because I wanted it to be sleep paralysis. I have never had sleep paralysis. 

Despite being pretty shaken up, I still managed to go to sleep. That night I dreamed I was hearing one side of a conversation. Talking about being seen and a veil being broken. Just bits and pieces. Our dog stopped her schizo barking after that. I still don’t know what the fuck happened. I think it was all a dream. But that doesn’t make sense. None of this event does. Whatever happened, I’m just glad it's a decade over at this point.
