“I sure am glad we won’t have to deal with that self-centered prick again,” Jake confessed.

“I don’t think Joey meant to come off like that. You didn’t have to give him such a hard time,” Sidney said.

“I guess you’re right. Something about him just rubbed me the wrong way.”

“Maybe it’s just your jock smooth brain failing to resist the urge to pick on the geek.”

“Matt, if that was true, your life would be a living hell,” he said, ruffling my hair. 

I glared up at him, unamused.

“Okay, how are we going to find this next creeper? What did you say it was again?” Sidney chimed in.

“I think he said it’s a suck-me-off.”

Sidney rolled her eyes.

“Not funny, Jake. It’s a succubus. Basically, it’s a sex demon that drains the life force from men when they, ya know… do the dirty. The character from that story met her on a dating app called Kinnder. Her name is Jessica, and she has the ability to visit people in their dreams.”

“You have to admit it. ‘Suck-me-off’ wasn’t a bad joke for a sex demon. Come on.” 

“It didn’t land, buddy. Take the loss and move on,” Sidney retorted. 

“Whatever. How do we find this thing?”

“I think you and I need to download the app and try to match with her. It’s a knock-off Tinder. There can’t be that many people using it.”

“What do I do? Do they even seduce girls?”

“You’re going to be our secret weapon. But for now, just sit there and look pretty.”

Color flushed into Sidney’s face and my heart dropped as I felt my own cheeks blossoming red.

“I didn’t mean… Well, I did, but… I just… I didn’t…”

Jake placed a hand on my shoulder. 

“Lil’ bro, now it’s *your* turn to take the L and move on.”

I bowed my head in defeat. 

“You’ll get her next time, champ,” Jake whispered, tousling my hair again.

I swatted his hand away.

“Let’s just download this stupid app already. I want to get this over with.”

Jake and I downloaded Kinnder and we got to swiping. 

“Remember, Jake, swipe left on every girl who doesn’t match Jessica’s description. Don’t just look for her name. She could’ve changed it after Jason escaped.”

“Bro, do I have to? There’s so many fine girls on here.”

Sidney crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes at him.

“Yes, you moron. Kill the demon, then you can flirt with all the plastic blondes your heart desires.”

“I do like blondes…”

“You know what? I’ll be taking that. If you’re not going to take this seriously, I’ll do it for you.”

Sidney snatched the phone from his hand and began furiously swiping left. Jake and I shot each other a glance. 

“Fine, have it your way,” he mumbled.

We swiped for about three hours when exhaustion got the best of us. Needless to say, we had no luck finding Jessica, and Sidney had nearly burrowed a hole in Jake’s phone screen with her relentless swiping. 

“Alright, that’s about all I can take for one night. Y’all feel free to keep going, but I’m done for now.”

“I’m with you, bro. I’m beat. Now, give me that,” Jake snarled, tearing his phone from Sidney’s grip.

“Hey, you weren’t even on the app! You were shopping for a new purse. With my debit card information!”

“Oh, yeah, look at the time. We really should be getting to bed. See you boys in the morning,” Sidney said, ushering us out of my own room and slamming the door. 

“See you tomorrow, I guess,” I muttered.

I brushed my teeth and mentally prepared myself for another restless night on the couch. I laid down and spread the blanket over myself, barely grazing the tips of my toes. Great. Another night with cold feet. Despite the sofa’s shortcomings, I was out like a light the moment my head hit the pillow. That night I had the most vivid dream of my entire life.

I awoke on a couch in an unfamiliar home. It looked a bit dingy, but nothing out of the ordinary. All the lights were off except for the one in the hallway. Its faint glow illuminated the room in a dim yellow luminescence. I rose to my feet, static blurring my vision from standing too quickly. My whole body felt weighted like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool. I began to laboriously approach the hall. Each step seemed like it lasted an eternity. With bated breath, I gradually reached my destination. 

“Hey, sweetheart. I had a feeling you’d be stopping by,” a woman giggled from somewhere in the shadows.

I nearly leapt out of my skin, vainly attempting to steady my pulsating heart. The woman stepped into the flickering light, revealing herself. It was Jessica. She was incredibly gorgeous. Long brown hair cascaded down her back like the most elegant wave I’d ever seen. Black lingerie hugged her body, advertising her petite frame in all the right places. She smiled at me, perfect white teeth sending my head into a frenzy. Her sharp green eyes pierced mine, paralyzing me with their beauty. She curled a finger toward herself, lasciviously motioning for me to meet her.

I subconsciously began drifting toward her. The rational part of my brain screamed at me to stop. Pleaded with me to listen to reason. It was a trap. All just a ruse to steal my life force and reduce my body to nothing more than an empty husk. But the louder part of my brain, that infuriatingly senseless lobe, urged me to continue. Ultimately, my sexual libido won out. I floated helplessly toward the enchantress while a war raged silently on in my head. 

I came to a halt directly before her. My lustful impulses overwhelmed me. I gently ran my fingers down her shoulders, resting my hands on her perfect hips. She eyed me salaciously, surveying my body like a viper ready to strike. She slipped her soft hands into mine and pulled me close, whispering into my ear. 

“I know what you want. Follow me and I’ll make all your dreams come true.”

My eyes shimmered with unbridled exhilaration. My heart pounded like a freight train as she began to lead me into a room. My head swam with anxious anticipation… and then I awoke. A deep pit of dread settled in my gut. This was going to be more difficult than I’d thought. 

I wearily leaned up. Again, the couch had done no favors for my aching back. Sunlight beamed through the curtains, partially blinding me in my morning haze. I glanced at my phone. I had a new notification from Kinnder. *You got a match!: Jessica*. My blood turned to ice. I threw the blanket off of me, leaping to my feet. I raced to Jake’s room and nearly kicked the door off its hinges.

“Jake! Jake! Wake up, you lazy oaf.”

He groggily sat up and rubbed his eyes.

“What? You’d better have a good reason for waking m-”

“Check your phone. Do you have anything from the app?”

He leaned over and tapped the screen. Nothing.

“Looks like we only have one shot at this,” I said, handing him my phone.

His eyes grew wide.

“Oh, shit. You really matched with her. How do you actually know it’s her?”

“I had a dream. The same dream as Jason did.”

“Well, congrats, bro. I honestly thought you were leading us on a wild goose chase. What are you going to say?”

“I don’t know. I need something good.”

“What did Jason say? He used a pick-up line, right?”

“Yeah. I just need to find a decent one.”

“I don’t know any off the top of my head. Google should be able to lend a hand, though.”

Jake began searching for cheesy pick up-lines, while I stared at my phone in disbelief. It actually worked. I was half-expecting the app to be a waste of time myself. 

“Got it. This one’s perfect. ‘Are you my appendix? Because I don’t know what you do, but this overwhelming feeling makes me want to take you out,’” Jake grinned smugly. 

“Alright. Here goes nothing.”

I sent his pick-up line and awaited a response. It wasn’t long before I received one. Jessica and I began to hit it off immediately. Talking to her was easy. Too easy. I eventually made plans to meet with her that night at her house. Everything was going without a hitch. 

“There’s no way picking up girls is really this simple. We already made plans to meet up.”

“Bro, she’s a sex demon. It’s not supposed to be hard.”

Sidney wandered into Jake’s room, lazily rubbing her eyes.

“Good morning. Any luck with the succubus?”

“Actually, yes. We’re meeting up tonight at six.”

Sidney’s face dropped slightly.

“Are you going to have… you know… sex with her?” she murmured sheepishly.

“No, it’s okay, I’m not going to do anything with her. The plan is to let her think she’s seducing me, while you two sneak in after me and ambush her. Sound good?”

“I guess. But if she lays a finger on you, I swear I’ll fuck her up so bad that she’ll wish she never crawled out of Hell in the first place.”

Jake and I glanced at each other wide eyed.

“Uh, thanks? I’ll be fine, though, I promise.”

“You’d better be.”

We spent the remainder of the day lounging around the house until the evening rolled around. Sidney was in noticeably poor spirits, while Jake cracked jokes, all the while attempting to lift her mood. It wasn’t working.

We pulled up to a small home in a seedy part of town around ten minutes before six. The grass looked like it hadn’t been cut in months, weeds choking out most of the visible vegetation. I noted that a couple of windows were cracked, and one was missing a pane altogether. Decrepit shudders clung to the walls for dear life, ready to come crashing down at a moment’s notice. A sense of uneasy apprehension engulfed me. I texted Jessica and let her know that I’d arrived. She responded immediately, urging me to let myself in.

“Alright, guys, is everyone clear on what to do?”

Jake nodded.

“I don’t know, Matt. I don’t like this,” Sidney said, eyes darting to and fro like ping pong balls.

I slid my hand into hers.

“Sid, it’s going to be okay. Trust me. I’m just going to distract her, and you two will be right behind me.”

“You promise?” 

A single tear rolled down her cheek. I gently wiped it away.

“Yes, I promise.”

She sniffled and wiped her eyes with her sleeve.

“Okay. I believe you.”

I hopped out of the car and crept toward the house. Leaving Sidney behind like that felt wrong, but I knew that I had to push forward with the plan. I tentatively turned the knob and pushed the door ajar. I flashed my friends a quick thumbs up before disappearing inside.

The house was exactly as it was in my dream. A grungy off-white sofa occupied the dark living room. A dirty brown splotch marred the otherwise spotless carpet. A dim flickering light in the hallway was the only thing illuminating the house, casting dancing shadows across every surface. I timidly called out into the darkness.

“Uh, I’m here. Hello?”

“Right here, baby.”

Jessica stepped into the light, revealing the most beautiful goddess I’d ever laid eyes on. She was a mirror image of the woman I’d seen the night before. Long brown hair flowed down her back, tapering off close to her waist. Her skimpy outfit proudly advertised her goods. My eyes drifted to hers, those radiant green spheres casting a spell over me. She smiled, showcasing her flawless white teeth. My heart began thumping like a jack rabbit. She bit her lip promiscuously. 

“Come here.”

I did as I was told, physically unable to resist. I met her in the dank hallway, rooted to the spot directly in front of her. I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. This couldn’t be real. Jessica was absolutely glowing. Her porcelain skin was radiating, enticing me to touch it. I wanted nothing more than to hold her. To run my hands along her perfect frame. But a little voice in the back of my head was screaming at me. Shaming me for even thinking of betraying my promise to Sidney. Jessica placed a finger on my chest, tracing soft circles into it while eyeing me deviously. 

“I know you want me. I can make all your worries fade away.”

She grabbed my hand and lightly dragged me into her bedroom. She directed me to the bed and adopted an erotic pose atop it, splaying herself out before me. I stared at her longingly. A raging cocktail of emotions coursed through me. Part of me knew it was all a trick. But a bigger part of me, one that I feared I wouldn’t have the strength to subdue, urged me to give in. 

“Why don’t you join me? You know you want to.”

Jessica grinned at me slyly. I couldn’t stop it. I began to undress, shedding my clothes like a husky in the summertime. Jessica watched, eyes glowing with anticipation. I started crawling toward her like an animal. Suddenly, Jessica’s expression shifted to one of pure malice. She slid a knife from beneath one of her pillows. 

“You really think I’m that stupid? I know that you and your little friends are here to kill me. You don’t really want me. You want *her.* She’s not going to be able to save you, you know.”

Jessica sliced madly toward me, grazing my left forearm. I snapped out of my trance and leapt from the bed. Jake and Sidney burst through the door as I did so. 

*Pow.* 

I gazed up to see Jake holding my smoking handgun, and a fresh hole in Jessica’s shoulder. She dropped the knife in shock. Sidney glanced at my arm. I could see fire in her eyes. She was seeing red. She charged at Jessica, bowie knife in hand. She went ballistic, bludgeoning Jessica again and again until she was an unrecognizable mess of blood and viscera. Sidney didn’t stop until all that was left was an inky black puddle seeping into the covers. She turned to me with tears in her eyes.

“You said you wouldn’t get hurt. You promised you’d be okay. You promised.” 

She punched my good arm repeatedly as fat tears dripped down her cheeks.

“Hey, hey. I’m okay. It doesn't even hurt. It’s already starting to dry up, see? Nothing a couple of bandaids can’t fix.”

“Are you sure? It looks pretty nasty,” she whimpered.

“Yes, I’m fine. I promise. I’m flattered that you’re so concerned, though,” I said, pulling her into a hug.

“I was so worried… I thought something had happened to you.”

I released her from my grip and stared into her eyes. I again wiped away her tears and took her hand.

“Everything is alright. You saved me. I guess I should thank you.”

Color flushed into her face. 

“And I’d do it again too. Stupid skank had it coming.”

I chuckled.

“Yeah, she did. I’ll put my clothes back on and we can get out of here.”

“Good,” Jake said. 

I’d completely forgotten he was there. He averted his eyes at the sight of my pale bony body, staring holes into the floor.

“Yeah, let’s get out of here. This place makes my skin crawl,” Sidney mumbled.

“We’ll need to head home and get some rest,” I said, wrestling a sock onto my foot, “we’ve got a demon to banish.”
