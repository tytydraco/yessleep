Another night as a so-called "superhero" meant another night of confronting the worst of humanity, a far cry from the glamorized representations shown to the public to rally support for the world's heroes. In the quiet aftermath of burial neck-deep in the evil and depravity of the criminal underworld, Luca's mind drifted to the darkest of places. He remembered finding himself in a secluded spot, the silence of an abandoned cabin, with nothing but his thoughts to keep him company; awful thoughts at that, but peaceful ones that brought comfort by reminding him that this was it. Luca carried a shotgun, the weight in his hands a grim promise of an escape from his pain.

He sat down on an old chair; the creaking was the only sound polluting the air, besides the steady rush of cold winter wind outside. The barrel of the shotgun felt almost comforting as Luca pressed it against the roof of his mouth, his finger on the trigger. The metallic taste of the gun mixed with the bitter taste of betrayal in his mouth. He wanted this to end, to obliterate the memories, to silence the cacophony of rage and grief inside him.

Luca pulled the trigger. 

The explosion was deafening, a sharp, blinding flash of light and pain. His head snapped back, the roof of his mouth disintegrating under the force of the blast, and every nerve ending screamed in agony. Bone fragments, blood, and brain matter sprayed backwards, painting the wall behind him in a macabre splatter of reds, pinks, and grays.

But he wasn't dead. The back of his skull was partially missing, exposing brain tissue, the wound a ghastly crater of torn flesh and shattered bone. Blood gushed from the injury, pooling around him, but his heart, too strong to stop, kept pumping life into a body that should have been dead.

His vision blurred from the sheer trauma to his brain, never quite going black the way he imagined – the way he hoped it would. The pain was beyond comprehension, and he was conscious enough to feel every wave of it. Every throbbing pulse pooled more blood on the ground under his mutilated head. Chunks of his brain and skull were littered around the room; some skull fragments found themselves embedded in the wooden planks of the cabin.

Yet, Luca began to come to the realization that he wouldn't die from this. His body, enhanced by powers he never asked for or known about, began the slow, torturous process of healing. The wound started to knit together, but it wasn't quick; he would remain in this state of misery for days, maybe weeks, every second a reminder of the life he wanted to end and the love he wanted to forget.

He lay there, in a pool of his own blood and brain matter, the shotgun now useless beside him, realizing that even in his darkest moment, death was not an escape he was allowed. He was cursed to endure, to heal, to remember, to live with the pain, both physical and emotional, in a cycle that seemed endless.

Luca almost laughed as he pictured it, any semblance of morbid joy immediately snuffed out as he returned to his misery.

As he lay there, the initial shock of survival began to ebb, replaced by the slow, agonizing return of his bodily functions. First, it was the tingling sensation in his extremities, a sign of nerve regeneration that was both a relief and a source of new pain. The cold of the cabin floor seeped into his bones, adding to his discomfort, but he could do nothing but lie there, a feast for the eyes of any creature that might wander in.

Days passed, marked by the slow crawl of shadows across the cabin's interior. His hearing returned first, the sounds of the forest outside becoming clearer: the rustle of leaves, the call of distant birds, and the more ominous patter of small paws. Forest animals, drawn by the scent of blood and decay, began to venture closer. Rats were the first to arrive, their whiskers tickling his skin as they sniffed around the edges of his wound, finding sustenance in his ever-returning flesh, undoing days of regenerative progress with each meal. Luca's heart raced with fear and disgust, but his body was still too broken to react.

One evening, as the light began to fade, a fox entered the cabin, its hunger manifesting as a glint of desperation in its eyes. It approached cautiously, sniffing the air around Luca's head. The pain was excruciating as the creature began to nibble at the exposed flesh. With a surge of adrenaline that seemed to come from the depths of his despair, Luca managed to twitch his arm. The movement was feeble, more of a spasm than a deliberate action, but it was enough to startle the fox, which scampered away with a yelp.

Weeks turned into a blur of pain and incremental recovery. His vision was the next to return, slowly at first, like peering through a fog that gradually cleared. He could now see the grotesque tableau around him: the dried blood, the remnants of his skull, the marks of animal visits on the floor. It was a testament to his survival and his suffering.

His arms started to regain some function, enough for him to drag himself into an upright position after what felt like an eternity. His fingernails dug into the floorboard, carving bloody grooves along the floorboards as he pulled his body inch by painful inch. The effort was monumental, every movement sending waves of pain through his healing skull, but the will to live, or perhaps the fear of what would happen if he stayed down, propelled him forward.

Sitting up, he surveyed the cabin with new eyes, his vision still not perfect but functional enough to navigate. The walls bore the stains of his ordeal, and the air was thick with the smell of his own decay. He leaned against the wall, breathing heavily, each breath a mixture of relief and dread. He knew recovery would be long, his body knitting itself back together, but the mental scars, the memories of betrayal, and this near-death experience would linger far longer.

As he sat there, contemplating his next move, he realized he was not just surviving; he was being reshaped by this ordeal. Whether for better or worse, Luca was not the same young man who had entered this cabin with a shotgun, ready to die, ready to forget. He was now a survivor, marked by an experience that would define the rest of his life – an experience that would push him further, dragging him night after night out into the horrid realities of life that consumed so many, either as victims or as perpetrators. It was an experience that he carried with him to remind himself that he was meant for this, and that there was a reason for where he was now, and where he would find himself the next night, and the night after that.

Luca stood in his small, cluttered apartment, the walls covered in a chaotic collage of newspaper clippings, crime scene photos, and evidence files. With a sense of finality, he began to peel them off, each piece coming away with a soft sound, revealing the faded wallpaper beneath. He packed his gear methodically into a duffel bag, stowing away gadgets and protective clothing that had become as much a part of him as his own skin. Turning off the police radio scanner, the silence that followed was almost alien, yet comforting. During the day, he would now attempt to blend into normalcy: go to work, meet friends, enjoy the mundane – the safe. But he knew that even this sense of finality was as temporary as the one he felt in the cabin all those years ago. The city would call to him again, a wretched call of a thousand suffering voices all in harmony as one terrible scream. But in that call, buried beneath the trauma and horror, he found meaning.

Sometimes, all it really takes is a little darkness to find the light within yourself.
