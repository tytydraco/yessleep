So, right about now, you're all going to be hearing about the production of a vaccine for, "Disease-X.' An unknown, future disease.


I'm here to tell you, that in the future, there'll be a man. This one man, changed everything.


That's right, I'm another one who's claiming their from the future.


Now, I'm not going to flood you with information or bleed myself dry trying to prove to you that I am indeed from the future, that's down to you whether you believe me or not. 


I apologise if my grammar is wrong from time to time, writing in all past, present and future tenses, especially when you're from the future, it can be quite difficult to keep track sometimes.


We know him only as, Doc.


In 2011, the scientific community was outraged that researchers had actually engineered a mutant-version of the bird flu (H5N1) that was transmitted via the air. The results sparked global fears that engineered deadly diseases could inadvertently escape from the lab, or, be intentionally released. Covid-19 did not help matters. This was when Doc began his work.


In late 2023, sudden wide-spread panic occurred as an outbreak of yet another engineered disease (known as KP500-A, or just KP) was "accidentally" released by Doc and his team via powder-form, that exploded in random locations all around Europe, and eventually spreading worldwide. 


The outbreak reported that 2.4 billion people lost their lives worldwide, and a further 1.7 billion people were vaccinated. 


Unfortunately for these people, the vaccine was also engineered by Doc--Vaccine for disease "X." Apparently, it was the only known vaccine available and it changed us in ways that I still can't comprehend.


After the incubation stage, which was 3 months, it then took just 7 days for the vaccine to mutate the human DNA and turned those poor people into...well, you're going to find this hard to believe, but trust me, it happens, they turned into some kind of demonic-looking, skinless, winged humanoids.


Within these seven days, the unfortunate patient would go through absolute hell, both physically and mentally.


Day-1, the person would experience high fever, chills, headache, abdominal pain and violent vomiting.


On day-2, a rash would appear. The person would become highly contagious, irrational and delusional. They would lash out at any one who came near them, scratching and biting.


Within two days of appearance, the rash would develop into abscesses that fill with pus. The abscesses would break open and spew pus in all directions. The scabs would eventually fall off, taking **all** layers of skin with it.


By day-7, the patient would no longer be considered human.


I'm sure you can imagine the terrible world we now all live in.


Doc is out there right now, creating, tweaking and engineering the fuck out of his own powdered death concoction. 


Other than his name (Doc), we know nothing else of him or the KP-disease.


My mission is to spread the word as best I can in hopes of finding and stopping him. He could be your brother, your husband, your son...


Is anyone in your life acting ridiculously suspicious?...
