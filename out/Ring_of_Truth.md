I sat on my bed with a _sigh_ and started unpacking my bags.

 

As much as the trip to Greece was amazing, the return trip was much more exhausting. I had more suitcases to unpack and the never ending sets of clothes and souvenirs eagerly awaiting to be put away neatly in the wardrobes and on the desk.

 

After I was done with the clothes, I started unpacking my suitcases containing souvenirs, spices and a few bottles of Olive oil. 

 

After putting away the figurines, and a pair of leather sandals among other things, I started shaking the bag upside down violently to make anything small enough to dodge my hand sweep falls out of my bag.

 

And sure enough, with a clatter, a metallic ring fell onto the floor.

 

I had almost forgot about the ring!

 

During my trip in Athens, I came across a very nice and polite young shopkeeper! Her name was... uhh...

 

[Apate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apate)! Her shop was full of curious artifacts which looked really old.

 

When I was looking at which ones to buy, she suddenly called me over and seemingly produced a ring out of nowhere!

 

I was taken aback a little, but I managed to hide my surprised face. She asked me to look over the ring and asked if I’d want to buy it.

 

The ring was marvelous! It looked really old, maybe even ancient! Though it’s carvings were in a better shape than expected, the colour, which was possibly gold, had faded but mysteriously it hadn’t lost it’s shine. The mere sight of this ring captivated me!

 

Apate seemed to notice this and asked me once more, if I wanted to buy it.

 

I was jerked out of my reverie and instantly replied with a “Yes please”. Though I later wondered why I was acting weird and had zoned out, but nevertheless dismissed it.

 

I put the ring in my pocket, and after going through all the suitcases, went to sleep a little bit, after all I was exhausted from the trip.

 

After sleeping for a while, I decided to take an evening stroll and also grab something to eat at a restaurant.

 

Just as I left of house and started walking down the street, I felt a tug on my pant leg and I smilingly looked behind me. A fairly muddy puppy, who went by the name [Eleos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleos), was wagging her tail and looking up at me.

 

“I missed you too buddy!” I exclaimed. I knelt down and patted her head.

 

Eleos lived in our neighborhood. I had known this little lady for over 2 months and would meet her everyday when I would be going to and coming from my workplace.

 

After petting her for a good minute or two, I got up and continued my stroll.

 

After I reached my favourite restaurant, [_Peripeteia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripeteia), I ordered a few things and sat down to wait for my order to arrive.

 

Eventually I got bored and decided to take the ring out of my pocket and inspect it again.

 

As my hand went in my left pocket, for seemingly no reason my heart almost stopped when I didn’t find it. I hastily checked my other pocket and was relieved I found it. Still I was a little worried about how odd I’d been acting lately.

 

The ring was cold to the touch. Looking at it, I again began to wonder about it’s age. Not only did it’s condition, it’s carvings and design make it look ancient, but it also had a kind of aura around it. The aura was heavy and seemed to carry knowledge more vast than any human could comprehend. It had a '[απάτη](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CF%80%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%B7)' carving inside it. It must be a Greek word-

 

“Sir?” a voice called out.

 

I was again jerked out of my daydream as the waiter looked at me exasperatedly.

 

I quickly apologized and without realizing slid the ring on my finger and began to eat.

 

After finishing my meal, I got up and started walking back.

 

When I was walking up the street, I felt the tug again.

 

“What’s up bud?” I asked turning to face Eleos.

 

But when I saw her, a tear rolled down my face.

 

I lifted her up in my arms, such a tiny yet beautiful creature. I started caressing her head.

 

Crack!

 

I saw her big eyes grow glassy, she had a far-away look in her eyes.

 

I had saved her from her fate, a gruesome demise.

 

I had seen her death, starving, all of her silky fur gone, missing her lower body, crawling with her intestines spilled out.

 

I just saved her from her death.

 

I slowly put her down in the ground and looked at my surroundings.

 

Then I started crying.

 

Crying like a baby.

 

I saw the fate of all of them. So many people, who don’t have the slightest clue of their death.

 

Slowly the salty taste of tears in my mouth turned into the taste of iron.

 

I wiped my tears and dried my eyes.

 

I have been blessed with this knowledge. And I shall put it to good use.

 

I’m going to save them all.

 

I’m going to kill them all.
