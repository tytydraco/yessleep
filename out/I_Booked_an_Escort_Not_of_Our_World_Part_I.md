[PART II](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1n88i4b/i_booked_an_escort_not_of_our_world_part_ii/) is up! You can find it in the link!

It started like any other day.

I work a typical 9 to 5 in a gray-walled office wedged between a refinery and a cold storage depot. It was nothing glamorous. Just payroll, inventory, and data entry. The warehouse out back hums with forklifts and pallets and smells like oil, steel, and stale coffee. It’s industrial purgatory. My job is to make sure the numbers line up and nobody’s skimming off the top.

I usually clock out around dusk, when the sodium lights flicker on and the sky turns bruised and yellow. That night, I lingered a little longer—triple-checking a shipment invoice that didn’t sit right. A truckload of supplies had gone unlogged. No signature, no weight data, no product line. Just a blank space where there should have been something. Or someone.

From my second-floor office window, I had a clear view of the backloading dock.

That’s when I saw the truck.

A large, white freight hauler—unmarked, the kind that smells like bleach and cold sweat—backed into the far bay with its lights off. It rolled in slow, deliberate, like it didn’t want to be seen. A man in a reflective vest emerged from the cab, then opened the rear doors.

And then… they stepped out one by one.

Four women. At first glance, they looked like human girls, but they had unusual features. I couldn’t quite make them out as they each wore oversized coats they pulled tight around their bodies, as if they were trying to disappear into the fabric. Their eyes were wide searching the shadows, like prey searching for their predators. One stumbled slightly as she hit the concrete, catching herself with trembling fingers.

I should’ve called someone.

But something stopped me. Something about their faces.

They were beautiful. Almost too beautiful. The kind of beauty that feels more *designed* than born. I squinted against the glass, trying to parse what I was seeing.

For example, one woman’s skin had a faint reddish hue, not from blush or windburn, but something deeper. She had undertones that shimmered when the light caught her cheek just right. Small, curling horns poked through the top of her head, as her dark black hair was cropped short just below her neck.

They looked too connected to her forehead to be prosthetic.

I told myself they were costumes. Makeup. Some kind of elaborate viral stunt. A haunted house promo maybe, or one of those weird immersive theater things rich people pay thousands for.

But what kind of show leaves its actors looking like they’re terrified out of their minds? What kind of role demands fear that raw?

One of the girls looked right at me.

I caught the longing in her eyes, the fear, and the desperation. And in that moment, I knew she wasn’t playing a part.

None of them were.

A few men emerged from the yawning darkness of the warehouse. Their movements were slow, casual, like this was routine. No shouting, no barking of orders. Just calm, practiced movements. They didn’t have uniforms, but they wore dark jackets and work gloves. One of them held a clipboard, as if this was just another delivery to log.

The girls hesitated at the edge of the truck’s shadow, but a sharp gesture from one of the men sent them filing inside in a single, obedient line. No protest. No resistance. Just the slow, hollow shuffle of sandaled feet on concrete as they filed one by one single file into the warehouse.

Something about their silence made the hair rise on my arms.

Without thinking, I grabbed my keys and left the building. My heart jackhammered in my chest as I went to the back of the building, out of sight, where my vehicle was parked. I slid into my car and pulled away from my usual spot, circling around the far end of the lot, just past a rusted chain-link fence, where many unused vehicles remained in an unpaved lot. I tucked in beside a few of them, out of view, and killed the engine.

From there, I had a clear line of sight to the warehouse’s open bay.

The men were stripping the girls.

They peeled away the oversized coats like they were shedding packaging. The garments hit the floor in limp piles, revealing the girls' barely clothed bodies. Just jean shorts and bikini tops were covering them. The warehouse lights glared down on their skin, sterile and unflinching.

Each girl stood stiff as a statue. Eyes shut tight, arms locked at their sides like it might protect them, or maybe because they’d been told not to move. Their bodies trembled slightly in the chill, but they didn’t make a sound.

And then I saw them.

Really saw them.

The green-skinned girl was the first to break my sense of disbelief. Her hair was writhing, coiling. At first, I thought it was some kind of clever prop, but my blood chilled when I now got a better look. Each strand of her hair was alive, wriggling independently like it had its own mind.

Snakes! Her hair was made of snakes!

They hissed and coiled, agitated, though she stood perfectly still. Her skin wasn’t painted. It was smooth, lime-colored, patterned faintly with scales that shimmered under the fluorescent lights. Her pupils were vertical slits, and I swear—when she opened her eyes for a flicker of a second—she looked directly at me.

The red-skinned girl beside her was slightly taller, her horns curling back over her head like ram's horns, polished and dark. Her skin was a muted crimson, not firetruck red but more like old blood. There was something subtly wrong with the air around her, like heat shimmered off her body even though it was cold. Her expression was blank, distant, but her lips parted slightly, showing two elongated canines.

She had to be a succubus.

The aquatic girl, blue as sea glass, stood next to her. Her skin had a faint iridescence, and her collarbones bore subtle ridges where her gills fluttered, as if testing the air. Her eyes were wide and silver-flecked, and her feet, fully webbed, shifted on the concrete like she didn’t know how to stand upright for long. She had long, elaborate dark blue hair that cascaded down her back. She looked... newer. Less hardened. Her arms were mostly human, but around her elbows the scales thickened, hinting at something underneath that didn’t belong on land.

She looked a lot like a mermaid, only with legs.

And then there was the third woman, the fairy.

God, she looked fragile. And she was so small. She had to be no taller than five feet. The kind of thin that suggested she hadn’t eaten in weeks. Her skin was a cold shade of ivory with almost runic veins etched all over her body in elaborate patterns. Her mouth was clamped shut, but when she turned slightly, I caught a glimpse of her wings. They were long, slender, not the cartoonish kind, but real, elaborate and elegant. Her normally happy expression was absent, replaced by a cold, gaunt look.

One of the men walked up behind them and began fastening black zip ties around their wrists; tight, unforgiving. He moved mechanically, as though binding exotic animals for transport. He looped their ankles with chains, thin enough to walk in, thick enough to control. The girls flinched at the contact but said nothing. The succubus winced as the plastic bit into her wrists. The mermaid’s eyes welled slightly, but the tears didn’t fall.

Then the man did something that made my blood run cold.

He slapped the gorgon across the ass, hard. The sound echoed through the empty lot like a gunshot. She didn’t react. She didn’t cry out or turn her head. But I saw the snakes recoil violently, hissing, writhing with fury she couldn’t show.

The men herded them deeper into the warehouse like livestock.

I just sat there, trying to process what the fark I was seeing.

Because in that moment, one horrifying thought lodged deep in my skull:

These girls weren’t just being trafficked.

They weren’t even human.

My fingers were frozen on the steering wheel, heart pounding so hard it made my vision pulse. My brain was screaming at me to call someone. Anyone! But who the hell would believe me? Hey, officer, I just watched four mythological monster girls get taken into a warehouse at the center of the city.

Yeah, because 911 wouldn’t tell me not to tie up the line.

As they were led further inside, the light grew dimmer. The warehouse swallowed them, but not entirely. A single floodlight buzzed overhead, casting a broad yellow cone over a low, makeshift couch positioned just beyond the bay entrance—cobbled together from old cushions and tarp-covered padding. It looked like something torn from a brothel or holding cell. Stained. Improvised. *Used*.

The girls were sat there in a silent row, facing the lot. Facing *me*.

I sank lower in my seat, heart pounding again. From the shadows of the junked patrol cars, wedged between a rusted pickup and a hollowed-out school bus, I prayed they couldn’t see me.

But something told me they could.

The men who brought them in moved to the back of the warehouse. One flipped a switch. The bay doors began to roll shut with a slow metallic groan, but they stopped just shy of closing completely. Maybe five or six feet off the ground. Enough to let in air. Or maybe to let something else out.

Then they left the girls alone.

And in the silence that followed, the girls sat motionless—like artifacts on display, too exhausted to cry and too hopeless to run. Their heads drooped, and their limbs, still bound, trembled subtly. Some stared at nothing. Others scanned the warehouse’s rusted walls with the expression of someone already dreaming of escape.

Then, all at once, their eyes locked with mine.

It was almost imperceptible. No sudden movement. No gasp. Just a shift subtle, mechanical, instinctive—as their eyes aligned with mine. As if they’d known I was there. It wase the whole time. As if they’d been *waiting*.

Their gazes didn’t move from me. They didn’t dare turn their heads, didn’t twitch or gesture or alert their handlers. They stayed perfectly still, communicating only through their eyes. A look passed between them, brief, but barely perceptible. Then back to me.

And what I saw in their expressions wasn’t malice or hunger.

It was *grief*. Unfiltered, soul-flattening *grief*. The kind you don’t fake.

The gorgon girl sat with her knees pressed tightly together, her wrists zip-tied behind her back, shoulders curled forward like she was trying to hide her form. Her snakes no longer moved—they hung limp, defeated, as if they, too, had been broken. Her green skin was mottled now, blotched along her arms and thighs, and there were bruises and deep purple welts just below her bikini line. Her eyes locked on mine. And behind them, desperation.

The succubus looked older. Not by years, but by mileage. Her light red skin shimmered faintly under the light, not glittery but *raw*, like an open wound healing over. Her horns curved back like polished obsidian, beautiful but scarred—one chipped at the base, like it had been cracked with a blunt instrument. Her chest was bound by a fraying bikini top that looked too tight, clearly not designed for comfort. Her lips moved slightly, whispering something I couldn’t hear.

The mermaid girl sat with her legs drawn up, feet tucked beneath her. Her blue-scaled skin looked drier than before, as though the air was hurting her. The edges of her gills twitched, struggling to take in oxygen, and her chest rose and fell rapidly. Her bikini top was damp in places, stained with something that didn’t look like water. There were red rings around her wrists, deeper than the others, like she'd struggled the most. Her silver eyes welled with tears that never fell.

And the fairy girl…

She sat straight-backed, as if posture was all she had left. Her legs were crossed at the ankles, but the chain dug into her skin, leaving little bloody half-moons. Her skin was paler than the others, almost translucent now, the veins beneath glowing faintly blue in the dark. Her eyes, glimmering like diamonds, glinted as they found mine. She looked at me the longest.

It wasn’t hunger. It was *recognition*. Like she knew who I was. Or had known someone like me once. And still, I didn’t move. A part of me *wanted* to. To leap from the car and scream at the men, alert law enforcement, rush in there with a tire iron like some kind of bargain-bin savior. But another part, deeper, colder, hesitated.

Because I *knew* things. I’d read the stories. The reports. The conspiracy threads.

Succubi don’t need consent. They drain you while you sleep. Medusas turn men to stone—sometimes only from the waist down. And mermaids? The old kind, the *real* kind? Much of mythology says they pulled sailors into the deep just to watch them drown. And lastly, not all fairies were benevolent.

These women could have lured dozens to their deaths. Maybe more. Could I really afford to take my chances? But if that was true, if these weren’t victims but predators..

Then who were *those men*?

I glanced back at the warehouse. No insignias. No badges. No containment gear. Just gloves and zip ties. Who do they work for anyway?

If they were from the SCP Foundation, or the Global Occult Coalition, or whatever black-budget monster-hunting agency the internet whispered about, why were they *here* of all places? Why a rotting warehouse off I-95 in the industrial epicenter of North Miami? Why not a deep-sea lab or some forest bunker where no one could see? It didn’t make sense. But it was more reason to believe that this wasn’t containment. It was commerce.

And I had a suspicion as to precisely what kind.

My hands moved before my conscience could catch up. I pulled out my phone, my heart was still pounding, and didn’t even bother opening Google. This wasn’t something I’d find on Yelp.

So, I downloaded Tor. Because whatever those girls were, they weren’t the only ones being sold. And I guarantee you I wouldn’t have found them anywhere else.

Within minutes, I was browsing the dark web and it wasn’t long before I discovered the classifieds. I wont go into detail of what else I came across, just know I found what I was looking for.

It surprisingly did not take too long. Within minutes I was browsing escorts on an exclusive dark web form. And I found women of various ‘exotic’ subspecies on a website not normally accessible on google. They had fairies, pixies, succubae, harpies, and even the bird-like sirens all available for ‘rent’ on their site. They have clients of all kinds, ranging from human to non-human.

Confirmed.

My only question was, if they were being trafficked from other dimensions or worlds, then it would stand to reason that some kind of government agency would be watching stuff like this. Getting curious, I decided to look up the instructions needed to ‘book’ a session.

But before I could type a single letter, something happened.

A low mechanical whine filled the air outside my vehicle, coming from across the lot. I looked up from the phone to turn my gaze immediately upon the warehouse. I saw the door yawning open. Thick shadows peeled away as halogen lights spilled out from within. And there they were.

The girls. All four of them. Led out in single file, like livestock.

The two men from before—heavyset, pale-skinned, wearing nondescript utility jackets—ushered them forward with quick, mechanical hand gestures. I could hear faint commands muffled through the air: “Keep your eyes down.” “Move.” “No noise.”

They didn’t need to threaten. The girls were already broken in.

Each of them was bound now. Not just zip ties around their wrists like before, but full restraints—ankles shackled together with thick, black iron cuffs, arms trussed behind their backs with heavy leather belts. And this time… each one had a **ball gag** strapped into their mouths, tightly enough that their cheeks bulged and their breathing rasped through their nostrils.

Their outfits—if you could even call them that—were degraded even further. Small bikini tops stretched taut across their chests, barely covering anything. Short shorts clung to their hips like afterthoughts, riding high between their thighs. They weren’t costumes anymore. They were *uniforms*. Assigned. Dehumanizing.

The **gorgon woman** walked at the front. Her green skin shimmered slightly under the fluorescent light, and her snake-hair writhed weakly, like it had been sedated. Her eyes scanned the area as she walked, darting left and right in brief jerks. She looked for an escape route, maybe. I watched her gaze pass over the lot. And then, it hit my car. Her pupils sharpened. Locked. Our eyes met.

Behind her, the **succubus** shuffled forward, her crimson skin marked with bruises along her ribs. Her horns had been shaved down since I last saw her. Roughly. Unevenly. A punishment, maybe. Her tail twitched behind her like it was trying to hide.

The **mermaid girl** walked in stiff, halting steps, her webbed toes curled in shame. Her gills flared weakly with each shallow breath, irritated from the dry air. She winced with every step, like the asphalt burned her feet.

The fairy, or nymph-like girl was the last to be loaded. She was tiny—no taller than 4’11, but the way she moved, the way her body trembled with each step, she looked even smaller. Fragile. Breakable. Her translucent wings had been cruelly pinned—folded tight against her back beneath a leather harness that pressed down hard, the wing joints visibly strained and twitching under the weight. Every few seconds, they fluttered instinctively, as if trying to open, only to be jerked back down by the restraint.

They were loaded into a large white truck again—same model as before, only now without the subtlety. The rear doors were wide open, revealing a padded interior with low red lights, a bench lining either side, and steel rings bolted to the walls—anchor points

One by one, the girls were pushed up the small ramp and chained inside. The doors slammed shut with the finality of a tomb.

I made a decision.

I threw my phone into the passenger seat and turned the key in the ignition. I didn’t care about the form anymore. I needed to *know* where they were going. I pulled out slowly, keeping three car lengths behind the truck as it rolled out of the warehouse lot and onto the main road. I killed my headlights.

The city was quiet at this hour, nothing but low neon glows and the occasional flicker of a crosswalk sign. The truck didn’t move fast. Like it had no fear of being followed.

It took me less than ten minutes to realize where they were going.

**The Strip is just outside the Miami International Airport.**

A ring of sleazy motels, gas stations, hourly-rate rooms, and concrete towers baking under yellow-orange streetlamps. I passed a billboard advertising “Fantasy Island Spa” and another offering discounted “companionship services.” Every building seemed to lean sideways with mildew and regret.

The truck pulled into the back lot of a one-story motel that didn’t even bother hiding its purpose. No signs. No lights. Just faded brick and boarded-up windows. The kind of place where you checked in through a thick glass slot and never asked for towels.

I parked again, this time behind a shuttered laundromat across the street. I watched the men open the back doors to the truck.

First came the **gorgon woman** again. Still at the front. Her feet dragged as they pulled her out by the arm. She tried to resist, but her shackled legs gave her no leverage. One of the men *shoved* her forward, and she fell hard onto the gravel, the gag making a wet, choking thud against her lips. She whimpered. A sound I could barely hear but *felt* in my teeth.

The snakes on her head twitched frantically, like they were trying to fight back. Two men got out of the vehicle and hoisted her up. She walked gingerly on two feet barely covered with sandals, the two men guiding her up the paved sidewalk.

The motel itself met every definition of ‘seedy’ you could think of. It was only one story, and the building itself couldn’t have had more than a dozen rooms carved into it. The overhead sign was gone, and the neon-lit vacancy light was only half lit. A single row of doors lit by flickering amber bulbs that hummed with bugs

The faded green paint peeling like sunburned skin and security bars warped from age or misuse. The overhead sign was gone, torn off or collapsed long ago. Only a skeletal frame remained, rusted through and straining against the wind. Beneath it, a busted neon *VACANCY* light glowed half-lit and stuttering, casting the letters *V-A-C-C-Y* across the parking lot like a joke no one was in on. The place looked like it was functional, but barely.

I saw them take the gorgon woman to one of the doors, I faintly made out the number 12 just above as the door opened and she was escorted inside. I looked back down at my phone, and reopened the Tor browser. My eyes went to the unnamed website where I found the escort services. I adjusted my location accordingly to Miami.

I waited a few minutes.

And then, I found her. It was the gorgon woman. I texted the number below. I waited a few more minutes before I got a response. The reply came in a green text bubble. Simple. Too simple.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

That was it. There was no name or greeting. Just a blunt set of instructions. It felt less like an invitation and more of a transaction.

I stared at the message for a while. My thumb hovered over the screen. A part of me kept waiting for a second reply. Or a clarification. Or maybe even a joke, but that was wishful thinking at this point. I wanted a reason not to go in there, and there were too many to list. I wanted to believe that the gorgon lady wanted to eat me, or turn me into stone. But I just couldn’t.

I glanced back across the street.

Room 12 was dark again, the window light had been clicked off. The only thing marking it from the other rooms was the faint, uneven scrawl of the number above the door, its paint chipping off.

The parking lot was still empty. No cars, pedestrians or other signs of life, except for a single curtain twitching in one of the rooms further down the row. I didn’t like that. Someone was watching. Or something was. I sat back in the seat and tried to breathe, but my lungs were tight.

This wasn’t curiosity anymore. Not really. It was something colder, heavier. Like I’d seen too much already, and now I wasn’t *allowed* to look away. No. I *couldn’t* look away.

I stared at the message again.

**Room 12. Come alone. 100 per hour. Cash only.**

I took a deep breath and exited my vehicle, making my way across the street and to the motel. I walked up to door number 12. I knocked twice. I technically was a brown belt in BJJ and had light striking skills with taekwondo, so in that department I had some kind of plan should someone want to get physical with me.

After a few minutes, the door slowly opened, and the gorgon woman looked up at me. I saw that she was covered in a silky smooth, see-through bathrobe. She tucked a few snakes behind her ear as she let off a meek, yet nervous smile.

“Please come in.”

I nodded as she took my hand and guided me into the room. Her hand was cold.

Her 5’2 frame he gently guided my 5’10 self to the bed. The snakes coiled behind her ear twitched once more as if whispering something I wasn’t meant to hear.

The door shut behind me with a soft click that sounded louder than it should have in the silence. The room was dimly lit, only by a bedside lamp with a cracked shade. The air was thick with a strange mix of scents: cheap rosewater, stale sweat, and perfume that had a rosy, yet pungent odor. It was inviting, yet it stung my nostrils.

There was no music, or TV. Only the sounds of her and my breathing filled the room.

She gently sat me down on the bed an stood over me. She then very slowly undid the sash, dropping it to the floor, letting the robe fall open. She was wearing a tight-fitting thong and a bra. It wasn’t long before I noticed the cuts, bruises and welts along her body. Her eyes were heavy.

“Are you okay?”

She forced a smile and nodded, then straddling me on the bed. She begun to ravish my neck, purring like a kitten.

“So strong. So handsome.” She giggled.

“I don’t want to have sex.”

She then looked at me like I killed ten people. I then picked her up and gently laid her on the bed. She sat up to look at me as I sat down next to her.

“Can we… talk?”

She tilted her head. “Talk?”

I nodded.

Her eyes went wide as she pressed her fingers to her temple. “T-talk? You w-want to-you want to talk?”

I nodded. “To get to know you better.”

Her eyes widened as she just stared at me like I was the president of the United States.

“Nobody has …I don’t….” she stammered, and then shook her head. “Im not allowed to answer questions.”

I then heard a pounding on the door.

“Alina! You better not be telling anyone anything about us!” she heard someone scream.

“Oh no. He sounds drunk.” She raved, and then turned to me. “You need to-”

The door slammed open and a tall man about my height came out.

“You! Outside! Me and the lady need to have a little talk.”

I glanced at the gorgon woman. Now the fresh tears were streaming down her face as she clutched the blanket from the bed to her chest.

I got up from the bed, frozen and I just stared at the man, my stupid neurodivergence not knowing what to do.

“Are you deaf?! Leave now!” he then stormed over to me.

His breath hit my face, sour and hot, as he grabbed a fistful of my collar. My brain lagged for a split second, choking on the sudden pressure, the shouting, the chaos.

And then everything snapped into place. I didn’t think—I *reacted*. I went for a straight body lock, my hips turning, and I drove him backwards off his balance, tackling him hard onto the dirty motel floor with a hollow *THUMP* that shook the lampshade.

The moment he went to the ground, I immediately got into position wrapping my legs around one of his. He tried to scramble, but I was already repositioning.

I grabbed his leg, controlled the heel, dropped my weight sideways, and twisted. Fast. Brutal. A perfect heel hook. There was a pop. Then a scream. High-pitched, animal, involuntary.

He flailed, slamming his fists on the floor, howling in raw, guttural pain as his knee exploded under the torque. I moved over to his head and executed an anaconda choke around his neck. He was out cold in seconds.

I stood, chest heaving.

The gorgon woman was still on the bed, shaking, her snakes hissing low and defensive around her face like a living halo. But she was staring at me differently now, with widened eyes filled with awe and admiration.

“You-” she stuttered. “-You fought for me.”

I shrugged. “I guess I did what anyone would do.”

She let off a slight smirk, looking up at me like a lost child who just found her mother. She let out a breath that was almost a laugh, and a small, trembling smile curled at her lips.

I turned to her, helping her off the floor. “Alina, we don’t have much time.”

She took my hand slowly, like she was afraid she’d wake up if she moved too fast. Her fingers were cold and delicate, but they gripped mine like she didn’t want to let go, a light smirk playing on her lips.

I peaked out the door. I didn’t see anyone. Then I turned back to Alina.

“Can you walk?” I asked.

“I think so.” She then winced. Her balance swayed as she stood, her hand slapping against the wall to steady herself.

“Then we’re leaving. Right now.”

We stepped out into the heavy, damp night air. The parking lot was still empty—no headlights, no engines, no sign of the other traffickers. We both emerged from the room. But she was still wobbly, holding onto the doorframe for support. I turned back to her.

“Ugh. My head.” She said holding a hand to her head.

Without thinking, I moved back to her, and swept her up into my arms. She was lighter than I expected—like she was made of silk and bone and smoke. Her arms instinctively wrapped around my neck, her face resting just under my chin. I felt her breath on my collarbone. Soft, yet Shaky. The snakes on her head curled quietly, docile now, like they too had calmed.

After a few steps, I felt her shift slightly in my arms.

“You smell like… laundry detergent,” she murmured, voice barely audible.

I tilted my head. “Is… that a bad thing?”

“It’s… warm,” she said, slightly giggling. “You’re warm.”

I glanced down. Her cheeks had gone faintly pink, and she was staring up at me, eyelids heavy. That little smile returned, slightly drowsy, but undeniably real. Something soft bloomed between us, buried beneath the fear and bruises and neon motel lights.

As we walked over to the car, she reached up with her hand to trace my jawline, her touch featherlight—like she wasn’t sure I was solid. Her smile brightened, a flicker of something radiant breaking through the haze of everything she'd endured.

I opened the passenger door for her. She hesitated only a moment before slipping in, curling up against the seat like it was the first real rest she’d had in days. Maybe weeks. As I pulled away from the laundromat, the silence in the car felt different. Not empty. Just… full of things we couldn’t say yet.

The cite rolled past in blurred halos of orange and blue. Traffic lights blinked on empty corners. Planes cut across the sky far overhead, heading to places that still felt like fiction to people like us. Every now and then, I could feel her eyes on me. Watching. Studying. Not in fear, but in curiosity. Like she was trying to memorize me. Each time I glanced over, she’d quickly look away, but not before I caught the edge of a smile playing on her lips.

Outside, the streets of Miami drifted by, quiet and gleaming with midnight sheen. But inside that car, something had changed. This wasn’t a rescue anymore. It wasn’t survival.

It was the start of something else.

Something far more nefarious than a local escort ring.

I pulled into the quiet suburban street just after 2:00 a.m. The neighborhood was still, with only the hum of distant sprinklers and the occasional wind chime from a neighbor’s porch disturbed the silence. The house sat near the end of the cul-de-sac. I always found some comfort in its symmetry allowing me a clear view of the whole circle.

I parked in the driveway, shut off the engine, and turned to Alina. She was asleep the whole ride, her head resting against the passenger window.

“We’re here.” I said flatly.

She got up and opened her eyes. Her snakes twitched softly under the dome light.

I got out and opened the passenger side door for her, offering my hand. She looked up at me tenderly, her snakes hissing quietly, sniffing my hand with their forked tongues. She reached up and took it with a smirk, fluttering her eyes up at me as she stumbled out of the vehicle and onto her feet.

She winced once when her bare foot touched the concrete, but she said nothing. Her arms clung to mine as they moved, probably still getting over the effects of the drugs. She gradually, however, regained her footing.

Inside, the house smelled faintly of lavender fragrances and books. The kind of place that held warmth in the walls and memories in the carpet. It was a typical suburban home.

“My dads in New York with his fiancée,” I explained, leading her down the hall. “And my mom’s in Texas visiting my aunt. I’m house-sitting. Keeping things in shape. Paying rent. It’s not much, but it’s safe.”

She didn’t say a word as her eyes went all around the house, quietly taking in the framed photos, the soft lighting, the reality of it all. She looked like she didn’t know whether to cry or collapse. I stopped at the guest room door and opened it for her.

There was a clean queen-sized bed with folded gray blankets, a small desk, a reading lamp, and a single dresser. But compared to where she'd come from, it might as well have been heaven. She walked in slowly, running her fingers along the blanket, like she was scared it would disappear. Then she turned to me.

"Martin?" she said softly.

I tilted my head from the doorway. “Yeah?”

“Can you… stay with me?” Her voice cracked just slightly. “Just for tonight. I don’t… I don’t want to be alone.”

I hesitated for a beat. Not because I didn’t want to—but because of the way she looked up at me. From her 5'2 height, tilted her chin, her golden-green eyes wide and shimmering under the soft hallway light. Her snakes curled slightly inward, almost bashful, like they were reflecting her nervousness

I rubbed the back of my neck. “Oh-Ok.”

She smiled, an actual, genuine smile, gleaming pearly whites. The tension in her shoulders dropped. She climbed onto the bed slowly, curling up near the pillows but leaving space beside her.

I slowly sauntered over and sat down at the edge of the bed, unsure of what to do. I felt awkward, towering beside her, my 5'11 frame making the bed dip slightly. But she didn’t seem to mind. If anything, she scooted closer.

“Are you gonna lie down?” she pouted, looking up at me with longing eyes.

I nodded, then slowly rested next to her. She immediately snuggled up next to me and buried her face in my neck, wrapping her arm around my torso. She curled gently into my side. I could feel her smiling and giggling

“You’re warm.” she purred.

I looked down at her, and then really noticed how delicate, yet beautiful she looked under the lamplight. Bruised, but strong. Shaken, but resilient. And… Jesus Christ she was gorgeous.

I just reached over and pulled the blanket up around us both and killed the light. Her breathing slowed. Her snakes finally went still.

I laid back with her, letting the silence wrap around us like another layer of warmth.

And just before sleep pulled her under, she murmured, almost inaudibly:

“Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it.” I half smiled.

And in the dark, with her hand on my chest and her cheek against his shoulder, she finally closed her eyes. I did too.

That was probably the best sleep I have had in a while.
