Hello everyone,

I live in a small village, tucked away in the mountains—one of those places where time seems to move slower and old traditions never quite fade. Life here is quiet, maybe too quiet for most people, but I’ve grown used to it. The villagers still talk about things like spirits and curses, but it’s usually just for fun. At least, that’s what I thought.

What happened to me over the past few weeks has changed that.

It all started during a visit to a neighbor’s house, a man named Doru who’s lived in the village his entire life. My parents and I were over for one of those casual gatherings that happen every so often. It was a chilly night, the kind where the fog rolls in early and hangs low to the ground. We were all sitting in his living room, sipping coffee and exchanging small talk when the conversation turned to local legends.

Doru, usually a quiet man, leaned forward. His face looked serious, almost too serious for the kind of talk we were having.

“There’s something I’ve never told many people,” he began, his voice low and steady. “A few of you might’ve heard whispers about it. But it’s real—happened to someone I knew.”

We all quieted down. There was something in his voice, something uneasy, that made us lean in.

Doru told us about a man who had lived just a few houses down from him when he was a boy. He never named the man, and I didn’t ask. The man had begun hearing strange noises at night. At first, it was nothing unusual—just the sounds of the wind, or maybe a stray animal. But one night, he woke up to the sound of someone calling his name. It was faint, like it was coming from just outside his bedroom window.

The man thought he was dreaming at first. He ignored it and went back to sleep. But the next night, it happened again, and this time the voice was louder, clearer—definitely someone calling his name.

Frustrated and half-asleep, he got up, opened the window, and yelled out, asking who was there. Doru said the man expected to see a prankster or maybe a neighbor, but instead, he saw two eyes glowing in the darkness, just beyond his fence.

Doru paused, looking around the room as if to gauge our reactions. He described how the eyes were too high up to belong to any animal or person. They hovered unnaturally in the dark, just staring at the man, not moving, not blinking.

The man panicked. He slammed the window shut and ran to wake his wife, but after that night, he was never the same. He refused to talk about what he’d seen, and he moved away a few months later. No one in the village ever heard from him again.

As Doru finished the story, my parents chuckled nervously, dismissing it as just another tall tale. But I couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling that settled in my chest. Doru wasn’t smiling. He looked pale, like just telling the story had drained something from him. And he caught my eye before we left, his expression serious.

“Don’t ever answer a voice calling your name at night,” he said quietly. “No matter what.”

That night, back home, I couldn’t sleep. I kept thinking about those glowing eyes and the voice calling from the darkness. The village is quiet at night—too quiet sometimes—and every little creak or gust of wind suddenly seemed amplified. Still, I eventually drifted off.

Two nights later, I heard it.

I was lying in bed, half-asleep, when a sound pulled me awake. It was faint at first, like a whisper carried on the wind. I thought I imagined it, but then I heard it again—someone was calling my name.

I shot up in bed, heart pounding. My window was cracked open, and the voice sounded like it was coming from just outside, almost too soft to be sure. I told myself I was still dreaming, but I couldn’t shake the chill running down my spine. It felt too real.

I lay back down, trying to calm my racing thoughts, but the voice came again—this time clearer. “Hey… come to the window.”

It was unmistakably my name. Whoever—or whatever—was outside, they knew my name. I froze in bed, my pulse hammering in my ears. My first instinct was to throw the window shut, but Doru’s warning rang in my head: “Don’t ever answer.”

The voice came again, softer, more coaxing. It sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it. “Just open the window… I need to talk to you.”

I stayed frozen, not moving a muscle. I didn’t know what to do. Part of me wanted to just peek through the blinds, to see if maybe it was just a prank, but something deep inside me told me not to.

That’s when I heard footsteps. Slow, deliberate steps crunching in the gravel just outside. My heart felt like it would burst out of my chest. I listened, straining to hear if they would fade away, but they didn’t. They got closer.

I felt a cold sweat trickle down my back.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I crept out of bed, keeping low to the floor, and reached out to close the window without making a sound. The footsteps stopped right as I touched the window frame. My breath caught in my throat.

And then I heard it—right outside the window, so close I could have reached through the glass and touched whoever was standing there.

“Why won’t you open the window?”

It was my voice. The exact same tone, the exact same cadence, like a perfect copy of my own voice calling out to me. I stumbled back, heart pounding so hard I thought I might pass out. My knees buckled, and I hit the floor, gasping for air.

I don’t know how long I sat there, listening to that imitation of my voice repeat the same phrase, over and over, pleading for me to open the window. But I didn’t. I stayed there until the first light of dawn filtered through the curtains, and the voice finally faded.

I thought it was over after that. I didn’t hear the voice the next night, or the one after that. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed. I started noticing small things—things I couldn’t explain. Objects in my room would be in different places when I woke up. My window, which I always made sure was locked now, would be cracked open in the morning.

A week later, I heard footsteps again. This time, in the middle of the day. I was walking through the woods near the village, clearing my head after another sleepless night. The forest was empty—no one else goes out there much. But as I walked, I heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps behind me. I stopped, the hair on my arms standing on end, and turned around. There was no one.

I tried to convince myself it was just the wind or an animal. But as I turned back to the trail, I heard it again.

My voice.

Calling my name from deep in the woods.

I ran. I didn’t stop until I was back at my house, my chest burning, my legs shaking. The voice hasn’t stopped since. Sometimes, I hear it late at night, just outside my window. Other times, I hear it when I’m walking through the village. Always my own voice, calling to me from the shadows, asking me to answer.

I haven’t told anyone about this. Who would believe me? I can barely believe it myself. But every night, I wonder if one day I’ll give in—if one day, I’ll open that window or follow that voice into the woods.

And I’m terrified of what will happen if I do.
