I've decided to continue chronologically, to the best of my memory, so next place I went to was south New Jersey.

After leaving Virginia I drove up and through Maryland, went through Delaware and Pennsylvania on the Interstate before exiting and heading toward the turnpike and exiting right before going to Florence, NJ. I stopped in Burlington and paid for a motel, I paid for the week. While receiving the key to my room a man entered the motel with three deep gashes going across his torso from his left shoulder down to his right hip. I stopped and headed toward him and asked what happened. The only words he got out was "Jersey Devil" before collapsing. I hollered at the cashier to call 911 as I tore his shirt off and tied the scraps together and used it to wrap around the wound and create pressure to slow the bleeding.

After the ambulance arrived and the cops took our statements I asked about this Jersey Devil, one of the medics... emt, whatever they're called, gulped and grabbed my arm, she pulled me to the side and explained the Jersey Devil is of the Leed family, a band of misfits where mother Leed prayed her last child would be a devil. Nine months later she gave birth to her last child, the boy was born with blue eyes and blonde hair. Right after birthing his eyes turned red and hair like course coal, his skin became akin to leather as wings sprouted from his back and his nose and mouth became a snout. His feet turned to hooves and hands grew clawed, as if on cue when transformation completed, he killed his mother and flew off. That shit was fucking horrifying.

Once the EMT finished her story they were ready to leave so she hopped into the back of the ambulance and left. I headed to my room just down the hall and rested for the night, I knew the next day was going to be a long one. When I awoke it was already day, I searched on google maps for the nearest Roman Catholic Church, it was in Moorestown. Man technology has come so far I remember when flip phone were considered revolutionary, anyways when I arrived I walked in and sat on a pew, a few minutes later a priest came up to me and asked "How are you doing my son, have you come to praise our lord god?", I simply responded "Father forgive me but I have not, I came for you" as I rose to meet him he caught a wiff of something and said under his breathe "you smell of death", I froze for a moment, shaking I fearfully thought what does he mean. As I stood, I asked if he has heard of the Jersey Devil, he took a step back. I explained "I'm trying to kill it; I need to know anything I can. Any weaknesses, anything I can say to scare it, anything helps... Father". The priest finally said "My name is John; it seems you're similar to our exorcists. Give me a moment." Father John stepped off and went behind the alter, he came back with a vial of holy water and a paper with two numbers written on it his office number and the number to an exorcist he trusts. From there I left, I added the numbers into my phone... Father John and Chris.

I went to the nearest firearms store, what a surprise this state sucks when it comes to them, no buying guns without a Jersey Gun License... same goes for ammo. So, to Philly I went. An hour drive and I arrived and bought a bag of .380 ACP Hollow point. I drove back to my motel room spotting a bar about a block away from my motel. I arrived at the hotel and threw my Glock 42 and ankle holster into a backpack, I also tossed in my ammo and a drill, and I carried the vial of Holy water father John had precured me into my room. I drilled into the hollow points and dripped the Holy water into it. Before crimping the bullets down with the pliers on my multitool. I tested the bullets by holding them upside down, nothing dripped out. I then repeated that 11 more times before loading 2 mags and holstering my weapon.

By the time I finished everything it was a little after 5 pm, the day had been long and stressful, so I went to the bar. I didn't drive since it was close, so I went by foot. When I walked in, I ordered a beer, Guiness to be exact. As I began to drink a man came stumbling into the bar and immediately the bar tender yelled at him "Get out, you know you're banned!" The man stumbled forward and threw a haymaker at the bartender. It was slow and telegraphed so I stepped in and threw him down, I kept hold of his arm and dragged him outside, never did I expect to see a sigil tattooed on his wrist like that. It looked like something from the Greater and Lesser keys of Solomon. So, I stopped, shook that I'd see anything from that book again; he stood up and hit me dead on the chin. I went down like a hot sack of potatoes, when I hit the ground, I looked forward just to see a car with a skeleton... wearing a black cloak. As I stood up, I grabbed a rock and turned towards him throwing a right hook and connecting hearing a solid crack sound come from my finger. I broke it again. The man didn't go down, I kicked his inner thigh and threw a straight connecting to his jaw once again. This time I knocked him out.

I went back in and paid my tab and then stepped back outside and waited for the man to wake up. When he did, I was there, pistol in hand, I had some questions, and I was going to get some answers. The way he stumbled it looked like he was a below the knee amputee, but that tattoo, I was just too interested. About ten minutes later he arose, jokes aside he woke up and I asked my questions. "What's with the tattoo on the arm?", the man simply responded, "I'm a pagan but that thing, that thing is terrifying, and I needed something to keep it away". "What thing?" I responded, he then said, "The thing that took my leg", I simply said afterward "What thing?" again... a moment of silence occurred before he said, "The Jersey devil". So, I told him "Follow me and tell me of any way to trap this thing in return I won't call the cops", and he did. While in my room he taught me a simple little trap, a devil's trap if you will. He claims the jersey devil is just a possessed child, lucky for me I can test his theory. I sent him off and thanked him. I gave him the last bit of my whisky as payment. I then attempted to sleep, but it was hard. I couldn't stop thinking about that man's tattoo and what happened to his leg.

I don't know when I nodded off, but I came to in a forest eye to eye... hole, with the skeleton in the cloak, he spoke in gargles gags pops and cracks, yet I understood him. Terrifying as it was, it almost soothing the way he spoke. What he said, in English, was "keep on killing I'm quite interested in you, a man who survived hanging." From that I awoke, I had been asleep for over a day. I went driving for the rest of the day and found the area in the forest where I had been in my dream, I knew this is where I needed to trap him. I called the exorcist that Father John told me about, he came to me in my motel room and knocked, seven times, waited a bit and knocked seven times, waited a bit again and then knocked seven more times, by that point I had gotten up and to the door and opened it. There was Father Chris, I let him in, and we developed a plan. It was easy to tell that he was not a big fan of me, but he believes that the plan we devised would work. He contacted all the exorcists in the area, and I contacted Father John who contacted all other priests to notify me if they hear or see anything. However, it was unexpected how quickly we got a response. The next morning, we were notified by Father Jamie that he had been tracking the thing so off me and Chris went. Chris was spray painting the sigil into the grass of the forest as I went to where the Jersey Devil had been tracked to.

When I arrived to where the thing was, I hopped out of my car and ran to it, I could hear its loud breathing. I threw a bit of holy water and the thing screeched something awful. The beast jumped into action and began chasing me, each time it got close I fired a round of holy water into the thing, honestly it worked way better than expected. The beast followed me but each shot at it would slow it down for just enough time for me to get a lead; when I arrived at my car, I threw more holy water onto the roof before hopping in. I was speeding over to Chris when the cops followed. Shit I was going to get busted for speeding... or was I. The beast rammed through the two cars, I stopped and fired two shots at the thing, and it looked at me... those demonic eyes stared straight into my soul... intense burning fury is all I could feel. The devil continued running towards me and I got back to driving. The thing shattered my windows with an ear bleeding screech. I turned around, scared like I had never been in my years of living so far, and fired two shots at the thing. I couldn't hear them, as I neared, I called Father Chris and yelled "I can't hear right now set off the flare if you're ready!" Sure, enough he was.

When I hopped out of my car I dropped to the ground. Without adrenaline I knew I wouldn't have gotten up. It really is a wonder drug. Anyways I stumbled to my feet and continued to run as I was, I yelled to Chris that I was stumbling. He came to my side and helped me. Each time the thing got close I fired two shots. I was stumbling too much and fell. I thought I was done for; I damn near pissed myself when Chris wrapped his arms from my backside around my chest and began dragging me like a soldier would drag a casualty.

We arrived at the spot, and I fired one last shot at the thing. Chris dropped me in the sigil, as the devil came towards us, I rolled forward as Chris pushed it. The thing fell over me and into the sigil. I then continued to roll out of the sigil and Chris helped me to my feet. I was passing out, before I was unconscious, I handed Chris my Glock and told him about the bullets.

When I awoke, I was in the church I had been in a few days before, I could hear again, and I was cleaned up. However, my car was still a mess and the key to my room was missing. I stepped out of the room and found Father John, he told me church was about to start and the least I could do was stay for mass. So, I did... oh god I hated it. As I left, I could hear the skeleton speak to me again, it told me "Continue on". It sent shivers down my spine.

It turns out my key had been returned to the motel, I swept out the glass of my car and took it to a repair shop. I was sleeping in a park as I waited for my car to be fixed. Father Chris and Jaime came up to me and offered me a room in the church, I got Jaime's number and left when my car was ready. Before left town I picked up some holy oil from Father John and went to the beast, I dumped a bunch of it onto the beast, I lit up my cigarette with my zippo and threw it onto the beast. As it screeched, I jumped into my car called the fire department and drove off. Once I could no longer hear the beast, I removed my earplugs just to hear its screeches die out... I knew the thing was dead.

On my way to the Niagra Falls I got a call, it was Agent Sword, the one who offered me my job. He praised me for killing the beast but warned me to stay low, they're removing my warrants from the database and clearing my records from the public; So, I'll be living out of my car for a bit...
