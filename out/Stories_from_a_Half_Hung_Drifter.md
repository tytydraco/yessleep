Continuing on from my last post I went up to Niagara Falls.

I drove up to Terrapin Point and parked my car and watched as the water fell; I was just relaxing on a bench when a young female came walking up to me, just by looking at her you could tell she was in her mid-twenties, she was of Asian descent, yet her hair was a platinum blonde and her eyes grey.

She sat on the bench beside me and said, "you're marked by death". I immediately stopped all that I was doing. I think she could see the awe, fear, and confusion in my eyes when I looked at her, she simply said "I was born beneath the veil. I see things a normal person cannot." I responded with "Soooooo you can see ghosts, demons, and otherworldly stuff like that?" A simple "Yes" was all I received. As she went to leave, I blurted out "Is there any way I can contact you again". As she walked away, she looked down at a phone, and did something. I felt a buzz in my pants and checked my phone to see a text saying, "We'll meet again when the time is right".

I stayed seated, smoking. I received a call about an hour later as I was getting up to leave. I was instructed by Agent Sword to pick up a female in NYC, her name is Kendra, I was told where her last location was, and that she was tracking down vampires. I then asked "Wait, why do you know her last location?" He responded dumbly "She asked we track her location"... I, simply put, said "what". I was told "shut the fuck up and go."

So, I began to drive, about 8 hours and no tolls later I arrived in NYC and had to pay 62 dollars to park for a few days. What is up with the north and expensive parking in cities.

Anyways, I began walking to a strip club; I can't believe I'm saying this, but I acted like a vampire, well to the best of my knowledge. I knocked on the door and asked to enter the premises. When I walked in, I requested a Bloody Mary... they laughed and took me to the back, as I walked, I could see some of the most beautiful women I could've ever dreamt of. Something was off though; I said they were beautiful, and I meant it, at the same time they hideous the eyes of one were like that of a dead fish and their teeth looked as if they were poking through the lips and tearing gums, their skin was pale and grotesque.

As I entered the back room a girl tied and beaten came up to headbutt me. I put my hand up and leaned back as she had swung, before she could pull back, I squeezed on both temples and spun behind her. I stuck my left index and middle finger down her rear pocket in an upside-down V shape, bulging like a men's wallet was in it, and kneed her in the ass pretty good.

I'm not bragging about hurting women, but I had to explain how I got her wallet; I couldn't let a sound out, who knows what the guys outside of here would do.

Anyways, after kneeing her it popped the wallet up into my fingers and I looked at the ID, Kendra Monica Smith was written upon it, I said "does the name Sword ring any bells?" her eyes widened with glee, I cut the rope and whispered in her ear that we gotta make a run for it, I slightly opened the door tying the rope around the outer handle and shut it. Then I used the chair Kendra was sat in to prop the door, after propping the door I tied the rope to the rearmost leg of the chair stabilizing the chair to the door making it a bit harder to force open. I shattered the window and Kendra leaped out cutting her leg on the broken glass thankfully I never removed the tape, too much attention would've been drawn to us had she whimpered. I could hear the door slowly edging closer and closer to open I broke off the rest of the glass before jumping out too.

Kendra was in pretty bad shape, so I picked her up in a bridal carry and ran to a densely populated area beside the street. I placed her on the ground and ripped off the Duct Tape that was still over her mouth and told her "Follow me we're going to my car", she yelled "No I need to get to a hospital". I responded, "Look I've gotta stay low and keep you safe, this isn't a question, come with me to my car". She stood up smacking away my gesture of a helping hand, afterwards she followed me as we speedwalked to my car; we didn't run, I couldn't risk her passing out. Once we arrived, I tore the leggings she had been wearing and disinfected and sutured the wound. I got her some good ole meat for her strength and some electrolyte drink for her blood loss and I IV'ed her with coconut water, just a bit not a lot. It got her back in action but not at a hundred percent.

When she was feeling better, she got out of the car as I was trying to get ahold Agent Sword. When I put the phone back in my I turned to see Kendra, she said, and I quote "I owe you a beating for earlier." She got the jump on me and knocked my ass out. When I woke, I was being dragged into my car, I could see the wound of the bites left by the vampires on Kendra's neck; the bastards kept biting the same spot. I reached up and touched Kendra right below the wound and said "Thats gonna scar up pretty nice". Kendra leaned over and smiled. She blurted out "You get back up pretty fast don't ya." I laughed and stood up, as I was exiting the car, I heard Kendra say, "So... Travis Masters, do you have a middle name." I turned around when she said that I knew she snatched my wallet as I did to her, I put my hand out and said, "I don't have a middle name, now can I get my wallet back."

Kendra and I got the car ready since nightfall was coming soon. We napped for a few hours... at least we tried. I awoke at midnight to find a note from Kendra. I will transcribe as much as I can remember below.

"Travis,

I'll be back. I'm going back to take those fuckers out. Removing their heads or a stake to the heart I don't care. They're going to pay.

I borrowed one of your machetes. I don't want you to get hurt so don't follow me.

I'll be back in the morning.

\- K"

This bitch, I got up and went into my trunk pulling my other machete out and headed back to the "strip club".

When I arrived, I kicked in the door and lost my lunch. I dropped to my hands and knees and hurled all I had ate recently. When I stood up, I got back into the fight, I ran in and took the head off of a vamp headed towards Kendra from her backside. From that we stood back-to-back.

I knew she could handle herself, when I walked in there were two vampires staked through the chest by one massive stake going into the wall. A body laid on the floor still wiggling with its head about a foot away. Another's head was smashed off of the body with a door, blood was covering the entire side of the it, Kendra had blood splattered on her face and body, her bag was on the ground beside her. She had the machete around the throat of a vampire, and she kicked him in the back removing his head. She really was a badass in her own right.

There were two vampires left, one in front of the each of us, Kendra had a female attacking her, I had a male. Kendra took its head off in one clean slice; I however didn't get the chance to. He threw me into a wall, literally into the wall, I broke through the drywall and studs before going into the crawlspace and hitting the bricks of the building. My machete was too far away, and the vampire was closing in, as I got out, I grabbed a piece of a stud and shattered the window, I grabbed the broken glass and shoved it through his throat, I rotated around him slicing away at the flesh before grabbing onto his chin while standing behind him and stepping on his feet. I was shaking with fear; I cranked down on his neck whilst standing upright quickly ripping his head off by disconnecting the vertebrae of the cervical spine and tearing the rest of the connected flesh.

Kendra changed as I washed up at the sink, I took some clothes that fit from the back, as I walked out, I could see Kendra puking. I guess I'm not the only weak stomach or fearful puker. I laughed and she said, "Fuck you I need a drink". I then asked, as she was putting on a hat, "Can I toss my clothes in your bag too, and you got another hat?" She tossed me one and threw my clothes into her bag. She pulled out a flashlight, at that moment another person walked in, I stood behind Kendra as she shined the light into the lady's eyes, I doubt she made out our faces, but she definitely saw the bodies. She screamed bloody murder and ran out.

I looked at Kendra and said, "We should probably get outta here", she said sarcastically "Nah". We then ran out side by side with Kendra shining the light in every camera visible. Once we got into my car, I started it up and we flew out of there.

As we were driving away, she asked "Why do you have two machetes." I responded, "Why don't you." She laughed, before she went to sleep, I asked, "What's your story what do you do?" She answered "My mother and father were murdered in front of my eyes by a creature of the night. So, I learned to fight and began killing any monsters I find, eventually Sword found me and gave me a job offer; so, I took it. Have you ever watched the TV show Supernatural?". I have and responded "Yea, so?" She said, "I guess I'm like Sam and Dean I look for a case take it and ride the lightning."

Kendra went to sleep, and I continued to drive, at the time I didn't know where I'd end up. I know I've had enough with the north, I just wanna go back down to the south.

I called Agent Sword and he finally answered, the first thing I said is "I got K out of there. You want me to stick with her for a bit huh." Sword responded "You knew I was gonna ask didn't you. Stay with her, you two would be a good team." I ended the conversation by saying "We are", then hung up.
