Sorry this post has taken so long to post. Me and K have been going through a lot, but I don't want to talk about it now, I intend to keep up with the chronology as I stated before; I will be soon though...

&#x200B;

Have you ever heard of The Voodoo Queen, Marie Laveau. Yes Laveau, L A V E A U for those who've never been to the south just search it up.

I wish to welcome myself back, I let K do the last post, I didn't expect what I read... anyways I've been contemplating about posting this story, I want to keep everything true and explain each big story. On our way down to Louisiana we found a few possessions and demonic attachments that were solved within a day by calling up a few priests that would get ahold of the nearest exorcists to our location where they'd perform the rites of exorcism. Like I said, each of those experiences were tiny so I've decided not to post them. This story however I didn't want to post, I wanted to post all of my successful missions... cases... whatever you want to call it. However K told me to be honest with you all. Maybe one day I'll explain the smaller stories between my last post and this, I don't know.

With that said I'll begin with what occurred within the French quarter.

&#x200B;

We arrived in Louisiana and decided to stop in a hotel for once. Unlike the usual we found something let's settle down for a bit and deal with it, instead K got a call from another Agent, one of an equivalent rank as Sword. K had picked up the phone "Hello?" By the way she answered it was clear she didn't have the number saved, she put it on speaker and I could hear the voice through the line begin to speak, "Hey, is this K?" She answered, "This is. Whom am I speaking to?" The man began again "This is Joseph Rivera, you can call me Joe, I'm in the same position as Sword, he told me you and Masters were going south and I saw the tracker placed on your persons that y'all are currently in my jurisdiction now. Sword works the Northeastern Jurisdiction, I run the Midwest Jurisdiction. I've had report after report of above average anomalous sightings in New Orleans, I've already got a hotel for y'all, the room you'll be staying in is yours until the assignment is completed. I'll send you the location, just find out what is going on. Also give my contact to Masters, Joe out."

The way he spoke was far more serious than Sword, it honestly made me a little nervous. Was he scared... should I have been more scared than I was, or was that just how he was?

When we arrived at the hotel we received the key to the room and were instructed where to go, tenth story room 1005. When we walked in and was amazed we had a suite, I then looked and found a mini fridge and bar that had notes on each stating anything we want will be paid by the company renting the room for us. I'm not proud to say this but I read the note aloud when K asked what I was looking at, she began to hop in place and I decided to join her, she popped open a nice bottle of champagne and we began to drink. By the end of the night we had drunk a couple of bottles of champagne and I opened a bottle of scotch.

The next morning we were startled awake by a banging on the door. I got up and partially opened the door, I left the chain on it so it caught. Behind it my pistol was aimed towards center mass. He asked "Are you Travis? is K in?" I said "Maybe, who are you?". "Joe asked me to come here too, I'm in the room next to y'all, my name is Rick, I was instructed to assist y'all." I closed the door, disconnected the chain and reopened the door to let him in, when he entered he immediately covered his eyes and asked K to put on some clothes; it's something she's been doing since I met her, if we're not sleeping in my car she'll sleep in only a bra and panties. While he was covering his eyes I pulled out my phone and scanned the massive QR code patch on the back of his ratty black denim jacket. It immediately hopped onto youtube playing a rick roll... this SOB got me. He turned around, slapped me and said "Be ready in 10 minutes, I'm grabbing my weapons I'll be right back", when I said he slapped me I'm not talking about a light smack to the back, I'm talking about an actual slap to the fucking face. I looked at K after he left, she was trying to hide a snorting laugh, I was kinda pissed off. "This bitch", is all I could get out before grabbing my pistol, I chose to use my Security-9 instead of my Glock 42, more bullets per mag and more piercing power may be helpful. I then grabbed a knife and put it into my boot. As I came back upright There was a knock at the door. I looked at K to see that she was dressed, so I opened the door and Rick came in asking if we were ready to go.

I really didn't think too well of him, he's clearly cocky and sees himself as the hero of his own story.

Anyways I ask if he's gonna be driving with us following or if he wants us to ride in his car, he looks me dead in the eyes and says "I don't have a car, I ride trains, and walk. Sometimes I'll hitch hike. Like I have a license, but no car."

So the three of us hopped into my car K and Rick bickering the entire way down about who should sit in the front. When we get to the car I get in and start it before rolling the window down and yelling "K get in the front Rick get in the back, y'all have 5 seconds or I'm driving off without you." They quickly hopped in as I began to drive with Rick fighting his way inside the moving car. We went to the nearest Waffle House to eat, when arriving we discuss what's been going on, there's been a spike of sighting of the voodoo queen, the dead returning to life and walking the world of man and flying pigs... yes flying pigs; I was, and still am, caught off guard on the fact that there were flying pigs. There was also a sighting of a man in strange clothes at the scene each time.

Rick had noted the most commented on feature of his clothes, a black trench coat with a hood and some type of symbols that covered the entire backside, right on cue we saw a man wearing the jacket Rick was just speaking about; Both he and K went running out after him sticking me with the bill.

By the time I finished eating and stepped outside, I could see their tracks.I followed them, eventually I found the two stumbling back on the same route they went, and my god did they stink, Rick looked awful with cuts all over his face and arms. I asked what happened, K explained "We were chasing the man when he went into the wooded area out back, we went in after the man when he said something, it sounded like latin. Afterwards a bunch of skunks appeared as if from thin air spraying us and they mauled Rick pretty good. While they were Attacking him I followed the tracks left by the man we were chasing, but his tracks vanished. I heard a few shots fired so I ran back to see Rick killed the skunks. We decided to head back after I told Rick that the man's tracks disappeared." I tried to stifle a laugh as I told them to follow me back to the car. Rick was happy that I let him sit in the front seat, once seated K handed me my first aid kit. I patched up Rick and we went back to the hotel.

While we were all in mine and K's room she was google dorking to get into the camera's in the area I sat down with Rick and asked "What'd you do before you got this job?", he began speaking "I was a cop, I got fired for messing up two different stings. Somehow I confused two different drug dealers on where to go. I came to the spot we set up to buy the load; when I arrived both me and the dealer, or who I thought was the dealer, stepped out. He said I've got the money, I responded no I've got the money, I again said no I have the money, and responded no you'll have the money when I get the drugs, he said no I'll have the drugs when I get you the money. I arrested him anyway and called my sergeant. I then got scolded pretty good before being instructed to return to the station with the criminal. It turns out the other officer that was performing the sting got injured arresting the other dealer. What occurred was basically what happened to me but with the drugs. When I went to my sergeants office he then chewed me out and then I had to go to our captain to get cussed out before he ended up firing me. Joe found me after I left and offered me a job within the BPI"

This S.O.B. is stupid as hell, anyways. "The BPI?" I asked... Rick looked at me and said "Wait you didn't know who you were working for? The BPI is the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation. You, Kendra, and I are a part of the Hunter unit. You have the Hunter unit where we have to kill anything that makes itself known by performing vile acts. Usually a monster won't make itself known unless it's killing. You also have the Research unit who... well the name explains it all. You have the politics unit which makes treaties with monsters, and the containment unit who works directly with both the politics and research units. You also have the worker unit which runs the areas we have set up such as the research labs and monster towns. There's also the special units which you will not know anything about unless you join in and finally you have the security unit. Whenever the organization wants to do something the main units head members, the highest ranks of each unit, have to vote, whichever vote is the highest is what the bureau would do. The main units being the hunter, research, politics, worker, and security units."

K stopped what she was doing to join into the conversation, "Yea I remember Sword telling me about that, I had been in for almost a year before they tested my threat grade, I'm a B9." Rick solemnly spoke back, "I'm a D1." They then looked at me and I said "I don't know what grade I am, I've never been graded." That's when Rick began speaking again, "The grades go as follows you have the standard grades being A through E, the closer to A the bigger of a threat you are to whatever or whoever your going after, the number is how close you are to a next grade, so a E1 is almost as big of a threat as a D9. You then have special grades which surpass A1, special grades go as follows, Special Grade 1 through 9, Special grade 9, or just SG9 as most commonly said, is Just barely considered more of a threat or equal to the threat of an A1. The only way to become a SG is to either be considered to be able to obliterate an A1 or to be entered into the special units. They grade you off of physical fitness, your ancestry, blessing, or if you have connections to some deity or entity, divine or demonic and anything between."

Before anything else could be said an alarm on K's laptop went off and she exclaimed "OH SHIT, ALREADY!?!? The man has been sighted, he's in a voodoo shop about 3 miles down the road. Y'all ready or what?"

Rick was the first one up, "I've got a score to settle..."

So we all go back to the car and Rick wouldn't accept being a backseater, oh no no no. He evolved into a passenger princess. We drove down to where he was at, when he saw us he ran, K told us to chase him and that she'll catch up. Rick and I hopped out and began chasing after him as she drove away. We were on foot now. We ran for a while before finding him hopping into a kayak. I looked at my phone and found a kayak vender, we ran to him and paid for a rental kayak and texted K that we would be chasing him on the water. We rowed and rowed following him to a little hill above a dark swamp. By that point night had fallen and we were left in the dark. The next thing I had was a wet thwak sound. I turned to see Rick on the ground and the man looking at me, I shiver ran down my spine. "You've got to be fucking kidding..." I didn't get to finish speaking before I got hit, I tried pulling my weapon out before that, but it snagged on my shirt.

&#x200B;

When I awoke everything was black; I was shaking, I'm not sure if it was fear or the fact it was cold... probably a bit of both.

I could hear steps coming to me, but what was it. I tried moving but at that moment I realized I was tied up, when I went to speak I could feel the duct tap covering my mouth. The next thing I knew I got hit pretty hard, then again, and again. Shit I thought, "He's gonna beat me to death isn't he, he wants to do it himself, he's gonna enjoy each punch. This sadistic fucker was gonna drag this shit out."

While being wailed on, a blindfold fell off and I could see him, as I figured it was the man me and Rick were racing after. I asked why are you doing this, he smiled a wicked grin before saying "Well my boss is paying me to capture the spirit of someone specific." When I went to speak he backhanded me and continued, "I'm speaking right now. DO NOT INTERRUPT! Now as I was saying before being so rudely interrupted, I've been working on a massive set of spells to revive it, I won't tell you who. All you need to know is that I will get what my boss wants. Now, with that said, why is someone connected to death chasing after me? What is it? Do you want my soul, or maybe you owe him a favor... You better think of a good way to explain it to me when I get back." Before leaving he said something along the lines of "Crimen enim sue memoria proteritorum referet et ant oculos micate."

As he left I could see my past swirling around me. I could see the good and bad things I've done. I could see the lives of family and friends fade away in my hands. I could see those I've killed drop to the ground, while I could see others I just hurt or tortured.

Eventually the man came back laughing before walking through the swirling memories. He grabbed me by the shoulders and got real close before saying "How's the past two days been? I can smell the shit in your pants, spells are quite tricky aren't they? You know what to do yet you cannot, terrifying isn't it." He then left before repeating the same spell again and it started over beginning again. I must admit he's right. In a normal case I'd drop back to break my chair and get up but I couldn't. Eventually I began to see things that were out of the norm, things I'd began to forget. My father having life threatening injury after injury yet surviving. Eventually the man came back and he spoke in an impressed voice "You've been here for over a week, I'm surprised you've survived this long. Now as I asked before, why are you following me!" Before I could answer K and rick busted in and I could see them through my swirling memories. Rick fired his weapon, one shot is all that was needed. The shot took two of his fingers and broke his concentration. Finally the spell had broke. Black smoke tunneled out and covered him before dissipating. He was gone.

K came up to me, "You reek, let's get you to a shower. When we get back don't freak out either." I asked "Why?" She answered, "All of your hair is white." Rick and her cut me free before Rick handed me back my phone, now charged, and my knife and gun. As we walked to K told me, "Wait here with Rick, I'm going to go to a dollar general to get trash bags and get you some new clothes. As some baby wipes; you will not be sitting in the car all nasty like that."

As she left I looked to Rick who was slowly pulling out a pack of cigarettes, "Yo can I bum one?" I asked, he handed me one while nodding. After he lit his he lit mine and we waited.

&#x200B;

When K finally got back I went back inside before cleaning myself with the wipes and putting the new set of clothes on, she forgot my underwear. I then walked back out as clean as I could be freeballing in a new set of clothes. By the time we arrived at the hotel everything that happened between when me and Rick got dropped and when they picked me up. Anyways it was night when arriving and K and i went into our room and Rick went into his. I started my nasty laundry, and began showering. While in the shower the voice of the skeleton came back to me, "You really let him beat you? Get your payback." After I finished my shower I looked in the mirror and saw my white hair, by this point it was sitting right below my shoulders. I then stopped focusing on my hair, I saw the skeleton standing behind me. When I turned around he wasn't there. I went to bed but I just couldn't sleep, and when I did I woke up shortly after horrific nightmares of my past. For days we had no signs of the man and began stepping out to any witchcraft and psychic shops informing them that if this man is seen to call over to one of our three phones. Over that time I still couldn't sleep.

It ended up being another two weeks before we got a call, I was finally going to get him back.

We went to the woman who called us, a psychic, and she said we'd have to pay for a reading for any information she had. So I pulled out a 20 dollar bill and sat in the chair, she began moving her hands around a crystal ball and you could see the entire thing turn black. She looked puzzled before grabbing a deck of tarot cards, she shuffled them and placed down five cards of death, she then looked at her deck to see that they were all the cards of death. I stood before K sat, we asked the lady to retry, after shuffling her deck of cards she put out cards other than the card of death. Rick looked me in the eye's and said, "What in the actual fuck?" I shrugged, honestly shaken by the experience, before looking at the lady. She began "The man y'all spoke to me about has been meditating at the shrine of Marie Laveau and had been there for a few days, she then told us where we could find it.

We drove to it to find the man there meditating. When I hopped out he opened his eyes and looked at me before saying he'll meet me at the Voodoo Queen's ritual grounds. He then vanished as he had the last time we saw him. I looked at K before asking, "Do you know who the Voodoo Queen is?" She shook her head no before a bystander who witnessed the event spoke up "You're at her shrine." "So do you know where the ritual grounds are?", I responded. The man gulped and told me how to get to them.

The three of us got back into the car and went back to the Kayak rental shop, he asked where we were going, so we answered and he explained we would want weapons to go out there, "it's infested with large alligators. I can't in good conscience rent out a kayak to you if you're going there without a shotgun at least. Prove to me that you are and you'll be rented one."

I headed outside and pulled a shotgun from my trunk, when I turned around I could see the dead alligators and bodies left in the swamp rising and coming out of the water, I loaded the shotgun as quick as possible and inserted my extra shells into the holder; as I was running back inside I could see that everyone inside was getting beginning to barricade the wall, they were tearing the shelves from the walls and stacking them up in front of the store's doors. As I entered I threw 100 bucks, the price to rent the kayak for the rest of the day, and I said "Shit he's doing something again, If I get him to leave the spell should go out. It did when he cast one on me." I opened the door before they slid the shelving back behind me as I walked out an alligator came towards, you could see its ribs exposed and maggots eating at the bad flesh. As it neared a place the tip of the shotgun right above its mouth before pulling the trigger blowing off its mouth. I then pushed the shelf holding three kayaks in front of the doors and took the top one. I ran to the water and dropped the kayak in before hopping in.

As I seated myself I began rowing out into the water, I could see both zombified and normal alligators circling me. As I continued rowing they began to back away. When I arrived to the ritual grounds it was getting beginning to get dark. Not even a few steps in I puked a black, thick liquid. It felt like something had punched me directly on my stomach itself.

After hurling I came upright I saw the man and exclaimed, "Hey Two-Fingers, what are you doing?"

He turned to me with a puzzled look, "D- Did you just call me Two-Fingers?", After saying that he looked down to his two missing fingers before looking back and saying "You motherfucker".

He then continued on with what he was doing. He finished carving into the ground something that looked like a magic symbol and he began chanting. The carving began to glow and you could see a partially transparent woman flying towards us.

When she arrived I could see her getting pulled into a wooden box with a crystal and a gum gum ball covered in wax.

That's when the flying pig hit the dude breaking his chanting; the glowing stopped and the woman who was getting sucked into the box was released.

I yelled out to the man, "Bro get rid of that pig, why do you keep bringing him around, it's been spotted around you multiple times!" He turned to me before replying, "It's not mine, it has been following me since I got here."

Weird...

Before I could say anything else the spirit flew towards them through me, it knocked me to my ass. It honestly kinda hurt, I heard the man begin going off, "Shit, shit, shit, we're surrounded, This pig is annoying, and we have a pissed off Marie... got any ideas?"

I stood up as Two-Fingers stepped behind me, back to back, we began fighting off everything coming after us. I pulled my pistol out and shot the wings off the pig. The zombified alligators went running to it. I saw a light as Two-Fingers brought his hands up and said something.

"Heads up", I called out as the both of us dropped down. I continued, "Why are all of these things coming back from the dead?"

"My spell brings the dead back until I get the one I'm going after. I need to complete it", responded Two-Fingers.

I retorted, "Well can't you shut it down? I know when you left me that spell you did on me went out."

"I need to get her, I need the money for my sister. I'll get enough for her treatment if I capture the spirit of the Voodoo Queen!" Was his comeback to what I had said before.

At that he restarted the spell he had been chanting a moment ago.

I took out my knife, pistol still in hand. I began shoot and remove the water filled human zombie heads.

After I took out all of the human zombies I started blowing holes in the zombified alligators eating at the now dead pig.

They all stopped, but I hadn't killed them all. I turned around to see Two-Fingers walking up to the wooden box... that son of a bitch went through with his spell.

This time I was pissed, he could've quit the spell, maybe I should've told him about my work. I, however, doubt he would have listened.

I walked up to him, no I ran up to him, I got into a stance to fight. "Really, you want to do this, we're done, I completed the spell, nothing else needs to happ-", I didn't let Two-Fingers finish before I decked him with a Jab. I leaned to my side before he threw a pathetic excuse of a punch, when I came upright I followed through with a hook, I did it again, and again, and again. I could feel each hook get heavier and heavier. Before I knew it I was no longer in control. I kept beating Him moving around to punch a rib, or a temple, the kidneys, when I hit him in the liver he dropped to the ground. I kicked him hard in the gut before stomping on his face. Each time he would try to pull his little black smoke disappearing trick I'd rip him out of the smoke before he could voodoo away. It felt as if someone else was controlling me... like someone had a controller to my body, it honestly kinda freaked me out to say the least.

As I continued kicking the crap out of him I could see the day was beginning to set and a dark cloud began to form over where I was. I heard K’s voice call out to me, "Travis, what the hell are you doing?" When I turned I saw K, Rick and someone else. Rick out of the three of them was the one who I thought would be fine seeing the mess I left this man in. I was wrong even he had a clear gut wrenching reaction, I could hear K begin to yell once again, "What the fuck did you do? Why are your eyes purple, what the hell man." Before I could say anything an overcoming urge came over me and a voice I hadn't heard in a way spoke to me crackling and popping, "Let me..." Before I let it finished, I said, "Get out of my head, I am in control." K and Rick looked puzzled, but the third one walked up to me. "I'm Joe it's nice to finally meet, I need you to breathe and calm down", he said. After he spoke, I replied, "Wait why are you here, we didn't call you and nothing really needs to be done about this." "That's not why I'm here", he said "Look something you and K had called in has started a whole investigation. They're calling it Project Insect Adam; they want the three of you in it. Not only that they want you to get graded, Travis..., from what it looks like you're a special grade... I hope I'm wrong."

That last sentence puzzled me, a shiver ran down my spine when I heard it. "Shit not this again", yelled K pointing at where the body of Two-Fingers had been, there was a dark smoke dissipating at that point.

&#x200B;

When I turned back to Joe he shrugged, "So when do we get this party started?" I asked. I could feel myself grinning from ear to ear, I'm not sure if it was caused by fear or excitement but I could feel the adrenaline running through my veins as my grin grew.
