Hi Reddit, this is my first ever post. I’m not sure what had me turn to social media as I’m not usually very present on it but I don’t think going to the police will yield any results. 

Let me explain, I haven’t heard from a close friend of mine in about a week. Not all that odd, I know but we were supposed to meet up at the weekend and I haven’t heard from him at all. No text, no call, absolutely nothing. 

Rowan (the guy this post is about) gave me a key to his place in case of emergency, or for whenever he may need someone to feed his cat. So I caved and went round about 3 days into him being MIA. Just to make sure everything was okay. 

I didn’t find him. His keys, shoes coat, everything is still in the flat. His bed isn’t made and the strangest thing? His phone is in the middle of the floor covered in dirt with a cracked screen. I know his password so I stuck it on charge and decided to do a little snooping, hoping to get some indication to what might have happened. 

Now what’s on the phone is something that I definitely didn’t expect. There are accounts written by rowan about what has been happening and it’s so fantastical that I don’t know what to believe but my friend is missing and I need help. 

If this story he has written rings any bells for anyone else, if they know what this means or what this ‘place’ is please help. 

I’ll be uploading this in parts due to the size. 

For anyone worried about the cat, he is fine. Managed to get into his dry food and has been gorging himself on that for past few days. I’ve opted to stay at my friend's house to look after him and I’m hoping Rowan comes back here. 
 




Something isn't right, I don't feel safe. There's something here that shouldn't be. 

Fragmented thoughts floated aimlessly between my ears, an unsteady flow of barely conscious thought as I roused from my slumber. I don't know what woke me. I’m usually a heavy sleeper but something was deeply wrong, I could feel it. I slowly filtered back into existence in dribs and drabs. My hand brushing the bedside table in search of my phone, I reached across further, fingers never finding their target. Feeling almost drunk I blindly fumbled in the dark, refusing to open my eyes and allowing the calm of sleep to leave me completely. I pulled in a deep breath and as I did so my nose scrunched in retaliation to the strong smell permeating the air around me, the scent thick with mud and pinewood. I shifted in my bed, retracting my hand and opting to try and ignore it in the hopes of drifting back off. I willed the sense of unease to dissipate. As I lay there I noticed that an almost dewy texture coated the back of my throat as I breathed in and it filled the space around the bed, leaving my duvet ever so slightly damp. Curiosity getting the better of me, my eyes drifted open hesitantly, hoping to see nothing and to attribute the strange senses to an incredibly vivid dream but when my vision adjusted to the darkness of the room, my eyes zeroed on my bedroom door. The dim flickering of the nearby lamppost outside casting a low yellow tint through my thin curtains, illuminating in short intervals the bedroom door, what had me pause however was the now splintered frame. I leaned forward, squinting my eyes for a clearer view. A frown pulled at the corner of my lips as I noticed a thin layer of green mould creeping up the wood. Tufts of leaves and vines entangled in the hinges, along the side and peaking out from under the door. 

I rubbed at my eyes for a few moments before falling back onto the bed with a soft thud. There was no way this was real. I was having a weird ass lucid dream and all I needed to do now was either embrace the odd experience or ignore it completely. 

I couldn't ignore it. 

I scrunched my eyes up in defiance. All I needed to do was wake up, for real this time. As cliche as it sounds I felt the need to pinch myself. The dull pinch of flesh between finger yielded no results and I found myself regretfully sitting back up in bed to stare at the door once more, only this time my attention was drawn elsewhere, to the left of me is another doorway leading to my en suite bathroom. Something I know to be true about myself is that I never leave my doors open when going to sleep. Something about staring into the inky abyss of a pitch black room unsettles me. 

If you stare long enough it stares back right? 

My eyes trailed across the room to the now open doorway, which immediately set alarm bells off in my head. What I definitely didn't expect however was to catch a slight shift in the darkness. Something had moved. 

Feeling my adrenaline spike, the breath catching in my throat I gripped the bed covers. Sitting ramrod straight, entire body stiff as a board. 

Before I had a chance to react further the sound of laboured breathing reached my ears, it was quiet but I could still hear it. Whatever it was realised that I had noticed its presence and the breathing began to pick up in what seemed like excitement and anticipation, as if on the precipice of a giggle. I had to do something, I couldn't just sit here and wait for this intruder or… thing, to kill me. 

My hands found my bedslide lamp, I wrenched it toward me, dislodging the plug. The sound of it hitting the side of the bed with a soft thump had the breathing coming from my doorway stop. 

“Ro-wan… Rowan… darling it's me. it’s Mummy” The words came out in a mixture of low and high tones, as if it was trying to find the right pitch. 

Ice ran down my spine. Sweat began to bead on the back of my neck and every hair on my body was standing upright. 

How the fuck does it know my name? 

Whoever or whatever this was was definitely missing a trick here, my mother was dead. Died during childbirth. There was no way in hell that whatever was standing there was her. Without any further hesitation I lobbed the lamp directly at the doorway. Not waiting to find out if it had made an impact I leapt from the bed. When my feet met the ground, I noticed that the floor was no longer glossed wooden floorboard but wet grass that curled around my bare feet. 

My chest heaving unsteadily, I ran toward my bedroom door. I didn't know what else to do. Didn't have time to weigh my options. I felt the cold bite of the door handle against my finger, in my haste to exit the door flung open and I fell through. I blindly held my arms out to soften the fall. 

What I didn't expect was to fall directly into what seemed to be a damp forest floor, not expecting the wet terrain, I was unable to adjust to the situation and found myself slipping sideways. I scrambled to find a purchase. My head whipping around to look back at the way I came.. 

My heart was cracking against my ribcage. No amount of air satiated my depraved lungs. The panic and confusion I felt was coursing through my veins and setting every nerve ablaze.

And then my eyes found hers. 

She stared at me from the doorway, hate swirling in her pupils. I watched her mouth stretch into a wide smile, lips cracking, allowing thin streams of blood to lazily slide down her chin. 

She said nothing. 

The door swung shut on its own and the moment it made impact with the frame I watched helplessly as the entire thing fell to the forest floor. 

—————————————————————————————


The air was thick with fog; it coated my lungs and threatened to choke me as I ran, feet taking me as fast as I could go without tripping on the uneven surface, the foreign terrain felt like it did everything in its power to fight against my wild attempts at running through the foliage, I winced as the harsh tug of the branches snagged on my clothes, biting into my skin, reminding me that this was real. The oppressive nature of this place settled deep within my bones mere seconds after finding myself stuck in it. I had no idea where I was going, all I wanted was to be back in my bed, fast asleep. 

This of course was now an impossibility considering I had watched in utter 
devastation as the way that I came in fell flat against the drenched grass, I could still feel the sting of the tips of my fingers as they dug frantically into the vines that curled around the doors frame. Watching helplessly, eyes blown wide in shock and panic as it was consumed by the forest floor. 

The hellscape before me was cast in a hue of sickly green, beams of unnatural light breaking through the treetops, doing little to ease the darkness that was closing in around me. My mind had been racing, a cacophony of thoughts bounced around my skull making it hard to think. I wanted so desperately to look back but fear had gripped me like a vice and I could feel the clench of its icy fingers gripping my heart and squeezing until I felt as though it would pop.  

I should never have gone through that fucking door, but then again… what choice did I have?. 

How was it even possible? To be standing in a forest, surrounded by twisting trees that climbed up desperately to claw at the night sky when not even twenty minutes prior I had been in my bed, asleep. I felt the tears sliding down my face in quick succession but I didn't stop running. Twigs and rocks dug into the bottom of my feet as they pelted against the uneven surface, a mix of rain, blood and mud causing leaves to stick to the underside of my exposed flesh.

I could feel the bitter night air whipping past my face, it carried a chorus of unrecognisable sounds past my ears. Not knowing where to go, my eyes searched the space around me, the ever present need to look behind me, had me craning my head round at an awkward angle. The surrounding area was painted in inky black and green. In my frantic daze I hadn't even realised that something was running at me, in fact I hadn't realised it until a large hard mass careened into my side and both me and the unknown object slid through the mud of the forest floor and landed in a crumpled heap of limbs. During my ungraceful descent, my ankle rolled and as my arms flailed in a weak attempt to catch myself the unforgiving bark of the tree sliced across my skin. The back of my head cracking with a sickening thud against another trunk. Feeling dazed and winded, It had taken longer than I am proud of to pull myself up off the wet ground. 


A harsh gasp broke the silence and my whole body jerked, jarring the new injury that dripped sluggishly down the back of my neck. My eyes landed on a girl, she seemed to be about the same age as me. Roughly in her 20’s. Her long curls were drenched in sweat, the fear was rolling off of her in waves, causing my own anxiety to peak. I released a shuddering breath and pressed a shaky hand to the back of my head. The warmth of the blood making me cringe at the contact. Focusing through my pain-filled haze I noted that the girl seemed to be injured, even in the low light I could see that her blue jeans were torn at the knees, bloodied and battered from the fall. She was scrambling to pull herself up from the unforgiving grip of the thick mud beneath us, her breathing coming out with a high pitched wheeze, one of her hands reached up to cradle her potentially bruised or cracked ribs as she began to kick out hard against the forest floor in a desperate attempt to stand, due to the overly saturated ground the loose mud shifted under her unsteady footing and I watched as she fell back down with a thud, a frustrated cry leaving her cracked lips, the anguished sound echoing around the space between us.   

“Get the fuck away from me” she spat, her crazed eyes never leaving me as she managed to pull herself off the ground. She held herself in an unsteady gait, favouring her left side. 

I held out my hands in a placating manner and slowly stood.

“I'm not going to hurt you. Please, do you know what's going on?” the words left my throat in a strained whisper. The girl had started to shake her head frantically as she backed up a few more steps. There was a hesitation in her movements, she was scared, she didn't want to go back the way she came. Something was after her. Dread bubbled up from the pit of my stomach as I glanced behind the stranger. The night air was still, I listened with baited breath. There was a faint shuffling sound coming from somewhere in the distance, my concentration however was broken when the girl began to speak. 

“I don't trust you, what if if you-” 

Her next few words were cut off as something lurched from the bush behind her, the fog was thick, it encased everything around us in a fuzzy haze, making the unfamiliar territory even more confusing to navigate, the glow of the unnatural moon that sat crookedly in the sky blanketed our features giving us an otherworldly glow.  

I heard it before I saw it. 

I don't think I'll ever forget the sound.  

The first thing I heard was the cracking and popping, the sound reminding me with sickening clarity of when I had fallen off my bunk bed when I was 12, arm smacking against the chest of draws and the subsequent crack that reverberated off my bedroom walls. As the unidentifiable figure dragged its misshapen silhouette closer the squelching of the sodden mud sounded deafening in the otherwise silent space. In the dimly lit environment I couldn't fathom what I was looking at, the thing before me had no discernible shape as it lurched toward us. The crunching of what sounded like shattered glass rubbing against the underside of someone's shoe accompanied its movements. Neither I or the girl spoke a word but the thing behind her was emitting a low rumbling akin to a car engine. I felt my body take an instinctive step back. It was then that the figure had stopped, standing in a rare beam of fairly bright moonlight that shone through a larger gap in the treetop. 

I wish that it hadn't. 

The green glow of the night sky danced across twisted features as the figure took its momentary pause on its journey, almost revelling in the horrified stares of its prey. My eyes trailed to its face first, it had a feminine appearance, long dark hair was matted against its forehead, dried blood and deep bruising adorning her features. Two large pieces of glass protruded from the side of her head, digging unforgivingly into her temples. my eyes tracked the dark thick blood that sluggishly oozed down its face and started to gather and congeal around a large metal object sticking out of the side of her neck, her mangled and infected skin puckered and angry around the intrusion. At first I couldn't make out what the foreign object was, but as the smell of petrol assaulted my nose and my eyes fixed on the dark smoke that billowed out of it, I realised that it was an exhaust pipe that she was seemingly using to breathe through. My eyes tracked lower and continued to take in the nightmare before me. 

Her entire left side concave, the skin hanging in ribbons around muscle and bone. part of a steering wheel was protruding out of her chest, the metal and rubber welded there, her skin a mixture of burns and blisters that were leaking creamy yellow puss, the acrid burn of bile rose to the back of my throat. She stumbled towards us unsteadily, her foot catching on something hanging from her stomach which I realised to my horror was her intestines spilling out onto the floor and dragging behind her. 

There was a low mumbling coming from its direction, every agonising step it took, the bones popping in and out of place, its joints groaning at the strain of being upright was accompanied by the same five words repeated like a mantra. 

“I don't want to die” 

They came out in a garbled whisper, choking on its own blood as it seeped down its chin and landed with an audible splat on the ground. 

Every aborted move she made had the bones in her hip grind together as she crept closer. I couldn't comprehend what I was seeing, she looked like a walking corpse. Those of her organs that weren't trailing behind her had been utterly pulverised, her right side was painted in a deep blue and purple tint. The heavy bruising yellowing around the edges. The entire time she crept closer she never stopped muttering those words. 

I felt something move to the left of me, the girl who had been standing in front of me had whipped around at the new arrival and although not much closer to me had backed up and was staring straight at the figure bathed in green light, her eyes blown wide as they took in the features of the mangled corpse. 

For a very brief moment no one moved, the air heavy with dread. 

The girl next to me said nothing but was shaking her head minutely, her breath coming out in stuttered gasps, releasing frantic puffs of cold air that curled around her face before dissipating into the night. The thing before us was looking at her with some form of recognition.

 I felt as though my feet had been welded to the ground below me, I had no idea what to do or what was happening. So I continued to stand ramrod straight, the groan of my body protesting the strain of being stiff with fear, my eyes flickering between the two. 

“I don't want to die,” it repeated.

The girl next to me inhaled sharply and brought her hands up to her ears, she dug her fingernails into the side of her head and squeezed her eyes shut.

“SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP” she wailed, chest moving wildly in and out as she took greedy gulps of air. 

The girl's words were fast and frantic. The grip around her ears tightening and drawing blood. 

The thing that stood before us had started to giggle. The sound of it sent a burning hot jolt of fear racing down my spine. The sound came out deeper than it should have, caught in her throat as blood bubbled up past her parted lips.


“I can smell your rotten soul” the creature snarled before reaching up and began to pull at the piece of glass protruding from her temple, I watched as it slipped free from her skin and dug into her fingers as the grip around the object tightened. Her eyes flicked over to meet mine for a brief moment before cutting back to the girl, its lips curled up into an unnatural smile. 


“Oh Laura, look what you turned me into” a pause 


“You’ll lay with the maggots, just like me” 


Something that I found out about myself very quickly Is that when faced with imminent danger, I completely freeze.
I don't know if it was due to being concussed or being thrown into something entirely impossible.


But I. Could. Not. Move.  


“Please, Ellie I-“ My eyes landed on the girl once more, her words punctured by guttural sobs. Hands still planted firmly over each ear, nails digging into her pale skin. 

In the very next instant she stopped. The tears silently cascading down her cheeks but not a sound was made, a confused look passed over her face, hand coming to rest on her lower abdomen. I watched on with baited breath. 


 My whole body began to shake, my knees feeling weak as they struggled to keep me upright. Every instinct in me told me to run at that moment but the fear kept me glued to the spot, my eyes trained on the girl beside me who grabbed the hem of her shirt and hiked it up frantically to look down at her stomach. We both gasped when something began to swell there, a hard mass pushing against her skin. she clutched at the bulbous growth in disbelief and then hunched over in pain, a harsh cry tearing from her lips. 

From her now crouched position she called out to me through clenched teeth. 

“Please, help me. Get it out!” 

She fell to her knees, gripping the dirt beneath her as her stomach expanded even more. A puddle of blood gathered at her feet. 

I couldn't breathe, my heart beating frantically against my rib cage as I watched the girl before me writhe in pain, her back arched as she fell to the floor. She wailed as I watched her stomach begin to swell to an impossible size, the skin stretched and contorted around the foreign mass, the outline of hands pushing up against her flesh made bile rise to the back of my throat, for the second time tonight, I swallowed it back down, willing my legs to move… to do…  something. I found myself stumbling over to her, the forest floor raced up to meet me,  knees burning from the impact. My hands hovered uselessly above her, unsure how to help. 


The creature who had been, up until this point, watching on in quiet contentment appeared behind me. I felt her cold dead lips press up against the shell of my ear as Icy fingers ran down my arm. The stench of death catching in my throat. 

“Her time is up. Gonna have to cut her open, to let it out” it whispered. 


I felt myself being flung backwards by unnatural strength, the impact of the tree trunk colliding with my back stealing the air from my lungs. 

A continuous soundscape of pain and terror permeated the air around us. I could hear the strain of Laura’s vocal cords, as the thing within her pushed against her flesh once again, with more ferocity. I didn't want to look but my eyes were transfixed on her bloated form as she squirmed on the wet ground. The creature knelt beside her, reaching out a deformed hand to caress the side of her cheek.  She shushed the girl a few times before clutching the glass shard in her hand tightly and bringing it to rest at the top of her stomach. 

“The baby is coming” she sang before leaning an arm across her chest and pressing the sharp point of the glass against the top of her stomach. 


“I don’t want to die” Laura screamed at the figure now pinning her to the forest floor. 

I watched as the glass sunk into her flesh slicing deep into her stomach, the shard was dragged jaggedly down until she was split in two. The sounds Laura made were animalistic as she tried frantically to push the figure off of her, the stench of iron and desperation contaminating the air. Blood poured out of her at a frightening pace, her attempts growing weak quickly. She begged the thing to let her live. She begged me to help her. Her anguish reaching a desperate crescendo that reverberated around my skull. 

I am ashamed to admit that in that moment I did nothing to help her. 

I was too afraid. The echoes of her cries clouding my mind. 



As Laura’s weak pleas petered off, the last of her energy used. Her form slumped bonelessly against the sodden ground. My vision blurred with unshed tears.  

I didn’t think it could get any worse. I was wrong. 

Long and thin fingers curled around the flayed flaps of Laura's skin. I watched whatever had grown inside her begin to pull itself free, its stiff and aborted movements pushed her internal organs over and out of the gaping hole landing with a slap against the ground, Now merely just discarded offal. It seemed to almost unfold itself from within her, shoulders popping out into place, its slender and malnourished form curling its spine as it dragged itself free. The thing was completely drenched in her blood, its thin dark hair flattened against its misshapen head. 

The woman beside them cooed. 

I couldn't make out its features in the dark but something felt familiar about it. I didn't want to find out why, willing myself to move I managed to get my feet underneath me. I broke out into a frantic sprint. I could hear what sounded like the smacking of lips. I can only assume that whatever those things were, they were eating that poor girl. As I stumbled my way past shrubbery and thick tree roots I heard one of the creatures call out to me. 

“Now it’s your turn” 

—————————————————————————————.

Jagged breaths fought its way up my constricting airways, the burn of my lungs settling deep as I carried my bruised and aching body as far away as I could from the gruesome scene behind me. The hopelessness of the situation had me almost crumble to the floor in anguish, the fear latching on to my bones and weighing me down with every unsteady footfall. 

Here I was again. Running through the forest, confused, scared and alone. 

I don't know how long I was moving but my body was shaking, I couldn't pull in a full breath and my vision was darkening. 

I can't run anymore.

No sooner than the thought filtered into my brain did my legs give out and for the third time that night I found myself in the mud. I didn't get back up. 

Not for a long time. 

I just laid there, the damp mud soaked into my clothes. There was no breeze, no sound. It was as if my body no longer belonged to me, all of the aches and pains from the night seemed to fizzle out. Everything was numb, everything… so far away. Time, a preconceived notion that meant nothing to me as I lay there. The biting cold of the ground dissipated. I was floating in a void where nothing existed, not even me. 

An indiscernible amount of time passed. 

Some time later I was vaguely aware of a shadow appearing in my peripheral. A warm hand,  
an alive hand, my brain supplied sluggishly gripped my shoulder lightly. 

“Easy there kid, you gotta snap out of it” 

The rumble of his deep voice reverberated in my ears, there was a sense of calm, a sense of safety that came with this stranger. Maybe it had to do with the fact that the last things to be in my presence were actively trying to kill me and the only other human I had met was gutted like a fish in front of me but the sound of his voice grounded me, I filtered back into my body slowly, my senses pettering in and out until they settled back where they belong. The dull ache of my head and hands, the cold ground biting into my skin. The deep rooted panic. 

It all came back.
