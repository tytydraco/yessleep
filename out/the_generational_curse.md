part1


Where do i begin ? well...

Lets begin with some basics right?


When we where born we where

always thought to do better then  somone in the family


Mom or dad would say don't be like

jeff causing all sort of trouble


or don't be like amy who is

always drunk and high


Sounds fimiliar? well...

 if not

my parents love to say be


More like jeff a success in

everything he does


Or be more like amy she knows

what she wants to do for her

 future than wasting it like you


I know it hurts right?


Me and my parents lived in a city

that was full of crime


They made the decision that it was

time to move


So farwell gotham of nevertown and

wellcome zeptown


aah a fresh start i get to do things

over again

how many people can say that?


but nothing prepaird me for

what was coming


life is like a dream and some times

you wake up just to make

sure your alive


not for me no,  it all started when we

moved in to our new house


strange house but big it had 6

bedrooms,2 bathrooms,

and the garden

i cant  explain how grand it was.


but everything changed

 when i stept inside


i went in at the back of the house

walking in it had a very

creepy kitchen like it


there where ghost living in it

dark depressing and cold


i make my way up to the

stairs passing the cold living room

that had this creepy door to the cellar


i walked up the

creaking stairs

up standing over the bathroom door

it was the only peacefull


place i feld like it

wasint haunted by the feeling

of cold sad suffocating poison


i walked towarts it

and a warm breath Like a

 warm summernight


wisperd my name in my right ear

clear as the stillnes of the night


 michelllee... michelle...

the thing of whatever that was 


cold i went stiff my body

was like i was stuck in a trance

the next thing i heard i could belive what happend


steps slowly walking towards the second floor

of the house

creaking in my ear like nails running true a schoolbord


I shook it off.... off!

me and made up in my mind

that it was just a split second of my imagination


i went up the stairs of the second floor

 and unpacked my stuff


i wasent going to screw

my fresh start for some illusion


Afther unpacking

i went in to town to do some errands


ather that i went in to a nice

looking french cafe and had myself some good wine


i was sipping and i looked at the reflection of my glass

and saw a spirit figured cloud

as dark as night floating


like the coldness of the night

eyes as red as a bloodmoon


just for a split second everything

went cold cold sweat running down my back


i was standing still

and could not move an inch


in a trance i parted away my way back to reality

and just like that what i saw

 that moment in my refelction vanished


a woman who looked like she was

 your friendly next door neighbour


looked at me and sade with the softest voice...

you looked like you was

out of this world are you ok she sade


i was still in shock by the well...

the that thing or whatever


i looked at her and sade what?

did you ever heard of our

dear lord jesus


well that man can save you from

what you just saw she sade


I... I... was shooked

 how did she know? what?

 how?  what did you say i sade to her ?


she give me a card and left. well that was wierd

well could it get any  weirder i thought


i laughed

not that laugh you

make when you almost fucked up

but everything turned perfectly fine


it was more the sound of going

crazy just loosing your grip from reality kind of laugh


i looked at the card

it was a black card with golden letters

i thought to myself

ok ..this is fancy for a church


on the card was written

an adress to a house ok weird


i turend the card around and in big fat

letters it sade


get rid of the ones watching you
