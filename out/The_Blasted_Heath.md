He told me they felt an odd reluctance as the landscape revealed distant stone chimneys and gothic structures, jutting from the horizon. He told me their trek had led them to a gaping depression in the ground that encroached upon the surrounding valleys and glens.

The gray desolation that sprawled open to the sky had a crumbling town in the center of its yawning black maw. Though vast, the rocky farms and ancient cottages were so tightly clustered that it strained their eyes to even look at, he said.

It was challenging, trying to document his recollection through the fatigue of his broken bones and dismal hysteria. Nevertheless, as his voice strained forward, so did my pen, from his raspy scrapings to my chicken scratch scribble. I sat beside the bedridden jeweler as he recounted the events that transpired inside that blasted heath, an expedition on my behalf. The name was coined by my father, fitting not just for way back when, but for its modern cosmicity.

I came from money, born into a family of three brothers and three sisters, all spoiled while I experienced the typical firstborn neglect. I was treated as the glue one forgets at the bottom of a toolbox, noticed only when the other tools failed. So when all my siblings died, along with my mother and father, it came as no shock to find myself last in line for the inheritance, although being the oldest.

I was bitter in those days, wishing my family would simply melt away, until, in the most literal sense, my wish was granted. In their absence, money and worldly possessions became my only family, and I found myself willing to pay any price for another member.

My father, a respected foreman, led a team that uncovered a rock containing an unknown metal. It laid within a Native American burial ground, and he was instructed by the government to leave it untouched.

It wasn’t out of fear of ancestral warnings or the weight of colonial guilt that the authorities wanted it to be left alone. The law did not give a single damn about cultural respect or the scars of historical trauma. The rock, and the land around it, remained undisturbed because of the brooding, eternal death that seemed to cling to the cursed thing. Naturally, my father disobeyed, resulting in him and his men to meet their tragic end.

As my father’s son, I followed in his footsteps, assembling a team to finish what he couldn’t. But unlike him, I wasn’t driven by the hollow thrill of discovery, something he foolishly cherished. I longed to craft not an artifact just of wealth, but of meaning—something tangible to embody my struggles, my brilliance, my inevitability, my growing family.

With the unknown now slightly less mysterious, I was able to take the necessary precautions. I ensured I wouldn’t share my father’s fate by never setting foot on the site myself. Instead, I remained at the comfort of my own home, while my handsomely paid team carried out every instruction to the letter.

When the jeweler, my logistics coordinator and expedition leader, drifted back into consciousness, he asked a question. A question he visibly reconsidered before letting it fully form. 

“Why were we instructed to craft the artifact inside the cave?”

He was right. The portable devices did make the engagement exponentially more expensive. Without hesitation, I admitted that we were breaking the law. We had violated the Antiquities Act, which provides broad legal protection to cultural and scientific resources located on federal land. Put plainly, the government wanted it to be their discovery to profit by and not ours to meddle in. But, I wasn’t about to surrender this discovery forged by my own blood before me.

The gauze wrapped around the jeweler’s battered features swelled as his expression shifted to astonishment. Without a word, I saw the comprehension settle in as he then understood why they were under a time constraint and why the officials had arrived unannounced.

“Have you no shame?!” he asked. 

“It didn’t trouble me in the slightest,” I told him. I knew I hadn’t been entirely forthright about the whole ordeal, but if only he understood how the normalities of humanity were cruelly judged by the law, he might grasp how truly stifling such restrictions are to the human experience.

The jeweler snapped again, “Tell me, did money turn you into some rich fella with twisted habits, or were you always twisted and the money just let you show it?”

“Depends on the circumstance,” I said wryly, bringing our bitter repartee to a halt. As I swapped out the bag on his IV, I told the flustered jeweler to finish his account of what happened if he ever expected to see a dime. 

Hesitantly, he complied, offering up a few trivial details to prime his memory of the voyage. I don’t use the word “voyage” lightly either— another swindle tucked in the details.

In order to craft the finest trinkets out of a rare unknown metal, entirely within a cave, I had to assemble a specialized team equipped with portable tools and machinery designed for a remote, confined environment. 

I hired metallurgists and refinery technicians. This specialized group was made up of five people, sharing the responsibility of transporting the portable power source.

I had mining technicians and ore processors. This group of four carried the portable smelting furnace.

There were the Goldsmiths and Bench Jewelers. This group consisted of three members who hauled the workbench, all the crucibles, and tongs.

Lastly, and most importantly, the jeweler. Master of every discipline, he knew planning and problem-solving like the back of his hand. As the expedition leader, he was responsible for overseeing the project’s logistics within the cave. He alone bore the weight of the lighting equipment and all additional safety gear.

We were dealing with a groundbreaking element and figured I’d be better safe than sorry. So last minute, I flew in a geologist and a mineralogist for a second and third opinion. Unfortunately it was that very safety that made me bitterly sorry for hiring those two in the first place. 

They were inseparable and the gentleman had set his heart on proposing that day. Counting the extra miners that helped with the pickaxes and drills, I hired twenty-five individuals in total, but about sixty people showed. Most of the workers I brought on knew each other beforehand, so when news of the anticipated proposal had spread, my employees decided to invite friends and family— an arrangement I wasn’t informed about. 

Their companions trailed my crew discreetly to keep the girlfriend, the geologist, from noticing. Their goal was to set up a small surprise celebration outside the cave for when the job and proposal were done. They brought grills, expensive cuts of meats, booze, balloons, confetti; all tiny weights that contributed to their colossal disappointment. Have they no regard for the moderation of leisure?

I’ll admit, I may have pitched the job as if the cave were tucked just off the coast of some glittering metropolis. I’m sure they likely expected coffee shops, malls, and a bit of civilized company. I almost wish I saw the devastation on their faces once they approached that blasted heath. Technically, I was truthful, though I did leave out the bit about the city falling into ruin and the cave lying beneath a church’s cellar. Even so, could they not comprehend the separation of work and play, or are they simply fools eager to escape the turmoil of daily life?

The jeweler continued, describing the venture inside the cavernous wound with introspective detail, his mood waning as the thrill of telling me about the festivities began to fade. 

He told me how beyond the church cellar was a staircase descending into a declivity deeper than the eye could fathom. Smothered in darkness, the team relied entirely on their voices to guide them each step down with the heavy machinery. 

The jeweler said he’d been trying to conserve the LED lights’ battery but was forced to switch one on when the mineralogist, the groom to be, took a spill down the stairs. By God’s grace, he added, they were already near the bottom. Still, all the team could do once he slipped was stand, and wince at every brutal slaps of his limbs against the concrete, as he tried catching himself the way down.

Expecting a fatal thud, they instead heard a cascade of clattering and rattles. At the base of the stairs was a sea of brittle bones, strewn across the floor of a vast, dome-shaped chamber. 

“At its center sat the rock, chaotically pulsing with a strange, dim glow that caught and scattered beams of our lights.”

The fear, the jeweler claimed, was intensely irrational, like an instinctive foreboding. No time was wasted arranging the lights or setting up the stations. Haste became an unspoken rule, stemming not from the constraint of time I had on them, nor the litter of human bones, or even the tightening grip of claustrophobia, but from something less tangible. The mineralogist’s demeanor had grown increasingly strange, his urgency only deepening the sense of disorientation for everyone. It showed in his movements, laced with a sloppiness and tension that made the others uneasy.

He became moody and combative, confrontational with anyone who didn’t match his pace. One of my technicians had pointed out his limp, revealing he was walking on a broken ankle, something that might have been taken care of had he not been so anxious. By the time the fluorescents were wired in, the man was already on his knees, hunched over the rock in silent examination.

Everyone had figured the poor guy was overwhelmed or nervous about the proposal. But, the jeweler said he’d later approach the scientist, urging him to get his ankle treated before examining the rock fully, but the mineralogist refused. He said he didn’t want to disappoint me and spoil this opportunity.  

Understandable, I suppose, considering I’d agreed to also pay for the wedding on top of his fee, if and only if they get the job done timely. Then again, it’s almost uncomprehendable how circumstances could change a man.

As the jeweler turned to leave him be, he noticed the mineralogist tugging at something in a panic. His arm was wedged deep inside one of the many cavities on the rock. Without warning, a burst of thick white fluid shot out, coating him from his wrist, up to his shoulder. It hardened almost instantly, sealing his arm in place. He screamed, not just from the pain, but from the certainty that he might lose his arm.

As the crew hurried over, the geologist knelt beside him, careful not to touch him. Her instinct was to comfort, but caution held her still. The substance clinging to his arm started to pulsate, like a slow deliberate breath. Everyone who could began running tests immediately to find a solution.

Analysis revealed something far worse than stone: a hybrid of metal and life equating to an organism forged of an alloyed plant. Unheard of. It responded to stimuli, shifting from liquid to solid at will. In an act of synthesis, it had bonded itself with the mineralogist. His arm was entombed in something sentient. Through further examination, the group realized, with great horror, that he wasn’t trapped in the thing, but was now part of it.

This was the moment the jeweler said he declared the crafting was to come to an abrupt and indefinite halt. No one were to touch another tool until they understood what this thing was, or at the very least, until they freed the mineralogist from its grip. But the substance defied every method of analysis with every probe yielding contradictions.

Eventually after a series of trial and error, a relieving, yet disturbing, implication emerged. They concluded that water acted as a flux, drastically lowering its melting point. The group capitalized off that piece of information using hydration to render it pliable, then using heat to break it down.

At this point in the jeweler’s account, I was on the edge of my seat intensely captivated, like a kid with late night hbo. He had stopped his telling with an abrupt wheeze, asking me another question that had me urging his curiosity to tread lightly. 

“With all the finest gold and materials at your fingertips, why this?”

I explained to him how desire walks a fine line between what’s allowed and what’s forgivable. Despite breaking the law, I couldn’t shake the need for this celestial-like metal. The collection I had accumulated after my family’s death became everything to me, more than family actually. It became a fixation that overpowered any sense of rationality. 

Loneliness amplifying my curiosity, twisting my desires into something uncontrollable, admittedly. I was desperate for it. Like the mineralogist working for his check and wedding, like the crew ready to drop everything out of fear; when desperation reveals, it defines. I know it sounds selfish but what is done will always be judged harshly until you’re the one doing it.

I neglected to explain any further, and once again, I shut down his ridiculous inquisitiveness, demanding that he finish telling me what he saw. He did so, continuing with what the mineralogist had said just before getting his arm stuck. 

“Just give me one more—“

He said it when he was first examining the rock, back when the jeweler was urging him to take care of his ankle. Our best guess was that he meant to say one more minute or second, but that wasn’t the point. The jeweler mentioned this because the obscenities the mineralogist began spewing were variations of this unfinished sentence. Things like, and I quote,

“One more! One more to even it out!” 

“I need one more, don’t you see? It knows I need it!” 

“It’s not enough, it’s never enough—give me one more!”

At first, the group dismissed the ramblings as post-traumatic hallucinations. As would I, but it wasn’t until it happened to someone else that he began to correlate this horrific-like phenomena.
 
She came off as composed and attentive, all while maintaining a smart distance. But when the mineralogist reached into his pocket with his free hand and pulled out the ring, the geologist lost it. 

She dropped to her knees, weeping like a baby, collapsing into her lover. The instant she fell into the mineralogist’s arms, the rock cracked open, shooting the same liquid onto the geologist’s shoulder, yanking her in. This was when the jeweler fell quiet for a second amidst his report, which spoke louder than his next words ever would. 

“She was part of it now,” the jeweler told me. “His right arm and her left shoulder were glued to that bolder. I’ve never seen something so achingly romantic and goddamn terrifying at the same time.” 

Back to his point before, her final coherent words before succumbing to the lifeform were exactly what anyone would expect. “Yes, of course”. What followed were words no one would anticipate. —And I quote, 

“Indubitably, it wills me.”

 “Thy will be done.”

“Yes, I’m made clean.”

Observation suggests that once an individual is consumed by this organism, they enter some kind of state of linguistic recursion. Their cognitive process is interrupted, derailed, then fixed to questionably unintended variations of their final spoken words. I say ‘questionably unintended’ deliberately because it’s possible what they’re saying is intentional, just not by them. 

I can’t stop imagining it— your own consciousness trapped in the state of mind of your last functioning moment. Unmoved by no circumstance, beyond the reach of any emotion. Though, only a hypothesis, the abstract nightmare bore a hole into my imagination, as it did with the jeweler’s. Yes, I continue to write this, though my documentation is starting to sound like pure fiction. As signs of his fever began returning, his voice grew hoarse and hysterical.

“Could it be cognitive disruption, a neurological glitch, physiological break, god help me— a supernatural interference!?” he questioned. “Merely thinking about this made me rethink the definition of a diagnosis.”

He described the events that followed as, and I quote, “ lovecraftian”. Who knew such a fidgety prude was into such literature.

It wasn’t long before the group’s panic had driven them to act. The jeweler, being the only levelheaded one at the time, yelled for some of the goldsmiths and miners to back away, but they were too caught up in the moment to realize how this chaos unfolded in the first place.

Repeating the same mistake as the couple, the bunch moved forward with urgency. Some had buckets of water while one of the goldsmiths wielded a flamethrower, disastrously claiming they were going to pry the engaged couple loose.

The jeweler weakly snapped his fingers. The color flushing from his face and the weight in his voice strained, “They all became part of…”

 I have to say, my jaw was on the floor during that slither of silence. I was no longer looking at what I was writing, but scribbling with my ears and listening with my eyes, if you could imagine. 

As expected, the rock discharge it’s fluid on to everyone in proximity. The resulting amalgamation of individuals, all stuck to a single rock, was nauseating to look at, he said. They scrambled and scraped at nothing, climbing over one another in attempt to break free. Some were yoked by their neck, others snagged by the chest or spine, and a few by their legs. 

As the jeweler continued to explain, he began calling them an ‘it’, as if the single mass of bodies struggling to break free were one being entirely. He noticed how ‘it’ seemed to undergo what looked to be a digestion period each time someone was attached. They would all stand and scream in unison as if the skin were being flayed from their bodies, twitched as if nerves were short-circuiting. Then came an off putting calmness, perhaps an awakening of consciousness, before each started to spew their own disjointed ramblings. In this case, the process took a while due to the sheer number of people entangled in the rock at once. 

Instantly, I questioned the jeweler on how they— ‘it’ moved. He explained due to arms and legs coming from every angle, it moved by perpetually tripping and catching its own fall. Momentum. When the mineralogist pitched forward, a goldsmith snagged by his neck would catch the fall. When a miner embedded at the chest lurched from balance, a metallurgist or ore processor pinned by their legs would plant a hand and shove. 

I doubt they were competent in carrying the workbenches down the cellar stairs, meaning this type of coordination was driven by some kind of outside influence for communication. A group delusion? Shared psychosis? Lord have mercy, a hive mind?

Naturally, the rest of the party dropped what they were doing and made a beeline for the exist, but ‘it’ calculated such, blocking the way. The jeweler managed to escape by the skin of his teeth, slipping through the chaos in the thick of the others’ demise. Only he and three other miners managed to make it back up the stairs and out the cellar doors.

“It followed us…” he added. “It had trouble getting through the cellar doors, but it still pushed even when ‘they’ looked dead. There was blood everywhere. Deep, deep abrasions and lacerations. Hyperextension. Posterior dislocations. I remember the geologist’s scalp was hanging off her head, and the damn woman was still mumbling stuff like ‘I do’! The abomination either loved the pain or didn’t feel it.” 

His voice tightened and quivering at the edges. His composure really collapsed when describing his arrest on the premises. Earlier, officers had shut the celebration down and detained every friend and family member, threatening to jail every person that walked out of the cave. Once in custody, there was no point in saying anything, he explained. The jeweler said he just sat there in handcuffs, locked in a dissociative stupor as the three miners he escaped with, the police, and everyone around were consumed by the organism that followed them out.

The jeweler remaining entirely unresponsive while the others screamed and fled for their lives raised questions. Either they possessed something he lacked or the thing was downright terrorizing the poor bastard.

This led me to believe this cosmic ball of god-knows-what exhibited a clear reaction to the commotion. It’s safe to say it was even attracted to it. 

‘It’ eventually took the form of a swollen tumor, porous and bubbly. No longer was it catching its fall, but rolling over the individuals fused with it, driving through their disfigurement. The rock at its core was obscured by a dense accumulation of bodies. Beneath them, more people compacted, pressed tightly together. 

“When I looked up at that clusterfucker, I immediately saw her. Amongst them was my wife, Natalia. From the look on her face, my best guess is that she was upset with me in her final moments. Probably upset we were taking so long inside the cave, knowing her. I’ve never seen her so angry, and now she’s stuck that way. Stuck!” he said snorting, one that landed somewhere between a snicker and a grunt. 
“I don’t know what life is anymore. Amazing how the raw context of something so gritty can look so comical, an irrefutable concoction.”

The jeweler has officially lost it. The man started laughing so hard, his cackling reached an outright mutiny, but I somewhat understood what he meant. The mind retreats to laughter when it cannot bear the truth of what it saw— the same mechanism that binds comedy and horror. Both contain surprise and timing, tension and catharsis. This wasn’t madness, but the reward of survival. 

The man didn’t have to finish his account because I saw it all for myself. As if god himself took pity on this crumbling excuse of a human being, it began to rain. Not only did the rainfall snap him out of his cognitive shutdown, but gave him an opening. He turned and bolted for those cellar doors, with ‘it’ no more than a paper thin distance behind, and hurled himself down the concrete steps. Not the brightest move, but when death is imminent, circumstances defines. 

Even through shattered bones and barely clinging to consciousness, the SOB still found his way to the flamethrower. I figured what happened next was just like all those years ago when the rain also acted as a flux for the bomb strapped to my father’s chest. 

When I went down to retrieve the jeweler, the place was knee deep in a pinkish muck. Puss, blood, piss and whatever liquid the human body produces, I presume. He was drifting on the surface, swaying with bones and remains like a vegetable stew, struggling to keep his head above the sludge to breathe.

I don’t know how he got his grubby hands on it, but I had to pry the couple’s engagement ring from his hand, another factitious payment for the mineralogist. Who knew this piece of jewelry would be the catalyst of their demise, stemming back all those years ago when my father took it from these cursed grounds. It was nestled right next to this cosmic mineral.

I know my appetite for treasure was something I inherited from my father, but this ring is the one piece I want no business with. I keep it only because of the uncanny ways it constantly finds its way back to me. I’ve handed it off to nearly every group I’ve sent out here, only for it to return each time in pristine condition. Deep down, I’d like to think of it as an agreement between me and that rock: I keep sending it folks to feed on and it’ll reward me someday, letting me harvest all the materials it has to offer.

I helped the jeweler into a wheelchair, wheeling him to the window and presenting the crumbling city outside— my home town. This is the place my father destroyed because of his greed, because he couldn’t put the ring back. Like the feds, he had no cultural respect, trying to get paid off the scars of historical trauma. I understand because just like my view on the regulation of law, our desires are cruelly judged by humanity. 

And as I pointed to the wreckage of my childhood, he just kept laughing. I showed him the school where I was humiliated, the dead-end  jobs that bled me dry, and the house where I was overlooked by my own family in every way. He grew quiet when I pointed to the church I used to attend every Sunday morning. Where the town thought they could erase a Native American burial ground just by simply building a church over it. Where my father thought he could steal from lineages without suffering the weight of vengeance. 

There were no meteor-shaped organisms or flesh-fusing metals before he pulled the trinket from its resting place, I told the jeweler. I laid out my plan to keep feeding ‘it’ until one day, I send the right team capable of harvesting that metal. One day when I have the artifact made, who knows, maybe I’ll command troops from Hell. But ultimately, I will make my family and this rotten town toss in their graves for underestimating me.  

I pat the jeweler on the back and thanked him for his service as the 52nd team I sent out there.
