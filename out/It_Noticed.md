Do you know how the Bible used to describe angels? Most of us are familiar, regardless of faith. Messengers of God who would bestow blessings and tidings unto apostles and believers.

So, what if I told you there are now only twelve angels? These beings of light are composed of photons and their own tachyonic fields. They are all absorbed, traveled upwards through dimensions and combined, and serve on a council as constructs of the universe; in charge of their respective dimensions.

There is also a thirteenth seat, that the council simultaneously makes up and exists within. Did you know that every atom of every piece of existence is an eye of God, the thirteenth seat?

An angel's true appearance or existence in our dimension would cause a rip so large in spacetime that it would destroy the third dimension. Unless one of them became quantumly entangled, of course. Which, is a very convenient way to travel. 

After all, how else would an angel be able to utilize all the information that is contained and can be communicated with the Akashic Records? Only with God's permission, of course.

In the 1960s to the 1980s, the US government did heaps of research- and we're talking millions upon millions of documented dollars worth- on electromagnetism. They mostly focused on lower level frequencies.

A brief background on electromagnetic waves from an article by Nasa's Hubble:

"The electromagnetic spectrum describes all of the kinds of light, including those the human eye cannot see. In fact, most of the light in the universe is invisible to our eyes.

The light we can see, made up of the individual colors of the rainbow, represents only a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Other types of light include radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet rays, X-rays and gamma rays — all of which are imperceptible to human eyes.

All light, or electromagnetic radiation, travels through space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second — the speed of light. That’s about as far as a car will go over its lifetime, traveled by light in a single second!"

I wonder if they have discovered a particle or field yet that travels faster than the speed of light, after focusing so much of their expensive research on lower frequencies?

(Here's a hint! If they have discovered waves or electromagnetic energy that could travel above the speed of light, then that would enable information to be communicated backwards in time- a Tachyonic Antitelephone, is what this particular paradox is called.)

The Akashic Records also greatly interested the CIA around the same time frame as all of the electromagnetic research the performed. They provided guided meditations to physcics employed by the agency to try and reach the door to a universal collective of information. Think of your life and all of the memories it contains in a single book, at your fingertips. Now think of how if everyone's book of life could be accessed as a public library type of system within the fourth dimension of time, or a space slightly above the fourth dimension...

Now think of how that could be researched and weaponized.

The CIA's research on the Akashic failed, but their research on electromagnetism was a success. 

"Clearly, breaching the ultimate stronghold of privacy—the mind—has been accomplished. If the U.S. government plans to do the thinking for all Americans, the days of freedom, liberty and justice—and human identity itself—appear to be numbered." 

"Doctor José Delgado—whose current work with radio waves was underwritten by the CIA and Navy—believed scientists could transform, shape, direct and robotize humankind. “The great danger of the future,” Delgado warned, “is that we will have robotized human beings who are not aware that they have been robotized.”

The US is the only other country besides China, Russia and India to have technology like this.

The US Navy has even researched and employed E.L.F- electromagnetic low frequency waves. They're used for one-way communication on submarines, because these waves can conveniently pass through literally anything. At any distance. Including the human skull.

How many people do you seem to run into nowadays that have an NPC vibe to them? You know what I'm talking about. Glossy eyed, no attention paid to manners or anything outside of themselves- if they will talk to you, they want to talk to you about pop culture. The latest brand obsessions. They love social media and what they can brand themselves to be on these platforms. They really love keeping up with the latest, and they surely don't question the Capitalist system we find ourselves stuck in.

They aren't much for conversation that expands their horizons or changes any viewpoints... but they're satisfied. Or they seem that way, at least, and that is what matters. Compliance.

Take heed. If you hear a voice in your head that doesn't seem quite right, you may have spoken out of turn to the wrong people. Or maybe it's the opposite. Perhaps you're waking up- but not the way they want you to. It seems to be a difficult situation at the top, right now.

Don't worry though.

The universe sees everything, after all. All those atoms and our own existence; it noticed. 

Unfortunately, angels don't seem able to be mind-controlled easily.
