I would be lying if I said that growing up I wasn't spoiled. I was the first, and only, granddaughter and daughter. My grandfather was the worst of all when it came to pampering me. There was really only one rule he had, never go into the woods alone. Several of my cousins would hunt on the property, and had I wandered out there I might catch a stray bullet. It seemed reasonable enough even as a child, so I never fought him on it. I simply knew that when it came to the woods I wasn't allowed out there alone and according to pops, "That's the end of that. No ifs, ands, or buts." 

I wish he was right. I wish that had been the end of it. 

Pops' mind went rapidly in the end. It was stroke that took him from us, but long before that he became a shell of the man I had loved so deeply. It was cold in the months leading up to his passing, an unforgiving winter, but even when the frost melted we couldn't shake the ice that gnawed at our hearts. We all knew he was dying. None of us would say it. We danced gracefully around the topic being sure to use flowery language, but we all knew. 

On sunny days, Pops would sit out on the front porch smoking and tell us how he was talking to God. He would point to a small clearing across the road that he had so joyously deemed his 'Jesus spot.' 

"You can see him out there. He glows so bright that the leaves twinkle. You see him don't you Grace? My God is so beautiful." 

I had no reason to tell him there was no one out there so I always agreed with him, "God is good." 

He'd place his shaky hand on my shoulder and do his best to squeeze it. I had grown to flinch at that touch. Not because I didn't want his hands on me. That was far from the case. If I could mentally catalog the way his wrinkled fingers brushed against my back I would. In fact, if I could've stopped the clock and lived in that moment I wouldn't have hesitated. I just couldn't bare to feel how weak he had become. 

"Every day baby girl, every day." 

Reminding myself of his conversations with God was the only thing that had brought me peace in dealing with his death. For two years I believed that he was okay. That he was in heaven, and that in his final days maybe God really had come to speak with him in that clearing across the holler. 

Until tonight, I let myself believe he had been conversing with the lord. Tonight, I sat on those same steps. I stared at that same baren patch. I even smoked the same brand of cigarettes I used to bum from him. Tonight, I saw what he had been talking to all of that time, and that thing wasn't God.

It's a cliche as old as time. People talk about the day that life as they knew it changed and they never fail to say the same thing. That everything leading up to the beginning of the end had been just another mundane day. Such is true for me. I woke up to Ma rummaging around in the kitchen. Just like Pops her memory had gone, and I had become her caretaker. 

It was my responsibility to cook her meals, bathe her, dress her, and keep her as stimulated as I possibly could. I had been close with Ma too growing up, so I didn't mind the work. I would've done it for free, but I certainly didn't complain that I was getting paid to spend the days with one of my loved ones. I would stay with Ma Sunday night to Thursday morning.

You can hardly blame me for stepping out to take a smoke break once I was sure she was asleep every night. It had become the only time I really got to even breathe. It was my only alone time. At least I thought it was. After tonight, after seeing the way that thing stared at me from across the dirt road. I don't want to think about how long I've had, unwanted, company.
