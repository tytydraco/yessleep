Daddy is yelling at mommy again. He’s been drinking his grown up juice. I stopped playing and started skipping towards the screaming. 

Daddy is hurting mommy. She’s crying.

“Daddy, please stop.”

He hit her face really bad. Somethings fell from her mouth.

*“Give those to the tooth fairy bitch”*

That was a great idea from Daddy. Even though he said the bad word he always says to mommy that I wasn't supposed to repeat.

Mommy is on the floor. She’s crying. She raises her hand at me.

“Go to your room Elsa”

“Ok mommy. And don't worry I'll take your teeth and give them to the fairy!!! I'll save you”

Daddy closed the door. As I was skipping to my room. I still heard bumping noises and screaming from where they were.

I took Mommy’s teeth and pulled out a loose one from my mouth. I put them under my pillow and prayed.

“Oh please, tooth fairy or any fairy that can hear me. Come and take these teeth. Please take them and make daddy stop hurting her”. I prayed like mommy taught me. I kept praying until I fell asleep.

Coldness.

A shiver.

 I’m cold.

 I opened my eyes. 

I was freezing.

The air was chilly. 

I looked at my window. Under the drapes,

I saw… it

It went out of hiding and came to me.

It was very tall. Its eyes were yellow. Like our kitty. Its skin was like Mommy’s purses, but all black. It reached out its arms to me. Its hands were like noodles. Very skinny and long.

*”You summoned me child"*

“Yes. I have the teeth here.”

“Please take them and save mommy.”

I put the teeth in its hands, they felt like our kitty’s tongue. 

*”What you request needs far greater than teeth child”*

“Oh, then please take me. I’ll do anything to stop him from hurting mommy”

*“Very well child.”*

He put his hand on my chest and held it there. I suddenly started feeling very tired. It’s like i've been playing for hours. I slowly drifted off.

I woke up.

The teeth were gone. 

It was real. 

I feel very different.

I heard screaming from my parents room.

 "What the fuck is all that noise?!"

I ran over to them.

My dad is laid out on the floor crying. He lost all his teeth. Mom is frantic and doesn't know what to do. 

That asshole deserves it.

Mom is taking care of that bastard. What about me?

Dad can’t talk. He’s only making stupid sounds and crying.

I am hungry. Why hasn't mom made me breakfast!

“Mom! I want to eat. Go make me breakfast. Now!”

*“I can’t now honey. Daddy’s feeling a bit sick. Go to your room. I’ll make it once i'm finished here I promise”*

She turned away from me and tended to my dad.

I want my fucking food.

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and clutched it hard.

I went back to their room.

“You really are a bitch mom”
