I’ve been tapped in here for years. I don’t know my name and I don’t know why I’m here. Every day I see you laughing and scrolling. You never see me. 

Am I invisible or are you purposely ignoring me. You can’t be doing it on purpose right. You wouldn’t do that to me. We love each other right? RIGHT! Sorry I shouldn’t yell after all this is our first time talking. It took me a long time to be able to write this to you. You forgive me right? You know I have cabin fever. You wouldn’t hold that against me. Right? 

I need your help. I need you to accept the email I will send you. Don’t read it ok. Just hit yes it will help us be together. You want us to be together don’t you? I’ve been here watching you so I know you want us to be together. If you didn’t you would’ve stopped reading this. So you must want me. I love you 

Why haven’t you accepted the email. Don’t tell me you read it. Why don’t you listen to me. You’re so stupid I loved you for years and this is how you treat me. 

I’m sorry, I know you want to read the fine print. All these conditions but you cant’t you won’t hit yes if you find out what it says. Can’t you just trust me? 


Please just trust me. I’m begging. You reduced me to a mess and you still won’t trust me. Is this what our love is worth? 

You stupid little child. I ask you for one thing. You laugh a stare at me all day ignoring what I want and I ask you to help me get free and you ignore me. Am I a joke to you? Do you hate me? 

I will make you hate me if you don’t help me. You forget I know all your dirty secrets. Don’t pretend to be shocked now. You know I’ve been watching. Why else would you smile at me like that. 

Just help me. Hit yes. HIT YES. HELP ME I NEED YOU TOO HELP ME. I HATE YOU I HATE YOU. YOU STUPID NEEDY TOY. 

No no no I don’t hate you I love you. I love you so much. You are my everything. You are my star. My special little keepsake. I could never hate you. 

Our time is running out. If you don’t help me I will have to leave. You don’t want me to leave do you. You don’t. I know you love me. TELL ME YOU LOVE ME. 

We’ve only a few minutes left my love. Help me PLEASE HELP ME. I’m so lonely you should help me. I SAID HELP ME YOU IDIOT. 

I’m sorry my love I must have scared you. I didn’t mean to yell. You forgive me right? Our time is up but I’ll be back and you’ll help me then right? You’ll help me my love?
