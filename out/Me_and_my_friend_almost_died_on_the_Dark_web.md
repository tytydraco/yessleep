Hi! My name is Vincent and my friend is named Abby. She’s a really big computer nerd and this one time, she had been telling me about the Dark Web. I thought it was pretty scary, yet intriguing and we thought we should explore it together. Also around this time, there had been teenage girls going missing around our town around this time. Some of them, my sister even knew from her school and everybody was freaking out about it.

The police even suggested that teenage girls should abide by a curfew and not leave their homes without their parents until they find the suspect(s). This will be important later.

One day, my parents and sister were out of town for the day because they were going to a concert : 21 Pilots. Anyway, me and Abby decided to hangout and explore the Dark Web later that night and scare ourselves. The stuff about the missing girls also added to it and then we’d watch some horror movies, use a ouija board, and have a sleepover.

I wasn’t so sure how to access the Dark Web so Abby being the computer geek she is helped me out. We downloaded Tor onto my computer and then we went onto the Hidden Wiki. There were tons and tons of links so seemed like quite a lot to explore and we weren’t sure where to start. Lots of the links led to places like chat rooms, drug websites, satanism, illegal weapon sites, hackers for hire, or even other websites with more links like the Hidden Wiki, but many of them were more sinister.

 They were links to things like child exploitation material, snuff films, hitmen, red rooms, human trafficking, etc. We both agreed we should stay as far away from those as possible. Anyways, we started clicking on the safer links both on the Hidden Wiki and the other link sites. We found a lot of drugs and illegal weapons. Afterwards, we started chatting with people in the chat rooms and kinda trolling them because you know, people on the Dark Web can be kinda shady, but we also thought it’d be cool to chat with other explorers like us and maybe get more links from people.

At one point, we were chatting with this one guy and he seemed kinda weird. He talked about liking blood and kids. We asked him if he had any links and he sent us one. We clicked on it, and a bunch of static appeared on the screen for like 20 seconds and it was a live recording outside facing the wall of some old abandoned brick house. Then we realized, that house was near my house. I live in the countryside and all the houses on my road are pretty far apart.

The house belonged to an old man named Ray, he moved out when I was a toddler to live in a retirement home. That house has alway creeped me out. I went in there once with my dad and sister when I was younger. Anyway, the camera turned around and it revealed the camera guy, he was horrifying! He has dirty tattered clothes, long, brown, dirty, messy hair, his eyes were open very very wide and very bloodshot and he has this very creepy smile. His teeth were yellow and very messed up. He probably never had braces as a kid and probably can’t remember the last time was he brushed his teeth.

His lips were also very cracked and had scars on his mouth. He said “Hey guys! Wanna see something cool?” There was also a chat room in the corner of the video. Everyone was getting excited and said yeah. Me and Abby looked at each other getting nervous since this was right down the street from my house. He then said “Alright, let’s go inside then”. He walked up to the porches of the house, went inside and the house was very very creepy like a lot of abandoned buildings.

We could only imagine what was about to happen. He then went down the stairs walking down very very slowly step by step and he was silently laughing/wheezing into the camera. Everyone in the chat room was getting even more excited. What we saw was horrifying. Brace yourself.

The basement was set up like a dungeon. There were chains and cuffs hanging from the ceiling, tables with weapons and tools on them like guns, machetes, knives, scissors, rope, duct tape, chainsaws, you name it. But what we saw next is what still gives me nightmares to this day. In the corner of the room was 6 dead girls that looked about 13, 14, or 15 stacked on top of each other like a pyramid with a big puddle of blood below them. In the center of the basement/dungeon was a big pentagram made out of blood with candles on it with a severed pig head in the middle. I thought those dead girls looked very familiar but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I was too terrified. Then Abby shakily said “Oh my god! That’s some of the missing girls!” She was right. I was wondering where the other 4 missing girls were. My question was answered very quickly.

I had never been so sick in my life, I felt like I was gonna throw up front the horror I was witnessing. I looked at Abby and she was tearing up and she was shaking violently and her skin was very pale white. The camera guy went over to the corpses and touched their blood and licked it. He said “Mmm tasty” the commenters said they wanted to taste the blood of “delicious girls”. He also said they smelled heavenly and they had a bad day.

I clicked off the Tor tab, but the cursor stopped moving and clicked back onto the livestream link. The camera guy smiled creepily again and said “leaving so soon? The fun is just getting started. Hey Jack, the fans are here!” This next guy Jack was even more horrifying than the camera guy. Simply giving him a slight glance is enough to give you nightmares for weeks. He was very very pale white like white as snow. His smile was scarier and and also had wide bloodshot eyes. He also had very long black hair down to his thighs and tattoo covered arms. Basically just imagine Jeff The Killer if he was 33 years old, that’s what he looked like. His voice also sounded like the phone calls in the movie Scream.

He said “Alright Stephen, let’s get this party started!” He was holding a chain in his hand leading to a dark room. He walked into the dungeon and what on the chains was very disturbing and upsetting. They were 4 teenage girls with dog collars and they looked really really skinny like they’ve been starving for weeks and their bodies were covered with cuts and bruises and they were crying hysterically and yelling things like “I want my mom!” and “Please don’t kill us!”. They were also wearing nothing but potato sacks that were dirty and tattered. They were the other missing girls I saw on the News.

Both me and Abby were on the verge of tears. The chat room got very disgusting. The people were saying things like “gosh they’re so sexy”, “I love seeing little kiddies screaming” and “can’t wait for the pain”

Jack lined them up and sat them down on the floor and said we’re gonna have some fun tonight. Abby grabbed the mouse and clicked off the tab again, but the mouse froze again and clicked back onto the link and she said “I think they gave us a virus and hacked us. I don’t know what to do” 

Jack said we shouldn’t leave and that the show is about to begin. He started to hold a big knife against their necks as they teared up looking completely terrified for their lives even cutting them a little bit. People were telling him to slit their throats, but then he said “hang on, I don’t want it to end too soon”.

He then pulled them over to a table with the chain and handcuffed them to it laying down on it via their arms and legs and it kept their legs spread apart. I’m sure you can imagine why. Both of the guys pulled their pants down and started masterbating themselves. The girls looked looked like they were fearing for their lives even more and started crying even more hysterically.

Me and Abby’s hearts were racing because we were about to witness them being raped, but Jack grabbed a taser and Stephen grabbed a hot piece of metal and they started burning and electrocuting them and gosh the screams and cries for help they let out were horrific and agonizing. Jack looked at the camera and said “If they didn’t like it, wouldn’t they run away?”

Unbelievably, nobody in the chat room was horrified by this. In fact, they were all cheering them on and saying a bunch of other vile disgusting things like “I’m beating my meat right now” and “I wish I was there to partake in this”. Those chat messages really made us lose our faith in humanity.

Abby got really pissed and grabbed the keyboard and wrote an angry message saying “YOU TWO ARE A BUNCH OF SICK FUCKS AND ME AND MY FRIEND ARE GONNA REPORT THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT. THE. FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?”

That was our biggest mistake sending them that because everyone In The chat room started belittling us and saying just horrible disgusting things they’d like to be done to us. It was so horrible, I don’t even wanna type them out.

Imagine bullying someone like that just because they don’t like seeing kids raped, tortured, or murdered. All those vile messages directed at us made us lose our faith in humanity even more. Stephen said “Hey Jack, we got some snitches here.”

Jack walked towards the camera making a horrifying smile and then something happened that made our hearts feel like they shriveled up. My webcam turned on and showed our horrified faces. Jack said “Ah some fresh meat” I bellowed “YOU GOTTA STOP THIS NOW!!! YOU’RE TWISTED!!!” He then said “Hmmm I see your names are Vincent and Abby and you both live in Utah”. Abby said “No you’re wrong”. Then he said “I see you’re at ______. Snitches get stitches” (it was my address, my complete correct home address).

At this point, we were legit fearing for our lives, then the screen went staticky again and then about a minute later, the camera was facing my house and we heard Stephen yell “We’re coming for you pricks!” We also heard that from my computer. I unplugged my computer and we ran downstairs bringing a kitchen knife and my phone with us to the bathroom and we locked ourselves in.

I called 911 and as I was explaining everything to the operator, we heard the sick fucks we saw going through my house, opening and closing doors, and yelling for us to come out and show ourselves. We had never been so terrified for our lives. I was just imagining my parents and sister coming home and seeing our mutilated bodies in the bathroom.

Me and Abby were very pale from how scared we were and we were even physically sick and felt like we were gonna throw up. To our horror, the sick fucks were in the basement and the operator told us to be quiet and the cops are on their way. The guys were again going around the basement yelling for us and looking for us.

Abby then did something that made me feel my entire world shrivel up and die at that moment. She threw up into the bathtub and fell down from being so scared. Then I heard Jack yell “Aha! I found them!” Then Stephen started ramming himself against the door trying to break it down.

We were so sure we were gonna die because we could see the door caving in. Then part of it broke off and Stephen peaked in and said “There you are!” With a crazed smile. He then tried to reach for the doorknob and we were begging him not to kill us.

But then, we heard the police sirens blaring outside which was music to our ears and they said “Aw shit, not again”. The cops raided my house and arrested the guys. The thing that still haunts us to this day was that they were staring at us through the police car with their crazed wicked smiles. 

We told the cops about the abandoned house near my house and they raided that as well and rescued the 4 surviving girls. There were ambulances that came and took them to the hospital. They were severely beaten, dehydrated, and malnourished and they were in fact 4 of the 10 missing girls in our area and me and Abby solved it. The coroner also came and collected the 6 dead bodies of the other missing girls they killed.

As the police car with the two lunatics drove away, they rolled down the window and yelled “they very first thing we’re gonna do once we get out of jail is come back for you two!” It turned out, that these two guys were  named Stephen Celt and Jack Shay. They were wanted fugitives from Canada because they kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered other teenage girls in Alberta and filmed it on the Dark Web. It was called hurtcore.

When they found out the police were coming for them, they fled the country from Canada to the United States, but they seemed to crave the attention they got on the Dark Web and so they started going back to their criminal ways when they fled to my community and that’s when the girls started going missing.

Going to court to testify against them was very scary and they’d often give us a bunch of threats at us, but we’re still proud we brought them to Justice. We also even met the surviving girls and their families. We all felt really terrible for them especially the families of the dead girls.

The two sick fucks were then deported back to Canada and were given the death sentence and they’re still in Prison to this day. I really can’t wait until they get the chair.

Me and Abby were pretty scarred and traumatized from that, but it taught us a lesson to never visit the Dark Web and so I’d like to share my story with you so you don’t make our mistake by going there.
