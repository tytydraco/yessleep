I don’t know if anyone’s going to read this. Honestly, I don’t even know if I *should* be writing it. Every time I sit down to try, I feel like closing my laptop and pretending none of this ever happened. That would be easier, wouldn’t it? Safer?

But easy and safe didn’t help me when this all started. I’m still here. I’m still trying to figure out what “here” even means after everything that happened.

I’m not a writer—I want to get that out of the way. This isn’t going to read like some polished story you’d find in a true crime blog. I’m just someone who can’t shake the feeling that if I don’t write this down, whatever’s out there will keep going. It’ll happen to someone else. And maybe next time, they won’t make it out.

If you’re here looking for answers, I don’t have them. I have fragments, flashes of memories I’m not even sure I trust anymore. I have questions I wish I could burn out of my head. And I have a story.

That’s all this is—a story. Make of it what you will. Believe me, or don’t. But if you ever find yourself on a lonely stretch of highway, and you catch a glimpse of an old building through the trees—keep driving.

Whatever you do, don’t stop.

  
\*\*\*



Even in the pale wash of moonlight, the building seems to swallow light rather than reflect it. Ashwood Sanitorium looks impossibly big, bigger than I remembered from the photos online. The trees press around it like an audience, their skeletal branches clawing at the brick; the windows gape like empty eye sockets, the frames jagged with broken glass. There’s no roof in places, just bare beams clawing at the night sky. It’s not just abandoned; it’s devoured. Time has crept over every surface, leaving deep cracks and mossy veins.



Cal leans over the wheel, peering up at the Sanitorium. “Eva,” he finally says, “You ever think about how places like this used to be… normal? Full of people? Nurses and patients, hot meals on trays?”



His voice pulls me out of my thoughts, but not far. “Yeah,” I murmur. “Hard to picture it now.”



We both sit there a moment longer, the engine ticking softly as it cools. I glance at Cal. The glow from the dashboard paints one side of his face, throwing the sharp edge of his jaw into relief. His nose, slightly crooked from a soccer mishap two summers ago, twitches like he’s smelling the damp air already leaking into the car. His dark, curly hair sticks out in chaotic tufts, flattened in places where his headphones must’ve rested earlier. He looks almost relaxed, but his hands grip the wheel too tight to match the rest of him.

	

“Place like this probably has bats,” I say, mostly to fill the silence.



“Or raccoons.” Cal finally leans back in his seat, pulling a battered flashlight from the glove compartment. “You know what I read once? If you get rabies and it reaches your brain, you’re toast. No cure, nothing.” He flicks the flashlight on, the beam jittering against the dashboard. “So, y’know, if something bites you in there—”



“I get it. Avoid the wildlife.”



He grins, wide and lopsided, as he pushes open the door. “See? You’re a fast learner.”



Outside, the cold bites harder than I expected. The air smells damp and metallic, like the first few drops of rain on a hot sidewalk. Gravel crunches underfoot as I step away from the car, the sound weirdly loud in the otherwise silent lot.



The town—if you could even call it that—is a few miles behind us, tucked into the folds of the valley. Ashwood doesn’t have much to offer beyond its convenience store and the kind of gossip that spreads faster than wildfire. Lately, though, the gossip has felt different. Meaner. The disappearances have seen to that. First it was Matt, who worked nights at the gas station. Then Sara, who used to babysit my cousin. And then Rachel. No one talks about Rachel.



“You’re quiet,” Cal says, stepping up beside me. His flashlight beam dances over the building’s façade, picking out the jagged edges of a few shattered windows.



“Just thinking.”



“About?”



“About how dumb this idea is.”



He laughs, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jacket. “You know, you say that every time, and yet here we are.”



He’s got a point. I could’ve said no. *I should’ve said no.* But Cal has a way of dragging you along with him. I’ve known him long enough to recognize the signs: the restless edge in his voice, the quick glances over his shoulder like he’s checking to make sure the world hasn’t caught up with him yet.



The sanatorium towers above us, its shadow pooling around the base like ink. Up close, the details are worse—bricks warped and crumbling, iron bars rusted to jagged points. The entrance yawns ahead, a hollow rectangle framed by broken concrete. The door itself is long gone, and the edges of the frame are streaked with something dark, like old water damage.



Cal’s flashlight skips over the opening, pausing on the remnants of a sign nailed just above it. The letters have mostly faded, but I can make out a few: *ASHWOOD STATE… TUBERCULOSIS.*



“God,” I mutter.



“Pretty cheery, huh?” Cal says, his grin softer now. “They used to send people out here to die, didn’t they?”



“Not at first. It was supposed to save them.”



“Well, it clearly worked wonders.” He nods toward the entrance. “Ready to see what’s left?”



I don’t answer right away, letting my gaze trace the sanatorium’s shape again. There’s something off about the way it sits against the trees—too sharp, like it’s been cut out of the world around it and pasted here.



“You okay?” Cal asks, his grin gone.



“Yeah,” I lie.



He holds out the flashlight, the beam steady now. “You take this. I’ll use my phone.”



I don’t argue. The flashlight feels solid in my hand, its weight somehow comforting.



Cal steps toward the entrance, his silhouette framed against the dark interior. He pauses there, looking back at me, his expression unreadable.



“Last chance to chicken out,” he says, though his voice is quieter than before.



I take a deep breath and follow him in.



Stepping inside feels like crossing a threshold into another world, one where light and sound don’t work the way they should. The first thing I notice is the temperature—colder than it has any right to be, the kind of chill that feels alive. The beam from my flashlight bounces across the walls, catching on patches of peeling paint and exposed brick. The air smells even worse in here: damp and sour, with a metallic tang that sticks in the back of my throat.



The lobby must’ve been grand once. You can tell by the vaulted ceiling, its plasterwork cracked and sagging, and the marble floor, now chipped and filthy. A rusted wheelchair sits overturned near the middle of the room, one wheel bent at an awkward angle. Against the far wall, a reception desk leans forward like it’s on the verge of collapse, its surface covered in a thick layer of dust and debris.



Cal whistles low, the sound echoing in the vast space. “Man, this is… something.”



“Yeah,” I say, though my voice sounds flat, small.



He sweeps his phone light across the room, illuminating a series of faded posters peeling off the walls. One of them has a grainy image of a man in a white coat, smiling wide beneath the words: “Health and Hope for All.” *Yeah, sure.*



“You think they knew?” Cal asks, pointing to the poster.



“Knew what?”



“That this place was going to end up like this?”



I don’t answer. Instead, I move toward the reception desk, careful to avoid the scattered shards of glass and twisted metal littering the floor. Up close, the desk looks worse. There’s a large, dark stain on its surface that spreads down one side, like something seeped into the wood and refused to leave. Behind it, there’s an open doorway leading to what I assume was an office. My flashlight reveals an overturned filing cabinet, its drawers pulled out and scattered. 



“What’s over there?” Cal calls.



“Not much.” 



He’s already moved on, his light flickering across the far wall. There’s a directory there, or what’s left of one—a wooden plaque with faded gold letters marking out various wards and offices. Most of the letters are gone now, leaving behind faint outlines and meaningless fragments: *WARD A… DMI… CHILDRE….*



“This way,” Cal says, nodding toward a door just beyond the directory.



I follow him into a narrower hallway, the walls pressing closer now. The floor here is uneven, sagging in places where the wood has rotted through. My flashlight catches more details I wish I hadn’t seen: scratch marks trailing down the plaster, handprints smudged in something dark and dry.



“You think anyone else has been here recently?” I ask, keeping my voice low.



“Probably just other dumbasses like us,” Cal says, but his tone wavers.



We find the staircase at the end of the hall. It’s wide and curving, the kind you’d see in a mansion or an old hotel. The metal railing is warped, rust blooming in jagged patches along its length.



Cal shines his phone light up the steps, revealing a steep climb into pitch darkness. “What do you think’s up there?”



“Nothing good,” I mutter.



He grins, his confidence back in full force. “Then we’d better check it out.”



The stairs groan under our weight as we climb, each step sounding louder than the last. The air grows heavier, colder, the smell sharpening. My flashlight catches glimpses of the walls as we ascend—graffiti layered over old signs, the paint dripping in strange patterns.



Halfway up, Cal stops suddenly.



“What?” I whisper, my chest tight.



He doesn’t answer right away, his head tilted as if he’s listening. The silence stretches out, thick and oppressive, before he finally shakes his head. “Nothing. Thought I heard something.”



I glance over my shoulder, the flashlight beam jittering against the staircase behind us. Nothing. Just shadows.



“We’re almost there,” Cal says, his voice softer now, as if he’s telling himself.



The stairs end at another doorway, this one partially collapsed. We have to squeeze through, the jagged edges of the wood catching at our jackets. Beyond it, the second floor opens up into a long corridor lined with more doors than I can count, each one slightly ajar. The flashlight beams barely pierce the darkness, but what little they reveal is enough to make my skin crawl: splintered door frames, a ceiling dotted with mold, and stains that spread across the floor like black veins.



“Okay,” Cal says, his voice tight with forced cheer, “this is officially creepy.”



The hallway stretches out before us, the walls warped and blistered as if the building itself is sick. Each door we pass feels like a dare, and the open mouths of the rooms beyond seem to breathe faint drafts of cold air.



“Why do they always build places like this to be so damn depressing?” Cal mutters, sweeping his phone light across a cracked sign near one of the doorways.



The faded text reads: Therapy Room 3.



“What, you were expecting rainbows and kittens?” I whisper, even though I don’t know why I’m bothering to stay quiet.



He smirks, shoving the door open. The hinges let out a long, agonized groan, and the flashlight beam skitters over the room.



Inside, it’s a cramped space dominated by a long metal table. The surface is discolored, marred by deep gouges and blackened stains. A few chairs are scattered around the room, some tipped over, their upholstery shredded.



Cal steps closer to the table, his flashlight beam catching something etched into the metal. “Hey, look at this,” he says, leaning down.



I peer over his shoulder. Someone had scratched words into the table, jagged and uneven: *THEY WATCH US.*



“Creepy.” Cal grins, trying to shake off the unease. But I can’t stop looking at the gouges—how they seem frantic, the letters almost stabbing into the metal.



We move on, passing more doors with faded signs: Ward B, Exam Room 4, Storage. Most of them are empty, just peeling wallpaper and broken furniture. The next room catches my attention because of the graffiti scrawled across the wall just inside the doorway: *WHERE IS THE LIGHT?*

I shine my flashlight across the space. It’s larger than the others, with a row of rusty cots pushed against one wall. The remains of tattered sheets drape over the frames like abandoned shrouds. It’s Cal who spots the toy ball, half-hidden beneath one of the cots.



“Guess this confirms it,” he says, nudging it with his foot.



The ball rolls sluggishly, its once-bright colors faded to dull smears. A cartoon face is barely visible on one side, the paint scratched away.



“Kids,” I say softly, the word catching in my throat.



“Guess they had a children’s ward or something.”



The thought settles uneasily in my chest. I can almost hear the faint echoes of laughter that once might’ve filled this room, warped now into something colder, emptier.



The next room is hardly better. The door creaks open under Cal’s weight, revealing a room swallowed by shadows. The air inside is colder, almost damp, and it feels thicker somehow, pressing against my skin like a damp cloth. The flashlight’s beam slices through the dark, catching fragments of a story I don’t want to know: a broken desk with one leg missing, papers scattered in a messy halo across the floor, and graffiti clawed into the peeling plaster. 



Cal steps forward, his boots crunching against the debris. “Looks like someone had a meltdown in here,” he mutters, his voice quieter than usual.



The room smells worse than the others, a mix of mildew and something acrid, like burnt plastic. I stay near the door, my flashlight twitching across the room, looking for—I don’t know what. Nothing about this place feels right.



Cal moves toward the window at the far end, its glass long since shattered. The shards that remain cling stubbornly to the edges of the frame, jagged teeth glinting in the faint moonlight.



He pauses, his phone still angled low. “Hey,” he whispers, his voice taut. “Come here.”



Reluctantly, I approach, stepping carefully over the broken floorboards and scattered paper. Cal doesn’t look at me; his gaze is fixed on the view outside.



“What is it?” I ask.



“Look,” he says, nodding toward the parking lot below.



It takes me a moment to see it, but when I do, my stomach lurches. There’s someone down there, standing near our car.



They’re not doing anything—just standing perfectly still, their silhouette barely visible against the faint glow of the moon. At first, I think it might be the angle, but then I realize how unnaturally straight they’re holding themselves. Their arms hang stiff at their sides, their head cocked slightly to the right, like they’re considering something distant and strange.



“Who the hell is that?” I whisper.



Cal doesn’t answer. He’s leaning forward now, his breath fogging the cracked glass. My heartbeat thuds against my ribs, heavy and irregular.



“Don’t shine the light,” I say quickly, my voice hushed but sharp.



“I wasn’t going to,” Cal replies, though his hand tightens around his phone.



We both stare, not moving, not breathing, as the figure remains frozen. For a moment, I convince myself they’re just some someone from town, maybe a late-night dog walker or someone passing through. No, that’s insane. Why would anyone walk this far? There’s no dog, no movement, no explanation for why they’re standing like that, staring at the ground with such eerie precision.



And then, as if sensing us, the figure tilts its head—just a fraction—and looks up. 



It’s not a slow turn, like you’d expect from someone searching for the source of a noise. It’s sharp, sudden, like a puppet jerked by invisible strings. Their face is still lost in the shadows, but I feel the weight of their gaze, heavy and invasive, like they’re not just seeing us but dissecting us.



“Shit,” Cal breathes, taking a step back.



Before I can reply, the figure moves. Not a slow, hesitant step, but a quick, purposeful stride directly toward the building. Toward us.



“W-what the fuck?,” I whisper, gripping Cal’s arm.



They’re walking faster now, their movements too precise, too deliberate. There’s no pause, no hesitation, like they know exactly where to go.



“They saw us,” Cal says, his voice barely audible.



“No shit!” I hiss, pulling him toward the door. My pulse roars in my ears, every instinct screaming to get out of the room, away from the window, from whatever that thing is.



We stumble into the hallway, the darkness feeling heavier now, as though the building itself knows what’s coming. My flashlight trembles in my grip as I glance back at the room.



Cal’s voice is tight with panic. “We need to move. Now.”



Cal bolts first, his footsteps echoing like gunshots in the stillness of the sanatorium. I scramble after him, my flashlight beam bouncing wildly off the cracked walls and sagging ceiling.



“Where the hell are we going?” I hiss, trying to keep my voice down even as panic claws at my throat.



“Anywhere but here!” Cal snaps back, his voice jagged with fear.



We round a corner too sharply, my shoulder clipping the wall hard enough to make me stumble. The flashlight flickers in my hand, and for one heart-stopping second, the corridor plunges into darkness before the light sputters back to life.



“Wait!” I gasp, trying to catch my breath, but Cal doesn’t slow down.



The hallways all look the same now, an endless maze of rotting doors and crumbling plaster. Every direction feels wrong, but stopping is unthinkable. Somewhere behind us—or maybe ahead of us, or above us, or below us—is that figure. My mind won’t stop replaying the way they moved, stiff and purposeful, like something that had learned to walk but hadn’t quite mastered the art.



“Left!” Cal calls, darting down another hallway.



I follow, the walls narrowing as if the building itself is closing in. The smell here is worse—stale and sickly sweet, like something left to rot for decades.



“Are we even going the right way?” I ask, my voice rising despite myself.



“No idea,” Cal mutters, barely slowing down. His flashlight beam swings across a doorway, and I catch a glimpse of an old gurney overturned in the corner, its wheels rusted and broken.



We keep moving, the sound of our breathing and footsteps the only thing grounding us in the suffocating dark. But even that feels wrong—too loud, too exposed. My ears strain for anything else, any noise that doesn’t belong to us.



A faint clink echoes from somewhere, like metal on metal.



“Did you hear that?” I whisper, my heart thundering.



Cal freezes, and for a moment, all I can hear is the blood rushing in my ears.



Another sound—closer now. A creak, like a footstep on wood.



“Shit,” Cal breathes, grabbing my arm. “We need to move.”



I nod, too terrified to speak, and we take off again.



Somewhere in the distance, I hear a door slam.



Cal slows for just a moment, glancing over his shoulder. “Do you think—”



“Keep going!” I cut him off, shoving him forward. My pulse is a drumbeat in my skull, each step feeling like it could be my last.



We burst into a larger room, the ceiling yawning high above us. The floor is littered with debris—broken tiles, shattered glass, scraps of paper so old they crumble underfoot. Cal’s flashlight swings wildly, catching glimpses of rusted lockers and peeling paint. “What is this place?” he whispers.



I don’t answer. My flashlight beam stops on a door at the far end of the room, slightly ajar. Beyond it, only blackness.



“We can’t just—” I start, but a sound behind us cuts me off. A slow, deliberate tap on the floor, like something testing its weight.



Cal’s eyes widen, and he grabs my wrist, yanking me toward the door. We crash through, into another hallway, this one narrower and colder. I glance back, just for a second, but the space behind us is empty. No figure, no movement. Just darkness swallowing the room.



“Do you think we lost them?” I whisper.



Cal doesn’t answer, his flashlight darting around as we stumble deeper into the building. The air feels thicker, harder to breathe. My chest tightens with every step.



Then, from somewhere far too close, comes the sound of a door creaking open.



“Run,” Cal says, his voice barely audible, and we do.



We round another corner, my lungs burning with every shallow, panicked breath. The faint moonlight filtering through cracks in the walls gives way to deeper darkness, and I realize where we are.



“The entrance,” I gasp, pointing ahead.



Cal’s flashlight sweeps forward, catching the familiar double doors we came through earlier—only something’s wrong.



The doors are blocked.



A massive metal cabinet has been shoved in front of them, its dented surface catching the faint gleam of the beam. Gouges streak across its face, deep and jagged, as if clawed.



Cal stops cold. His breathing sharpens, the flashlight trembling in his grip. “No, no, no,” he mutters, his voice barely audible. “This wasn’t here before.”



Behind us, faint but growing louder, is the sound of footsteps. Deliberate. Measured. Each step sends a jolt through the quiet, echoing off the decaying walls.



“Flashlights off,” Cal whispers, his voice cracking.



I fumble for the switch, plunging us into suffocating darkness. The absence of light feels like a punch to the chest, and my world narrows to the erratic drumbeat of my heart.



Cal grabs my arm and pulls, guiding me toward a broken door hanging half-off its hinges. The metal creaks faintly as he pushes it open just enough for us to slip through. We press ourselves against the farthest wall, wedged between a rusted shelf and a crumbling patch of plaster.



“Don’t move,” he breathes, so close I feel his words against my skin.



The footsteps stop.



The silence stretches taut. I clench my flashlight like it’s the only thing keeping me alive, every muscle in my body screaming to run.



Then—soft, almost imperceptible—the faint clink of chains rattling against the doors.



I strain to listen, the blood pounding in my ears. The air feels charged, like the room itself is holding its breath.



A low, scraping sound follows. Something heavy being dragged across the floor, the noise clawing at my nerves. The footsteps resume, slower now, deliberate, each step pressing the weight of inevitability into the air.



I barely breathe, the faint rustle of fabric and the whisper of steady breathing threading through the quiet.



Through the jagged gap between the broken door and the frame, I see him.



The flashlight didn’t do him justice. He’s tall, his frame skeletal, every movement stiff and wrong. His head tilts unnaturally as he steps closer, like he’s calibrating to the space. The faint shuffle of his feet against the floor is excruciating.



Then I see what he’s carrying.



In his hand is a bundle. Pale, fleshy strands twist and coil like veins torn from the earth, too alive in the dim light. Thick droplets of dark liquid splatter onto the floor as he moves, each one landing with a wet *plop*.



I bite my cheek hard. My chest tightens, breath coming shallow and fast.



The figure stops.



He’s no more than a dozen feet away, the twisted bundle swinging gently in his hand. His head tilts sharply, listening—or sensing. The movement is abrupt, mechanical, as if his body isn’t entirely his own. The seconds stretch into an eternity.



Then, with sudden precision, his head snaps toward the hallway on the left. Without a sound, he starts walking, the scraping and dripping fading as he disappears into the shadows.



The room is silent again, the air so thick I feel like I’m drowning in it.



Cal’s breath brushes against my ear. “What the hell was that?”



I shake my head, my throat too tight to speak.



Cal tugs my sleeve and points to the far side of the room. One of the windows, its glass long shattered, gapes open like a crooked mouth. The jagged edges of the remaining panes glint faintly in the moonlight. It’s high—too high to just step through—but there’s a broken chair beneath it, its frame barely holding together.



“We can make it,” he whispers, his voice barely audible over the hammering of my pulse.



I nod, my throat too tight to speak. Every step toward the window feels drawn out, the groaning floorboards beneath us loud as gunshots in the suffocating quiet.



Cal reaches the chair first, testing it with cautious fingers. It wobbles under his touch but holds. He glances back at me, urgency written in the tightness of his jaw. “You first.”



“No,” I mouth, shaking my head.



“Just go,” he hisses, his eyes darting to the doorway.



I hesitate, then grip the window frame, ignoring the tiny shards of glass biting into my palms. My foot finds the chair, which creaks under even my weight. I push up, hoisting myself toward the cool breath of the night outside. The air smells damp, earthy.



“Almost there,” Cal mutters, steadying the chair beneath me.



I swing one leg through the opening, careful to avoid the jagged edges. The damp grass outside is soft under my knee as I prepare to pull the rest of my body through.



That’s when I hear it. Fast. Sharp. Bare feet smacking frantically against tile, growing louder, closer. I freeze, half through the window, the sound rushing toward us with terrifying speed.



“Go!” Cal hisses, his voice cutting through the growing noise.



I heave myself outside, landing hard on the damp ground. I turn to peer through the broken window, barely able to see in the dark. Cal is climbing now, scrambling with hurried movements, his flashlight tucked under his arm. “Come on,” I urge, my voice barely above a whisper.



Then, from the gloom, the sound stops. The silence is worse.



“Cal—” I start, but the words catch in my throat.



A sharp, jerking shadow shifts behind him.



“Cal!”



The figure bursts forward, a blur of limbs and jerky, mechanical movements. Its bare feet slap the floor with sickening speed, closing the distance in a heartbeat. Cal twists just as it lunges, its pale bundle swinging like a grotesque pendulum. He kicks out blindly, his foot connecting with its chest. The figure staggers back with a low, guttural grunt.



“Shit!” Cal gasps, his legs flailing as he hauls himself through the window. The chair beneath him collapses with a splintering crack, glass shards raining down as he lands hard beside me.



I grab his arm, pulling him upright, but my eyes are drawn back to the window.



The figure is there, its head tilting into the moonlight. It presses close to the broken pane, one hand resting lightly against the jagged glass, as though testing it. It doesn’t climb through. It just watches.



“Run,” Cal says, his voice barely more than a breath.



We bolt, the wet grass dragging at our feet as we sprint toward the car. Every nerve in my body screams at me to look back, but I can’t. Our breaths tear through the air, loud and ragged, mingling with the distant rustle of leaves and the faint sound of our footsteps crunching gravel. We reach the car, fumbling with the doors. My fingers feel numb as I yank mine open and throw myself inside. Cal slams into the driver’s seat, stabbing the keys into the ignition with shaking hands.



The engine roars to life, the headlights flaring on.



I scream.



He’s standing right in front of the car, perfectly still.



In the stark light, he looks human, an oversized brown coat hanging loosely about the shoulders, his jeans splattered with mud, bare toes gripping the earth. His thin frame casts a spindly shadow, his head tilted just slightly, as if curious; the eyes are cold, steely grey, unblinking, his face fringed with a tangled black beard streaked with silver. The pale bundle hangs limply at his side, dripping onto the gravel. His head tilts slowly, and his lips twitch, almost like he’s trying to smile but has forgotten how.



“What the fuck?” Cal breathes, his hands frozen on the wheel.



The figure shifts, one jerky step forward, his hand twitching as if it might reach for the hood of the car.



Cal doesn’t wait. He slams the gas, the tires screeching as the car lurches forward. The figure doesn’t move, standing motionless as we swerve past him and onto the dirt road. We rocket past, the world outside blurring into shadows and streaks of moonlight. Cal’s hands grip the wheel like a vice, his knuckles white, his jaw clenched tight.



I twist in my seat, looking back, but the road behind us is empty.



“He’s gone,” I murmur, though I don’t believe it for a second.



Cal doesn’t respond. He just keeps driving, the tires humming against the asphalt, the engine roaring louder than ever in the dead silence of the night.



The road stretches before us like a ribbon unraveling into the dense forest, the car’s headlights carving weak tunnels of light through the darkness. Every bump and scrape of the gravel beneath the tires echoes in my head, amplified by the suffocating silence between Cal and me. 



Cal’s jaw is set tight, his knuckles ghostly against the steering wheel, his breathing shallow. He hasn’t said a word since we bolted out of the sanatorium, and I couldn’t blame him. My own throat feels like it was glued shut, my mind running in endless circles, trying to make sense of what I’d seen—or thought I’d seen.



I slump back in my seat, running a shaky hand through my hair. The smell of mildew from the sanatorium clings to my hoodie, sharp and sour, and I rubbed my hands together as if I could scrub it off. “You okay?” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.



Cal’s lips twitch, but he doesn’t look at me. “What do you think?”



“Fair point.” I bite my lip, looking out the window. The trees blurr past in dark smudges, their shapes twisting in the corners of my vision. I tell myself it was just my imagination, but the shadows feel alive, like they are creeping closer every second.



“You saw him, right?” Cal finally asks.



I nod, staring straight ahead. “Yeah.”



“And what he was holding…?” He trails off, his words hanging in the air like smoke.



“I don’t know,” I say quickly, cutting him off. I don’t want to say it out loud. Can’t. But the image wouldn’t leave me: that pale, limp shape, dripping in the moonlight.



Cal’s jaw clenches tighter. “Looked like—”



“Don’t,” I snap, more forcefully than I mean. “Just… don’t, okay?”



For once, he didn’t argue.



The stop sign appears ahead, its dull red surface catching the glow of the headlights. Relief washes over me, a fragile, fleeting thing. Beyond that sign is the highway—civilization, safety, light. I lean forward, willing the car to go faster.



Cal slows instead, easing off the gas. His fingers tap nervously on the wheel.



“What are you doing?”



“Stopping, like you’re supposed to at a stop sign,” he mutters, though his voice lacks its usual sarcasm.



As the car rolls to a stop, I catch a glimpse of movement in the rearview mirror—and my stomach drops. At first, I think it is just the trees shifting in the breeze. But no. They are too still. Too deliberate.



Figures.



They stand at the edge of the treeline, just where the gravel road meets the forest, bathed in faint moonlight. At least a dozen of them. Maybe more.



I can’t make out their faces—if they even have faces. Their silhouettes are jagged and wrong, their limbs at odd angles, their bodies leaning slightly, like they are caught mid-motion. Some are hunched and twisted, others impossibly thin.



“Cal,” I say, my voice barely audible.



He glances at me, frowning. “What?”



“Look,” I whisper, pointing to the mirror.



His eyes dart up. “Jesus Christ,” he breathes, his voice cracking. His foot lifts off the brake, and the car creeps forward a few inches.



“They’re just standing there,” I whisper, more to myself than to him.



The figures don’t move. Their stillness feels wrong, like they aren’t just watching, but waiting.



Then, as if responding to some invisible cue, their heads turn. All at once. Their necks twist sharply, too fast, the motion jerky and unnatural. Every head snaps to the left, their gazes locking. I can’t see what they are looking at - all there is in that direction is trees, the road, and…



The sanatorium. Even through the dense brush and forest, somehow, I know that that is where they are looking. I clutch the seat, my chest tight. 



“What are they doing?”



“Not our problem,” Cal says, his voice trembling as he presses the gas.



The car lurches forward, the gravel spitting under the tires, and I twist in my seat to keep watching. The figures don’t follow. They stay rooted at the edge of the trees, their heads still angled towards the growing dark.



Cal’s grip on the wheel tightens, his knuckles bloodless. “Don’t tell anyone,” he says suddenly, his voice sharp.



I blink. “What?”



“About what we saw. About them. Don’t tell anyone. Not yet.”



I want to argue, but the words catch in my throat. Deep down, I know he’s right. Who would believe us?



I stare out the window, watching the shadows dissolve into the dark, but no matter how far we drive, I can’t shake the weight in my chest. It’s not just fear—that sharp, primal terror that clawed at me back there. It’s something quieter, heavier, like a thread wound tight around my ribs, pulling, tugging.



Cal’s knuckles are white on the steering wheel, his breath uneven in the silence. I want to say something, but the words catch, tangled in the same weight that’s making it hard to breathe. My thoughts circle back to the figures at the treeline, to the way their heads moved. Maybe they were just homeless people? Or maybe they were all on drugs? But… even then, I don’t know any drug that causes that. And the bundle… even with the safety of the highway, I can still hear the dripping. 



The shadows outside blur into the night, but something lingers. A sense of being tethered. A faint rhythm, like a heartbeat, pulsing faintly in the back of my mind. It’s almost imperceptible, a strange, half-felt echo. I grip my knees to stop my hands from shaking, but the unease doesn’t leave. The highway stretches ahead, empty and endless, but the further we get, the more my chest tightens. I tell myself it’s over, that we’re safe, but the thought rings hollow, like saying it out loud would somehow shatter it.



And then it hits me, cold and certain: *I’m not afraid. Not exactly.*



Because deep down, beneath the pounding in my chest and the static in my head, something is pulling. A thread, an idea, a whisper—so faint I almost miss it. Sooner or later, willingly or not, I know one simple truth about what happened.



*We have to go back.*
