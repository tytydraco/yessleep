I'm minding my business in class, and then I hear a thump to my left. My friend Lucas pulls the chair in as he sits down. We do the usual "yo wassup" and then he opens his laptop and gets to work. A few minutes pass when I feel my phone vibrate. I only have notifications on for social media so maybe someone messaged me. We aren't allowed to have our phones on us and they get confiscated if found so I just take a brief peek while my teacher is looking the other way. I see a picture of Lucas in his living room with a milkshake watching the football. I'm about to ask him about it but something tells me I should keep it to myself.

I'm feeling a little weirded out but I get back to work. I'm nearly done when my phone goes off again and this time I can clearly see the game. Swans vs Giants, the points are: Swans with 21, Giants with 18. I don't know much about AFL, let alone any sport, but I do know that you can watch live in class. So I check the game. Swans with 21, Giants with 19. It can't be an old photo. This is happening now. I look to my left. What is sitting next to me? it hasn't seen what I'm looking at, so it thinks it's still undiscovered.

I ask the teacher if I can go to the toilet. As I go through the hall I pass a bunch of classes and realise that there could be any number of these things impersonating students. People could be in danger. I get to the toilet and take out my phone, I send Lucas a PM on insta "yo you at home". He sends back almost immediately: "yea bro im sick asl". I catch him up on the situation and he asks me to get a photo of the thing in my classroom.

I'm outside the room but it's not a good spot, tons of windows to other classrooms with teachers who could see. I just have to go back into class. I tell him what happened and he's not buying it. He says "ik you js playin with me bro". I try to convince him but it's not happening. I message him "should be able to get photo after school ends". It makes me nauseous sitting next to whatever that thing is, constantly on edge in case it tries anything. It even speaks to me a few times. I just go along with it and then get back to work.

Finally the bell rings and I leave class as fast as I can. I pack all my stuff into my bag, lock up and go. I catch a picture of that thing on my way out and send it to Lucas. He sends me "damn bro u weren't lying" "come to my place" "now". So I get the addy and head over. Constantly I'm looking over my shoulder in case it's following me, but I seem to be okay. I'm approaching the house and see Lucas waiting out front. He just looks at me, a solemn expression on his face and says "Come inside bro".

In Lucas's room, he asks me "what do you think it is?" and I say "I really don't know. It could be an alien, it could be a skinwalker. It was exactly like you." It looks as though the reality of the situation is just setting in for him. His eyes widen, but something else is wrong. I consider his eyes again. The colour is just a tad off. My stomach drops, and only now do I realise I had it the wrong way around from the start.

How could I have been so stupid?
