The actual term is called immurement. As a form of punishment, the person got buried alive, but not like in a coffin. Usually, they were buried in walls and instead of dying of lack of air, they would die from starvation and dehydration. An awful way to die. So, when I moved into my new place and one of the neighbors told me this, I couldn’t believe it.

“A nun was buried alive in one of the walls inside this home?”

“Yes, but nobody knows exactly where she was buried,” they responded.

I should mention that the place I moved into was ancient. The city had been around for over seven hundred years. Castle walls and a mote surrounded the whole city center. The place I rented resided behind these walls.

I moved there for work and loved the idea of relocating to a Medieval city. I worked for an art supply company that kept a mega factory there.

I did some research and couldn’t find anything about this nun. An ancient monastery that practiced immurement had resided nearby. Presently, it became the town’s historical society building. My place must have been a part of it. Usually, this punishment befell the ones who broke vows of chastity.

This really pained me as I had been alone for many years. Human alone. Not cat alone. I had an all-white, five-year-old cat named Ben.

To think this could happen to somebody just because they wanted to be touched by another intimately. There’s something about close human connections. The feel of another person’s skin. Their smell. Their breath. I had missed it very much. I had been alone mostly –okay entirely– by my own doing, for quite some time. 

I had been too ambitious with my career. Not bragging, as it obviously came with lots of sacrifices, but I had made a great amount of money.  

I had dated a few people who also said that I was detached and indifferent. I didn’t even understand what that truly meant… I had been putting off seeing a therapist for years. I wasn’t cold-hearted. I love Ben. He’s my child. My baby boy. I used to take him to work with me and regretted that I stopped doing that. 

I also took this new job because I didn’t have to work as many hours. I’d have more time to work on myself. But when I got to my new office, that didn’t pan out immediately. My assistant retired right before I started, leaving me to have to replace her and do the extra workload.

I must have worked thirty, long days straight. I felt bad leaving Ben in new surroundings, but unlike my old office, they didn’t allow pets at the factory. Our home had huge window. One of the reasons I picked it. Ben loves to bathe in the Sun. So, at least he had that.

I tried to play with him when I’d get home, but exhaustion always got the best of me. Oddly, he seemed content. Usually by the time I get home, he’s pretty frisky. Even in my old place, where I had someone come by and check on him daily, he’d still have lots of energy when I returned.

I always had a camera in our place so I could check on him. During this time, I noticed that he played a lot during the day. I’d see him running around the house, like we do, kind of like a hide and seek game which he loves. I would also see him jumping and throwing his toys around. Which he never did before when he was alone. It brought me joy to see him having so much fun in our new home.

This should have been the first red flag. 

Meanwhile, I asked a lot of people about the buried nun. I just had to know and wondered why nobody had unburied her yet. It seemed a bit messed up. 

Only the oldest neighbors knew. But not much. I even went to the historical society. Unfortunately, their best historian went on leave for two months. 

I asked a grouchy woman there who responded, “why does a young man care about the old bones of nuns? Sounds like he needs a social life.” She didn’t know much.

I asked my landlord who said, “it’s phony baloney. This is just bad stories they told to keep the nuns in line.” He was such a liar about everything.

I withheld from him that if I did find her, I would tell the historical society and they would exhume her remains. 

On my first two days off, I started searching for the nun. I’m an idiot who can’t let things go. I become a bit obsessive. When I had something in mind, I dove in until the switch in my mind turned off. 

I fully made this a team effort and forced Ben to do this with me. 

I bought an expensive, 3D radiofrequency imaging device. Not to get too nerdy, but different wave lengths of electromagnetic waves can penetrate different objects. So, if something was buried in the wall, even through thick stone, you could see its energy wave on the device. It’s amazing technology. 

I only half expected to find her. 

I started scanning the walls, floors, and ceilings. Room by room. A couple walls had extra layers of plaster that I had to scrape off with a knife so I could angle into corners better. After a long day, I found nothing. 

We still had the small courtyard in the back, the cellar, and attic to do. 

That night, I played with Ben and noticed he’d stare off into the distance at times. He even seemed to follow something down the hallway at one point. 

After we went to bed, I woke up around 2AM. I heard something. A rustling in the hallway. It had to be Ben poking around some moving boxes. 

I then heard a few creaks. Everything creaked on those old wood floors. Yet the creaks sounded like the footsteps of a person. 

I got up and snatched the baseball bat that I keep next to my bed.

As I probed, I saw a shadow stir around a corner that led into the kitchen. I froze. The place became extremely cold. I could see my breath.

The shadow then seemed to untangle from itself into spindly drifts of black smoke as it turned the corner. I readied my bat. But then oddly, the shadow vanished just like that.

I scanned the area, rubbing sleep out of my eyes. 

I lumbered into the kitchen. Through the window, a partial moon hung in the sky. Its light spilled in. I thought to myself, something must have passed by outside. This window overlooked a bustling, cobblestone thoroughfare during the day.

Yet, at that moment, I sensed a presence standing right behind me. Very close. The hair on my neck stood up as I swear, I felt an ice-cold breath. But when I spun around, I didn’t find anything.

I didn’t know what to think and went back to bed.

The next morning, I started in the cellar, the creepiest space in the house. A set of wood stairs led down to a murky, stone basement. No windows. One dim light. It only stood about five-foot tall. Someone left some bags of rotten potatoes down there.

I thought for sure I would find something. The cellar looked like a dungeon. Yet, I found nothing. 

I did the attic next. There were no light fixtures but a small vent where some daylight spilled in. Dust floated in the air giving the sunlight a creepy glow. There were about a half dozen wood support columns which made the dark corners even darker.

Ben didn’t come up with me. The attic was hard to get to. You had to enter a closet, climb up a small step ladder, to pull yourself onto a shelf, so you could then crawl into the attic through a flip door in the ceiling.

I clicked on my phone-light to enhance the weak sliver of sunlight from the vent. I set my phone down nearby, treating it like a lantern. I then scanned the walls with the imaging device. After some time, something flashed across my screen. Something shaped like a foot long pipe with wider nubs on each side.

It looked like a human bone.

Abruptly, a swift breeze blew through the vent and the attic door slammed shut. I found myself in complete darkness except for that sliver of sunlight and my phone which still lay on the ground. 

I tried to open the door. It was totally sealed. I pulled my knife to get more leverage. 

But then a thin, freezing hand slid into mine and tugged. I turned to behold – a set of piercing, angry eyes embedded in pale skin staring up at me. I yanked my hand back, stumbled, and kicked my phone. The light went out.

I screamed and quickly stepped into the sunlight. I eyeballed the darkness around me. Nothing stirred. I scooped up my phone, clicked the light back on, and scanned the shadows. Hoping I wouldn’t find anything. 

I scanned the first corner. Then the second. My nerves amping up. I felt my heart pounding. I then scanned the third. I then got to the last darkest corner… And held my breath. 

But nothing was there. The phantom, gone.

I used my knife to pry open the attic door and quickly fled.

That night, I took Ben for a walk. We don’t do this enough. I leashed him up and we went trekking. I had to get out of that house.

We walked to one of the draw bridges that had been converted to a permanent stone walkway. The mote, a charming river now, snaked into a small lake nearby. 

My instincts were of course to get the hell out of there. Find a different place and hope that thing doesn’t follow. Yet, as I watched Ben stare at the birds nesting in the castle walls, I thought to myself that maybe this nun just wanted to be rescued. 

One of my lifelong desires was to prove to myself that ghosts really exist. I always had a morbid fascination. I had never had an encounter. And what an encounter this was.

Those angry eyes tortured me, though. They were menacing. A massive red flag that I should have heeded. My common-sense instincts were shit from working in the corporate world for so long. I always tried to find the positive in the negative.

I could have gotten a motel room that night. An Airbnb. Hell, I could have even slept in my car. But I went back. When we returned, I opened the front door and waited to see what Ben would do. He ran inside with no hesitation. I thought, “we got this, and we can do some good here. A win-win situation.”

The closet that held the entrance to the attic stood right outside my bedroom door. I closed the door to the closet and secured it with a chair as if ghosts couldn’t pass through closed doors.

I bunkered down in the living room right by the quickest escape, the front door. As I lay there, I couldn’t sleep. I studied the shadows all night. Ben peacefully slept next to me.

The next day, I called out sick from work. I went to the historical society and asked the grouchy woman if she could please call the person who was out and ask them if they can call me. She said, “I’ll pass along the message, my liege.” 

I then told her that I had found the nun’s remains in my attic. This got her attention. I then detailed how and what I had found. I also told her about my encounter. 

She didn’t seem surprised and only said, “the city is very mature and so are its ghosts.” She asked if I would be able to scan the attic again and take pictures of the displays on the imaging device. They would want to exhume but just needed to do so in an official capacity which requires lots of evidence. 

Unfortunately, they could not provide any assistance to help with this when I asked.

I went home. Opened the closet door and stared up at the attic. I really thought I was doing something admirable. I really thought that what happened to the nun was one of the worst crimes done to a human being and needed to be fixed. And the faster I could fix it, the better.

Yet, those angry eyes haunted me. Why did they look so angry? 

I then went up to the attic again. Only this time, I ran an extension cord up there and brought an ultra-bright work light.

I then imaged the wall again. I found more bones. And then a skull. I could see it so clearly. I absorbed this ancient human skull just on the other side of the stone wall from me. It appeared so small and delicate.

I then heard a creak and quickly turned around.

I stared into the darkness for an eternity. Nothing stirred. Nonetheless, I felt compelled to say, “we’re going to take you out of this place. And my hope is that you will finally find peace.” I got no response.

That night, I lay in my bedroom and thought to myself that the next day I would call out sick again and exhume her bones myself. I could already see all the red tape that the historical society would have to go through.

I kept the closet door closed and secured with a chair. I also kept my bedroom door closed. Somehow, even with all this rattling around in my mind, I fell asleep.

I don’t know the exact time, but when I woke up, I recoiled as a dark shadow loomed at the foot of my bed. Its shape, feminine. It then walked out of my room.

My door stood wide open now. Ben sat outside it. The closet door to the attic stood right behind him. This door was also wide open now. 

The thing then strode across the hall, right by Ben, and into the closet and vanished in its pitch blackness.

Ben then turned and followed it in.

I sat up. My hands clutching my blanket.

I stopped breathing, my mind racing. I just lay there, not knowing what to do. My adrenaline kicked in. 

I got up and creaked to the closet. I called out, “Ben, come here, boy.” The place dropped in temperature. I turned the hallway light on. But the light didn’t work. I tried some other lights. They didn’t work either.

I snatched my phone and used its light. Ben was not in the closet.

I put on my jacket and shoes and grabbed my knife. I then climbed up to the attic door. It gaped wide open, like some kind of large beast’s mouth.

I took a deep breath and crawled inside. Once in, I kicked down on the attic door causing one of its hinges to break and the wood around it to snap and crack apart. I did this so if the door closed again, it would be easy to open.

The moon cast a feeble light, so a rich, creepy darkness spread across the attic. Its extreme cold gave me shivers. My phone light scanned the blackness.

I jumped when my light hit Ben lying on the floor. He saw me and his head tilted. Something stirred behind him in the deeper shadows beyond the wood columns. 

I thought about shining my light there, but I didn’t want to see what I would find. 

I said to Ben, “come here… come on, boy…” He would sometimes come when I call him. But not this time. He seemed at ease and started washing his paws.

I could hear floorboards creaking behind him. A dark silhouette shifted against the blackness.

“Do you want to hurt me?” I cried out.

After a long moment, I didn’t get any response. Creak, creak, creak. The thing shuffled to the other dark corner. I then said, “please, I want to help you.” Just then, this primordial shriek, guttural and angry, ripped through the air. It sounded like a, “NO!” The force of it knocked me against the wall so hard that I thought I had broken my shoulder.

My phone fell on the ground. Its screen shattered.

Ben jumped to his feet. His ears pointed. He was on high alert. 

I then heard the attic door close with a nasty crunch.

I yelled, “no, no!” and ran to the attic door. I tried to open it but heard the wood crunch even more. I didn’t know what it did, but I couldn’t open the door. I tried my knife as before, but I couldn’t get any leverage. The door was wedged in so tight.

I then kicked it over and over, but the damn thing wouldn’t budge. It was as if the ceiling was pinched together there.

I sat down. I wanted to cry. This thing just locked us in the attic.

I tried to use my phone. But with its screen shattered, it was unusable. Believe me, I tried a lot.

The first day trapped in there, I screamed, yelled, and banged but nobody heard me. I couldn’t reach the vent and used my knife to scrape into the attic door. But the old, dense wood may have well been cement. 

The second day, Ben cried and wailed, breaking my heart into pieces. I think he finally understood our situation. We had no food or water. I had the worst headache and felt my head would explode. Nausea hit hard, but I had nothing to throw up. 

The third day, Ben looked bad. He had gotten very skinny and stopped moving. He sprawled on his side on the floor panting. I lay next to him, sobbing but no tears came out. 

I felt my whole body drying up. My insides cramped. My skin cracked. My mouth felt like sandpaper. My eyes scratched against their lids.

The pain was the worst I had ever felt. 

At some point, I think I became delirious as I started having visions. 

I saw a nun in her twenties, in her full black and white habit. She was getting buried in the wall by a priest and two men. Her hands and feet were bound. She screamed. Another nun read verses from a book.

I yelled out, “What is wrong with you! Why are you doing this!”

We were then alone for some time when Ben started convulsing. I was just about to lose all hope when I heard the voice downstairs. “Hello?” I yelled and screamed at the top of my lungs. I had no energy, but the last drops of my adrenaline kicked in. Somebody heard and ran over. I heard them, “hello, it’s me, is that you?” It was my landlord. “It’s me,” I said! “I’m trapped up here! Please help, my cat is dying!” 

He then broke us out with a crowbar from his car. My work had called him as I hadn’t showed up for days. I had put him down as one of my emergency contacts.

He drove me to the animal hospital as I drank a gallon of water and forced some into Ben’s mouth. 

“A miracle, an absolute miracle” exclaimed the vet. Ben survived with no severe damage to his organs. When I heard this, I cried so much I couldn’t cry anymore. 

I then passed out and spent the next day in the hospital.

After I woke and they released me, I quit my job, packed up as quickly as possible, and moved back to my hometown. Those days were a bit of a whirlwind as I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

Now, I just want to focus on myself and Ben.

Ben is not the same. He’s a little standoffish. I know that I failed him, but I will forever be trying to make it up to him. I also adopted another cat, so he’d have another friend. They are best buddies.

I’m not the same either. I’m a little off as well. I started seeing a therapist. I realized how much I need human connection.

I did give the historical society the images I had found. They will exhume the nun’s remains. I hope good will come of it. Their master historian also called me. I may call back. Or I may not.

As for the place we now call home, I found a nice little house that was newly built with not much history. Nonetheless, I don’t sleep well at night. I can’t stop seeing the images.
