Sometimes when I’m drifting off to sleep, I hear the strangest sounds in my house. At first, it was just little scratches and creaks. I dismissed them as old house sounds, or only in my mind as I’m halfway into a dream. But the more I listened, the creepier they became. The noises even seemed to be moving around my house. One night, right as I laid down in bed, I heard a low voice growling. I shot up, “Who’s there?!” Silence.

I stood perfectly still for ages, listening intently. But now it was dead quiet. I pulled my phone out of my purse and started to dial the police. But I then thought about it for a moment. An image rushed in my mind of the police swarming down here to confront what turned out to just be some rats or a wandering squirrel. I instead decided to call an exterminator.

“Blackthorn Pest Control, how can I help you?”

“Hi, I’ve been hearing some weird noises coming from my house lately. Scratching sounds in the walls, and I thought I just heard something growling.”

“I see. And have you noticed any visual signs, ma’am? Have you seen any scratches or droppings, any food gone missing or anything like that?”

“Yes actually,” I gulped as I realized, “I thought I had some leftovers the other day but when I went to check, they were gone.”

“Leftovers?” The man’s voice wavered. “As in inside your fridge?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Is that weird?”

“Uh… let me tell you what. Gimme your address and phone number, and we can send someone down there on Tuesday to take a look around.”

I gave him my information and hung up the phone. The confusion in his voice at the end had me even more worried. I reached back into my purse and pulled out a can of pepper spray. I wasn’t sure how well it would work against an animal, but I gripped it tightly in case of something larger lurking. I checked every room of the house, which didn’t take long. It was only a two-bedroom rental, with the second being used as an office. I searched both rooms, then the kitchen and all the cupboards. Nothing.

I slowly crept into the final room, the bathroom. I inched toward the shower curtain with my heart racing, pepper spray ready in my other hand, and yanked the curtain to the side… Still nothing.

I let out a heavy breath and felt like a moron getting worked up for nothing. I went back into my room and sat on the bed. But as I sat there in deep thought, the closet door caught my eye. It wasn’t fully closed. I shuddered. I could swear it was closed before I left the room. My heart rate jumped back up as I clutched the pepper spray. *There was no way, right?*

I slowly walked toward the door and yanked it open. All that was inside were my clothes and a few stacks of boxes from moving in. I hadn’t finished unpacking, so most of my stuff was still in those boxes. I pushed some of them aside to check the corners of the closet for signs of rodents, but something else made me stop dead in my tracks.

At the back of the closet, there was a small panel in the wall. It was so thin and subtle that I had never noticed it before. I pressed it in. It slid back to open a secret compartment. A rancid smell hit me first, like sweat and rotting food. Then, from the darkness, something shifted. A hand. No, fingers, curling around the edge of the hole. My breath caught as a pair of sunken eyes met mine.

A lanky and scraggly-bearded man slowly crawled out of the hole. He glared up at me with a demented smile. I screamed again and dropped the pepper spray. I turned and ran out of the room, down the hallway, and out the front door. I kept running and screaming through the grass and past my neighbors until my throat and legs were sore. The image of the dirty, old man’s smile was permanently burned into my mind.

Later, the police told me that the homeless man had been secretly living in my house for weeks. He somehow found a way in undetected. I moved far away and tried to forget all about that place and that man. Many months passed, but I struggled to sleep at night even in my new, safer neighborhood with a home security system. I told myself it was over, that it was a once in a lifetime horrific event. But last night, I woke to a soft creak from my closet door. It was open—just an inch.
