Reine and I watch as Xuan and Lockhart exit the diner. They exchange a brief nod, the weight of their conversation evident in their gestures. Lockhart heads towards a sleek, black sedan while Xuan moves in the opposite direction.

"We can't tail both," Reine murmurs, her eyes darting between the two.

I drum my fingers on the steering wheel, contemplating the decision. "It isn't a cheap horror movie. We're not splitting up."

Reine smirks, though her face remains tense. "Who do we follow?"

I take a moment to consider our options. Lockhart, while intriguing, is an unknown variable. On the [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGd1F6Ay8ho) hand, based on his conversation with her, Xuan sounds like he's planning something imminent. The urgency in his voice, the sense of purpose — it all points to immediate action.

“We’ll stick to Xuan,” I decide hurriedly, my voice low. “But we can’t just let her go. She’s...” I falter, struggling to articulate the unnerving encounter we’d just witnessed.

“A piece of the puzzle we can’t afford to ignore,” Reine finishes for me, her voice steady despite the lingering fear in her eyes.

Reine’s eyes dart to Lockhart, watching her walk towards a sleek, dark-tinted vehicle. “You still have that tracker from the Landry case?” she asks, already formulating a plan in her head.

“I do.” I retrieve a small, coin-sized tracking device from the glove compartment. “But how do you plan on planting it?”

She smirks, mischief dancing in her eyes despite the weight of the situation. “We’re in Uptown. It’s a bright day, and there are couples strolling everywhere. We’ll blend in.”

Using the crowd to our advantage, we exit the car and meander towards Lockhart's vehicle. Reine takes the lead, her arm casually looped around mine. To any onlooker, we’re just a couple out for a leisurely walk.

As Reine is about to attach the tracker, a voice calls out from behind us, startling both of us.

As we approach Lockhart's car, I feel the tension in Reine's grip on my arm. Every step is calculated, her eyes constantly scanning for an opening. The tracker is subtly palmed in her hand, ready for the opportune moment.

But just as Reine is about to make her move, a voice calls out from behind us. "Excuse me, miss?"

We both freeze. Turning around, we see Lockhart standing a few steps away, an unreadable expression on her face. She's holding an indigo scarf in her hand, extending it towards Reine. "I believe you dropped this."

Reine quickly regains her composure, a surprised and grateful smile flashing across her face. “Oh, my God! Thank you so much!” Reine quickly replies, feigning a thick New York accent, her voice filled with exaggerated gratitude. “I’d hate to come back from vacation and find out I lost it!”

As she reaches out to take the scarf, her fingers deftly slide the tracker back into her pocket, the opportunity to plant it now lost. Lockhart's gaze flickers between us, a hint of suspicion lurking in her icy blue eyes.

I quickly catch on, and chiming in, I add, “Thanks, ma’am. Always losin’ something, this one. Can't take her anywhere!” My voice is thick with the Bronx twang, striving to mask any recognizable traits of my true voice.

"You're welcome," Lockhart replies, her voice as smooth as silk. "Be more careful next time. It's a beautiful piece."

Reine nods, wrapping the scarf around her neck. "I certainly will. Thank you again."

Lockhart gives us a curt nod before turning back towards her car. As we watch the car disappear into the distance, the weight of the moment pressing heavily upon us.

Despite failing to plant the tracker, we breath a sigh of relief knowing we didn't raise Lockhart's suspicions. Sometimes, in the shadowy world of private investigation, an unnoticed failure is the next best thing to a quiet victory.

"That was too close," I murmur as we walk back to our car.Reine glances at the retreating vehicle, a thoughtful look on her face. "We need to be more careful. She's not someone to underestimate."

—

As we return to our car, I key the ignition, and with a glance at Reine, we set off, trailing Xuan’s older model sedan. The route is winding and filled with unexpected turns, leading us away from the bustling neighborhoods of New Orleans and toward the industrialized outskirts. Reine keeps a keen eye on our surroundings, while I maintain a discreet distance behind Xuan.

Soon, we find ourselves near the mouth of Mississippi River, where dilapidated warehouses and rusting factories paint a bleak image of an industry long forgotten. Xuan’s car slows and eventually parks near an old factory, seemingly abandoned.

The factory, a mammoth structure made of old red bricks, is imprinted with faded lettering spelling out “Creole Cotton Mills,” hinting at its former glory days. Towering chimneys stretch upwards, and large windows, some broken, punctuate the building.

We park a few blocks away to avoid being spotted, making our way on foot. The heavy scent of the Mississippi fills the air, mixed with a faint, metallic odor that I can't quite place.

“We need to get a closer look,” I whisper, pointing towards a side entrance. We make our way stealthily, avoiding the scarce light from the lampposts.

We approach the side entrance, but it's locked and appears to be reinforced. Given the noise that breaking it down would make, it’s not a viable option. I scan the surrounding area and my eyes catch a broken window on the upper floor, large enough for someone to crawl through, but high enough to be a challenge.

Using a discarded wooden crate, we manage to boost ourselves up. I take the lead, carefully pulling myself up and through the shattered window. A few jagged edges scratch my forearm, but I manage to land softly on the other side.

Reaching down, I extend my hand to help pull Reine up. Within moments, we’re both inside, concealed in the shadows of the abandoned factory.

The ambiance inside the factory is heavy, with years of stagnation and decay palpable in the air. The cavernous space is filled with the silhouettes of old, rusting machinery; remnants of a bygone era. I take a moment to adjust to the dim lighting, the soft glow of the moon filtering through broken windows providing minimal illumination.

Patting my jacket pocket, I take comfort in feeling the solid weight of my concealed carry against my side. With potential dangers unknown, it’s a small but significant reassurance.

Reine gestures toward the center of the factory. From our vantage point, we can see strange symbols drawn on the floor, encircling a raised platform. Tools, wires, and strange pieces of machinery are strewn about. This isn’t a random gathering of discarded junk; someone had been working here, crafting something large and intricate.

We make our way towards the far end of the factory. There, we spot deep tire tracks, suggesting that something massive was recently moved from this location. Following the tracks, they lead towards large, reinforced doors that open out towards the river.

Curiosity piqued, we carefully move closer. Upon inspection, the doors show recent signs of activity, with fresh scuff marks and faint residues of a luminescent substance smeared on the edges.

I kneel, examining the tracks more closely. These aren’t just any tracks. I look at the weight distribution. Whatever was moved from here, it was colossal, and it wasn’t standard machinery.

The remnants of a hasty operation are strewn everywhere. Scattered amongst the old factory machinery are smashed electronics and shards of devices that were purposefully destroyed. Piles of ash dot the ground, suggesting the recent burning of documents. I approach one such pile, sifting through the charred remnants with a gloved hand.

Among the discarded blueprints and charred remains of paper, a glint catches my eye. I carefully brush aside the ash, picking up a half-burned photograph, the edges blackened and brittle to the touch. The image is clear in the center, revealing a younger Kira standing next to Xuan. They're not alone—several others stand beside them, all cloaked in long, dark robes, their faces shadowed by the fabric.

Reine comes over, looking over my shoulder. Her sharp intake of breath is audible in the otherwise quiet factory. “Is that…?” she trails off, not needing to finish her sentence.

“It’s Kira,” I whisper, the weight of realization crashing down on me. My fingers trace over her face. She looks so young here. Way before the kids were born. I think to myself, comparing the youthful face in the photograph with the Kira I know now.

Reine gently takes the photograph from me, flipping it over. The handwriting, so familiar, reads: “To new beginnings – KT.” My mind races. KT? Kira Tran? What has she gotten herself involved in? The dots start connecting, painting a picture I’m not sure I’m ready to comprehend.

The muffled hum of conversation reaches our ears, forcing Reine and I to look up from the photograph. The rustling sound grows steadily louder, and instinctively, we move further into the shadows.

We carefully inch our way towards the source of the disturbance, keeping an eye out for any movement. The machinery, covered in layers of dust and cobwebs, serves as an effective shield, allowing us a clear view of the unfolding scene.

As we reach the factory’s loading dock, we see Xuan standing there, surrounded by half a dozen figures, their bodies adorned with the same arcane symbols that marked Xuan's face in the diner vision. Their dark robes swish quietly, and the air seems to throb with a palpable energy, thick and foreboding. Lying prostrate on the ground, bound and gagged, is a young man, his face marked by terror. A smashed GoPro camera lies nearby, its light flickering erratically.

"He was snooping around," one of the armed men growls, a hint of amusement in his voice.

“I was just exploring!” the young man pleads,  his voice muffled by the gag.

Urban explorers have become a phenomenon in recent years, thrill-seekers [searching](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1581vef/our_search_for_a_missing_teen_uncovered_the/) for the next abandoned location to document and share with the world. This one unknowingly wandered into a den of vipers.

Xuan glances at the bound man, his face devoid of any emotion. The captive's eyes dart around, pleading for mercy, but the chilling indifference in Xuan's gaze offers no hope.

"Please, I didn’t see anything. I swear!" the captive sobs.

Xuan kneels down, bringing his face inches from the terrified man. "Your fate was sealed the moment you stepped foot here," he says, his voice has a hint of empathy. "But take solace, young one. In death, you shall contribute to the coming of Lua Den."

Before any of us could fully process Xuan's cryptic words, one of the armed acolytes steps forward, holding a syringe filled with a shimmering fluorescent liquid. Its glow seems otherworldly, pulsing as if alive.

Without hesitation, Xuan takes the needle and thrusts it into the young man's arm, emptying the contents into his bloodstream. A guttural scream tears from his throat, resonating with pure agony. His body convulses violently, the light from the liquid spreading, turning his veins a ghostly blue.

Every instinct in my body screams to lunge forward, to do something, anything to save the man from the agonizing fate he’s been subjected to. But a firm grip on my arm stops me. It’s Reine.

Her eyes, usually filled with a fiery determination, are filled with uncharacteristic fear.

Her terrified eyes seem to say, “We can't take them all. Not here. Not now.”

I watch, paralyzed with horror, as the poor soul's body begins a terrifying metamorphosis. His skin turns translucent, each cell pulsating and shifting as if it's being reorganized by the fluorescent substance. His eyes cloud over, becoming milky white orbs devoid of any semblance of humanity. He thrashes violently on the ground for what feels like an eternity, his screams becoming more inhuman and distorted with every passing second.

Then, as abruptly as it began, it stops. The man's writhing body goes limp, his once human form now a rapidly disintegrating mass of shifting, undulating cosmic energy. It's as if the very fabric of his being is torn apart and reassembled into something... beyond our comprehension.

The sight is both captivating and horrifying. A swirling vortex of stars, galaxies, and nebulae takes shape where the man once lay. A gateway to the unknown, a window to the very depths of the universe. And then, as if sucked into a black hole, the shimmering portal collapses onto itself, leaving behind nothing but a few shimmering particles, like stardust.

As the mist dissipates, Xuan calmly steps forward, holding a small vial. With a swift motion, he captures a portion of the lingering mist, sealing it away. The contained essence swirls and pulsates with the same haunting luminescence.

“The Dark Flame awaits,” Xuan murmurs, holding up the vial to inspect its contents. We watch in horror as he adds it to a case containing dozens of similar vials, each pulsating at a different rate, like a chilling chorus. Their ethereal glow paints Xuan in a spectral light. The grim realization hits me – the vials represent a life taken, a soul stolen.

Without wasting any more time, the group moves swiftly towards the [riverbank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLE0P3hr8ZY&t=8484s). A motorboat, equipped with high-powered engines, waits for them. Xuan boards first, followed by his armed entourage, the boat's engines roaring to life.

As the boat speeds away, leaving only the disturbed water in its wake, Reine and I remain paralyzed, struggling to comprehend the nightmare we've just witnessed.

The air is thick with a sensation that's hard to describe – a mix of dread, sorrow, and the unmistakable feeling of being watched by something ancient, something beyond comprehension.
