I was eleven when this happened. My parents still doesn't know. I don’t even know how to tell them without sounding crazy.

We lived in a small barangay in the Philippines, surrounded by rice fields and tall coconut trees that always seemed to whisper when the wind blew. Our house was the last one before the road turned into a dirt path leading to the river. Everyone in the neighborhood warned kids not to stay out past sunset, but nobody explained why. They’d just shake their heads and say, *“May mga bagay na hindi mo maiintindihan.”* There are things that you won’t understand.

I thought it was just old folks being superstitious. *“Kwentong matatanda,”* that’s what we called it.

That night, the power went out. It was one of those heavy, humid nights where the dark feels thicker than the air. My parents said they were going to the barangay. They didn’t say why, but I assumed it was to ask about the power outage. So it was just me and my little sister, Nica, at home. She was already asleep in the bedroom.

I sat in the living room with a candle flickering on the table, trying to finish my Milo before it got cold.

That’s when I heard the knocking.

It wasn’t polite. It was slow, dragging. Three knocks. Then silence.

My heart jumped, but I thought maybe it was a neighbor. I went to the window, pulling the curtain just enough to peek. At first, I saw nothing, just the dark shapes of coconut trees swaying against the night sky. Then I froze.

A woman was standing right outside our door. Her hair was long, almost touching her waist, and it clung to her face like it was damp. She wore a white dress that hung loosely on her body, fluttering slightly even though the air felt still. Her head was bowed, so I couldn’t see her eyes.

“Buksan mo ang pinto, anak.” Open the door, child. She said softly. Her voice was calm.

“Who… who are you?” I managed to ask, my throat dry.

“I’m your Tita (Auntie) Liza,” she replied without lifting her head. “Your mama sent me. There’s been an accident.”

The name didn’t sound familiar at all. “I… I don’t know any Tita Liza.”

She tilted her head slightly, and that’s when I saw her mouth. Her smile stretched wider than it should have. “Of course you do. I’m family.”

Every instinct in my body told me not to move. Something about her voice… it sounded right, but not real. Like she was reciting lines.

Then she said it.

“Open the door… Leo.”

My heart stopped. I never told her my name.

I backed away from the window slowly, trying not to make a sound. That’s when she lifted her head. Her eyes caught the faint glow of the candlelight, and they weren’t normal. They were black and shiny, like oil. Her neck stretched as she leaned closer to the window, and I swear her lips never stopped smiling.

The knocking started again. Louder this time. The wooden door rattled in its frame.  
“Open the door, Leo. Your mama is dying.”

I ran. I grabbed Nica from the bed, she was still half-asleep and mumbling and we slid under the bed. My heart was pounding so loud I thought she could hear it through the walls. I wrapped my arm around Nica and pressed her face into my chest so she wouldn’t make a sound.

Then came the sound of nails scraping against the wood. Long, slow, deliberate. I held my breath until my chest burned.

“Leo…” she whispered. But this time, her voice wasn’t just at the door. It was at the window. Then the other window. Then above us. Scraping sounds crawled across the roof like something was dragging its nails along the tin sheets.

I don’t remember how long we stayed like that. Minutes felt like hours. Then, silence. No voice. No knocking. Just the sound of crickets outside.

When my parents finally came home, I didn’t say a word.

The next day, I asked my mom casually, “Do we have a Tita Liza?”

She frowned. “No… why?”

I just shook my head. But that night, I couldn’t stop thinking about the voice. How it said my name like it knew me.

In the Philippines, people usually call out *“Tao po!”* when knocking on someone’s door. It’s like saying “Is anyone home?” but it literally means “I am human.” My lola once told me that it started as a way to warn the household that you weren’t something else. Something pretending to be human.

The thing outside my house never said it.
