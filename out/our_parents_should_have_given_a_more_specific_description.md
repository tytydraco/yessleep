Dying has never been favorable, so of course finding a way around it has been a top priority for many years. When the government found the solution, it was enormous: controlled reincarnation. This was just the thing for absolutely anyone afraid of death, whether it's coming for them or a loved one.

Soon after creation, they started forming plans for reincarnation. You could set up birth dates for others, as a form of messed-up life insurance, or you could set up one for yourself. Say you had a child and were worried about them dying young, so you set up a plan for them to come back one week after death, as another person's child—a surrogate, of sorts. You could choose guidelines for the surrogate (i.e., location, age, race) and even for your child’s “new” life.

I was born in a big city; I won't say which, but I'll say it's on the East Coast. My parents were, to say the least, fairly well-off, but my childhood was rough. When I was born, I was diagnosed with a rare condition that forced my bones to get skinnier over time until eventually I would lose complete structural support and pass away. The estimate my parents were given was only 14 years. Controlled reincarnation was first created a few weeks before my fifth birthday, and my parents, knowing what was soon to come, immediately set up a plan for me. They chose a hospital for me to come back in, they chose a surrogate they saw fit, and they even chose what they wanted my new body to look like: brown hair, green eyes, pale skin. Fast forward a few years, I’m about to turn 13 and my bones are about as big around as sticks. I knew what was coming.

Continuous checkups let me know that my health was deteriorating over the years leading up to my death. They told me to my face that I didn’t have quite as long as they’d hoped when I was born and that my date was coming up. I had time to come to terms with the fact that once I went, I wouldn’t be the same when I came back. I would have to relive my childhood once again as a different person. At least I’d retain my memories. Part of me was excited to come back as a “new.”

A few weeks after my last checkup, I was struggling to hold on. My breathing was rickety, my eyesight was going blurry, and the headaches—good lord, the headaches. I couldn’t have had more than a week left in me; it was constant pain and torture to endure. So I stopped enduring. I knew I’d come back, so what was the worry? I let go. My vision faded, my breathing slowed, and I felt my heart stop.
…
We could see the light—the bright fluorescents and the talking. We could understand them. They were surprised and scared, almost disgusted. We couldn’t stop crying. We were cold and damp; our skin was blue underneath and covered in blood. Pale. Our eyes felt hotter than the sun, and our body was sore and abnormally heavy. The doctor picked us up with his eyes wide; we could see the fear filling them. He flipped us around. We saw our new mother. Her face was blown up with shock and terror. She was in horrific pain. We caught a glimpse of ourselves in a window reflection.

What is that?

An unimaginable amalgamation of flesh, blood, exposed bone, short brown, almost facial like hair, and eyes—eyes everywhere. All a brownish green color. What I saw of myself was me in the ways that counted. But us? We were vile. My ears had adjusted to the surroundings; screaming was all I heard. The cries of our “body” condensed, and all I could hear was my own—gurgles and coughs coming out of my being. It hurt. My skin was being pulled on by the others in our mound; my scalp was being stretched and ripped. We were ripping. Our mother was in shock; she couldn’t move, and she was the only one in the room not screaming in terror.

The parts of me that weren’t destroyed by my new reality felt awful for her. She’d signed up to be a surrogate and was met—and frankly punished—by this multi-person fusion that she just gave birth to, we were a grotesque collage of flesh and memory. I looked in her eyes; there was nobody there. Our mother had passed, presumably from the heartbreak and utter dread of the situation. In my last life, I was always a critical thinker; all I wanted was to get out of this. The pain was unbearable, worse than my bones slimming.

I heard a few final tears, and with them, I came undone. My insides spilled onto the floor; my brain was exposed due to the bone plate that was once connected to another being being broken. Here I am on the bloody hospital room floor, bleeding out at birth. I felt the same sensation as my last life, except there wasn't another body to escape to.

Six children wishing for new life, joined. Our parents should have used a more specific description.
