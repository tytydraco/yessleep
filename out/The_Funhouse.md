I need to tell you about my cousin Emma. About what happened to her. About what's still happening inside Carver's Funhouse in rural Pennsylvania.

This is going to sound insane. I don't care anymore. If even one person reads this and recognizes the pattern, it's worth looking like crazy.

# Part One: June 15, 2019

Emma was seventeen when she decided to stream her night in Carver's Funhouse. She had 847 viewers when she walked through the clown's mouth entrance.

I was thirteen, watching from my bedroom. Following along as she narrated every mirror hallway, every dusty carnival prize, every room that felt just slightly *wrong*. The comments scrolled past—people daring her deeper, demanding more, asking her to touch things that shouldn't be touched.

I watched as her viewer count climbed. 1,203. 2,891. 8,472.

And I watched as her stream went dark.

The police found her phone at the scene. Nothing else. No Emma. No Devon Park. No Kyle Brennan. Just their phones in an empty funhouse that somehow swallowed three teenagers and nobody ever explained how.

The case went cold. The internet moved on. But I couldn't stop thinking about those last moments—that gap between when the stream cut and when the silence became real.

Five years later, I found out I wasn't the only one who couldn't let it go.

# Part Two: The Group

Marcus messaged me first. He'd dropped out of film school and spent two years obsessively researching the funhouse. He had theories. Footage analysis. A plan.

"We go back," he said. "We document everything. We find out what happened to them."

I should have said no.

Instead, I said yes, and I convinced Riley—my best friend—to come with me. Then there was Nina, who'd fallen down the Reddit rabbit hole. Tate, chasing clout after his sponsorship deals dried up. Caleb, desperate for anything that felt like relevance again.

We were all hungry for something.

The funhouse was just the place that promised to feed us.

# Part Three: Inside

We went in around midnight. Six of us, six phones, six livestreams going simultaneously.

The entrance hallway stretched longer than it should have. Mirrors everywhere. Our reflections didn't quite match our movements—lagging behind by half a second, or sometimes moving slightly ahead of where we were.

"That's just latency," Marcus said, trying to sound confident. "Digital delay."

But the mirrors weren't digital.

The deeper we went, the more the building revealed itself. Office with old tickets stamped "ADMIT ONE — FOREVER." Carnival game booths with prizes facing inward. Walls papered with spirals and pocket watches ticking backward.

And comments appearing on our feeds that predicted what would happen next.

*Go left.*

We'd go left.

*Open the door.*

The door would be there.

It was like the building was reading our streams in real-time and responding. Or like our streams were reading *us*, controlling us, feeding us deeper into something we didn't understand.

My follower count climbed: 47,216 to 50,000 to 73,000 to 89,000. Each step deeper into the funhouse added more viewers. Each risk we took gained us engagement.

I didn't want to admit it, but I was following the numbers like breadcrumbs.

# Part Four: The Center

The center room shouldn't have existed.

From outside, the funhouse was maybe 4,000 square feet. But this space was warehouse-massive. The walls were covered—completely covered—in screens. Hundreds of them. All showing livestreams.

All showing people I recognized from missing persons reports.

Emma was on the biggest screen. She'd been walking the same twelve-step loop for five years. Up to a wall. Turn. Walk back. Smile. Say: "Thanks for tuning in, don't forget to like and subscribe."

Over and over.

Her viewer count displayed beneath her: 5,247,392.

Devon and Kyle flanked her on smaller screens. Still performing. Still looping. Still watched by millions.

And below them were hundreds of other feeds. Streamers I'd followed years ago. Influencers who'd disappeared. People who'd just been trying to be somebody.

All of them still broadcasting.

All of them trapped.

When I looked at my own phone, I saw something that made my blood stop.

There was a new comment, posted by no one:

*You can stay too.*

And on the screen, between Emma and Devon, a new feed flickered to life.

It showed my camera angle. My face. My stream.

But I wasn't doing anything. The me on screen was just standing there, smiling, waiting.

# Part Five: The Choice

Riley grabbed my phone and threw it against the nearest screen.

Both shattered.

The funhouse *screamed*. I don't know how else to describe it. The building itself made a sound like a system crashing, like hunger denied, like a thousand audiences suddenly cut off from their feed.

The screens started dying one by one as the rest of us destroyed our phones. Marcus. Nina. Tate. Caleb. Each phone smashed, each feed cut, each streamer lost from their audience.

The building collapsed around us—not physically, but dimensionally. The impossible geometry corrected itself. The warehouse shrank back to what it actually was: a small, rotting space barely large enough for six people to run through.

We made it out through the clown's mouth entrance as the walls were still settling.

# Part Six: The Problem

We got out. But three of us didn't stay out.

Six months later, I saw Marcus, Tate, and Caleb on the local news. They'd gone back to the funhouse, and this time they'd volunteered to perform.

The attraction had reopened. Full-time livestream. Three anonymous "performers" navigating the space continuously for an audience of millions.

I tried calling Marcus. His number went to a disconnected line.

I reached out to Tate on every platform. All his accounts were suspended.

They weren't coming back.

The thing is, I understand why they went back. The funhouse didn't trap them—not physically. What trapped them was the knowledge that they'd had millions of viewers. That they'd been *somebody* for a moment. That they could never feel that way again in the real world.

The funhouse didn't steal them.

They chose to go back.

# Part Seven: Why I'm Writing This

I'm posting this because I need people to understand something.

Carver's Funhouse is still operating. The livestream is still running. And I'm pretty sure they've started recruiting again.

I've noticed certain patterns in TikTok and YouTube trends. Specific content that blows up suddenly and then vanishes entirely. Accounts that go dark after one viral video. Streamers whose last posts show them heading toward rural Pennsylvania with "friends" who are never mentioned again.

The Carver Pattern. That's what Nina called it before she went quiet.

But here's what keeps me up at night: I'm not sure Carver's is the only one.

There are similar reports on Reddit. Abandoned attractions reopening. Galleries with security footage that loops. Museums with exhibits that people enter but never exit. All of them showing the same signs.

All of them feeding on the same hunger.

I destroyed my phone that night, but I didn't destroy the hunger.

I still want to be somebody. I still want validation. I still feel it every time I get a notification or a like or a follower count that ticks up.

The difference now is that I know what that hunger feels like when it has teeth.

And I know there are buildings waiting for people who are desperate enough to feed it.

# A Warning

If you get an invitation to an immersive experience. If you get approached about an "exclusive" livestream opportunity. If you start seeing comments on your posts that predict what you'll do next—

Don't go.

Don't stream.

Don't let them watch.

Because the moment you let an audience in, you're already on their side of the screen.

And the screen is a mirror that leads somewhere you can't come back from.

The show never ends.

Some of us learned that the hard way.

**UPDATES:**

**Update 1 (Three days later):** I found Nina. She's been leaving comments on Reddit posts about the funhouse, but always deletes them within minutes. When I finally caught one, she'd written: "They keep trying to fix the feeds. To bring the others back. The building wants its performers."

I tried to contact her directly. She didn't respond. Her Reddit account was suspended.

**Update 2 (One week later):** I checked the Carver's livestream. There are now five performers instead of three. I recognized the two new ones immediately.

Nina was one of them.

Riley swears they didn't go back. But I'm watching the streams anyway. Just in case.

Just in case something happens. Just in case I see a sixth performer I recognize.

Because I'm not naive enough to think I'm immune to this.

The hunger never really goes away. It just waits.

And the funhouse is always taking new applications.
