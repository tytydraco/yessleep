&#x200B;

I’m going to visit Tim in the hospital today. My mom called yesterday and told me ‘it’s time.’ 

  
From two states away, I replied, “Booking a flight for tomorrow… I love you.”

  
After graduating college, I moved far and found an unstable job. Live in a rotting apartment now because it doesn’t pay well, and I just checked online for plane tickets and discovered I’ll have to take transit instead.   
  
I’m on the bus now. The guy sitting next to me forgot his deodorant. Four hours to go. There’s no way to sleep now so I can use this time to tell you how I escaped with Tim from the Three Kings Ski Resort.  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Grendel hadn’t been heard in some time. Regardless, my attention was focused elsewhere.

  
The radio-phone crackled in my hand when the gravelly voice spoke again.

  
“*You need to start talking, now*.”

  
Squeezing the button on the side, I held the phone to my mouth. I had no clue what to say but I started with:

  
“My name is Phil. Me and my brother, we’re stuck on this mountain. Fuck’s sake we need help.”

  
“*And* ***why*** *are you on that mountain?*”

  
I put all my brainpower into quickly and accurately telling him what happened, stopping after we found the rules and escaped from Mountain #1.

  
“Please, man, people are dead.”

  
“*Who’s dead?*”

  
“One of my brother’s friends on Mountain #2. And a man, I don’t know who, that came up after us. Skiers got him.”

  
“*Who was the other man?*”

  
I told him I wasn’t sure and described him to the radio. It responded angrily.

  
“*That dumb fucker. Idiot*,” he paused. “*That was Artie. He was most likely the man your friend paid to get on the resort. He was grandfathered into ownership and we warned him, but he never believed it. Even gave him a set of rules.*”

  
“Then who the hell are you.”

  
The man on the other end of the line paused, uncertain.

  
“*You call me Kip. I used to work there a long, long time ago right near the end. My father did too. Ski patrol. Our job was to enforce the rules and to make sure everyone that went up, made it back down*.”

  
Kip sighed, revealing the age in his voice.

  
“*It didn’t take long for us to realize that was not possible. And it took far longer for the ones above us to put an end to the madness… You’re in the lodge now, yes?*”

  
“Yea… So, it is real. I’m not schizo and losing mind.”

  
“*I’m sorry lad. This is no dream.*”

  
At a loss for words, I barely managed to ask, “How?”

  
“*Well, that even my father couldn’t tell me. What he knew was the group of entrepreneurs involved with its creation, laughed off the stories of the Arapaho tribe. Throughout their people’s many journeys into the Rocky Mountains they encountered these mountains only once. Of the caravan of fifty that travelled up, none but a young man was able to return to the tribe and recount his story. He told them those peaks belonged to the Three Kings and there they slept. They had awoken one of them, resulting in the decimation of his caravan. He gave them names; the one that had slaughtered his tribesman he called Siisii, adapted from their word for serpent. The original names for the other two Kings I can’t recall but the entrepreneurs took it upon themselves to rename them. Draca and Grendel.*”

  
I allowed Kip to continue.

  
“*All of the evil on that mountain likely relates to them. Those men, they knew the probable consequences. Even mocked them when they named the place. Wasn’t long before we disturbed another. I was there. The slopes were painted red, and Draca took my father the day the Three Kings Resort closed.*”

  
It was Kip now who had nothing to say. He had released the button making static return and I let it sing its crackly tune.

  
I felt worse. Reality clicked in my head, focusing in like a camera image finally stabilizing to reveal the hard edges under all the blur. I felt horribly human; weak and powerless against my situation within the domain of these things.

  
“*Are you there, Phil?*”

  
Pressing the button on my radio, I responded.

  
“Please help me, Kip.”

  
“*I will. Did you find my gun? It should still be there.*”

  
The revolver was on the ground behind me and I twisted to pick it up and hold it firmly in my hand.

  
“Yea.”

  
“*Bullets?*”

  
“Yes.”

  
“*Good, they’re silver, you can manage the skiers with that.*”

  
I spun the cylinder. There were five bullets inside.

  
“*There’s no safety, so careful with that trigger… I can come to you, but you're gonna have to make it down that mountain yourself. Those are the rules.*”

  
“What if –”

  
This time I could tell Grendel was upon me, by the magnitude of his atomic scream. An unstoppable force had reached the lodge. With my fingers still on the radio’s button, Kip was able to hear the bestial roar that rattled the fragments of broken mirror around me.  

  
I jumped to my feet and ran into the main room of the lodge aiming for one of the windows. My finger slipped off the radio and from it spewed Kip’s delirious voice.

  
“*What is that, Boy, what have you done? No. NO.*”  
Reaching the window, I peeled away the curtain and set my eyes upon the last King of the mountains. Skiers flew across the snow outside and past the lodge, in clear attempts to flee the humanoid. Their erratic movements had intensified ten-fold and their entire bodies spasmed, urging them forward, away from Him.

  
In my hand, the radio crackled for the last time.

  
“*You’ve condemned us.*”

  
And then three short beeps.

  
Hardly noticing, my mouth agape, I tried to wrap my head around Grendel’s enormity. The King’s knees cleared the treetops and His arms hung below them. A thin coat of frost singed fur sprouted from skin that resembled cracked stone. These fissures in the skin – what I now realize could only have been scars – reached all over Grendel’s body and some were carved across His awful face.

  
The blue stars burning in His eye sockets searched through the skiers scattering like ants, and with shocking agility, plucked one between His pillar sized fingers.

  
The skier looked like an animal caught in a trap, its attempts to escape becoming feral. Grendel lifted the squirming skier and held it up to His eyes. With His other hand Grendel placed His fingers around its head, restricting its movements but not stopping them. Once again defying His appearance, Grendel delicately removed the face coverings of the skier. 

  
Still a good 60 meters or so away at the time, I’m not able to know for sure what I saw under the balaclava of the skier. For certain its head was hairless and as pale as the snow that began to fall. What I can’t believe was how its skin seemed to be layered… almost scaly.

  
Grendel was not interested it seemed. Annoyed at the writhing thing in His fingers, He squeezed until it popped. The skier stopped moving and the lower half of its body fell the long distance to the ground. Apathetic, Grendel tossed the rest of the skier off the mountain.  


Megalophobia gripped me and I likely would’ve waited in frozen terror until Grendel tore off the roof of the lodge if Tim hadn’t said something. He didn’t say any English words, it was more of a, “oouuuua.”  


Tim was still, for the most part, unmoving on the floor. His finger twitched, almost at me, almost beckoning. I headed right for the bathroom closet again stepping over all the mess and picked up the sled with the cartoonishly large first aid kit on top of it. I was going to leave when I noticed some rope in one of the dark corners. Along with an extra pair of ski poles, I grabbed the rope, sled, and first aid kit and left back to the main room. 

  
Tim was heavy and not knowing the extent of his injuries, I tried to be as cautious as possible when hefting him onto the wooden toboggan. I secured both Tim and the first aid kit onto the toboggan, leaving a little extra rope to pull the sled with. The weights in my pocket reminded me of the revolver and flare gun. I got my skis on and headed to the window one last time. It had been ominously quiet.  
	

A blue sun stared back from behind the curtain. Grendel’s eye gave off a strong enough light that I winced against it. The window exploded as He forced His massive hand through it, splintering the wood frame and causing the wall to heave.  
	

I ran back to Tim and the sled, screaming. Heaving towards the door, the rope cut off the circulation to my fingers as I pulled with all my strength. A groaning log from the roof crashed onto the spot where Tim lay a second ago and the roof soon caved in with it.   


Outside the lodge with Tim in tow, I could see Grendel squatting, His hand shoved through a wrecking ball sized hole in the side of the small building. Immediately, He saw me and rose to His full staggering height.  
	

The lift wasn’t running, and I pushed past it almost at the beginning of the slope now. Dragging the toboggan slowed me down considerably and one of Grendel’s steps halved the distance between us.   
	

When I pushed off the edge of the slope and started down the mountain, the final rule for Mountain #1 pushed to the front of my brain. I quickly scanned the trail ahead of me and the surrounding forest for signs of the impending hunt.   
	

Our speed was increasing rapidly, and the sled began to inch ahead of me. A crashing from behind us indicated that Grendel was still in pursuit; on all fours and pawing down the mountain after us, like a gigantic lion hunting zebra.   
	

With Tim now pulling me down the mountain and no way to steer, I held onto the rope and prayed.   
	

Skiers started pouring out of the forest in a human tsunami, spilling out onto the trail and converging behind me as a horde.

  
I bet it looked pretty funny, like in the old-timey slapstick movies. A three-way chase down the side of a mountain. Tim and I, in the lead with our extra speed from the toboggan, followed by what looked like 100 skiers, and bringing up the rear, a giant. All we needed was some silly music.

  
A handful of the skiers were too slow and wordlessly ground to meaty pulp by Grendel as He dragged Himself down the slope with His fists. 

  
We were about halfway down the mountain. In front of me the ropes still held Tim and the first aid kit tightly to the toboggan. Tim’s goggles and mask covered his face and I wondered if his eyes were open.

  
I didn’t notice at first because I was going so fast, but the trees bordering the trail had new attributes. What seemed like long white tubes, as thick as the trunks themselves hung from and intertwined amongst the branches. Blurs at first, I focused my eyes and caught glints of light shining from milky scales. 

  
Broad heads as large as televisions swayed from side to side, watching from above. Almost every tree had an elephantine serpent adorning its branches. They made no move to join the chase but almost seemed to resemble guards, ensuring that the prey stayed within the boundaries of the hunt.

  
Distracted by these new beasts, I didn’t see Russ – or whatever that thing was that used to be Russ – emerge from the woods further down the slope and position himself directly onto the immovable path that the sled was taking. 

  
Travelling at a deadly speed, we smashed into Russ and sent him flying up and over us. The toboggan drifted sharply to the left and suddenly flipped, forcing me to ski into and crash along with it. A hollow *dok* sound registered when the ground met me.

  
By the time I stopped rolling, I was three quarters of the way down the mountain. Tim and the first aid kit had come loose from the sled. The first aid kit had sprung open in the crash and lay motionless alongside Tim.

  
Up the mountain, the hunt looks to have been paused. All of the skiers had turned and currently occupied Grendel’s attention. Except for one.

  
Russ rose to his feet. His arm and shin were broken but he still wobbled over with abrupt movements and showed no signs of pain. His deflated limbs bounced and swung like pool noodles beneath their twisted joints. 

  
“Shit… *shit*!”

  
I tried to scramble backwards but the nerves in my leg felt like someone had grabbed them into a handful and yanked hard; tightening like a corset. The *dok* sound I had heard. My snowpants were ripped, and off to the side of my now vacant knee was my patella, lodged awkwardly under my skin like a tumor.

  
I tried to punch it back into its socket, but each strike elicited an agonizing whimper. There was no time. Russ was on top of me and holding my neck firmly in his grasp just as I reached into my jacket pocket and curled my finger around the smooth metal trigger. 

  
I felt the world’s most highly pressurized balloon pop under my coat. 

  
My first thought was ‘*I can’t believe I just shot myself.*’ The sudden stabbing pain in my ribs was convincing but must’ve been from recoil because Russ stiffened and rolled off of me onto the snow. 

  
Pulling the revolver from my pocket, I planted the barrel on top of Russ’ temple. Barely enough time for him to squeal, the hammer of the gun snapped, and the barrel exploded. 

  
Being too close to the gun, I wasn’t able to hear for a few seconds, but I could see Russ’ head looked like someone had stepped onto a plate of Jello. The liquid that poured out of him looked pink and far more viscous than any blood I’ve seen. 

  
It took a moment for the ringing in my ears to subside, and eventually be replaced by another sound. An engine. At the bottom of the slope a snow-fitted pickup truck emerged into view and parked next to the lift. 

  
I dropped my head in relief and barked a laugh. Who knew a shitty Ford could look so good.

  
The passenger door popped open and a figure covered in a huge winter jacket and snowpants hurried out, unfastening a snowmobile strapped on the bed of the car. By the time the driver door opened, the person had mounted the snowmobile and began to gun it towards the mountain.

  
“*Wait!*”

  
A voice I faintly recognized. Kip. He hobbled out of the driver door of the pickup truck and reached an arm out as if to grab for the rider on the snowmobile.

  
“*Don’t go up there*!”

  
Luckily, we were close to the bottom, and the snowmobile made quick work of the steep incline. I checked behind me as it drew closer.

  
Grendel had finished with the army of skiers. A plateau of bodies covered a decent section of the trail and a roar from Grendel focused my eyes back towards the King. His iris’ shone and from this far away, slightly obscured by the snowy winds, it looked like there were twin lighthouses standing in the distance.

  
I felt the snow vibrate as Grendel began to head down the mountain, and towards us once again.

  
“HURRY!” I shouted and turned to see Tim being hefted onto the back of the snowmobile.

  
“Can you move?” the rider, a man, called to me. 

  
Terrified, I nodded and tried to stand but my knee shrieked in protest, and I fell back onto my ass. It felt like someone had punched it, and I realized that my kneecap had slid back into place. This by no means meant that I could walk, and my knee began to swell to the size of a golf club.

  
“No, I need help,” I begged. The man made sure Tim wouldn’t fall and drove the snowmobile over to me. He stopped as he got off and I recognized the look on his face when he saw Grendel heaving down the mountain.

  
“Time for us to go.”

  
He extended a hand for me to grab. 

  
What I didn’t know at the time was that the man in front of me was Kip’s son. His name was Corey. Every time I’m forced to retell this story, I make a point to explain how Corey was a hero. Though usually by then anyone listening has mentally checked out, silently labeling me as either an attention seeker or a freak. I don’t care much anymore. 

  
Corey had convinced his dad to come out and save us. Reminded him why he started working on the mountain in the first place. Like most heroes, Corey didn’t die a good death.

  
With everything going on, it was impossible to notice the great white serpent burrowing through the snow at us. It struck Corey with it’s massive mouth, nearly swallowing his entire arm. 

  
He gasped and made a terrible noise while, in the blink of an eye, the snake pulled him to the ground and coiled its muscular body around him. Corey was a big guy, and yet the snake had barely used a third of its body to securely wrap the entirety of his length. 

  
For a moment, my eyes met the giant reptile’s and I felt as though it told me something in a wordless, alien tongue.

  
*Do not interfere with the hunt.*

  
As fast as the snake had come, Corey was dragged away, choking and screaming into the forest by the slithering monster.



“COREY!”  
	

Kip, still at the bottom of the slope, fell to his knees and let out an anguished cry I couldn’t hear over the sound of thunderous steps behind me. I felt it though, in my bones, and Kip’s despair washed over me. For the second time on this mountain, I felt ready to – no, wanted to – die.  
	

 I rolled onto my back and saw the thing that changed my mind. Grendel looked down at me from above the trees. He had no expression but the malice that radiated from His titanic mass consumed everything. I would’ve rather died a hundred times to my own hands than resign myself to whatever fate the King had for me.  
	

Grendel arm began to get larger and I realized that He was reaching to grab me. I was somewhat able to move now but my knee still slowed me down far too much. In my pocket, a weight nudged my bruised ribs.  
	

The revolver. Freeing it from my jacket, I aimed the gun at my target, so large He was impossible to miss. And yet every time I squeezed the trigger, I flinched more than Grendel did. Unfazed, He closed His hand around me.  
	

My sanity was a pane of glass, thrown from a cliff and about to smash into pieces on a rocky shore. I was a few seconds away from worshipping the thing if it meant mercy. Instead, I reached once again into my jacket pocket and found the flare gun.   
	

I was still gaining altitude in Grendel’s hand and at chest level to the King, I fired.  
	

“FUCK YOU, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!”  
	

The sound was similar to a roman candle firework.  


*Thunk*  


A weak red glow floated from my hands and into the scarred chest of Grendel, settling snugly into one of the deep crevices. Within a few seconds the glow sputtered, dimmed, and then suddenly, ignited.  
	

*Fwoom*  
	

The white bristly hair surrounding the flare eagerly caught flame like straw,  and soon Grendel’s entire chest was an orange sea of fire.  
	

Probably for the first time in His long life, Grendel was in a panic. In the mayhem, I was sent flying through the cold air, suddenly released from His grip. A large mound of powdery snow cushioned my fall and from a safe distance, I watched Grendel.

  
Beating His chest like a drum, Grendel swatted the spreading fire to no avail. He gathered ridiculous quantities of snow into His hands and threw them onto His torso, but by then the fire had spread to His arms, back, and legs. 

  
 The last howl He made then was something you can only witness once in your lifetime. I felt the wind change directions when out of his mouth came the rage, and fear, of a King. And with that, He turned and fled up the mountain, now a mobile blaze traveling through the sky.   


It was minutes before the air was silent again. The wind whistled around the trees, and the sound of my quick breaths were accompanied by small clouds of vapor. Still, I watched Grendel. From this distance He just looked like a giant ball of smoke, rapidly ascending the mountains. It traveled from the first mountain, to the third and eventually disappeared at the peak of Mountain #3.  
	

“Philip? Are you alive?”  


Kip was calling from the bottom of the slope, still on his knees.  


I tested my leg for a response and found it tolerable. Half-crawling and half-scooting I made my way towards Tim and the snowmobile and clambered on. The ride down felt far too long and at the bottom, I let myself slide off the snowmobile and fall asleep in the freshly fallen snow.  
  
  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
My bus ride just finished. I don’t have time to drop anything off, so I’ll just uber to the hospital.  
  
  
I used to go visit Tim at the hospital a lot. So did Russ’ family, as they were unable to recover Russ’ body. Eventually, they stopped speaking to us all together.

  
Tim had shattered a good amount of his spine and head trauma ensured that even if he did wake up, he wouldn’t be my brother. Right now, he looks the same way he did on the mountain. Maybe that’s why I couldn’t stomach it any longer. Maybe it reminds me of how useless I was. Unable to save my own little brother. Who would go and see that movie.

  
I’m the only one in the room with him right now. My mom and the doctors left to give me some time. And so, for the last few precious moments with my brother, instead of talking to him, I’m writing this. 

  
I can’t bear to face him. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  


My time with Tim is up. My mom came in and rested her hands on my shoulder. And then the doctors, like drones moving wordlessly around the room, avoiding eye contact.

  
“Are you ready?” one of them asked.

  
My mom nodded. 

  
Tim ended up breathing on his own for an hour. Only my ass-hole brother could be that stubborn. We stayed with him the whole time, and towards the end, I held his hand.

During last few gasps, when he began to struggle for air, he squeezed my hand. I leaned forward and told him:

  
“You were always the better skier.”

  
Kip stayed in touch with me. We were bound, connected now by tragedy and loss. He told me stories about Corey, and I shared my own about Tim.  


He said that Corey was in the room when Kip was on the radio with me.  
“He really kicked me in the ass, called me a coward for even thinking of abandoning you. And I’m sorry that those were my intentions.”

  
I told him not to worry. I probably would have done the same.

  
Over the months, we talked quite a bit, and he cleared some things up for me.   


Supposedly, Artie, the man torn apart by the skiers, was who Russ’ father contacted about the mountain. Soon after we left, Russ’ father asked Artie to check on us, even paying extra for him to do so. Grabbing his friend, Jerry (who Kip mentioned was Artie’s plus one whenever he went on his drug-fueled benders), they ascended the mountain.   


The incident didn’t even make the news.  


I asked more about the Kings and history of the mountains and it would be a while before Kip began to invite me over periodically to explain. Everything he told me would be too much to write here, and frankly, I don’t want to right now. I need time to grieve.  


Here’s a rough summary of what I learned from our conversations:

  
*In some texts from the southwestern indigenous tribes of the U.S., Grendel’s sleep cycle is recorded as 80 to 100 years of hibernation followed by only a single year of lucidness. The periods that He was awake for were labeled the ‘Dread Years.’ He is the last of a long-forgotten race of titans that once ruled the Earth.*

  
*Mountain #1 belonged to SiiSii, the Serpent King. His hunters, the skiers, supposedly have the King’s blood running through their veins. From what Kip knows, he says that more than anything, the skiers were entertainment for SiiSii, while He left the jobs of protection and enforcement to his King’s guard. The serpent that took Corey was one of them. There isn’t much known about them. According to the lone survivor from the Arapaho caravan, SiiSii emerged from the forest on their descent from the mountain and headed north after His attack.*

  
*Mountain #2 is a labyrinth, residence of Draca. There is talk of treasure at the end of a dizzying maze of paths, if you can find a way past the trees… and the voices. So far, no one has lasted more than a few minutes past the time limit dictated by the rules. Except on that one day. A young boy found a way through… Kip refused to explain further.*  


  
I explained to him what I’ve been doing, writing about what happened and how it’s helped in way. Kind of therapeutic. He scolded me at first, argued about how it might encourage people to go looking for the place.

  
Recently, I’ve been talking to him more, and he seems to be opening up to the idea. Said he might want to write about what happened on the day the resort closed. I don’t want to pressure him or anything but I told him that it’s a good idea.

  
And if this story isn’t deterrent enough, to everyone reading this, **do not** go looking for those mountains. You can decide whether to believe me or not, but for the sake of my brother, please. Do not come looking for this place.
