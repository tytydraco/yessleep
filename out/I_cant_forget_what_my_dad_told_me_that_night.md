When I was in high school my dad lived with my three aunts and grandfather that had dementia. My youngest aunt and I were very close only two years apart in age. During this time in our lives, we were very obsessed with YouTube videos about the supernatural. This led into the rabbit hole of Ouija board stories, most of which were obviously fake looking back on it. 

One night Dad was very drunk (he was an alcoholic) and my aunt and I were watching people play with Ouija boards. We had decided to ask my dad if he had ever had any experiences with "spooky" stuff. Or if he believed Ouija boards were real. He first started off by stating that he did not believe in them. He mentioned something along the lines of believing it had something to do with kinetic energy.

Before I get into everything that had transpired in his telling of the story I would like to give a little backstory. When my father was a child he lived with only his mother. His father wasn't around most of his life and for the most part, wasn't in the picture. He wandered around and slept with many women instead of his wife. This caused my dad to live solely with his mom and was raised by her. 

Now, about my grandmother... She was very peculiar, to say the least. She was somewhat clinically insane and would say a lot of odd things. I never got the chance to meet her as she died when I was very young, but I've heard many stories about her. My grandmother didn't work and drew a disability check due to being mentally unstable. 

My father had told me accounts of her believing in the supernatural and how we had a family of traveling mediums and such. She also told stories about being a little girl and seeing red eyes at the end of her bed that would come into her room at night. Things such as that. 

Continuing onto the story, since my dad was drunk when recalling the story many details would get added on as he would retell them. I guess I should mention that he was belligerent during this retelling, but the details every time were always the same, only slightly different. One detail that always remained the same was that no matter what, he should never touch the Ouija board in their attic.

My dad said he had a friend over one night, they were very close friends at this point in time. They thought it would be fun to sneak out of the house and go to a shed a little ways from the house. It was a small shed made only for handling small bits of storage. It was empty due to my grandmother previously buying a newer model. My dad had snuck into the attic before heading out grabbing the ouija board and going to meet his friend at the shed. They waited until it was dark and carried a singular flashlight along with a blindfold.

Once, inside of the shed they had devised a plan where one would hold the flashlight while the other would look away while wearing the blindfold so that they would know if it was real or not. Also, so that the one playing the Ouija board could not cheat and move the piece. They played this game a few times with nothing happening. They did a few rounds of back and forth before it circled back around to my dad's turn. He took the piece and covered his eyes with a blindfold looking away. A click of a flashlight sounded and he began by asking the board a question, "Can anyone hear me? Hello?". 

Abruptly, the piece flew hitting the wall with a hard thud. Both my dad and his friend jumped scurrying over to the shed door startled by the events that occurred. My dad said that they had looked at each other bewildered with fear, asking each other if they had done that. He said there was too much fear in his friend's eyes for him to be lying and that he had only a singular finger on the moving piece, lightly placed onto it. He said that this had always stuck with them.

He still doesn't know if what transpired that day was real, but can't easily rationally explain what happened that night. The next day they said they had told his mom, who was visibly upset... even angry with them. She took the board out breaking and smashing it into tiny pieces, before tossing it to the ground and setting it into flames. They never spoke about that night again. 

I never had the chance to ask him, since his sober years if the story was real. But every now and then he mentions when on a video call with him that a figure watches him from his room. It's there when he leaves for work and there when he comes back. I've never seen the figure myself as I have moved states. For now, this is all I have to offer, I just got reminded of this story I was told after my last video call, with the strange figure that he tried showing me. Feel free to comment or ask any questions, I talk to my dad on the weekends and could possibly get more answers.
