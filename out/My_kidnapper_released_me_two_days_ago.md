I've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and seventeen minutes. Not that I'm counting. Actually, that's a lie. I am counting. Every second feels like a miracle and a nightmare simultaneously. Every tick of freedom is weighed down by what I know and what I can't bring myself to tell anyone.

Three years.

That's how long I was held in that basement. At least, that's what they are estimating at the hospital due to my blood work. Time blurred together in that windowless room, marked only by the steady drip of a leaking pipe and his footsteps on the stairs. That drip. That goddamn drip. Sometimes I would lie awake counting them until I reached thousands, feeling my sanity slip away with each watery pulse.

I don't remember who I was before. Not anymore. The worst part is knowing that I used to remember. For the first few months of captivity, I clung to my identity like a lifeline. I had a name. I had a home. I had people who loved me. I had a life.

But he couldn't stand it when I'd recite these facts to myself in the dark. He'd fly into rages when I'd whisper my real name over and over like a prayer.

"You're no one," he'd scream, bringing his fists down on my head, my face, my temples. "You're mine now. Nothing else."

The doctors at the hospital believe I have severe brain damage from repeated trauma. Scans show old fractures in my skull that healed without medical attention. Dark patches on my brain where blood pooled and scarred. Memory centers, damaged beyond repair.

Now the police ask questions I can't answer. Did I have family? Friends? A job? A home? The only clear memory I have from before is standing outside a Trader Joe's, nearly dropping a paper bag of groceries as one of the handles ripped. It was raining lightly. I remember thinking I should have brought an umbrella.

Then a hand clamped over my mouth. A bag over my head. The smell of chemicals. Darkness.

When I woke up, I was in that room. Concrete walls stained with substances I tried not to identify. A thin mattress on the floor that reeked of mold and worse things. A bucket in the corner that he'd empty only when the stench became unbearable even to him. A single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling that he would turn on and off at random intervals, destroying any sense of day or night I might have clung to.

The first month, I screamed until my vocal cords shredded.

I clawed at the door until my fingernails tore off, leaving bloody streaks on the wood. I begged whatever god might be listening to either save me or kill me. Neither happened.

He never told me his name.

I never saw his face clearly. At least... for the longest time I didn't see his face, not that finally seeing it helped. I'll explain soon. He always wore a mask when he came down, a plain white medical mask at first, then more elaborate ones as time went on. Sometimes animals. Sometimes cartoon characters. The Mickey Mouse one was the worst. He'd wear it on days he decided I needed to be "disciplined."

I won't describe what that entailed. I can't. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

It was painful. Horrific.

That cheerful mouse face watching as he told me I was his masterpiece, a true blank canvas. That humans should be grateful for lives that are full of endless opportunities.

Once, he didn't feed me for two weeks. Just water. By the end, I was hallucinating, seeing shadows dance on the walls. When he finally came down with a plate of cold spaghetti, I wept with gratitude. I kissed his feet. I would have done anything. I did do anything.

The strangest part was how routine it all became. The terror never fully subsided, but it evolved into something duller, more manageable. Sometimes he'd bring me books. Dog-eared paperbacks with coffee stains and torn covers. Sometimes he'd sit in a folding chair and make me read to him, correcting my pronunciation instantly when I stumbled over words. Sometimes he'd leave a small radio that only picked up static and religious broadcasts. The preachers' voices became as familiar as my own thoughts.

When winter came, I could tell from the bone-deep chill that seeped through the concrete. He'd bring down a space heater sometimes, but only if I'd been "good." I learned to stop shivering in his presence because it annoyed him. I learned to regulate my body temperature through sheer will. I learned things about survival that no human should know.

I stopped asking why. I stopped begging to be released. I stopped speaking altogether around the two-year mark. What was the point?

The silence became my armor. He hated it. He'd scream at me, shake me, try anything to make me talk. But I'd retreated so far inside myself by then that my body was just an empty shell. Sometimes I would watch him from somewhere above, like I was floating near the ceiling, observing this broken girl with matted hair and skin stretched tight over protruding bones.

The worst times were when he was kind. When he'd bring me a warm blanket. When he'd clean the infected cuts on my legs with surprising gentleness. When he'd read to me as I drifted off to sleep. Those moments confused me, made me question everything. Stockholm syndrome, the hospital psychologist called it later. I call it hell.

Then, two days ago, he came down the stairs without his usual measured steps. He was rushing, frantic. No mask this time. And his face... I know he wasn't wearing a mask.

It was human skin. But no eyes. No mouth or hair. No ears or nose.

No features at all.

Just... a blank... canvas.

That's all I remember about his face.

"Time to go," he said, injecting something into my arm before I could react. As consciousness slipped away, I heard the basement door open again. Shuffling. A muffled cry. Another person.

"Your replacement has arrived," he whispered in my ear.

I woke up on a park bench twenty miles from the house where I'd been held. My hospital bracelet says Jane Doe. The police have been kind but frustrated by my inability to provide details. I can't describe his face even though I finally saw it.

But I remember his voice.

The way it would soften when he was about to hurt me. The slight lisp on certain words. The wet sound of his mouth when he'd lean close to whisper things he planned to do to me. It's strange how my brain protected some memories while obliterating others. The neurologist explained that severe, repeated head trauma can create a patchwork of memory loss. "Your brain sacrificed your identity to preserve your survival instincts," she told me. Sometimes I still feel the phantom pain of those blows, the ringing in my ears that wouldn't stop for days, the world tilting as I tried to hold onto who I was before everything went dark. And last night, as a nurse was checking my vitals, I heard a news report on the small television in my hospital room. A 19-year-old girl had gone missing outside a Trader Joe's. One town over from where we are now.

I should tell the police everything I know. I should help them find her. I should be doing something, anything.

But I can't. I physically can't.

Because as he was preparing to release me, after I'd heard those muffled cries from upstairs, unmistakably female, young, terrified, he grabbed my face with one gloved hand, squeezing until I thought my jaw would break.

"Listen carefully," he whispered, his breath hot against my ear. "You're going to leave here. You're going to stay quiet. If I see one police sketch, if I hear one whisper that you're helping them find me, I will cut her throat while playing a recording of your voice. She'll die believing you killed her."

He showed me a phone then, replaying snippets of my voice he'd recorded over the years. My pleas, my screams, even my reading voice from those bizarre sessions where he'd make me read aloud from classic novels for hours until my throat was raw.

"I've already told her all about you," he continued. "How you helped pick her. How you're my partner. She thinks you've just gone out for supplies." His tone was nothing less than excited. "She's waiting for you to come back. For three years, just like you waited."

But here's the thing that keeps me frozen, the thing I haven't told anyone until now:

When he released me, he whispered something else: "You did so well, I'll be coming back for you. This is just intermission. And remember, her blood will be on your hands if you talk."

And on my discharge papers from the hospital, tucked into the folder the nurse gave me this morning, I found a small note on Mickey Mouse stationery:

"Miss you already. The new girl isn't nearly as much fun. She keeps asking when you're coming back. I told her you'd return soon to help me with her. Tick tock."

Along with the note was a small USB drive. When I plugged it in at a library far from the hospital, it contained only a single video file. Ten seconds of footage showing a young woman, blindfolded and gagged, huddled in the same corner of the same basement where I spent three years. A timestamp on the video showed it was recorded just four hours ago.

In the background, my voice, pieces of recordings stitched together, saying: "Don't worry, I'll be back soon. We're going to have so much fun together."

I've been free for exactly two days, twelve hours, and twenty-three minutes.

But I know I'm still not free at all. And neither is she.
