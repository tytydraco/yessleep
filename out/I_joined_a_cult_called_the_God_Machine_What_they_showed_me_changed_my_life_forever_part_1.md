I had been working as a private detective for three years when the most bizarre case of my career landed on my desk. A mother and father were worried about their missing daughter, stating that she had joined some new “religious movement” and hadn’t been heard from since.

“What’s the name of this ‘religious movement’?” I asked, a deep feeling of unease rising in me.

“They call themselves the God Machine,” the mother said. “I tried asking her about it the last time I saw her, but she was elusive. Wouldn’t answer any of my questions, either. She just said her boyfriend had already joined and gone to live with the fellow believers, and that she would be following in his footsteps.”

“Do you think your daughter has, in reality, joined a cult?” I asked. Her father nodded gravely.

“It sounded like a cult to me, Detective Larson,” he said. “They refuse to talk to people who leave the cult, or who aren’t part of it- except for the recruiters and leaders, of course, who *have* to talk to outsiders, so as to grow their little nest.” He rolled his eyes slightly at this, his frown deepening.

“And they keep them in this huge complex in the middle of the woods. I’ve tried looking around, but their security is extremely tight.” He handed me a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it. “I’m afraid that Chrissy may be… well, dead. Or maybe kidnapped. We haven’t heard from her in over six months.” I nodded, taking notes.

“I’ll find out what I can,” I replied, not having much hope of recovering her alive after so much time had passed, but not saying it out loud. “She is an adult, and sometimes, in cases like this, we end up finding them living in a different area under another name. There is no need to assume the worst.”

Her family was wealthy, and they were willing to pay whatever it took to discover her fate and bring her back home, if possible. After all, they still had some hope- there had been no bodies discovered, and she really could just be living off the grid somewhere.

“So I’ve been thinking about joining up with your religion,” I said to one of the leading members of the cult, who introduced himself as Dax. He nodded, his eyes a cold gray color. He smiled wide, but the smile didn’t touch his eyes in the slightest. Getting an appointment to meet with him was relatively easy, as they seemed interested in converting new members as fast as they could.

“Oh, we don’t really call it a *religion.* We think of it more as a spiritual movement, a gathering of friends around a common purpose.” he said. “The God Machine allows a way to directly experience the divine. It is what every religion promises, but we actually deliver. We want to show this gift to the world… as soon as it is ready for it, anyway. Until then, we are just building up a small crew of like-minded individuals, including, perhaps, you.” His face turned serious as he looked at me.

“So what is this machine anyway?” I asked. “Is it something that alters your brainwaves, or…” He made a hand gesture like he was shooing a fly away.

“No, nothing like that,” he said. “You’ll have to experience it for yourself. There is no way to communicate what exactly the God Machine is. Even to call it a machine is just part of the limitations of language. But take a look around the complex and get to know some people.” I smiled, rising from the chair and leaving the office.

As I shut the door behind me and began going down the hall, I noticed strange paintings and poetry on the walls. The paintings were actually very good, but nonetheless, they looked eerie. Some of them showed countless eyes. Others were of something with four faces, one facing in each direction of the compass. The faces were all horrifying to look at- massive fangs with saliva dripping down from its gaping maws and pure black eyes that seemed to stare into me. Wings like those of a dragonfly with strange symbols burned into them protruded from the robed body. At the top of the painting, I saw the words “MY SOULMATE: THE ANGEL OF DEATH” written in calligraphy.

Intrigued, I read the poem beneath it.

*The Angel of Death*

*Takes my heart out.*

*She’s beautiful and young,*

*Eternal.*

&#x200B;

*My heart drips,*

*Her mouth opens wide,*

*The blood runs free.*

&#x200B;

*She shows the truth, eyes flashing.*

*She smiles wide, mind knowing.*

*Where she takes me,*

*I always want to go.*

&#x200B;

*The sweet rotting burial ground,*

*The place where we all meet.*

*She is my lover.*

*She does what*

*No one else can.*

&#x200B;

*It’s all I crave:*

*The sweet grass,*

*The smell of dirt,*

*The worms eating away*

*This old skin.*

&#x200B;

*And the worms*

*Sing and sing,*

*Just two words:*

*“You’re home.”*

&#x200B;

“Well, *that* was disturbing,” I whispered quietly. I stopped looking at the artwork and poems after that. I smelled something delicious down the hall. The clatter of forks and knives drew me to a dining hall where dozens of people sat.

Most of them were young. They weren’t all dressed alike or wearing any identifying insignia. It could have been the dining hall of a college campus, except for the paintings on the white concrete walls. I saw more paintings of angels with twisted smiles and insectile wings, black eyes and claws for fingers.

I grabbed a tray and filled it with food. It was a buffet-style set-up with chicken, steaks, pastas, fresh bread, fruits, coffee and many desserts. I wondered who paid for all of this. They hadn’t asked me for a dime when I talked to Dax. The thought occurred to me that they would try to indoctrinate people first before asking for money. Either that, or they had some mega-rich donors. The land this compound stood on extended for hundreds of acres, and the entire building looked brand new.

I found a couple people at a table, a woman and a man, and I sat next to them. They smiled blankly at me, their eyes looking empty and tired.

“Hi,” I said, returning the smile. “My name is Joe.” They introduced themselves in turn as Alex and Mary. “So how do you like living here?”

“Oh, it is just beautiful,” Mary said, her eyes seeming to stare through me. “What we have here is like nothing I had ever thought possible. I tried experimenting with a few religions before I found this place, but it was all rituals and memorizing random bullshit that never helped me find any peace. And some of them were straight up scams. I tried joining Scientology for a little while, but they just kept asking for money.” Alex nodded.

“If you want to see what makes this place holy and unique, wait until after lunch,” Alex said. “We’re going to run the God Machine. And it’s mandatory for all new people to attend. You’re going to see everything for yourself. I bet in the future, this place will be a site of pilgrimage for millions of people.” A small glint of fear seemed to pass through him as he told me this, but it was gone in a moment. They proceeded to talk about the trails and wildlife while I ate, and before I knew it, there was an announcement over the intercom.

“Will all members please gather in the great hall?” I heard the voice of Dax say before cutting off suddenly. Everyone rose, a murmuring susurration echoing through the hall as the low chatter of so many people combined into one noise.

I followed the crowd through the winding, endless hallways of the complex until we came to a room the size of an auditorium. What I saw at the far wall made my breath stop.

It looked somewhat like an archway, but not one any human ever built. It had dozens of black strands of organic-looking tendrils that intertwined the entire way to the topmost point. Each of the tendrils was the width of a pencil, and they all seemed to shiver slightly, sending unified waves running through the exterior of the machine up to the top. The only thing I’ve ever seen close to it were from science-fiction movies.

“My brothers and sisters,” Dax began, scanning the room slowly. “Some of you know what we have here. We call it the God Machine, and we follow what it shows, and we see the truth.

“But it is no machine built by humanity. I doubt whether humanity will be able to achieve this level of technological success within the next hundred years.” Nods of agreement spread throughout the room. I stared blankly at this madman, not knowing where he was going with this rambling introduction. He moved closer to the God Machine.

“If you do not wish to see what is contained here, now is your last chance to leave. We will not hold it against you.” No one left, and he pushed his right hand into the vibrating black strands of the archway. They began to glow white. The light spread up and down throughout the entirety of the arch, and the interior portal began to fill with blinding colors. Deep blacks mixed with blood-reds, tropical blues and vibrant greens. Everyone stared deep into the doorway, hypnotized by the colors mixing and shimmering there. The smell of ozone and sulfur began to fill the room.

Some of the cultists had a look of ecstasy in their eyes, others a look of sheer and total terror. One of the cult members, a chubby young man standing in the corner, fell down to the ground suddenly, his eyes rolling back in his head as a seizure overtook him.

Then I felt it. A presence was watching me from within the archway, short beams of lightning filling the doorway as it zoomed forever within itself into a fractal vision. Red, glowing eyes filled the machine, starting at tiny pinpoints and then expanding to fill the portal. These burning eyes kept growing until they overtook the wall of the room, then seemed to continue growing until they took over the entire sky and then the observable universe.

In that moment, I saw eternity, and I trembled, nearly collapsing from the horror of it all. The shimmering light rushed into the room, so bright I could no longer see the other cult members or the walls or anything besides the emanations from the archway. I felt nausea rising within me, and I expected to either collapse or start vomiting at any moment.

“Joseph Larson,” the fractal light said to me in a very slow, deep voice filled with power, rushing like a waterfall through my ears and overtaking my mind. I couldn’t think. I could barely remember who I was. I felt my ego dissolving, a primal terror filling me beyond anything I had ever imagined. Beyond the colors, I saw millions of legs on the body of the thing, writhing and moving like the body of an infinite centipede.

Its eyes filled with hatred and coldness beyond anything I had ever imagined. Its consciousness seemed reptilian, insectile. It was the type of presence that could kill billions of people, wipe out entire planets and feel the greatest joy at its destruction. With every dying star, it must have rejoiced.

“Why do you come to me?” the voice asked from everywhere and nowhere.

“I don’t know,” I whispered. “I want to go back.”

“Of course you can go back,” it said to me, “but I created you. I am eternal. I am the eater of worlds. Where will you run? With a single thought, I can send the angel of death to take you.”

“I thought God was supposed to be loving and compassionate,” I said. He laughed, a disturbing sound like the grating of metal. I covered my ears, closing my eyes against the pain until it passed.

“You are all my slaves,” it said, “and when you die, you will simply return to another body to die again. There is no Heaven. I created you simply to watch you suffer. Being alone for eternity can drive one… a little bit mad.” I felt my sanity slipping, and fell to the ground.

At that moment, the leader of the cult must have pressed his hand back into the archway, turning off the God Machine. In a blur, I saw the lights draining away, like water down a drain. The room turned back into its previous look- a fairly empty auditorium with just an alien archway and many people in a semi-circle. I found myself on my hands and knees, and a couple seconds later, I was throwing up all over the floor. After it had passed, I looked around again.

Some of the cult members in the room were on their backs, looking up at the ceiling and crying. A couple others had bad nosebleeds, and they were on their knees, trying to keep their heads back, their eyes still vacant and shell-shocked. But the chubby man who had fallen early looked worst of all.

As Dax sobered up from the experience with the God Machine, he shook his head, like a dog who just left a freezing cold lake, and walked towards his fallen cult member. Dax put two fingers on the man’s jugular to check his pulse, then licked the back of his hand and held it over the man’s mouth, trying to feel the smallest sensation of breath.

He shook his head again.

“He’s dead,” he said. I was still bleary-eyed and pale from the experience, but at least now I might be able to find out what they did with their dead comrades- and what happened to Chrissy.
