I arrived in Morhill on the final week of autumn, expecting nothing more than silence and darkness. The sky was a deep, starless black when I stepped off the bus, a chill running through me as I clutched my bag tighter. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and rotting leaves. 

My arrival was met with silence. There were no welcoming faces in the village square, no lamps to guide the way. Only the narrow dirt path that wound through skeletal trees, leading up to the village inn. I’d come to Morhill to study a peculiarity in the night sky that only appeared over this part of the countryside—a subtle shifting of stars, one that had puzzled astronomers for decades. 

A sign, crudely painted, hung over the inn door: The Hollow Hearth Inn. As I pushed the door open, a gust of stale, smoky air greeted me. The innkeeper—a wiry, narrow-eyed man who introduced himself as Wallace—studied me with the same suspicion I’d seen from every local peering out from their windows as I arrived. 

“You’ve come a long way for… stargazing,” he said, as if the word itself was a joke. His tone suggested he found the stars far from worthy of attention, and something in his expression hinted at a deeper reason. “What you’ll find here…” He trailed off, almost visibly swallowing his words. 

“I know,” I replied, doing my best to ease the tension. “I’m aware of the local stories. I’ve come prepared.” 

Wallace's eyes narrowed further, casting a long shadow across the dim bar. “You know nothing, stranger. The Hollow Stars aren’t your average sky.” 

 

Over the next few days, I became familiar with the village's rhythm, its customs, and its people. Superstition ran through Morhill like an infection. Every house had bundles of dried sage hung above the door, and strange symbols were carved into the windowsills. Every dusk, villagers would hurriedly gather in the square to light a bonfire, each mumbling prayers as they threw bundles of herbs into the flames. They called it the Warding—a rite performed every night since any of them could remember. “To keep us safe from the Hollow Stars,” they’d whisper, their voices trembling as they watched the darkness creep over the village. 

I dismissed these as eccentric folk traditions. Still, that first night, I felt an unease as I lay in my bed at the inn, listening to the wind scrape at the window. When I finally drifted off to sleep, my dreams were thick with shadows. Dark figures with hollow eyes drifted in the empty fields, looking up to the stars with faces twisted in silent horror. 

 

My work began in earnest the next night, equipment in hand as I made my way to the nearby hill where the sky was at its clearest. But as I set up my telescope, a gnawing sense of wrongness settled over me. The sky was alive with stars, brighter and closer than I’d ever seen. The constellations seemed out of place, skewed, as though the entire dome of the heavens was somehow shifting. I felt watched, even hunted, as I stared through the lens. 

One of the stars blinked. Just for an instant, but I was certain of it. 

I lowered my gaze and froze. A figure stood at the edge of the clearing, barely visible in the dim light—a hunched, gaunt figure, draped in rags and shadows. When our eyes met, my skin prickled with cold dread. 

“Are you… one of them?” the figure rasped, their voice a whisper against the night. 

“Who?” I stammered, my voice trembling. 

“The Called. You’ll know soon enough.” And then they were gone, retreating into the dark woods. 

 

The days blurred together, each one bringing new horrors. Every night, the stars grew brighter, their light sharper, piercing. And every night, I saw things that shouldn’t be there—people lurking in the trees, their eyes as hollow as the stars themselves. 

By the fourth night, I had stopped sleeping, my nerves fraying, each shadow thick with malice. Wallace grew pale when I told him of my experiences, shaking his head as he muttered about the folly of “inviting the Hollow Stars' gaze.” 

“You keep looking at them,” he whispered urgently, “and they’ll start looking back. They’ll see you. They’ll call you, and there won’t be anything left of you to come back.” 

On the fifth night, I was pulled from my bed by an urge I couldn't explain. I found myself walking through the village, past the houses with their barred windows, past the hollow-eyed stares of the few villagers peering through the glass. Each window had a bundle of sage, thick and dark with soot, as though they’d been burned and re-burned, night after night. 

The path led me back to the hill, where my equipment lay abandoned. My hands were shaking as I adjusted the telescope, trying to steady myself. I didn’t know what I expected to find up there, only that some instinct drove me on, a compulsion more profound than curiosity, deeper than fear. 

But as I peered through the lens, what I saw was beyond comprehension. 

The stars were… wrong. They pulsed and shifted, forming shapes that I could feel more than see. An intricate, alien constellation, slowly twisting in ways that defied geometry, forming eyes, spirals, voids that seemed to swallow light itself. The longer I looked, the more I realized these stars weren't stars at all. They were openings—holes punched into the fabric of the universe, leading to something alive and ancient on the other side. 

In that instant, a dark, yawning terror overtook me. These were the Hollow Stars, the very things the villagers had spent generations warding against. And they were looking back at me. 

One of the stars flared brighter, its gaze boring into me. A sound filled my ears, a low, vibrating hum that was as much a feeling as a noise, reverberating through my bones, a wordless whisper. You see us. The thought seemed to slip into my mind unbidden, foreign and cold, like fingers brushing against my brain. You are chosen. 

I staggered back, collapsing onto the grass, gasping for breath as I felt a surge of dread. My mind reeled as I scrambled to my feet, the stars still watching, pulsating as though they were breathing. Without thinking, I tore down the hill, heart hammering, their cold gaze heavy on my back. Even as I ran, I could feel them pulling me, an invisible tether that seemed to wrap around my mind, binding me to them. 

 

The villagers sensed it the next day. They could see it in my eyes, I was sure. Wallace refused to speak to me, his face twisted with something between pity and horror. The other villagers shunned me entirely, refusing to meet my gaze as they hurried past. 

That night, as dusk fell and the villagers gathered for their Warding, Wallace pulled me aside, his face pale and drawn. “You must leave, now, before they take you.” 

I shook my head, barely hearing his words. “They’ve already found me,” I whispered, my voice hollow. “I’ve seen them. I… I heard them.” 

Wallace’s face drained of color. “Then there’s nothing I can do. Just… stay inside. And whatever you do, don’t look at them. They’re… hungry. They’ll take anything you give them. Hope, fear, memory… They’ll hollow you out from the inside.” 

He left me then, joining the others in the square. I stayed behind, as he’d asked, barricading myself in the inn. I sat in the dim light, trying to steady my breathing, but the hum of the Hollow Stars was already filling my mind, a dull, endless thrum, growing louder with every beat of my heart. 

The minutes dragged on, and my resolve weakened. Something about their call was irresistible, like a soft song on the wind. Before I realized what I was doing, I was at the window, gazing into the night sky. 

They were waiting. 

The Hollow Stars blinked to life, brighter than before, their cold, watchful gaze filling the heavens. I couldn’t look away. Their pull was stronger than anything I’d ever felt, a compulsion deeper than fear, stronger than reason. I felt myself slipping, memories blurring, as if the stars were reaching into me, pulling pieces of me away. The names of people I’d loved, the places I’d visited, the things I’d once cared about—all slipping from my mind like sand through fingers. 

And then, the voice came again. Come. 

 

I was walking before I knew it, drawn down the path that led to the forest, the stars overhead guiding me like cold, gleaming beacons. The trees loomed taller than I remembered, casting long, twisted shadows over the path. The deeper I went, the colder it became, a chill that seemed to sink into my bones, sapping every thought, every feeling, until I felt as hollow as the stars themselves. 

Somewhere in the dark, I became aware of figures moving alongside me—pale shapes, drifting through the trees, their eyes dark and empty. They were watching me, faces blank, expressions frozen in mute horror. I realized with a shudder that these were the Called—the villagers who had disappeared, taken by the Hollow Stars. Their bodies were still here, but they were empty, shells wandering aimlessly, lost to the darkness. 

The path wound deeper into the forest, until I reached a clearing where the trees fell away, leaving only the endless sky above. And there, in the center of the clearing, was a circle of stones, each one carved with strange, angular symbols that glowed faintly in the darkness. 

I knelt in the center, unable to resist the urge any longer. The sky was alive with light, each star pulsing and writhing, forming shapes that twisted into a grotesque, inhuman face. The face stretched across the heavens, its eyes hollow and cold, filled with an endless hunger. 

You are ours, the voice whispered, echoing through my mind. You belong to the stars. 

 

When they found me the next morning, I was still kneeling in the clearing, my eyes fixed on the sky, my mind empty. The villagers pulled me back to the inn, their faces grim as they whispered prayers, pressing bundles of sage into my hands. But it was too late. I could feel it in every hollow inch of me—I was no longer whole. Part of me had been taken, devoured by the Hollow Stars, leaving me as empty as those who had gone before. 

Every night since, I’ve felt their call, a silent whisper that fills the darkness. I try to resist, but I know it’s only a matter of time. I see the others sometimes, drifting through the village, their faces blank, eyes as hollow as the stars. Soon, I’ll join them, lost forever to the cold, endless night. 

And the Hollow Stars will keep watching, waiting, hungry as ever.
