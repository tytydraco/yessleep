I'm not saying I saw my immortal philosophy teacher's memories three nights ago-- but that is exactly what I am saying. 

Bound in chains, my [professor](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14qslf5/my_philosophy_class_just_created_the_first_vampire/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2) was on his knees on white tiles soaked in pooling, seeping scarlet. When he tried to move, something cynched around his neck and dragged him back. In front of him was a young man in his mid-twenties. Brandishing dark brown hair pulled into a ponytail, wide green eyes, and a sculpted face like he had been made from marble, the man was beautiful. 

He was strapped to a slab of cement, straining against withering rope. The man's eyes were wild and frenzied. Terrified. Before a figure appeared from the shadows, taking slow and intimidating steps towards him. Ren. The name lit up my thoughts as well as escaping my professor’s lips in a pained whine. His cries were suffocating my throat, his agony thrumming through my veins and setting every nerve ending on fire.

“Ren!”

Again, he was violently pulled back and his hands went to his throat to scratch and pull at what was choking the breath from his lungs. I thought they were chains. They felt like chains. But when his—and my fingers grazed over what was choking him, they only pricked on gentle petals and thorns. He lunged forwards in an attempt to save Ren, but the figure whose face was hidden in shadow, held up a vial of something which sloshed against plastic before forcing it between the man’s lips, holding his nose when his body reacted in an attempt to spit it out. I saw the transformation before my professor. I could already sense it when he put his head down and squeezed his eyes shut. Lips stretching into a feral cry, sharp incisors slicing through canines. 

Professor Jackson did not lift his head and I didn't blame him. Ren's screams of fright twisted and contorted into vicious snarls-- and when my professor did manage to lift his head, he wasn't looking at the man he loved. Instead, there was a shell in his place; a monster lunging left and right, twisted into that of an animal. 

Vampire. But there was something different about Ren if I compared him to Charlie. Ren's eyes were still human blue, not that ignition of orange. He might have been a vampire, but this was a different type. Ren was not turned naturally like Charlie. Instead, his transformation looked… oddly clinical.

The surroundings, from what I could gather, was a laboratory in its very early stages in what appeared to be the 40s or 50s.

My suspicions were confirmed when my professor was dragged into a room filled with bodies, what I presumed were failures of these so-called experiments. Stepping over the squirming, ravaged flesh of men, women, and children lying in dried blood, mangled corpses, and people who had been picked apart piece by piece, and decapitated heads piled on top of each other, he dropped to the ground, resting his head on his knees, praying that death came to him. When those heads began to move, lips mouthing silent cries, I realized they were like him—and most likely, Ren was like him. Immortal. And whatever this place was, its sole purpose was to either eradicate or turn immortals into vampires. I didn’t see much after that. Varying flashes of colors and changing landscapes morphing from dark tunnels to city streets and buildings told me he’d gotten away.

Without Ren.

I thought the vision was over before I got another flash, this time sending me to my knees, my brain boiling itself into a fucking stew. The worse the pain was, the clearer the vision. This time I wasn’t seeing through my professor’s eyes. I was seeing through mine. The vision was blurry and confusing at first, hard to make out. I saw a figure coming towards me in slow strides, only for me to take staggered steps back. I wasn’t completely sure of the location but I recognized the stage in our lecture hall at the corner of my eye. 

The dull warm glow that had always comforted me reflected in all-too familiar eyes ignited orange, and the smile which had always been reassuring was now pulled back into an emotionless grin bearing teeth sharper than Charlie’s. I stumbled backward, or at least future me stumbled back, only for the vampire to wrap his fingers around my throat, pressing enough pressure to send black spots dancing across my eyes. 

It was so close to death, almost reachable, and I felt my future self’s pleasure at the thought of finally embracing the oblivion I had been craving since being cursed with mind-melting headaches. When the door opened behind me, his identity finally swam into fruition, no longer drowned by shadow. Jack. I should have known from the mess of curls and freckles which had always attracted me to him whether I liked it or not. It was Jack. When he got closer, I realized I was seeing the remnants of him, the hollowed out, inhuman monster with his face. 

That same vine-like darkness, tendrils of poison I saw writhing under Charlie's skin, spider webbing black creeping up the curve of his neck. He reached out, twining narrow fingers around my throat and slamming me into the door, knocking the breath firm my lungs. What used to be his usual scowl had twisted into a grin regarding me like a piece of meat, sharper incisors curled into the fangs of an animal slicing through his canines. 

Looking at him, the emptiness in his eyes and expression which spoke of no lingering humanity, feral insanity let loose and unbridled, writhing in hollowed out eyes. They were darker than Charlie’s. Instead of the newborn orangy yellow I now associated with a vampire, they were more of a blood orange. While Charlie’s eyes were frenzied and frantic like a wild animal, Jack seemed calmer and more put together.

I could have sworn the blood-orange color in Jack’s iris was bleeding into the whites of his eyes, even his pupils. 

I opened my eyes, finding myself standing in front of my kitchen sink with a knife protruding into my wrist. The pain continued like a sentient being, leeching itself to every part of me. I wanted to get rid of it, but knowing my skin would sew itself back together no matter how many times I stabbed myself, made me feel sick to my stomach. Something warm and wet dripped down my chin, and when I gingerly swiped at my lips, my sleeve came back deep red. Until now, the visions I had were mute or barely comprehensible with little context. Like rewinding an old movie, a confusing flicker of color and faces slamming into me like waves of ice-cold water. 

Immortality is not what I thought it would be. It’s not a gift my philosophy professor forced onto our class. It’s a curse. The burning inside my head had reached a point that landed me on my bathroom floor, curled into a ball with my clammy forehead uncomfortably pressed against the cool relieving porcelain of my toilet. The memories had started out like usual, triggered by an ignition of flames turning my brain and my thoughts inside out, before collapsing into whatever… that was.  

I thought I could get used to it; the endless burning, the visions of long-dead immortals tortured and ripped apart, and the realization I would never die. That I would keep going until the end of the universe, or at least until I find some idiot who would gladly accept immortality. I saw my professor’s memories which I could understand, but why did I see Jack? 

Was that his future?  

I thought I could block it out or distract myself with mind-numbing Netflix shows. But I had definitely underestimated this thing. I was only halfway through a reality TV show I was in too much pain to remember the name of before I found myself choking up the coffee I’d managed to swallow down several hours earlier. Like all human food and drink, it tasted like cardboard. But it was familiar, and that is exactly what I needed to stop myself from going fucking crazy. 

Ever since accidentally turning new boy Charlie into what we presumed was the first ever vampire in existence, my classmates and I had no choice but to lock him up to avoid him turning the student body into his own personal buffet, café-de-human. 

Jack had found an abandoned classroom in the college’s basement—and that had become our sort of base. Our only experience with vampires so far has been movies and TV shows. So, Miri pointed out that we had to soak Charlie’s restraints in holy water. It had taken four of us and a ratty cloth filled with chloroform to get Charlie’s ass on the chair, and even then we still weren’t completely safe from him. Immortality does not protect you from compulsion, and Charlie may have been a new-born feral monster who could barely speak distinguishable English, but in his desperation to get out of his restraints, he had already managed to compel Eve into loosening the ropes tied around his wrists, so we blindfolded and then gagged him with duct tape soaked in garlic. 

Presently, with my head still stuck to my toilet bowl, the burning was getting worse, and my professor’s memories grew progressively more intense until they were suffocating me, a bright and brilliant ignition I could see in the backs of my eyes. It wasn’t just his memories I could see. I could feel everything he had felt, his anger and hopelessness, his agony swallowing me up. He went back for Ren, but nothing was left of the place he’d been held captive in. 

When more memories slammed into me, I had to bite through my tongue to stifle a screech ripping from my throat. April always told me in order to distract herself from the pain of chemo, she forced herself to think about something else. So, with my mouth filling with blood and screaming obscenities into my toilet bowl, I recalled my last conversation with Charlie. Jack, who had appointed himself as our leader, had handed out shifts to make sure someone was always guarding our new… pet. I guess you could call him a pet.

I was on the evening shift, so as soon as class ended, I was forced to look after him for five hours.

The storage closet was tiny, so it was a squeeze. And believe me, being stuck inside a suffocating closet with a feral monster, regardless of being immortal, was terrifying. Though we did what we could to make him feel at home, I guess. Miri had found some carpet so we wouldn’t be sitting on cement, and Casper had offered to set up his laptop so Charlie wouldn’t be bored. I didn’t mean to be a doomer but quickly pointed out that Charlie wasn’t even aware of his name. When we spoke to him, he just snarled and spat at us. 

Jack had set up a beanbag so every guard was comfortable enough, and I just played on Noah’s switch he’d left behind after his earlier shift. But then Charlie started talking. 

Our impromptu leader had put together a report we had to fill in after every shift which recorded whether Charlie had spoken clearly or acted like himself. The thing is, we didn’t know the initial Charlie before he was turned, so we weren’t really sure what his “normal” behavior was. 

What we did know is that he seemed like a nice guy who smiled at everything and was enthusiastic when it came to group discussions. He joined our class and then died of an anaphylactic shock before any of us had really gotten to know him. I had two previous shifts earlier on in the week which were pretty boring. I fed him half of a paramedic’s arm and completed my duties which consisted of checking to see if his restraints were loose and applying a fresh strip of duct tape to his mouth. My shift had ended with not much going on. This time, however, he was talkative. And not “talkative” in the way we expected. 

Whatever we did, none of us could let our guard down. Miri had already pointed it out with a swoony kind of smile, but vampirism had definitely changed Charlie’s appearance.

Pre-dying, he had walked into our class as a regular-looking human with dark brown hair he definitely tamed with his fingers, a fairly normal face, not much of a jaw, and dull blue eyes which sometimes caught the light. In the movies, vampirism turns people into these perfect beings with unnatural beauty and hourglass figures. That’s not what happens in reality. Instead, they look more or less the same. 

But it’s their aura that messes with your brain and makes you think they’re the most beautiful beings imaginable. 

Charlie looked like an average human. 

Meeting his eyes, however, he drowned my thoughts, had one hell of a jawline, and a fanged grin that compelled me to get closer. It was only when Eve was pulling me back with a hiss, did I realize he’d wormed his way into my thoughts. I guess while I’m here, I’ll let you know that vampires are a lot like mythical sirens. They’ll lure you in with their supposed beauty and charm, and they’ve ripped you to pieces before your brain can even register it. 

I was on my phone mindlessly scrolling through my Twitter timeline, when I sensed the boy shift in the chair. Ever since losing the ability to die, I had come to realize I had slightly heightened senses. I could sense the new boy’s movement before he had fully sat up, and smelled the body odor coming off of his shirt practically glued to his flesh. We had meant to change his clothes at a point, but none of us had the guts to even attempt it. 

And it’s not like he would let us. 

I wondered if vampires showered.

Charlie had been quiet for most of the night, allowing me much-needed peace. I checked and re-checked his restraints to make sure they were tight, before sinking into the beanbag and committing myself to finishing Noah’s previous Pokémon battle. 

“Why did you choose philosophy?”

His voice startled me,  a smooth murmur prickling the hairs on the back of my neck. When I lifted my head, the vampire was sitting up straight, head inclined. He’d managed to tear through the gag with his teeth, and I made a mental note to tell Jack we needed something stronger. Still, though, his state intrigued me. It was the most human he had looked. And he was actually speaking, not snarling or gnashing his teeth like an animal. 

I was told to report every speech pattern and not engage, but it was the first thing the new boy had said since we turned him. Which made me wonder if he’d regained his mind and memories. 

I did get a glimpse of his human awareness when I first found him after he’d massacred our replacement professor. At that point, he seemed confused and scared. I don’t know what happened between then and now, but at some point, Charlie had willingly turned away from his humanity and embraced whatever we had turned him into. 

For a moment, I didn’t know what to respond with. Especially when he was acting human. His fangs, which were his defence mechanism when any of us got close to him, were nowhere to be seen, his head cocked to the side, reminding me of a puppy dog. I said Charlie wasn’t vampire-attractive, but he was still easy on the eyes, a mess of dark brown bedhead, pale skin and amber eyes. When I couldn’t bring myself to answer such a mundane question, he spat the remnants of tape hanging from his lip. “Well?” His frenzied gaze followed me as I slowly rose from the chair, sliding on the raybans I had been fidgeting with.

“You’re okay,” I managed to get out.

It was the most human he had ever acted, considering a day earlier we had to physically pin him to the chair when Noah cut his finger on an old nail. Now, he seemed like the same boy we had all been envious of. Charlie even had that smile, alleviated by sharpened incisors now sticking from his mouth in a fanged smile. “Answer my question."

“What?”

“You chose philosophy,” he murmured, playfully kicking his bound ankles. “Why?”

Ignoring every instinct inside me telling me not to engage, I made sure to step as far away from him as possible. “I don’t know,” I said, which was the truth. I had been fearing death my whole life, so I guess I joined to face my fear of the inevitability of it.

When I told him that, he startled me with a laugh. "Ha. That figures."

“What do you mean?”

“You joined this class for no other reason than to waste time questioning what ends up being meaningless in the end,” Charlie murmured. “You people make me sick. Why do you continue to question life as if there's one big genius answer? Philosophy students, and the subject as a whole, are a fucking farcse."

“What?” Slumping into the beanbag, I relaxed slightly. “You do realize you’re dead, right? You ate peanuts and died of anaphylactic shock. I’m confused why you’re the one laughing at us."

Charlie rolled his eyes. “I don’t give a fuck, to be honest,” he said. “What did you say killed me?”

“Candy,” I replied. “You were eating peanuts.”

He nodded, his lips spreading into a grin. “Say it again.” Charlie leaned forward on the chair, his eyes wide. “I want you to tell me how I died again.”

This was getting kind of weird, but sure, I’d humor him.

“Peanuts,” I said, and when I met his grin, something twisted in my gut. I leaned forward, suddenly intrigued by what appeared to be a nihilist vampire. “I’m sorry, did you….” 

“Yep.” Charlie tipped his head back with a sigh. “From birth, I was made to die. Everything dies, and we’re too stupid to realize that our lives are far too short, weighed down by shit that doesn’t matter,” he straightened up, his gaze flicking to me. “I wanted to show you that all your lives are meaningless no matter how many discussions you have on the so-called meaning, and why we live and why we die, and why we keep on overpopulating and fucking up this planet, this universe, which only exists because of X, Y and Z. We are only here by chance, and you want to study it? You want to understand something that does not and will not ever exist?" he leaned forward, this time spitting out the words, “I wanted to sit in front of you all and prove to you that your words and your debates, and your workbooks filled with pretentious shit is all meaningless and null,” Leaning back in the chair, Charlie’s lips curved into a smirk. 

“You killed yourself,” I said in a breath, “To prove a point?”

Charlie shrugged. “I was dying, anyway,” he murmured, “Doc said I had maybe a few months if I was lucky. The tumor was too big to be operated on, and even then the surgery could have killed me." His words made me feel sick. If I had known about the existence of immortality back when April was alive, would I have given it to her? 

"I just… quickened my stoop to mortality, I guess," Charlie continued. His eyes narrowed, and he struggled in the chair, hissing when his bare skin chafed rope. “Now, imagine my confusion when a group of philosophy students turn me into a fucking bloodsucker.”

“That was an accident.”

He cocked his head. “So, you *accidentally* snapped my neck and forced blood down my throat?”

“We didn’t snap your neck.”

His lip curled. “I remember in clarity having to snap my neck back into place when I woke up. Some asshole clearly did not like me.”

“So, the nice guy thing was an act?"

“No. I was just excited to mess with your heads."

I frowned. “You think killing yourself in front of philosophy students is some genius move that will be remembered?”

Charlie shook his head. “No,” he blew a raspberry, “But if you guys weren’t blood-sucking freaks, you would have been forced to watch me choke to death with no way to save me,” his lip quirked. “Ironic, huh? You spend days arguing over pointless shit instead of living your lives and actually doing something interesting before this abstract world implodes underneath our feet, and some stranger just happens to drop dead right next to you, dying a meaningless death after a mediocre existence.” he sighed. “I guess you could say I wanted to change your perspective. Maybe drop the pretentious attitude and fuck philosophy."

“Perspective?” I couldn’t resist a snort, “You knowingly put yourself into anaphylactic shock!”

“Well, it didn’t work, did it? You idiots brought me back.”

I folded my arms. “I regret bringing you back. You’re a sociopath.”

“You shouldn’t have," his lips curled into a snarl, his human demeanor melting away. Charlie straightened in the chair, nose flaring, eyes blazing striking red. “Because I’m hungry, Tee,” he murmured. I felt a prickle in the air, his attempt to slither his way into my mind. I took another step back, this time shutting my eyes. “The professor and paramedics weren’t enough.”

His voice was like… honey.

No. "*Chocolate.*

“Do you remember your name?” I asked. 

“I don’t need one.” 

In hindsight, I should have noticed the slight softening of his tone. “Have you checked on Jack and Eve lately?”

Something ice-cold slithered down my spine. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

Charlie’s grin was both the feral snarl of a vampire and the poisonous spite of a human. Though if my gaze had strayed on him for a minute longer, I would have noticed he too seemed to be in silent distress. Instead of answering, he pressed his lips together and smiled, and because he was a stubborn little shit, Charlie didn’t speak another word. 

The vampire’s words were still thrumming through me when I had made my peace with my toilet seat, lifting my head from the cool porcelain. The pain had numbed slightly, and that was enough to send me to my feet. I grabbed a towel to wipe my bloody mouth and flush the toilet, but when my gaze caught the toilet bowl, there was no blood. I remembered in clarity coughing up mouthfuls of endless scarlet splashing on clinical white. 

I remembered trying to clean it with tissue paper, the floor underneath me pooling red.  But there was nothing. I swiped at my mouth— which was clean. I was frowning at my bathroom floor when a knock sounded, startling me to fruition. Eve was standing on my doorstep looking pained, her expression contorted, lips curled.

She didn’t even have to say it. I already knew what she was going to say from her expression. But the way she was keeled over was far different from what the headaches usually did to us. Eve’s face was ghostly white, her wide eyes barely penetrating me.

“Charlie,” I said, already shutting and locking my door, following my classmate to her car.

Eve didn’t respond, but her body language told me everything I needed to know. Jack was in the driver’s seat, his forehead pressed into the wheel. When I jumped into the back, he jumped, like he’d been woken up. When I caught his expression, he too looked like he was in pain. I was just happy to see him looking human—and not whatever the fuck he was in my vision. Jack’s eyes were their usual human brown, which was a sobering sight. He stamped on the gas, gripping the wheel. “He was taken an hour ago,” he said stiffly, his voice more of a growl, “I headed to my shift and found Casper and Miri torn apart.”

“Fuck.” Leaning over his seat, I couldn’t resist a hiss, “Are they okay?”

Jack shot me a look in the mirror. “Duh. They can't die. But the bastards took Charlie.” He took a sharp turn, and I almost face-planted the back of his seat. 

“We’ve managed to track him down to an abandoned art store downtown, so that’s where we’re going.” He exhaled a breath, and I could see the whites on his knuckles as he tightened his grip. “I’m guessing our professor wasn’t the only one of his kind, and whichever bastard took Charlie is using him as bait to lure the rest of us.”

“Track down?” I sent Eve a look. “How…?”

The girl didn’t look at me, her gaze on a straying raindrop sliding down the windowpane. “It’s hard to explain,” she said softly, “We just… know.”

“You just know?” I wanted them to elaborate on their “just knowing” Charlie’s location before Jack was pulling up at a rundown-looking store with broken windows and spraypainted doors. When the two of them jumped out, I had no choice but to follow them. 

“This is a bad idea. You said they took Charlie as bait, so why are you walking into a trap?” I hissed out when Jack stuck his hand through splintered glass and broke the lock off of the door. The boy shrugged and sent me a sickly smile I could just about make out in the hollow light. Jack told me he wasn’t leaving without Charlie, and I had a hard time understanding why a 19-year-old philosophy student who several weeks ago couldn’t give a fuck about any of us—was throwing himself into harm’s way for the new boy who had already proved himself to be an asshole. So, as well as losing their humanity, I was 100% sure my classmates had lost their sanity too. 

Or Charlie had compelled them. 

Maybe both. 

Eve followed Jack through the door and I joined them after hesitating. The place was pitch black. I was ordered to look for a light switch before Jack used his phone as a flashlight, illuminating a nefarious-looking door that practically screamed, “Do not open”.

“Jack.” I said in a whisper-growl when he advanced towards the door, “Are you fucking crazy?”

“Shh.” He murmured. “I can smell him.”

“I’m sorry, what?”

The boy finally twisted around to glare at me. He flashed the phone light in my face, and I waved it away. “Do you want to wait outside? You're making noise."

I was about to answer but the words choked in the back of my throat when the door flew open before Jack could grasp the handle. Eve let out a squeak and grabbed my hand, and Jack stumbled back several steps before seemingly remembering nothing could really hurt him. The figure appearing in the doorway did not have a face, a silhouette drowned in darkness. The lights flickered on and after being temporarily blinded, I found myself looking at a suited man who looked to be my dad’s age—maybe older. No sign of Charlie, which wasn’t good. I thought the guy was going to introduce himself before he pulled out a gun. 

Normally, I wouldn’t care for a bullet piercing me because the damn thing would just pop back out like a cartoon. I had come to realize that during multiple games of Russian roulette with Noah, who was into some freaky shit—and freakier shit when he no longer had that barrier of death standing in his way of his fun. Before I could understand what was going on, the suited man was shooting us each in the leg, which crippled us, sending us to our knees. 

It took a single moment for me to understand it wasn’t a bullet that pierced my knee, and a further to realize it was a dart. Drugs? I didn’t feel dizzy or lightheaded. I reached to pull it out, frowning at a tiny vial of blue fluid that had been injected into my bloodstream. Shooting a look at Jack and Eve, they seemed equally perplexed. It was when the suited man opened his mouth that I understood what these things were.

“Names.”

Like we were going to tell him our--

“Jack Whitlock,” Jack responded almost automatically in a strained hiss—and when I met his eyes, I could see his face twisting and contorting.

Eve bowed her head and seemingly was able to stop herself for the better half of a minute before the words came streaming out of her mouth in a pained whisper. Like someone had reached down her throat and ripped out her vocal cords. "Eve Grey."

The words came out of my mouth like I was being choked, an invisible hand was reaching down my throat and pulling out each syllable, one by one. "Tee Clairemont."

Truth serum.

I didn’t think such a thing existed, and yet that was all I could think of—a solution injected into the bloodstream which forced you to answer questions truthfully. I expected a vampire army who kidnapped Charlie, and I’d gotten the supernatural CIA.

The man cleared his throat. “I see,” he said. “You are Alex Jackson’s students, I presume. I’ve heard a lot about you—or more so that he’s been planning to make you scapegoats for a while. I must ask though because I am curious. How exactly do you exist?" He folded his arms. "Your species is practically extinct, and I should know. We were on the frontlines butchering every last one of you before your oldest ancestors were even an idea-- and it baffles me how Jackson could have made so many of you in little time."

When Eve attempted to reply, she squeezed her eyes shut, instead bending over and choking up glistening red that dripped from her chin. Her body seemed to move on its own, collapsing into a bowing motion.

“I didn’t say the girl could speak,” he said. His eyes flicked to Jack. “You were in possession of a fully blooded natural vampire,” he murmured, “How?”

Jack lifted his head. From his wide eyes, and lips attempting to press together, I could tell he was trying and failing to keep his mouth shut. 

“Professor Jackson created us by forcing us to consume his corpse after tricking us into telling him he wanted to live forever. Charlie was the new boy, and we hated him—like we really hated him. I hated him. I hated that he was allowed to live a normal life while we were haunted by flashes of past immortals, or whatever the fuck our teacher was. So, when he died, we accidentally turned him into a….” when Jack let out a sharp breath that twisted into a cry, I had no doubt those words had been forcefully ripped from his mouth. When blood dripped down his chin and stained the collar of his shirt, I had to look away. “We turned him into…” Again, he stopped, seemingly fighting against whatever force was clawing into his mind.

“Into..?” The man was clearly enjoying the pain in the boy's face. “Spit it out. I do not have all day.”

“Vampire.” Jack finished in a strangled hiss, ducking his head. “We… we turned him into a vampire.”

Nodding, the man stepped forward. “And who exactly created this… Charlie?”

“Me.” Jack spat out, this time trying to slam his hand over his mouth to no avail. His hands just fell to his sides. “I force fed him my blood.”

“And me,” Eve whispered. “I bit him.”

“So, it was a joint effort,” the man nodded with a satisfied smile, regarding us like trophies he was planning to use for decoration. “Not only am I face to face with three of your species, a whole new generation of what your professor has been hiding from us—but we also have two fledglings who have created their own offspring.” His words sent my stomach into my throat, and I caught Jack and Eve’s reactions. Eve mouthed, “Ew, no.” and Jack curled his lip in disgust. 

The man’s eyes lit up. “Tell me,” he murmured, adopting a more serious tone. “Are you aware that you have just created the first naturally-born vampire since we decimated them?” 

He crouched in front of Jack, poking the boy in the forehead. “Immortality comes at a cost, which is vampirism, a disease of both the mind and body. It starts slow, writhing through you like a parasite. Some people think it is simply mother nature telling them that they do not deserve to live past their sell-by date.” He moved onto me, his warm breath tickling my face. “What you have so nonchalantly created is the last stage of immortality brought on by boredom and bloodlust. It is what you monsters turn to when you already have the ability to live through the ages and no longer have death as an obstacle." something ice cold crept down my throat when I thought back to our own hunting sessions for pure thrill.

"It is the pure, animalistic beast inside of you who prays on human flesh, massacring entire towns for their own personal enjoyment. It is humanity untethered and raw and hollow of emotion. They feel nothing and exist as nothing, except the primal urge to kill.” The man straightened up. “All of them wiped from the face of the earth before they could bleed into our own people."

“But not all of them,” Jack surprised me by saying. “You said it’s a disease, but not all of these immortals catch it, right?”

He nodded. “True,” the man said. “Some never give in to those vampiric urges. They don't need to. However, we can’t take the chance. All of them, vampire or not, had to die.” 

He held something in the air, waving it under the light. I almost face-planted. It was the gilded knife our professor had killed himself with. With the man being so close, and in the possession of something which could legitimately kill me filled me with a cocktail of terror and excitement. His gaze found mine. “Your professor, however? We have been searching for him.” He inclined his head. 

“After ridding the earth of these immortal creatures, we of course studied them and created our own.” I thought back to Professor Jackson’s memories. That must have been when these people had been trying to forcibly turn immortals into their own soldiers. The suited man fixed us with a smile. 

“After decimating the majority of you, we were left with a single drop of your blood. Which we used in an attempt to recreate it, but it was lacklustre at best." his eyes flicked to Jack. "Your professor is, or was, an incredibly ancient and powerful being whom we have been pursuing for a long time. With his blood, we can make thousands of what your friend is.”

His lips quirked. “Fully blooded, better, stronger, and more… well trained.”

Another step toward us, and I actually felt afraid for the first time in a long time. All it took was him swinging the blade, and my short second life would be over.

“Can you guess what I’m going to say next?”

The truth serum must have been wearing off because neither Jack nor Eve spoke, and words no longer crept up my throat like barf.  This asshole wanted our professor’s blood. Not the blood from our veins, his pure, untainted, immortal blood which had turned us. “Charlie isn’t a threat,” Jack whispered. I could tell whatever freaky exchange which had happened between him and the new boy, was influencing his emotions. Eve looked on the brink of collapse like a mother losing her child.  “He’s just a friend.” His voice cracked. “He was an accident.” His tone turned icy. “And in case you haven’t noticed, Jackson is dead.”

“An accident born from negative emotions. Anger. Jealousy. Envy. You wanted him to have your fate. Which is a cruel act for someone you supposedly care about.”

Jack’s face fell. He opened his mouth, but no sound came out.

"We had nothing to do with his death.” I spoke up.

The suited man shot me a look, and I quickly understood that I wasn’t involved in this conversation. The man was clearly interested in Jack and Eve. I, however, was expendable. “Yes, but  you intentionally fed him your blood in an attempt to make him like you. Which is just as bad, if not worse than killing."

I wasn’t expecting Jack to suddenly snap, especially when his veins were pumped with truth serum. “I’m sorry, are you judging us?” he spat, jumping to his feet, dragging Eve along with him. I lurched back when he attempted to pull me to my feet too.

“Jack,” Eve spoke through gritted teeth. Ignoring her, the boy laughed.

“Are we in fucking court?” He stepped forward with challenging eyes. “Sure. Whatever. We can get Jackson’s blood for you, I’m sure him being dead and literal dust won’t be a problem.” He was practically oozing sarcasm, and I started to wonder if I was really going to die. “I’m sure he keeps it somewhere so yeah, we’ll get it.” Jack stepped back. “Just let our friend go.”

The suited man regarded my classmate with amusement. “You’re a funny man.”

Jack cocked his head. “Oh, I am? Thanks. Let Charlie go and I’m sure we can come to some kind of agreement.”

“That’s not going to happen,” he said. “What is going to happen, is you’re going to stay here for a while. Call it… collateral.”

 “What?”

“We need to get out of here,” I hissed. "The vampire isn't worth it, trust me."

“Not without Charlie!"

I caught desperation in his tone, an overwhelming and almost inhuman urge to rescue the vampire.

"Charlie is a sociopath," I gritted out, "The asshole played us, and I'm pretty sure he's passed saving."

Jack turned to me, blinking rapidly, his lips curved into a question, before his head lurched back. The crack of a gunshot almost sent me to my knees. Then another. 

I slammed my hands over my ears, waiting for the sudden burst of pain erupting in my chest and my own loose breaths. Jack dropped to the ground, followed by Eve. Twin gunshots in their heads, almost in exactly the same place piercing their forehead. I knew they wouldn’t be down for long, but these guys weren’t shooting to kill. They were shooting to capture. “You have three days.” The suited man said as armed guards surrounded me, picking up my classmates and throwing them over their shoulders. The man regarded me with a look of boredom.  “Bring me the blood of your professor, or I’ll be keeping all three of them. The fledgling, and its reluctant creators.”

If I wasn’t an immortal freak, I would have nodded and run for my life. But a gunshot wouldn’t hurt me. 

“I’ll bring you what you want,” I said stiffly. “But if you fuck with either of them, I’ll pour it down the drain.”

The words came out before I could swallow them. It couldn’t be the truth serum, right?

What was I saying? I barely know them. Why did I care? 

I started to walk away before warm breath was on my neck, cold hands wrapping around my throat. “I know you can’t die, you disgusting excuse for a living thing,” the suited man said with a snorty laugh, “From what I gather from your kind, I can understand your craving to die. However, with a young person such as yourself, I can't imagine you would be so tired of life just yet." He sighed. "The new generation intrigues me. Squeeze the life out of her, and take her home.” 

The grip on my neck tightened, and black spots danced across my vision. It felt… so good. Pleasure filled me and I was drowning in that sensation. I was going to die. Not for long. But I was going to die, and I could revel in that relief. I was aware of blazing eyes piercing the dark, straying strands of hair tickling my shoulder. My head hit the wall, my thoughts dancing, sharp nails pulverising the flesh of my neck. 

It felt so good. To fall deep down, to plunge into nothingness which wasn't burning. Somehow, the man who had kidnapped my classmates, and our pet vampire, had given me exactly what I wanted. “Tell your cohorts three days,” the suited man’s voice rattled in my skull.  “And thank you once again,” I could hear the smile on his lips. “For delivering three perfect experimental subjects.”

His last words took me far into the abyss, and beyond that.

When I woke up, I was lying in our college’s reception, almost like I’d been delivered directly to the door. It was pitch black outside.

Noah was looming over me, or more specifically, three dancing Noah’s.

I blinked and was left with his wide eyes several inches from mine. “Tee?” my classmate's expression was twisted with worry. He prodded me in the forehead.  “What the fuck just happened?”

…

I’m still trying to figure that out myself. @justhegirlnextdoor please help us. You hinted that you are one of us and I need to know what’s going on. You don’t have to trust us, obviously. But we’re scared. If this blood even exists, where is it? And have we really lost Jack and Eve? Why do they even care about Charlie?! The guy is a total nut!
