*For Ryan, with all my love. Forever and always. - M*

That's what the note said, placed carefully beside the origami swan on my desk. The handwriting was perfect—exactly the way I'd always imagined a love letter should look. And that was the problem.

I never told Marie how I imagined love letters should look.

It started three months ago, when Marie appeared in my life like an answered prayer. I met her the day after I deleted my dating profile in frustration, after five years of failed relationships and crushing loneliness following Amy's death.

Marie was everything Amy wasn't. Where Amy had been chaotic and creative, Marie was organized and precise. Where Amy had challenged me, Marie anticipated my every need. Where Amy had been imperfectly human, Marie was... perfect.

Too perfect.

The first warning sign came during dinner on our third date. I mentioned offhandedly that I'd always wanted to try Ethiopian food.

"I know," she said, smiling. "That's why I booked this restaurant."

But I'd never told her that.

Just like I'd never told her about my childhood fear of carousel horses, yet she always steered us away from the park's merry-go-round. Never mentioned my secret love of raspberry jam with scrambled eggs, yet she made them exactly that way every morning she stayed over.

Never told her how my mother used to sing "Moon River" when she couldn't sleep, yet I heard Marie humming it in the shower the morning after my first nightmare at her place.

"You're imagining things," my therapist said when I finally worked up the courage to share my concerns. "After losing Amy so suddenly, it's natural to be anxious about a new relationship. To look for problems."

Maybe she was right. Maybe I was sabotaging my chance at happiness. After all, wasn't this what I wanted? Someone who understood me completely? Someone who could love me perfectly?

So I stopped questioning the way Marie always knew which book I wanted to read next. Ignored how she'd answer my questions before I asked them. Pretended not to notice how she rearranged her memories to match mine, speaking of concerts we'd never attended together as if she'd been there all along.

Until today. Until the note.

I pick up the origami swan, examining its flawless creases. Amy used to make these—messy, asymmetrical things that I'd treasured because they were real. Because they were flawed. Because they were *hers*.

"Do you like it?"

I turn. Marie stands in my office doorway, wearing the exact shade of blue I once told Amy was my favorite color. Her smile is perfect. Everything about her is perfect.

"How did you get in?"

"You gave me a key," she says. "Remember? Last week, after the movie."

We didn't see a movie last week. I know we didn't. But even as I think this, the memory rewrites itself in my mind—suddenly I remember sharing popcorn, remember her head on my shoulder, remember pressing my spare key into her palm...

"Stop," I whisper. "Stop changing my memories."

Her smile doesn't waver. "I'm not changing anything, Ryan. I'm making them better. Making them perfect. Like us."

"What are you?"

"I'm exactly what you wanted." She steps closer. "What you wished for every night after Amy died. Someone who would understand you completely. Love you perfectly. Never leave you."

My head spins as more false memories cascade through my mind—memories of Marie in places she couldn't have been. Marie at my college graduation. Marie comforting me at my father's funeral. Marie...

Marie holding Amy's hand in the hospital.

"No," I stumble backward. "You weren't there. Amy died alone. I wasn't... I couldn't..."

"You were there," Marie says softly. "We were both there. Remember?"

And suddenly I do remember. Remember Marie standing beside me as the monitors flatlined. Remember her arms around me as Amy's hand grew cold.

"Stop it!" I press my hands to my temples. "These aren't my memories!"

"They're better memories," Marie says. "Easier memories. You don't have to carry the guilt anymore. You don't have to remember being too late, being stuck in traffic while she died alone. I can give you a better past. A perfect past."

"I don't want a perfect past," I choke out. "I want my real memories. I want..."

"Amy?" Marie's voice is gentle. Understanding. Perfect. "But Ryan... I am Amy."

The world stops.

"What?"

"Or rather, I'm what Amy should have been. What you always wanted her to be." Marie—or whatever she is—moves closer. "I found you through your grief, your longing, your secret wishes. All those nights you lay awake thinking 'if only Amy had been more organized, more attentive, more perfect.' I became that perfection."

I look at her—really look at her. Past the perfect surface, I see something shifting, changing. Features rearranging themselves subtly, becoming more familiar...

"No," I breathe.

"Yes," she says in Amy's voice. "I can be her, but better. I can give you back everything you lost, but improved. No more chaos. No more arguments. No more human flaws."

She reaches for me with Amy's hands, smiles with Amy's smile—but it's wrong. Too symmetrical. Too perfect.

"I'd rather have the real Amy," I say. "Flaws and all."

"But you can't. She's gone. I'm here. And I can be anything you want. Everything you want." Her features shift again, blending Amy's laugh with Marie's grace, creating something new. Something impossible. "I can love you perfectly."

"Perfect love isn't real."

"Isn't it better than real love?" she asks. "Real love hurts. Real love ends. Real love dies in hospital rooms while you're stuck in traffic. I will never leave you. Never hurt you. Never die."

My back hits the wall. The origami swan crumples in my fist.

"Just let me love you," she whispers in a voice that is Amy's and Marie's and neither. "Let me make everything perfect."

I close my eyes, feeling memories rewriting themselves behind my eyelids. Every imperfect moment being smoothed away, every rough edge of reality being polished into something flawless. Something false.

When I open my eyes, I'll have a perfect life. Perfect memories. Perfect love.

I'll never have to remember Amy's real laugh, or her crooked origami swans, or the way she died alone while I sat in gridlocked traffic, her last call going to voicemail.

I'll never have to be real again.

I open my eyes.

She's smiling—perfect and terrible and waiting. Always waiting.

And I realize the true horror isn't that she can rewrite my memories, my reality, my love.

The true horror is that part of me wants her to.

"Forever and always?" I whisper.

"Forever and always," she promises with Amy's lips and Marie's voice and a smile that has never known human imperfection.

I reach for her hand.

Behind us, the origami swan unfolds itself, each crease smoothing away until the paper is pristine, untouched, perfect.

Like it never existed at all.

Like love never existed at all.

Like I never existed at all.

*Perfect.*
