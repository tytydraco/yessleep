This is my confession, nothing more, nothing less. I’ve done terrible things. Shit I’d never have the guts to admit if I weren’t at the end of my rope. My name’s Daniel C. Kane, and soon I’ll be gone, but I’m leaving this story as a protest against myself. If you’re ever on Route 17, past the rusted factories and the forest that’s too damn quiet, don’t stop at the old warehouse. 

***

1983 was the year I put a gun in my mouth and tried to end it all. I was 24, broke, and drowning in heroin addiction. Heroin softened the world’s edges. Sobriety burned them raw. 

My loved ones were gone, my mother had cut me off, gotten the police involved, and slapped a restraining order on me. I couldn’t even step near her crumbling house in that decaying Midwest town without risking the can. A sob story, I know. 

The gun I had was a snub-nosed .38 revolver, a rusty piece of junk I traded a gram of heroin for. It came with three bullets, scratched and dull, but I figured they’d do the job. I was in a rotting apartment, walls peeling, mattress stinking of mildew or semen. Neighbors screamed through the walls, and my heart pounded like it’d burst before the bullet. 

High on adrenaline and dope, I shakily placed the barrel between my teeth and pulled the trigger.

Click.

Nothing.

The damn thing jammed. I yanked it out. At that point, a strong quiver had taken over every part of my body as I moved the gun to my temple, and tried again. 

Click.

Another jam. 

I collapsed, soaking in piss and tears, my voice cracking as I broke into hysterical laughter. Third time’s the charm, I remember thinking to myself, but I had not dared anymore.

Believe it or not, I was raised without faith. My parents were militant atheists, their only gospel cold, indifferent logic. As a kid, I remember mocking the Christian kids in town, their little crosses weighing them down with promises of salvation. So imagine the madness of me stumbling, delirious and desperate, into a decaying church on the town’s edge, chasing salvation myself, in something I never believed existed.

Pastor John took my confession. “Free yourself, my son.” He had said. I sat down and spilled everything, starting from my childhood to heroin, the gun, and the whole mess. I remember his reaction - no reaction at all. He had leaned forward, his voice firm, and told me that it was God’s intervention. “God’s hand, my son. He has plans for you.” I wanted to believe him. I needed to. So I went cold turkey—no drugs, no alcohol, no women. I became reformed, God-fearing, a regular at the pews, preaching redemption to anyone who’d listen. But it didn’t last. Over the years, I started seeing the cracks. Pastor John was skimming cash from the donation plate, swapping hollow sermons for seductions. The church wasn’t salvation—it was a sham, a con dressed up in stained glass. I walked away, bitter and disillusioned, thinking I could do it better—certain I could do it better.

If faith were a game, I’d learn the rules. And then I’d rig it.

1987. 28 years old, semi-clean but restless, pacing the skeletal streets of my dying town. Rusted factories, cracked sidewalks, and an endless forest that seemed older than sin. That’s where I met Sarah. 25. An artist with storm-tossed eyes and a habit of vanishing into her sketchbook. We bonded over whiskey and wounds, and one night, I introduced her to LSD. That’s the same night she mentioned the name.

“Vespera,” Sarah whispered, her voice quivering like a frayed thread, “the Veiled God. It spoke to me in my dream…”

Her pupils were black voids, swallowing the dim light of her apartment, her hands trembling as if touched by something unseen. Her belief pulsed like a heartbeat, raw and electric, but it chilled me. The air felt wrong—thick, humming faintly, as if the walls were listening. I was high too, LSD sharpening every edge, yet I stayed cold, calculating. Her hunger, that desperate gleam in her eyes, was a door opening in my mind. I saw a chance to become something more, and so I acted.

“Sarah,” I lied, leaning close, the air thick between us. “It spoke to me, too. Vespera… it chose me as its voice. I am its vessel.”

I half-expected her to laugh, to see through the lie, but her eyes shifted, widening, glistening with tears, as if I’d torn open a wound. She clutched my hands, her grip feverish, her sobs jagged like she’d lost something vital. I continued feeding her faith, each word stoking a fire in me.

By spring ’88, I’d founded the Order of the Veiled Eye in a derelict warehouse on Route 17. Concrete floors. Boarded windows. A basement that stank of earth and old blood. The place hummed with wrongness — a hum you could feel in your teeth. But it was cheap. And I needed a stage. I started with twenty drifters, addicts, and strays like me. By the next summer, we were fifty. Sarah was my Seer, her eerie, alien sketches of Vespera lining the walls. Blacklight revealed them in hellish glory — veiled, multi-eyed, its tendrils writhing like smoke. She painted during rituals, moving as if in a trance, while the others worshipped both god and artist.
I preached that Vespera was a god of secrets, watching from a shadowed realm, rewarding the faithful with visions, punishing the doubters with darkness. Every word was calculated, designed to hook them deep.

I learned their weaknesses. Jenny, 19, fleeing a predator father. Mike, 35, drunk, shattered, desperate for meaning. I became their god’s prophet, their anchor. I held “Confession Circles” where they spilled their filth for all to hear. It broke them. Made them mine.
Their wallets emptied into my hands. Savings, jewelry, even wedding bands. Everything for the “greater good.” No phones. No visitors. Only the Order. Only me.

I was untouchable, a king in a kingdom of my own making. Sarah was my queen, her faith in Vespera unshakable, even as I fed her lies. I’d tell her private “visions” at night, whispering about Vespera’s plans, keeping her hooked. But I wasn’t stupid—I knew I was walking a tightrope. One slip, and they’d see the truth. So I tightened my grip. If someone doubted, I’d shame them in front of the group, call them “unworthy,” make them fast for days to “purify.” If they pushed back, I’d spread rumors—say Vespera marked them as traitors. A few left early on, but most stayed, too scared or too devoted to walk away.

The Sanctum was our cathedral — the basement, damp, cold, lit by trembling candlelight. At its heart, Sarah’s masterpiece: a ten-foot portrait of Vespera. Eyes like wounds. A veil of shifting, oil-black tendrils. 
I’d chant nonsense in a made-up tongue. They’d sway, weep, laugh — unmoored from themselves. Each week, I’d select a “Chosen” for visions, dosing them with LSD, just enough to open cracks in their minds. They’d crawl back raving of eyes in the dark, and the rest would beg on their knees for their turn.

I was a king in a kingdom of shadows. Sarah, my fever-eyed queen. I kept her loyal with false visions whispered at night. Manipulated, isolated, dominated. When a follower doubted, I shamed them, starved them, and branded them a traitor. Fear and devotion — that’s how you keep a god alive.

I’d stare at Sarah’s art, at those bloodshot eyes chanting my name, and a cold certainty would crawl up my spine. The shadows — they didn’t always move the way they should. The walls sometimes breathed. The basement would hum in a voice I hadn’t faked.

And one night, when the candles guttered low and the Sanctum stank of sweat, blood, and earth, I heard it.

Not through a speaker. 

Not through a drugged mind.

A voice—ancient, wet, and endless—rising from the black.

“Hear me."
