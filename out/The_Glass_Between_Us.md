The narrow alley folded in on itself. Each twist showing more vending machines, old wooden doors, lanterns buzzing yellow in the Tokyo night. Kenji led with that confidence locals have. I followed with the other backpackers from the hostel. Only known them three days. Kenji for barely 48 hours.

"You sure this is right?" Emma asked, her Australian accent cutting through the humid air.

"Trust me," Kenji said without looking back. "Tanaka-san's place is the best sushi in Shinjuku. Maybe all Tokyo. But tourists never find it."

I wiped sweat from my face. Six months ago, I wouldn't have done this. Six months ago, before Sarah left and took half my life with her, I planned everything. Now I'm following strangers through back alleys in a foreign city. Saying yes to everything. Trying to outrun the hollow feeling that followed me from Chicago.

"Here," Kenji stopped at an unmarked door. Just a small blue curtain hanging above it. No sign. No menu. Nothing to show it was even a restaurant.

Inside was smaller than I expected. Just a simple counter with eight seats. The chef's workspace behind it, perfectly organized. Bare wood walls. Dim lighting focused on the counter. Tanaka-san nodded as we entered. Old man with forearms like rope. Face giving nothing away.

"Told you it was hidden," Kenji whispered as we sat. "No reservation needed because tourists don't know it exists. Only locals and people who know locals."

I felt it then. That flash of belonging. Of being special. These people had included me. The chef started working without a word. His knife catching the light.

"We'll do omakase," Kenji explained. "Let the chef decide. It's traditional."

First course came without fanfare. Glistening fish on small rice mounds. Texture unlike anything I'd ever had. Dissolving on my tongue like sea foam.

"This is incredible," Emma murmured. Everyone nodded, lost in the food.

That's when I noticed the window.

Hadn't seen it when we entered. Large window facing the alley. And there, pressed against it, a face. My face. But wrong somehow. Watching us eat. When I stared at it, it didn't look away.

"Do you see that?" I asked. But the others were busy with Kenji's explanation of soy sauce technique.

By second course—Tanaka-san splitting open a sea urchin, orange insides vibrant under the light—there were three versions of me at the window. All slightly different. One smiling too widely. One with empty eyes. One just staring with such longing it hurt to see.

The chef worked with perfect precision. Hands certain as they gutted a squid. Translucent flesh quivering. Tentacles still curling even separated from the body. He arranged the pieces carefully, dabbing sauce so dark red it was nearly black.

I tried focusing on the food. But the window had become a gallery of my own face. Five versions now. Seven. Some smiling slightly. Some looking lost. All me, but not me. Watching myself eat with these strangers.

"Guys," I said louder. "Why are all those... people watching us?"

The group turned, then looked back at me, confused.

"What people?" Lisa asked.

"The window—there's like ten of me staring through the window."

Kenji glanced at the window, then back. "There's nobody there, man."

I turned again. My reflections pressed closer. Some smiling now. Some looking angry. Some with tears streaming down their faces. One mouthing words I couldn't understand.

"Are you serious? You don't see them?"

Emma touched my arm. "Ryan, there's nobody there. Just the alley."

Next course arrived—a fish still twitching as Tanaka-san drove his knife behind its gills. Its eye staring directly at me. Blood in delicate lines across the cutting board, which the chef wiped away with practiced efficiency.

"Maybe you're more jet-lagged than you thought," Diego suggested. Concerned but somehow distant.

The crowd at the window had grown. Twenty versions of me now. Some laughing at me. Some crying. One pressing his palm flat against the glass, leaving a foggy handprint. Another writing something in the condensation, backwards so I could read it from inside: "SHE'S NEVER COMING BACK."

Sweat beading on my forehead. Am I hallucinating? The chef sliced the fish's belly, removing organs with two fingers. The blood so bright against white porcelain.

"Excuse me," I stood suddenly. "Bathroom?"

Tanaka-san gestured toward the back without looking up from his work. I walked unsteadily, feeling my own eyes following me from the window.

In the tiny bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face. My reflection looked wrong—too pale, eyes too wide. I'd been so open with these people. Told them about Sarah that first night over beers. How she said I was too intense, too needy. How I'd smothered her. How I'd come to Japan to find something new, to become someone new.

Had they been laughing at me? Pitying the sad American with his broken heart story?

When I returned, the chef was blowtorching salmon skin, fat bubbling under blue flame. The window now completely filled with versions of me. Some had phones out, recording my humiliation. One wore the exact outfit I had on the day Sarah left. Another looked like me but successful, confident, everything I wasn't.

"Better?" Lisa asked as I sat down.

"Do you think I'm crazy?" I blurted out.

They exchanged glances.

"Of course not," Diego said carefully.

"Then why won't you acknowledge what's in the window? Is this some joke?"

Kenji put down his chopsticks. "Ryan, I promise, there's nobody at that window. Just glass reflecting the inside of the restaurant."

I turned again. A sea of my own faces stared back. More than could possibly fit in the narrow alley. Some looked concerned now. Some mouthed "GO HOME." Some wore expressions of pity that made me want to scream.

The chef placed another piece before me. This fish's eye followed me, accusing me of something I couldn't name.

"Maybe the sake was stronger than you thought," Emma suggested gently.

"I've had one cup," my voice rising. "I'm not drunk. I'm not crazy. I'm seeing myself—all these versions of myself—and you're all pretending not to see them."

The laughter from outside grew louder. I could hear my own voice, multiplied, mocking me.

"Ryan," Kenji said quietly, "there's no one there."

"Then what's that noise? The laughing?"

They looked confused. "What laughing?" Lisa asked.

The chef continued working, unbothered. Preparing fugu now, the poisonous blowfish that could kill if cut wrong. His knife moved with surgical precision, separating toxic organs from edible flesh. I watched, transfixed, as he arranged paper-thin slices in a chrysanthemum pattern.

My reflections pressed against the glass, breath fogging it in patches. Some were tapping now, trying to get my attention. One wore the sweater Sarah had given me last Christmas. Another held up a photo of her with someone else.

"I need to go," I stood suddenly.

"But we're only halfway through," Diego protested.

"I can't—I need air."

I fumbled for my wallet, dropping yen notes on the counter before pushing past the others. Felt their eyes on my back as I headed for the door, heard their concerned murmurs.

Outside, the alley was empty. No reflections, no watchers, just humid night and distant street sounds.

I spun around, looking everywhere. Nothing. Moved to the window and looked inside. Could see my new friends, their faces concerned, Kenji saying something with a worried expression. Tanaka-san continued his meticulous preparation, unfazed.

But there, at the end of the counter where I had been sitting, was another version of me—but different. This one looked calm. At peace. Connected with the others in a way I couldn't manage. He turned slowly to face the window, looking directly at me with perfect understanding. Then smiled, raised his sake cup in silent toast, and turned back to watch the chef's knife flash in the light.

I backed away from the window, heart racing. The reflections I'd seen—had they been warning me? Showing me what I'd become? Or what I could be?

Leaned against the alley wall, breathing hard. I could go back inside, rejoin the group, pretend everything was fine. They'd welcome me back with concern, inclusion. Connection. Isn't that what I traveled halfway around the world for?

But as I looked through the window once more, all I saw was my own face reflected in the glass—alone, fragmented in the panes, watching myself with countless versions of my own eyes. The version sitting at the counter, integrated with these new friends, seemed more real than the me standing outside in the dark.

Which was the real me? The one who could connect, or the one forever watching from behind glass?

I turned and walked quickly away into the maze of alleys, alone with the sound of my own laughter echoing off the walls.
