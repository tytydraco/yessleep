I always thought my art was a reflection of my soul. Each stroke of the brush, each line of the pencil, was a piece of me. My two kittens, Luna and Shadow, were my constant companions, their playful antics a source of endless inspiration. But lately, something strange has been happening.

It started with a painting I was working on late one night. The room was dimly lit, the only sound the soft purring of Luna curled up on my lap. I was painting a serene landscape, a peaceful forest bathed in moonlight. As I stepped back to admire my work, I noticed something odd. There, in the shadows of the trees, was a face. It was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was there. A face I hadn't painted.

I shook my head, blaming my tired eyes, and went to bed. But the next morning, the face was still there, clearer now in the daylight. Luna and Shadow seemed to sense something too. They sat in front of the painting, their eyes wide, fur bristling. They hissed softly, a sound I'd never heard from them before.

Days passed, and the faces began to appear in all my work. In the swirls of a stormy sky, in the folds of a flowing dress, even in the petals of a blooming flower. Each face was different, but they all shared the same haunting expression, a look of despair and longing.

My kittens' behavior grew more erratic. They would stare at my paintings for hours, their eyes following something I couldn't see. They stopped playing, stopped purring, and began to avoid me. I felt a growing sense of unease, a chill that settled in my bones.

One night, I woke to the sound of scratching. I found Luna and Shadow in my studio, clawing at a new painting I had started. It was a portrait of a young woman, her eyes filled with sorrow. As I approached, I saw that the face had changed. It was no longer the woman I had painted, but a twisted, tormented visage, its eyes boring into mine.

I tried to paint over it, but the faces kept coming back, more vivid and terrifying each time. I began to see them everywhere, not just in my art. Reflections in the mirror, shadows on the walls, even in my dreams. They were always watching, always waiting.

Desperation drove me to research the history of my house. I discovered that it had once belonged to a reclusive artist who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Rumors spoke of his obsession with capturing the souls of the dead in his paintings, a dark art that had driven him mad.

I realized with horror that I had somehow awakened his curse. The faces were the souls he had trapped, and they were using my art to escape. My kittens, sensitive to the supernatural, had sensed the danger long before I did.

I knew I had to stop painting, but it was too late. The faces were everywhere, their whispers filling my mind, their eyes haunting my every move. Luna and Shadow had become shadows themselves, their once bright eyes now dull and lifeless.

I sit here now, surrounded by my cursed art, the faces closing in. I can feel their cold breath on my neck, their fingers brushing my skin. I am trapped, just like them, a prisoner of my own creation. And I know, deep down, that there is no escape
