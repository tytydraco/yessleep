I used to work in a morgue it was a fine job for me as I was not very good at medical school  and in a morgue I couldn't hurt anyone but you still needed a medical license to do the job, it was well paid since all the bad doctors would prefer a different area than to spend time with dead bodies and since I was never a believer of anything like that then I never had to worry about being surrounded by dead constantly and in any case I was more worried about the strange people that would come around trying all type of trickery to get themselves a dead body.

&#x200B;

I have heard of bodies going missing and later they would appear in an abandoned house or in the woods probably used in different games that they called rituals and sometimes I was even called into places where they found dead bodies to corroborate if it was a previous dead body stolen from our facility.

&#x200B;

As strange as it may sound, dead bodies are a very profitable business.

&#x200B;

That's why it was so strange when she appeared in the floor that night and i'm sure she must have paid some money to the guard to get in and I would usually just called the guards again but as soon as she entered the door I was struck by Her and now is hard to explain why but she looked so fragile yet so confident in herself even though she wasn't the most attractive woman you can think off yet there was something in the way she walked or moved or the way her eyes looked at me that I couldn't took my eyes off her also she immediately smiled which made me even more harmless against Her.

&#x200B;

I let her in to my office and the closer she got to me the more I was willing to do anything she said I felt a strange yellow light coming out of her and pulling me in and there was this strange melodic sound filling the room I still remember how she turned her head to me and without saying anything I new she wanted me to come to her it was like we had some sort of telepathic communication and the closer I got to her I could see this yellow bright light coming from her getting brighter and feeding me this warmth, she touched me for the first time when she hold my hand and her big eyes stared fixed into my eyes and she told me that she was looking for a friend of her that she needed to carry to some other place and I immediately reacted by going through each of the dead bodies showing her what was available so she could take any one she wanted.

&#x200B;

She settle on one that had recently arrived he was a male body of around 45 years old he was intact because apparently according to my autopsy he had a heart attack so I started to prepare the body to be moved we set the body into a bag and carry it on to the morgue van and something happened to me at that point I remember that my body hesitated to continue and decided it was time to stay since I knew that nothing that was happening made any sense but she persuade me to come along it was as simple as giving me the right look for me to obey I still remember I had never felt such feeling of excitement so I drove them for some time arriving at a place I didn't knew it existed before without receiving any directions because it was like I just knew where to go and we arrived in this big house were everything around was dark probably because the other similar houses were empty so there was no light in the area except for the moonlight it felt like it was just an abandoned house that needed urgent restoration work like painting or gardening but without hesitation I went in.

&#x200B;

I took the body in as indicated and then I felt the instructions to lay next to the dead body. By now she was laughing and it was such a delicate sound coming from her.

&#x200B;

I felt my body getting tougher and tougher until I couldn't move it anymore and my eyes where getting more and more difficult to kept open and I could still hear her laugh at this time and a moment of clarity came into me and I didn't understand where was I and what was happening to me why I couldn't move then the laugh turned into the most horrendous noise I have ever heard.

&#x200B;

I then felt how everything went black and I could only hear someone slowly walking at a fast pace more like running in slowly I saw this thing coming to me he stopped and looked at me but it was so dark he just looked like a shadow of a human, his arms and legs were longer than usual and he just continue on his way until it disappear on my back, I went forward until I saw this small light that kept getting bigger the closer I got until it filled me completely.

&#x200B;

When I woke up I felt scared and I couldn't move but I could feel  I was being dragged through the floor I then tried to open my eyes and saw a blurry image of someone next to me and I felt how he was moving me down some stairs so I tried to move but my body was to heavy so even with all my effort I couldn't move a muscle, I realized by then that I was being dragged down to a basement and when I was down there in the dark I felt how my hand was locked to a steel pipe with a chain locked and after some minutes had passed I still couldn't move but my vision became more and more clearer so I could see the face now of the person that brought me down here.

&#x200B;

It was an old woman that seem to have some sort of skin rash all around his cheeks and neck I couldn't talk and she didn't seem interested in me because I saw her look at me but with such disinterest almost like if I was not even there so she left me in the floor and I saw how she went away only to come back some minutes later dragging this other unconscious body down the basement stairs I could see that he was awake because as soon as they were down she left him alone and he moved in a very unstable way like almost falling down on every step working hard on trying to get control of his mass he then went to the other side of the room and sat down, I couldn't see him clearly since the only illumination we had here was coming from a candle but I felt his stare looking at me and I could see him having occasional full body spasms that he tried to control with even more violent movements sometimes hitting himself against the wall by then I could barely move and stay awake but felt heaviness all over my body like it wanted to shutdown.

&#x200B;

He started bleeding because of him hitting himself but he seemed like he did not felt any pain it looked more like a rabid dog trying to beat his disease until it couldn't fight the heaviness anymore and fell to the floor I stayed awake for some seconds in the floor enough to see how he was standing up and coming my way and I felt scared and helpless like I had never felt before and I wished then I just wouldn't wake up again, from the reduced vision I had I could see this dark slim figure standing next to him looking like he was supervising his movements.

&#x200B;

When I woke up I didn't knew how much time it had passed I looked around and  the basement was dark and felt empty I could move and I tried and was able to make sounds with my mouth I noticed my voice sounded weird but at least I could make noises now then I heard noises coming from the up floor it was someone walking fast in the direction of the basement door and then I could hear the noise from a door opening and the light came in illuminating the stairs next I heard him walking fast coming down I noticed it was a heavy foot sound on the floor he was moving faster than before and more in control not like a human yet but more like a big animal learning to control his body, he came running to me and I didn't know if he was going to attack me because of the force he came to me but he stopped just in front then I was able to make a sentence and asked him if he could please release me but he didn't answer he just stood there I wanted to see his eyes but it was too dark to notice any details so I asked for water but got no response either then he left and later that day he came down and had a bag of raw chicken that he threw the at me but even if I wanted to I couldn't take it because my hands were tied down he saw this and got closer to me I could only say PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE in a quiet voice not even knowing what was happening.

&#x200B;

He took a piece of raw chicken and brought it closer to my face to try to force it into my mouth and with his other hand he took another piece and started to eat it himself  blood and transparent slime liquid started to come out of his mouth dropping into his chin he continued to bring the other piece into my mouth but I kept rejecting it so he finally got away from me and took the bag and sat down on the floor were he continued eating chopping all that raw white meat with his teeth and blood coming down from his hands more blood started to come out and I saw how he had started to byte and took pieces from his own hands but it seemed like even pain was something he wanted to experiment so he bite even harder into his hand into his own flesh all the time he was staring at me he tried to also speak but he was only able to make noises, sometimes he looked amicable and others he turned violent and I could see his bloody mouth and teeth.

&#x200B;

It felt like days had passed it was hard to tell since it was all dark in the basement and I could hear him upstairs walking and falling down constantly I could hear him making loud noises like an animal trying to learn to communicate and also the constant falling of things to the floor but lately he seem to be more in control but now there was a terrible smell growing in the basement it was like food going bad and god knows what things are down here with me then I heard him walking slowly and then running like he was going after something followed by silence for some minutes and after that the basement door opened up and he was walking like more in control of his body and his pants and shirt were full of food or blood and I noticed he was chewing again a raw piece of meat it seemed like a corpse of something that I couldn't figure out what it was he took a piece of it and threw it my way and I was hungry but couldn't even imagine eating such thing I saw him smile for the first time and went again back to the wall to continue eating he sat down in the floor and because he left the basement door open I could clearly see how his hands and teeth devouring and after a closer look I started to clearly see his face and I couldn't comprehend it at first but it was so clear there in front of me that I had no doubt of what I was seeing I felt for a moment like I was going to loose my mind trying to understand what was happening and this wave of shock started to affect my whole body causing my muscles to get all tense because he was there in front of me He was in my body and it was my face and the awful smell now made sense  I was the corpse She had taken my body.

&#x200B;

When I saw the open door of the basement I put all my effort and was able to release myself and tried to run away as fast as I could from that place I knew this was my opportunity and like a loose animal I stomped my way out of the basement feeling I was going to fall down on every step I took I then crossed trough the open door and desperately started to look for a door or a window anything were I could exit this nightmare it was all closed down from all 3 sides so I took the only open space in the corridor I felt the vulnerability of my situation not knowing what could appear on any turn in this house I felt trapped like if I was in a maze just trying to move away as fast as I could the noises came from down the basement and I assumed the creature was now coming to get me, every time I blinked I could see this slim black figured in front of me but when I opened my eyes there was nothing there I thought it was because of my desperation to get out of that place as I knew I would only had this opportunity I saw light coming from somewhere daylight I haven't seen in god knows how long I imagined a blue sky waiting for me and that gave me extra strength to continue running away.

&#x200B;

I crossed what it seem like a living room and in a corner there she was the black slim figure with his old and decrepit skin that looked like it was falling off of her and almost showing her bones her face looked more like a corpse with his eyes so submerged into the cranium and this long and misshapen nose in his almost exposed white cranium, she turned to face me and for a second looked surprise but then started to laugh hysterically that horrible noise I have heard before I didn't had much time left and I saw a door on the next room and ran for it and finally I exited the house and it was a clear blue sky I had imagined and I stopped and stand just some steps out like if my mind wanted to affirm if what I was looking at was real and then I saw the door opening again and this beautiful woman came out and stand out the door and after her my body came out and stood next to her, “He is mine!, He is mine !, He is mine” shouted her in a mocking tone and went back in.

&#x200B;

I hesitated on what to do but realize I was lost so I continue now to walk the streets as my new body is becoming more and more alive now I feel the pain of my condition with the exposed nerves and rotting skin I looked at myself only once and realized my end was close, I live now in the landfill out of the city where no one can see me just waiting for this body to die again.
