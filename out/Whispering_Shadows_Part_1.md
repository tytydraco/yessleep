I’ve never been one to believe in ghosts or spirits. I’ve always brushed off haunted house stories and Ouija board warnings as nonsense. But now, sitting alone in this cold, dark apartment, with the shadows pooling in the corners of the room, I wish I had taken it all more seriously.

It started a few nights ago at a party. It was one of those cheap beer, loud music, and too-many-people-in-one-space kinds of nights. My buddy Mike had thrown it together in his parents’ old house while they were out of town. The place was ancient, all creaking floorboards and peeling wallpaper. Someone mentioned the attic, and before long, Mike came stumbling down the stairs holding an old Ouija board.

“You scared, Jake?” he said, shoving it toward me. The board looked like it had seen better days. The letters were faded, and the wood smelled faintly of mildew. A small, triangular planchette sat neatly on top, polished from years of use.

“Scared? Of this thing?” I scoffed, but I could feel the heat of everyone’s eyes on me. A couple of girls were giggling nervously, and the guys were all smirking, waiting to see if I’d take the bait.

I wasn’t about to back down. “Fine,” I said, snatching the board from him and dropping it on the coffee table. “Let’s see what all the fuss is about.”

Mike and a few others sat down with me, while the rest of the partygoers circled around, whispering and recording us on their phones. I wasn’t nervous—at least, that’s what I told myself. It’s just a stupid game.

We placed our fingers on the planchette, and I cleared my throat. “Alright, spirits,” I said, trying to sound casual, “if you’re here, give us a sign.”

For a moment, nothing happened. A few people chuckled, and someone muttered, “Told you it’s fake.” I was about to call it quits when the planchette moved.

Not a small twitch. It moved.

“Who’s messing with it?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at Mike. He raised his hands in mock surrender.

“Not me,” he said, and everyone else chimed in, insisting they weren’t moving it either.

The planchette slid slowly, deliberately, to “H.” Then to “E.” Then “L.”

“Hell,” someone whispered. A nervous laugh broke the silence, but it didn’t last long.

“Alright, funny,” I said, my voice faltering slightly. “You got your scare. Let’s stop now.”

But the planchette didn’t stop. It kept moving. “H-E-L-P.”

The air in the room seemed heavier, thicker. The laughter and murmurs died away, replaced by an eerie, oppressive silence.

“Help who?” I asked, my voice quieter than I intended.

The planchette froze in the center of the board. Before anyone could say anything, the lights in the house flickered, then went out completely.

Someone screamed. I felt a rush of cold air sweep past me, and in the pitch black, I swear I saw something. A shape, darker than the shadows, moving across the room.

I fumbled for my phone, turning on the flashlight. The pale beam cut through the darkness, but it didn’t feel like enough. The room felt too big, the shadows too alive.

“Turn the lights back on!” someone yelled, their voice panicked.

I tried to speak, to calm everyone down, but before I could, I felt it—a cold, featherlight touch on my arm. My breath caught in my throat.

And then, I heard it. A voice, low and raspy, whispering directly behind me.

“You shouldn’t have asked.”

I turned sharply, the flashlight trembling in my hand, but there was nothing there. Just darkness.

That was the moment I realized we’d made a mistake—a mistake I might not be able to undo.
