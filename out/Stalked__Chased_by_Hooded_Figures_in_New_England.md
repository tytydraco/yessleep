In my early twenties, I was chilling at my best friend's house one evening when we decided to go on a sunset walk along her street. It was a muggy summer late afternoon, not too humid, it was just the right amount for New England.

As we made our way down Bedford St the sun was setting, we decided to walk on the bike path that connects to a side street that could loop us back around to her house. After passing the mouth of the bike path entrance the sun began to set, filling the sky with a velvety layer of darkness. We turned on our flashlights to do a quick sesh, but in the middle of it a biker with a headlight light on came barreling down the path. Taken off guard we both jumped. I quickly threw the device back into my pocket, as my friend suddenly turned her phone flashlight off to cloak us in darkness. After he passed we paused for a moment before bursting out into laughter, then continued on our way.

Then after walking a few paces, we heard a weird set of shrieks coming from the surrounding woods. We were deep within the wooded bike path now, with nowhere to where run but one direction, out. I tried to keep my calm, as we sped up our pace but the screams grew stranger. It sounded like an injured bird of prey or a distorted version of a fox's blood-curdling childlike cry. As the screams intensified we began to run, and both of us are fast as a whip luckily. As we rounded the corner before the mouth of the bike path meets a real street, we stopped out of breath. "What the hell was that?" my friend bellowed out. "I don't f\*\*\*\*\* know, maybe a hurt animal?" but we both knew something more sinister was probably going on in those woods. "Let's head home and chill out", I said as we made out way back to Bedford street, in the darkness, with the street lights as our only friends. That wasn't the creepy part of the story, the next part is...

We had just passed our favorite pizza joint when I noticed a man in all black walking behind us. I was always taught growing up to look out for my surroundings, don't wear headphones when walking alone, and always look behind me. "There's someone behind us" I whispered to my friend, turning again to gauge his distance and demeanor. 'He' was about 15 feet back, wearing a black hoodie, with the hood up, and black pants, in one hand was a plastic bag from the grocery store barely filled, and in the other was a long wooden staff (this concerned me).

We picked up our pace, as we made our way past the pizza joint and closer (30-45 ft) to the first entrance to the bike path that we had taken before. The street lights in this section are sparse, and we were in a patch of darkness when I turned around again to see where this staff-wielding man was. HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND US, less than a foot and staring directly into our souls, well I assume he was because I couldn't make out a FACE, it was all darkness. I screamed and so did my friend, in shock. We bolted across the road to the other side of the street.

This is where the story gets blurry, probably from a bit of trauma. The hooded man slowed down his pace, watching us as he continued walking on the other side of the street. I kept my eyes on him, as my friend began freaking out about the whole situation. Remembering what I was taught, I looked behind me and saw another hooded man bellowing toward us. Confused in pure terror for a moment, I looked across the street to find the first man chasing us, he was still there. Where did this second man come from? Was he hiding behind one of the trees that line the front of the Public Waste building?

We sped up, unsure of where to go and nervous, as we were about the approach the mouth of the bike path again. I could feel the adrenalin surging through every particle of my body. I turned again to check our surroundings, and this time both men were right behind us. I don't know how the first guy teleported across the street without both of us noticing but somehow he did. Staring up at the blank and empty hooded faces, I felt an unrivaled sense of absolute fear. "RUN" I screamed to my friend as I booked it into the middle of the street, the safest place I thought. In my frenzy to escape to the middle of the road, I didn't realize my friend was still on the sidewalk, frozen in fear, staring up into the 'faces' of both hoodied creatures. "Run, A please RUN!" I bellowed, but she was stuck, unable to move from the terror that she faced. I sped over to her, grappled her shirt until I clasped her arm, and pulled her back with me into the street. It took a moment for her to move, but she eventually broke from the paralyzed trance she was in.

As we ran down the middle of the street, I led us toward the warm neon lights of the closed pizza joint. Feeling that was the safest place for us, in public with plenty of light. I looked toward the area we had just run from, trying to scope out these creeps. They had both gone back to their respective sidewalks and were walking in unison until they both reached the two mouths of the bike bath that cut across Bedford street. In absolute shock we watched them both stop at the opposing path entrances, facing the darkness of the path. "Call your dad for a ride now, " I said quickly, "I don't feel safe walking past them or by the bike path again".

After hanging up we looked back to see both men had disappeared, we assume they walked back onto the bike path but can't be sure. Her dad showed up in his old green Ford pickup, pissed as hell that we had been terrorized and stalked. "They went down here?!" he exclaimed, pointing to the bike path, "yes" we both responded. He quickly drove his car into the mouth of one of the paths, turning on his high beams to expose them but nothing was there.

I am not sure if these hooded figures were human stalkers, human traffickers who sucked at their jobs, unusual Satanists, or supernatural. My hometown is 30-40 min away from Salem MA, there have been countless rumors about Satanists doing rituals in the woods along the bike path. I know a few Satanists myself that would never pull this crap, they are actually awesome people. The fact that I couldn't make out a face for either figure is what scares me the most. If anyone has any ideas or thoughts on what these figures could have been, please comment. This is only one of the many creepy situations that I have encountered with my friend 'A', we seem to be a magnet for the strange and bizarre. I have a few personal experiences with the supernatural as well, so I may share more accounts if anyone is interested.
