Im only 18, but I already feel like I’ve lived through a lifetime’s worth of emptiness. I thought I knew what love was supposed to feel like, but my home was always cold. My mom never once turned to me and said, “I love you,” and my dad’s been out of the picture since I was six. For years, I tried to convince myself it was normal, that maybe she just wasn’t the affectionate type, but it started to eat away at me. Every time I saw my friends with their families, laughing and hugging, I felt this gaping hole in my chest.

Over the last year, things got worse. Mom and I barely spoke, and when we did, it was like talking to a wall. She had this way of making me feel small, even when she wasn’t saying anything hurtful. The silence was louder than anything she could’ve said. It was suffocating, and I was drowning.

That’s when I did something I never thought I’d do. I hired a male sex worker. I was so desperate to feel close to someone, to feel wanted, that I didn’t care how I got it. I wasn’t looking for sex, though. I just wanted someone to hold me, to make me feel like I wasn’t completely alone. So, I saved up what little money I had from my part-time job at the gym  and contacted him. His name was Ricardo.

The first time we met, it was awkward. I’d never done anything like this, and I think he could tell. But he was kind, patient. He didn’t make me feel weird for asking to just sit with him, for asking him to hold me. It was nice, but it wasn’t enough. It still felt… empty.

By the third time, I decided to try something different. I brought a stack of flashcards with me, each one with a phrase I’d never heard in my own home. “You make me feel safe.” “You’re important to me.” “I love you.” I felt ridiculous, but Ricardo just smiled and went along with it. He read them back to me, his deep voice , and for the first time in what felt like forever, I felt… okay. Like maybe I wasn’t completely invisible.

We started meeting more often. It was like a drug. I’d count down the days until I could see him again, just to hear those words. I didn’t care if they were just phrases on a card, or if he was only saying them because I paid him. They made me feel alive.

But then, things started to change. Father was acting different. He started noticing me more, like actually noticing me. He would make comments about my clothes, ask where I was going. I even caught him staring at me once, with this strange look on his face that made me uncomfortable. The weirdest part was, he stopped being so harsh. It was like she was pretending to be nice, but I didn’t trust it.

One night, I went to meet Ricardo at the motel, like usual. But when the door opened, I froze. He was wearing this blue suit, the kind of suit my father would wear, the same style, the same way it fit. His hair was even done like my fathers, loose waves that she usually wore when she was trying to look more put together. My heart started pounding, and I could barely get the words out.

“Why… why are you dressed like this?” I stammered.

Ricardo  smiled, but it wasn’t his smile. It was like she was mimicking someone else. “I thought you’d like it. Don’t you remember? he used to wear this when she took you to school.”

A chill ran down my spine. “How do you know that?”

he didn’t answer. Instead, he just walked closer, whispering, “You make me feel safe.” The words from the flashcard, the same words I’d been craving to hear, but now they felt twisted, wrong. I backed away, and without thinking, I ran out of the room.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of it. I kept telling myself it was just a coincidence, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. I decided I wasn’t going to see Ricardo anymore. It was too weird, and I needed to focus on getting through my last year of high school without falling apart.

The next evening, I was in my room, trying to study, when I heard it. A whisper, right next to my ear, so soft I almost didn’t catch it. “You make me feel safe.” I shot up, my heart hammering, but there was no one there. Just the dark, empty room.

I tried to convince myself I was imagining things, that I was just tired, but I knew better. The next day, I went back to the motel, needing answers, even though every part of me was screaming not to. When I got there, Ricardo was already outside, waiting. But he looked different. he didn’t just look like my father; he was acting like him, too. Cold, distant. It felt like I was looking at a shadow of someone I knew.

“You couldn’t stay away, could you?” he said, his voice dripping with something dark, something that made my skin crawl.

“Ricardo, what’s going on?” I whispered. “Why are you doing this?”

he laughed, a low, bitter sound that echoed in my chest. “Ricardo? Is that what you think my name is?” he stepped closer, his smile widening. “You pathetic little girl. You actually thought this was real?”

The words hit me like a slap. “Stop it,” I said, my voice shaking. But he just kept going, cutting deeper, until I couldn’t take it anymore. I shoved him, and he stumbled back, hitting the coffee table. There was a loud crack, and then… silence.

I rushed over, panicking, but when I looked down, my heart stopped. It wasn’t Ricardo lying there. It was a mannequin, its glassy eyes staring up at me, limbs twisted in unnatural angles. Pinned to its chest were the flashcards I’d given him. “You make me feel safe.” “I love you.” “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”

I stumbled back, my hands shaking, but then I saw something else—something new. One of the cards had different handwriting, sharper, deliberate. “Smile. I’m watching you. Your loving Father.”

I felt sick, but then I noticed them—the tiny red lights, blinking in the corners of the room. Cameras, hidden all around. he’d been watching. My father had seen everything. Every desperate encounter, every time I’d begged to feel wanted.

I couldn’t stay there. I ran, drove straight to my fathers’s work, not even sure what I was going to say, just knowing I needed to confront him. When I barged into his office, he was sitting there, calm, as if he’d been waiting for me.

“Welcome, sweetheart,” he said, his voice eerily calm. “I was hoping you’d come.”

“What is this?” I demanded, my voice cracking. “What have you done?”

he smiled, leaning back in his chair. “This, my dear, is my research. A study in dependency, control, and the fragile female ego. And you… you were my perfect subject.”

I felt the ground crumble beneath me. “You… you did this? All of it?”

“Of course,” he said, his eyes cold. “Every word, every flashcard. I needed to see how far I could push you, how much you’d crave something I never gave you. And you didn’t disappoint.”

I could barely breathe. he hadn’t been my father. he’d been my tormentor, my manipulator, and I’d walked right into his trap.

“You’re sick,” I whispered, tears stinging my eyes. But he just tilted his head, like he was studying me.

“No, sweetheart,” he said, his voice soft, but without any warmth. “I’m just thorough.”
