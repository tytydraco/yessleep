I remember that day like it was yesterday. The sunlight slanted through the blinds, casting long, tired shadows across the floor. I was sitting by the window, looking out at the quiet street.

The sound of a car passing by broke the silence, but my mind was elsewhere. I had a lot on my mind that morning. Too much, in fact, and none of it made sense. The whole thing started like any other regular day.

I had just come back from the gym, feeling like I'd done something good for myself for the first time in a while. I still remember how the air felt that morning, crisp and cool.

Like it wanted to wash away the exhaustion from my life. For a moment I felt hopeful. Maybe things were turning around. But then my phone buzzed on the table.

It was Sasha. Sasha was the one person I could always count on.

We'd known each other for years. Longer than I could even remember. He was the guy who'd been there when things were good and, more importantly, when things were bad.

I always trusted his judgment, even when he said things I didn't want to hear. I swiped to answer, trying to shake off that uneasy feeling in my chest. Hey man, got a minute?

Sasha's voice was tight, like something was wrong. I sat up straighter, something in his tone made me stop. What's up? I asked, trying to sound normal, but I felt a knot forming in my stomach.

There was a pause on the other end, and then Sasha spoke, slower this time. Look, There's something you need to know, and I don't know how to say it, but you're going to hate me for it." I frowned, a sudden wave of unease washing over me.

What's going on? I asked trying to stay calm. I didn't want to admit it, but I could feel my heart racing in my chest. There was another pause. This one felt like it lasted forever.

Alex he he sold us out. He betrayed you. I felt like the air had been knocked out of my lungs. I froze for a moment, staring at the phone in disbelief. I didn't know how to respond.

My mind was a whirlwind of thoughts. Alex, my best friend. The guy I'd known since childhood. The one I'd laughed with, fought with, and shared everything with.

The one I trusted with my life. How could he have done that? I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, a mix of confusion and betrayal flooding me. This couldn't be true.

It had to be a mistake. What? What do you mean? I finally managed to say, my voice trembling. I don't know all the details yet, but I've heard enough. He turned us in, man. To the cops.

To the feds. Whoever is in charge of that mess. I don't know how he got involved, but he's the one who sold us out. And I swear to God, he knew exactly what he was doing.

The room felt smaller all of a sudden. like the walls were closing in on me. The sound of my own breathing seemed so loud in my ears, and I could hear my heart beating harder with every word Sasha spoke.

You need to hear this from me, because I don't want you to find out in some way that's worse. I know what it means for us.

Man, you're gonna want answers and you're gonna want them from him. You're gonna have to face him. I didn't say anything for a moment. What was there to say? Sasha was right. I had to see Alex.

I had to hear it from him. I wasn't sure I even wanted to believe it. But the more I thought about it, the more I could feel the ugly truth sinking in.

I didn't know how to process it, how to confront him, but I knew I had to do it. I ran my hand through my hair, feeling the weight of the situation settling in.

Sasha wasn't the type to make things up or exaggerate. If he said Alex had done something like that, it was true. I could already feel the tension in my chest.

The idea of facing Alex after all this, of hearing the truth from him, it felt like I was walking toward a cliff I wasn't sure I could climb back from.

But I had to know. I'll go to him, I said, my voice sounding smaller than I intended. I have to, Sasha sighed heavily. Be careful, man.

I don't know what's gonna happen, but you're gonna want to hear it from him. And don't do anything stupid. I hung up the phone, still holding it in my hand as I sat there, not knowing what to do next.

The room felt suffocating, and the coldness of it seemed to seep into my bones. I couldn't stop replaying Sasha's words in my head.

Alex, how could he? I spent the next few hours just sitting there, going over every memory of him, every conversation we'd had, trying to remember the times when things felt real.

But nothing made sense anymore. If he really had betrayed me, if he had sold us out, what did that mean for everything we'd built together? Eventually, I got up, grabbed my jacket, and headed out. I had no plan, no script for what I was about to do.

But there was only one thing I knew for sure. I needed to see Alex. I needed answers, no matter the cost. The streets outside felt like a different world.

The noise of passing cars, the distant chatter of people going about their lives. It all seemed so distant, so insignificant in comparison to what I was about to do.

My hands were clammy as I gripped the wheel. The engine's hum under my fingers almost drowned out by the pounding in my chest.

I couldn't stop thinking about Sasha's words. You're going to want to hear it from him. What was he going to say? Was he going to deny it?

Was he going to lie to my face? Or worse, was he going to admit it without remorse? I drove to Alex's place, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I couldn't focus on anything else. I barely remembered the route. It was like the whole world had narrowed down to one destination, his apartment.

When I parked outside, I sat there for a moment, my fingers still gripping the steering wheel as I stared at the building. Part of me wanted to just drive away, forget it all, but I knew I couldn't.

I had to confront him, no matter how hard it was, I needed to hear the truth from him. I took a deep breath, wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans, and got out of the car.

The elevator ride up to his floor felt like the longest few seconds of my life. Each floor passed, each moment felt like a countdown to something I couldn't control. My heart was thumping louder than ever. And with every chime of the elevator, I felt my nerves tighten further.

When the doors opened, I stepped out and walked down the hallway. His apartment was at the end, and I could already hear sounds coming from inside. I paused in front of the door. My throat was dry. I knocked, twice. It didn't take long for him to open it.

Alex said, his voice too casual, too normal. His eyes flickered to mine for a split second. Then he looked away, rubbing his hands on his jeans.

I couldn't tell if he was nervous, but I didn't trust him. Not anymore. Can we talk? I asked, the words almost sticking in my throat. My stomach was twisted in knots. He looked me over, hesitated. then stepped aside and let me in without saying a word.

His apartment looked the same as it always had, a little cluttered, not much. The smell of coffee hung in the air, and there was a faint trace of something that reminded me of old books. Nothing had changed, except everything had. I walked in and stopped just inside the door.

Alex stood behind the couch, his arms crossed, staring at me like he was trying to read me, like he was trying to figure out what was coming. I had a thousand questions, but the first one slipped out of my mouth without thinking. Did you do it?

My voice was tight, strained. He blinked like the question caught him off guard. Then he smirked, that old familiar smirk that always made me think he had some kind of joke up his sleeve.

Did I do what? His voice was so damn calm. Sell us out. I took a step forward, my eyes not leaving his. You turned us in, didn't you? To the cops?

To the feds? You did it, Alex. Don't lie to me. He leaned back against the couch, his gaze never leaving mine. There was no guilt in his eyes, no remorse.

Just cold, calculating indifference. Why would you think that? He said it like it was an absurd question, like he couldn't believe I'd even ask.

Because I know, man, I know what you did." The words tasted bitter, as if I were choking on them. Sasha told me, I don't know all the details, but I know you sold us out. I watched his face carefully, hoping to see some crack, some sign of guilt.

But there was nothing, just that same smile, the one that always made me feel like I was the punchline of some joke I couldn't quite understand. Come on!" he said with a sigh, pushing off from the couch and walking over to the kitchen. Sasha's paranoid. He's always been.

He's making a big deal out of nothing. I shook my head, feeling my heart drop. Stop lying. I heard the recording. Don't try to cover this up. You know what you did. He froze, just for a second. His back was turned to me, but I could see his shoulders stiffen.

Then, slowly, he turned around with that same nonchalant expression. He chuckled, though it didn't sound genuine. You think I'd do something that stupid? You really think I'd leave a trail for you to follow? You don't know me at all, man. I stepped closer.

You're not fooling anyone. You betrayed us, Alex, and now you're sitting here acting like everything's fine. You're lying to my face. For a moment there was silence, a long stretch of it. I felt the tension thickening in the room, like a storm waiting to break. Then Alex spoke again.

But this time, his tone was different. It was colder, more deliberate. You think I betrayed you, huh? He stepped toward me slowly, his eyes darkening with every word. Let me ask you something. How many times did we get away with things we shouldn't have?

How many times did we play the game, thinking we were untouchable? Did you think it would last forever? I stood frozen, his words slicing through the air like a blade. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what he was saying. I did what I had to do," he continued, his voice low now almost like a whisper. I played my part.

You can hate me all you want, but the fact is you were too naive to see it. This isn't a game anymore. It never was. And you, he pointed a finger at me. You didn't see the writing on the wall. You thought we were some kind of team, some kind of family.

Well, wake up, man. That's not how this world works. I stared at him, my thoughts crashing into one another. This wasn't the Alex I knew. The Alex I knew would have never said something like that, would never betray anyone in cold blood.

But here he was, standing in front of me, a stranger with the same face and the same words I couldn't believe. The words hung in the air, thick with something darker than just betrayal.

Alex was standing there, in front of me, like a complete stranger. There was no trace of the guy I grew up with, the guy who'd been my friend for as long as I could remember.

Now, it was like I was looking at a mirror reflecting a version of him that I couldn't recognize. His words, sharp, deliberate, had cut through everything I thought I knew. The room seemed to get smaller, the air heavier with every syllable. I had to blink a few times to process it all.

He was still staring at me, that cold look in his eyes, like he was daring me to believe him. But I couldn't. No matter how hard I tried to twist the situation in my mind, it wasn't adding up.

The Alex I knew would never, could never, sell out the people who were closest to him. You really think I'm the bad guy here? Alex's voice broke through my thoughts, low and steady.

I did what I had to do to survive. And you, you were too caught up in this fantasy of loyalty and trust. The world's not like that anymore, man. You should know that.

I took a step back, a jolt of disbelief shooting through me. The words stung more than I expected. I hadn't anticipated that he'd be so indifferent, so cold. I thought if I confronted him, if I stood my ground, maybe he'd admit it.

Maybe he'd break down and apologize, maybe he'd even try to justify it. But this... This wasn't what I expected. I can't believe you, I whispered, my voice thick with the bitter taste of hurt and anger. All these years, Alex, I trusted you.

We went through everything together. And now you're telling me it was all just a game to you. He shook his head. His lips curling into a small, almost amused smile.

You really don't get it, do you? He said, stepping closer. You're so wrapped up in your sense of brotherhood that you can't see the bigger picture.

You think I betrayed you? You think I'm the one who ruined this? No. You were the one who couldn't see it coming. I wanted to shout. I wanted to grab him by the shoulders and shake some sense into him. But my body was frozen in place, like my mind couldn't catch up with the speed of my emotions.

Anger. Hurt. Confusion. They all tangled together in a knot in my chest. For a second, the room felt suffocating. I wanted to say something. Anything that could change the direction of this conversation. I wanted to fight for the friendship we'd had. The trust we'd built over the years. But the words were stuck.

They felt useless. Why Alex? I finally managed. My voice horse. Why would you do this? After everything. He sighed, his gaze softening just for a second, almost as if he were genuinely contemplating my question. You're still not getting it. This whole thing, it was never about you. It was never about us.

It was about survival. And you know what? I'm done pretending. I felt a shiver crawl up my spine. The way he said it, it wasn't just a betrayal of me. It was a betrayal of everything we had ever built together.

It wasn't just about business or loyalty. It was about something deeper, something he'd been hiding for so long. I could feel the walls closing in again. Every word Alex spoke chipped away at everything I thought I knew. I wasn't just angry anymore. I was scared. Scared of what he'd become.

Scared of how easily he had turned on me. But mostly, I was scared of the person I was becoming by standing here, letting him speak this way. What happened to you, man? I muttered, mostly to myself. How did we end up here? Alex's expression shifted again, just slightly. But I saw it.

A flash of something. Maybe regret, maybe bitterness. Maybe a mix of both. But it was fleeting. Just a brief crack in his mask. You really think I had a choice? He asked, almost softly. His voice wasn't as confident now. You think I wanted this? I didn't. But when you're stuck in the middle of it all, you do what you have to do to get out.

And now I'm free. You, on the other hand, He trailed off, looking at me with something that almost seemed like pity. You're still stuck, still playing the game. I shook my head, trying to steady myself, but I was shaking now. Deep down, I could feel my hands trembling. I felt like I was suffocating.

This wasn't the Alex I knew. This wasn't the guy I thought I understood. He wasn't just a friend anymore, he was a stranger. A stranger I couldn't trust. A stranger who had taken everything from me. I turned and walked toward the door.

My mind spinning with thoughts I couldn't piece together. I was done. I needed to get out. I needed air. I needed space. Don't think you can just walk out of here like that. Alex called after me.

His voice low and almost amused, but I didn't stop. Couldn't. I didn't even turn around.

The door slammed shut behind me, and for a split second, I thought I might collapse right there in the hallway. My legs felt like they were made of stone.

My heart was a hammer in my chest, and my mind was still reeling from the conversation. I didn't know what to think anymore. I didn't know how to process any of this.

I didn't know how to live in a world where my best friend, someone I thought I could count on above all others, had just completely shattered everything I believed in. As I stepped into the elevator and the doors closed, I felt the weight of the situation settle into the pit of my stomach.

This wasn't over. Not yet. But I didn't know how I could ever look at him the same way again. The drive home was a blur. I couldn't focus on the road, couldn't hear the hum of the tires against the asphalt.

My hands gripped the wheels so tightly that my knuckles turned white. But even that wasn't enough to distract me from the chaos in my mind.

What just happened? I kept replaying the conversation in my head. over and over again. The things Alex said, the way he acted like everything we'd shared meant nothing. How he looked at me with those cold eyes, as if he'd never once cared about the years we'd spent side by side.

By the time I pulled into my driveway, I was exhausted. Not physically, but mentally. It felt like my brain was running a marathon and had no way of slowing down. I left the car door open as I stepped out
