I don't know what the hell just happened, I need someone to tell me, what do I do? To give you some context, it all started today, well, when I can't sleep, I start playing LoL. I was completely absorbed in the game when suddenly I received a blank message. When I picked up my phone and saw that it was blank, my phone completely shut down. There was no reason for that to happen since it was connected to the charger and had enough battery.  
  
Certainly, before it shut down, the message was from a strange number: +000 000-000-0000. The message was blank, as I said, with no content or sender. That made me feel a strange unease, as if my phone had been hacked, I thought. Well, I tried to turn it on again, and it didn't, so I got worried about my files.  
  
I looked at my turned-off phone and then at the door of my room, which was closed as usual. The room was in complete darkness, lit only by the computer screen. I don't get scared easily, but at that moment, a feeling of unease began to creep over me, so I decided to grab my cable and connect it to the computer to disinfect the phone. That's when something out of the ordinary began to happen. I heard an unmistakable sound: the splashing of water in a pool, a sound that, well, brings back good memories, and the characteristic smell of chlorine filled the air in my room, and I felt as if I were on the edge of a pool. My concern turned into curiosity. How was it possible that I could hear and smell a pool in my room? I tried to turn my phone on again to get some light, but the screen remained off, and none of the buttons responded. The light from the computer was the only thing that allowed me to see, and my mind began to think several things at once. I was honestly getting worried.  
  
The sounds of the pool became more intense, as if I were right next to a full pool. However, not hearing people was the weirdest part. I thought it might be my dad's leaky pipes, but it shouldn't sound so... watery? I tried to contact you guys to tell you what was happening, but apparently, my body didn't cooperate. My fingers trembled as I tried to write, and I had trouble concentrating because of how confused and upset I was. In the end, I couldn't write anything more than "-My phone shuts off, - 5 seconds later, my room's light."  
  
Finally, I decided to open the door of my room to find out where that noise and smell were coming from. However, what I found on the other side of the door left me completely baffled. I wasn't in my hallway or my house; I was in a completely different place, which, to my eyes, looked like backrooms. That's when I got scared, and I said, "No way, I must be dreaming, I just ate some melatonin gummies." But I think I wasn't dreaming; there were endless, yellowed hallways that seemed to have no end, with a feeling of abandonment and decay. And obviously, I had no idea how I had ended up there or how to get out of this strange place because, if I forgot to mention it, the door to my room was no longer there. So every step I took led me deeper into this maze of hallways, and disorientation began to overwhelm me. Every time I turned a corner, it seemed like I was back in the same place. The disorientation was overwhelming me, and the feeling that something that shouldn't be with me was becoming more and more present, and honestly, it wouldn't go away.  
  
As I continued down these endless hallways, I began to notice increasingly strange details. The lights were flickering irregularly, the buzzing and creaking of ventilation ducts were giving me a headache, and the feeling that I wasn't alone in these hallways was becoming stronger. Sometimes, I thought I heard distant whispers, other times, I perceived fleeting movements in the shadows, like silhouettes that disappeared quickly.  
  
My thoughts were getting darker as I tried to find a way out because I don't think this is a dream. I wonder if this is some kind of endless nightmare, or if I'm really in the backrooms. I try to remember how I got here, but the memories as I write this are becoming blurry, as if they're fading into the mist.  
  
The hours I've spent here seemed endless in this labyrinth of endless hallways. My mind was filled with fears and unanswered questions. How do I get back home? What is this place? Why did I end up here? I'm physically and mentally exhausted, but I know I can't give up if I want to survive. I have to find a way out.  
  
After what felt like an eternity, I see a door at the end of one of the hallways. I approached it cautiously and opened it, hoping to find some answers. Upon opening it, I was back in my room, but... something still doesn't feel right, as if it's not really my room. There's something, I don't know what it is, but it's out of place.  
  
If I can, I'll update you on what happened tomorrow.
