call the number on the back of your id card NOW

**EDIT:** and tell wendy i love her

**EDIT 2:** dude please make the call, I know your e-sports team was playing last night but to hell with your hangover WAKE UP and ESCALATE THIS

**EDIT 3:** I'm still alive which means that he's still sleeping or puking his worthless guts out I guess? I don't remember his username, so uh. 

Hi everyone else. Hope you're all having a better day at work than I am.

**EDIT 4:** I honestly couldn't tell you what the lab is called if I wanted to. And that's a good thing. That way, if Mort ever picks up his phone, and he sees this, and they send F-16s or whatever, I'll die but everyone else in the tri-state area will live. People won't swarm the area for Instagram pics and end up undermining my \~hErOiC sAcRiFiCe. So, you know, yay?

And it's my own fault, being here. I knew I was getting into this. They print the crisis incident phone number on our badges for a reason. This place is *not* for civilians, not when it's working and especially not when it's...like this. I don't know if anything like this has ever happened before, I guess. The top brass take the whole secrecy thing really seriously. If I hadn't left my phone at my desk - and if Mort wasn't so addicted to this stupid site that he specifically whitelisted it - our operational security would have been airtight. But I guess "airtight" isn't really our thing lately.

**EDIT 5:** "duhhhhh if you can access Reddit, why can't you get in touch with your bosses?" duhhhhh well first of all, I thought I had?? I hit the fire alarm-looking thing on the wall like they told us to, every single button in the whole hall on my way here. Except, if that had worked, I wouldn't have enough molecules left to type this. I guess someone disabled the alarm systems before their face started melting off? Or maybe the...the whatever it is melts cables too?

Not thinking about that. Not thinking about any of that now. 

Ok. I can't send an email (no two-factor authentication, without my phone or the access token-thingy on my keyring) and I can't call them (phone again). There's no desk phone here, and I don't really want to try the other offices, even if there might be phones there, because what good would that do? "But isn't the number on your badge?" Yeah, it sure is! Unfortunately, Josh, formerly of the Robotics Lab, pulled my badge off as he was trying to bite me. After I staked him to his desk with pens, I somehow didn't think to recover it. Silly me.

So I'm hiding in an office with the lights off and Mort's stupid mechanical keyboard unplugged because it's loud as hell and I don't want to draw the attention of my rapidly disintegrating coworkers. I'm not exactly in the greatest mental space to figure out alternatives.

I dunno. I'm not a network guy, I'm an analyst. It's a miracle I can even post. I don't know how Mort circumvented the restrictions on his own computer. I've tried to get on the internet with the other computers he has in his office, but this is the only one that can access anything, and it can only access Reddit. Every other website I've tried is blocked. I think the only reason I'm able to do that is because I'm using the guest account on his computer, and maybe it's based on the MAC address? That's my best guess, and I can't look up how MAC addresses work, so it's going to have to do.

DAMN IT MORT IT'S PAST NOON, HOW ARE YOU STILL ASLEEP

**EDIT 6:** I don't know why they're melting, you guys. A virus? A bacteria? I studied economics, they didn't cover this. There are people in this facility who keep an extra pair of shoes in their lockers because if there's a spill in their lab, they have to burn whatever they were wearing. I was only in the Robotics area for a minute, just to see if they had been getting power brownouts too, but I'm pretty sure they didn't cause...this?

They sure caught it, though. Josh was the only one still standing, when I got there, just watching as the robot dog things stumbled around, tripping on loops of meat that used to be on the inside of the other team members. I always figured that if anything in the lab was going to murder me, it would be those things. I guess there's still time for them to pull that out of the hat, but I wouldn't bet on them anymore.

I'm trying to get into Mort's account. I'm using names of League of Legends characters, because he's obsessed with that game and I literally have no idea what else to do with the rest of my life.

**EDIT 7:** lotta screaming. Sounds like a door down the hall broke. I've like, quadruple-checked that the ceiling is solid in this room. No luck with the passwords. Maybe he's not using his birthday as a part of it? It was only two weeks ago, which is almost lucky, inasmuch as I can feel lucky under the circumstances.

**EDIT 8:** WAIT GODDAMN IT DID HE USE L33T OR WHATEVER

**EDIT 9:** MORT YOU ARE THE WORST, "5UMM0N3R5!"?? REALLY???

**EDIT 10:** Ok. Ok. I sent an email to the report line, from his Outlook. So I guess that's. That's good? The automatic email reply said I should hear back within 10 minutes, which I guess is how long it takes to scramble a jet. So in the meantime I'm going to just...read his emails, I guess? Nothing else I can do.

**EDIT 11:** Huh. He actually did email our boss this morning, saying he was "still" too sick to come to work. Can't believe he's sick enough not to be on Reddit, reading this. That's gotta be a first. I thought for sure he was just playing hooky after staying up too late. Maybe he really was feeling sick yesterday afternoon.

Got a reply from the report line. They said not to worry about my family, that they'll take care of them, which is good, I guess. They said it'll all be over soon.

I'm just. I'm not going to think about it.

**EDIT:** IF YOU'RE READING THIS GET UNDERGROUND AND TAPE UP ANY WINDOWS, DO IT RIGHT NOW, DON'T TOUCH ANYONE

TELL THEM THAT IT'S NOT MORT EMAILING, HE'S STILL OUT THERE

I FOUND HIS REDDIT ACCOUNT, IT AUTOFILLS WHEN I OPEN THE PAGE, HE POSTED A PICTURE TO r/\[redacted\] ASKING ABOUT A SKIN CONDITION, AND HE LOOKS LIKE JOSH DID, HE'S GOT IT TOO, YOU'RE ALL IN--
