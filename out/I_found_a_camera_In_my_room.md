So I am a male, 14 sitting at my computer playing call of duty with my friends when my mom told me to get dressed for the wedding we went to. When we arrived I saw a strange man dressed In all classic black. Though I Ignored It I also saw him inside the wedding place,

and then it’s like he just disappeared. Once we were on our way home In the car we saw that same man on the side of the road. Once we reached home I went up to my room and went to play some more call of duty. Then my mom asked me to clean up my “messy” room, once It was turn for me to clean up the dresser I started with cleaning from the bottom up. Once I came to the top I saw the horrifying thing. A little black red flashing camera. I looked at the back and found a flash drive connected to It with the following text on it “open me.”

So I put it in my laptop and went onto the drive and what I saw was absolutely gruesome. I saw multiple pictures of people my age ripped up in the same basement. That’s when I got a text from a unknown number saying “you’re next”. Once I showed my parents it they just thought I was playing trick on them. I now live in constant fear of getting kidnapped, been thinking of calling the police but I’m scared they won’t believe me. I hear something outside my window let me go check It, false alarm. It was just a tree branch bashing on my window. I’m gonna go make some food now…. 

HE IS MINE I HAVE HIM AMONGST ALL THE OTHERS. And you are next SAY GOODBYE TO YOU’RE FAMILY YOU HAVE THREE DAYS UNTIL I WILL STRIKE YOU ALL AND I WILL RIP YOU UP AND FEED YOU TO THE OTHERS LIKE I DID WITH YOU’RE LITTLE WEDDING WRITER HERE. SOON YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A CAMERA SOMEWHERE IN YOU’RE ROOM. JUST WAIT IT WILL HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER SO YOU BETTER WATCH OUT. THERE IS A WAY YOU CAN ESCAPE THIS. STAY IN SIDE LOCK YOUR DOORS AND DO.NOT.STEP.OUTSIDE NEVER EVER TO THAT….

I am back. I know it’s here. I can see it from the corner of my eye, it’s staring deep into me from the right corner in my ceiling. I can’t move a muscle. I am forced to my chair, almost feels like I’m glued to it. I know it’s gonna kill me. I can hear the whispers in my head, It’s telling me to come closer. I feel like I’m being pulled out from my room down to my basement. I just realized, It was my basement with all of the people In, and those people trying to kill me has been my parents all along, that’s why I was never allowed into the basement as a kid. And the classic black dresses man was trying to warn me. Goodbye you guys
