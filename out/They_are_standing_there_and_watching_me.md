  

I don’t know what is going to happen next so I have decided to write it down fast and post it here so at least someone would know. I am sitting in my flat being afraid to look out of the window. 

&#x200B;

It started five months ago. I was coming back home quite late when I noticed that someone is following me. It was after midnight, streets were quite empty. While I was still on the big street I have decided not to turn right, on the small dark street that lead to my house. Luckely, there was a woman waiting for the traffic light to let her go and I joined her. The person kept going in the direction of my flat. 

After a while I reassured myself that it was just my imagination and decided to go home. I passed through this small street and was already on my street, three minutes from my house, when I have realized that the person came back and kept following me. I have stopped right under the streetlight, trying to call my boyfriend. As it was already middle of November it was quite cold outside, the phone didn’t work properly. The person approached me.

I was already scared. Trying to come up with an idea what I should do. Now I could see him. The tall athletic guy, looking nothing but the average local person in his late 20-s. I still had drops of hope. 

\-Are you going home? – he asked with a soft smile. 

\-Yes, I do. 

\-I know this is your house, - he pointed right at the entrance door of my block of flats, - Let’s go, I will go with you. 

The fear grabbed me. I lived in the block of flats, where only third of apartments was actually inhabited and my neighbours worked night shifts. I lived on the top floor. It was obviously dangerous to go there. I decided to stay outside as long as possible. 

\-No, sorry, I am waiting for my father, he is on the way to pick me up. – I tried to say something to win the time. 

\-Father… All of you always say like that. Do you know why I was following you? -he asked. The blood in my veins froze. 

\-No. Please go away you are scaring me, - I felt how hysteria slowly capturing me. 

\-I was following you because I couldn't help it. I will do it anyway; we will do it anyway. You cannot escape.

At this moment I have realized that I am fucked. I started to move back, but he tried to stop me. First he tried to take of my phone, after it keep my by my scarf and unbutton my coat. Luckily, I have managed to run away. The police office nearby was closed to I was already desperately crying when I have seen a couple. I asked them to walk me home. Those night I couldn’t sleep. 

&#x200B;

The next day I have decided go to the police and report the case. Of course, they didn’t want to file the report, because I didn’t know the guy and there were any evidences of attack. But finally I mad the police officer to write down everything that has happened to me. When I was describing the perpetrator I have remembered strange tattoo that I have seen in the street light on his neck. It was on the right side of the neck, very thin curved line. It could be a snake, but I couldn’t see neither head nor tail. 

I was standing outside of the police office smoking while the same police officer came outside. I didn’t have my glasses with me, but he also had something on his neck. I was sure I am going mad and decided to go home to rest. 

In the next two months I was called to come to the police office several times. The whole process was quite exhausting, and I already regret I reported it. There was not any progress in the case anyway. After another interview with the police, I stopped by the supermarket. I was standing and choosing snacks, when I have realised that there was a total silence in the building. I looked around. Everyone was standing still watching me. I slowly started mowing to the checkout. Everyone was following me with their eyes. The cashier didn’t talk to me, just looked straight in the eyes. And this is when I have noticed it. The lady turned left for a moment and I have recognized the same tattoo on her neck. Only this one was a bit thicker. 

It literally freaked me out and I ran out from the shop. If before I was reassuring myself that I was still in shock when I have seen policeman’s neck, now there were no any excuses. I moved in to this district of the city two months before the attack has happened, is it possible I do not know something? From this moment I started to search. I went to the city archives, but it was unsuccessful. I tried to meet with local historian, who wasn’t in the city for more than a year so I couldn’t reach him. 

Meanwhile I started to pay attention to the people that I see around me. Old lady walking her dog, bartender in nearest pub, postwoman – I saw these tattoos more often. My assumption was probably it was kind of local community or something like this, and that is why they do not want to investigate what happened to me. They were trying to protect the guy, what actually pissed me off. Since than I have bought a pepper spray and didn’t come back home late or at least not alone. In a while I let it go and tried not to think about it, even though sometimes to see this tattoo again was quite disturbing for me. 

&#x200B;

Once I was sitting in the café studying. A lady approached me and gave me the book. 

\-I am so sorry, do not understand me wrong. My name is Lea, I am working in the archive. I have seen you there some time ago. You looked worried. I couldn’t stand checking your requests in the archive. I think, I found what you need. I can’t tell you more, I am sorry. – said the lady and left. 

First, I was quite irritated by the fact that I was watched. I was more irritated by the fact that person confessed. But in a second, I have seen the book she gave me. The book was very old, and its cover was almost totally damaged. In the book I found a map of the approximate territories of our city. In the map there was a bog forest that surrounded land of my district. Now we do not have even tenth part of the trees. 

After several days of my attempts to identify what was written in these old pages the whole picture started to be clear. I was right about the community. But according to the book, it was quite old association that was established first to protect. I couldn’t understand to protect what or whom, but what I have got that they have rich culture with various rituals and tradition. 

Out of sudden strange things started to happen in my place. Once I have noticed cigarette butt in my ashtray. Butt of kind of cigarettes that I do not know. Also during the night, I started to hear strange sounds in my flat. I usually sleep with closed door to my bedroom. Sounds felt like someone in my apartment. The sound of footsteps, like someone put something on the table, falling things. 

My house is pretty old, so you never can say whether sounds are coming from the neighbours. Sometimes even started to hear whispering and quite voices. After a while I became very scared, my anxiety started to be too annoying and disturbing my daily routine. I didn’t sleep almost at all and was easy to be triggered. I decided to stop it. 

One evening when I was going to sleep I took my pepper spray and kitchen knife with me. I closed the door to my bedroom inside. I have decided to check if someone is in the flat of I hear the noise tonight. And I did. 

I woke up in the middle of the night again, hearing strange noises that were coming from the kitchen. The door from my bedroom is leading right to the kitchen. I slowly moved to the door. The light outside of the bedroom was off. But the voices more and more sounded like they were coming right from my kitchen. They were more whispers than voices. I decided to look at the keyhole. 

There was a window right next to the door so part of the corridor was partly lightened by the moonlight. Suddenly something long and black moved across the room. I have realized than my worst fears were true. I was not alone. 

I tried to call the police, but no one picked up. I was calling directly to the police office in our district, that was probably a mistake. I was so scared that it gave me the courage. I rook the pepper spray and the knife and decided to open the door. 

There was no one in my kitchen. I decided to check out the staircase. We have move detectors that turn on the light if there is someone moving in the space. I opened the keyhole and for a moment saw the same black thing. It was ruching downstairs. Now I could see it better. It was a black cloak with sharp standing hood. It was moving so smooth as if it didn’t have legs but levitated. 

I was freaked out. 

I ran to the window and looked out of it. I will never forget what I have seen. They were standing there watching me. Many of them. There were people standing outside of my house, watching right at my window. All of them wore the same cloaks. The looked just like black entities who looked right through me.

I immediately called my friend. I was afraid to look outside of the window so I do not know what happened to the people next, but when she came they were already gone. We packed fast and left. I moved to her place for a month. I worked a lot with my psychiatrist to live it through. And after a whole both of us agreed that I had awful level of anxiety and it could be just my nerves that were playing a bad game with me. I decided to come back home. At least for one night. 

&#x200B;

This morning I came back home. I locked myself in the bedroom, took knife and pepper spray. I already was quite sure that all of it was my imagination after reading the book and I just must be calm. I fall asleep quite fast. 

I have heard a noise. I opened my eyes. And I have seen them. 

They were standing around my bed in the circle watching me. The same black cloaks and total silence around. I closed my eyes and screamed. 

I don’t know for how long I was screaming, but after some time I switched on the light. There was no one in the room. Aggressively I took pepper spray and ran out of the bedroom. The door from the bedroom was opened. The door from the apartment is open wide, the light in staircase is on. 

I rushed to close the door. After quick investigation of the flat I was sure I was alone inside. But when I looked outside of the window, I saw them again. As last time they were standing downstairs and watching me. I am living on the 5th floor, but they definitely watched right at me.

I was trying to call my friends, neighbours, police. Nobody picked up. I decided to post it here. I am sitting in my apartment, while these people are starring at my window. I am afraid. I am just freaked out. If anyone knows anything about this cult, please tell me. I do now know what to do anymore.
