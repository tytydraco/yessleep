Two hundred dollar rent was unheard of in our city.  I jumped on the ad immediately and called the number.  Barely hanging on flipping burgers and bagging fries, I needed a dirt cheap place to live.  Elijah answered and provided the details, a two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of the luxurious harborside apartments.  150^(th) floor to be precise.  Unreal.  I thought I was dreaming.  Oceanside and city views.  Six thousand dollars a month but my share for one room was only going to be two hundred dollars.

“What’s the catch?  Why don’t you want to split the cost?” I asked.

“I’m a man of God.  And I want to do some good in this world, show God that I’m capable of entering those gates up above.”

So, I had a religious devotee to live with.  What’s the worst that could happen, I thought to myself.  I moved in within a day of our phone call.  Elijah—tall and slender—with glasses that made him appear way older than the fifty-three he told me he was, welcomed me into our apartment.

His widening smile caught me off guard when he saw the state I was in.  Scraggly beard and no shower for over a week.  I’d been living in my car for the past four months.  Only one duffel bag of clothes to my name. 

“Lord, welcome Anthony into our home.  I will ensure he is properly fed and taken care of,” Elijah said, looking to the ceiling.

“Hey man, I really appreciate you hooking it up with the deal to stay here.  It’s really generous of you.”

“Please sit.  You must be famished.  I’ve got quite the feast for you.”  Elijah led me to the dining room table and placed me into the chair.

Elijah served dish after dish of the most delicious, mouth-watering food I’d tasted in years, decades even.  It was pure bliss.  But there was something disturbing about his fascination with his faith.  He kept looking up to the ceiling every few seconds to converse, as if he was having a real conversation with God.

During that first week I lived there, I was pampered left and right.  Elijah made my bed each morning, did all the laundry, even helped me shave my beard and cut my hair.  I was truly flabbergasted at his generosity.  But it was around two am one evening when things took a strange turn.

I woke up to the sounds of Elijah talking in the living room, pleading, begging.  His voice grew louder to the point of shouting.  I quietly opened my bedroom door and poked my head out.  It was dark but Elijah was just visible enough.  He was completely naked head to toe, looking up at the ceiling.

“God, I am all yours.  Welcome me to those gates.  I am ready to ascend.  Show me a miracle.  Show me that my faith is not just a fabrication.  I am all yours.”

Elijah must have felt my presence.  He craned his neck to the right and locked eyes with me.  “I have gone above and beyond to care for Anthony.  Bring me to your gates.  Let him witness you.”

The apartment began to rumble.  I thought it was an earthquake at first until the cracks in the ceiling grew larger and larger, and the ceiling tore apart as a gigantic hand reached down and scooped up Elijah.

The fingers of the hand wrapped around Elijah’s tiny body and the hand squeezed its fist, squishing Elijah in the process.  Pools of blood painted the room, as the hand retreated back up to the sky.

I kept my mouth shut when the authorities questioned Elijah’s disappearance.  They couldn’t figure it out.  I’m living in my car again.  It’s probably the safer thing to do.
