I woke up this morning with a raging headache. I was out late last night celebrating landing a big account at work, and afterward I’d come straight home and crashed, barely even keeping my eyes open long enough to make it inside my apartment. I took an aspirin, showered, and dressed, watching a YouTube clip from yesterday about the explosion at T Coronae Borealis. Amazing how the explosion of a white dwarf 3,000 light years away could get so much attention here and now. But I guess “new stars” don’t come along every day - more like every eighty years, according to the experts. 

I left my apartment and saw Ms. Simmons standing in the hallway. *Great.* I usually avoided her; she was a retiree who didn’t have much to do since her kids moved away and always wanted to gossip about the neighbors. Gossip wasn’t really my thing, but she was so lonely that she was hard to say ‘no’ to, so I often ended up trapped listening to her go on about who said what or who went where or who wronged whom. But today, she just looked at me with a weird smile, light glinting off her eyes. Too relieved to look a gift horse in the mouth, I briefly greeted her and jogged to the stairs, thankful for the reprieve. 

I left my building and walked to the subway station. Without paying much attention to anyone around me, I swiped my pass and boarded the train. As I sat in the car, something seemed different than usual. It took a second, but then I realized what it was. The noise I was used to - people chattering on their phones, playing videos, speaking rudely to each other - was gone. It was completely silent. I looked up and realized why - no one on the entire train was talking. Instead, they were all staring. 

At me. 

And they all had the same look on their faces - a warped, disturbed smile, like they were seeing something that wasn’t part of this world. 

Freaked out, I hurried off the train, wanting to get away as quickly as possible. But as I walked down the street, I noticed more and more people looking at me the same way. And some of their eyes shone with an unnatural light. I started running, bursting through the door of my office. I’d made it. 

“Hey, Matt. What’s going on? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I looked up and saw Jim, one of my best friends. We’d met here five years ago when we’d both been interns, and we’d been fast friends ever since. If there was anyone I could talk to, it was him. 

“Man, you wouldn’t believe the morning I’ve had! Have you noticed anything weird today?”

“Weird like what?” 

“Just… people acting strange, not like themselves.”

Jim rubbed his chin in contemplation. “Well, Jenny at the coffee shop put a little heart over the i in my name on my coffee this morning. Does that count as weird?”

I sighed in relief. If he hadn’t seen anything, then everything was probably fine. 

“No, I think that just means she has a thing for you. You should ask for her number.”

“What?” he responded in surprise. “No way, man. You’re crazy.”

Ok, man,” I replied. “If you say so. But when the new year comes and you’re still single, don’t say I didn’t try to help.”

Relaxing, I went into the kitchenette to make my morning coffee (I didn’t share Jim’s morning Starbucks habit - I’d rather save the money and retire someday). Afterward I returned to my desk and started working. 

Around lunchtime, Jim came over and sat on the corner of my desk like he always did when he wanted to shoot the breeze. 

“So…?”

“Yes?”

“What you said about Jenny this morning. Were you just kidding, or..”

Good Lord. “Dude, if you *really* don’t see it, you’re too blind to do this job. ASK. HER. OUT.”

He looked toward the ground, clearly nervous and unsure of how to go forward. I was about to give him some tips when I realized something. 

The office had gone silent.

I don’t mean “everyone is focused on their work” silent. I mean “someone cut off the volume on the tv” silent. I looked up, and my coworkers were looking our way.

And they were smiling.

Without looking at him, I said “Jim, we need to get out of here. Now.”

“Relax, man. We can head out to lunch in a few. I just need to get this last report in for Williamson.”

“No,” I said, starting to worry. They were coming closer. “We need to get out of here. RIGHT. FUCKING. NOW. There’s no time to explain - I need you to trust me on this.”

He looked like he wanted to ask a question, but I guess the look of sheer panic on my face persuaded him. 

“OK, man. Whatever you say.”

“Great,” I said, standing up and heading for the door. “This way.”

I began to walk slowly and calmly toward the door, hoping not to push them into any sudden action. Jim followed along, matching my pace. But I could see some of them moving toward the door, and I knew that soon they’d cut us off and we’d have no way out. 

With no time to think, I acted on instinct. I ran for the door. Although confused, Jim ran to keep up with me, but was looking at me with confusion. 

“Why are we runni—”

“No time! Just trust me - we have to go!”

He seemed a bit skeptical, but he kept running. Unfortunately, our coworkers started running, too, and there were more of them. I made it through the door just in time with Jim right behind me. 

We ran out onto the street, but there was a mob of smiling figures. They turned toward us as soon as we stepped out, as if some sixth sense had alerted them to our presence. As one, they raised their arms and moved toward us. 

“What the hell is happening?” Jim asked, confused and panicking. 

“Keep running!” I scream-whispered back. 

We rounded a corner and ducked into an alleyway. We had lost them. I looked at Jim - he was a combination of scared shitless and completely befuddled. 

“What the hell was that?” he whispered. 

“That’s what I was freaked out about when I got to work this morning.  All day, I’ve been seeing people with that freaky smile chasing after me. And I could swear that some of their eyes were glowing. I don’t know what it means. But I know I can’t let them catch me.”

“Do we know what’s wrong with them?”

“No idea,” I replied. “I’m really not anxious to go up to one and ask.”

He nodded at that and leaned back, thinking silently. But the silence didn’t last. We heard another person running down the street away from them. He tried to cross the street and jump the fence, but the crowd caught him. I thought about going to help him, but there were at least thirty of them. What could I do?

Before I knew it, the crowd was laying him down on the ground. They held down his arms and legs so he couldn’t move, and then one of them held his head, forcing him to face upward, while another pried his eyes open. 

I’ll never forget his screams.

After a few minutes, he stopped screaming. Then the crowd backed away and he stood up. He was the same as before, but not. He looked calm, sure of himself. And on his face was the same smile as the others, the smile that said he knew everything and had no cares in the world. 

I looked behind me and Jim wore a look of abject terror. 

“What…?  What?”

“That’s what I was trying to ask you about this morning. When I asked if you’d seen anyone acting strange? People are walking around like zombies with these weird smiles on their faces. Some of them chased me this morning before I got to the office.”

“But what would have caused any of this?” 

“I’m not sure. The news was talking about some weird explosion in space that was visible from here last night - I think this was one of the only places it could be seen clearly. I don’t know, that sounds crazy to me, but I can’t think of anything else. Can you?”

Jim was silent. 

“And now that I think about it, I think whatever it is got my neighbor, too. She was acting weird this morning.”

I could see him trying to absorb these new developments. He took several deep breaths to get a hold of himself. 

“OK, say I believe… any of this. What do we do?”

“Well,” I said, thinking it through. “We can either get some weapons and go on the attack, find a place to hole up and hope it blows over, or find a car and get out of dodge.”

“Do we have any weapons?” Jim asked. 

“No,” I replied. “And there are way more of them than there are of us.”

“Do we have a car?”

“Not that I can get to without going back through them. I don’t think that’s such a good idea.”

“Do we know if it’s actually going to blow over?”

“I really hope so, but we don’t know anything for certain.” I replied. 

“Then I vote for option 2,” he said with determination.

With that, we started looking for a place to hide out. We moved quickly and quietly, trying not to draw their attention. We dismissed several places - too many points of entry, doors or windows we couldn’t secure, etc. At one point, we hopped over a fence and Jim landed flat on his back. I was worried, but after a couple of minutes he got up and we kept moving. Eventually we got lucky and found an abandoned automotive shop that looked like it went out of business with a lot of the inventory still here. We locked the doors and windows, found the best vantage point to make sure no one snuck up on us, and holed up for the duration. 

Later that night, I woke up to a strange sound. I didn’t know what it was, but then I looked over. Jim was standing up facing in my direction, and in the moonlight I could just make out his face. 

He was smiling. 

*Crap.*

“Jim, man, are you ok?”

He didn’t say anything, just started creeping toward me. 

*Double crap.*

“Jim, listen to me. Whatever is going on, I really need you to fight it, ok buddy? You’re still you.”

Nothing. 

“Were friends, right? Remember when we met as interns? When we both were completely overwhelmed after that first intern meeting and went out that night and got drunk together?”

He said nothing, but the creepy smile remained. 

It had definitely gotten him. But when? We’d been together all da— Oh. When he’d tripped before, he’d landed on his back. Facing the sky. *Dammit.*

I looked around the room, looking for anything I could use as a weapon to defend myself. 

Nothing. 

He was getting closer. I tried talking to him again. 

“Jim, stay back. If you keep coming, this is going to go badly.”

If anything, the smile widened. He kept coming. 

I looked around. The exit was about five yards past him - if I could get to it, I could make a break for it and probably outrun him. I didn’t know who else was out there, but at this point I’d take my chances. 

I ran toward him and made a last-minute move to go around him, but as I was almost past I felt a pain in my stomach and hit the ground. I was laying on the ground, dazed but knowing I needed to get up. And then I felt hands encircle my neck and squeeze. 

I tried to fight him off, but he seemed to have an unnatural strength and I couldn’t break his grip. His eyes began to take in a strange glow, and then he stopped squeezing, grabbed me by my legs, and started dragging me. 

Towards the door to the outside. Towards the sky. 

I knew if he got me out there, I’d be done for. Looking for any chance, I saw a forgotten wrench laying on the ground. If I could only reach it…

My fingers dragged across it and I lifted it and hit the thing-that-used-to-be-Jim in the back as hard as I could. 

He didn’t even flinch. 

What the hell *was* he?

He kept moving, so I hit him again, this time in the arms. His grip loosened and I pulled free. 

I stood to face him. He looked back at me, completely calm. The man I knew was gone - this thing looked at me with an unnatural expression on his face. Manic. Demented. Evil. 

Suddenly he jumped at me. I couldn’t believe how fast he moved. But I was ready. I waited until he was almost at me and then slid to the side and swung at his head as hard as I could. 

There was a crunch and he went down. Taking no chances, I swung again. And again. 

Finally, he stopped moving. I looked down and saw his face pointed up at me. 

The sight of his eyes faintly glowing, face twisted into a macabre grin as blood dripped down his skull, will stay with me until the day I die. 

Afterward, I knew I couldn’t stay there. I don’t know when more would be coming, I didn’t have supplies, and I wasn’t willing to stay with the body. I sat there, gathering my strength, and went outside after dark. After a mile, I lucked on an abandoned truck with the keys still in it. I drove as far as I could, stopping for gas and food when it seemed clear, and ended up in a small town on the other side of the country. People here are quiet, they keep to themselves, and they don’t look at the sky. 

Since I got here, I’ve been looking on the internet, and I don’t see any reports of anything like this happening elsewhere. I don’t even see any info on it happening in my town. I’ve written everything down so I know it was real. I don’t understand how this happened. I don’t know why it only happened in my old town - there was nothing special about it, it was just like any other. And I don’t know if it’s over. 

But I know three things. I’ll never look at the sky the same way again. If you’re smart, neither will you. 

And if you hear of something strange in the heavens, or if the people you thought you knew start acting strangely…

*RUN.*
