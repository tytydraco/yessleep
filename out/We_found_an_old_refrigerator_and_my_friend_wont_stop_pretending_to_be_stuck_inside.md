A couple days ago my friend Zazz tells us about this dumping ground in the woods and asks if we want to see it. It’s summer and we got nothing better to do so we all troop out there: me, my friend Zazz, my cousin Aiden who wants to salvage old junk to sell online, my older sister Lisbeth and my little sis Kisha who tags along cause Mom told Lisbeth to watch her.

The dump is exactly like you’d expect: broken washing machines and a sink and tarp and old wooden boards and oil drums and trash and no, none of it looks like you can sell it on ebay, Aiden. Good luck hauling that 6000lb rusted washing machine out of the woods yourself (I dunno how much stuff weighs, I’m bad at math). But we all go crawling around anyway, picking through old tires and flattened boxes and twisted shards of metal so rusted we’re all gonna need tennis shots (or whatever they’re called) and shattered glass and a grungy rolled up carpet and rank microwaves that Aiden insists we can “totally make bank on” if we scrape off a zillion layers of crusted gunk. None of it is cool or interesting, and I’m starting to think Zazz was an idiot for dragging us out here. But then—

At the bottom of the heap sits this old refrigerator.

This thing is like *medieval*. Like it could be Ben Franklin’s refrigerator. Almost more submarine than fridge, its dented sides and rusted metal handle could probably survive a bomb blast.

“Duuuuude,” says Zazz, “y’all know what’s probably in this fridge, right?”

“Your lunch?” jokes Aiden.

“A dead body,” I say.

Zazz points at me, like I just won the lottery, but instead of a million bucks I get whatever’s in that fridge.

Suddenly I know this is the *real* reason he’s led us all out here. Zazz is only ever interested in one thing: *scaring the bejeezus* out of us. Mom used to make us stay away from him cause he’s older than us and wears a trenchcoat and steel-toed boots and eyeliner but eventually she figured out he’s just goth. We hang out cause our houses are right across the street, also cause he has a crush on Lisbeth (my sis), which he shows by terrifying her. Not the most effective tactic but he’s pretty dumb that way. So when he hovers around the fridge like a moth around a zapper I know it’s gonna be key to his quest to win Lisbeth’s heart through jumpscares. (Good luck Romeo.)

And now he spreads his arms like the junk’s a stage and we’re all on the slope like the audience in seats made of dead appliances, and he starts telling us about refrigerators. Specifically, how likely we are to find a body in one.

Actually there’s a pretty good chance.

See, these old fridges were built back when they knew how to make stuff *last.* Sometimes kids would stumble across them years after they’d been dumped. And if you were a kid unlucky enough to crawl into an old fridge like this during hide and seek, it wouldn’t open from the inside. No, these old fridges have latching doors, so you’d be locked into an airtight sealed box, your screams muffled by its insulated steel until you suffocated. And no one would know the fridge was actually your coffin until they saw it in the dump and decided to check inside and then—woof, the almighty stink!

“So!” Zazz knocks on the dented white door. “Who’s going to open it?”

Nobody makes a move.

“Go on, Aiden.” I nudge him. “Maybe there’s something you can sell on ebay.”

“No fucking way,” Aiden says. “*You* do it!”

“*I’ll* do it!” announces my baby sis Kisha, who’s prolly the same age as whatever kid’s turning to jelly in there.

Lisbeth grabs her. “You’re not going anywhere *near*!”

“Guess *I’ll* have to open it then,” says Zazz, flashing a grin and gripping the rusted metal handle. He’s trying to be brave and sexy, and sneaks a glance at Lisbeth to see if she is impressed.

LOL nope.

Zazz’s shoulders slump as Lisbeth drags Kisha off to look at something less morbid. Aiden and I wait cause we wanna see what’s inside, but now Zazz lets go of the handle and gets this *look*, and Aiden and I make eye contact cause we just *know* he’s gonna, like, up the auntie or whatever in a feudal attempt to win her over (sorry if I spell stuff wrong). And sure enough, a few minutes later I see Zazz in his black trenchcoat luring Kisha into the woods while Lisbeth is distracted by Aiden (his usual wingman). Finally Lisbeth notices Kisha missing and starts freaking out. “Kisha? Kisha! KISHA!” She hollers in a high, panicky voice, “You’d better not be in the fridge!” And cause Lisbeth is actually a pretty good older sis she doesn’t even hesitate, just rushes over and grabs the rusted metal handle. It must weigh a *ton*, and she grunts as she hauls it open—

A long arm grabs her, and she *shrieks*—*AAAIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!*

Even at a distance, her voice rings our ears. I run down and see Zazz has pulled her on top of him. She’s so mad she’s hitting him pretty hard while he’s busting a gut. She tells him that it’s NOT funny and climbs out and shoves him down and storms off red-faced.

He’s teary-eyed with laughter.

What an idiot.

“Can I come out now?” yells Kisha from the woods.

I go up to join her and she asks why Zazz likes scaring our sister, and I tell her it’s his love language. She thinks real hard about this and says, “Maybe he should, like, try flowers instead.” LOL.

\*\*\*

We’re almost home when my phone starts buzzing.

**Zazz:** HELP!!!

**Zazz:** HELP!!!

**Zazz:** IN THE FRIDGE!!!

**Me:** nice try

**Zazz:** IM SERIOUSLY STUCK!!!

**Me:** rip

**Zazz:** NOT FUCKING KIDDING

**Zazz:** HELP!!!

I don’t wanna fall for the same trick as Lisbeth, so I ask her what I should do, but she tells me to “let him suffocate.” Aiden is on the path further behind us taking his sweet time so I wait for him to catch up then ask him where Zazz is. He looks surprised. “Thought he was with you?” Something about the way he says this makes me suspect he’s in on it. Especially when he refuses to come check with me cause it’s “gonna rain” and he might “catch cold.” Cool bro. You gonna say that at the funeral too?

But like on the .0000001% chance my friend needs *actual* help to save him from a Darwin award, I head back. And it’s weird, how everything seems normal when you’re with a group but when you’re by yourself suddenly it all gets, like, creepy and stuff. Heavy clouds hang low in the sky and a few fat droplets hit me. At the dump site, the bottom of the slope is in almost total dark because the sun is setting. The hairs on my arms and legs prickle like a zillion bugs crawling up my skin as I call, “Zazz?”

No response.

I crawl down and spot that dented white submarine of a refrigerator, lying at the very bottom. Its curving door is stained and scuffed but somehow timeless, like you could nuke it and it would totally be fine. The OG of dumped junk, it’s got this vibe like it’s so old it was the first thing here and the forest and this whole pile all grew up around it. I wonder if Zazz is really in there… wouldn’t his muscles be cramping? I imagine him all folded up inside like a spider waiting to uncurl a limb and drag me in.

I’ll admit it. I’m scared as shit—

*BZZZZZZZZZZZZT*

I jump and check my phone.

**Zazz:** HELP!!!!

“Zazz?” I shout.

No response. Is it so insulated in there that he can’t hear me? I pick my way down the slope.

A few feet away from the fridge, I pause.

*BZZZZZZZZZZZZT*

“Ok, ok, I’m coming!” I skid down the rest of the way until I’m close enough to touch the smooth white surface and say, “Hey, maybe you should try flowers instead so Lisbeth doesn’t hate you.” I’m hoping to rile him into responding, but not a peep—not a sound—nothing, even when I bang on the fridge. And then—I bark out a laugh, all the air busting out of me. “Dude! I can see your fingers holding the door open!” I watch as he adjusts his grip. He’s *really* determined to wait me out. Kudos to him for having the self control not to break even when called out. But like, I’m *not* gonna touch that fridge handle, not when it would put me in such easy range of those gripping fingers.

“Nope,” I decide.

And when my phone starts buzzing again as I climb away from the dump site, this time I ignore it.

\*\*\*

In the middle of the night, my phone won’t stop buzzing:

**Zazz:** COLD. COLD

**Me:** come on stop

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** STUCK

On and on. And like, *obviously* he’s not stuck, cause by now he’d have suffocated so how would he be texting? But even though I know that every vibration of my phone means he’s alive and well and giggling to himself from the safety of his room as he types and *definitely not stuck in that fridge*, it’s starting to super freak me out. I finally turn my phone on silent, but when I check again, he’s still texting. The next day my stomach knots with dread all through breakfast while my phone buzzes. I kinda wanna check the fridge, but it hasn’t stopped raining since yesterday and mom won’t let me go out while it’s wet. The weird thing is there’s nothing on his Youtube or Snapchat or Discord or *anywhere* just those dumb texts saying he’s COLD.

Finally I message him back:

**Zazz:** COLD

**Me:** maybe come out of the fridge then

**Zazz:** STUCK

**Zazz:** HELP!!!

**Me:** Fine I’ll come soon if you STOP MESAGING ME

The messages stop for awhile but once the sun starts sinking lower in the sky he messages again.

**Zazz:** R U COMING? COLD

**Me:** omfg

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** COLD

I’m starting to type a reply when a knock on my door makes me think maybe he’s finally gonna be standing there with his shit-eating grin—but no, it’s Lisbeth looking like she slept even worse than me. She says Zazz’s mom called asking if anyone’s seen him. And as soon as she says that, the knot of dread in my stomach becomes a noose around my throat so tight I can’t breathe. I tap quickly into my phone:

**Me:** Hey!!! Your mom’s super worried!!!

**Zazz:** STUCK

**Me:** I’m serious!!! Where are you rn

**Zazz:** FRIDGE

**Me:** bro everyone’s worried fr can you pls stop!!!

**Zazz:** COLD

**Me:** bro stop like fr that doesn’t even make sense the fridge doesn’t have power so it cant be cold

**Zazz:** COLD

**Zazz:** COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD COLD…

He’s still typing more COLDs when I show the texts to Lisbeth and she goes full nuclear. She flings the phone on the carpet and shouts, “JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!! This is NOT funny and YOU need to tell your friend what an IDIOT he’s being…” and on and on. Then she grabs my arm and tells me we’re gonna find him and chain him to his room to be *grounded for life* but first she’s gonna strangle him!!!

(I’m starting to think she might actually have a little crush on him too and that her love language is rage)

Ten minutes later we’re at the dump site. I’m scrambling to keep up, in such a hurry climbing over all the trash that I almost don’t notice when my foot hits something with a *crack.* I stop. Step back, frowning. “Lisbeth?”

“WHAT?” she snaps.

On the ground under my shoe is Zazz’s phone.

Lisbeth snatches up the phone and wipes it off. “Fuckin’ idiot. He’s gonna be pissed.”

My phone buzzes again as Lisbeth heads down toward the fridge.

**Zazz:** COLD

“Lisbeth,” I whisper.

She’s yelling at the fridge door that Zazz is an idiot, waving his phone and announcing that he dropped it. The phone in her hand is black, cracked, dead. The fingers of her other hand grip the refrigerator’s rusted handle.

My phone buzzes.

**Zazz:** R U HERE?

“Don’t open it!” I shriek.

She looks back at me, confused. “Huh?”

“DON’T OPEN IT!!!”

“He’s in there! He’ll be stuck from his own dumb prank if we don’t open it.”

“DON’T!!!” I shout, hysterical.

“Let me go! I have to open it!”

We fight, back and forth, and my phone keeps vibrating with texts COLD COLD COLD even though the phone in Lisbeth’s hand is dead. I try to tell her it’s dead but she tells me there’s a delay, that I’m being irrational, that he obviously dropped it just as he was hurrying into the fridge but no no no the phone’s *dark* and *wet* and the screen protector has *water* under it meaning he dropped it *before* the rain stopped maybe even before it started last night so how, how was he texting from a dead phone—and then she shoves me, hard, so I stumble back and fall on my ass. She grabs the rusted door and *puuuullllls—*

Her shriek mingles with the shriek of the door as it falls open.

For seconds I’m frozen, too terrified to move. I feel something warm trickle on my leg. Then I creep round to my sister, looking over her shoulder.

He looks peaceful, his head turned to one side. His skin is sort of greyish. With his limbs all tucked up, his face composed in sleep, he looks so young in there—almost like one of those kids he was talking about.

I wait for his chest to rise and fall.

“He’s faking,” I say.

Lisbeth is crying.

“He’s gotta be faking,” I say.

Lisbeth turns and runs—and I back up from the refrigerator, in a daze, still waiting for his chest to move but it doesn’t. There’s a rotting smell, but not like knock you down rotting. It seems like the stench of the fridge itself, of the decades old air trapped inside. Stale air that tastes a bit rank and very, very *cold*.

I turn and scramble after her.

\*\*\*

When the police arrive at the dump site, the fridge is rusted closed so they have to call in a construction crew to bust the door clean off but inside is nothing but old stains and they doubt a teenager could even fit in there unless he really scrunched. “Missing person,” is their official verdict.

It’s not exactly right, though.

See, my sis keeps getting flowers.

Scattered in her room or outside her door or, more often, tumbling out of the refrigerator when she opens it—dried, pressed, dead flowers.

She thinks it’s his ghost. *I* think the fact we didn’t find a body means he’s alive, but just too chicken to show himself. Like he doesn’t know how to end this fridge game cause everyone’s so pissed at him so he’s just… still pretending. And since he doesn’t have his phone no one has any way of communicating with him. So yesterday, I put his dead phone back at the dump site in what’s left of the fridge. Like maybe he can throw it in some rice or something. And once he does, maybe he’ll get my messages.

So Zazz, if you can read this, Lisbeth would like it much better if you could give her the flowers *in person.*

The fridge is broken. You can’t pretend to be stuck in it anymore. Come back.

UPDATE:

Holy freaking balls Zazz just responded to my texts!

**Me:** pls come back pls pls pls

**Zazz:** OK

**Me:** omg omg omg omfg!!! U found ur phone! Hey bro r u rly coming back? Pls pls pls come back we all miss u!!!!!

**Zazz:** OMW

*Finally*! Lisbeth is gonna be so happy when he hands her those flowers *in person!* His mom’s gonna be so happy. Aiden and Kisha and everyone’s gonna be [so happy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
