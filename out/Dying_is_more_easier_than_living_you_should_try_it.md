As  I stared out of the window, a dog was sleeping on that cold-hearted night, the same dog which was crying just a moment ago, probably, failed  to fill his stomach again but what really amazed me was that he never loses his hope, does he is not known to the unidentified emotion of  hopelessness or is he just strong enough to overpower it?

I  have waited long enough to get the strength to kill this feeling but  this monster is in my blood now, I tried to suppress it but I am not the dictator of my own body anymore, days feel long, the night feels suffocated.

I was happy that  finally, something is in my control, finally, I have taken a decision  without getting afraid. A spark of hope strikes me when I picked up that rope from my table’s box but while it was grabbing me, around my neck a  deep ball of thoughts hit my head, the face of my helpless mom hiding  from my dad, the face of my user who cheated me, the face of a failure,  the face of my bully but now, I am not a loser anymore, I will win from  this monster but I don’t think that even hell will accept me.

As  I kicked the chair away from my feet, that rope hold me tighter and  tighter as a trustful father, a feeling that I have never felt before, I  could see the world disappearing in front of my eyes but there was  peace, a peace which I have never experienced in my life, the silence of  not able to think anything else, it was the moment I realize that death  is a lot easier and simple than living but I wondered what stopped me  doing this till now…...

A sudden  spark of light crashed into my eyes; loud noise passed into my ears. I  was in the hospital. I could see the nurse and said, why?

She gave me a shocked face, maybe she was expecting “who?” in the form of the question.

“There  was a robbery in your neighbor’s house but your neighbor woke up  because a street dog started barking at the thief, he saw that thief  running into your apartment and he never saw him coming out. So, the  police decided to ask from every house on that floor. They knocked on  your house but you didn’t answer. So, they doubt that the thief was in  your house but they found you like that,” she said.

I  was feeling like a dead body thinking about that feeling which lasted  for a few seconds iin the end, I was still a loser, a loser who even  lost to die.

SO,  I am a teen and  want to become a writer, this is my practice page,  PLS give me ur  review/opinion, it is supposed to be from psychological  genre.(english  is not my native language)
