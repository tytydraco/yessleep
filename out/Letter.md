Hello, how have you been? I hope you're doing okay.

No- scratch that. I know you're doing great. I know you're perfectly following what I want, actually. I see you. Always. You might not notice me, but I never take my sight off you. Not for a second. I can't. I won't. The thought of looking away, even for a moment, sends a twist through my gut.

As for me? Oh, I'm fine. "Fine" is a word people say when they don’t want to explain how much they’re not fine. I am not fine. I am starving. Starving for the moment you finally see me. Just once. Just a flicker of recognition, that's all I need. The briefest second where our eyes lock, where your mind finally registers what has always been watching from the edges of your life.

But when that happens, when you see me, truly see me, it will be over. For you. For Me. For Everything.

I have always been around you. Since the moment of your birth, actually. In the hospital room, watching from the vent in the operating room, unseen, unnoticed. You were the one my life was assigned to. The one I was bound to. The one I was meant to be with.


Ah, how I have enjoyed lurking in your periphery. How I have enjoyed making you cry as a baby, how thrilled I was everytime you ran to your parents' room from a nightmare I gave you, how happy I was everytime you snuck out to go to a party.

How I have relished slipping just beyond your line of sight. The way your skin prickles when you enter a dark room, that sudden, overwhelming certainty that someone -something- is right there, waiting. That’s me.

I am the shadow curling at the corner of your doorway. The silence after your music stops. The head you expect to see peeking from the darkness, but never does. The noises you tell yourself are just the neighbors upstairs, the wind outside, the house settling, those ones you refuse to get up to check out.

I am the reason your dog perks his ears at nothing. The reason your cat hisses at the empty hallway.

I am the dripping faucet. The creaking closet. The cracking fridge. The squeaky hinge. The ticking clock. The screeching lock.

I am your Anxiety. Your Heartache. Your Everlasting Terror.

I am The One.

The one tasked with tormenting your soul. The one meant to lead you astray. The one who takes pride in every line of coke you sniff, every heroin stamp that burns against your tongue, every bottle you drain in the dark. The one who loves feeding you thoughts and letting you finish my work. The one who watches, delighted, as you waste away, as you drown in your own indulgence, as you choose to ruin yourself.

You curse my name. You blame me for all the filth, all the wreckage of your life. But I have never forced your hand. I only whispered, only watched, only waited.

I am the Silence, the Void, just 'your void', desperate to make you join me, without you, I cease to exist, and when I finally walk in your room on a casual friday afternoon, and all your fears are realized, I will capture your soul. When that moment comes, when your eyes, ears, hands finally register what has been with you all along, I will be content, for the first and last time.
I will watch as the light drains from your eyes, as your breath stills, as your final thought is one acknowledging of Me.

Who am I you ask? 
I am No One, but Everywhere.
