The night of my graduation ended late. Not because of the party—that died out quickly—but because of the silence that remained afterward.

My mother went to bed as soon as the last guests left. She said she was tired, that we’d talk tomorrow. She closed the bedroom door carefully, as if she didn’t want the sound to wake someone else in the house. Someone who wasn’t asleep.

My father stayed in the kitchen.

I knew because I heard the clink of glass against glass. A minimal sound. Too clear for a house that should already have been at rest.

He wasn’t drinking.

Not for years.

When I went in, he was standing by the table, an open bottle and two glasses in front of him. He poured his first. The stream was clumsy; a few drops spilled and slid slowly along the wood. He didn’t wipe them away. He stared at them for a second, as if waiting for them to do something more.

“Everything okay?” I asked.

He nodded without looking at me.

The kitchen light was the same as always. Yellow, tired. The same one that had lit rushed breakfasts, small arguments, Sundays with nothing special. There were no strange shadows or dark corners. That was the first thing that unsettled me: everything was exactly where it was supposed to be.

He sat across from me. It took him longer than usual, as if he’d forgotten the order of the movements. He set the glass on the table with excessive care. His hands trembled just slightly, enough to make me doubt whether I’d really seen it.

“Congratulations,” he finally said.

I smiled. I thanked him. We talked a bit about the ceremony, about how fast time had gone by, about how strange it felt to finish something so long. Polite conversation. Predictable. If someone had walked in at that moment, they wouldn’t have noticed anything out of place.

Except that my father didn’t drink.

He lifted the glass, held it at chest level, and stayed like that. He didn’t toast. He didn’t say anything. He took a short sip and let the air escape as if he hadn’t realized he’d been holding it.

“Are you going to stay up for a while?” he asked.

“Yes.”

He nodded again. Looked down the hallway that led to the bedrooms. Listened. Then looked back at me, but not at my eyes. Never at my eyes.

“I wanted to talk to you before,” he said. “Before you start all this.”

I didn’t know what he meant, but I didn’t ask.

He poured himself another drink. This time he didn’t spill a drop. The motion was firmer, almost rehearsed.

“I already told you I don’t like the idea,” he went on. “The platform.”

There it was. He said it like a dirty word, something that shouldn’t be spoken too loudly. He’d mentioned it before, always in passing, always to shut the conversation down quickly. Never like this.

“Dad, we’ve already talked about it,” I said. “It’s what I want to do. It’s good money. It’s stable. You know that better than anyone.”

He didn’t look up. He slowly turned the glass on the table, drawing a wet circle that overlapped the previous one.

“It’s not what it seems,” he said.

I waited.

“None of it is what it seems.”

There was something rehearsed in the sentence, as if he’d repeated it many times in his head without ever finding the moment to say it out loud. I leaned forward without realizing it.

“What do you mean?”

He fell silent. Long enough. The kind of silence that doesn’t feel empty, but charged, as if something were about to fill it. Outside, the wind softly moved something—maybe a branch, maybe nothing—and then stillness returned.

“I don’t want you to go there,” he finally said. “I don’t want you to see what I saw.”

He didn’t say it angrily. Not with fear, either. He said it like a fact, a conclusion he’d reached too late.

“See what?”

He shook his head slowly. Ran a hand over his face. His fingers paused for a second at his right temple, pressed, released.

“It doesn’t matter,” he murmured. “That’s the worst part. That it doesn’t matter and still…”

He didn’t finish the sentence.

Without asking permission, a memory from my childhood surfaced. Muffled shouts behind the closed bedroom door. My mother getting up quickly, speaking in a low voice. The next day, nothing. Normal breakfast. Ironed shirts. Silence.

I never asked him about it.

“You always say you did well there,” I said. “That thanks to that job, we’re where we are.”

He smiled. Barely. A grimace that didn’t go anywhere.

“They’re still paying me,” he said.

It wasn’t new information, but that night it sounded different. As if it weren’t a benefit, but a condition.

“Even though I’m not there anymore.”

He looked up for the first time and, for a second, I thought he was going to look straight at me. He didn’t. His eyes stayed just off to the side, fixed on the wall, on a point with nothing on it.

“I worked on that platform,” he said. “For years. And I never wanted to tell you why I left.”

The kitchen clock marked the hour with a dry click. I felt that sound draw a boundary, like a line you couldn’t cross back over.

“I didn’t want you to know,” he went on. “I thought if I didn’t say it, if I left it behind… it would stay there.”

He took another sip. This time he drank more than I expected. He coughed lightly. He didn’t seem used to it.

“But now you want to go,” he said. “And that means it didn’t stay there.”

He went quiet. The glass trembled between his fingers and I had the impulse to reach out and steady it. I didn’t. I didn’t know if I should.

“Where exactly is it?” I asked, carefully.

He frowned, as if the question weren’t simple.

“In the middle of the sea,” he replied. “Near where there’s nothing else left.”

He didn’t give coordinates. He didn’t say names. He didn’t need to.

Outside, the night was calm. Too calm for what had just entered the kitchen with us.

My father inhaled deeply, as if preparing to submerge, and when he spoke again, his voice was different. Lower. More distant.

“At first,” he said, “everything was normal.”

And then he started to tell me.


---

At first, everything was normal.

That was the first thing he said, and he said it with a conviction that unsettled me more than anything else. As if he needed to affirm it for himself before he did for me.

He said the platform was far away. He didn’t give an exact location. He said the trip was long, that the sea became more and more uniform the farther they got from shore, as if the world had grown tired of varying. “In the middle of nowhere,” he repeated several times, though then he corrected himself: it wasn’t exactly nothing. It was something else. Something he didn’t know how to name.

The structure was enormous. Bigger than he’d imagined when he took the job. Too big for the number of people who lived and worked there.

“That was the first thing that seemed strange to me,” he said. “There were few of us. Very few.”

He didn’t say it with alarm. More with belated curiosity. At the time, according to him, he didn’t give it much importance. The pay was good. The shift, stable. The technology wasn’t the newest, but it worked. Big, reliable machines, with a constant noise that at first kept him awake at night and then, without him realizing it, became part of the background of his mind.

He described the corridors as functional. Not labyrinthine, not designed to get lost in. Just repeated. Identical doors, identical signage, stretches of metal that seemed copied and pasted over and over again. He said that in the first weeks he relied heavily on the maps posted on the walls, until he stopped because, somehow, he always ended up getting where he needed to go.

“The problem,” he added after a brief silence, “is that sometimes I didn’t remember how.”

He worked long shifts. Sometimes hours went by without him crossing paths with anyone. Other times he ran into people he hadn’t seen before, coworkers assigned to specific tasks, who seemed to know the place perfectly. Normal people. Normal conversations. Names he heard once.

“The next day they weren’t there,” he said. “Or they were, but no one else seemed to remember them.”

He thought it was his own issue. Fatigue. Isolation. In a place like that, he explained, time becomes strange. Days look too much alike. It’s easy to convince yourself you simply got confused.

He said it with a shrug, as if he were still trying to justify it.

The platform was never silent. That was another detail he emphasized. There was always something running, something vibrating, something emitting a low hum that seeped through the walls and floor. Even at night, even when the shift was minimal, the place seemed to breathe.

“That’s why it took me so long to notice,” he said. “Because the noise was always there.”

Sometimes he went out on deck during the night shifts. Not because it was necessary, but because the air outside felt different. Colder. Cleaner. From there, the sea stretched out in every direction, a dark mass that reflected almost nothing. There were no lights on the horizon. No ships. No reference points.

“When you look at it for a long time,” he said, “it feels like it moves in a way that doesn’t quite fit.”

He didn’t say he’d seen anything. He was careful about that. He said it was more a feeling. As if the wind, passing through the structures, dragged something else along with it. A murmur that never quite became sound. Something that stayed just short of turning into words.

The first times, he attributed it to exhaustion. To the constant noise of the machines mixing with the wind. To lack of sleep. It was easy to convince yourself of that, he insisted. In a place like that, you quickly learn not to ask unnecessary questions.

“Everyone did it,” he said. “No one asked anything.”

There were small details he began to notice over time. Occupied beds in the shared dormitory that later appeared empty, without anyone mentioning a personnel rotation. Tools moved from their place. Lights on in sections that weren’t in use. Nothing serious. Nothing urgent. Things that accumulated without ever quite forming a concrete problem.

“You get used to it,” he repeated. “You get used to everything.”

I realized that phrase appeared more and more often as the story went on, as if it were an automatic defense.

Until one night, coming back from his shift, he decided to go straight to his room.

He said he was tired. More than usual. That the route was simple, one he’d taken hundreds of times. He remembered every turn, every stretch. He was sure he’d taken the right path.

But he walked.

And walked.

And the corridor didn’t end.

At first it didn’t seem strange to him. He thought he’d misjudged the distance. Then he noticed he hadn’t passed any intersections, any new signs. Just the same stretch of metal under his boots, repeating itself.

“That’s when I realized something was wrong,” he said, “because I stopped hearing the machines.”

As he said it, he lowered his voice without realizing it.

First the constant hum. Then the distant pounding. Then the wind. One by one, the sounds disappeared until only the echo of his own footsteps remained. A sound too clear, too close, as if the space around him had shrunk.

He stopped. He listened. Nothing.

“Not even the sea,” he said. “And that didn’t make sense.”

He kept walking. He didn’t know for how long. He looked at his watch several times, but the gesture quickly lost meaning. The corridor stayed the same. The light stayed on. Everything seemed to function as it should, except for the fact that it didn’t lead anywhere.

“I felt out of place,” he said. “Like I’d taken a step in the wrong direction and the rest of the world hadn’t noticed yet.”

That was when he felt something on his back.

Not a blow. Not a shove. Something lighter. A brief contact, enough to pull him out of the suspended state he’d fallen into. He spun around abruptly and reacted without thinking. A punch thrown with all the strength he had left.

The man who fell to the floor shouted his name.

“It was a coworker,” my father said. “He was looking for me.”

They explained later that he hadn’t shown up for dinner. That no one could find him. That they checked several sections before they finally did. That he was standing in front of the control room door, staring inside, not moving.

“They said they called me several times,” he added. “I didn’t hear anything.”

He paused for a long time after that. Took another sip. His hands started to tremble again.

“When they took me,” he went on, “the door was already open.”

He didn’t explain why no one questioned that. Neither did I.

“The screen was on,” he said. “One of the cameras. Pointing downward.”

He fell silent again. This time, longer.

“It didn’t show anything special,” he added at last. “Just the seafloor.”

I waited for him to say more. He didn’t. He stared at the glass as if an answer might appear there.

“They told me I was there for hours,” he finally said. “Looking at that.”

I asked him what he’d seen.

He shook his head slowly.

“Nothing,” he replied. “And that’s what ruined me.”

He didn’t look up when he said the last sentence. Outside, the wind moved against the house again, and for a moment I had the absurd sensation that the sound wasn’t coming from outside, but from something sliding very slowly, very far away, beneath a surface I couldn’t see.

My father took a deep breath, as if he were about to continue.

He didn’t.


---

A long time passed before he spoke about it again.

For weeks, maybe months, he acted as if that conversation had never happened. He went back to his routine, to comfortable silences, to short answers. If anyone mentioned the sea or his old job, he changed the subject with apparent ease. I quickly learned not to insist.

But something had changed.

He started sleeping with the hallway light on. He said it was because of my nighttime footsteps, even though I no longer lived there. Sometimes I’d find him awake in the middle of the night, sitting in the kitchen, listening to the house as if he were waiting for something to finish settling into place.

“The noise is the first thing that warns you,” he said one night, without me asking anything. “When it disappears… it’s already too late.”

I didn’t know what to say.

One day, while we were sorting old boxes in the garage, I found a notebook. It had no date or title. Just pages filled with irregular notes, numbers, incomplete diagrams. Sketches of corridors that branched and came back together. Arrows that led nowhere.

“Is this from the platform?” I asked.

He glanced at it for barely a second before slamming the box shut.

“No,” he said. “That was after.”

I didn’t press him. But that night, when everyone was asleep, I opened the notebook again.

The first pages were technical. Schedules. Shifts. Maintenance lists. All normal. Then, little by little, the content became erratic. Cut-off sentences. Repetitions.

Do not walk without noise.
If the noise changes, go back.
If there is no noise, do not look back.

There were entire pages dedicated to describing sounds. Not words, but clumsy attempts to capture them: wavy lines, ink stains, margin notes that said too deep, too close.

On a page near the end, I found something different.

A simple drawing. A black rectangle. Below it, a line that looked like the floor. Above it, nothing. And on the side, written in firmer handwriting:

It doesn’t rise. It waits.

I closed the notebook with a feeling I couldn’t name.

The next day, my father was gone.

He didn’t leave a note. His phone was on the table, turned off. The back door was ajar, as if he’d gone out for air and never come back in.

We found him hours later, on the beach.

He was standing with the water up to his ankles, staring at the horizon. He didn’t move. He didn’t react when we called him. When we touched him, he flinched slightly, as if waking from a very deep sleep.

“It makes noise,” he said, without looking at us. “It still makes noise.”

We took him home. He didn’t sleep that night.

Neither did I.

Near dawn, I heard something different. Not the wind. Not the house settling. Something lower. More constant. A sound that didn’t come from any specific place, but seemed to be everywhere at once.

I got up and found him in the living room, standing in front of the turned-off television.

“Do you hear it?” he asked.

I shook my head, even though I was no longer sure.

“It’s rising,” he said. “Not fast. Never fast.”

I tried to convince him to sit down, to rest. He looked at me with a strange expression, almost compassionate.

“That’s the worst part,” he said. “It’s not coming for us. It never was about us. It just… occupies the space we leave empty.”

The sound stopped abruptly.

The silence was absolute.

My father smiled.

“That’s it,” he whispered. “Now, yes.”

The television screen turned on by itself.

It showed a fixed image. Dark. Grainy. For a second I thought it was broken. Then I made out the seafloor. Motionless. No currents. No suspended particles.

And something else.

Not a clear shape. Not a body. Just a difference. A space where the darkness seemed denser, as if the water avoided fully occupying it.

I felt pressure in my ears. Immediate, physical discomfort.

“Don’t look too long,” my father said, without looking away. “Learn not to.”

The image flickered.

When it came back, the television was off.

My father collapsed onto the couch, exhausted, as if he’d just finished an endless shift. He was breathing with difficulty, but he was alive. Asleep, maybe.

The silence returned to the house, this time incomplete. Fragile.

The next morning, the sea was especially calm.

Too calm.


Edit: He’s been standing on the porch for over three hours now, staring at the sea. He hasn’t moved. I don’t think he’s blinked once.
I was going to call my boss and tell him I can’t take the job anymore.
But the longer I listen to the silence, the more I feel like it’s already too late.
