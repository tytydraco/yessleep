I know it has been some time since the last update, but things have transpired rather superfluously. I had hoped this deal I made, the longer I took to write down these experiences, the longer I stretched them out…. I had hoped it would grant me some time, but this has cost me. Cynthia has now been roped into this, and so has Rose. 



I tried to fight, move my muscles, go against the ebb and flow of the macabre, gooey dark molasses that has been stripping away my being only to lose a few more layers of my psyche to expose the already rotting insides that I always knew had existed long before I had been a part of any of this. 



… Let's start this one differently; let me give it another shot. After all, these are supposed to be cathartic entries for me and entertaining for you. 



Setu's rendition of the symbol had me scouring the web like a maniac for at least two days, and what I found didn't instill confidence either. The most I could gather was that it was the symbol of a fallen God, a forgotten God barely mentioned in the dark corners of forums, belonging to threads I posted that would either get archived or deleted within hours. But for those few hours, while the thread was up, I would get comments that would tell me —



*Looks bad*



*Nice try Edgelord*



*What, are we letting anyone post random things now?*



*That's sacrilege, you know how offensive that is? Istg, people will twist and turn holy symbols just to get a reaction. You want me to turn the cross sideways and then turn it into a crude Swastika?*



*The last we entertained such a thread, it turned out to be a 13-year-old who had just found his dad's old Victorian horror stories*.



But then, one comment offered me hope.



*Idk dude but if you're serious about this, everything looks wrong, it looks upside down, looks mirrored, the serpent encircling it is moving in the opposite direction….This doesn't represent eternity…it represents eternal torment…and the symbol…Idk who it is…but whoever it is, has either fallen, is doomed, or once betrayed wherever it came from*

\- 

I remember the first two comments because they would always show up, I remember the third one clearly because that's what told me that this was symbolic and holy to someone at the least. The fourth one I remember because it had sent me down a rabbit hole of someone who was suffering the same fate as me a few months ago, albeit fictionally. The kid had ended the 6-month long thread with a photo of the monster that stalked him at night…the link to the photo Rick Rolled everyone invested. 



I still chuckle about it as I write this…the last one…the last one stuck with me, sticks with me because I would soon come to find out that some random stranger on the internet had tried to warn me of what I was getting into, but every protest against my desire to visit the island, every obstacle, every statistical or logistical problem only brought out the worst in me. 



I had ignored this comment thinking that someone was simply trolling me, trying to scare me even more than I was. I had also decided to lie to Setu, falsely promising his identity would be protected. Because after the interviews, after the symbol, after its potential meaning being unveiled, the pit in my stomach had grown to a gargantuan size. It had swallowed my morals, had twisted my intents and had put out a shoddy copy of my identity that I stupidly took as my own. I know people often say that if they could go back in time, they would stop their former selves….they would stop themselves before it was too late ….I wouldn't. I wouldn't dare even try…



I had lied to Setu, I had lied to Bala that the terms had changed after Carl and the rest had seen the footage, I had lied to Carl that there was even going to be a documentary to show in the first place…and I had lied to Mr. Sastry by handing over $15,000 and promising the rest once I had wrapped up the project. Faking a contract was easy; averting his gaze as his adopted son fell deeper into the web of my lies was even easier… 



I had become this vile chameleon that would instantly adapt to scenarios to get what it wanted. Back then, I had thought of myself as a hero …a hero saving Setu, a hero helping him find his origins, a hero doing what the world should've done long ago… a visionary on the frontier of the unexplored… but now I know, I was a fool barking and gnawing at the trust of my people and dragging them to the edge of the world and into the maw of something that would one day eventually change the meaning of ….creation. 



And so, assuming that nobody would understand me, nobody would understand my burden, I began to sow seeds of mistrust and curiosity that would eventually lead me where I had always wanted to go. Setu was, by all means, a stalwart man, but I had also gained his trust; I had become a confidant he never knew he needed. Years ago, he had tried to learn more about his past but was always shut down by his parents; he had always tried to look more into it, but they had always averted his curiosity. But now, as an outsider, I could exploit that, and before you knew it, he was itching to learn more about his past, just like I had planned. 



Bala however, was another story, he had grown to resent me, our friendly banter had ended the day the "documentary" was approved and funded. I had paid him in full, and maybe he found that disrespectful, but in hindsight, he was probably onto me. Bala had stuck around for a week as I prodded Setu and the Sastry family for minute details. But then out of the blue, he had come to my room one morning and had quit. 



"I need a change of pace, I need a taste of normality, I am going back to Chennai"



"Sure… Wait… is something wrong? I know we haven't exactly been talking lately but you know I think of you as a friend Bala….right?"



I still remember him staring into my eyes then… If I was me, I would've known what that stare meant, but I wasn't and so I didn't. 



"Goodbye Phillip. Maybe we'll see each other again soon…"



I nodded, handed Bala some extra cash, and watched him drive away. By then I had learned my way around the culture better, I had bought myself a used car, had learned how to deal with swindlers, and most importantly, had found my preference when it came to food. And then one fateful night, while I was exhaling clouds of cancer, lost in the thoughts of how to take my machinations a step further, there was a knock on my room's door… It was Setu. I had welcomed him in, and when Setu spoke… I knew the seeds I had planted had finally sprouted…



"Do you really think there are more out there Phillip?"



"I don't know man… you're a miracle to be honest, finding another miracle in this lifetime seems like a heavy dose of optimism even for me…"



"I am starting to believe that you might be right…"



Part of me wanted to jump and probe Setu further, but by then I had become this evil chef of spiced lies and so I waited with bated breath as I let Setu cook… He took his sweet time, but eventually continued much to my sadistic pleasure…



"I …remember what I told you what I thought about my parents?"



I nodded and sighed, playing my part of a trusted confidant and friend to perfection. Setu always had strong feelings about his biological parents. He didn't hate them, but to him, there was an unknown fear and trepidation associated with them. He had hinted at this when I had initially started to peel his layers, but over the past two weeks, he had revealed how he truly felt. As far as I had gathered, Setu had repressed memories and buried feelings. Whenever he thought about them, he felt fear, dread, he got uneasy and twitchy but as I would come to know through this conversation, he had finally managed to peel away a layer that I had failed to pierce despite my desperation. 



"I wonder if she would recognize me… I wonder if he would…would they regret or rejoice if they ever knew that I was still alive? They'd probably shun me though…considering how protective the tribe is when it comes to interactions with the mainland"



I simply nodded and continued my stoic impersonation of someone actively listening to a friend. In reality, I was struggling to ignore the itch under my skin to push Setu towards my ultimate goal. 



"Do you remember them? Their faces, the island, anything?"



He shook his head, "No… no, just my gut screaming at me, my mind searching for memories that should be there but aren't…"



I knew I had to stall this, and so I allowed silence to sink its teeth into our conversation and after a minute or so, Setu spoke up



"So… if there are no more survivors, no one to interview… how are you going to make the documentary…"



"I mean your interview and existence alone might be enough…" I sighed pretending and acting like I had been defeated…



"But you can't be sure that it will prove to be worth it right?"



"No, …Maybe… but certainly not after I've paid you in full… I'd be swimming in debt by then…"



I put on a brave face while hoping my chest would endure the loud thumps, the huge hits my ribs were taking from my heart with each beat, knowing too well that the moment was coming…



"Ever thought about going to the island?"



"No…hah that'd be crazy and illegal. Why? Are you thinking of going back?"



Setu looked out of the window and into the distance, his eyes desperately trying to find an Island that I now know was stuck in his head, just like it was stuck in mine…



"I tried denying myself that freedom, but a part of me feels like its my right to go back if that's where I belong. Find out what happened back then, why did my family lose me…are they still alive?"



"I.. understand…"



I wanted to say so much more but that would've blown it. It took all my strength to hold myself back until Setu proposed the idea himself, which was crucial. 



"Do you think we can make it there? I mean it would be pretty sweet… you'll get footage and information that could complete your documentary…."



"Yeah…yeah it would be nice… but you're better off dreaming, getting there would be a nightmare and getting past your parents, your father especially… would be hell…"



Again, after a long pause…



"What if I was able to convince them? What if somehow they weren't part of this equation… Could you make it happen?"



"Wait… you're actually serious about this? SETU IF we get caught we'd be sent to prison for god knows how long! And I am not risking that or your life especially after knowing what your parents fear ever since I showed up to interview you…"



"You sound like them…but this is my life… my past. I have a right to know…"



*Silence*



"You should think this over man… give it a good week or so at least"



"I have… I have been thinking about this ever since you told me that I could be from the island… Can you do it? Do you think you can pull this off?" 



I sighed, and acted my part and after some deliberate performance of contemplating my options, I said…



"Let me look into it"



Setu nodded, we shook hands, and he then left my room. I'll confess I spied on him from my window and after he had passed the hotel gate, I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was done, and my dream was coming true. All I had to do was pretend and waste a few days, preferably a week in the name of research. In actuality, all of that was already done. My key and safe passage to the island was through a man named Abbas. 



Now, before I tell you about Abbas, let me confess something: I had assumed that my manipulation was what had pushed Setu to go back to the island, but in reality, the reason was something that he would confess on our way to the island. A confession I still hope he had made that night, or even before we left, because the dream Setu had, which prompted him to take this step, was a warning in disguise, a warning that he misinterpreted as a calling. 



Now, about Abbas, Carl and I had met the guy at a late-night party in Pondicherry, he dealt with rather illicit and provocative substances, and so I had naturally exchanged numbers with him in case I was back in India and wanted to experience the high life again. I had contacted him a few days ago, and under the guise of getting to know him better, I had learned that his people smuggled in various substances from Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines through illegal sea routes. And so I was supposed to meet him in Chennai a few days later. Coincidentally, the doctor who treated Setu was also in the same city. Abbas had helped me track him down, which gave me hope that he would be able to help me reach the island. 



However, upon reaching Chennai, things weren't off to a great start. Dr. Kumar wasn't exactly cooperative, and that was because I hadn't told Mr. Sastry that I had tracked him down. The man didn't know I was in contact with the family, and I didn't want the Sastrys to know that I was stalking their son's old doctor. Eventually, I was forced to show him their interviews, and it was then that he decided to calm down and meet with me officially at his home. When I reached there the next day, I was greeted by a quaint two-story house that was a rather pleasant contrast to the bustling life in the heart of the city. Dr. Sai Kumar was already waiting for me in the yard. 



He had two chairs set up for both of us, and when I took a seat, he promptly ordered tea for us. Though this setup appeared welcoming, this was clearly his way of testing me, making sure I didn't get to interact with his family, and ordering tea for me without knowing my preference seemed like another power move. I liked that everyone in the South of India preferred coffee, and so I had grown used to it being the staple drink, but now, here I was on a hot and humid Chennai mornin,g surrounded under the shade of palm trees, having some hot tea. I didn't want to start the conversation on a bad note, and thus I begrudgingly sipped the tea and said…



"Thanks for meeting me Mr. Kumar… you have a lovely place"



He simply nodded, clearly wanting to get over the pleasantries as soon as possible…



"Thanks Phillip. Let's get one thing straight before we talk… I don't want to be on tape, I don't want to be a part of your documentary because frankly talking about my patients without their consent, is breaking the law and my oath.."



"I know Doctor, and that can be fixed"



I took out my phone, dialed Setu and handed it over to the Doctor. His face was like an ocean of expression, each consecutive wave bringing along a new one, it started with curious, then familiarity and happiness upon talking to Setu which was then followed by confusion when I assume Setu granted him permission to talk about his medical history, and then eventually defeat when he realized that he would now have to talk to me. Of course the entire conversation was in the native language so I didn't know what they talked about, but when Doctor Kumar handed the phone back to me, he said…



"Fine Philip. You seem to know your way, and Setu seems to trust you. What do you want to know?"



"Everything, but before we start, do I have permission to record your audio? You don't have to be on camera if you don't want but your audio will be of tremendous help."



He nodded, ordered his servant to get him some documents and then started. I quickly pressed the record button on my audio recorder and placed it between us. 



"Setu's case was unique but not untreatable. Yes, he was malnourished, dehydrated, sunburnt but nothing that was untreatable. That is until the wound on his back began to act up…"



By this time his servant had brought him the necessary files and after flipping through a few pages, he handed me two photographs. It was the wound on Setu's back and it was gnarly. There was a huge gash between his shoulder blades and the skin around it was purple and black. There were tiny holes, missing flesh, as though cookie cutter fishes had had a field day while he was in water. The tea almost jumped from my stomach back into the cup but I managed to control my reflexes. The wound was horrid, and imagining that on the back of someone who was only 7 or 8 years old still gives me nightmares. But this was only the beginning…



"Yeah…and these photos were taken 5 days after Setu was recovered. I had him on IV from the first day and even attempted a debridement surgery in the confines of the home. We were able to remove the highly affected tissue but there was no positive response from his body. The wound culture didn’t raise any alarms but this made Setu’s case all the more puzzling from a medical perspective. I was administering every antibiotic ideal for his condition considering his weight and the results of the culture, yet it seemed to have no effect. The fever would suppress with every dose but the wound showed no signs of healing. ”



He then pointed to the photos,



“These holes you see, we assumed this was done by sea life at first, but then…look at this…"



Dr. Kumar handed me another paper, this time an MRI. I didn't know what I was looking at, and so Dr. Kumar explained it to me and once I realized what he was trying to say, chills ran down my spine. The holes led all the way to Setu's spine…



"Now we tried stitching them up the first day he was brought in. The stitches held for a day, but then dissolved all on their own after 24 hours. Reluctantly and after consultation with some of my other colleagues in Chennai, we decided to use Staples…but 24 hours later, the skin had lesioned and separated on its own…the tissue seemed to be rejecting treatment"



"So….. you're telling me that somehow, the holes were forced open?"



Dr. Kumar didn't want to answer that question and his following words made that clear. 



"You see the holes weren't that big, only 2 to 3 cm in diameter, but the bigger wound, that was my biggest concern. At first I thought sepsis had begun its course, but then that MRI showed something else, a foreign mass."



He then pointed to a very dark area that at first seemed to be a part of the surrounding back muscles around the spine.



"Unfortunately for Setu, I spotted that anomaly after 3 weeks. During those three weeks, we tried everything, from simple bandages to speculation of skin grafts. Despite Mr. Sastry's unwavering stance on not involving any other doctor, I consulted with many and even brought my daughter with me to observe Setu behind his back. She was in the last year of her medical college and she was the one who spotted the anomaly when I showed her the MRI scan."



"What was it, Doctor?"



"As I said, a foreign organic mass. It seemed to resemble the muscle tissue from which it was extracted at first, but once separated, we preserved the sample in formalin, but within hours, its cellular structure collapsed. By the time I had finished  patching up Setu after the procedure, the mass had lost its original structure, and by the time I was able to analyze it hours later at the hospital, I realized it had suffered from acute cellular degradation."



"Did you do any other tests?"



"There wasn't much to learn after that happened. We debated sending it for advanced testing, but Mr. Sastry was adamant. Any formal lab would generate records that could expose Setu. "



"So that was it then…"



He nods. "After that, the boy recovered miraculously; the stitches held their ground, With the mass removed, systemic antibiotics and wound management finally began to show rapid improvement. Setu was saved from the verge of sepsis. He was kept on nutritional fluids and Vitamins for a few months but that's the extent of that. 



"Did his parents ever take him to a psychologist?"



Dr. Kumar gave me a cold hard stare after that one. I knew he knew something but his words implied otherwise…



"Not that I know of Philip no"



To avoid overstaying my welcome, I made copies of the photos and the MRI scan and left his residence. Dr. Kumar had given me more than enough information needed but right now I needed to focus on my meeting with Abbas, and how I was going to help me arrange my excursion to North Sentinel Island. 

— 

I am exhausted after that one, having confessed what I have and facing what I've done and how it started has taken its toll on me. As I mentioned at the start, I can't use this to prolong my control either. Not after experiencing the consequences firsthand… as for the image Setu had drawn, I couldn't find it, but I have attached my own rendition of it below. I have tried to be accurate rather than artistic, neither of us were artists to begin with…
