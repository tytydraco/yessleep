“Jericho!” My boss smiled at me once I finally stepped out of my car. It had been a long drive for me, and after being on the road for over 10 hours, I was happy to see a friendly face. 

He was an older man who wore his weight well. He looked strong and carried an axe in one hand and a briefcase in the other. His jacket had what I assumed to be the Mercy Hollows logo on the left side, right above his pocket. A dove holding a fancy-looking tree branch with three triangles around the bottom. His boots sported the same logo. 

“Hi, sir.” I smiled and met his eyes. They were green, and he looked exhausted.

“I want to get you set up as soon as possible. The campers will be here tomorrow.” He paused and laughed a bit, “just call me Matt.”

I followed Matt through the first part of the camp. As we walked up a hill, I saw some cabins on the right side of the field. I looked down at the grass; it was extremely well-kept. But there was nothing else out here; it wasn’t until we continued walking that I saw the main building. 

Sitting just beyond the hill, surrounded by trees, there was a large building made out of metal and brick. The building was white and seemed to pop out of the trees. The logo sat proudly right above the double doors. 

“This is not what I was expecting,” I confessed. 

Matt laughed and shook his head as we approached the building. 

“Don’t worry, you’ll get a map of the land. This is the building where you’ll be spending most of your time. The boys and girls live here.” Matt said as he took a set of what had to be 100 keys from his pocket and unlocked the doors. 

“If they stay here, what about the cabins?” I asked as I followed him inside. 

“They will be explained later,” Matt said as he took me through the building.

As my boots hit the floor, I couldn’t help but feel like this place felt more like a school than a camp. Though it was open all summer and winter, there were classrooms on the first floor. I wondered what they taught here. 

Matt showed me to the cafeteria; it was about as big as I expected it to be. There were separate tables for staff to sit and each one was a different color. I wanted to ask why, but Matt wanted to get the tour moving. 

The first floor also had an auditorium with a band room off to the side. He showed me to the art room next; there were paintings all over the wall but I didn’t get a good chance to look around. He showed me the science lab after that, and the woodworking room last. I was told that we offered a lot of activities and if I ever get confused, check my handbook. 

“Upstairs is where the dorms are. Girls on the left-hand side and boys on the right-hand side,” Matt said as he checked his watch. 

“The other employees should be arriving soon. Follow me to your office.” Matt said as he moved quickly down the hallway. I was confused because I knew there were more floors; it seemed like he was in a rush to end the tour early.

As we approached my office, I paused to look at the decorated doors that were on either side of mine.

“You work with two other counselors,” Matt said as he handed me a silver key. 

Matt turned and motioned to a door with a pink trim and owl decals on it. Some roses were pinned to the doorframe, “Laura works in that office. She is the only female counselor on staff. When you meet her, do not forget her face.” Matt said with a seriousness that he had not conveyed to me thus far. 

He shifted his body slightly and pointed to a door with yellow trim; it did not have many other decorations but did sport the camp logo right in the middle of the door. “Adam works there; he is nice,” Matt said as he checked his watch again. 

“Is everything okay?” I asked. 

“Everything is fine, Jericho. Head into the office and read the first chapter of your handbook. I will be seeing you again soon.” Matt said as he turned and walked down the hallway. 

I was half tempted to continue looking around the building, but I didn’t want to be the clueless new guy, so I did as I was told and went into my office instead. My office had a large desk and a comfortable black chair. It wasn’t decorated, and that made sense; I figured that we each had to decorate our offices in our own time if we wanted to decorate them at all. 

As I shut the door and took the room in, I noticed a set of scratches on the door behind me. I stopped, crouched, and ran my hand along them. It seemed like someone was trying to scratch through the door from the inside. 

I stood up and examined the empty bookshelf, and after that, I walked over to the closet. I was surprised to see that it was a good size. When I opened it I found my uniform and simply stepped into the closet to get changed. 

After getting changed, I walked over to the last door in the room and went to open the door; it was locked, so I tried to use my key. The key didn’t fit, so I peeked into the room using the sliver of glass that the door had for a window. There was a bed in there and some crates. Once I tried the door a few more times, I gave up and walked back to my desk to check my handbook. 

\-

I nearly choked when I saw the table of contents, 400+ pages of rules, regulations, and what I needed to know. There was no way that I could finish the handbook in one day. Regardless, I flipped to chapter one as I was instructed. Chapter one, page 4, is where the rules started. 

Rule number 1) You must find time in your day to sleep, eat, and rest. Schedule this time with your coworkers. The children need to have a counselor on staff at all times.

Rule number 2) We keep one female counselor on staff at all times. Remember her face and if anyone but her attempts to enter her office, use her desk, or view her employee handbook, kill them. You will know when to attack. 

Rule number 3) If the building goes into lockdown, gather as many students as possible to your office and lock the door. If needed, use the emergency room and sit tight. Your supervisor will come to get you within two days. There are phones in there that can reach the other counselors. The children have a different set of rules that they must follow in case they can’t reach you. 

Rule number 4) The offsite cabins are never to be used or explored. 

Rule number 5) We only offer this camp for kids 12-17 and rarely is anyone 12 or younger. If anyone younger than 12 appears, notify your supervisor and do not interact with them. 

Rule number 6) Wayne oversees the fire tower; do not call him unless there is an emergency. His number is attached below. 

Rule number 7) If the containment units fill up please call this number: REDACTED 

Rule number 8) If anyone comes to you and tells you they saw God, lock them in a containment unit and do not go back to retrieve them. They have been marked and can’t be saved. 

Rule number 9) Do not be surprised if any of the kids here exhibit abilities that appear to be otherworldly. We have staff to handle this and they are welcome to stay here. 

Rule number 10) Creatures, objects, or buildings that set off the PAP (see page 8) must be marked by a red ribbon. If you can not mark a creature you must keep your eyes on it until the collection team arrives. 

Rule number 11) You are the last line of defense for Mercy Hollows. It is your job to make sure these kids are safe, and fed, and to ensure their mental wellbeing is taken care of. Do whatever means necessary to complete your job, even if it is not listed on these pages. 

Rule number 12) If a bus from LittleBrooke High School arrives, lock down the school and ready your service weapon. 

Rule number 13) If a bus from Greenridge High School arrives, lock down the school and ready your service weapon. 

13 A) There is a list at the back of the book of locations that function similarly to the ones listed in rules 12 and 13. Read the list and memorize it. 

These are the rules that should be remembered at all times. Throughout the chapters in this handbook, you will find other ones; do not worry about losing this handbook. It will always find its way back to you.

As I shut the book a wave of emotions washed over me, I barely had time to process before the door to my office flew open. A blond woman wearing a Mercy Hollows baseball cap met my eyes.

“Do you have your service weapon?” The woman asked me. 

“What’s your name?” I asked as I slid out of my chair as fast as possible. 

“Laura.” She said as she moved her eyes to examine me. I had no frame of reference for what she was supposed to look like and was concerned that I was being tricked. I mean, if the rules were to be believed, that was a very real, possibility. 

“I uh-” I stammered, but before she could answer me a loud screech rang through the hallway. 

“HIDE!” Laura snapped and rushed at me. She took me by my wrist and we slid under the desk. 

“What-” I went to ask what was going on, but she moved her hand up to cover my mouth. 

As we sat there, I could feel my body start shaking. I kept my eyes trained on the window in front of us. Slowly, a pair of large red eyes appeared in the glass. I could feel my eyes widen before we heard it speak. 

“Hello?” the creature asked. It sounded like it was speaking through an old phone. 

We could hear it walking around; it sounded wet. I could hear its feet hitting the floor with a loud FLOP; it sounded like peeling deli meat apart. 

“Hello?” the creature asked again before its head suddenly appeared in front of us. I have never screamed so loud; its head looked to be composed of a starfish and an octopus merged. Its eyes were huge, black, and bulbous. 

Laura shrieked and kicked the creature in its eye, causing it to roar and move away; at that moment, we both slid out from under the desk and my eyes darted around the room. I could see Laura slide a golden dagger out of her pocket, but I didn’t have anything. 

The creature had the body of a bloated human, I could see its skin sticking to the floor. 

“I already called the containment team,” Laura told me as she braced herself. 

In a flash, the creature darted at us; I was sure it could go to Laura first, so I moved to intercept its charge. I was hoping that I could grab it and she could stab it. I could hear my heart pounding, threatening to burst through my chest. As I got closer to the creature, my brain started burning, my vision became blurry, and I felt my body collide with the creature. 

It slammed me to the ground with enough force to force me to cry out. Its touch was molten, I felt its hand burning me under my shirt, like scalding hot water. I saw my life flashing before my eyes, and as the creature opened its mouth, it shrieked. As it stumbled back, I could see Laura's dagger sticking out of the side of the creature.

She took me by my arm, and I scrambled to my feet. Three men wearing what looked like SWAT team uniforms came charging down the hallway. I could hear their boots hitting the ground and when they appeared in the doorway, one of the men shot the creature in the back. I could see sparks flying off of the creature and before long, it fell forward. The men took the creature and dragged it into the hallway.

I was trying to catch my breath as Laura spoke to me, “You have to summon your service weapon.” She said as she put a hand on my shoulder. It felt like I couldn’t breathe. 

“Kids come here?” I managed to spit out as Laura was telling me that she would call a medic. 

“Yes. Welcome to Mercy Hollows.” Laura said [seriously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/).
