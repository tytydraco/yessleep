It was spring break, and three of my closest friends and I were going on a road trip. Jason, a red-headed oddball who I've known since I was five years old and never quite managed to shake off, organized the whole thing. He found an ad, advertising an RV return gig. A small company that rented them out had one left in a lot on the east coast, and needed it to be driven back to the main showroom in Montana. With a few clauses, this meant that not only were we getting it for a week for free, but we were also getting paid for the trouble. Or, at least, Jason was. At a push, the amount he was receiving would just about cover fuel, food and alcohol, with a little extra thrown in from the rest of us. 

Jason invited me, of course, Julian, a close enough acquaintance who'd recently come out of a long term relationship and was trying to start a songwriting career off the back of it, and Austin. Austin had only recently shaken off the nickname “Frodo”, which had stuck to his 5’3 stature all the way through highschool. As much as we made fun of him, Austin was a great guy, one of the nicest people I know. With nothing better going on in any of our lives, we all happily agreed to Jason's proposal. With four days' notice, I packed a week's worth of clothes into a duffel bag and dropped my dog, Boxer, and my Elephant Ear Plant off at my girlfriend's apartment. My girlfriend, Kate, lives with two roommates, one of which apparently is deathly allergic to dog hair. I pretended not to hear her as I turned to leave. We said our goodbyes in the hallway, and parted ways for the next week or so. 

We decided to convene in a shopping mall parking lot, which was near enough for all four of us. I was the first to arrive, and couldn't stop myself from laughing as I walked up to the RV that would be my home for the next week. One of the windows had shattered, and was replaced with a black trash bag duct taped to the seams. It hadn't been cleaned from the last renter's use, and was covered in mud that darkened the white-beige paint job. The panel door swung open and Jason stood there in a bathrobe.

“Welcome to the mothership!” He roared. 

“Nice robe” I said as I shrugged past him and into the van. I threw my bag onto one of the two beds, claiming it as my own. 

“Thanks, I found it on the bathroom floor” He informed me, gesturing towards the closet that was, apparently, where the toilet stood. I looked at him, and could tell he wasn't joking. 

We sat and talked about his grand ideas for the trip while we waited for the other two to turn up. As we did, he unfolded a comically large map of the contiguous United States, and laid it out on the tiny folding table. Red pen marked our route from Wilmington to Bozeman, cutting mainly through the Appalachian mountains before heading abruptly north.

“It's going to average out at around five hours of driving a day” He told me, chewing on his pen. 

“Should we go in shifts or…?” I asked, leaving the question open-ended. 

At that, Jason waved his hand in front of me dismissively. 

“No need, I'll be driving” He said. 

“Are you sure?” I responded. 

“Totally,” he continued, “It's the best seat in the house. Besides, Austin still doesn't have his licence and I couldn't put up with Julian complaining about cramps for hours on end.”

We laughed, and almost on cue the door swung open. Austin and Julian entered in a mock three stooges sketch and said their hellos. Jason informed them of the sleeping arrangements, giving Julian the pull-out seating and directing Austin to the floor. After a while, we'd all settled in and Jason slid behind the wheel. He pulled out of the parking lot and onto the open road, determined to cross state lines before midnight. 

The three of us not shackled to the wheel spent the rest of the evening drinking and playing cards. Julian was halfway through explaining the rules to a card game neither of us had heard before when Jason pulled into a small diner and parked up. We all bundled out of the winnebago and crowded into the small diner, which wore its Americana charm on its sleeve. We ate well and paid, and as we left Jason beckoned me over to him. He handed me an old polaroid camera from his bag and told me to take his picture next to the dented “Welcome to Tennessee” sign.

“Are you gonna do this with every state?” I asked him as I took the photo. 

“Absolutely!” He replied, grinning and holding onto the metal pole the sign stood on like his life depended on it. We took another photo, this time he posed with his thumbs up, before boarding the RV. He drove a little further until we found a place to park up for the night. By this point, three out of the four of us were hammered. As we got ready to sleep, Austin kept repeating the word “Winnebago” in a shitty British accent, making a pop culture reference too obscure for any of us to get, drunk or sober. Austin then collapsed onto his makeshift bed of a blow-up mattress, supplied by Jason, on the RV floor. He was positioned right outside the toilet, which I made a formal prediction would come back to bite him at some point. It did, and I was awoken into our second day on the road by the sounds of bird song the howls of Austin as Julian accidentally stood on him. 

Today, Jason wanted to see if we could come across some classic roadside attractions. I offered to Google if any were close, but he assured me that it'd be more fun to stop randomly at any we find naturally. Once we finished cooking up camp stove bacon and eggs for breakfast, Jason started driving. We had an hour of playing music and having a good time until the RV started to slow. I looked out the window to see a white, wooden house jutting in from the treeline. A sign over the door read “Aunt Theresa's Chandlery”. We abandoned the camper where it was and all of us, bar Julian, wandered up to the little shop's front door. It opened with a small bell's ring and we found ourselves surrounded by dripping wax and the smell of herbs. The place had a homely, but new-aged feel to it, and I had to keep vigilant so as not to step on one of the cats that swarmed the room. 

Jason combed inquisitively through the wide selection of candles on sale, while Austin tried to nurse his sudden headache. Just then, the beaded curtain that separated the first room from the next parted, and in walked a young African-American girl, maybe mid to late teens. She had frizzy hair tied back, thick braces and a purple cardigan. 

“Oh, hi!” she squeaked, chewing gum. 

“Hey”, I replied and picked up a hexagonal green-blue candle, “could I buy this?”

“Sure,” she said, “follow me.”

I followed her through the waterfall of beads and into a small front room. She ducked behind the counter in the corner and worked the register. The candle was eighteen bucks, and I realised why they didn't have price tags on anything shortly after buying it. The three of us thanked her and left the store.

“Charming” Said Jason, camera hanging around his neck.

“Eighteen bucks of candle?” I blurted out, holding the candle in my hands and studying it. “Is that normal or overpriced? I've never bought scented candles before, I can't tell.”

This conversation continued all the way back to the RV and half way down the road. The rest of the day was spent looking out for more roadside attractions. By dusk, we'd seen a twenty-foot tall fiberglass chicken, which claimed to be the biggest in the state. If that wasn't enough, we stumbled across a gimmicky museum dedicated to salt and pepper shakers, as well as a plaque for a freak show performer known as the eyeball kid, who was apparently born without a body, whatever that meant. Jason had pictures of them all, and seemed possessed by a child-like wonder whenever we spotted something out of the ordinary. 

We joined up onto the interstate and drove north, passing through Virginia before heading up into the mountainous roads of West Virginia. It was pitch black outside at this point and with our stomachs full of fast food, we found a semi-safe looking area to park up at for the night, which we half hoped, half guessed wasn't on private land.  We hadn't been shot at come dawn, so I assumed we guessed correctly. After a breakfast of leftovers and loose fruit, we started driving again. Julian was laying on my bed at the back of the RV, jotting away in a notebook. Austin and I were playing checkers. Jason, as always, was planted firmly behind the wheel. 

We were driving through a pretty forested, unexceptional rural backwater when it happened. I subconsciously felt the winnebago slow, and noticed as we came to a stop. I glanced out the small window to my left and saw only woodland. Jason undid his belt and slid out of the driver's seat. I watched him as he wordlessly opened the side door and stepped out. I looked back at Austin who just shrugged. We both moved from our cramped seats and followed Jason outside to see what had gotten his attention. We walked to his side, where he was standing, squinting in the sun. A few yards in front of us was the ocean. 

The asphalt road petered out into a beige gradient where it met the sand bank. There was a narrow beach, running as far as I could see in either direction. Beyond it was a vast open sea, with no hint of land on the horizon. I saw waves lap at the shore, but they made no sound. It was like a mirror, reflecting the blue of the sky. The three of us silently stood where we were, taking in the impossible sight. 

“Hey guys, why did we… holy fuck!” Julian muttered as he crept up behind us. 

I saw the trees around us on either side of the road stop abruptly where they met the sand line, like the forest had been cut surgically in half. Our confused group cautiously made their way onto the sandy beach, kicking at it as if to prove its existence. 

“Is this a lake?” Asked Austin. 

“There wasn't one marked on the map,” replied Jason as he crouched down by the waterside and looked out at its endless horizon, “and I don't think they could miss something like this.”

He dipped his hand into the water before bringing it to his nose. I watched in disgust as he brought it down to his mouth, stuck out his tongue and tasted it. 

“Salt,” He said, spitting onto the asphalt, “it's sea water.”

“It's not fucking sea water,” laughed Julian, “it can't be! That makes no sense. None. Anyway, salt water lakes are a thing, right?”

While the two of them argued, and Austin dug around in the sand with his index finger, I stood and stared. Muttering under my breath, almost to myself, I said “strange how the road just… stops.”

It was some time before we saw it. Julian had gone back onto the RV, but the rest of us refused to move on. Jason, Austin and I wanted to explore the beach further and, eventually, enticed Julian out. The four of us made our way down the strip that ran parallel to the treeline. The beach was populated by the occasional shell, smooth stone or hunk of driftwood. Just after I took Jason's picture, and we decided to head back, a small blur appeared on the ocean’s rim. Austin spotted it first, and we all stopped to look. The blur reflected the sunlight at odd angles, and looked to be drawing nearer. It wasn't that long before we came to the sudden and mutual understanding that it was a boat. 

The boat, which we were now following intently, was coming to shore, and strafing to the right as it did. Our little group kept pace with it, walking what felt like the entire length of the beach. Soon, the boat was near enough to make out the individual ropes and pulleys. I'd only ever been sailing once, and was far from familiar with any nautical terminologies, so pardon me if I make any mistakes. 

As we turned a bend in the shoreline we came across a rickety looking wooden pier that continued out maybe twenty yards into the sea. The white paint that covered the panels had all but flaked off, and the many posts were covered in old rope. Despite Jason's enthusiasm, we didn't walk onto the pier until we saw the sailing boat drift elegantly and stop at the end of the dock. Before any of us could say anything, Jason clambered onto the pier and strutted towards the now still ship. 

First, we called out to anyone who might be in the boat. When we got no reply back, we decided it was safe to explore. Jason was the first on as he eagerly climbed over the ship's railing and onto the deck. Once we made sure that the boat was tied securely to the dock with the thickest length of rope I'd ever seen, we followed him in on. The ship was a medium sized sailboat, clearly abandoned and left to drift. Still, it wasn't in that bad of a condition. The rigging seemed to be intact and the wooden floor seemed subject to only minor weathering. While me and Austin were snooping around the top deck, we heard Julian call us from down below. 

We passed down the hatch way and into the cramped lounge and sleeping quarters. Julian and Jason were slouched over the table, on which was a plate of half eaten roast chicken and steamed greens, next to a lukewarm cup of coffee. 

“This is so weird!’ Mumbled Jason to himself, with a tone of wonder and amazement. 

“Right, I'm going back to the RV” Julian said with a sigh and shrugged past us. 

Austin and I stood next to Jason, and prodded the food with the same shared amazement. Our moment was shattered by Julian's scream. We sounded like a wounded animal and the three of us rushed up to the top deck to see what had happened. As soon as I did, I stopped and looked around. There was no land anywhere in sight. None. I turned to my friends and saw the same terrifying realisation plastered on their faces. Surrounding us, from the boat to the horizon, was open water. 

“We… we must've got loose… drifted” Jason began to reason with himself. 

This was two weeks ago. The four of us have been drifting since. We've never seen land, felt hunger and we just can't settle on how long it's been. For me, at least, we've been drifting for two weeks. Austin commits to the idea that we've only been on the boat for a few hours, and still busies himself trying to find a way off. Maybe he's right, since my phone, the way I'm getting this message out to you all, still has plenty of juice. Jason sides with me, saying that we've only been here for a few weeks, a month tops. But Julian… Julian now sits in the narrow corner of the cabin. He doesn't move, doesn't speak, but in his glassy eyes I can see the despair of years. 

Please. I have no idea how you can help us, but you must. You must. If you ever find the ocean where it shouldn't be, then you've found us. Please, come searching. You're our only hope.
