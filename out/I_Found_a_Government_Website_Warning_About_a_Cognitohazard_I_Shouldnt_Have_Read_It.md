I have no idea how I ended up there. One second I was bouncing between Wikipedia rabbit holes, and the next, I was staring at a government site that didn’t seem to exist.

 

The URL was just a string of numbers: http://173.82.41.6/internal/osc-2025/cognition-alert. No .gov, no agency logo. Just a plain black background and bright red text blinking at the top:

 

WARNING: CLASS-3 COGNITIVE THREAT DETECTED. DO NOT READ FURTHER.

 

That would’ve been the point where any normal person clicks out, right? But the thing is, the page wasn’t open in my browser. It replaced whatever tab I had open before. I didn’t click a link. I didn’t type anything. It just appeared.

 

I told myself it was probably a prank. Some weird ARG. Maybe a hacker screwing with people using browser exploits. So I kept scrolling.

 

Below the warning was a dated message:

 

OSC-7 Directive (Issued: May 2, 2025, 03:41 EST)

A memetic hazard capable of inducing rapid psychogenic collapse has been identified in the continental United States. Primary vectors include:

– Visual glyphs (see attached image – REDACTED)

– Auditory sequences (see MP3 – REDACTED)

– Descriptive language.

 

The cognitohazard is considered linguistically self-propagating. Exposure to ANY description, symbolic representation, or paraphrasing may result in contamination.

 

If you are reading this and have not undergone OSC inoculation, cease immediately and report your exposure to 1-866-███-████.

 

There was more. But I swear, the second I read the word “self-propagating,” something hummed behind my eyes.

 

It wasn’t a sound. Not really. More like when you get a high fever and your thoughts turn syrupy. I scrolled down instinctively, like I was being pulled, even though every cell in my body screamed to stop.

 

The page kept updating in real-time, like a live incident feed. Users flagged in real-time. IPs blacklisted. Cities marked in red with ominous tags: “contaminated zone,” “silent mass casualty,” “containment failed.”

 

I should’ve stopped.

 

But then I saw my ZIP code on the list. Timestamped six minutes earlier.

 

At the bottom of the page, a block of code started printing itself:

\> INITIATING PROTOCOL ██-██ 

\> TRACE COMPLETE 

\> USER LOGGED – NO INOCULATION DETECTED 

\> SYNTACTIC EXPOSURE LEVEL: 91% 

\> SYMPTOM ONSET IN: 03:12

It counted down.

 

Three minutes.

 

I panicked. I tried shutting down my PC, but it wouldn’t power off. The screen flickered, flashing between the site and a strange symbol — like a spiral made of tiny red letters, all spelling a word I can’t remember, but feel like I never stopped hearing since.

 

I grabbed my phone. No signal. No Wi-Fi. Just a new notification from a system app I never installed:

 

\[Cognition Alert: Level 3\] You have been exposed. Help is no longer applicable. Accept the thought. Let it spread.

 

 

I don’t know how long I’ve been awake. I don’t think I’ve blinked. The spiral is burned into every surface now — the walls, my coffee mug, the whites of my eyes. And worse, I’ve started understanding it. Like it’s rewriting how I think, one word at a time.

 

If you've read this far, I’m sorry.

 

I tried to censor things, but I’m not sure it matters anymore.

The site’s gone now, of course. I tried to go back, and it just 404s.

 

But I think that was the point.

It just needed someone to read it.

To spread the seed.

To teach it how to get into your mind with less.

Just enough to keep growing.

 

If you feel something behind your eyes right now — a hum, a word you didn’t mean to think — it’s already too late.

 

I didn’t mean to pass it on.

 

I swear.
