in a weird twist of fate, or maybe rather the usual goings of my life when i get high or some shit, some unsettling shit happened today. I go out with my pup every night or so, around 12 and may sometimes be later when i get back home.

today, like all days, i wasted away the day and lazed about until it was almost too late to take out a dog on a walk. It was around a quarter to midnight, simmi and i started on our long walk around the neighborhood. i say around, but we mostly go north to a small field that used to be accessible around a month or so ago, and now has a massive gate smack dab on the edge of it. The situation had been building up over the months, but we had just taken a break on the midnight gallivants since it was time for simmi to follow the world's passions. Anyways, it must be over a month since we last went out. i did go out about a week ago for maybe 10 mins but it was too late and i just hurried back after i saw the damn gate. soured my mood mucho.

today was much the same at the start.

I got out, i started walking, took out my joint by the first turn, lit it up by the second. By the 6th turn, i was on dregs already(i've got a nifty paper size, just enough for a mild high). it was a long walk to get to the seventh turn, it would've been the turn into the aforementioned field about a month ago, this time it would just be me turning back around to home. On the way to the field, theres a small wooden cottage on a overgrown slope at the start of a line of houses. This land the cottage is on lies adjacent to a water supply office thingy. Basically there are tanks on the premises of the building that seem to perpetually leak water. Theres a tree that flowers a beautiful purple and white around the start of spring. and the building itself sports a tin roof.

Theres a sort of lore to this tin roof. It was a peculiar stop on the way to field, one, it had a blinding light mounted on the roof that happened to glare out into the road and the water tanks. you could see the tanks through the window when passing by diagonally through its front. the other peculiar thing was that sometimes things fell on this roof exactly as you passed by. and if you listened for a while, if the sound reappeared, it would be a good deal more aggressive about its thud. it was a creepy feeling if you let your mind wander, and so i used to keep the earbuds in during this part of the run. i forgot the buds tonight. i had a mind fueled by THC altered psychosis, and a thudding that was hard to describe other than targeted at the person disturbing whatever entity that lived either on the tree above this house, or on the tin roof itself. i scoff at the otherwordly, and describe myself as an atheist. A description of the divine is futile when no proof other than forceful poignancy is allowed. Maybe this description is flawed, but isn't humankind? what calls for a secret law binding the reality of just these conscious, perpetually in motion, machines of such incredible complexity that unraveling even parts of its workings would fault the existence of the divine as idiocy.

but that was a tangent. Too much of one. On this dear summery spring night, i heard repeated thuds after the first. These were frequent (a one-two) at times or just slow, deliberate putts. in my head, something walked on the roof, it searched about for the noise coming from the road, and glared at this creature that disturbed it at the peak of the night. i felt apologetic for whatever it was, while being panicked at the thought of something i could not see observing me from the anonimity of night. Remember the light that glared out into the road? i cannot see past the curtain it makes. and so i keep walking toward the field, my seventh turn. The numbering of the turns hold no meaning here, they are only a way for me to describe the length of time spent traversing this particular segment of the nightly excursion.

simmi ran in front, i kept walking. nearly at the field, i stopped and started push ups. these were traditionally a field exercise, but since it would be a hassle to ninja me and simmi over a six foot wall and come back, i started right on the road there. turning back, i remained high as shit and listening for all abnormalities. thats what high is like sometimes. in deep paranoia due to an insecurity of being observed in the dead of the night, i looked for reasons everywhere. by the time i passed the cottage, i was in my mind about all that happened during the day, it was just another night anyways. and Thud. i laughed. the chances that would happen. but it had stopped my meditative state, i was back on the prowl for shadows that did not belong in the nooks and crannies i squizzed at.

it was sort of fun by this time, like some exercise in non-belief. i kept up the pace, simmi walking in front. we'd be at the 6th turn almost, and simmi would turn back on the path we first took, while i keep walking. it was a nightly ritual, she sometimes came back and used another of the paths. she just didnt like the road since strays sometimes slept around farther forward. so off we went. the second house on the left after simmi left me for the diverging path, i heard something fall down the roof. it was unmistakably something striking stone or concrete. i kept walking, another of those coincidences. every other house after that, i think, above the loud, passionate barking of several large dogs, i heard something or other strike something i could imagine was the roof of these houses. i carried on, sounds in the night were just sounds. most foolish would be to check everytime you hear that shit and peer at corners making out shadows of benign objects. i did all these since i am paranoid. but im close to home, and home is safe. so i keep up, second to last turn, no more sounds, last turn, same thing, i get closer to where simmi always waits for me at the gate. Its brighter here these days, theres lights on on the gates, i see simmi clearly. I call out to simmi, and thud. some sound from the left. weird innit?

i get to the gates, call simmi in. shes awefully well behaved today. my lovely girl. i shelve the shoes, and get to my after walk stretching routine. i spend this time in athletic torpor as i try out calisthenics on the metal gate frame. a ten minute long contortive exercising, and i start back to my room. i stop in the kitchen to look for food to procure for late night hunger pangs(a habit of one such as myself a perpetuation of the drug cycle if you will). as i dance about in self congratuation, i hear the last movement of the night. a movement right above me. something fell on the roof above. at 12:30 am.
