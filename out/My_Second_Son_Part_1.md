I’m posting my story here because I need someone else to listen. I wrote this six years ago, and due to recent events regarding my son, I dug through my files to find this document. I reread the events that played out years ago, and now my memories are all that remain bouncing around in my brain. I feel as if posting this here will free these memories from my head, sending my worst moments deep into the void of the internet. Even if these words land on someone else’s ears in some strange coincidence, I don’t think I can bear to read the comments. I cannot bear to see my morality questioned by another person's mind. So here is to six years of regret:

The last normal day of my life is what I reflect upon most when I remember anything from then. That day was just as similar to the previous day as any other. I remember running through the woods, looking left and right as if something were chasing me. The trees in front of me were almost magically out of my path as I ran. I have no idea what I could have been running from, but I felt a steady anxiety, a pang in my chest. Eventually, I was stopped by something vibrantly glowing in front of me, something I only saw from the corner of my eye as I attempted to peer behind my running feet.

I looked forward and stopped immediately. It was a tree, a perfect, picturesque tree with a round frame, bright green leaves, and a strong body. The trunk was thick, but the top couldn't have been higher than thirty feet. I stopped and was enthralled by this story-like tree. It was not a calming feeling, but a feeling of rush, of excitement maybe, as I took a step forward to it. I looked at the lowest hanging branch and saw two apples. Two perfect apples bobbing delicately from the tree, asking to be picked. My heart beat faster as I closed in on the red-hanging fruit. I reached out to grab it, softly plucking it from the loose twig it held onto. I felt a sudden sensation of saliva filling my mouth. Never had I seen an apple this delicious, or any food for that matter.

I brought it to my mouth, sinking my incisors into the soft flesh of the fruit, expecting a sweet taste and a fragrant smell. Instead, I scrunched my nose up as my tongue retreated further into my mouth. It tasted bitter, acrid, on my tongue. I pulled it out of my mouth to see that the object I was holding was not an apple, but instead, a pomegranate. I spit the white flesh and purple-red seeds from my mouth onto the ground. The tiny pieces flecked off the hard earth when I heard a shrill screaming noise. “Scree! Scree! Scree!,” it repeated. I looked at the pomegranate I had just bitten and watched as the red juices flowing out of its wound spilled into my hand and down my arm. It was the revolting, sticky feeling of melted sugar, and that’s when I opened my eyes. I had been dreaming, and my alarm clock had been going berserk for the past five minutes.

I reached my hand over and smacked the top of the alarm. I moved my legs in bed to realize that I felt something warm and wet. I pulled the covers off of my body to see, for the first time since I was a child, I had wet the bed. I felt embarrassed and disgusted with myself. "How could I let something so stupid and childish happen?" I thought. I jumped out of bed and headed straight for the shower. I was going to take one anyway, I guess. 

After brushing my teeth, starting my coffee, and other than the whole “accident” I had earlier, I had an otherwise stereotypical morning. I went to Danny’s room, waking him up, and congratulating him on not wetting the bed tonight, unlike his mother. We both ate breakfast, some cheap waffle meal I had thrown into the microwave, although he acted like I was a five-star chef. Other times, to him, I was some hoodlum they had brought off the street for help in the kitchen; my food usually ended up on the floor and promptly into the trash.

I put on my first uniform and grabbed my second uniform from the dryer, putting it into the car. I helped Danny comb his hair, although he fussed and wanted to move his head around like a chicken pecking at ants. I even thought of offering that he could comb my hair, but the last time we tried that, he found a knot at the end of my hair and nearly scalped me with one strong rip of the brush. We did everything together in the morning.

I rushed him out to the car and put him into his car seat in the back and strapped him in with little resistance that morning. I got into the front seat, turned the car on, and, while normally we would listen to music, I felt like talking to someone this morning. 

“Danny.” His head shot up from wherever he was ambiently staring, surely falling asleep, as he started his stare at me.

“Yes, mama?” He said in his now, mostly intelligible, yet sleepy voice.

“Do you like going to Beth’s?” I asked, thinking of anything to say that would pertain to his consciousness.

“Yes,” he said with an extended “sss” noise before pausing and adding more to his childish statement.

“I like yours more.”

I remember feeling somewhat saddened by his statement. I knew he liked to be at our house more, even though he spent most of his days at his babysitter’s. We remained in silence, stopping to turn as I felt the deafening, beating silence of the turn signal clicking, like a clock counting the seconds down of... something. I piped up, feeling awkward myself; he did not care.

“I’ll get to see you Sunday,” I said in a cheery voice and gave him a toothful smile in the mirror. He didn’t return any of the same emotion and started up his voice again, monotone.

“How long is Sunday?” I froze up, and I started to fumble my words.

“It’s… a few days…” He replied with one word.

“Long.”

I dropped him off at Beth’s and thanked her. Usually, I would have stayed longer, but that day, I felt my words should be short. I drove off to work, my first job of the day. I worked two jobs at the time. My first shift job was at a local diner. I had known the family for quite some time, and they offered me a job after they learned my husband had left me with Danny. The job was easy, and I picked it up quickly: washing dishes, waiting tables, food prep, and the occasional unruly bathroom cleaning. Fortunately, there wasn’t any of the latter that day, just a regular workday with regular people and below regular pay. That’s why I got a second job.

My second shift was spent in a wholly unruly gas station that could never stay clean. While it wasn’t the hardest job, it usually left me beat after spending all night selling customers our new deals and new items in between cooking, cleaning, stocking, and whatever else was on my list. There was one good thing about this job, though: I had made a friend.

I usually stuck to myself and stayed quiet, but one woman couldn’t help but talk to me. Her name was Tiffany, but most just called her Tiff. She was about 40 or 50, I couldn’t tell. It seems like gas stations have a severe effect on your physical and mental health in some way. She appeared quite brutish and could come off that way to unsuspecting customers. She was one of the few people who looked after me, though, mostly because her husband cheated on her with three different women over two years, and she just loved to tell that story. She had a rather complicated fiery hatred for men. 

Whenever I wasn’t talking to a customer, I was talking to her. It made my day go by faster, and it felt good to use my mouth for something other than useless store propaganda and jargon. Her favorite thing to talk about was Danny, though. She loved to see any picture of him, and any mention of him had her ears perked up like a cropped Doberman. I don’t think she had ever even met him before, but I think she just missed her children who didn’t speak to her. Most of the day went by slowly, other than some teenage kid who didn’t know how to use the gas pump and ended up with gasoline covering half the parking lot when it fell out of his tank.

As my night was coming to an end, Tiff called me outside to “take a break.” I walked outside and felt the cool, fresh summer night air as the streetlights cast a green overlay on the side of the brick building. I leaned back against the wall, next to the trash can as Tiff did the same while she lit up a cigarette.

“So, you got any plans for your future?” she said, the cigarette hanging from her lip, before she used two fingers to pull it to the middle, sucking in the chemicals and letting out a big burst of smoke, fanning it away with her hand. I stood for a while, just thinking before responding.

“No. Not really,” I answered truthfully.

“You’re still young, you can make it. You ever thought about headin’ back to school?” she said before letting out another big puff.

“Don’t have time. I have Danny,” I said, still looking up at the green-tinted black sky.

“You ever gonna move out of that dump you live in?” I was taken aback at her harsh words before rationalizing them in my head as “This is a woman who’s spent her whole life working in a gas station.” I knew my house wasn’t very nice, but I couldn’t afford anything more, and rarely did I have the time to clean or mow the lawn.

“I’ve looked. It’s about the cheapest there is. I can’t go much higher than that.”

“Ever thought of getting a better job?” she answered with a rebuttal.

“I’ve looked there too. Most places I see need some sort of license or pay close to minimum wage.” 

“Gas station ain’t gonna cut it. I could help look for you. I think I could get some connections,” she said, lending out a metaphorical hand.

“I… I think I’m alright,” I replied, shooing that said hand away. She finished her cigarette and scrunched it up against the wall, making a black smudge, before throwing it on the sidewalk, and turning to face me.

“Girl, you need help. And I know it's just gonna get worse. Wait til you get knocked up by some other man and got two kids on your hands. Then what’re you gonna do?” she said, more enthusiastically, presumably getting fired up about her own life. I stopped staring up at the sky and faced her.

“I’m not gonna go and do something like that. I don’t think I need a relationship right now. I just... need Danny and that’s it.” Her ears perked up at the mention of my son.

“That’s the right thinking.” She looked at the clock through the window of the gas station, mouthing “ten o’clock” before looking at me and smiling. 

“Looks like it's your time to go.” I looked up at the clock and looked back at her.

“Seems so.”

I clocked out of work and told her my goodbyes, walking out to my car. I headed back to Beth’s to pick up Danny. I felt supremely tired on this drive and found myself shutting my eyes on more than one occasion. I reached her house and pulled into the driveway, Beth already standing on the porch holding Danny’s little hand as he rubbed his eye with the other. He looked like he had just woken up and was more than a little grumpy. I got out of the car and walked up to the porch, giving a friendly wave at them. Beth gave a warm smile and a full wave. Danny gave a frowny face and a half-hearted effortless wave with a hand that never left his body.

“Are you ready to go home?” I said enthusiastically, even though I felt entirely exhausted.

“Yeah,” he replied before yawning and stretching. Beth and I shared smiles unbeknownst to him.

“Come on, let's get you home then,” I said, taking his eye-rubbing hand with two of my fingers and leading him down the steep porch stairs and into the running car. I lifted him to his seat and buckled him in, his tired eyes shutting over and over before finally his head slumped over by the end of the process. I smiled at him and quietly shut the door, walking back up the porch to talk to Beth.

“So, how was he today?” I said once I finally reached the porch.

“Rotten as always.”

“Did he eat his food?"

“He was a bit skeptical, but he ended up eating it once he tasted it. He was pretty good today. We watched cartoons and colored. I’m sure he’ll tell you all about it tomorrow." She raised her hand and moved them out, vaguely referencing something big in a childlike way, before her face fell and became more unhappy.

"Well... during his nap he did have a bad dream, but he got over it pretty quickly.”

“Aw. Was it the big bumblebee coming to sting him again?” Her face lit up again, probably thinking of the number of times they had dealt with the same situation.

“No, not this time. He woke up crying and had peed all over himself. He said something about ‘getting eaten.’ Maybe he just didn’t like the food I made that much.” I stopped and thought for a moment. That was weird. 

“Didn’t know he was having some sort of cannibal dream. You haven’t let him watch any scary movies, have you?” 

“No. Course not. Just cartoons.”

“He used to watch cartoons all the time with his dad,” I said a bit hesitant, still a fresh wound. I made a cringing face after that comment, and there was a long pause, interrupted by the tapping of Beth’s fingers on the wooden post of the porch. A sudden cold gust of wind ran through the beams, straight through my body.

“So… you hear about him?” she said, trying to rip off the Band-aid of a still-bleeding cut. I sighed.

“Yeah… I heard.”

“Prison… didn’t think he was one for drugs.” Another long pause before she started speaking again, the wailing of windchimes next to us as the wind picked up.

“Where are you gonna send Danny this summer? Thought you were gonna become a CNA?”

“I… don’t know. It just happened so fast, I haven’t really had time to think about it… I’m sorry.” I looked down at my feet, as did she, feeling the back of my throat burn and tears well up, but I managed to force them down. A rather strong gust of wind came through and whistled through the houses and leaves of the trees, leaving me frigid. I turned to look at the sky and saw gray clouds brewing in the distance of the black sky.

“Didn’t think it was supposed to storm tonight? Weather channel said clear skies for the next week,” she said from behind me.

“That is weird,” I said in an emotionless and slow voice, mesmerized by the swirls of the clouds and the winds. I twisted my body back to face her and put on a fake smile.

“I best get to leaving. I'll see you in the morning.”

“Bye, Tori,” she said as she looked at me and waved, before turning back and heading into the house as I hurried to the car. I got in and looked at the backseat, he was still sound asleep. I started the short drive back to our house, or as Danny had called it, “your house.” The sky was turning significantly darker, darker than black. I was surprised it hadn’t started raining yet.

I got home and parked the car, getting out to quietly bring my softly sleeping son inside. I carried him in my arms when I felt a raindrop on my head. I leered up at the sky and then down at Danny. A fat raindrop fell from the sky and landed directly on his forehead. His nose scrunched up, but otherwise, he remained calmly asleep. I got him inside and laid him on his bed, taking his shoes off and pulling the covers over him. My pursed lips met his forehead, right where that misplaced raindrop had landed. He didn’t open his eyes. He didn’t make a noise. He didn’t move an inch. I was done for the day.

The rain had started pouring down in monsoon levels. The windows had become a blurry mess of moving images behind a wall of white. Thunder could be heard, quite distant, but coming closer. It was the type of atmosphere that seemed perfect for getting a good night's sleep. I slipped off my gas station uniform and got into my pajamas, the ones that hadn’t been soaked the prior night. I climbed into bed, more so crawled. I was exhausted and that day had been terribly long. I pulled the covers over myself and turned onto my side. I grabbed the other pillow from the headboard and held the soft object tightly in my arms.

I lay there for a while, before opening my eyes and looking at the other side of the bed. It was perfectly flat; mine had a dent in it. This was enough to make me cry. I held onto the pillows tightly and buried my face into them. I remember thinking “Why did he have to be so stupid? Why can’t he be here now? Why can’t he raise his son? Why doesn't he think I'm attractive anymore?” I cried and cried and cried, softly whimpering into the pillows, trying not to be loud, when I heard a sudden crash. I pulled my head up, shocked, thinking Danny had fallen out of his bed, before realizing the noise was just the loud boom of thunder. It frightened me enough to stop crying. I turned to lay on my back and tried to go to sleep for real that time. It worked.

I had another dream that night. This time, I was in the same woods, but it was much darker. It was night and I wasn’t running. I remembered the tree from the dream before, although I usually can’t think about much of anything in dreams. I walked until I found that tree again. It had lost all its light, and the pomegranate I had picked off of it had lain on the earth. I looked up at the other pomegranate on the tree and moved up to it. The fruit was shriveled and twisted. I moved my hand up to it and inspected the fetid object. It was definitely an apple, no doubt about it. I looked around for other fruit on the tree, but those were the only two. I didn’t dare pick the only apple left. Instead, I turned around when I felt something brush up against my back. Something warm and small.

I gasped as my eyes opened like I had just surfaced from the bottom of the ocean. I hadn’t wet the bed this time, but I felt I may have been close. I still felt that warm feeling on my back before it moved. I lurched my back and quickly turned over, pushing myself off the bed and standing. I was on high alert. I thought maybe a mouse had gotten into my bed, but it was too big. A stray cat couldn’t have gotten in, but then I saw what it was. It was Danny. He lay curled up, right where I was, looking at me with bewildered eyes.

“What wrong, Mama?” he said with a confused tone. I breathed a sigh of relief and brought my hand to my chest, feeling how hard my heart was beating. I gently sat down on the bed next to him.

“Bad dream. I’m okay now.”

“The bumblebee?” he asked in an almost scared voice, making me smile and exhale through my nose.

“No, not the bumblebee one. Different people have different dreams.”

“The apple one?”

My blood ran cold. I stared at him for a while with wide eyes and deep breaths. I had to rationalize it in my head. He was learning. One of the first items he learned about was an apple. Yes, A is for Apple. He couldn’t have known, but I remembered the dream that Beth had told me. I needed to stop thinking.

I climbed back into bed and looked at him hesitantly, he was already dozing off again. I slowly wrapped my arms around him, as I did the pillow from before. I held him tightly, not letting go as he slept in my arms. After what seemed like hours, I fell back asleep. No dreams this time.

It was the last normal day of my life.

I heard the loud shrill of the alarm “Scree! Scree! Scree!” before I slipped my arm out from under Danny and turned the alarm off. He lay in bed soundly asleep as I got up and started my morning. I showered, started my coffee, and started breakfast. I returned to my bed to wake Danny up and bring him to his room to get him dressed and ready for the day. I rustled him until he swatted his arm out like a brave little three-year-old. I rustled him some more until he fully woke up.

“Danny, get up. You gotta go to Beth’s.”

“No. I’m seepy.”

“Come on, get up.”

He groaned and turned onto his side. I got a playful spark of idea. I ran my finger up his side and started tickling his armpit. He started giggling and screamed “Stop, stop, stop!” before I finally did stop. I looked at him laughing. I hadn’t laughed in a while. He seemed to be the only one who could make me laugh.

“You gonna get up now?” He gave his best grumpy face before I pulled him along, he followed reluctantly, afraid of the tickle monster. I brought him to his room, thinking about how he had to have made the same trip the night before. He had never come to sleep in my bed, but since he had graduated from a crib, I guess he could have. I couldn't help to wonder why. Maybe it was a bad dream. I held his hand and pulled him along behind me, as he was rubbing his eyes again. I opened his bedroom door and turned on his light, turning back to look at him.

“What do you want to wear today?” I said cheerfully before turning back and stopping.

My whole body froze.

In his bed, I saw a mass under the pillows. It scared me at first before I realized those must be his stuffed animals all bundled up under his blanket in a perfectly Danny-shaped form. That’s what I told myself, but I felt something bad. My hair stood on end as I slowly walked towards the bed, letting go of Danny’s hand, leaving him at the doorframe as my heart beat faster and faster. I slowly inched forward, thinking about how I was going to pull off the blanket like a Band-aid, fast and quick. 

*There’s just a dinosaur under there. Just a big ol’ mean dinosaur, Tori. That’s it. Just pull it off. Nothing to be scared of. Maybe even a big bumblebee.*

I stood over the bed and put my arms out, ready to pull the blanket off at any moment, but I couldn’t. That's when Danny piped up from the doorway.

“Mama?” he asked questioningly before I heard something beneath me. I looked down to see rustling in the bed. My heart sank. I thought I was dead. I didn’t know what to do. That’s when a little grubby arm popped out from under the blanket. I didn’t scream like they do in horror movies. I was just frozen, unable to breathe or move. The arm kept moving back and forth, wriggling around and bumping the stuffed animals off of the bed to my feet. The monster revealed itself more and more until the covers came completely off. It was Danny. I stared in bewilderment, looking down at the young thing in my son’s bed as it rubbed its eyes. I turned around to look at the doorway. Danny was there too, standing patiently, rubbing his eyes. The boy in the bed looked up at me.

“What wrong, Mama?”

I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. How could I have two sons? Two of the same son? Maybe one of them was a different boy I picked up from Beth's. Maybe one of them was a kid from the street who just happened to look, sound, and talk like Danny. Maybe one of them was some sort of monster… but monsters aren’t real. The two boys stood across from each other, paying no attention to one another, only to me. I thought maybe only one of them would know only what Danny could know.

“Hey… Danny?” I said slowly through a shuddering breath.

“Yes, Mama,” both of them said in perfect unison. Perfect. Not a pitch different. I started shivering.

“What’s your favorite color?”

“Bwue,” they both said at the exact same time, the same impediment, the same everything.

“How old are you?” I said, asking another simple question. Both of them giggled, it was the same giggle, the same peaks, the same chortle. 

“That’s silly, Mama. I’m Thwee,” they said in undeniable synchrony. They had to be the same. There was no difference, so I asked them the one thing that had been different.

“Where did you sleep last night?” I asked shakily.

“Mama bed.”

 “My bed.”

Both of them stopped looking at me and stared directly at each other, eyes glazed over and nothing was spoken. They stared for a while, the first time acknowledging each other before they both looked at me again.

“I’m hungry,” they both said when the one in the bed started to get up and walk towards me. I moved backward, pressing up against the corner as he moved closer. He stopped before he reached me.

“Where did you sleep the day before?” I spurted out.

“My bed,” they both replied, the other one’s little head poking around the corner of the doorway. They looked like two little aliens, slowly marching forward. I started to think. Maybe they can’t be in the same place at once. Maybe that’s why he came to sleep in my bed. I extended my finger and pointed toward the opposite corner of the room.

“Go stand in that corner, Danny.”

“Why, Mama?” they said.

“Because I said so," I stated authoritatively. They both walked over to the corner, standing side-by-side, not touching.

“Stand in the middle.”

“I can’t.”

“Why not?”

“I just can’t,” they said, acting like nothing was wrong. I slowly inched toward them, deeming them not to be a threat at the moment. At least one of them was my son. I decided to confront them directly.

“Do you see the boy standing next to you?” They giggled again.

“What you mean?”

“The boy standing right next to you that looks exactly like you.” They laughed even harder, probably finding it absurd. They turned and looked right at each other, their gazes passing through each other as their eyes darted around. I reached my arms out and snatched both of them by their little rubbery wrists. I started to pull them next to each other, trying to force them to touch. I angrily started yelling.

“Do you not see the boy!...” Their hands touched. Both of them fell to the ground and started screaming louder than I’d ever heard him scream before. The only other time that comes close was when he accidentally stepped on a piece of glass. They were screaming like they were being killed. They pushed themselves backward across the rooms, screaming and crying, trying to get as far away from me as possible.

“I hate you, Mama! I hate you! I hate you!” They both screamed as I covered my ears from the double assault. I ran out of the room, slamming the door shut behind me. I ran out into the hallway, out into the living room, and up against the front door. I was out of breath and placed up against the door, looking back terrified, waiting for them to come running at me. They didn't run, and they didn't come for me.

What was it in my son's room? I didn’t understand, and I don’t want to know. I sat against the door, trying to catch my breath when my phone began to buzz in my pocket. I fumbled around for it when I pulled it out of my pocket, nearly dropping the thing. The phone screen read “Beth” with a picture of her and her husband smiling in a family photo. I hesitantly answered the phone, holding it up to my ear.

“Hello?” I asked, thinking of nothing else to say.

“Hey, I was wondering where you were. You’re never late,” she said in a cheery voice. My eyes darted around until they landed on the clock to the oven. “7:55” I was late. I was late to Beth’s. I was late to work. I paused, spurting out an extended “um.”

“I’ll be there… soon.”

“Alright, good. Thought you weren’t gonna make it today.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll be there,” I said as I hung up, still on high alert and looking around for any sign of them. I slipped my phone into my pocket and looked over to see that breakfast was now completely ruined in the oven. It wasn’t on fire, but the food more resembled charcoal. I looked down to see that I did have my work uniform on and I was ready to go. I had everything besides Danny.

How was I going to explain to Beth that I had two Danny’s? It was impossible. “I have identical twins, and I’ve never let you once see them both at the same time.” There was no way anyone could believe that. I started to think or at least think the best I could. My brain was falling apart from the few hours of sleep I had and the adrenaline flowing through it for the past thirty minutes. Me and Danny had been through some rough times. I thought, and I thought. When his dad left, we could barely afford food. There were days when we may have only eaten once or twice, even when he cried. That’s when I thought of a terrible idea.

*“Can he last the whole day?”*

It was a terrible idea, but the situation seemed so dire at the time. One of them had to be a monster, something supernatural. If I got lucky, I would be sending my son to the babysitter. “But what happens if it’s a monster I send?” I thought. What happens if I send one Danny there that turns into a big bumblebee, one that kills them all? I didn’t know what it was capable of. I had only seen it for the past forty-five minutes. It could be the end of the world for all I know.

I looked back up at the clock. “8:02” I was supposed to be at work two minutes ago. I needed to hurry. I started to pick up my pace and face my fears. I ran through the hallway and to Danny’s bedroom door. I listened closely and heard soft breathing from the other side. It was faint. I slowly opened the door, expecting to see my son dead and some giant monster eating him. Instead, I saw two Dannys sitting side-by-side wiping away their dried tears on their red chubby faces. Both of them had crying faces on but looked like they had cried all they could. I felt terrible. I felt sick for what I knew I was going to do. I needed to know which one was the wrong Danny. I went back to the only difference I could think of. I didn’t even know if it was the right one.

“Hey, Danny.”

“Mama…,” they both started to cry again, shaking in tears.

“Did you like sleeping in Mama’s bed last night?” One of them looked at me a bit confused while the other one started to cry harder, exclaiming “Yeah!” They both stopped crying and looked at each other again, completely freezing and noticing each other’s differences. It was my time to do something rash. I jumped forward and grabbed the Danny who said “Yeah!” and pulled him up into my arms. I did not dare to look at the other Danny. I held him in my arms as I ran out into the hallway, making the same path to the living room as I had before. I flung the front door open and slammed it shut, running to my car. I moved him forcefully into his car seat and buckled him, he didn’t resist. He was just confused and scared.

I got into the front seat and pulled back out of the driveway, stepping hard onto the pedal and running it down the street, barely stopping at the stop sign. Danny started to pipe up.

“Mama, why you do that?” I cranked the volume knob on the radio nearly to the max, playing some song I had never heard, a song I didn’t even like. I didn’t want to hear him. I looked in the rearview mirror and saw him looking up at me before absentmindedly looking out the window. I remember thinking, “At least this Danny seems normal.” The drive to Beth’s house was silent apart from the music blaring over everything. As I pulled the car to the side of the road, I turned the music all the way down. I moved with haste, quickly unbuckling Danny and picking him up. 

I saw Beth on the porch waving toward me with her classic smile. I ran up to the porch and set Danny down on his own two legs, his face still red and raw from crying earlier. I looked up at Beth and said two words.

“Running late.” As I was running back to my car, she yelled out.

“See ya later!” I got in the car and floored it to work.

I quickly walked into the diner, expecting to be berated for my tardiness. I went to the back, checking what orders we had and what jobs I could do when Elizabeth tapped me on my shoulder.

“You seem to be in a hurry, dear,” she said. At first, I was startled and turned around quickly. I looked at her until I slowly realized who she was and what was happening. Elizabeth was an older woman, maybe in the late years of her 60s. She was the boss’s wife and acted as a stand-in manager. She was also behind many of the homemade recipes they baked into their dishes. Her curly, blonde-dyed hair bobbed as she smiled at me. I must have been looking at her like a deer in headlights.

“Are you alright, Tori?” she asked in a motherly voice.

“Yes… Yes, I’m fine,” I replied with a lie.

“You don’t look fine,” she said accusatively, but still caring.

“I… I can handle myself,” I lied again. She looked up at the clock.

“You know you were twenty minutes late, right?”

“I know. I’m sorry. I don’t have an excuse.” I did have one. It was more unbelievable than “My dog ate my homework.”

“What’s got you so worried? You ain’t worried about being late, are you?” I shook my head, looking down, too ashamed to look at her in her eyes. I needed to think of a lie, something to say.

“Danny is sick.”

“Your boy?”

“Yes, he got sick this morning.” The harsh words from my own mouth battered against me. Each lie felt like another weight added to my heart in the Judgement of Osiris. Elizabeth put her hand on my shoulder, making me jump and look up at her.

“Is he okay?” I froze again, not knowing how to reply.

“I... I think so.” She must have sensed that something was wrong with me and before I knew it, she had pulled me into her embrace. She wrapped her bony arms around my back and patted my shoulder with her palm. I felt the sudden urge to cry, but against all odds, I kept my emotions at bay. The contact and warmth from her made me forget about the child I left at home, whether he was Danny or a monster. The tension in my body lessened as I put my arms up around her too.

“Thank you,” I muttered.

“He’s going to be just fine, hon,” she said as she rubbed my back. She pulled away and looked at me again, this time with a smile.

“Now, how about we go cook?” she said. I breathed in deeply, shuddering for a moment before nodding my head and looking up at the ceiling to not let my tears fall. She grabbed my hand and let me further into the kitchen.

My day got a bit better in the meantime. I forgot about my worries and thought about cooking. I stayed in the back for most of the day, Elizabeth coming in to check on me every so often, knowing I wasn’t feeling well. Maybe she thought I was getting sick too. This shift flew by, my spirits getting up again, talking to my coworkers and making casual jokes. I felt good again. I finished up my shift and went to Elizabeth, thanking her once more before leaving. Her reply was something along the lines of “Anytime, dear.” I changed in the bathroom like usual, throwing my gas station uniform over my cook uniform. I was out the doors, in my car, down the road, and already working before I could think about anything else. Working was easy. It made me not think.

I met Tiff inside and started small talk with her. One of her kids had gotten arrested for possession of meth. It wasn’t surprising since she was a reoffender, but Tiff needed to tell me all about how she gave her the life to make good choices and go to college when she didn’t even graduate high school. I was happy that someone else was talking to me and keeping me occupied. For most of the day, I helped in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning where I could. I didn’t feel cheery enough to talk to customers about our new “buy one, get one free” deal today. Tiff happily obliged by taking that spot, ready to hear any new town gossip and to readily talk about her daughter’s screwup life.

As the night came to a close, Tiff brought me out again for an end-of-the-shift break. I went outside, the familiar green lights and humid air hitting me again. It was the first time I had actually looked at something without seeing everything as a blurry mess all day. It was the first time I had thought since that morning, and my first thought was that I was hungry. I hadn’t even taken a break all day. I hadn’t eaten all day, I was starving, but I wasn’t going to leave Tiff out there alone, so I stayed. I walked around the building and leaned against that familiar brick wall; she was already smoking at this point. She blew a big cloud out and turned to face me.

“So, what’s with you not wanting to be up front today? You usually always wanna be.” She had cut the head off of the snake, going straight to the root.

“I uhh… I’ve not been feeling well today,” I said. Not a total lie, but a vague answer.

“You sad or something? Or are you ‘sick sick’?”

“A bit of both,” I finally answered with a hint of honesty. She pushed off the wall and moved in front of me, putting the back of her hand against my forehead while her cigarette hung from the corner of her mouth.

“You got a fever or somethin’? You don’t feel hot.” My stomach growled.

“I… I haven’t eaten much today.” She moved her hand back and used it to take another puff on her cigarette, turning her head and blowing it in the opposite direction.

“When’d you eat last?” I couldn’t answer her; I was embarrassed. I looked down at my feet, ambiently staring at nothing. I started to shake, partially from fear and partially from energy loss. Tiff put her arm around me and held me up, leading me away from the wall.

“C’mon, girl, let me get you somethin’ to eat. I’ll pay for it an’ everything.”

“Please don’t,” I spoke softly, shaking.

“Nope. I’m watching you eat, and you ain’t goin’ home til you do.” I didn’t have any other choice. I had to. I knew I needed to, but I didn’t want to. I was so caught up in work, and I didn’t even feel hungry at the moment. That’s what I thought at least. I knew the real reason was because I had left my son at home to starve. I couldn’t eat without him, but I needed to. I wanted to stay strong for him, but I couldn’t. I gave in. Tiff went to the back and made me a sandwich, special for me. She brought it to my hands. It had tomato on it, which I hated, but I wasn’t one to oblige in that moment. I took a few bites, slowly chewing the food with a pit in my stomach that only grew as I ate. It didn’t taste good, it didn’t feel good, and I felt terrible for eating it… but I needed to. 

“So, why aren’t you eatin’?” Tiff asked with no regard or filter. I just looked up at her as I took my last bite. She watched me like a vulture waiting for an animal to die.

“I don’t know. I haven’t been feeling well, and…” I paused for a long time.

“Danny’s sick.” Her ears perked up again. She never changed.

“Aw, he’s sick? How’s the little guy doing?” I recited the same lines as before after that.

“He’ll be fine, I think.”

“I remember those times. He’ll get sick all the time, every other weekend. It’s the terrible twos.” For a second, my heart dropped. I thought she had caught onto me, that she was going to call me an abusive mom, and that I had been starving my son. Then I realized what she had said.

“He’s three. He’s three years old,” I said quickly, interrupting.

“I didn’t realize he was already three.” We sat there for a few seconds before she redirected the path of the conversation.

“So, is he getting you sick too? That why you can’t eat?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“You ain’t pregnant, are you? Can’t imagine you having two kids right now.”

I wanted to cry at that comment. It hurt. I couldn’t have two kids in my state. It was impossible, and I was going to learn how hard it was. I solemnly shook my head “No.” She sat up from the small crate she was on, looking up at the clock and realizing it was a bit after my time to go. She patted me on the shoulder.

“Time to go, Tori.” She grabbed my hand and lifted me up.

“Thank you.” 

“No problem,” she smiled.

“Now get on home,” she said as she gave me a gentle push forward. I started walking out to the door.

“Drive safe… and tell Danny I say ‘Hi’ to him.”

I opened the doors and walked out without looking back. Everything returned to a blur and zoomed out as I got into my car and started driving down the road, keeping my arms perfectly stiff. I couldn’t think anymore. I just needed to get home and go to bed. I wanted to shut my mind off completely. I started the drive to Beth’s house with little memory of the drive. I only remember thinking one thing.

"My son is dead, isn't he?"
