*Tapping in the dead of night, might cause a dreamer quite the fright. But if you're quiet, and move with care, you might see Big Knock standing there.*


When I was 11 me and my friends often found ourselves bored at recess. With the older kids getting the basketball court, we had to make our own fun. One of the ways we did this was by telling stories or making up scenarios. Most were whimsical and lighthearted, what you'd expect from the imagination of a child. Some were "scary" if you could even use the word. We'd make up stories about how *Slenderman* or some other creepypasta mascot visited our home on a dark stormy night. It wasn't very clever or original, but it was entertaining enough for us.

There was this girl who was especially interested in the scary and occult, almost to an obsessive level. She was always the one trying to scare the more lighthearted kids by showing them those old "cursed" photos that went around the internet back in the day. She was interesting for sure. 

One particularly slow day she decided to tell us a story her older sister first told her. The story was a little convoluted, and definitely had the spice of a preteen's imagination. The short version goes something like this: *A woman was worried about her husband, who had insomnia. She was sometimes woken by him getting up in the middle of the night just to shut the closet door or close the blinds. Eventually he came to her, ranting about something that wouldn't leave him alone in the night. She was worried about her husband, and had him taken to the doctor. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and given medication. He seemed to be getting better, until one night he had an episode and shattered a lamp throwing it at the bedroom window. He was admitted to a psych ward, for both his safety and his wife's. However, on his first night there, he killed himself.*

After telling this story, the girl went on to explain how it was actually a real monster watching him threw a window the whole time, and it was the monster who killed him. Real creative, I know. However childish the story might be, it still scared us. We were children, after all. The girl seemed especially proud of her story, continuing to tell slight variations of it for days, weeks, months after the fact. Even as kids, we were tired of it. We didn't have to listen to it for much longer though, for she had to leave the school. Her sister had killed herself.

Fast forward a couple years and I'm a freshman in high school, with all the opportunities of junior varsity basketball games and failing to hear back on my job applications. I hadn't thought about the girl, or the story in years. Why would I? Sure, it was tragic. A mother coming home from work to find her 17 year old daughter bleeding out from both wrists in her bedroom, but as an outsider, you forget it eventually. But then, it all comes back.

At a school assembly, we mourned the loss of a bright sophomore boy. He had killed himself. He had a perfectly normal life. Upper middle class, loving parents, decent grades, lots of friends, and yet, he killed himself. For some odd reason, it stuck out to me. Not as another tragedy, but something familiar. I remember my friend's older sister, and the equally odd circumstances of her death, and I was curious. Could there be a connection? I found myself talking with one of the friends of the boy who had passed. 

"-and you're sure nothing in life was bothering him? Nothing at all?"

"For the last time, asshole! No! Why do you care so much! ... You didn't even know him!"

I may have struck a nerve. Perhaps I came off as insensitive, rude even. But I was curious. And curiosity killed the cat. I soon found myself outside his house at around midnight.

Now, I know that sounds bad, and this all seems very fast, but things made a little more sense in context. I had been thinking about it a lot. About my friend's sister. About the conection between the two deaths. Maybe it was that nothing this interesting had ever happened in my home town. Maybe it was that I carried about the two families, and wanted to give them a reason they might desperately crave. What I was doing was for the greater good, at least that's what I told myself as I slide open his first floor bedroom window.

I had committed a crime, a pretty serious one at that, for seemingly no reason at all. That wasn't what was going through my head though. His room was eerily sanitary. Empty of most belongings at this point. Maybe they were repurposing the room. 

I opened desk drawers, nightstand drawers, looked under the bed, in the closet, basically anywhere something could be. What was I even looking for? What did I expect to find? I had already lost hope. I was opening the window again to leave when I noticed something I had previously missed. The glass was slightly cracked. On top of that, it was smudged slightly, like how your phone screen gets too dirty if used too much without cleaning. 

I was so dialed in to the meaningless detain of the window that I almost shit myself at the sound of something hitting the wall across the room. I turned around, expecting to see a pissed parent. I was instead greeted by the closet door. I had already looked in there. Slightly spooked, I walked across the room and opened up the door. There was a box in the floor, and an open attic hatch swinging from the ceiling. I must have missed that.

Picking up the box, an old shoe box, I opened it. It was multiple pieces of standard notebook paper, with little doodles on it. The drawings all seem to depict the same thing, a very thing figure with a football shaped head and a large fist. Odd. There were also multiple drawings of snakes. Very detailed drawings. They looked like your average garden snake, common for the area. This might seem mundane, but at the time, I was scared shitless. With the box in hand, I scrambled out the window and booked it down the block. I barely even cared about the mysterious second floor to the families quaint ranch house. I wanted to be back home and in bed.

I looked at the drawings a lot. They were really quite strange when you think about it. The thin figure resembled something I'd see on a creepypasta website. Nothing made it particularly scary, it was just uncanny enough to be unsettling. Lots of things were unsettling recently. I've been finding myself craving fresh air. Inside feels very stuffy. I've been struggling to sleep a lot more, causing me to be more jumpy and spacey throughout the day. I had also been seeing more garden snakes recently.

I was reading a board in one of the hallways in school. It hadn't been updated it a while, the school newspaper section still had events from before the boy had killed himself. I knew that because his name was listed as an author. He was on the school newspaper.

Something about that struck me. He worked for the paper. There's nothing weird about that. Is there? No. A sane person would have answered "no". And yet I soon found myself in the school library, with a stack of school newspapers. 

Before she had passed, my friend's older sister had gone to this high school. That shouldn't seem weird. Same school district as the elementary school, a normal person would have put that together already. It was news to me. 

Before I knew it I was scanning through all the older papers, looking for any trace of her name. She played varsity volleyball. That's neat. She was in yearbook. Cool. She killed herself. Oh.

The article was depressing to put it lightly. Bright young girl with a promising future gets it all cut short. I had knock that already though. The shocking information was the author of the article. I'm sure you can put this one together.

Sleep was almost impossible by now. I was making connections where there weren't any at all. I had my own box with notebook papers, these ones covered in ramblings of how these two people were possibly connected, what could have happened, what it all meant. 

4 am. I must have zoned out, because when I came to, I was drawing a garden snake. I felt like I was going crazy. All I could hear was a flute being played softly in the distance. What the fuck?

I found myself walking down the road, one foot infront of the other, like a robot. Actually, it probably looked more like a zombie from the outside. I was following the stupid sound of flute. Emphasis on the was, since the sound had been gone for a while now. I was just looking at my feet, walking. 

Wether it was dumb luck or fate that I look up and saw the house I had broken into just a month prior I'll never know. Felt more like a taunt at the time. I had no reason to, but I was already opening the window. I stepped inside the room. It was a mess. Or maybe it wasn't, but it smelt like it.

I didn't need to think about it, it just made sense. I was opening the closet door, and the hatch was already open, this time with a ladder and all. Climbing up the steps, I poked my head into a dusty attic. Crazy, right?

Crawling up into the disgusting excuse for an attic, I noted two things. One: This place is crawling with snakes, ew. Two: There's a peice of paper nailed to that beam over there. Crawling over to the paper, I pulled it from it's position. There were only a sentences on the thing, but before I could begin to read it, I heard something. Someone was knocking on the window.

I head down the steps as the knocking gets louder. I trip on the last one as one of the knocks is accompanied by the sound of glass cracking. Tripping out into the room and looking at the window, I see it.

What's "it"? I remember it seeming familiar, but I'm not quite sure. Part of my recovery was blocking it out. All I know is that after that I smashed my head against the bedframe. His parents must have come quickly, because I did survive. Obviously. 

I wasn't charged. I was fifteen and deemed "mentally unwell". At least that's what I think they said. I was in a psych ward for a while. I got some sleep, my head healed, I got better. They found the papers. All of them. Mine, his, the attic one. I don't know what they did with them, im not allowed to know. A younger me would have gone out to find them. I'm not as curious anymore.

I did see the attic one again. Last week, actually. I was scrolling through my moms phone to get a photo from freshman year homecoming, and there it was. A photo of the paper I didn't get to read that night. It was underwhelming, really. On another note, I saw a garden snake today. That's not odd by itself, but I saw it in my apartment's bedroom. I'm gonna talk to my doctor about getting some Zolpidem.
