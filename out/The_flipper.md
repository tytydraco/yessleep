I’ve been hiking these mountains since I was a kid mostly solo stuff, nothing crazy, just getting away from everything for a few days. Last July I took off for a loop up in the North Cascades that barely anybody does anymore. Old logging road to start, then straight bushwhacking up a ridge. No blazes, no people, just me and the bugs.

Second day out I was feeling good. Made camp early by this little creek, ate some dehydrated chili crap, and figured I’d wander up the slope a bit before dark to see what the view was like from the next bench. Sun was getting low, everything golden and quiet.
That’s when I saw the guy.

He was maybe a football field away, down in a little dip between the trees. Naked as the day he was born, tall and skinny, skin real pale. At first I thought he’d gotten separated from his group or something lost his clothes, hypothermia setting in, you know how your mind jumps to practical stuff.
I opened my mouth to yell “Hey, you okay?” but the words kinda died.
He was doing backflips.

Not running and flipping like some gymnast showing off. Just standing there, bending backwards real slow, hands touching the ground behind him, then kicking his legs over and landing on his feet again. Perfect every time. No wind-up, no bounce. Flip. Land. Pause half a second. Flip again.

I stood there like an idiot watching him do it maybe ten, twelve times. Same exact motion, same exact spot. Didn’t make a sound no breathing heavy, no leaves crunching under his feet. Nothing.

I finally got my shit together and took a couple steps closer, trying to see his face. He never looked up. Head always pointed straight ahead or down, like he was flipping for his own damn self and didn’t know I existed.

At some point the light changed and the shadows got longer, and I realized I’d been standing there way too long. My skin was crawling. I backed up slow, keeping him in sight until the trees blocked him, then turned and booked it back to my tent. Didn’t run didn’t want him to hear but I moved fast.
That night I kept my knife out and barely slept. Every snap of a twig had me sitting up. Nothing came near camp, though.

Next morning I packed up quick and bailed on the loop. Took the long way out, added an extra day of walking just to hit a trail I knew. Got back to the truck a day early, drove straight home, took a long shower.
Didn’t tell anybody for weeks. Figured they’d think I was nuts or that I’d seen some nudist yogi or whatever.

Then one night I’m screwing around on a local hiking forum and some guy posts a blurry photo same drainage, same time of year. Caption just says: “Wtf is this?”

Comments were full of people who’d seen the exact same thing. One dude said he watched for twenty minutes straight. Another said he went back the next weekend with a better camera and the guy was still there, still flipping. Got within shouting distance and the guy just… wasn’t. Like he vanished the second you decided to get closer.

I haven’t been back to that ridge.
Sometimes when it’s real quiet at night I’ll think about it how smooth those flips were, how he never got tired, never looked around. Just flipping.

Over and over.

Like that’s all he does. All he’s ever gonna do.
