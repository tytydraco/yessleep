Something is wrong with my house. i can hear someone else here, walking around, moving things around.. In the morning when i come out of my room, somebody was in the kitchen, doing god knows what!


Yesterday i went out on a walk, when i was coming back, i saw someone sitting on the porch. i couldnt go in, so i ran away. After wandering for a long time, i decided i'm going back home, i cant just ran away from this person or whatever it is.



I headed back home, got in, everything looked good. Nobody else in sight. i went straight to the bathroom, talking a nice hot shower. After getting out, while i was heading to my room, i heard someone in the other bedroom, walking around. It was here, that person or thing was still here.



i couldnt help but run to my room, locking it. I stayed in my room and eventually fell asleep. 



i woke up in the morning to the sound of someone singing and whistling, someone moving around as if they owned the house. They didnt care if i would hear them, no they didnt. I was terrified what's happening.



After a couple of hours i got out of my room, the house looked empty, that person or thing was gone again. i took a deep breathe and went into the kitchen. i spent the rest of the day laying down on my couch, watching tv. Everything felt so calm and cozy. 



Just when i was about to doze off, i heard someone, someone opening the front door. i froze, i couldnt move, who the hell is breaking into my house? and why? i felt dizzy, too scared to make a noise. i stayed on the couch unable to move. Then i saw a man, a man walking inside my house, he looked tired, he didnt even look at me, he went straight upstairs, without even acknowledging me! the owner of this damn house!



i was furious, i knew there was someone or something in my house, trying to invade my space! for a long time now. i decided i have had enough, so i got up , grabbing a large knife from my kitchen, i headed up the stairs.



i'm gonna sort this shit tonight! i cant live like this anymore in my own freaking house. i have to do it. i have to face whosoever that man is.



i slowly started walking up the stairs, one stair at a time, trying not to make any noise. When i finally got upstairs, i started walking towards the other bedroom i kept hearing the noises from. I stood in front of the door, carefully holding the knife. For one last time, i took a deep breathe and pushed the door open. 



Nobody was in the room, but i heard the shower running. That man was in the bathroom, using the shower! How dare he?!



When i entered the room, i heard the shower turning off, the man must have heard me and realised he's been caught, huh, bastard! 


i waited outside the bathroom door, for him to come out. After what felt like forever, the door knob moved, as the door started opening, i saw the man peeking out from behind the door. He looked scared. He slowly came out and walked right past me to his bed, looking around. 


He acted like he couldnt see me. He kept looking under the bed, in the closet, looking for someone. I was standing right in front of him and he couldnt see me? what nonsense! He must be pulling some sort of trick on me, i thought. 


i started moving towards him, when i got right next to him, i pushed him with all the strength i had left in me but h-he he didnt even move, my hand, my hand went right through him. What was that, i thought to myself, what's happening.


The man ran out of the room, scared. I was left confused, what in the f'ing hell?. After thinking for a minute, i came to the conclusion; that he is a ghost, a ghost walking around my house, that's why my hand went right through him, that's the only explanation right?. 


i went downstairs, to go look for him, i am getting him out my damn house today! no matter what. I ran back downstairs, looking for the man and there he was standing in the living room, doing something on his phone.


He placed the phone on his ear and started talking, "He-hey man! i need your help! Can you stop by my house please? i heard someone walking in my f'ing bedroom when i was taking a shower, when i came out nobody was there, i looked around the whole house but couldnt see anyone, not gonna lie man i'm terrified. i have been hearing things around here lately, things that i cannot explain. You come here, i'll tell you everything".


What did he mean by all that? and his house? what?. Just when i was about to confront him , he ran out the front door, grabbing his carkeys from the coffee table.


i couldnt process anything that he said. I sat down on the couch, trying to think.
i dont remember when i fell asleep. In my sleep, i had a dream, i saw myself lying on my living room, covered in my own blood. My throat was slit open and i- i was dead. It was me and i was no longer a-alive. 


i saw two police man breaking the door open and coming in. As soon as they saw my body, they covered their face and looked away. They called in for backup and slowly started moving away, looking around the house for someone, my murderer maybe. 


I woke up and looked around i was in my house, but it wasnt mine anymore. Suddenly everything started making sense. The man wasnt someone living in my house but its his house, his own house, while i-i am a ghost, a ghost making that poor man's life a living HELL.
