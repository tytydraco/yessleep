*Note: For reasons that should be fairly clear, I’ve changed a few names below. Other than that, everything below is retold as truthfully as I can remember.*

Marcus Teller wasn’t a billionaire when I dated him. This was back in the early 2010s, when his startup was just entering the first stages of success. He had money, and a bit of fame, but he hadn’t been on the cover of Fortune yet. 

I wasn’t exactly starstruck. At the time, we ran in the same social circle of recent Ivy grads trying to make it in New York. I was no model, but I was pretty in a bookish way that attracted plenty of attention from young men like him, so I wasn’t surprised when he cornered me at a mutual friend’s party and talked at me until I’d texted him my number. 

Marcus was tall, pudgy even back then in his early twenties, full of confidence and bluster that seemed to mask a deep insecurity. Within five minutes of talking with me, he’d mentioned that his sister had clerked for a Supreme Court Justice and that his father had ten senators’ cell numbers in his phone. 

He left a few messages over the next week, proposing coffee, drinks, even inviting me to an office party as his plus-one. I politely declined each invitation, citing a busy work schedule at the publishing house where I interned, which wasn’t entirely false. 

For a few weeks, his messages stopped. I found myself regretting the way I’d dismissed him. He was good looking enough, clearly bright. You could already tell he’d be someone important, even if he was aggressive. 

When my phone beeped early one Saturday morning, I was a bit surprised. 

*Marcus: Been over in Davos for a bit. Mind-blowing conversations! Anyway, back now and I used some connections to get a reservation at Mickey’s tonight at seven. I’m sure you’ve heard of it. My treat…*

Of course I’d heard of Mickey’s. It wasn’t a restaurant, exactly. The people who ran it called it an “ephemeral culinary event space.” It showed up for a night at a time in various spots around the city. Reservations could only be had for people in the know, and it cost five figures just to get in the door. The menu was prix-fix, wine included with each course.

I held the text up for my roommate, Raina, to read. 

“Holy fuck, Cassie, do it!”

I shouldn’t have been surprised at her reaction. She’d once dated a guy mostly because he was an engineer at Ticketmaster and could get us free concert tickets. 

“If I go, he’s going to have certain expectations,” I said, waffling in my own mind. I wasn’t repulsed or attracted by Marcus. Not yet at least. I didn’t know quite how to feel about him. 

“Guys will get expectations because they bought you Taco Bell. This is Mickey’s. I say, do it, and then Uber home if he acts like a dick. Or maybe you’ll actually end up liking him. Could be a cool story to tell the grandkids, right?”

I tried to remember all of the rumors I’d heard about Mickey’s. One girl claimed a friend of a friend had seen them kill and butcher a live cow in the middle of the event space before serving steak tartare. Another said she’d been served a bottle of wine recovered from a sunken Spanish galleon. 

I texted back.

*Me: 7:00 works. What should I wear?*

*Marcus: Anything!* 

\*

My Mickey’s experience started around sunset. At first, I was sure Marcus had texted me the wrong address. It was a ferry dock I’d never heard of before, way over by Hunts Point. It was dark and getting misty. Somewhere, a foghorn blew. I almost told my Uber driver to take me home. 

Then I spotted a crowd of people gathered by a dock down the street. It was an eclectic mix: plenty of guys in suits, fresh off a day grinding in out in the Financial District. Some girls dressed in insane over the top stuff, like it was the Met Gala. Then there were others in more hipstery type clothes: expensive tight jeans, cut-up Armani Exchange t-shirts. 

I figured I’d found the right place.

As I approached the crowd, Marcus ran up to me. It couldn’t have been more than half a block of jogging, but he was still slightly breathless from the effort.

“Wow,” he said. “Wow.”

I looked down. Since he’d offered no instructions, I’d gone with a little black dress I’d plucked off the rack at Nordstrum’s for a few formal events my senior year of college and accessorized with a bit of silver jewelry and matching flats. 

“Thanks,” I said, still waffling between flattered and icked-out. Marcus was dressed in a white button down shirt with a blue blazer and khakis as if it were still summer. It wasn’t *totally* out of place, but it betrayed a certain obliviousness. Maybe that was part of his charm. 

He offered me his arm and I took it. We walked back toward the crowd, a subtle blend of expensive colognes and perfumes wafting around us as we joined them. Then, almost out of nowhere, a ferry appeared through the mist. It might have been any normal boat, except that it had almost no lights on, like its operators were intentionally trying to stay hidden.

In little time at all, the ferry had docked. A few men in tuxedos helped rope the ferry to the doc and then laid down a metal ramp. They didn’t say a word, but the whole thing put me a little ill-at-ease. It took them a few tries to get the ropes right, in a way that made me think they hadn’t done this many times before.

Finally, we boarded, Marcus carefully holding onto me as we ascended the ramp to make sure I didn’t take a spill into the East River. We stayed connected as we ascended a flight of rusty stairs, up to the main deck. Then Marcus reached forward, opening a rust-rimmed door that led to an enclosed sitting area.

Suddenly, it was like we had stepped onto fucking Mars. Black cloth wrapped every wall and window. All around, tropical plants, uplit at bizarre angles made the place feel like a jungle. Outside, the fall air had been crisp, almost cold. Here, it was muggy. Suddenly, all at once, boxes shaped like treasure chests opened, and a throng of butterflies emerged, fluttering all around us.

For a moment, I sat enchanted, realizing that each chest had held a different color: orange Monarchs, yellow Swallowtails, radiant blue Adonsises. A red Lacewing alighted on my shoulder, and I couldn’t help but smile. It delicately folded and unfolded its winds, tickling my bare skin. 

And then, suddenly, Marcus plucked it off my shoulder and popped it into his mouth. It took everything I had in me not to scream. 

“Marcus!” I said. “What are you–”

As I said the word, I looked around the room and realized he wasn’t the only one eating. As I watched in disgust, I saw a girl in a white dress caked in swarovski crystals pluck a green butterfly from her hair and pop it into her mouth, smiling and chewing, then opening her mouth so her date could see she’d swallowed the whole thing. Everyone was eating. Everyone but me.

“Is there a color I can get for you?” asked Marcus. “Maybe that lavender one?”

“That’s a Purple Emperor,” I said softly. I’d spent several weeks in the loft of our house one summer leafing through a book about butterflies while my parents argued downstairs. I tried to remember if it was safe to eat. Yes, I thought. Purple Emperors were technically non-toxic.

Marcus grabbed the butterfly, carelessly crushing its wings as he handed it to me. 

“I like the blue ones best,” he said. “You have this one.”

I looked around and realized that one of the men in the tuxedos was watching us. His eyes were cold. A few other guests were watching too, waiting to see what I’d do.

“Come on,” said Marcus. “You’re not picky, right? This is starting to get kind of embarrassing.”

Carefully, I took the butterfly from his hand. Its little body was shaking slightly, its tiny legs scrabbling in the air. It was in pain, I told myself. It was a mercy.

I popped it into my mouth, crushing it against the roof of my mouth with my tongue. I didn’t stop until I felt it stop moving. Then, finally, I relaxed my tongue. It tasted like nothing I’d ever had before, a kind of organic, soil-like umami somewhere between dirt and seaweed.

“Good, right?” said Marcus, beaming. “Way better with Champagne, though. Kind of dries out your mouth, right?” 

I nodded weakly, realizing I was trying not to cry. A waiter came by with a tray of long-stemmed flutes, and the other guests accepted them in turn, no longer paying attention to me.

Marcus took two glasses and handed me one. 

“What is it?” he asked the waiter. 

The man didn’t reply but gestured to a small white card on the tray, reading “1943 Pol Roger, London England, sparkling white from the private collection of Winston Churchill.”

Marcus took a sip and gestured that I should do the same.

“Not bad,” he said after a second. “I thought it would be more bubbly? Maybe it loses some of the carbonation when it gets old like this.”

A piece of the butterfly was stuck in my teeth. I could feel it lodged there. Frantically, I tried to work it out with my tongue. Then, finally, I took a swig of the ancient wine. It was flat and a bit too warm with a vague undercurrent of vinegar. I swished it around in my mouth, working the piece of butterfly free before finally swallowing.

“Good,” I said, nodding at Marcus. “But I’d better pace myself.” I tried to hand him the glass, but he took a step back, like I’d tried to burn him.

“Careful,” he said. “Every element of this dinner has been meticulously planned. They really won’t like it if you waste food or drinks. That wine in your hand costs over five grand a bottle. And its yours. No one else’s.”

I looked around and realized a few waiters were watching me now. I took another sip. If anything, it tasted ever more strongly of warm vinegar now. As I lowered my glass, the men’s eyes never left me. 

Suddenly, I wanted nothing more than to run out of the too-hot room. I looked toward the door and saw two men as big as rhinos, also in tuxedos standing in front of it. 

“I need to get off,” I whispered to Marcus. 

“And what? Swim back to Hunts Point?”

Something dropped in my stomach. When had we left the dock? I walked over to the doorway, looking past the men and saw that what Marcus said was true: we were a long way from shore now, far enough that the city lights twinkled in the distance. 

One of the men cleared his throat and adjusted a bit of black fabric behind him, eliminating the city view.

“You should go find your seats,” he said meaningfully. “The soup course is about to start.”

I was about to say something when Marcus took my arm, pulling me toward one of the able a bit too forcefully.

“Hey,” I said. “You’re hurting me.”

“I’m helping you,” he said. 

“Helping me what?”

“Maybe not embarrass yourself? Maybe not disappear into the Atlantic Ocean at night?”

I looked back at the large men by the door. They were watching me intently. I imagined how easily they might pick me up and toss me into the cold black water. 

I couldn’t have weighed more than a hundred pounds; I barely ate back then. I hadn’t gone swimming since high school. I was boney and tended to sink in my parents’ slightly green backyard pool. 

Dark thoughts bit at me like sharp-toothed fish, the same kind that would eat my corpse if I did the wrong thing at this dinner.

“Soup?” asked Marcus, attempting a reassuring smile. It was something he would never master. Years later, as his company was going down in flames, multiple investigations ongoing into a massive fraud, I would see him try that same false smile on CNN. 

No one would believe it then either.

We sat at a banquet table draped in a tablecloth of fresh leather. I had never seen such a thing before. The other guests were running their hands along it, whispering about the quality, wondering aloud if it was cowskin or some other synthetic material. 

My bowl was a shell, gleaming with a pearlescent sheen. Inside, it was half-full with steaming, brown liquid containing a pyramidal stack of cubed meat. A spoon of carved wood sat beside it. 

Suddenly, a voice boomed through loudspeakers, invoking the French words *“Cuisse Humane”* in a low monotone.

“What’s that mean?” I asked. I’d taken Spanish all through school, a more useful language.

Marcus shrugged. “I’m trying to learn some Mandarin on Duolingo. French is practically a dead language anyway.” It seemed like an asinine thing to say, but he spoke the words with such authority that I couldn’t help but nod.

Around me, several women tittered before reaching forward with their spoons to take their first bites. Marcus did the same, closing his eyes in pleasure as his lips closed around the meat. His mouth was suddenly horrifying to me. I was sure he’d try to kiss me later. Kiss me or worse. I hoped he’d take my ‘no’ gracefully but feared he wouldn’t. 

“It’s amazing,” he said. “It’s like beef turned into sex.” He nodded at a cluster of nearby waiters, and I realized they were watching me intently. Watching and whispering.

“Eat,” Marcus whispered, his tone no longer friendly.

I reached forward with my spoon and took a cube of meat. It glistened like a topaz in front of me. I couldn’t deny how good it smelled, like the scent of ham filling the house on Christmas morning at my grandfather’s house. 

And yet my lips wouldn’t open. The meat trembled on my spoon. The deadly men watched. Marcus watched. I felt naked, burned by too many eyes. Down the table, a girl had already finished her meat and had picked up her shell, trying to drink the broth. It slipped out the sides and splashed onto her chest, ruining a dress that cost more than my father’s salary. She and her friends laughed hard.

“Eat,” commanded Marcus again, and I relented. I opened my mouth and let the meat inside. There, it sat on my tongue, slowly melting like butter.

It was the best thing I’d ever tasted. Or would ever taste again.

Marcus smiled.

“Told you,” he said. Then, raising a hand, he shouted for red wine.

Many hours and many courses followed. There were noodles shaped like stars supporting a glistening sphere of meat that melted at the touch, revealing a buttery center. Two different steaks followed, the meat tender as belly fat. At one point, we were served a tree of bread, all hung with cured meats, hanging from its branches like ornaments. 

Wines accompanied each course. They were vintages owned by famous men and varieties that had gone extinct decades ago. One may have been from Constantinople in the time of the Byzantine Empire, though that seems impossible in retrospect.

By the time the final dish came out, I was full to bursting, my head swimming with drink. By then, Marcus’s hand was lying in my lap, his hand kneading my thigh in a way I’d decided was pleasing. 

All of the fear and anxiety that had welled up at me in the early stages of the night was gone, replaced with a kind of bliss I would never experience again. I felt like I had come out of a dark cave after years of eating nothing but stale bread only to find a vibrant forest of glistening fruits. My senses were on fire. I wanted to lick everything: the plates, the tablecloth, maybe even Marcus.

The voice–*it may have been God’s voice as far as I was concerned*–boomed from the speakers: *orteil sur un lit de laitue.* Carefully the waiters laid down plates covered in silver domes, something I’d only seen in cartoons. Then, all at once, they lifted the domes with a flourish. All around me, peals of laughter filled the room. 

As for me, it took everything I had not to scream.

There, sitting in front of me, sat a human toe on top of a bed of lettuce. The toe was entirely intact though dark with sauce and sprinkled with pepper and herbs. Still, it was whole enough that one could easily imagine it wiggling to life if reattached to a foot.

All at once, the fear flooded back to me. My stomach turned. I wondered what punishments might befall me if I threw up. I imagined myself roped to a glistening steel table, screaming as a chef slowly took me apart with a paring knife.

All around me, the diners exchanged glances. Then, one began to slowly clap and others joined in. The girl who’d doused herself with soup reached forward and plucked the toe from her bowl, popping it whole into her mouth. She chewed and smiled as the rest of us watched her. 

Then, finally, after a few seconds, she spit out the nail.

She continued chewing, working every last morsel off the bone. Finally, she spit that too into her hand and laid it back on the lettuce. It looked harmless enough now. A little white lump that might have belonged to a pig or a cow. But it hadn’t. It had been attached to a person. Maybe a few hours ago. Maybe a few days. But recently.

The rest of us looked down at our plates. Some people were giggling nervously. Others cut at the toes with knives, trying to saw off small pieces of flesh. A few more popped the toes whole into their mouths. I felt bile welling up at the base of my throat.

I looked over at Marcus. There was no toe on his plate. Where had it gone? Then I looked up and realized that his mouth was full. He was chewing something methodically, like gum. He smiled at me.

“It’s good,” he said, a bit of drool escaping from the side of his mouth. “Like, really, really good.”

I looked down at the toe on my plate. If I didn’t eat it, I didn’t know what would happen to me. Maybe nothing. Maybe drowning in black water. 

I took my fork and gently prodded the toe. Turning it in the light, I noticed a fleck or red nail polish clinging to the side. For a moment, I felt certain I’d vomit, but I was able to overcome the reflex.

“Is everything okay?” asked a waiter, towering over me. “I assure you, the meat is cooked perfectly.”

“It’s just–” I pointed to the fleck of nail polish. “Should that be there?”

The waiter looked at the red polish, horrified. In an instant, he’d whisked my plate away, muttering apologies. 

I looked up and down the table. Half of the toes were gone now, the meat consumed, the bones littering the plates like soggy marshmallows. For a brief moment, I allowed myself to consider the possibility that I wouldn’t have to eat one. Perhaps I would be spared, ushered along to dessert, my failure to cannibalize forgotten.

And then the waiter returned, a fresh plate in hand. He laid it on the table in front of me. There stood the largest toe I’d seen in all my life. I imagined the man it must have come from, some kind of seven-foot giant, his basketball career now cut short.

“Compliments of the chef,” said the waiter, his smile a threat. 

It seemed impossible that I could consume such a thing. I doubted I could fit the whole thing in my mouth. Everyone else had finished their food by then and were watching me with eager anticipation. 

“People are watching,” whispered Marcus, pointing out the obvious.

“I want to go home,” I said, quietly. I’m not sure anyone heard. I imagined myself an hour in the future, puking my guts out in my apartment’s small, clean bathroom. I wanted so much to skip every moment of my life until then. 

“I never should have invited you here,” said Marcus quietly. “Everyone said you were a prude. I thought I could change you. But here we are.”

“You’re a monster,” I said quietly.

“I’m an alpha,” he said. “But sheep can’t tell the difference.”

“My dish had nail polish on it,” I said quietly. “It’s ruined my evening.” I looked meaningfully at the waiter. “Ruined.”

The waiter recoiled slightly. It was the first time that evening I’d seen any of the staff on its heels. 

“I’m full,” I said a little louder. And then, without another word, I picked up the toe and dropped it onto Marcus’s plate. The waiter sneered, but he didn’t shoot me. Didn’t stab me with a steak knife.

“Congratulations, you’ve embarrassed me,” said Marcus. “Great story for your grandkids.”

“At least I’m not eating fucking human flesh,” I said.

And then he started laughing. Laughing and laughing. Others began to laugh too, whispering what I’d said to the other beside them. I remembered a birthday party I’d attended when I was younger when I’d accidentally wet myself while playing on a bouncy castle. Everyone had noticed. They’d even created a horrible nickname that followed me to school. Eventually, I’d had to switch districts. 

“What’s so fucking funny?” I asked Marcus.

He dabbed at his eyes with his handkerchief, wiping away tears.

“What do you think we’ve been eating all night?” he [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).
