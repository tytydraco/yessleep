The story it not really scary :) , some experience I had with strange entity presence .

I feel like demons not giving up trying to annoy and hurt me in dreams , the thing is I am a Muslim and if I go to sleep without making my ablution and reciting before sleeping supplication I get all sort of disturbing nightmares from abnormal excessively creature that want to harm me physically , spiritually , mentally etc , it feels that they are trying to make me tired by not getting good sleep or by making me have unpleasant dreams but guess what , the thing that I do before sleeping are really protecting me I do even starting thanks to God recite those supplication in the dream and mentioning the God Name 'Allah' and when I start that I always break free and feel at ease just after that I don't even think about it , I began doing that in dream and when I wake up I find my self muttering words of God 'Allah' <3 .

Sometimes it not easy when , I feel unable to move and talk as if something holding me from moving and talking but all praise to Allah the words comes out with power from inside Thanks to God , and when I wake I cannot talk right and I need some seconds to be able talk normally but the thing is I feel protected , sometime I want to find some place to run to and I just find a mosque just in front of me and when I do enter the mosque , nothing can really harm me and the nightmares end or it becomes a peaceful dream , and all feels peaceful although sometime I don't get enough , I don't feel tired the next day and continue my day as if I had slept well , sometime I get only 2 hours sleep and I can thanks to Allah , accomplish my daily tasks and work without anyone noticing that I am lacking performance or not having attention .

And in the contrary when I forget to saying my before sleeping prayer it really becomes a mess , I got really bad time at staying sleep and even if I try to force it , I end up regretting not saying my prayers I feel tired and exhausted the day after , sometime I got really unpleasant wet dreams , sometimes I dream of me running of crazy evil creature or repetitive unpleasant experience like real life event that none want to experience again, sometime the dreams feel life like and place is similar to were I slept .

One time I got the same nightmare several times in rows same night 3+ of unseen entity that is so near next to me and can feel its presence , and every time I wake up screaming 'Bismillah' In the Name of God , I still do not know 'till this moment if it was a dream or real , it was when I changed the place of where I sleep , but I did my prayers though and each time I go to sleep the same feeling comes to me again and again of that unseen entity presence next to me but as if there is a barrier that it could not cross , I don't know how to explain it , but I felt strange and unpleasant because and unknown thing being next to you trying to approach you without knowing what that thing is .

Long time ago one of my brothers may Allah guide him , he slept at that spot I am talking about and he told us that he saw an entity that has taken the form of one our relative a kid girl and she was staying in the stairs crying,(that relative live in reality next to us ), so he was asking her while laying down 'why you are crying' but then suddenly he knew that she could not possible be real the time ,the place and the behavior was inappropriate and could not be possibly true so he get up from that place running to us inside home telling us that he saw strange entity taking the shape of one of our relative , and he was describing the thing as if he saw it in rl not in dream , I thought at that time that he got a nightmare that just based on the place he was sleeping in , but after my experience I do not how to judge that , I don't really how to address it , the time between the two experience of my brother and me ,is in years and I when I slept there I don't even remember what my brother said even , so the probability of me being just influenced and taking unconsciously what he said would be really infinitesimal .

in summary doing supplication and sleeping after ablution save me great deal of energy the next day , instead of having to deal with nightmare and wet dreams that leaves me sometime with less energy and sleep .

I hope you have inspiration in this story and insight , maybe you can look into Islam and try doing the things I do before sleeping if you have bad time with sleeping and that you feel peaceful and could get rest ,and remember demons do really exist their just do their works as intrusive thought ,whisper etc . , many things that psychology could not explain or did not find solution to may as may not have some relation to the unseen world so protection is necessary and that because devils are the worst enemy of mankind that don't want nothing just to throw humans to agony and suffer directly or indirectly in this life and in the hereafter , all praise is to 'Allah' and 'Allah' knows best .
