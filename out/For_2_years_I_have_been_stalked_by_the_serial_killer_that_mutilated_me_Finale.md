3 days after I made my original post, I received another package.

Inside, there were a few unique items unlike the typical collection he would send before. I read the note first, which listed coordinates like always, but this time underneath, was written 'Did you really think I wouldn't see your little post online?'.

There was also the severed, brown furred paw of a large dog, and something about it looked familiar to me. There was a tag tied around the paw, the words 'She cried when I took it from him' written on it.

Just receiving the package alone was obviously unsettling and nerve wracking like always, but this was when I began to truly freak out. Something about this package felt extra personal, like every item, every word, meant something important to me in particular, but I didn't know exactly what or why.

The last item was a tape recorder. I picked it up and pressed play. The screams and panicked cries of a little girl sounded out from it's speakers, as well as the tortured screams of a wounded dog.

No. No. No. No. No. I kept thinking, immediately going to search up the coordinates to prove to myself what I already knew and dreaded to be true.

The coordinates were my younger brother Evan's house. The dog paw was from his German Shepherd Cooper. The little girl crying on the recording was my niece Allie.

I screamed wordlessly in anger and despair, immediately texting 911 and my trusted colleagues in the police department, grabbing my firearm and two speed loaders, and then getting into my used Toyota Camry to begin the 2 hour drive to my brother's.

The whole drive there, I couldn't help but think about how this was all my fault, how I failed to protect them. I had long ago quietly cut them out of my life, my line of work being too dangerous, and I didn't want them anywhere near it. Besides, when you had seen as many murdered or abused little girls as I had, it was hard to look your little niece in the eyes without seeing the same thing happening to her.

After the incident with the serial killer, I decided to really go full no contact, vowing never to talk to them again. I didn't want him finding them and using them against me like he was doing right now, and I decided there was no reason for my niece to have to see my horrifying visage. In fact, they didn't even know that any of this had happened to me.

I kept attempting to text my brother, but he was unresponsive. When my old colleagues arrived at his home, they called me to let me know that no one was there, but that there were trails of blood littering the inside and outside of the house.

I screamed and cried, banging my fists against my steering wheel as I continued speeding onward.

When I reached the house, I rushed to go inside with my gun drawn, but the officers stopped me, the only reason I probably wasn't shot being because of my old colleagues intervening.

It was hard for me to listen or snap out of my rage and grief at first, but once they had gotten my attention, they managed to calm me down, telling me that they had gotten ahold of my brother.

Several of the local police officers stared at me in shock and disgust as my colleagues relayed the information to me, not knowing what to make of my disfigured face.

It turned out Evan, Allie, and my sister in law Natalie were all at the emergency vet waiting for Cooper to get out of surgery, as it seemed another animal had bitten his paw off, and he was being sewn up.

I gasped in relief, almost dropping to my knees, but I knew the much more sinister truth that they did not yet, and I knew I'd have to be the one to tell them.

I waited for my family members to return home, two police cars with two officers each both parked outside to guard the house.

My brother cried when he saw my face, questioning if it really was even me.

I sure as hell didn't feel like the same person he knew and remembered, to be fair.

His wife covered her mouth, but she quickly recovered and offered me a warm smile, which I did my best to return.

Allie stood in shock, but her mom led her along, telling her it was time for bed. She had grown a lot since I had last seen her, now 8 years old instead of 3. She had her mother's blue eyes, but not her dark hair, instead having mine and Evan's blonde coloring.

Evan carried the drugged up Cooper upstairs to sleep in bed with Allie and Natalie, promising me he'd be right back so that we could talk.

When he returned and began asking me questions, I handed him one of the cards I had made for ease of communication a few months after losing my tongue, a suggestion one of my doctors had made to me.

He took it and read the simple two words typed out upon it 'I'm mute'.

"Jesus," He said, looking like he was about to cry. "Want a drink?" He asked, looking me in the eyes.

I nodded, already feeling the alcohol withdrawal kicking in, thankful he made the offer before I was forced to insist to keep myself functional.

As we sipped on Johnnie Walker Red Label, Natalie staying upstairs to keep an eye on Allie and Cooper, I wrote down everything that's happened over the past 2 years, relaying it to my brother.

At first, he just read and understood calmly, until I got to my mutilation, then he cried, firmly gripped my shoulder, and grew enraged at the idea of this happening to his brother. As I continued, however, writing down the details of what had really happened to his dog, who had done it, and that they had done it to  get to me, his anger then turned towards me.

He screamed at me for some time, scolding me for endangering his family, but then he calmed himself, his empathy and compassion returning to smother the fury.

"I've gotta check on my family, it's been a long day," He said as he relaxed himself with deep breaths. "Take the couch for tonight. Help yourself to anything to eat or drink. I'm going to bed."

I nodded, agreeing to this, but as he was walking away, I stopped him and pulled his attention back for a moment. I wrote 'Gun within reach' on a piece of paper and showed it to him.

He understood what I meant. "Was already planning on it," He said, giving me a sad and frustrated slap to the shoulder. "Goodnight, big bro."

I forced out an awkward smile with my scarred face, and let him leave to be with his real family.

I threw back a few more gulps of the red label, and then made myself comfortable on the couch. I kept my gun tucked away within my coat to make sure the kid couldn't get to it, but that it was still within immediate reach if the bastard tried to show his face.

I cleared the rest of my things from my pockets and set them on the coffee table next to the couch, however, one of those items being a small tracking device that was linked to my phone. If I managed to find any trace of him or his vehicle, I'd try to plant it on him, so that the police could follow him and catch him red handed, or so that I could.

I laid back after that, attempting to relax, but keeping my one eye open all through the night, waiting for that bastard to try something, so that I could end this, so that my family wouldn't have to live in fear.

I ended up passing out for a few hours beyond my control some time late into the night, something that bothered me, as I needed to be on alert at all times, but every once and awhile, my exhausted mind and body would shut down and go into stasis, just long enough to keep me alive.

Nothing had seemed to happen during those few hours, however, as when I awoke, Allie was sitting on the floor in the living room, playing with spread out toys, watching some movie with a big green guy and a donkey on the living room TV.

Cooper lay sprawled out on a dog bed in the corner, clearly sedated with pain medicine.

I sat up, rubbing my eye and yawning.

"Morning, uncle Howard," Allie called out to me.

It was clear that she didn't actually remember me, that her mom had informed her who I was, especially since when she was 3 she called me Howie like her father did, but I was grateful for the effort she was putting in.

She turned back and I waved to her, again forcing a near impossible to form smile.

She stood up and walked over to Cooper, gently petting him. "You should pet him, too," She suggested. "So that he knows he can trust you." She looked back to me quizzically.

I nodded, standing up and stretching my aching back before walking over. I knelt down slowly, my old cartilage devoid knees cracking and aching as I did so. I gently rubbed the fingers of my right hand through his fur, and he genuinely seemed to calm and relax a bit from it, enjoying my touch.

Suddenly, Allie snatched up my left hand. It shocked me at first, but then I just calmly let her take it. She examined the stumps of my two missing fingers, and then looked up at my missing eye and scarred face.

I felt self conscious, like my disfigurements were scaring her, but I let her look, let her study them for her own curiosity and knowledge development.

She nodded, sure of something, and gently let my hand go. "You know," She started, craning her neck like she was thinking deeply about something. "I was thinking while you were still asleep, that you and Coop are just alike. Both missing pieces, but still family." She looked down at Cooper's missing paw, and then gently leaned over to hug him.

This time, my smile wasn't forced, and my eye began to water a little bit at the understanding and kindness of this little girl.

"Howard?" Natalie asked from behind me, and I turned to see her standing in the archway between the kitchen and the living room, holding a plate with eggs, bacon, and biscuits on it in one hand, and a mug of coffee in the other. "Would you like some coffee and breakfast?"

I nodded, getting to my feet and making my way over to take the plate and mug from her. I guess they had already sat down to eat before I had woken up, deciding to let me rest, the stress and exhaustion of the past 2 years and the relief of finding them alive and not taken by that psycho really knocking the sense out of me for those few hours.

After eating, while Natalie went into the living room with Allie and Cooper, Evan pulled me aside to talk in private.

"I told Natalie," He said. "At least, everything she needed to know to make sense of this and keep her and Allie safe. Allie doesn't know though, and I plan to keep it that way."

I nodded in understanding and agreement.

"What the fuck do we do now, Howie?" He asked in desperation.

I went to the notebook and pen still on the kitchen counter that I was using to communicate with him last night. 'Now we wait,' I wrote down. 'All we can do is wait for him to slip up and for the police to find him. But if he shows himself here again, I'll kill him myself.'

Evan nodded. "Only if I don't kill that bastard first," He said with determination. "For what he did to Coop, for what he put Allie through, for what he did to my brother..." He gripped my shoulder firmly, and I returned the gesture.

'I have to stay until this is over, until he's dead or behind bars.' I wrote down next.

Evan nodded. "We're safer together," He said. "You can stay as long as it takes."

For the next three nights, I barely slept, keeping watch down stairs, only slipping into brief states of unconsciousness for an hour or two every night while Evan kept watch over his family upstairs.

On the fourth night, as my body forced me to sleep more deeply than the on guard stasis I was in before, he came for us, almost as if he knew that was the night my body would give out.

I awoke from the needle being pulled from my arm, seeing him standing over me in the shadows as an intense tingling and warmth spread throughout my body. I desperately reached for my gun, my hands dangling limply as my fingers fumbled around, but it was gone.

"Looking for this?" He asked with a devilish grin that shone bright in the darkness as my eyes began to swirl, holding up my revolver and twirling it around.

I fumbled my numb hand across the table as I dropped from the couch and to the carpeted floor, just barely managing to grip the tracker there, making a show of hitting everything else off, to make it look as though I was just desperately reaching for anything to fight him with.

He laughed. "I have taken the future from so many families of this world," He said proudly. "Now I'm going to take your family's future as well."

I threw my numb body into his legs, making it appear as if I was desperately trying to attack him, but really slipping the tracker into one of the big pockets of his dark trench coat.

He easily pushed me to the floor, my body now fully paralyzed and unable to move.

He walked away then, and a few minutes later, came slowly walking down the stairs with my niece's unconscious little body slung over one shoulder.

I lay there for two hours, desperately trying to force my body to move, groaning in frustration as the killer was surely getting further and further away with my niece.

Finally, I began regaining the control of my body, and after several minutes, was able to get to my knees, then my feet, and finally regain control of my hands.

I grabbed my smart phone and clumsily unlocked it, opening up the app for the tracker, typing in my password for the app, and then seeing his location, he was only 24 miles away.

I stumbled up the stairs, at the top, finding Evan sprawled out on the ground, pulling himself out the doorway of his bedroom, a 9mm in his hand.

"He took Allie," He mumbled out to me.

I nodded, making finger guns with my hand and pointing in the direction of his safe, knowing I would need to borrow one of his as mine had been taken.

"18, 42, 91," He answered with the code to the gun safe in his bedroom.

I awkwardly made my way past him and into his bedroom, seeing Natalie sprawled out on their bed, and Cooper laying on his side on the ground, breathing heavily.

I quickly checked, seeing that Natalie was alive, with her eyes open, tears streaming from them, but she was still fully paralyzed.

Cooper seemed to be okay as well, but also still unable to move.

I fumbled with the dial lock of the safe, managing to get it open after two failed tries due to my still partially asleep fingers.

Inside, I grabbed a .45, slotted in a magazine, chambered a round, and stuffed the two already loaded spare magazines into my inside coat pocket.

I then stumbled out of the room, wishing I could leave Natalie with words of reassurance that we'd send help for her and get Allie back, but my mutilation made that impossible.

Evan was halfway down the hall now, desperately trying to get to his knees, and I lifted him up by his arm and began helping him along with me.

"We'll send help!" Evan mumbled out, craning his head back in the direction of his wife. "And get Allie back!" He left her with the reassurances that I could not.

We made it downstairs and I grabbed my car keys before we made our way through the front door.

From the thick smears of blood on the inside of the windshields of both police cars parked outside, we could tell that the officers had been murdered, but even if some of them were still alive and just injured, we had no time to spare if we wanted to save Allie.

I helped Evan into the passenger seat of my car and then I got behind the wheel, starting it up, most of my body's strength and function having returned to me now, and I sped away.

I placed my phone in the GPS holder, following the direction of the killer, and then pulled out a small strobe light with accompanying siren sound, turning both on, reaching out the window, and sticking it to the top of my car. It was extremely illegal for me to use, as it was impersonating an officer, but obviously, in that moment, I did not care.

Evan managed to get out his cell phone after a few minutes of needed recovery from the paralytic that had been used on us, and called 911. He explained the situation in order to get officers sent to the house to help his wife, and possibly the officers parked outside if any of them were still alive, as well as getting them sent to the current location of the killer.

Watching the tracking app, it appeared he had moved a bit, but for the most part, was now stationary. He must be at whatever location he planned to murder Allie at.

As we drew near, the police had not yet reached the area, and I turned off the siren to avoid detection if possible, slowly and quietly pulling my vehicle up outside an abandoned metal works factory.

Evan and I both exited the vehicle with our guns drawn and made our way inside.

Once inside, however, the factory was huge, and dark, with multiple branching paths. With no time to waste if we wanted to save Allie, I signaled for Evan to do the normally dumb thing in this type of situation, and he nodded, going left while I went right, the two of us splitting up to search for the killer and his daughter.

It was eerie and dreadful making my way through the dark of the factory, and I was filled with fear, but I was also filled with resolve to save my niece and stop this psycho.

I found him first, seeing him standing in the distance with some portable construction lights illuminating the area, holding a bone saw in his right hand.

Allie was strapped down to a work bench, just starting to regain consciousness, and he appeared to be waiting for her to be fully lucid before starting his work.

It seemed as though he reveled in watching the terror and agony his victims go through while he cut away at them.

I raised my firearm, speed walking forward as I fired off three shots.

The first hit metal pipes just to the killer's left, the ricochet, sound, and spark of metal glancing off metal causing him to cringe.

The man was so full of himself and had gotten away with his murderous antics for so long, that he was clearly shocked by having been found.

My next shot hit his right hand and the bone saw he held, blowing his fingers and palm apart and flinging the bone saw away.

He turned, pulling out my own firearm he had stolen from me with his left hand, and returned fire as my third shot went wide.

I felt two bullets skid across the ground around me, and I took partial cover behind a large metal pipe just as the third shot he fired sank into the lower left side of my abdomen.

The killer took off running.

 I fired two more shots in his direction before he was concealed by machinery.

I sprinted towards him, pausing before Allie to cover her with my body as she began to scream, now lucid enough to understand she was in danger.

The killer wildly fired the last three shots in the revolver back in our direction as he continued running away, and I took aim, firing four shots back at him.

I let the natural ricochet of my shots carry my aim up as I put a round into his left calf, his left buttock, and the left side of his lower back, my forth shoot screeching off metal as he rounded a corner, now limping desperately along as blood trailed down and behind him, letting out shrieks of pain.

Now out of sight, and clearly more focused on his escape and survival than us, I pulled my focus away from the killer and to Allie.

I unstrapped her and hefted her up, running in the opposite direction of the killer, and almost immediately running into Evan with his gun drawn.

"Allie!" He called out in relief, taking her from me and immediately beginning to check her over to make sure that she was whole.

"Daddy!" She cried back.

I waved him off, signaling for them to get out, and then turned back, heading to finish this.

I followed the trails of blood at a sprint, hearing the cacophony of police sirens now drawing close, and the sound of a car's engine roaring to life.

I made my way out the back of the factory just in time to see a brown Lincoln peeling away and kicking up dirt, and I took aim without hesitation, firing my last two shots in my gun into the back left wheel of the vehicle.

The tire erupted into flopping patches of tar, and metal cranked together, the wheel locking up and causing him to lose control of the vehicle.

It turned against the killer's will, crunching head first into a thick wooden telephone pole, and came to a violent and ungraceful stop.

I immediately ejected my spent magazine, slammed home a fresh one, and chambered a round in one fluid stream of motion.

I pied the crashed vehicle then, the sights of the .45 aimed right at the driver's seat, and began wordlessly screaming loudly, hoping he would somehow take my meaning.

To my surprise, he did, and even responded accordingly, throwing my stolen firearm out the open driver's side window.

"You caught me, Howard," He called out weakly, like his throat was being obstructed and he was groaning in pain. "I surrender."

I groaned out louder, signaling for him to open the door with the barrel of my gun, not trusting that he wasn't carrying another firearm on his person.

He weakly unlatched and pushed the door open, showing me his empty hands, one of which was practically destroyed, and revealing his blood drenched and ragged body.

"I need an ambulance," He said with a laugh, coughing as blood now made it's way up his throat and into his mouth.

I moved in closer, my gun trained on his face.

"Please," He laughed. "You're not actually like me, Howard. You don't have what it takes to a kill an unarmed -"

I fired three rounds into his face, blowing his features apart in a eruption of blood and gore.

Blood gurgled up out of his throat three times, and then he flopped over limply, dead.

It was over. It was finally over.

"Drop the gun or we'll light you the fuck up!" A SWAT team member yelled as they began funneling out of the factory behind me.

I immediately did as they instructed, dropping my firearm and raising my hands into the air.

"Get on the fucking ground! Now!"

I went to my knees, and then I was slammed face first into the dirt, my hands pulled behind my back and zip tied. I could now feel the pain and the wet warmth of the gunshot wound in my abdomen as the adrenaline of the chase and shootout was beginning to wear off.

I was taken into custody, escorted to the hospital, and had my gun shot wound treated while I was being questioned, eventually sorting it all out. My family and I are all now still in the hospital as I write this, being treated for the paralytic, and various other things, as well as tested to make sure nothing else had been put into our system by that psycho.

Everyone is now safe and doing well, all a bit shaken up and disturbed, but alive and  seemingly recovering.

I will not be going back to being a PI, and instead will be taking a position at my brother's construction company, where I'll be working with him everyday, sticking close to the family, and I'll be staying with them until I find a place nearby to rent.

I wanted to update you all as there seemed to be a good amount of people worried about what would happen next.

It's over now, and even though my body and mind will never be whole again because of what he's taken from me and so many others, I'm going to find a way to move on now, with the help of my family.
