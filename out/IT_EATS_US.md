“Alright, before we get on, my dad will literally kill me if we damage anything.” 

“Don’t worry, Thomas we know your dad loves his boat more than you,” Elijah said with a smirk. 

“Yeah, yeah. Funny. Just behave yourselves, please,” Thomas grumbled. 

“Babe, can you grab the snacks? I’ll take care of the coolers.” 

As Maya and Thomas stocked the boat with supplies for the day, consisting mostly of beer, wine, and every kind of salty snack you can imagine, the rest of us started loading in the last few bags. That’s when I noticed the name on the side of the small center console boat.   
 ite at Su s 

Weird name, I thought to myself. 

“ALL ABOARD!” Thomas shouted as he set down the third cooler, sloshing with ice and liquor. 

“Lord have mercy on my liver” Jess laughed as she stepped aboard. 

“No mercy for any livers, captain's order!” Thomas grinned, grabbing a little captain's hat and jamming it onto his head with theatrical pride. 

We all laughed. 

“Hey Thomas, what's up with that name?” I asked. 

“Oh, some of the letters faded. It used to say White at Sunset. Anyway, everyone ready?" 

 

The sun was already high when we left the harbor. Music blasted from the portable speaker Elijah brought, and within minutes shirts were off, and drinks were cracked. The clear bright blue water became darker the further we went out to sea and a refreshing breeze swept across us on this hot summer's day. I stared off into the distance, the sheer vastness of the ocean always intimidated me whenever I thought about it, something about the incomprehensible size I couldn't quite wrap my brain around. 

We dropped anchor about two miles off the coast. Close enough to see the shoreline, but distant enough to pretend we were the last people on Earth. Maya and Jess sunbathed as Elijah and I were getting ready to jump in the water. Thomas fiddled with the Bluetooth speaker. 

“You coming, Jason?” Elijah asked, holding a beer in one hand standing at the edge of the boat ready to jump in. 

“Yeah, give me a sec,” I said, sipping my now warm beer from a red Solo cup. I watched the water. A slight unease rolling in my stomach. Just seasickness, I told myself. 

Elijah cannonballed in, followed by a splash from me. The water was cool. Salty. Inviting. It immediately made me feel better. 

“How's the water?” Jess asked, getting up from the cushion she was sunbathing on. 

“Take a feel for yourself,” Elijah yelled, splashing water toward her. 

Jess shrieked and quickly jumped in too. As Maya was getting up to grab another drink, she noticed something in the water. 

A shadow.  

Not a cloud in the sky, and yet there it was, underneath us. Vast and dark. Big. Way too big. 

She blinked. 

It was gone. 

Like something had just passed under us. Something impossibly massive and fast. Something that wasn't supposed to exist. 

“Uh guys,” she called out. “Did any of you... see something?” 

“What a dolphin?” Jess asked from the water. 

“No. Bigger. Under the boat. And under you guys. Like... huge.” 

“Shark week got to your head, Maya,” Thomas laughed from the captain's chair. “Relax. This is literally the chillest day of the year.” 

She shrugged it off. Or tried to. But refused to get into the water. 

Later, we all sat around the console, sun kissed, eating Doritos and half-drunk, swapping stupid stories from college. That's when Jess suddenly screamed. 

Not a playful “there's a jellyfish” scream. 

A ripping, raw terror-filled scream that tore straight from the gut. 

We all jumped up. 

“WHAT?!” Elijah yelled, nearly falling off the side. 

Jess pointed, arm shaking, mouth wide open. 

And we all saw it. 

It was impossible to miss. 

Beneath the boat. Not right beneath. Far enough to blur in the water. But visible. It was... a silhouette. That's the only word for it. The size of a building. A skyscraper. It wasn't shaped like a whale or anything from National Geographic. It didn't have fins. It didn't have a tail. It didn't have anything. Just a massive, black rectangular presence. Like an actual skyscraper was surfacing right beneath our boat.  

“What the fuck,” I muttered.  

“THAT'S IT! That's what I saw before,” Maya yelled. 

"Jesus Christ, is it moving?" Thomas asked. 

"I don't know, it doesn't look like it. It's just... there" 

"Fuck it, anchor up! We're getting the hell away from here," Thomas snapped. 

He hit the button at the console. 

Nothing. 

“It's right below us. Maybe it's blocking the anchor somehow” 

I ran to the motor. 

Also, nothing. 

Thomas continued to flip switches like a madman. 

“Come on, come on...” 

But nothing was responding. The GPS: blank. The compass? Spinning in slow, lazy circles like it was drunk. 

“This isn't funny,” Maya said. Her voice cracked. 

I think that was the moment where everyone felt fear creep in. 

“Try the radio,” Jess said. 

Thomas yanked the radio from its clip and flipped it on.  

Static. Just static. 

Then a deep mechanical groaning came from below us. It vibrated through the hull and rattled into our bones. Elijah fell to his knees. 

“Jesus Christ,” he whispered. “What the hell is that?” 

No one had answers. Jess tried her phone. Nothing. Everyone began to panic. Yelling. Maya began quietly crying.  

“I'm going in,” Thomas said. 

“The hell you are!” Maya screamed as she grabbed his arm. “Are you INSANE?” 

“It could just be something with the chain. Maybe it got stuck. Maybe if I just check...” 

“It killed the motor, the GPS and our phones! It's not just the anchor. 

“You're right... but we need answers. I'll just take a quick look.” 

He put on his scuba goggles, slid over the side, and went under. 

We waited. 

One minute. 

Two. 

"Thomas?” Maya called, voice raw. 

Three minutes. 

Four. 

We were screaming. All of us. We called for him until our voices gave out. Maya sobbed, her knuckles white against the console. 

 

 

No one slept that night. We sat huddled near the center of the boat, holding onto each other like children. Swapping theories about what could be happening.  

Around 3 AM, Jess stood up. 

“What are you doing?” I asked. 

She didn't respond right away. Just pointed up. 

“I... I don't think that's the sky.” 

We all looked. 

Above us, there was a piece of the night missing. The stars, the moonlight, all swallowed in a clean rectangular chunk. Like someone had torn out a part of the cosmos and left behind a void. 

It wasn't a cloud. It wasn't a trick of the eye. It was just nothing. 

The same shape. The same impossible proportions. 

A second one. Above. 

 

Eventually we did fall asleep, but when we woke up at dawn. Jess was gone. 

Maya was the first to notice the writing. 

IT EATS US. 

Scrawled across the walls of the console. The floor. The sides of the boat. 

Over and over. 

IT EATS US. 

In black sharpie. 

“Oh god...” Elijah said in a raw sobering voice. “That's Jess's handwriting.” 

He stared at it for a couple of seconds and then threw up over the edge of the boat. 

That's when I remembered the name of the boat. The faded letters. Ite at Su s... 

I ran over to the front of the boat and looked over the edge. There it was. 

“IT'S THE NAME,” I yelled out. “The faded letters from White at Sunset, right here. Ite at Su s... It eats us.” 

“No...” Maya whispered. “No. That's not possible” 

“I think it is. It was always there. We just didn't see it.” 

Maya backed away from the railing and collapsed to her knees. I looked Elijah in the eyes. 

“Look man, if we stay here, we're gonna die. I think our best chance is to make a swim for the shore. Don't look down. Just swim and stay close to each other. It's only two miles. I think we can make it.” 

Maya shot up. “Are you out of your mind?! Look what happened to Thomas. That thing is still down there. We wait. We've been here for almost 24 hours. Coast Guard will come eventually. 

Then another sound. 

That same deep mechanical groan. But this time... it came from the back of the boat. 

Elijah and I ran. 

There was nothing. No movement. No splash. Just the same impossibly large silhouette below us. 

When we turned around Maya was gone. 

No sound. No splash. Nothing 

Just gone. 

Elijah was shaking. 

"We have to go,” I said. Trying to hide the panic in my voice. 

He nodded. 

We climbed into the water, holding onto the edge of the boat one last time. 

“Don't look down,” I said. “Just swim.” 

And we did. 

 

 

Three days later, the Coast Guard found White at Sunset drifting five miles further south. 

No damage. 

No sign of struggle. 

No one aboard. 

Just one thing written, again and again, in black sharpie: 

IT EATS US.
