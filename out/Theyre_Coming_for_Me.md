I don't know how much time I have left, but I feel I need to get this out. Someone needs to understand my mistake. My name is Jean-Paul Allard, I am 87 years old, and I am going to die. I wouldn't fault anyone if they assumed it was simply age that was catching up with me, but no. Most people would never assume I was over 50 when they saw me. Some would say I've lived a good life, and that is the reason for my youth, but I know differently. I know it has to do with them, with those creatures I created all those years ago. The ones that hunt me now.



As a child, I spent much of my life around death and dying. I was a child when the Germans came with their monsters and overtook us, I watched family and friends die at their hands as they resisted until their last breath. I ran supplies for the French resistance until the end of the Second Great War, and when it was finally over my family devoted themselves to trying to return beauty to our beloved France. They were artists, my mother and father. They could see beauty in even the most mundane of things, but all I ever saw was horror. I was young when my home was ravaged, and it left an impression on me that carried over into my adult years. Where my parents could create peace and serenity, I could only make chaos and pain. I did my best to take after them, to see the beauty in all things, but I was raised in a dark time, and I witnessed nothing but darkness for too long. So, my work reflected that darkness that I had seen in everything.



My parents would still compliment my work, saying they could feel the pain and the hurt being conveyed through my pieces. I told them I wanted to see beauty, and they would reply "There is beauty in pain, Jean-Paul. Just remember, not all beauty is found in the serene."



I continued my artistic pursuits, and at one point I found myself invited to share my pieces at a gallery in New York City. My parents couldn't be prouder. Still, the sorrow and pain I felt remained a predominant part of my life. The horrors of what happened to my people, and the darkness in the years that followed remained a prominent feature in my formative years, and when I made it to New York I only discovered new forms of this shadow. 



The gallery show was a huge success, and I made a decent little stipend. The owner of the gallery, a man with piercing blue eyes by the name of Luciano, informed me that he wanted to see more of my work and he wanted to commission a few specialty sculptures, to which I gladly agreed. After all, how many could say they made their living as an artist in New York City? Things were going quite well for me, and the shadow was starting to lift. My work took on a brighter tone, and those who had come to enjoy my work were not pleased. They enjoyed that darkness, reveled in the evil I showed them, and I couldn't journey back into the dark.



When Luciano inquired about the sudden change in my work, I told him honestly that I had spent a long time seeing nothing but pain and darkness in the world, and now that things were starting to change for the better, I didn't see that dark side of humanity any longer. He told me not to worry about it, that my current work was wonderful, and that I should be proud. There was something about the way he said it though, like he was trying to smile through gritted teeth. I'm certain he was displeased that I wasn't making him the same money that I had been, but for the first time, I could see the beauty my mother and father created.



Then  I was attacked.



I don't know if Luciano had hired the men or not, but one night as I left the studio a group of men jumped me in an alley. They beat me within an inch of my life, spewing insults as they assaulted me. I was left lying in an alley, several of my ribs most certainly broken. Just like that, the bucket of sunshine that I had started to fill was kicked over and I was left in the dark again.



They came to me in a sort of fever dream.



I was recovering in hospital from the beating I had endured, and at some point, I had come down with an infection. I lay in the bed, sweat soaking the pillow when the shadows first took form. They offered me a chance to recover, all they wanted in return was to come to this world, to be given forms by someone who had been touched by horror. I was sick, presumably dying. I shouted that I would do whatever I was asked. I swore I'd create bodies befitting the nightmares they were if they just kept death at bay.



The next day I was fine. My injuries had miraculously fully healed, and my fever disappeared. I was kept for observation for a few days, but soon I was back on the street and I had a project to create. I had promised these shadows a body, and for some reason, I believed I owed them.



The first draft was terrible, I used stone to try and sculpt my vision of the things I had seen and I hated it. Every night I dreamt of them, their forms souring my every thought. It was like they wouldn't let me forget them. For the second draft, I used an old weaving technique my grandmother had taught me when I was a child, collecting pliant sticks and weaving them together to form an intricate body and arms. I liked this more than the stone, it created the image that plagued my mind more clearly. Something was still missing, though. I couldn't quite place it, but I knew I wouldn't be able to truly bring this sculpture to life without it.



The inspiration was found one night after Luciano had visited me. As we were talking he shooed away a stray black cat, and something in my mind clicked. I realize now that I should never have spilled more blood to create this monster, but it plagued me. One pelt was not enough, and I found myself hunting the dark-furred strays nightly for nearly a month to collect enough to create what I wanted. I used their bones and claws to create the creature's hind legs and soon enough the first shadow was near completion. I just needed to create its face.



I should have stopped. I should have realized the dark path I was walking, but all I've ever known was pain and horror, to me, this was nothing new. It was simply a unique artistic process that I was using to create something wonderful.



I should have stopped.



I agonized over the perfect face for the creature, eventually purchasing a collection of variously sized taxidermy eyes in an attempt to find the perfect pair. Nothing spoke to me, and the image in my mind never showed its face so I could no longer rely on it.  "Help me,"I remember saying to the unfinished, faceless thing."Help me find your face...please."I passed out after hours of fruitless labor, drifting back into a sea of despair as the muses abandoned me once more.



When I woke, I was surprised. There was a small collection of what looked like folded leather sitting next to my desk, alongside a pair of eyes and what looked like an entire bowl full of teeth. As I held up the leather, I marveled at how supple it was, and the tone...it seemed almost human! It was perfect. I stretched the leather over the shape of the creature's head and collected the eyes.  They were unique as well, large and bloodshot blue eyes, the plastic even seemed to have some sort of coating on them to give them a better shine. I put them in place, not bothering to give the creature eyelids, it would want to see the world perfectly after all. When I started adding teeth, I just used the entirety of the bowl, realizing too late that there were far too many on this grinning abomination's face.



"Why give you lips, eh? You are beautiful the way you are, no?"I murmured, adding the last few molars to the entity. When I finished I leaned back and eyed the abomination I had created. It stood at around four feet tall, squatting on catlike legs with humanoid hands. Its whole body was covered in black fur save for the bald head. There was no nose, and it stared at me with those bloodshot eyes and an unsettling grin."You are magnificent..."I murmured, nearly fainting.



I created four of those monsters in total. Each time it would become easier, the necessary pieces just...showing up as I slept. I never showed these Grinning creations to anyone, they didn't need to see them, they were mine. My own creations, my own little friends to keep me company. Eventually, I lost contact with Luciano. One day he just...stopped coming to the studio and eventually it closed down. The police said they suspected he was involved with the mob, and just as they were starting to close in on information that could lead to his arrest, he disappeared. I continued to create pieces, my haunting muses now guiding my hand in these dark creations, and with Luciano gone, there was no longer a middleman to pay exorbitant finder's fees to. I amassed a small fortune, and retired in the late 90's. I should have been well into my 60s by the time I stopped, but I looked and felt no older than a 30-year-old man. People who slighted me, even in the slightest, would often disappear. I had been questioned by police many times in the 40 years I lived in the city, and each time nothing came of it.



It wasn't until I saw them do it that I put it all together.



I had invited a lover to my home, and by this time I had amassed a collection of beautiful things. I needed the beauty, it helped with the nightmares I had of these creatures. He admired many of my pieces, but as we entered the studio I saw them sitting out, staring at us. I was horrified. No one was ever supposed to see them, and when I wasn't working I had always put them up. What were they doing out?



"My *god* they're hideous!"he had exclaimed."Who made those monstrous things!? How horrible!"



"I...they're my muses,"I admitted, sullenly.



"Muses? Those things? They're abominations! You really should *burn* them."  I quickly escorted him from the room as he continued to berate them, shaking my head and ensuring they were really amazing. I wanted him to praise them and love them as I had, but the way he spoke of them made me feel nothing but shame. I glanced over my shoulder, and I could swear they were staring at us. 



We spent the night together and fell asleep in each other's arms, but when I woke he was not with me. At first, I tacked it up to him not wanting to disturb me and leaving in the morning, but then I wandered into the study.



There, in the middle of the floor, surrounded by those...things I had made, was the body of the man I had brought home. He was covered in cuts and scratches, his nose looked like it had been bitten clean off, but he was still breathing. I could just make out the shallow heaving of his ravaged chest. I shouted, horror in my voice.



One of the things turned and looked at me. I felt my stomach climb into my throat as it raised a single, gnarled finger to its lipless grin.



I screamed. Horrified, I ran as fast as my feet could carry me out of that house and I kept running. I couldn't go to the police, what would I tell them? My sculptures have been killing people? I'm certain that would go over wonderfully. No, I had to do something about them, I had to stop them.



I must've been three blocks away from the house when I finally collected myself enough to go back. When I returned, I marched straight into the study, only to find the body gone and any sign of the attack gone with it. I stomped over to the cabinet I kept them in and flung it open. They were sitting there, lifeless, but still staring at me."All this time..."I murmured."All this time you've been taking lives."none of the sculptures moved or acknowledged me. I collected one of them and hauled it into the backyard. I coated the thing in lighter fluid from the charcoal grill and set fire to it.



I stared at the thing as it burned, yet it continued to do nothing like it was mocking me. So, I burned the rest of them that same night. None of them ever reacted to my actions, pretending that I didn't see what I had seen that morning. When the last of them was a charred pile of ashes, I breathed a sigh of relief. I was free.



That night my dreams were filled with those creatures, visions of them slaughtering countless people and just wandering back into the cupboard at night and pretending like they did nothing. I couldn't get the sight of the one who silenced me out of my head.



I was awakened by a crash in my study. I shot up and looked at my door, had someone broken in? Slowly, I pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the bat I kept nearby for such occasions. Quietly, I crept, not wanting to startle the intruder, but when I arrived in the study there was no man to be found. I searched the room and found nothing, until I glanced upon the canvas that I had set out. Upon it, written in ash were the words"It's not that easy."My stomach sank, and I turned to face the cabinet, slowly I opened those cupboard doors and to my horror there they sat. Those freakish little monsters with their lidless bulging eyes and too-many-toothed grins stared at me. Whatever beauty I had seen in these monsters had vanished the moment I discovered their purpose, the darkness *I* had poured into them.



"So you are my curse..." I murmured, shaking my head. "Fine, then I will bear you, but you will never harm another, not so long as I can do something about it." I don't know why I resolved to simply let them be, but if burning them down to nothing wouldn't destroy them, then I had a feeling nothing truly would.



For over a year I tried to figure out a way to stop these things, to control them, but nothing seemed to work. I sealed them in glass cases, locked cabinets, and even tried to bury them. They simply kept coming back. Eventually, I built a room in my basement, a sort of twisted display case that I kept them locked away in. Their bulging gaze always haunted me, every time I journeyed down there I could feel them watching me, a malice building in their stares. So I wrapped their eyes in gauze. I sealed them in a room all their own and blinded them...and it seemed to work.



For ten long years, I didn't feel their hate, for ten years I left them in the dark and alone, and in those ten years, I began to feel the first onset of aging, as if whatever twisted gift they had given me was finally beginning to fade. I never left home, I became a sort of recluse trying to keep these monsters at bay. I boarded the basement door, chained it, and placed a heavy shelf in front of it in an attempt to seal the prison for these grinning bastards. I spent ten years having my groceries delivered to my front door, and I had amassed a small fortune so I didn't need to work. My only connection to the outside world was the television and the computer. Those were the loneliest ten years of my life. I needed someone.

  


I no longer sought love, but instead I wanted someone to speak to, just an ear to listen and an eye to admire the vast treasures I had collected. So, I put out a job offer on one of those gig apps. One young man accepted, Alan. He was a kind boy and he helped me keep my home clean, in return I paid well. It was nice to have someone present again.



During one of his cleanings, he had moved the shelf I had used to hide the basement door and he inquired about it. Why would I board up and chain this door, then place such a heavy shelf in front of it?



When he inquired I felt that malice again. This time it nearly overwhelmed me. They had simply been waiting, as if they knew they'd be let loose.



I urged him to let it go, that nothing good existed down there, only the past and dark memories. He seemed to understand and accept my plea, he even helped me push the shelf back into place. I thought that was the end of it, even the hatred coming from down below began to fade again.



I wish that was where the story concluded, that Alan hadn't done what he did, but he was a young man and curiosity is hard to escape.



My time with Alan helped me to realize that life was too short to spend it trying to just be a jailor to these monsters. I had to get out again, to journey into the public eye and spend time amongst the people. I spent the day shopping and even purchased a new car, then I chose to go to a nearby gallery opening, I had a wonderful time, and the people there truly had a passion for the artistic. I had even met another man who I had promised I'd see again. Things were going the right way, finally.



Then I came home.



When I entered I was overcome by the wave of hate the permeated throughout my home, and I soon saw why. The basement had been unsealed. The chains broken, the boards torn away, and the shelf moved. I rushed down the stairs and found Alan staring at them. He had removed the gauze from their eyes and there was nothing but curiosity in his gaze, but it soon turned to regret and guilt as he saw me.



​"Oh! Mr. Allard! I'm so sorry, I..."



I only shook my head and offered a calm smile. "I understand, my boy. Were I your age my curiosity likely would have gotten the better of me, too. These things..." I murmured, turning to face them, "These...grinners. They are a memory I wish to forget. So I sealed them away." I could feel their hateful gaze on me, but I continued to speak as though they were just pieces of art. "You should leave, Alan." I glanced at him as he grabbed his collection of tools and ran back up the stairs. My eyes drifted back to the fiends I had made. "I can't escape you, can I? It's not that easy." I smiled grimly and turned to leave, I knew their eyes were still on me, and it no longer mattered. 



That night, I was awakened by a soft tapping at my window. It was strange, I slept on the second story of my house and there were no trees outside, so when I went to the window I half expected the man I had met at the Gallery tossing pebbles to wake me. Call it hopeless romanticism, or just pure naivety, but when all you have for ten years are stories to read and watch, you begin to fantasize about those sorts of things.



I tossed my curtains to the side and nearly fell backward. There, clinging to the glass and lightly tapping against it was one of those Grinners. When we locked eyes, it raised a single clawed finger to its lipless mouth as it had done so long ago. This time, though, it breathed onto my window and scratched a single word into the fog. "Alan." My eyes widened, I rushed over to my phone and called him immediately. It was the middle of the night, I don't know what I expected.



​"Hello...?" came the bleary answer, sleep still clinging to the voice as it desperately tried to pull him back down.



"Alan! Alan please listen to me. They are coming for you, you need to leave, to run, do not stop until you are far from here."



"Mr. Allard what are you...?" there was a crash from somewhere on his side of the line. "Hello?" I heard him call through the receiver. I didn't know if I was too late, but then I turned to look at the window again. The Grinning fiend was still there, but the fogged word had changed.



"You."



I wasted no time, I gathered a few things and ran from that house. I ran to my new car, I drove for what must've been hours. I must've tried to get a hold of Alan at least ten times during that drive, but there was never an answer. I don't know if they managed to take him, but I know they're coming for me. Every night since that fateful evening, I've heard a soft tapping at whatever window or door is nearby. I know they're just playing with me.I know they're waiting for the right chance, but that's not my worry anymore. I know that some day soon they will take me, but then...then what? They've been my charge for over half a century. Will they find someone new, or are they simply free to do as they please now? Whatever the case...I am sorry.
