 

This all happened a few years ago but didn't have a good time to share it. WELL here we are now.

A few years ago I called an UBER driver to pick me up from a restaurant me and my friends went at like 8PM. 

This driver seemed pretty chill and nothing to be alarmed of. He took me home on the correct route then told me goodbye and left. 

Seemed pretty rushed to me but didn't think much out of it and he speeded off. I went home and was ready for sleep so I wanted to set my alarm so I don't miss out on any college classes that I used to take.

 But I couldn't find my phone.

 I looked everywhere but couldn't find it. I swear if I could pick up my house and just shake it as hard as I can so everything could drop I would.

 Anyway, I decided to look for it back at the restaurant so I called another UBER driver that took me there.

 As I got there I saw my friends still there eating their steak and lobster. So I asked them if I left my phone there both said no. I asked them can I use your phone to try and call my phone to see if it is in the restaurant.

 He said okay that's fine but I didn't hear anything. I decided to use the Find My iPhone App on my friends phone.

 Turned out it was in a place only 15 miles away from here. 

But I think it was in the woods. 

So I asked my friend if he could come with me to see where it had gone.

 So my friend drove me there. I was always freaked out of the woods.

 My parents used to tell me scary stories about it as a kid. So when I got there I wasn't to keen on going in there alone.

 So I asked my friend to come with me and he said okay. 

We cautiously walked in the woods and it said we were a few steps away. 

Then I heard a rattle in the bushes. I marked that in my mind but didn't see anything "Out of the ordinary" so I decided to keep moving.

 Then I saw a wooden cabin without any cars or a mailbox. 

I asked my friend who would live here.

 He said only a psychopath would and we both started laughing.

 Then we suddenly stopped and heard another rattle.

 But it was much louder this time.

 We both used the flashlight to point at the bush but we didn't see anything.

 We decided to walk closer and surprisingly there was a doorbell. We rang it and you know those doorbells that are like always in horror/eerie movies.

 Yeah that's basically it. We waited then heard someone say Yes? 

I noticed him right away. 

I said you're my UBER driver.

 He said yes and let us come in.

 I asked him do you have my phone? I tracked it down to here.

 He said yes he did have it and said he will be right back and don't go anywhere. 

We heard him go down in the basement where we kept hearing squeaks of the staircase every step down. 

We waited and waited.

 And waited. 

Then I asked, Are you still with us? 

I heard nothing. I decided to go down there with my friend of course but he was behind.

 Then I caught a glance of something under the staircase. I saw him staring at us from under with his glowing red eyes.

 It almost seemed unhuman like.

 I yelled sounding like a little girl.

 Then I saw something shining in his hand either a knife or a gun.

 I decided it wasn't worth risking my life for a phone and ran.

 He ran after us but we were much faster and made it to the car and told my friend to DRIVE.

 He was way ahead of me and we drove off.

 I don't remember his name.

 But I wish I had reported him then. I was too scared he will come and find me since he was the one who took me home.
