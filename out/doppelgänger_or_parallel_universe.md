This happened a few days ago, I am posting this because both my friend and I are a bit concerned.

I went to meet up with a friend for lunch. After lunch, we went to the nearby train station and it was a big interchange station with platforms on different levels. I was planning to take the stairs to my platform but my friend needed to take an escalator to hers. Therefore, we stood midway between the staircase and the escalator, chatted a bit before we parted ways.

I went for the stairs without looking back to check on my friend, she went the opposite direction towards the escalators. The staircase was an enclosed area with no glass wall whatsoever so no one outside would be able to see the people walking on the stairs, it took me less than a minute to reach my platform, meanwhile I took my airpods from my bag and started listening to music.

When I just got to my platform, I checked my phone and saw my friend's message a few seconds ago, asking if I have gone to the wrong direction because when she was on the escalator, she saw me walking backwards towards the escalators, opened the flap of my bag as if I was looking for something. She saw the profile of that person, she was 100% it was me because that person had the same profile, same hair, same jacket, same bag and same gestures as mine. However she didn't see her legs because they were covered by the glass fence.

It was for sure, not me.

It was really weird because it felt more than doppelgänger, the person my friend saw was in the same outfit, same station shortly before we parted ways. My friend and I both thought we are joking to scare each other but we did not. We have analysed the layout of the station, hoping what she saw was really just me but no, there was no way...

Now both my friend and I are spooked out, especially after i googled doppelgänger, which is traditionally seen as a bad omen, even death! I am hoping my friend was hallucinating or there was some sort of weird unexplained indoor mirage. Anyone had similar experiences? Anything bad happened after such experiences happened?

P.S. During lunch, I talked a lot about what is the actual meaning of life, I said things like people are trying so hard and making everyone miserable at work because they don't believe that one day, they will die. If they realise death is real, they wouldn't try so hard to do things like pleasing their bosses, blackmouthing colleagues etc and actually start to enjoy their lives. We have also discussed paranormal experiences that our friends and family members had. So, was she hallucinating because more than half of our lunch conversation was around the meaning of life and paranormal experiences? I very much hope so, we do not like such bad omen...
