His name was Hanratty, and we worked together at Bud’s Spuds. 



The first time I saw him, I thought, Christ, now they’re hiring the undead. 



He had this long back hunched over at the neck like a shepherd’s crook. His nose was hooked, his chin weak, his teeth bucked, but what stood out most about Hanratty were the two big black patches under his eyes. 



Anyway, the first few weeks, I stayed low-key like the parole officer told me. No complaining, no squabbling, no pushing pills on a new client base. 



At Bud’s Spuds, we had one job and one job only: trimming. The machine, I called him Tate, coughed out partially cooked and oiled potatoes, and us saps on the conveyor belt had to remove any black bits. It was like whack-a-mole (and occasionally partially cooked rodents came down the line). 



Anyway, one night, Hanratty just collapses, folds like a cheap deck chair, and our boss Dixon comes down to the factory floor. 



‘You been drinking Hanratty?’ 



Hanratty peered at him like he was a hallucination. 



(Dixon was even stranger to look at than Hanratty. He was round like a potato, in fact, a real good one, what the boys called a Bobby Dazzler. He wore a wig and on his wig, a hairnet that shifted and moved like flotsam). 



‘No, Sir,’ Hanratty replied. 



‘You been taking zippers?’ 



Dixon probably heard that on the local news. 



‘No, Sir.’ 



‘You’re on my factory floor like a goddamn ghoul.’ 



‘Insomnia, Sir.’ 



Dixon stroked his chin. ‘Insomnia, huh? You should try jerking off before bed. Always worked for me.’ 



‘Thanks, Sir.’ 



…



The night shift at Bud’s Spuds finished at 4 am, and in the changing rooms, I saw a medical opportunity. 



‘You know the good stuff isn’t zippers.’ 



‘I don’t want drugs,’ Hanratty answered. 



‘Woah, woah, keep your fucking voice down. I mean a beer (I didn’t, but it was too late now). You got time for a drink?’



‘Time is what I always have.’



We walked a few blocks from the factory past other creatures of the night lit by neon billboards screaming. 



We fit right in, the zombie and the convict; the whores did not approach us, nor the bums, because we were of the same station.



We found some dive place called Last Chance Saloon, and I thought well that’s just perfect. 



Bruce played on the juke-- Glory Days-- and two old pool hustlers knocked around the balls, their cigarette ends spilling ash around their feet. 



The bartender was an old black dude the size of a 1950s fridge. 



‘Two beers,’ I said. 



‘Two beers and two whiskey chasers.' 



‘No, two beers.’ 



‘And I said two beers and two whiskey chasers.’ 



One thing I’ve learned is you don’t haggle with night walkers. 



‘Sure, buddy.’ 



The beer was as flat as my white ass, and the whiskey poured in two murky shot glasses.



‘So what is it, Hanratty? Why can’t you sleep?’ 



Hanratty shrugged.



The fucker moved in slow motion; he probably had the resting heart rate of a tortoise.



‘Come on now. Men in bars at 4 am don’t keep secrets.’ 



‘Never been able to,’ he replied, ‘my mom was a mean lady.’ 



There was something backward about Hanratty, and it made sense. Sleep was for recovery. And if you hadn’t slept your whole life, the wound kept reopening, festering, destroying the healthy tissues around it. 



‘All our moms were mean ladies,’ I answered. 



‘Real mean. Religious mean. When I was a little boy, she told me dreams is where the devil hangs out.’ 



‘Yeah, Hanratty, your mom sure was a mean old lady.’ 



We watched the pool hustlers a while, and then the owner piped up. 



‘Drink up, fellas.' 



‘What the hell you mean?’ 



He smiled, gold tooth gleaming. ‘Even Last Chance Saloon has a closing time. 



So me and Hanratty continued walking the streets no obvious direction in mind. The sun wasn’t up, but it was threatening, and I wondered if Hanratty turned to ash when it did. 



The land of the living were motioning to wrestle it all back: A jogger came by us; a stack of newspapers was thrown into a newsagent doorway; an old Chinese lady went by carrying a box of loquats. 



‘The early bird catches the worm,’ I said. 



‘I never much liked worms.’ 



We walked maybe another block when we came to the ‘store.’ 



At first, I thought he was a waxwork. The guy was sitting right there in the window– a fella of uncertain ethnicity, uncertain humanness too. 



He sat in a rocking chair wearing a dark blue suit emblazoned with stars and crescent moons. Beside him was a nightlight and about the comfiest-looking bed I ever saw. 



He motioned both of us inside. Well, fuck it, I thought– we’re on a journey to the end of the night as it is. 



When I pushed open the door, a bell tinkled lightly, and a dreamcatcher swayed above our heads. 



The room looked like a rich kid’s nursery– a place where your mom wouldn’t thrash you for pissing the bed or tell you Satan dwelt in dreams. 



The rocking chair was empty, yet still rocking, and then the guy stole upon us. 



‘Gentlemen!’ 



I jumped and almost headbutted the fucker. 



‘Problems sleeping?’ he continued.



He was a roly-poly sort of guy, shaped a little like Dixon but pudgier, something like a giant baby. 



He had an English accent, a hint of hystericalness in his voice like a Broadway performer.



‘What kind of store is open at this time?’ I said. 



‘Well, what do you think? A store for people who can’t sleep.’ 



Glancing around, I saw the sign ‘DreamCache Inc’ and then his name tag Mr. Melatonin. 



‘A store for people who can’t sleep? What kinda gibberish is that?’ 



‘Well, there are stores for people who want to stay awake.’



‘There are?’



‘Yes,’ Mr. Melatonin’s moon face swelled. ‘We call them cafes… And there are stores for people who want to forget. Bars… And stores for people who are hungry. We call them…’ 



‘I get it,’ I said, cutting him off, ‘But what pills are you pushing to get people to sleep?’ 



‘Tablets? No. Never. Natural nocturnalism.’ 



I looked back as if to say, Well fuck you, buddy. Maybe I sensed competition. A lot of people who buy narcotics do it because they can’t sleep. Think narcolepsy. 



‘What is it you do?’ Hanratty said. 



‘A simple procedure.’ 



‘How simple?’ 



‘Our technical team inserts a chip into your cerebral cortex. Voila. An eight-hour visit from Somnus.’ 



I laughed. ‘A goddamn chip into my goddamn cerebral cortex?’ 



‘Yes,’ Mr Melatonin replied. 



His eyes were too wide open. 



‘And how much is it?’ Hanratty continued. 



‘It’s free, of course.’ 



‘Free?’ 



‘Jesus Christ, Hanratty, you can’t be taking this tubby fucker seriously. He’s saying he’ll cut open your skull and stick a bit of Lego in for free.’ 



Hanratty turned to me wearing the expression of someone much older, which I guess he was, at least in hours spent awake. 



‘The fine print,’ I said, ‘tell me the catch.’ 



‘No catch.’ 



‘You think you’ve found yourself a zombie and a dummy, don’t you? So how is it free?’ 



‘Ah,’ Mr. Melatonin raised a finger, ‘We include a 15-second advertisement before you enter REM sleep, a kind of trailer before the movie of your dreams.’ 



My lanky colleague was strangely beholden to this fat fuck fairytale character. 



‘Hanratty? No?’ 



‘What...’ he replied, ‘Do I have to lose?’ 



…



Hanratty took some holiday days, and when he returned to Bud’s Spuds, I was in for quite a shock. 



‘Hanratty, you handsome motherfucker.’ I called out. 



Well, that was a slight exaggeration, but he didn’t look half bad. 



Some of the stoop had left his hunched spine, he wasn’t so pale, and the panda eyes had faded. 



What’s more, he’d asked Dixon for a transfer to the dayshift, a return to the land of the living. 



I suggested Hanratty come for a beer at Last Chance Saloon. He said his drinking days were over, but he’d take me to a restaurant after work. 



‘Painless,’ he reiterated, ‘completely painless.’ 



Under the 4 am halogen lights of McDonalds, it didn’t look so painless. There was a 3-inch gash like a mohawk atop his dome. 



‘Painless?’ 



He took a handful of fries and shoveled them into his mush. 



‘I mean, a little annoying when I’m washing my hair, but it ain’t like I’m short of hairnets.’ 



Hanratty started on his Big Mac, taking the bun off and stacking it with McNuggets. 



‘And I tell you, I sleep like a baby shot full of fentanyl. 8 hours, 10 hours, sometimes 12 just for the fun of it.’ 



‘No side effects?’ 



He paused, slurping his XL Coke. 



‘No, not one. I’m a new man!’ 



…



I continued working the night shift and made a nice little side hustle pushing amphetamines on my fellow exhausted spud trimmers. 



And then one night, I sees official-looking guys in Dixon’s office. 



It took everything in me not to flee as the boys in black came down past Tate spitting out spuds. 



‘These men want to talk to you. They’re from the FBI,’ Dixon said. 



The FB fucking I. Was this it? Was I going down on felony charges? I reached deep into myself for untapped wells of bullshit. 



‘What can I help you gentleman with?’



‘You are friends with a Mr Edward Hanratty?’



Hanratty! This was about Hanratty. 



‘I am,’ I said. 



‘We need you to come with us.’ 



I glanced at Dixon. That motherfucker would stiff me for the pay. 



‘I’m afraid I can’t, Sirs. As you can see, I’m doing important work.’ 



The potatoes continued flying by.



The FBI guys looked cross. Dixon was momentarily panicked. He probably hadn’t paid his taxes since Bush One. 



‘No, no take as long as you need. Here at Bud’s Spuds, we value our employees.’ 



…



I told the Feds everything I knew, and it turned out I was their star witness. 



Some shady shit had gone down with Hanratty. Who’d a thunk it? A backstreet 4 am sleep parlor offering brain surgery. 



Before the trial, I was allowed to go see him in the neuro ward. 



When I arrived, his mom (Mrs Hanratty), was there along with a doctor. 



Hanratty was the double of the old lady– the build of a hat stand, the skull of a bird of prey– yet she looked meaner with it. 



‘He’s dead?’ she said, fingering a crucifix that hung outside a frowsy blouse. 



‘Your son is in a coma,' the doc answered. 



‘That’s just like Edward to get himself into a coma.’ 



‘What happened?’ I said. 



The doctor looked down at his notes. ‘Well, this procedure at DreamCache Inc– this chip– has catastrophically malfunctioned.’



I looked down at Hanratty, long and rail thin on the bed. His hooded eyes twitched. 



‘But he ain’t brain dead? I mean, he’s not a potato, is he?’ 



‘Just like my Edward to turn himself into a vegetable,’ Mrs Hanratty intoned. 



‘I’m trying to think how to explain this. We’ve had to invent a new term. A permanent purgatorial state.’ 



Well, that might as well have been in the Mandarin the surgeon who’d performed his operation spoke. 



‘The chip they implanted was programmed to play a 15-second advertisement straight into his ‘mind’s eye.’ It shows a family sitting down to enjoy a meal at McDonalds.’ 



‘And?’ 



‘Well, like I say, it malfunctioned. It plays on repeat the same 15 seconds. He’s trapped on the edge of sleep, watching it over and over and over.’ 



‘Jesus F Christ. Well, can’t you wake him up?’



‘We’ve tried everything.’ 



‘Well, can’t you put him to sleep?’ 



A flicker went through the doctor’s eye that seemed to say permanent sleep would be a mercy. But state authorities would hold the reaper off. 



‘He is… stuck.’ the doc continued. 



I leaned in. His lips were mouthing something. Something faint but repeating. It took me a while, but I got the pattern. 



‘Ba da ba bah, I’m lovin’ it.’ 



The doctor took his torch and shone it into Hanratty’s peepers. I expected a kind of blank stare, but his pupils were fixed into narrow pinpricks of horror. 



It wasn’t like at the movies when you (can) cover your eyes when Jason catches up, or in a dream when your 4th-grade math teacher throws abacus balls at you, and you pinch your skin to wake up. 



I’d only ever seen that look in people tripping on Magic mushrooms- in those trips that turned nasty and sent a fair amount of guys out of their minds. 



But even with shrooms, there was an endpoint. That fucker was in it for eternity and he certainly wasn't lovin’ it any more than a man chained up in a Chinese dungeon is as the next water droplet hits his forehead.



‘Just like my Edward,’ his religious nutcake of a mom continued, ‘to get himself stuck.’ 



We fell silent, and the machines around him bleeped, and his lips moved, repeating the jingle. 



Again and again and again.
