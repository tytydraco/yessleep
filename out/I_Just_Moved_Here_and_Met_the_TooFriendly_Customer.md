I was twenty-three when I moved to Eastwood. There wasn’t any dramatic reason; life had just been pushing me forward, step by step, until one day I decided to leave. I had always been close to my parents. Of course, they were a little sad, but they understood. I needed space, a fresh start, a clean slate. Back then, I imagined it would all be simple: new apartment, a small part-time job, maybe meet a few new faces.

Looking back now, I realize how naive that was. Things can change faster than you notice. Familiarity can turn into suspicion. Kindness can twist into something strange, threatening. I didn’t move here looking for trouble—but somehow, trouble found me.

I remember sitting in that taxi, the city lights blurring past the window.

“Where to?” the driver asked without looking.

“256 Willow Street, Eastwood,” I replied.

“Ah, Willow Street. New around here?” he murmured.

“Yes. Today’s my first day. I’m hoping for a real fresh start.”

“Eastwood isn’t bad. Busy, noisy, sometimes messy… but you get used to it.”

“I hope so. It’s completely different from where I came from.”

“You’ll be fine. Sit back, I’ll take you there.”

The ride was short. He chatted about little things—tips about the neighborhood, funny stories from locals. He seemed genuinely kind, and for a moment, I felt like maybe I could really start over here. When I arrived, I finally met the landlord, Mrs. Whitmore.

“Oh my, look at you!” she said warmly, laughing. “You’ve grown so much. I remember you running around here as a little girl with pigtails, back when your mom brought you over that summer.”

I smiled politely. Honestly, I didn’t remember any of it.

“Feels like ages ago,” I muttered.

“An eternity,” she nodded. “Your mom and I have known each other forever. When she told me you were moving here, I wanted to help a little. Here are your keys. Your apartment is upstairs, right above mine.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Whitmore,” I said sincerely.

“Get some rest first. A new chapter doesn’t write itself—you’ll need your strength.”

I hauled my belongings upstairs, but as soon as I stepped inside, my heart nearly jumped out of my chest. A man was standing in the middle of the room.

“What the hell?! Who are you?”

“The maintenance guy,” he said curtly. “Fixed the heater. I was told you wouldn’t be here until tomorrow. You shouldn’t be here today.”

“Please just leave,” I said firmly.

Not the best welcome. First night, and I already knew I’d be jumping at every little noise.

Later, after a shower and a quick bite to eat, there was another knock. An old man stood in the doorway.

“You’re moving in, huh?” he said flatly.

“Yes, just arrived.”

“Walls are thin. Keep the noise down. Lock your doors. There are some… odd people around here.”

“I… will remember.”

He stared for a moment, then left without another word. I unpacked a little, half-heartedly, and eventually collapsed into bed.

The next day passed with boxes, cleaning, and organizing. My mom sent a reminder about finding a job, so I applied to a small café nearby. A few hours later, someone named Lila reached out—I was to come by that evening.

That night, I met her at the café.

“Hey, glad you’re here. How’s the first day in the new place?”

“Chaotic. But I’m managing.”

“Moves are always chaos. Need any help?”

“No, I’m fine. Just trying to settle in.”

She smiled. “Don’t stress. We brought you in last minute—our last server quit overnight. You’re a lifesaver.”

I worked my first shift. It went better than I expected. Later, a man came in to retrieve a forgotten wallet, thanked me, and left.

On my way home, I ran into him again.

“You’re Clara, right?” he asked.

“Yes… you’re the one who lost the wallet.”

“Ethan,” he introduced himself. “Hey… do you use social media?”

“No.”

I lied. I don’t even know why.

He chuckled, but his gaze lingered too long. “Shame. Guess we’ll see each other again.”

I went home, ate, tried to sleep—until the old man upstairs pounded on my door, yelling for me to quiet down. I apologized, turned the volume down, and ignored the noises in the hallway.

Days became routine: work, home, sleep. Only Ethan kept appearing. Carrying my trash, asking questions, waiting outside the café. One day, he handed me a chocolate cupcake with a grin.

“You said you liked these,” he said.

I hadn’t told him. Only Lila. That scared me.

Then things escalated.  
A delivery arrived—already paid for.

“A tall guy with dark hair,” the courier said casually.

In the stairwell, Ethan startled me again.

“No ‘thank you’?”

He kept repeating himself. Same phrases, like it was rehearsed.

At the café, Lila appeared with a bruised eye. She called it an accident and left in a hurry. Ethan appeared again. He knew things he shouldn’t have. One night, I returned home to find my door open, a note reading **“Almost your friend”**, and messages on my phone. He had been in my apartment. He knew my full name. He knew when I got home.

I reported everything. Police statements. Nothing came of it. The number belonged to a woman missing for years. Lila quit. Ethan vanished from the café. Yet I always felt watched.

A few days later, Mrs. Whitmore knocked. Her son had been beaten up, followed by a stranger for no reason. She needed to leave town and warned me to be careful.

Things worsened. I managed the café alone, working late into the night. The walk home felt endless. One evening, footsteps chased me—faster and faster. I ran upstairs, slammed my apartment door, then silence.

Then the knocking.  
Harder.  
Closer.

A voice, right outside the door, strained, almost screaming:

“Open the door, Clara Hayes. Open it. I’m going to kill you. Open it.”

I recoiled, almost automatically. I ended up in the bedroom, hands shaking so much I could barely hold my phone. I dialed the police. The call rang. Someone rattled the handle.

I crawled into the closet, pulled the doors shut, pressed my hand to my mouth so my breathing wouldn’t give me away. Footsteps moved around the apartment. Something fell. He was inside.

I’m sitting here now, between my coats, knees pressed to my chest, praying he doesn’t open the closet door.
