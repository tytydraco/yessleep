Birds whistle, wind blows agale and trees rustle in the autumn breeze. Leaves fall off all the trees as peace waves across the landscape. I live in a wooden bungalow, lanterns light up my home with a warm, mellow burn. I have a large bedroom with a kitchen and small bathroom across the room. I hung for my own food yet recently the food has become more and more scarce, leading me to have to stay out a few hours later on some nights for enough meat to go to bed full.

There are no natural predators and no hunters would come here as this forest isn't known for its food but more for its lushious scenery. I've been looking out for whatever may be killing off my prey, but, to no avail. I, two nights ago when this begun, was out with a sniper rifle. I bent my knees to hide in hopes none of my prey sees me but it was practically useless. I found a decently large rabbit which could keep me fed for tonight and possibly tommorow morning aswell. I placed the sniper over my knee and closed one eye, aiming for the back of the skull. As I was about to pull down on the trigger, I heard frantic rustles behind me.

I re-opened my eye, turning to my right incase this was some sort of wolf or other dangerous animal. I found nothing. I quickly turned back for the kill and the rabbit was gone. "God damni-" just as I wanted to finish my sentence, I heard my name. "Paul... Paul please help..." I was confused as I lived alone and had no alive family who could of come to see me. I also didn't recognise the voice but an unknown feeling lured me to go and help. It sounded like a young girl so if it wasn't just my mind playing tricks in frustration, I could help her and get her to safety. I stood up, beginning to walk towards the direction I heard the voice. "Paul... please..." What? I heard the voice from behind me yet it came from the right last time.

I second guessed myself thinking it was my mind. I began to walk back home as the sunset made the sky grow orange, rivers rushing and flowing freely while leaves crunched as I took each step. I got into bed hoping I was just hearing things and the river may of messed up my hearing. I put out my lantern and tried sleeping but tossed and turned in hunger. I eventually fell asleep.

Yesterday was as normal but when I went hunting yet again, I couldn't find any animals whatsoever. Not even small instects or birds in the sky. I continued walking around, not worried about getting lost as I've lived her for 16 years and know each tree like the palm of my hand. As I finally came across a small squirrel, I groaned in annoyance as though it wasn't nothing, it still wasnt much and I haven't eaten meat in the past day and have been eating fruit and crops. I aimed my rifle yet again, prepared to shoot yet again but I once again heard my name. "Paul..." I yet again wanted to look for the source but this time ignored it in hunger for some food. As I missed my first shot, the squirrel began to run across the dirt and I knew it was no use. 

I arose, wanting to find the voice yet again. I began to search knowing it wasnt just my mind. It began to grow dark so I lit a match to see clearer. As I walked, it began to rain and quickly turned into heavy hail as my match was put out. I rolled my eyes in annoyance and started to walk back home. "Paul. Help me." The voice sounded much deeper then previously, like a fully grown man was forcing his voice to sound intimidating. I stood, frozen in shock but quickly started running the moment I saw them. Tens of hundreds of white, glowing eyes stared me down as they grew closer, edging towards me.

I shut my door behind me as a bang crashed against it, multiple screams echoed the air. "Come outside Paul, we can't play inside..." I ran into my bedroom, locking the door and grabbing my machete for protection yet I doubted it would do anything. " We can't come inside, come out to play..." This made me feel comfort as by now they could of broken inside so for whatever reason they probably couldn't do so. I'm writing this now as a final goodbye to this world as I don't think they will leave in the morning. If I survive, I'll update when I get the chance.
