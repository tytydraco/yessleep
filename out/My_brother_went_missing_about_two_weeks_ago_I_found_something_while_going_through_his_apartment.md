Hey guys, I don't know where to talk about this. If anywhere, this would probably receive the best attention with what's happening. Everyone who has heard this has just said my brother was going crazy and relapsed, but I know my brother—hell, he has a Ph.D. in marine geophysics and oceanographic engineering—he's been sober since our dad died in 1984. I won't lie; he was a bit of a junkie for a time. When Dad died, he sobered up. At 19, he got a job to help Mom and me with the bills and started to get his life together. He even got into a local college and eventually transferred to a more prestigious one, thanks to Mom. I was so proud of him for all he'd done. He'd never return to how he was before, let alone over 30 years later. I'm getting sidetracked; I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't believe that he relapsed and just disappeared like my mom does. My brother, Isaac, was last seen on April 18th as he entered his apartment building, and no one saw him leave. I won't pretend to understand a police investigation. Still, they didn't let me into his apartment for the last 12 days. I finally got a call from one of the detectives investigating my brother's disappearance, who told me to come to his apartment so that I could collect some of his belongings and discard what my mother and I didn't want. His landlord mentioned he hadn't paid rent for the last 2 months. He was going to find new tenants.

Walking into my brother's apartment felt weird, as I hadn't been there before. He had moved away from my mother and me over a year ago, and with a newborn, I hadn't been able to get away to visit him until now. It was a decent-sized place, with two bedrooms, one bathroom, and a small living room and kitchen. My brother only used the living room, which was odd, but it was his space. Going through the box from drawer to drawer, I found pictures of my mom and me, as well as some photos of him and two others: a man and a woman, in front of a large boat. I can only assume they were friends or colleagues. It took me a day and a half to box everything up in the apartment; I hadn't found anything of note in the living room; after loading the final box into my car, I went back to the apartment for one final look through, finding nothing in the rooms I decided to go to the bathroom before leaving, and that's when I noticed something weird his bathtub was covered in there weird markings—not going to say ritual symbols or something, but this is something id see in a sci-fi movie or some demon summoning ritual looking around the bathroom I noticed a small voice recorder no bigger than an iPod Nano peeking out behind the back of the toilet; the screen was cracked, and the battery was dead. I decided to charge it when I returned to my hotel and listened to the recording before heading home the next morning. Below is the transcription of the only thing recorded.

*(Recovered Tape—Labeled "PLAY IF I'M GONE")*

\[**Begin recording.**\]

*(A hiss of static. The faint hum of electrical interference. (A deep inhale.)*

**ISAAC (whispering):**

Okay… this is Dr. Isaac Holloway. If you're listening to this, I've probably vanished, or I'm not *me* anymore. Either way, you have to listen. You have to understand what's happening before it spreads.

I'm recording this because I don't know how long I have left. My thoughts… they're not my own. Not fully. It's like… like someone else is in here with me. Watching. Whispering.

God. Okay. Deep breath.

It started with the *Nereus-9* dive. The official reports say I was alone when they pulled me out, that the instruments failed, that there was no valid data, and that I was the only survivor. These are lies. Perhaps they didn't witness what I observed.

Three of us were Dr. Elara Voss, Luis Reyes, and I. We were sent to investigate a sonar anomaly near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It looked artificial, too symmetrical—an octagon the size of a city block, hidden ten thousand meters below the surface.

It wasn't a trench. It was a *structure*. Black metal made the structure seamless. It seemed as if it wasn't built, but rather grown. We sent in drones. One entered a tunnel—obsidian smooth walls, humming with… something. Not energy. Not radio. It felt… alive.

Then, the drones went dark. Instruments glitched. The pressure readings stopped making sense. That's when the low hum started. Low. Steady. The sensation is akin to breathing through a stone.

That night, we dreamed of it.

The city beneath. Miles wide. Spires and towers are built from coral, bone, and *something else*. A sphere sits in the center. Inside it—something is *waiting*. Not sleeping. Not dead. *Dreaming*.

Elara was the first to crack. She started drawing the symbols we saw inside. Glyphs like spirals and veins. They were said not to be a language, but rather a thought. A frequency. We stated that our purpose wasn't exploration. We were there to be… *accepted*.

Luis walked out of the sub. No suit. He smiled as if he had seen heaven. Pressure killed him in an instant. Elara didn't flinch.

She just whispered, “He’s gone home."

After that, I started seeing things, even when I was awake: shadows that didn't belong, movements in reflections, whispers in the water tank. The sub itself began to breathe.

Then Elara opened the final hatch. The water should've rushed in. But it didn't. Time froze. My heartbeat *stopped*. Something entered my body.

It wore a human shape. But it wasn't human. Its skin resembled ink, and its eyes resembled collapsing stars. It didn't speak. It just looked at me. *Inside me.* I felt it rummaging through my head like it was opening drawers.

Then—I woke up.

Alone.

No water. No, Elara. No, Luis. There was no visible trace of the structure. Everything wiped. They pulled me out of the Nereus, drifting just below the surface, claiming I'd hallucinated everything. But I didn't.

I couldn't have.

The signal followed me back.

I hear it now in the radiator. The debris ends up in the drain. It gets stuck in my teeth when I bite down too hard. It's *here*. The glyphs are on my skin, under it. I dream in spiral tunnels. I see them in reflections that aren't mine. My phone vibrates without calls. My faucet bleeds black water.

And the hum…

It's getting louder.

Last night, I looked into the bathtub drain, and *something blinked back*. The signal isn't coming from the ocean anymore.

It's *coming from my apartment*.

I don't think it ever let me go.

I think I'm just a vessel now. A mouth. A *transmitter*.

And if I'm right…

If I'm right, the present is only the beginning.

Do you think we've discovered something down there?

But we didn't.

**It discovered us.**

\[**END OF RECORDING.**\]

I don't know what to think after listening to this. It's my brother, for sure, no doubt about it; I've never heard him with so much conviction in his voice before. It sounds unbelievable, but the situation is genuinely confusing. Could he have just had a mental break from the trauma of losing his college, and this was the story his mind came up with? I have no idea.

This is the next morning after I listened to the recording. I just took a shower to calm myself and approach the recording with a fresh and clear mind. I don't remember the shower making a light humming sound last night, but it was likely a coincidence. I need your guys' thoughts on this: what should I do? I've contacted my brother's employer, but they consistently refuse to provide any information about his actions over the past month. Right now, I have no information to rely on; this post feels like a desperate attempt to know what happened at this point.
