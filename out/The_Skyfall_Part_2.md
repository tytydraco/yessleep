[The Skyfall Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/t1g6eYLwzk)

Hello again.

I don’t know if anyone is actually reading this.

The last post got 16 upvotes. No comments. Not a single reply, not even some hollowed-out attempt at reassurance. Just a number. 

Either no one has anything to say, or the comments won’t go through. Maybe the internet isn’t dead, not completely, but it’s been gutted, its insides picked clean. Maybe whatever ghosts still lurk in the wires are filtering words like bone from broth, stripping them down, leaving only husks behind.

A number is simple, a number.

But a voice? A voice is a lifeline. A voice is proof.

Maybe a voice is too much.

Or maybe I really am whispering into the corpse of a world.

But I have to believe someone saw it.

Because if I let go of that—if I let myself think, even for a second, that I am speaking to no one—then what’s left?

The land is still rising. The earth is peeling itself upward in layers, swallowing what was built over it, undoing every attempt to carve it into something unnatural. 

The roads are vanishing beneath moss and stone, breaking apart like old scabs. The highways have broken into ravines, veins of molten silver running through the cracks like liquid mercury. The cities—the ones still standing—are listing sideways, sinking, their bones too rigid to bend with the shift.

Every day, the world takes back more of itself.

And Hawthorn and I build higher.

Because if we don’t, we will be swallowed too.

There is no moon anymore.

At night, the sky is bare—just an expanse of black. The stars are there, but they feel thinner, like light stretched too far over a void much too deep.

Then morning comes, and the sun rises—too bright. It hangs in the sky like an exposed nerve, the light clinical, lacking the warmth it used to carry. The shadows it casts are too crisp, like there is no atmosphere left to soften them. It makes everything feel brittle, as if the whole world has been overexposed, one wrong move away from splintering apart.

The Skyfall, as we’ve started calling it, hasn’t stopped. The moon’s remains still drift in slow descent, twisting midair into fire, wind, and ruin. Some shards burn out before they reach the ground. Others don’t. 

The land continues to rise—not in quakes, not in explosions of rock, but in slow hunger. It swells beneath us, reclaiming itself piece by piece.

We shouldn’t be here.

The old world—the one we paved and poisoned and choked beneath steel and concrete—doesn’t exist anymore.

Hawthorn, on the other hand, worked like a man with a wind-up key at his back. Every movement was a rhythm, a function of necessity—cut, lift, hammer, repeat. No wasted breath, just the steady percussion of survival. His sleeves were shoved up past his elbows, forearms streaked with dirt and sawdust, hands raw from rope and wood and the refusal to stop. Sweat gathered at his temples, darkening the edges of his hair, but he didn’t pause to wipe it away. His jaw was clenched in that way it always was when he was thinking but not talking.

The second floor was starting to take shape.

A frame, a foundation, something resembling a future—not the kind we’d planned for, but the kind we had now. He was reinforcing the outer beams, securing what would be the walls once we had enough tarp and scavenged wood to seal them in. 

We were climbing as the earth rose beneath us, a game of height and hunger, of fighting to stay above the ground before it decided we belonged to it.

I watched him for a long moment, then exhaled. “Take a break.”

He didn’t. Of course he didn’t.

The hammer came down in another sharp crack, another nail driven deep.

“You’re gonna burn out,” I muttered, dragging myself up from where I was securing a tarp to the railing. My body protested, still sluggish and sore, but I ignored it. The pain was an old companion by now. My muscles burned, my hands ached, my ribs were tight with the pressure of milk that had nowhere to go. 

The thought lodged itself in my throat. 

Hawthorn finally set the hammer down, exhaling through his nose. He swiped his wrist across his forehead, then gave me a look. “You’re telling me to take a break?”

Fair. I hadn’t really stopped either. Sleep didn’t come easy. 

My body still expected to wake up for her, to answer her cries, to hold and feed and comfort her. But there was no cries. 

Just that constant feeling—like I’d left the oven on, like I’d misplaced my keys, like I was missing a limb but could still feel the ghost of it.

I nodded toward the small pack of supplies near the ladder. “You eat, I eat.”

Hawthorn smirked, the expression small but real. “That an order?”

“Damn right it is.”

He huffed a laugh, shaking his head, then crossed the half-built floor to grab the pack. He sank down next to me, the wood creaking beneath his weight, and dug through our rations—mostly canned goods and whatever dried food we’d salvaged. He tossed me a pack of jerky and a bottle of water, then cracked open a can of beans with his pocketknife.

For a moment, we just sat.

The wind sifted through tree branches, carrying with it the distant sound of something collapsing, something breaking apart in the ruins below. The world wasn’t done changing yet. The land was still rising, still shifting, still consuming. But for now, we were above it.

Hawthorn chewed, swallowed, then spoke. “You think she’s still in the NICU?”

I didn’t answer immediately. I wasn’t sure what answer I wanted.

Instead, I looked out over what remained of the world—the skeletal remains of buildings swallowed by earth, the distant glow of molten scars where the moon had punctured through the crust, the way the sky stretched on without its missing piece. I thought of the last post I made, of the hollow 16 upvotes and the silence that followed.

“Yeah,” I murmured. “I do.”

And then, quieter—almost too quiet to hear: “I just don’t know if I want her to be.”

Hawthorn handed me a strip of jerky and a bottle of water, the plastic cool against my palm. I twisted off the cap and took a sip.

“Saw something move earlier,” he said, breaking the quiet.

I paused mid-chew. The jerky was tough, the salt biting against my tongue. “Move?”

He nodded toward the horizon, where the land had begun to rise into something unrecognizable, hills swollen with silver scars, roads twisted into jagged veins. “Not the land. Something on it.”

I followed his gaze, searching past the distant ruins, the glint of something metallic embedded in the shifting terrain. The world was still eating itself, digesting the things we built, spitting out something new. But for all the movement, for all the change, it had been empty. No birds. No animals. No bodies. Just us and the wind, and the groaning of the earth reshaping itself beneath our feet.

“Animal?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

Hawthorn shook his head. “Too big. Too fast.”

A slow, creeping unease settled beneath my ribs. We hadn’t seen another living person since the first night. Not since the moon shattered, not since the first fragments speared through the cities like divine execution. It was just us and the land, breathing in what was left.

But I’d wondered—if the earth was reclaiming itself, if it was shedding our structures like old skin, then what else was it bringing back?

“You think there’s others out there?” I asked, keeping my voice even.

Hawthorn didn’t answer right away. He unscrewed the water bottle, took a slow sip, rolled his shoulders like he was shaking something off. 

“Wouldn’t surprise me.”

I tore off another piece of jerky, chewing slow.

For a while, we ate in silence. 

The kind that felt wrong. Because how could we sit here, side by side, passing water and rationing food, while the world remade itself beneath us? How could I swallow while city blocks vanished, while roads turned to ravines, while the trees swallowed the remnants of steel and bone?

How could I sit here, eating dried meat and stale crackers, while my daughter lay somewhere far below, in a place that might not exist anymore?

I closed my eyes. Exhaled.

Hawthorn shifted beside me, gaze still fixed on the horizon.

“You ever wonder if we were supposed to make it?” he asked. His voice was much quieter than before.

I swallowed, throat tight. “What do you mean?”

He exhaled through his nose, tapping his fingers once against his knee. “Just—if the land’s taking back what’s owed… why are we still here?”

I didn’t have an answer for that.

So I just looked out at the horizon, at the swollen, shifting land, at the silver glint of something I couldn’t quite make sense of.

And I kept chewing.

Hawthorn tossed the last piece of jerky into his mouth, chewing slow, eyes distant. Below us, the world shifted in quiet hunger, the land rising inch by inch, swallowing what it was owed. The tree we had made our home trembled with it, roots gripping soil that no longer wanted to hold steady.

“We need a plan,” I said finally, pressing the heel of my hand into my forehead. The exhaustion was creeping in, threading itself into my skull, but I forced myself to sit straighter, to stay sharp.

Hawthorn stretched his legs out in front of him, leaning back on his palms. “We have a plan.”

I scoffed. “Climbing is not a plan. It’s a stalling tactic.”

He raised a brow. “And you got a better idea?”

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to tell him I had some genius revelation, some secret trick, some way out. But I didn’t.
So instead, I sighed, rubbed my temple, and muttered, “I just don’t want to die in a goddamn treehouse, man.”

Hawthorn chuckled—an actual laugh, a rare thing, something small but warm in the cold wreckage of our world. “Yeah,” he said. “Me neither.”

We watched the horizon as we finished eating, the sky vast and empty. Where the moon should have been, there was only absence—a hollow, yawning nothingness. No stars. Just the dark. And beneath it, the monoliths of moonrock loomed.

My skin prickled. The wind twisted around us, a breath too intentional, too present. I swore it was whispering.

I shook it off, pushed forward. “Okay, so what happens when we run out of tree?”

Hawthorn was quiet for a moment. Then, he wiped his hands on his jeans and exhaled through his nose. “We build past it.”

I gave him a look. “And attach it to what, exactly? The sky?”

“No.” He nudged his chin toward the closest structure still standing—a water tower, its metal frame warped but intact, stretching above the ruins of a drowned town. 

“That.”

I stared at it, chewing the inside of my cheek.

It wasn’t a terrible idea. If the ground was rising, then anything left standing would be worth climbing. The water tower had height, metal we could reinforce, an actual foundation—one not dependent on something that was still alive and could still fail us.

“We’d have to get to it first,” I said.

Hawthorn nodded. “Yeah.”

“And it’s, what? Fifty yards away? Over rising land and God knows what else?”

“Yeah.”

I groaned, raking a hand through my hair. Bad plan. Risky as hell. But if we wanted to keep breathing, we needed something better than ‘just keep climbing.’

I bit my lip. “We’d need a bridge.”

Hawthorn smirked. “Now you’re thinking.”

I ignored the warmth in my chest, the brief flicker of something almost like hope. “What do we even have for that?”

“We can reinforce the platform here first. Make it wide enough to balance the extension. Then we salvage. Take wood from wherever we can get it, find metal where we can. Build in sections so we don’t waste material.” He tapped his fingers against his knee, already deep in thought. “We could use tension cables if we find any. If not, rope lashing, angled supports—hell, even sheets of metal for stability.”

I stared at him. “How the hell do you just know this?”

Hawthorn gave me a dry look. “I’m a carpenter, Heather.”

“Yeah, but—treehouses. Cabinets. Cool bookshelves. Not—” I waved vaguely at the apocalypse around us. “This.”

He huffed a laugh. “Building is building. Same principles apply. Just… bigger stakes.”

Bigger stakes. That was one way to put it.

I swallowed, looking at the water tower again, at the way it stood against the sky like the last stubborn thing refusing to fall.

I nodded. “Alright.”

Hawthorn pushed himself up, already reaching for his tools. “Then we start now.”

I don’t know if I’ll be able to post again. The power here is unstable, something Hawthorn and I have been trying to patch together with whatever solar scraps we could find. We’re siphoning what little connection still crawls through the veins of dead cities. I don’t know if it will hold.

But if anyone out there is still listening—if anyone out there sees this—

We’re making our way higher.

We’re building.

And the land is still coming.
