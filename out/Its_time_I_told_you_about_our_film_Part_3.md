The next couple of days, we managed to shoot a few scenes. It almost felt like a real movie set, for once. Our schedules were on-time and there was a steady stream of supporting actors being brought in. If this was the only period of filming you’d seen, you might think it was like any other project. But for those of us in-the-know, we knew most of this was all surface. Like the lead actress. No matter what she sounded like, or moved like, or looked like, we all knew the truth – that *wasn’t* Dawn Andersen.

But what the hell were we supposed to do? Everyone was just acting like nothing had happened. Hell, even Seb didn’t seem to know how to act, and he was the only person in there that I could 100% trust.

I’d managed to compartmentalize much of what’d happened those first few days, treating it as if it was something that’d happened to someone else. But as with so many other things, normalcy came and went like a pendulum; and it was about to swing pretty far in the other direction.

&nbsp;

In the script, the next location was just called “A Blue House”. The house itself was supposed to be insignificant; the focus of the scene was the action of the characters. It was supposed to be this really tense scene where the heroine had found a large wooden chest, rumored to contain the bones of an unholy prophet. Sort of like an anti-saint. The house itself was supposed to be a sort of backdrop. Just “A Blue House”.

She would slowly approach, walking from room to room, speaking to the spirit of the prophet in a dead language. Finally, the chest was supposed to slowly open. That was the planned scene.

&nbsp;

We had an actual house for this scene, down by the coast. Director Hampton wanted a real house with a view of the coastline. However, when Seb and I was brought on to set up the interior lighting, we could tell there were issues. Constant delays, where runners and set designers had to fix and tinker with the interior. Half the day passed and we hadn’t put up a single light.

Seb wasn’t impressed. Things had been going well for a few days, and this just ground his enthusiasm to a halt. We spent most of the afternoon sitting by the cliffside, listening to music, and sharing a pack of cigarettes. That’s the clearest picture I have in my mind from that day.

“I gotta ask,” I remember saying. “Why are you so eager to keep this job?”

Seb flicked the ash of his cigarette, nodding to himself. Finally, he shrugged at me.

“Got a kid on the way,” he said. “This is probably the last set I can work out-of-state before I get locked down.”

“You’re having a kid?”

“Yeah.”

That was the first time I imagined Seb Digman as a parent. It changed him, somehow.

&nbsp;

By nightfall, they gave up. The director had a long chat with some of his inner circle and sent most people home. The only ones who were allowed to stick around were those who the director deemed “trustworthy”. Both Seb and I were in. Maybe it wasn’t so much a matter of trust as it was desperation.

As we saw wave after wave of people leaving the set, the shadows grew longer. Seb and I watched as some of the folks who’d been toiling for hours finally got to rest, and we were tasked to pick up their slack.

We’d seen people wander in and out of the house all day with these cheap metal buckets, armed with little hammers that we used to nail down power cables. You don’t want a loose cable to drift into view on-set. That was pretty much all the equipment they'd used.

&nbsp;

It was strange. All they did was walk in, hammer a little, and come out with a bucket full of white pebbles. Then they’d toss it over the edge of the cliffside, go back in, and do it all over again. They looked like miners, only without the pickaxes and safety helmets.

I’d just finished eating a pre-packaged cheese and ham sandwich when I got a tap on my shoulder. One of the sound guys handed me his bucket and hammer, wiping the sweat off his brow.

“You’re up,” he wheezed. “Go see Hampton.”

So I did.

&nbsp;

The director, Roy Hampton, had been busy all day. It was rare to see him do anything but make loud demands, or point out details that needed to be changed. Now he was just sitting there, on a bench across from the house, flipping through a copy of the script with a marker pen. The lead actress was nowhere to be seen.

As I approached, he looked me up and down, before turning his attention back to the script.

“Did they tell you what to do?” he asked.

“No.”

“We need to clear the house,” he continued. “For the shoot.”

“Clear it of what?”

Without looking up, he tapped the side of my bucket.

“Teeth.”

&nbsp;

I was given a few more instructions for clarification. For example, I wasn’t allowed to touch or move the wooden chest prop. Furthermore, I had to look everywhere; behind the furniture, under the carpets; anywhere and everywhere. I was to use the hammer, and not pull them out with my hands. I could not keep any of the teeth. Once they were out of the wall, however, it was fine to touch them if necessary.

But it didn’t make sense to me. Obviously, “teeth” was a joke. But that didn’t answer what the hell those white pebbles were. And having them thrown out by the bucketload meant there had to be tons of them inside.

Why the hell did we pick that location to begin with?

&nbsp;

It was me, Seb, and two runners, who stepped in. An old house, made sometime in the 1920’s. Tight corridors, thin wooden walls, creaky floors. Curled blue wallpaper. Seb insisted that the whole house was tilting slightly, but I couldn’t feel it. Wouldn’t surprise me if it did though.

Stepping into the living room, there was only one item that looked out of place; a massive wooden box, smack dab in the middle of the floor. It was as if everything in the room had been moved to accommodate for that one box. I thought the team had done a great job making it; it really looked like some old ceremonial thing. It seemed to be nailed to the floor.

Seb wasn't convinced though. He leaned down, dragging his hand along the side of the box. He looked up at me with blackened fingertips. His expression changed.

“This is *real* patina,” he said. “This thing is old. Real-real kind of old.”

&nbsp;

One of the runners were the first to find something. He called us over.

It was underneath the kitchen sink. He lit it up with a flashlight, inviting us to take a look for ourselves. The others kneeled, one by one. No one said a thing. Finally, it was my turn. Even then, I was still expecting some kind of salt or calcium buildup. Something you might see in an old house.

But it was **teeth**. Actual teeth. Just like we’d been told.

It was molars. Most of them small, like the nail of a pinky finger. Others were the size of a thumb. There was at least two dozen of them.

There was this stunned silence as we all tried to process this. For some reason, my eyes drifted back to Seb. He was the only one looking not at the teeth, but at the box in the middle of the room. Noticing me looking at him, he nodded towards it.

“You know,” he said. “I’m starting to think that ain’t a prop.”

&nbsp;

There were two floors in total. We could find teeth in every single room, if we looked close enough. Inside the fireplace on the bottom floor. On the side of the stairs. Under, and on, the carpets. Seb found a couple teeth hanging from the goddamn chandelier.

The first tooth I knocked out was one of the most visceral things I’ve ever felt. There was like a wet flesh-textured hole left in the wall that slowly closed. There was a warmth, and a wetness, to every single tooth – as if someone was breathing into my face with every tooth removed. Every clink of a tooth falling into my metal bucket sent a shiver down my spine.

We probably went at it for an hour before we’d filled our first bucket. One by one, we went outside, dumping it all over the edge of the cliff. Looking over at the director, he didn’t seem to have a care in the world; laughing it up with some of the folks from the costume department.

&nbsp;

Going back in, we had trouble finding more teeth. It wasn’t until about fifteen minutes later when we realized that most of the places where we had already looked had **new** teeth growing in. Most of them tiny, but they were there. Even up in the chandelier.

“What’s the point?” Seb sighed. “If it keeps coming back, what’s the point?”

“Maybe it stops,” one of the runners said. “Like, after a while.”

“What makes you think that?” I asked.

The other runner, a guy named Merle, pulled one of the teeth out with his bare hands, stuffing it into his pocket.

“I’m keeping one,” he said. “Ain’t no way anyone’ll believe me if I don’t.”

&nbsp;

We spent the next three hours knocking teeth out and throwing them over the edge of the cliff. All the while, finding more teeth all over, no matter how many times we got rid of them.

By the fourth bucketload, the director stopped us at the door. He went along with us inside.

“It’s useless,” Seb tried to tell him. “There’re too many.”

“I got it now,” the director assured us. “We’re fixing this.”

&nbsp;

We stepped back inside and walked straight up to the wooden box. Using his cigar cutter, the director cut a small wound into his thumb and smeared a bloody circle across the top of the box. The rest of us didn’t say anything. This wasn’t the strangest thing we’d seen him do, but it was up there.

He handed me his script; now with a bloody thumbprint.

“Read what’s marked in yellow.”

Flipping through the pages, the only things marked in yellow were certain nonsense words. They were the words of the spoken off-screen entity, the corrupting influence that the heroine tries to resist throughout the movie.

“I… I can’t pronounce any of this,” I said. “What’s this? Rao? Roe? Rio?”

“You can’t say it wrong,” the director added. “Just say it how you... feel it should be said.”

I looked up at Seb. He just shook his head.

&nbsp;

“Rao soma Eo,” I spoke aloud. “Drin soma Eo.”

Roy nodded, waiting as I flipped through the pages. The marked words were few and far-between; a mix of various spoken lines.

“Stroe soma Eo,” I continued. “Haughin soma Eo.”

&nbsp;

Then, something happened. The words started to make sense to me. Not just the way they were supposed to be spoken, but their innate meaning. But it wasn’t just words, they were experiences. Pictures. They made me think of distant places, and foreign smells. Pictures of blue fabric, blowing in the night wind. Fine salt under my fingernails. A great fire.

Then, without noticing, I didn’t have the script in my hands anymore. The director took it back. Everyone just looked at me, slack-jawed and confused. There was a more intricate pattern on the box now, but you could barely tell. The wood was too dark; masking the dry blood.

“I think we’re done,” director Hampton said. “They should be gone by morning.”

“What… what exactly did we do?” asked Seb. “What is this?”

“You think you’d understand that explanation?” he smiled. “Or would you even want to, for that matter?”

Seb sighed, drawing a breath into a new cigarette.

“Fuck no."

&nbsp;

The next day, filming resumed. There were no more issues with the house, and we were able to set up our equipment within the hour. We were done just after lunch, quickly moving on to some environmental shots by the cliffside. It’s as if the previous day had never happened.

I was pretty out of it though. I hadn’t slept well. Every time I started to slip into a dream, I had this panicked feeling of not being able to get back out; like stepping off the deep end of a pool when you can’t swim. I couldn’t allow myself to fall into a deep sleep; instead dipping in and out of semi-consciousness until the early hours of the morning.

I kept thinking about those **words**. Seeing them. Feeling them. Knowing them.

I remember looking out over the cliffside, feeling a stiff breeze ruffle my hair, when Seb tapped me on the shoulder.

“You okay?” he asked.

“Slept like shit,” I sighed.

“Me too,” he said, sipping his coffee.

Seb looked down at the rest of the crew, still packing up from one of the beach shots. They looked so small from up there.

“You seen Merle today?” he asked. “The runner?”

“Nah,” I yawned. “Probably slept in.”

Seb shook his head.

“No. He didn’t.”

&nbsp;

We were kept busy all day long, but we kept an eye out. Neither of us managed to catch a glimpse of Merle, and no one seemed to know anything. There were still people running about back at the warehouse, but most were accounted for on-site. It was worrisome. I’d seen enough to know that people were expendable at this point.

We came back as the sun started to set. The late-night get-togethers and mini-parties had been replaced with a whole crew faceplanting into their pillow simultaneously. Having lost all sleep from the other night, I was barely standing. I was out cold in a matter of minutes.

&nbsp;

This time, I could dream – but not without twisting, turning, and waking at random. I kept getting these intrusive thoughts in my head; that I had to go for a run, or drink scolding hot water, or rub sand against my shinbones. Just these weird physical sensations that I had sudden urges to pursue. I didn’t, of course, but I couldn’t stop myself from feeling it.

When my mind finally settled into a singular dream, it was surprisingly real. It felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. I imagined myself walking around the set, browsing the dark shelves and running my hand across the cold metal. I could hear my footsteps as I made my way back to my bed; going back to sleep even there and then, in my own mind.

Only when I got back, someone was already in my bed.

**Me**.

&nbsp;

The moment I woke up, I was staring into a stranger’s eyes.

One green eye, one red. A rattled breath, struggling for air.

It took me a moment to realize that it wasn’t them having trouble breathing.

It was me.

I was being *strangled*.

&nbsp;

There was this slow buildup of panic in my chest as I came to. It was as if my heart was trying to beat faster, but the blood couldn’t reach my head.

Still, looking back at it, what I remember most isn’t the neutral expression of my attacker, or the cold fingers around my neck. What I remember most is something sharp poking into my skin; as if they were holding a handful of gravel and pressing it against me. I was hyper-focusing on these nonsensical little things, as if I couldn’t understand what was really happening.

My hand flopped to the side of the bed, my fingertips growing numb. I could feel my biceps losing strength. Grabbing something out of my bedside pants, I brought my hand up towards my attacker, and flicked my thumb.

&nbsp;

I’d managed to grab my lighter. I burned them straight in their red eye.

&nbsp;

I didn’t even realize how much I needed to breathe until I managed to get them off of me. I pushed myself away and felt the chemicals in my body come loose. Blood rushing to my head and muscles, kicking me into action.

I wanted to scream for help, but all that came out was this useless whimper; my throat’d been hurt. Instead, I backed away, readied myself to run, and watched my attacker step into the moonlight.

Merle, the runner.

His left hand was *covered* in teeth, going all the way up to his shoulder. More teeth, falling out of his mouth with every breath. Little holes building up on the side of his face, with early onset of more teeth poking through the skin. His eye had turned red from internal bleeding, as one of the teeth had grown out of the corner of his retina.

&nbsp;

In the moment, I abandoned all reason. From what I'd seen on-set, this was the most visceral and horrifying sight, by far. That night with Dawn, at the cave... at least they'd been human. But this? I couldn't tell what was happening here.

He shouldn't have taken that damn tooth.

&nbsp;

I wanted to turn to run, but he was matching my movements like a predator. A shift to the left. To the right. His eyes didn’t leave me. I backed away; he moved closer.

My instinct to try and talk him down was thrown out the window. This wasn’t a person that would listen to reason. All I had was my lighter, and a solid eight feet of distance.

I heard the tip-tap noises of little teeth falling off his arm. Like sand in an hourglass.

Then, he attacked.

&nbsp;

My folding bed was thrown across the room. His naked footsteps were heavy, leaving dozens of teeth behind. Despite that, he was fast. He came at me with all he had.

I grabbed the first thing I could use as a barrier. A door, leading me into the bathroom. I rushed inside, slamming the door shut. I felt him grabbing the handle from the other side, pulling with an impossible strength; but losing his grip with the loss of teeth slipping from the palm of his hand. I got just enough leverage to lock the door.

I stumbled backwards into a bathtub, pulling down the cheap blue fabric as I fell.

&nbsp;

Seconds later, the door started to give way. Wooden splinters scattered on the floor. I pulled down the shower rod, wrapped the curtain up, and set fire to it with my lighter; wielding it like a makeshift torch. Good thing it was cheap plastic, and that no one’d had the time to shower that night.

It felt… primal, in a way. Like a caveman waving off a hungry wolf. But this particular wolf didn’t seem all too bothered.

And with that, the door broke.

&nbsp;

It all happened so fast. I remember hearing myself trying to scream, but just managing a wheeze. I pushed the shower rod into his chest like a spear, but it barely budged him - scraping against surface-level teeth. A tooth-covered fist swung towards me, cracking the ceramic tiles next to me as he missed; instead hitting the light switch. It turned this waking nightmare into a shadow play. Vague gestures and silhouettes cast by moonlight.

A red eye. A mouth with oversized teeth. Tip-taps of teeth hitting ceramic tiles.

And still, I couldn’t scream.

&nbsp;

Managing to duck under a second swing, I used his momentum to get past, and back out into the mess hall. I ran towards the back, where I could pass into the warehouse – but I didn’t get far. Merle threw something heavy at me, hitting me just over the shoulder. I fell forward, completely losing my balance, knocking something over from the counter. He'd ripped out a piece of the sink.

Landing palms-first into a spilled pile of table salt, I rolled over to see Merle approaching. Parts of the shower curtain still smoldered on his shoulder. He had picked up the shower rod, wielding it like a club.

He was going to beat me to death.

&nbsp;

For a moment, the impressions of the day flashed before my eyes. The teeth in the walls. The cliffside chat with Seb. The nonchalant attitude of director Hampton.

And the strange words. The images that’d flashed within my mind. The words that had crept into the back of my head and settled there, coloring the inside of my mind with foreign pictures.

And suddenly, it started to make sense.

&nbsp;

The blue fabric, blowing in the wind from an open window. That was the shower curtain.

The salt under my fingernails. It was right there.

But there was no great fire. Only a sputtering flame on his shoulder.

&nbsp;

“It’s wrong,” I muttered, as Merle approached. “It’s wrong. There should…”

The words came to me. Clear, vivid, and eager. I’ll never forget them. I can’t.

*Rao soma Eo. Drin soma Eo.*

*Stroe soma Eo. Haughin soma Eo.*

&nbsp;

By the last syllable, it was as if something in the air corrected itself. Maybe it was just a coincidence. A freak wind. But another part of me felt like the world was making something right.

A sputter from the flame got caught in his hair. Something flared up by the neck of his torn shirt. In the blink of an eye, he erupted into flame.

**A great fire.**

&nbsp;

The fire alarm screamed in my stead. I coughed on the black smoke as Merle fled outside. I could finally hear others waking up and stepping out of their trailers; but to them, all they saw was the fire. Merle was dead the moment he hit the ground. He was just a tangled mess of fabric and… something, to them.

I drew in a breath of nighttime air, feeling my throat relax. Someone was asking what the hell was going on. Someone else was screaming for help. But louder than any voice was the mere presence of Dawn Andersen – the lead actress. Standing at the edge of the fire with a robe wrapped around her, giving me a tired smile. She scooched closer, speaking just loud enough for others to hear.

&nbsp;

“Good thing you were here,” she smiled. “This could’ve burned down the entire warehouse.”

I didn’t answer. I just looked at her.

“Looks like some props didn’t make it, huh?” she continued.

&nbsp;

Now, we both had dirt on one another. She knew what I’d done to… “her”. That first night outside the cave. And I knew she wasn’t the real Dawn Andersen.

We were at an impasse.

“Looks… looks like I deserve a raise,” I wheezed.

“I’m sure Mr. Hampton agrees.”

They held a fireside applause for me. Someone pointed out the trail of teeth left behind, as if that somehow confirmed that it was just burning props. Someone else pointed to the vague shape of a skeletal hand in the flames; another sign of important props being lost.

But both Dawn and I knew what it really was.

Or rather, *who*, it really was.

&nbsp;

But we had a movie to make.
