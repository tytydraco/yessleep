A couple of days ago, I was night gazing as I usually do. A sense of calm wrapped around my consciousness as I gazed into the mindless void of emptiness in the sky. The crickets humming and the cold breeze gently pushing my hair often relax me when I’m burnt out after a long day of work. This night was perfectly normal, as usual. I lay back in the grass, letting my mind ease off into a numb state. I closed my eyes for a few seconds and was quickly engulfed in a sea of beaming lights obstructing my view. A gush of air violently pushed me back. A deafening tone screeched through my eardrums until everything went dark.

I awoke in a state of confusion and grogginess. Cold metal straps held me in place. I was strung up against a board, sitting upright. I quickly examined my surroundings. The entire room was lit with white LED lights, and an endless number of empty medical tables surrounded me. The bright lights twisted my stomach and made my head pound. I started to get overwhelmed, believing I must be hallucinating.

I turned my head to the left. I could see another person strung up, wearing a medical robe. She was gazing down, her brown, greasy hair consuming her entire face. I attempted to speak to her, letting out a simple “hello.” But my fear quickly intensified. I couldn’t hear myself. I didn’t even know if words were coming out of my mouth. I attempted to scream as loud as I could, begging for help. Nothing, fucking nothing. The feeling of screaming underwater is the best I could describe it. The endless void I always escaped to finally caught up to me, just not how I imagined it.

I sat there, strung up, for at least hours. I weirdly felt at peace during that time. I just dazed off into the endless loop of medical tables. I counted 127 medical tables laid out in front of me. The more I counted, the more they seemed to multiply. I was losing my sanity. The woman was still perched in the same position. I started to believe she could have been a statue or a wax figure of sorts.

When I peered off into the void of tables, I could see some sort of yellow sphere closing in on our location. My hair spiked up, and I began to feel a tingling sensation within my limbs. Everything in my body was shouting at me to run. My instincts took over. I started to shake violently, thrashing as hard as I could. The straps stayed firm, it was pointless. My mind and soul could sense the presence of a threat approaching, and fast. Fight or flight surely kicked in, but I couldn’t do either.

The yellow sphere finally exploded, instantly sending my eyes into a flash of white. As soon as my sight returned, all I could see was a figure phasing through the ceiling. The being was grotesque, accompanied by long, slender arms. It was completely hairless, with tight slits for eyes. It was dark grey but somehow kept phasing colors back and forth to a deep sea blue. Its body was unproportional for its size, utterly mind bending for me to comprehend. It slowly approached me, face to face. It had no mouth or nose, just small slits where the eyes should be. Its arms moved fast and robotic as it touched my face, observing every detail. It leaned in closer, inspecting behind my ear.

I tried to speak to the thing. No reaction. No acknowledgment. Just fucking silence. Its cold, slimy fingers grazed the back of my head. As soon as its fingers left me, I quickly shot my head toward the woman. It was already there, looking down at her. It was there almost instantly, compared to its slow approach toward me. Then, in one sharp, fluid movement, it gripped her hair. In the same motion, it brought her face into my view while twisting its glare toward me. Its eyes peeled open, showing a dark red glow staring back at me.

Then I saw the woman’s face. Words will truly never describe how contorted and disfigured her face was. Her mouth was on her forehead, her nose lay under her chin, and one of her eyes was on her cheek. I screamed, and I could feel my throat quenching in pain but still engulfed in silence. The worst fucking part of it all, she was still alive. I saw her blink a couple of times, tears flowing from the one eye that lay dormant on her cheek.

The thing was still staring at me, gaping somehow with a huge, disgusting smile. Its mouth appeared, sprouting bloody, pointy teeth, forming an inhuman grin directed at me. It darted toward me, now inches from my face. It pulled out a scalpel of some sort and a tiny black chip out of the air. My heart started to pump as I began to breathe rapidly. It twisted its head, its smile somehow getting larger. It was enjoying every single moment of my fear and worry. My mind and reality were shattered. I closed my eyes, hoping all of this was some twisted, fucked-up dream. I felt the scalpel cut deep behind my ear. Then I lost all consciousness.

I opened my eyes, back in the familiar place I was before this nightmare occurred. The cold breeze tingled against my skin. The hum of wildlife consumes my eardrums once again. The pressure and fear wiped clean from the slate. I went back inside my house and grabbed my phone. Only ten minutes had passed since I went outside. I believed in that moment that I had dreamt it all. I had no rational explanation for what occurred. I went on with my life for the next two days as normal. After the third day, on my way to work, my head furiously began to pound. The pain was unbearable to the point I had to call out sick. I could feel it. Something burrowing inside my head looking for a way out.

I checked the mirror, the pain and sorrow all rushed back to me. I could see a scar behind my ear. I didn’t want to believe it was true. It just had to be some fucked-up nightmare or figment of my imagination. The chip is in me. It’s changing me into something. All of the toes on my left foot are gone. They somehow went inside of me. I know it’s hard to explain, but it’s almost as if I absorbed them. I could feel the rest of my body preparing to convert.

I don’t know what I will become after this is done. I’ve become this sick science experiment for its enjoyment. I quit my job. I haven’t left the house. I’m just counting the days until I fully change. My sanity is falling out of my grasp as I stare at my reflection, unable to look away. I don’t know what I will become, but I know it’s not done with me.
