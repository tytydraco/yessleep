Hey wereddit. I've got a problem.

So I've been doing as you guys said -- putting together a decent kit and stalking my gf's first meal. Thanks for that, btw!! It cost less than I thought, and I only ended up needing the duct tape, sedative, and rubber gloves. I should post a pic sometime.

Anyway, the first meal I chose was this guy that bullied her while she was in high school. Fat sonofabitch didn't know what hit him lol, I had him rolled up in a rug before he could even react. I've been working out so I was able to lift him ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’ª hell yeah

So I put him in my truck and took him to a remote location, just like fur_wife548 suggested. My gf was already there, and was halfway shifted. Ngl it was kind of beautiful -- seeing her rip into her new skin like that. She was so strong and powerful. So many new muscles. ðŸ¥µ She was screaming and begging me to help her, though, which just about broke my heart.

So I offered her the body, like y'all said. And guys. When I say she freaked out, she FREAKED OUT. She started screaming shit at me, like "how could you do this?" and "you should've just let me die" and "you're a fucking murderer! I hate you!"

I know that she didn't mean any of this, but it still hurt to hear. I worked so hard for this, taking her to expensive restaurants, buying her everything she could ever want -- hell, I even met her parents. We've been incompatable sexually for a while because I'm not super into other humans, so I thought she could shift and hey, problem solved!

But no. She has to be difficult and start throwing shit at me when I try to keep her fed and alive. Ffs, I was so excited to watch. Not too big into gore but the sight of my gf ripping into another human being to protect me? soo hot. I've fantasized about it countless times, and she can't even let me have that.

I think she still hasn't settled into what her life is going to be like from now on. It's certainly thrown a wrench into my plans -- I already had another kill set up that I'll probably have to ditch now. I know I shouldn't complain but it sucks that she decided to act like this. I was really looking forward to it.

Idk. There are some days when I think I shouldn't have asked my friend to bite her in the first place. She still doesn't know that I was behind it, and I was planning on telling her after she fed. But now that's ruined too.

Any advice?? Pls I need my werewolf gf back. You guys make it all seem so easy -- I get to vent my feelings, she gets to eat. I hoped it might bring us closer together but now I'm afraid she's turning into a brat like my ex. My ex didn't even survive the change lol, weak bitch. I had hoped that this time would be different.

Oh well. Practice makes perfect :)
