Season 2

“You ready Bruce?”

“Ready as I’ll ever be.”

Except, I’m not ready. How can I be? I barely survived Season One. And the Season Finale was a disaster. The poor contestant was burned to a crisp. Smelled like barbecue chicken and rotten eggs.

“Quiet on the set!”

I suck in my gut.

“Going live in five… four… three… two…”

(Cue creepy music)

(Cut to camera one)

I get the nod.

“Hello out there, wherever you are. Welcome to Season Two of…”

(Cue audience)

“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”

(Cut to camera three)

I tease the audience.

“Alright, alright. Knock it off!”

I check my watch.

“My name is Bruce Davie, and I'm terrified...I mean... happy to be here. Alright, now that the formalities are over, lets bring out today’s contestant, shall we?”

Audience applauds.

(Cut to camera four)

A generous woman wearing yoga pants and a loose-fitting Lynyrd Skynyrd tee-shirt appears on screen. She fist-pumps across the stage.

I roll my eyes. Where do they find these people?

(Split screen)

“Tell us a bit about yourself, starting with who you are and where you’re from.” I look directly into the camera, raise an eyebrow. “But please, make it brief. We wouldn’t want to keep the Devil waiting, would we?”

The audience oohs and ahs.

The heavily tattooed woman shakes her head. 

“Good to be here, Bruce. I just love…”

She flaps her meaty arms in the air.

(Cue audience)

“LET’S MAKE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.”

I shake my head, then immediately straighten up. Mustn’t stray from the script. Maybe, just maybe, I can save her from a gruesome fate. 

(Cut to camera four)

“Name’s Bertha. Bertha Squires. Folks back home call me Big Bertha. I’m from the great state of Georgia. I like beers and barbecued ribs, and Lynyrd Skynyrd played real loud. And I loooove the Falcons. Let’s go Falcons!”

The audience cheers.

“Alright, alright,” I say, signalling the audience to simmer down. “Let’s get down to business, shall we? I do believe it’s time to…”

(Cue audience)

“BRING OUT THE DEVIL.”

(Cue creepy music)

The lights flicker. Minty fog stretches across the studio. An illuminated pentagram flashes above the audience, much to their delight.

My stomach sinks into my toes. I hate this part. Damion doesn’t take part in the rehearsals. He appears only when the camera’s are rolling. Although on occasion, his deep, guttural voice wafts from the producer’s office. Like today, when I overheard them discussing the future of the show. My name wasn’t mentioned.

Fire flashes across the stage.

Damion suddenly appears.

The audience gasps.

(Cut to camera three)

Closeup of Damion wearing his elaborate, skin-tight red devil suit. His leather tail swings confidently, as his glowing eyes burn into television screens and devices all across the world, keeping millions of viewers glued to the edges of their seats. On his head is a black fedora. He tilts it slightly so, then he extends an arm, hushing the audience.

“Good evening!”

The audience applauds.

Damion smiles slyly, showcasing his gold-tooth display.

“So, Bertha,” he exaggerates her name. “Let’s cut to the chase. Tell me… no tell the world… what it is you most desire?”

(Split screen)

The Devil sneers.

Bertha puffs out her chest.

“Well Damion, I want what every American wants.”

The audience leans in.

“Mo money!”

The audience jumps to their feet, cheering.

(Cut to camera one)

I see myself in the monitors. I seem so small and insignificant.

“Alright, alright,” I say shakily. “I’m sure Damion can manage that. After all, he IS the Devil.”

(Enter creepy music)

(Cut to camera three)

The Devil's grin sends chills coursing down my spine.

“Excellent,” he says, fiddling his fingers. “I can certainly arrange that.”

(Cut to camera four)

Bertha starts fist-pumping, to the audience’s delight.

“But first,” he sneers into the camera, “you must sign a contract. Then it's official.” 

He snaps his fingers, the sound ricochets across the studio like a thunderclap. Suddenly, he’s holding an ancient-looking contract made of human skin. I’ll be damned if the words aren’t written in blood. 

I shudder.

(Split screen)

Damion hands her the contract. 

The contestant places the parchment on to the pedestal; a pool of sweat glistens from her gleaming forehead.

Damion’s eyes sparkle like oceans of evil.

She winces as he touches her arm.

The Devil turns to the audience.

“Whatcha think?” His voice sounds like an ashtray. “Should Bertha be America’s next billionaire?”

“Hell yeah!” Bertha fist pumps, then raises her arms upwards. “Lord, let the money rain over me!”

The audience agrees.

I shrink into my shoes. Could this get any worse?

(Cut to camera four)

“Excellent.” Damion snaps his spidery fingers. Suddenly, he’s holding a quilted pen. “Sign here, here and….” He’s making a mockery of this. “Initial here.”

Cautiously, Bertha takes the pen.

“But read through it carefully. Because…”

(Cue audience)

“THE DEVIL’S IN THE DETAILS.”

Bertha’s round face turns scarlet. Her beady eyes show a mixture of terror and greed.

(Split screen)

The devil licks his lips.

The audience holds its breath.

The contract trembles in the contestant’s hands.

Yawning, Damion taps his Rolex, then gives the camera his million-dollar grin.

“Hurry it up, wouldya? We’re on live television!”

The audience chants: “SIGN IT... SIGN IT… SIGN IT…”

Close up of the contestant leaning over, about to sign.

“Uh uh.” Damion snaps his fingers; a bottle of ink appears.

The contestant dips the pen into the jar of red ink.

The audience rises to its feet.

The contestant signs the contract.

(Cut to camera one)

My game-show-host smile is stapled to my face.

“Well done, Bertha. You’ve just made a deal with the Devil!”

The audience goes ballistic.

(Camera pans out)

Grinning grotesquely, Damion flies above the audience, whose necks are stretched like cranes. 

(Close up of the Devil)

“I, the one known as Lucifer, the truly wicked one, proclaims….” His arms stretch across the entire studio. “Let it rain cold, hard, cash!”

The audience is delirious.

Thunder crashes. Shots ring out. Everyone screams, including me. This wasn’t part of the script. But then again, when does Damion follow the script?

(Cut to camera five)

The Devil snaps his finger. 

The studio dissolves into dust. Suddenly, instead of being inside a Hollywood studio, we’re packed inside a football stadium. The smell of stale beer and popcorn prevails.

I stumble as my heart threatens to explode. I clutch my chest, fearing the worst. My face turns red, then green, then settles on pale-white.

Damion gives me his do-as-I-say look, then points up. 

Looking up, my stomach fills with dread. A lone, greenback cascades from the sky, landing on the contestant’s head. She snatches it, stuffs it between her breasts.

More money falls. Within seconds, the stadium fills with cash. Bertha gets down to business.

Damion flies across the stadium, singing, “Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain.” His dreadful voice comes through the stadium speakers.

Pandemonium ensues.

(Cut to overhead camera)

Like a plague of locusts, money plummets into the stadium. The sky darkens. The audience is on their feet, seizing the cash. Kicking and clawing, biting and scratching, they line their pockets.

The Devil snaps his finger. Almost immediately, the downpour turns torrential. A never-ending flow of cash is dropped into the stadium. The air becomes difficult to breathe. 

People panic. 

(Cut to camera two)

My game show-host smile is slipping. With all my might, I finally speak.

“I’ve heard of it raining cats and dogs, but this is ridiculous!”

Meanwhile, my legs are trapped under three feet of cash. I’m losing my equilibrium.

(Cut to camera three)

Damion hovers over the contestant, who’s waist-deep in cash, and offers her money bags.

“Fill em up!” he shouts.

(Split screen)

Bertha snatches the money bags and starts filling them.  

Audience members, the lucky ones seated at the top, are chanting: “FILL THEM UP… FILL THEM UP…”

Contestant appears on the jumbo screen. She’s desperate, unable to keep up with the rising tides. The storm shows no sign of letting up, and she’s getting the worst of it.

(Cut to overhead camera)

The storm turns into an avalanche. The entire front row is crushed. Their screams are inaudible over the madness. They disappear. To my left, a middle-aged man is choking on an Andrew Jackson. His arms and legs are buried. I watch him get trampled, as a crowd of money-grabbers knock him aside. 

(Cut to camera four)

Damion’s eyes are dancing, as he removes his fedora and fills it with cash.

(Cut to camera four)

Bertha is up to her tits in cash; her big body buried under a mountain of green.

Her eyes meet mine.

“Bruce! Make it stop! No more money. Pleeeease.”

Her words scatter like paper in the breeze.

(Cut to camera one)

I shrug.

“Looks like Bertha got a bad deal!”

I’m surprised at how calm I sound. In truth, I’m petrified. She’s not the only one being buried alive. One wrong move and I’m a goner.

(Cut to camera four)

Damion soars across the stadium. The scoreboard lights up. Bertha’s name flashes across the screen. Apparently, she’s up by seven.

(Cut to camera three)

Bertha is choking on cash, tears leaking from her frantic eyes.  

(Split screen)

The Devil, delighted in her discomfort, applauds. 

“You’re rich, Bertha!” His laughter fills the stadium, plus millions of homes across the world, with dread.

Bertha cusses.

Damion waves his finger, giving her a no-no gesture.

(Cut to overhead camera)

The audience is in a frenzy. A family of four are holding hands, saying prayers. They’re drowning. Quickly, the children disappear. The mother shrieks, “Nooooooo!” The father frantically cries, “Someone doooo something!” 

The Devil zooms across the field and lands next to them.

(Cut to camera five) 

“Here to help,” he says. Then he flicks his finger, and punts the parents across the field for a pair of field goals.

“Six points!” I proclaim.

Under siege, the stadium succumbs to chaos. On the jumbo screen, a teenager, with earbuds dangling from his skinny neck, is trying to escape. “The doors are locked!” Someone shoves him aside; he goes sprawling down a flight of stairs, face-first. He lands with a thud. A blonde woman wearing golden earrings steps on his back, while her partner snatches the teen’s wallet. As they turn away, an avalanche buries them alive. 

(Cut to camera four)

The contestant is trying to speak, but her mouth is stuffed with cash. She’s choking. Her eyes pop, as the realization hits her: She’s going to die. 

(Close up of contestant)

Her eyes disappear. Only her head remains. Then, she’s gone.

(Cut to camera one)

I point and shrug.

“Bertha forgot to read the fine print!”

I hate the sound of my voice.

(Overhead camera)

Damion races towards me, his pitchforked tail blowing in the breeze. As he approaches, a haggard-looking man, waist deep in money, swipes his ankle. Damion hoofs him into the end zone. 

“It’s good” I say, automatically, surprising myself. “The home team leads by two!”

(Split screen)

The audience is frantic. Audience members are jumping over railings, trying to escape. The entire field is buried. 

Money falls like furious snow. I wiggle my toes to make sure they still work.  

(Cut to camera two)

I straighten up.

There’s no sign of Bertha. She’s buried.

“Looks like Bertha got more than she bargained for!”

A brick of bills smashes the side of my face. I wince. Soon I’ll be buried like Bertha. I hope my mother isn't watching. 

(Split screen)

Damion grins menacingly at the camera. 

“Yes, she most certainly did.” 

He’s playing with his tail. 

Audience members are trying to free themselves. Their efforts are in vain. The cameras, mounted on drones, capture everything. 

(Close up of the Devil)

Damion regards me pitifully, then turns to the camera and winks.

“Bruce,” the delight in his voice sickens me. “You’re drowning!”

I am. I really am.

(Cut to camera three)

Damion zooms over, lands on my head. Perched like a bird, he snaps his fingers. The sound is like a sonic boom. Suddenly, we’re back in the studio. So is the audience, the lucky ones, that is, who’ve managed to stay alive.  

(Split screen)

“Now,” he drags the word through the mud. “What’s this I hear of you wanting a salary increase?”

I gulp. This is news to me.

(Cut to camera one)

My bald forehead gleams across the screen like a greasy burger.

The audience nervously laughs.

(Cut to camera three)

Damion snaps his fingers. Another contract appears. He hands it to me.

My hands wobble as I give it a glance.

“Now that’s what I call a raise!” I say this involuntarily.

Damion is lurking over me, hatred fuming from his unholy pores. When he touches my shoulder, I jump.

Smoke fills the studio.

(Cut to camera three)

The Devil snickers into the camera.

“Whatcha think? Should Bruce sign?”

The audience cheers.

Damion hands me his pen, which is surprisingly heavy. His cold, calculated eyes never leave mine.

(Cut to camera one)

Looking nervously at the audience, I raise my arms in a vee.

“Should I sign?”

The audience chants: “SIGN IT… SIGN IT… SIGN IT….”.

My eyes catch the dollar amount carved onto the paper. It’s a lucrative deal. In fact, I’d say it’s too good to be true. The problem is: I’m too scared to read the fine print, although the rational part of my mind is screaming at me to do so. All the while, my pounding heart threatens to explode. Making a deal with the devil is the furthest thing from my mind.

(Cut to camera three)

“Go on,” says the Devil. “Whatcha afraid of?”

“SIGN IT… SIGN IT… SIGN IT….”

(Split screen)

I wipe my forehead. 

“Jeez. Talk about pressure.”

The Devil folds his arms.

Reluctantly, I sign.

The crowd roars its approval.

(Cut to camera two)

“Well, there you have it folks. Looks like Bertha got more than she’d bargained for. And apparently, I did too!”

(Cue the creepy music)

“I hope you had as much fun as we did. And I look forward to seeing you on the next addition of…”

(Cue the audience)
