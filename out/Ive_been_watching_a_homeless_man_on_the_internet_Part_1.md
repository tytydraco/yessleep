Have any of you seen Tsikuri.com? It’s this obscure website that’s popped up recently. I’ve never seen anyone talk about it on any of these forums, but I thought it might be the kind of thing you guys would appreciate.

Or, maybe appreciate is the wrong word. Find interesting? You’ll see what I mean.

I first found it about a month ago when an old internet friend emailed it to me. I guess he thought it was funny and wanted someone else to laugh about it with. I had just finished checking up on my grandmother after a bit of a health scare, so I needed something to distract myself with and calm my nerves.

He sent me a link with the message:

“LOok at this CRAZY s\*\*\* i found!!”

I censored it, not him of course.

You might be thinking I got phished, but he does this kind of thing every once in a while; sends me a sketchy-looking link after not contacting me in any way for a few months. I’ve had to call him several times in the past to make sure that he didn’t get hacked, but the more it happens the less I pay attention to it.

Now that I think about it, it really is only a matter of time before his computer gets its well-earned viruses. I should probably start to be more careful again.

All of that to say I clicked the link without much of a second thought, and got taken to the oddest streaming site I’ve ever seen. As the page loaded in, I found myself looking at an almost completely empty screen. The wallpaper was large, overlapping diamonds of slightly different shades of black. The only real feature of the site was a single video. It was just a little too small off to the side, like a pasted image in a word document. The single other signifier was a word in comic sans on the very top right corner, matching the url of the page. Tsikuri.

Intrigued, I paused the weekly lecture I was half-listening to (I got back to it later), popped open a bag of chips, and observed.

The video was some kind of security footage; a pixelated darkness broken up by street lamps providing large, fuzzy patches of light. The camera quality was terrible, as you might expect, but it was clear enough to make out an almost impressionist view of a downtown area. You could see a few storefronts, a street, a small parking lot - all made mostly vacant by the late hours of the day. The street seemed relatively urban however, and every once in a while a person or two would walk by.

I texted him back:

Me:“What am I looking at?”

He replied pretty quickly.

Him: “a security feed”

Me: “No duh. What’s the point?”

Him: “just watch for a bit”

I waited a few minutes and very little changed. The pixels vibrated as if purposefully obscuring the image, the blurry shapes like puzzle pieces that didn’t remotely fit together.

Me: “I’m not seeing anything.”

Him: “watch that bush in the back”

It took a minute to find a bush in the murkiness, but after squinting my eyes and tilting the screen back and forth I thought I saw what he was talking about. On the opposite side of the parking lot, an insufficiently maintained bush, and a dark shape to the right of it.

A few minutes later, the dark shape shifts, then awkwardly extends upward. As it eventually shambles closer to a lamppost, its silhouette becomes clearer. It’s a person.

He meanders for a bit, as if drunk, then seemingly decides where he’s going.

He walks towards the right end of the frame, and then, just as he’s about to leave, the camera switches. It took me a second to process, but I soon realized it was a different angle of the same city street.

He’s walking towards the camera now. As he gets closer I can see more of him: his large, unkept beard; his wild, receding hair; and his layered, unfitting clothes.

As the man once again leaves the frame, the unknown editor’s intent becomes a little clearer. Whenever the man gets close to leaving the shot, the camera switches, forever keeping focus on its chosen subject.

Me: “Why am I watching this?”

Him: “its funny right”

Him: “he took a s\*\*\* behind a dumpster earlier”

I can’t say I found it quite as funny as my acquaintance did, but for whatever reason I kept watching. I guess I just had nothing better to do. The… unfortunate individual continued on his way, unaware of his surveillance. He didn’t do anything particularly interesting, but the fact that he was chosen as a subject acted as a promise of interesting things to come.

Me: “Is this real footage?”

Him: “yeah for sure someones spying on a random hobo”

Me: “Well, if it’s not real, why is it here?”

Him: “its probably some weirda\*\* art project”

Him: “some wackjob modern art dude trying to make a statement”

At the time I had nothing to suggest otherwise, so I went with his assumption.

For the next few days I hopped on my computer every once in a while and checked on the strange website. Nothing remarkable happened, but curiosity and sheer boredom kept me coming back. For someone with little perceivable forethought, the man maintained a relatively consistent number of locations as destinations. He spent a few hours behind the bush, a few hours sitting on a bench, a trip through an alleyway to rummage through a dumpster, a brief stop in a park bathroom, etc. repeating through the cycle with occasional deviation. The video followed him every step of the way, cycling through a couple dozen cameras, never losing sight of him.

My friend would message me randomly, laughing about the guy stumbling and getting ignored by embarrassed passersby. One night I woke up at 3:00 in the morning to a dozen texts about the man getting kicked out of a grocery store.

I’m realizing now just how weird it was that I continued watching these videos at the very beginning. There was nothing inherently interesting happening; just a random guy walking around an unremarkable city. His antics weren’t exactly entertaining. The most interesting thing he did was throw crumbs to some black birds in the park.

Even so, I couldn’t help but feel antsy every time I stopped watching for too long. Like checking a mouse trap to see if it had performed its duty.



About a week later, as I was just starting to lose interest, something odd caught my attention. A large shape, lurking in the corner of the screen. At first I thought nothing of it, but every time the camera shifted it always seemed to stay just halfway in the edge of the footage. It was a car. It merely sat there, its headlights on.

Me: “What’s that car doing?”

Him: “i dont know”

I left the video on while I ate lunch, trying to determine the car’s purpose. After a few hours, as the homeless man watched a stray cat rustle around in a blown away trash bag, the driver’s side door opened. I squinted at the screen, trying to see anything in the choppy pixels, but they only grew more distorted. A few moments later the door closed again, with the scenery completely unchanged.

The vehicle stayed in frame until after dinner, when it blinked away in the cut of a camera. Despite my stakeout, nothing had continued to happen. The man went about his normal activities, eating some fries he found in a trash can. Around 2 a.m., when I could hardly keep my eyes open any longer, I finally gave up and went to bed.

I woke up the next morning to find two texts:

“dude look at the site”

‘the guys f\*\*\*in gone”

I groggily crawled over to my computer and logged onto the website. The camera displayed was the one I had seen the very first few minutes of my viewing of the feed. The same storefronts, the same parking lot, the same bush in the distance. But sure enough, the man was nowhere to be found. I waited for 15 minutes, just to make sure he wasn’t hidden by the distorted image, but no luck.

Then suddenly, the camera changed. It was the street he would walk down to get to his favorite bench. It changed again a few moments later, continuing his usual path without him. The rest of the city maintained its usual morning bustle, but there was an invisible hole in the images, traveling in the footsteps of a man I’ve never met. I’m not entirely sure why, but the void felt like a vacuum, like an empty seat at a dinner table, or a bag of blood just taken from my arm. I had to close the tab.

After a few minutes of collecting my thoughts, I asked my contact what had happened to the homeless person. He said that the man had started to act “out of it.” Well, more out of it than usual I guess. He was stumbling all over the place, and seemed like he could barely keep himself up. He walked to the edge of a parking lot, then just collapsed on the ground.

The weirdest thing, according to him, was that when the camera switched angles, he was completely gone. Without a trace. The camera was pointing directly at the spot where he had fallen down, but there was no sign of him.

He reminded me that the man, of course, was just an actor, so they could’ve edited the video any way they wanted.

I hope that is the case.

If that was where this all ended I probably wouldn’t be posting about it here. This was all intriguing, but just a strange video doesn’t warrant a post on this page. What made me write this all out was what happened just yesterday.

The cameras are following someone new.
