Legend has it that, resting atop the hill on the southernmost side of town, is a house.

A house so steeped in fear and the unknown that few have dared to step foot in it.

A house that feels like a separate reality.

The House of The Crooked Children.

Well, I can tell you, it isn’t a legend. The house is real, and the children are too.

I lived in Fallscean, Maine for the first 19 years of my life. From 1989 until 2008, there I was.

Now, the town itself is an anomaly. If I had 5 pairs of hands, I still don’t think I’d be able to talk about everything I experienced there, let alone what I’ve heard about then and now.

Still, I have hundreds of stories to tell my children, if I ever have any. But by far the scariest thing I experienced while living in that town was when I was in the House of The Crooked Children.

Every place has an urban legend, or legends. Fallscean is no different. A lot of what this town has could be considered as such if it hadn’t been shown to us that most of what we talk about is real.

But the Crooked Children were an anomaly in a town full of them.

I’d heard whispers, I’d heard people talk about going up to the house, but losing their nerve and leaving. I had to find out just what this place was.

The stories about people going missing weren’t frequent, but it did happen.

Someone would go inside and they’d never return home. That was another thing; I needed to know what happened to those missing people.

The first time I heard of the Crooked House was when I was 8 and in the second grade. My friend David told me about in passing. Said he found out from his older brother.

When I asked him for details, all he told me was that “they look weird! Like—like their limbs are the wrong way, and their faces are scary!”

It made sense; the “crooked children” actually looking as such. It scared the hell out of me to think of, though. I’d end up wetting the bed some nights because I was afraid I’d encounter one in my hallway.

The next logical step was to ask my parents.

When mom was making breakfast one day, I popped the question.

“Hey, mom. Have you heard of the Crooked Children?”

She turned around with a slightly panicked look on her face.

“What? Robbie, where did you hear that from?”

“D—David, my friend at school. But he heard it from his brother!”

“His brother is telling him those stories? That family.” She grumbled.

“No, mom! I think he overheard him talking about it. Please don’t make me and David stop being friends.”

“I’m not going to do that. His mother and I are going talk though, good lord.”

This conversation with my mother told me one thing; she knew something and didn’t want to tell me.

The next step was to ask my dad.

Mom used to have AA meetings every Wednesday night, so dad and I had to make dinner during those evenings.

This one was no different than the others. We had just started preparation for dinner; it was homemade pizza tonight.

It was during the mixing of the dough that I asked him.

“Hey, dad… I already asked mom about this but she didn’t want to say anything. Do—do you know about the Crooked Children?”

His eyes went wide with surprise and looked down at me.

“Crooked Children? Who’d you hear about that from? Older kids?”

“No.” I replied, looking down. “I heard it from David.”

“David? That’s weird. He doesn’t seem like the type.”

“Because he isn’t! He heard about it from his older brother! Mom said that she was going to talk to David’s mom about it.”

“Ah, okay.”

“So?”

“So what?”

“So… what do you know about them?”

“Oh, son. It’d scare you too much. I’ll te—.”

“It won’t. I promise it won’t scare me.”

“Well, okay then. If you do get scared then don’t come crying to me!”

“I won’t.”

And so, he began his story. I’ll be telling it from his perspective just to make it a bit easier to read.

Here goes.

Alright, so it was me and one of my buddies. Richard, I think. Anyways, it was 1983 and we were both 19-year-old college students who wanted nothing more than to find something cool to do on a Saturday night.

 Something that wasn’t drinking or consuming any other illicit substances, at least.

So? We decided we’d go to the famed “Crooked House.” I’ll tell you, I sure wish we hadn’t.

Since it was the weekend, our parents couldn’t really care less about how late we stayed out, just that we didn’t come home in an ambulance.

I got in my car and drove the 5 minutes to pick up Rich. During that drive, I asked myself “is this worth it? We could be partying or something like that, but no; we’re going to the goddamn Crooked House.”

I decided that it would be worth it. If we found something cool, then there’d be a story to tell at FUTURE parties. A win-win.

I picked him up and we started driving south.

“So, you excited?” Rich asked, twiddling his thumbs.

My anticipation for this venture was steadily increasing as we neared closer to the house.

30 minutes later, we were at the base of the hill. Rich and I got out of the car.

No words were needed; we just started climbing.

I thought that it would been a lot easier to scale it, but the hill proved to me that I should have done a bit better in gym class.

From start to finish, I remember it taking a full hour to climb up the hill. That included breaks and all that.

So, sweaty and out of breath, we finally reached the top of the hill. What stood in front of us was fascinating.

It was a one-story house, enveloped in black. The windows were all boarded up and it looked like it had been abandoned for years, likely because it was.

And the most present detail; the house was slightly slanted. A crooked house with crooked people in it. Fitting similarities.

The front door was locked, but Rich and I were determined to get in. We decided that the best solution would be to barge into the door at the same time.

It took three charges, but we managed to get the door open.

The inside was just as imposing as the outside. We brought flashlights so the darkness wasn’t an issue.

If I had to describe the interior, it’d go something like this; dusty, REALLY dusty. I’d like to say there were rodents like mice and rats, but I think there were spiders and all sorts of tiny living things too.

The first area we looked at was the living room.

Nothing unusual, just a couch. Well, that was kind of unusual, actually. It literally only had a couch, nothing else.

There was a BIG spider in the corner ceiling, but that was it.

The kitchen was a wasn’t any more interesting.

Remnants of a meal long spoiled sat on the dinner table. There were some small bones on the floor that Rich and I assumed to be ones from an animal.

A sound from the bedroom alerted us. A crumpling noise.

We rushed out into the main area and to what we thought was the bedroom. The door was ajar and we could see inside if we shone our light.

There, on the floor, lay a skeleton. We assumed that the noise from earlier was it falling onto the floor. Regardless, we shut the door and began to panic.

“Dude, what the hell?” Rich asked. “What the hell?!”

“I—I don’t know man! Shit, I—I think—.”

My voice was cut off by the sounds of creaking.

Rich and I turned to find that we missed a door.

The *basement* door.

We heard creaks as something lumbered up the stairs. Uneven, *crooked* footsteps.

Whatever had in that basement was now coming up the stairs, and we were *right* in its field of vision.

I grabbed Rich and began to drag him.

“RICH! We need to get the hell out of here, man! Come on!”

He snapped out of his stupor and began to run with me. By the time we bounded out of the front door, I turned around one last time.

And I saw nothing. But the basement door was open.

When I dropped Rich off at his house, I asked him a question before he went inside.

“Do—do we tell people about this?”

He looked at me despondently and replied to my question.

“I can’t.”

And that was the last time I ever did something with him.

Richard and his family left Fallscean a couple weeks later, and after that, it was like he wasn’t there.

I’ve been holding this in for a long time, and I’ve told few other people. Your mother, your uncle Ken, and you.

I tell you this story because I want you to be aware of the evil in this town. We ARE safe from it, but you need to stay away from that house. Do you understand, son?

“I—I do.”

But I wasn’t going to listen.

Dad and I never did talk about it again, and we kept it a secret from mom.

She wouldn’t be able to handle it if she knew that I was aware of the evil in that house. They both wanted me to be happy and live a good life free from the burden of that place.

It’s just a goddamn shame I didn’t listen to them.

11 years later, I would go to the house much the same as my father. Except I went alone, because you know, I had to.

I went, not because there was nothing to do, but because I *wanted* to. It was a weekend night during the summer, similar to when my father went.

I waited for my parents to fall asleep. That’s when I left. The 30 minutes passed by quickly and the hour up wasn’t much to write home about either.

When I crested the hill, I saw it.

The *Crooked House*.

It was decrepit, falling apart, dark, and inviting all at the same time.

Luckily for me, the door was already open, so I went in.

What I saw in there will never leave me until the day I die. What is in that house… it’s pure evil. But you need to know why it’s the way it is.

So, now that I’ve experienced what’s in that house as well as learned it’s history, I think it’s time I tell you the story…

The story of the Crooked Children.

In the latter half of the Twentieth Century, a family moved into the town that I used to live in. During this time, Fallscean wasn’t nearly as infamous as it is now. Hell, you could go to the town market and be just fine. Things are certainly different now.

Regardless, the new family was interesting.

They were socially inept, gloomy and to top it off; scary.

But one thing stood out among this family, and it was the three children. All brothers.

They were like any normal siblings, but their appearance set them apart from the other kids. They had ugly faces, and their limbs were contorted, going in the wrong direction.

*Crooked*.

They couldn’t walk properly, so they had to crawl around. If you ran into one of them at night, you couldn’t be blamed for being terrified.

As a result, the three brothers were harassed and bullied relentlessly. I don’t think I need to say what kind of names they were given.

Instead of taking the whole family and moving, it is theorized that the mother and father chose to abandon their children, leaving them in the house to rot.

Since the children were social pariahs, even the thought of leaving the house terrified them. So, what did they do? Nothing, they did nothing and people came anyways.

There’s something evil in that house, and the children were consumed by it.

I suspect they nourished themselves using any living creatures in the house. That, and taking anyone stupid enough to come to the house.

Ever since then, no sightings have been reported, but anyone with their head in the right place knows to avoid it.

Funnily enough, through all the horror of the story, it’s saddening and enraging to think about. The parents left their children behind to pursue a life free from harassment.

The evil that the parents committed left these children in the way they are now.

There is something unearthly in that house, and I never want to experience it again.

I’ll tell you my experience in the hope that you choose to live your life free of a burden like this. Having to think about what I’ve seen every day has led to an unfulfilling life.

But I’ll tell you about it anyways.

When I entered the house, it was much in the same way that my dad described it; dark, dusty and alive despite nobody in sight.

I knew what I was here for, so I went straight to the basement door.

I didn’t hear anything, but it looked terrifying down there. I shone my light down, and I kid you not; I couldn’t see a *thing*.

It wasn’t that my light didn’t work, I just couldn’t *see*.

I went to back up when it happened.

I heard a squeak behind me, felt a crunch under my shoe and slipped on something. I later found out that it was a mouse I crushed by accident.

Of course, I couldn’t fall back into the house, so I went tumbling down the stairs.

My flashlight flew out of my hands halfway through the fall and when I landed with a crash, I was completely enveloped in darkness.

From the second I recovered, I knew my right arm and leg were broken, so I would have to crawl to my flashlight.

Luckily for me, there was a small sliver of light in the corner.

I just had to make it there.

I began to drag my broken body across the ground using my left arm. It hurt like hell but I couldn’t see the stairs so that flashlight was my only way out of here.

When I was about halfway to the flashlight, I heard a noise.

Footsteps, footsteps slowly approaching me.

My heart thumped in my chest. The sound of bare feet slapping against the concrete floor was terrifying because I knew I wasn’t alone.

Something was down here with me. Whether it wanted to hurt me or not, I didn’t know, but I did know one thing; I needed to get out of here. I had made a mistake

But things only got worse.

The footsteps were uneven, *crooked*.

I began to move faster, if you could consider moving my left arm quicker as such.

Dragging myself across the floor was an agonizing process that took nearly five minutes. I was sweaty, covered in dust, and something was slowly approaching me.

I was nearly at the light when I felt a hand grab onto my foot. My heart began to thump unabated in my chest.

Whatever the hell was down here had just grabbed onto me. I shrieked, got up into a sitting position, reeled back and punched whatever had grabbed me in the face as hard as I could.

The grip on my leg loosened and I skittered over to the flashlight. I struggled to stand up, but I was able to position myself to a point where I could limp up the stairs.

I just needed to be faster than whatever was down there with me.

I began to limp over to the stairs. As I approached them, something made a noise behind me. A terrifying, rasping sound.

*“haaaaaah*.”

It was getting closer and I couldn’t let it. I went to position myself on the first step. I took a moment to catch my breath, but that was all it needed.

I felt a bony hand grab my shoulder, and before I could get it off me, I had been shoved and thrown halfway across the room.

Once more, I was vulnerable and without my light.

“G—God, shit. Christ that hurts.” I could barely move. I couldn’t even feel my arm and leg. One thought was present in my mind.

“You went to the Crooked House and you couldn’t even tell people about it? You goddamn failure.”

Out of options, all I could do was cry, scream and curse at myself.

I had completely forgotten that something else was down there with me, only being reminded of it when I heard it make a noise again.

“*hoooh? HOOOH!*”

I took that as much to assume it had found me.

I felt a hand on my back before it flipped me over. I could feel my right arm and leg crunch and pop more as they moved. It was excruciating but I couldn’t do a thing about it.

Whatever it was got on top of me, wrapping its gangly, crooked arms around my neck and positioning its face close to mine.

I could smell the slight scent of rot on it. I wasn’t sure what this thing was planning, but what it ended up trying was the last thing I thought it’d do.

It attempted to kiss me. Or maybe it tried to eat my face. I don’t know, whatever it was, the thing tried to make contact with my face using its face.

I had to do something. So, when it raised its head again, I slammed mine into it and the thing slumped to the ground, temporarily stunned.

I took this opportunity to crawl towards the stairs. I could hear it getting up behind me.

I had to go quick.

Dragging myself up the stairs with one arm was hard enough.

Dragging myself up the stairs with one arm and a broken leg was harder.

Dragging myself up the stairs with one arm, a broken leg and bleeding wounds that made the steps slippery was practically pointless.

I was halfway up when I temporarily lost my strength. My body, slick with blood, slid down the stairs…

And I crashed into it. That thing had been going up with stairs with me.

It was nearly on me, so I rammed into and knocked it down the stairs.

Finding my strength before going up the rest of the stairs, I grabbed onto the step and began to make my way up again.

It took a few minutes, but after a struggle and a lot of pain, I was nearly there.

I was so close. I didn’t know how much progress this thing had made compared to me, but I wasn’t going to try and find out.

By the time I reached the top of the stairs, my questions had been answered; the sound was right behind me.

“*haaaah, HAH!”*

It gripped onto my leg again and I had to turn around to stop it.

What I saw in that moment will never leave me.

Its face was deformed, yes, but this thing looked like a child had drawn it.

It was as absurd as it was terrifying.

One of the eyes was centered near the top of its head while the other was in the normal place. The mouth was so much wider than it should have been.

And it’s teeth…God. Lining the mouth were rows of rotting, jagged teeth. Some spots were there weren’t rotted chunks of enamel had exposed, raw roots in their place.

On the gums and roof of this thing’s maw were large, green, weeping sores. Its breath smelled like rot, like *death*.

I had to make a split-second decision. So, I kicked it off me and turned around. As I limped out of the house, I turned around one last time to see it try to reach through the entrance of the basement while letting out an unholy screech.

And, as I reached the outside, I could see two skeletons near the entrance.

Deformed, *contorted* skeletons.

When the adrenaline wore off, I collapsed and ended up tumbling down the hill. Before I passed out from the pain, I was able to call my dad.

“D—dad. Help.”

He was groggy but responded anyways.

“Hur? Ugh, sorry. What’s going on?”

“I’m at the crooked house. My leg and arm. They’re broken. Please, help.”

And then I passed out.

I don’t remember much after that, but as soon as I recovered from my injuries, I left Fallscean like a bat out of hell. I couldn’t stay there anymore.

These days, I don’t do much. I call my parents every once in a while, just to see how things are holding up back home. They tell me things are fine, so I believe them.

I don’t ask about the Crooked House or Children either, my father and I both know too much about that to hold comfortable conversations, so we don’t.

When anyone asks me about my most terrifying life experience, I always tell them that it was the time I encountered a black widow spider in my car while driving on the highway.

It’s easy, it’s cheap and it fulfills their needs for an answer.

But in all actuality, the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced was that goddamn house. I’ll never go near it again; the memories are too much to handle.

There’s evil in that house. Something hungry lies in there waiting for anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into its domicile.

Now, I can’t make your decisions for you, but, in the event that you decide to explore some abandoned building or house for cheap thrills, don’t let it be this one.

Because this house is real.

And so are the *Crooked Children*.
