I was 13 years old when I first saw it. It was during Holy Week, that peculiar time when everything feels still, though that year, my family felt utterly broken. My grandmother was gravely ill. Alzheimer's had eroded her memories, hypertension and arthritis had weakened her body, and her health had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. My mother and aunt alternated shifts at the hospital, leaving the house silent—just me and my loyal dog, Nacho.

That morning began like any other, though the air carried something strange, something heavy. My mother woke me before dawn. She leaned down, kissed my forehead, and with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, told me she’d left breakfast ready. I watched her leave, and for some reason, a knot formed in my stomach. Something wasn’t right, though I didn’t know what.

I stayed in bed for a while, but the unease wouldn’t let me rest. I got up, ate breakfast, and fed Nacho, trying to shake off the feeling. Then I settled on the couch in the living room. Nacho curled up beside me as my gaze wandered to my grandmother’s chair, the one by the window. It was her favorite spot. She’d spend hours there, staring outside as if waiting for something. Thinking about her filled me with a mixture of sadness and anxiety. Was she suffering? Did she still remember who I was? Slowly, exhaustion crept over me, and I fell asleep holding Nacho close.

I don’t know how much time passed, but a low growl woke me from my slumber. I opened my eyes, still groggy, and noticed Nacho was tense, his little body vibrating against mine. Confused, I looked at him, but his gaze was fixed on something. Following his line of sight, I saw it.

My grandmother’s chair was no longer empty.

A dark figure, almost like a tangible shadow, sat there. It was tall, with a hat that obscured any details of its face. It sat completely still, staring out the window the way my grandmother used to. The air in the room turned icy, and an overwhelming sense of dread filled the space.

Nacho’s growl grew louder, but I couldn’t move. I could only stare, my heart pounding in my chest. The figure didn’t turn toward us; it was as if we didn’t exist. And yet, its presence was suffocating.

Then, slowly, the figure turned its head—not toward me, but as if searching for something beyond the window. After a moment, it stood up. It was immense, so tall it seemed too large for the room. It moved deliberately, its heavy footsteps echoing in the unbearable silence as it walked past me.

I watched in paralyzed terror as it made its way to the back of the house, toward the unused rooms that had always felt cold and filled with echoes. Those spaces were eerie enough on their own, but now they seemed like a yawning abyss. The figure vanished into the shadows, and only then did I realize I’d been holding my breath.

Nacho continued growling, though his barks were muffled because, instinctively, I had covered his mouth. I didn’t want that thing to come back. For minutes, I sat frozen, until the silence became unbearable. I turned on every light, the TV, and any source of noise I could find, as if I could banish what had just happened.

Then the phone rang.

The sound startled me so much that I nearly screamed. With trembling hands, I picked up the receiver. On the other end was my mother’s voice, thick with tears.

“Are you okay, sweetheart?” she asked, but her tone wasn’t one of relief—it was something darker.

“Yes, Mom,” I whispered, my voice barely audible.

There was silence on the other end, and then she said it:

“Your grandmother...” She paused, as if the words were too heavy to speak. “Your grandmother just passed away.”

The air left my chest. It felt like the world had stopped.

“When?” I asked, my voice a thread.

“Not long ago. Maybe... half an hour.”

Half an hour.

I hung up the phone and sat there, unmoving, her words echoing in my mind. The shadow, that man in the chair, had appeared right around that time. Had it come for her? Was it someone she knew—or something sent to collect her?

I don’t know, but since that day, I’ve never looked at that chair without a chill running down my spine.

Now I know there’s an entity known as the Hat Man—or so it’s been described. Was it the same entity that visited me that morning 13 years ago?
