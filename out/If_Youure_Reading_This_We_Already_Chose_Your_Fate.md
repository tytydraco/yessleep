 If you are reading this, it's already too late. You are either locked up tight, or your hours are numbered.
You have to understand, we did the best we could, and I don't know if anyone else could have done any better, not in this time frame. I've always struggled to connect with people. I thought maybe if I kept my distance, it would keep me safe from being disappointed whenever they leave. Now that's the only thing I really want. Right now, for you, it's the only thing that matters.
Let me take you back to the beginning, a few weeks ago. Like I said, I suck at people. I had hoped that I could reach out and share ideas on paper if I couldn't do it in person. I spent all my spare time on this book, spent money on a publisher. We even had this trick where I was going to buy back a bunch of copies so it looked like sales were better than they were. I paid to promote the hell out of it. I tap danced on social media trying to sell it, posted it everywhere I could. The New York Times bestseller list updates weekly, so you can technically be a best seller for a few hours and still get bragging rights. It just didn't happen. I put everything I had into my last chance at connecting, and I got nothing.

I had really shot myself in the foot, overextended. I took out some loans I really shouldn't have, had to quit my job to do all the promotional stuff. Never had the best job history, but this was a black eye. So I started volunteering for studies. The only good that came out of the book was I got selected for a think tank. Thought maybe we'd be editing scripts or taking surveys. I walked in with Hoppe's 9 on my breath.

It was me and three other people. We met in a boardroom that felt cheap, stick on tile carpet kind of cheap. They made us wait for a bit, I wonder if that was on purpose to see how we'd react. There was a geneticist, Dr Sylvia Krieg, an architect named Mabel Chang, a psychologist and part-time profiler named Ed Smith. And then there was me, a college drop out, similar age but markedly under accomplished, sticking out like a sore thumb. That was until we arrived at the tower. 

The guy with a nasty scar across his face but a surprisingly warm smile walked in, obviously wearing body armor under his suit and tie. That's Mike Bowie, security. He and some lawyer walked in first having us all sign in NDA that nothing said today or during the project would be mentioned to anyone else until a specific date. That day is today and I'm telling you now. Last person I mention, promise, And this is where it gets weird; Levi Cohen walks in.

If you know, you know. If you don't, you're like me and had to look him up. Levi Cohen is the CEO of several very wealthy but very boring companies, diversified and wealthy enough to be a part of Black Rock, and smart enough to stay out of the spotlight. I had just enough time to glean all of this before he asked me to put my phone down.

They expected some kind of smug soulless man child with a Napoleon complex. Instead, he looks tired, disheveled. Like someone who had been up for 48 hours and just threw on clean clothes in the dark. He sank into his seat while giving us the presentation. As he started talking, Mike came back with the kind of cart you would order room service with, something huge and awkward on top covered in a sheet. Levi's voice cracked.

“You all saw the NDAs, and what I'm about to ask you cannot leave this room. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that I am asking you to help save the world.”

He paused for a fact. Maybe he thought one of us would object or laugh. We gave each other puzzled looks and then slowly refocused on him as he continued. 

“I've been planning for something like this my whole life. Every spare dollar has gone into this contingency plan, and I had hoped I would die without ever having to use it. But yesterday, astronomers picked up a  solar micronova event. The sun lets out a burst of energy that will reach us in a few short weeks. The initial blast of plasma and radiation will scorch the surface. Anything that survives that will die in a cosmic winter caused by ash blotting out the sun for anywhere between 20 and 40 years.

Everyone you love, everyone you have met, everyone you've ever passed on the street is about to die unless you help me.”

Nobody spoke for a long while. I couldn't help it. I clapped my hands slowly, yes I'm that asshole, and started looking for hidden cameras. I didn't know any of these people. This sounded like a hoax or some kind of roleplay.

“So you're trying to use the same core idea of the book without getting sued, right?”

Levi didn't seem angry or surprised, just sad. Mabel wasn't amused either.

“What are you talking about?”

I waved her off.

“You guys can drop the act. I get it. You guys want to make a movie or a show or something, and you need my blessing for the intellectual property of ‘The Trolley Man.’ Well, I'm not taking a lump sum settlement. I want royalties.”

Levi sighed.

“Actually, you're going to be taken care of for the rest of your lives. All of you. Between now and the deadline, you're having all expenses paid and limitless credit cards, my treat. When the deadline is reached, all four of you have a place in the shelter. If you don't believe me, check your bank account. All of your debts are wiped clean.”

I opened my phone and my inbox was full. Several different loan companies and the car company sent me congratulation letters for closing transactions. The last one of course wanted to remind me that there was a penalty for paying off early. The amount in my bank account hadn't changed, but the loan against it was gone. A black credit card slid across the table to each of us. He tried to hide it, but Mike looked a little smug. 

“The pins are your birth dates. They're already activated and ready to go.”

My throat went dry, and I was still skeptical, but definitely curious. 

“So what are we supposed to do?”

Levi continued. 

“I've built a bunker into a hillside but its own power station, air scrubbers, climate control, blah blah blah. We have enough staff and food to keep the place running once the door is closed.

We have an AI algorithm to assist you and a RAT program giving you access to social media accounts, medical records, government watch lists, everything you might want to know about anyone. Your job is to find 4400 from the local population to put in the bunker with us and restart humanity when it's safe to go back to the surface.”

Ed balked.

“That's incredibly unethical. You're admitting to thousands upon thousands of felony offenses, maybe even treason depending on what files you opened.”

Levi smiled.

“A videogame was released recently in which a man tries to protect a girl in order to save humanity, but it turns out in order to do it, she has to die. They had failed multiple times before and there was a chance this would fail too, but the creators said the characters might be successful. He literally failed the Trolley Dilemma. I'm asking you not to and instead be objective. Even if it means hating me, hating yourself. Even if it means the end of you. I'm asking you to put your biases aside and be objective. I am asking you to do the right thing. You are all single, no dependents, distant from family.”

Mabel spat out her words.

“Do it yourself!”

He didn't seem surprised.

“My job has always been finding someone with the ability and putting them in the best place to do what they are good at. I'm not qualified. You four are. The survivors will go into a bunker under the tower.”

Mike dramatically pulled back the cloth in the cart, revealing a massive, but intricate model. Some kind of structure with tiny human figures on it. 1:220 scale. It was upside down. He turned it over delicately and hung it on a stand, adding an obolisque to the top.

“The inhabitants of the shelter will be safe while the world burns. The Tower will be a vantage point and a symbol of hope.”

Mike blurted out.

“Peter Gabriel…Once you go in, you don't come out.”

Levi straightened.

“I'll give you some time to decide.”

He stepped out of the room and let us argue amongst ourselves for the better part of an hour. At some point, Silvia asked about my book.

“So what is your role in all of this?”

“I wrote a book. There's city living on a space station. Something goes wrong and a section breaks loose. They don't have enough air or supplies to last until rescue, so an engineer gets selected to pick the survivors. He lives with these people, his friends, neighbors, and co-workers. He starts off with the obvious stuff; women and children first, the most qualified. He does triage for the others who are wounded or unhealthy. It's not enough. He disqualifies a guy he thinks is a sociopath. He can't bring himself to pick at random so he ends up picking petty reasons, frivolous stuff. Someone called a woman's backside ‘turd choppers.’ He knew someone was into feet. Finally he ends up with enough people. The ones that get tricked into a room where he sucks the air out. In the end, it turns out they miscalculated. He culled twice as many people as needed. It didn't sell well.”

That put a hush over the room until Ed finally nodded.

“Still, you may not be as qualified as the rest of us, but you have clearly put far more thought into this.”

I bet none of us slept well that night. I had a dream we were trading baseball cards, a physicist for a personal trainer. Cards kept falling into the discard pile.

Day one, we all came back from the hotel. I didn't know what to do, so I made a playlist that was less than subtle.

Cold - End of the World
The Postal Service - We will become silhouettes
R.E.M.
You get the idea. Mabel was the only one who laughed.

I asked what the event would look like. Mike said it would be a blinding white light with long shadows and feel like the inside of an oven. There would be a wall of fire and the smell of ozone before everyone was snuffed out. Scary, but quick.

We started listing parameters for the vetting program, listing demands and compromises. Ed insisted the library in the bunker include every Brendan Frasier movie and that the first shown in the communal theater be ‘Blast from the Past.’ His justification was straight faced.

“Because he's a national treasure.”

We couldn't just populate the entire place with children, so we had to make the difficult acknowledgement. Violent criminals and the elderly were an automatic no. Domestic abuse cases, we decided required a conviction, not just an accusation. We didn't keep demographics even, but we did have it slightly weighted for genetic diversity. We bickered for a while about hereditary defects and whether or not non life threatening issues could be overlooked, especially if the person had a valuable skill.

We found out Levi had plans to raid a fertility clinic the day before splash down for eggs, but he didn't want that to change our decisions, just reassure us.

Lunches were catered by some gourmet restaurant I'd never heard of. Good stuff, but I couldn't tell you what half of it was.

Dinners were on us. The first full day's work I ate a White Castle crave case in my hotel room by myself. Because why not? I gained 11 pounds by the time the tower doors closed for good.

I came in a touch late the next day. Had to keep mum until we “clocked out” for the day. We had these black cards, so I thought I would splurge, a red Ferrari for Silvia, a black Porsche for Mabel, a white bronco for Ed. I always wanted a mustang, and the only one they had on hand was this weird greenish yellow. I didn't have time to wait and I wanted it to be a surprise.

One morning Silvia came in and said she was debating giving up her spot in favor of squeezing one more person on. The rest of us were surprised because each of us had assumed we would at some point or another on day one. Ed explained this was probably a good idea because we would all have a high likelihood of survivor's guilt and might not make it for long anyway. Good times.

We had enough genetic variety from our pool alone, let alone the fertility clinic raid, so that wasn't a factor. We still had way too many people to pick from, so we resorted to cultural paradigms. We weeded out anyone who was into anallingus, coprophagia, anyone riding that line between kinky and abuse while making a point not to be prudish about it.

Mabel came to my hotel room that night. That was certainly fun, and it felt good to have somebody with me, but we both knew how it was going to end. I tried to talk her into changing things, and that led to a huge fight. Jit argued that we didn't know if what we had would even last. She said even if it did, we would hate ourselves or each other eventually for taking someone else off the roster. 

So that was it. The last couple of days as things wound down there was a little arguing, a lot of crying. Finally the day came and we had to do our thing. The plan was I would wait to release this until the doors were already closed. We were supposed to leave the tower together in a kind of parade. I looked into everybody else's vehicles. Silvia had all kinds of marital aids; vibrators, sildenafil, tadalafi, olive oil, vasodilators, even condoms, which made me laugh.

Mabel had a caterer following her and had her seats packed with bags to throw out at pedestrians or leave in piles along the way for people to discover.
Ed struck me as a straight edge/teetotaler type, which made the party drugs and blow sticks he had loaded up with all the more surprising.

I hadn't brought anything. I didn't even know why we were still bothering with any of this. It was already too late for us to ask for our spots back on the lifeboat. I love the others leave in order, each with their own little route. We were guaranteed that the police would be distracted and we had traffic signalers, the kind of late ambulance drivers use so they always get a green light. I would catch one of them a few streets over throwing something out the window, or a crowd-gathering where I knew they would be. 

The whole thing seemed pointless. Even if everybody had a panic attack for the next several hours, what difference did it make? I walked in there ready to end it all. I was so lonely, and now that I finally have people I care about, we're just supposed to lie down and die? And he cared if anybody else went a little bit early? Some guy was jay walking, so I hit the accelerator. He didn't even know I was doing the kindness.

In the end, we were all going to go alone. I was stupid opening up to them. Stupid for caring about all these thousands of strangers. The only thing I had wrong before was that I missed out on all the hedonism.

I wasn't sure what to do now. I was going to park somewhere and just wait for it to happen. My phone lit up with messages from the others. I answered the one and a video popped up of all three begging me to come back. They said I was being selfish. Maybe I really am. I didn't want my last act to be hurting them. Fuck it. Why not?  It's not like I have anything better to do. I get the chance to leave a message behind for humanity and all I can muster is a few random thoughts on a half finished note. No time to proofread.

Doors are closed now. You're either safe down there, or you're doomed up here with us. By the time you finish this, you should have about 6 or 7 hours. 6:34pm is the projected time. Enough time to call your loved ones, pound one out, maybe watch ‘The Mummy’ trilogy, but if you're a slow reader, you might skip through some of the second movie, especially when Dwayne Johnson shows up in CGI form. As for us, me and my only friends in the world are going to hold hands and sing kumbaya while we smile for the flash. Just know that we did our best and please try not to hate us.
