It was one of those nights that felt timeless, the kind where the world outside doesn’t matter and the only thing that exists is the group of us sprawled across my living room.

The couch was a tangle of limbs and empty pizza boxes, remnants of an all-day movie marathon that had started with the classics—*The Goonies*, *Jaws*, *Ghostbusters*—and drifted into whatever random horror films we could find on Netflix. Zoe was curled up in the corner of the couch, her legs tucked under her, a bowl of popcorn in her lap as she kept flicking through her phone. Theo was leaning against the armrest, focused on whatever game was playing on the TV, and Sasha—well, she was sprawled on the floor, tucked into her hoodie like she always was when she didn’t want to be bothered, her back against the wall.

The air smelled faintly of melted cheese and something vaguely sweet, probably from all the soda we’d been downing since the first movie started. Even with the window cracked open, the warm night air creeping in, the room felt a little heavy. It had been a long week. But now, this... this was perfect. No pressures, no distractions. Just us.

We were playing some strategy game. I was always a step ahead, always seeing things that others didn’t. Evan, the master of logic.

“Well, I’m gonna have to call it soon, Evan,” Theo said, his voice low, not looking away from the TV. “I have an early shift tomorrow.” Evan grinned at me, but I could tell there was a hint of exhaustion in his eyes. Theo had been the one looking out for us since high school, making sure we didn’t do anything too stupid. He had this quiet, reassuring vibe about him, like he could handle anything life threw at him.

Sasha didn't respond immediately, which was typical. She never really got involved unless she had to. She sat there, her eyes half-lidded as she scrolled through her phone, tapping at the screen with something close to disinterest. Not like Zoe, who was always on ten, constantly full of energy and bright ideas. I half-wondered if Zoe had ever known how to sit still in her life.

Then it came—a buzz.

My phone vibrated once on the coffee table, a simple, sharp jolt that pulled my attention away from the board game. I picked it up without thinking. The notification was a text message from an unknown number.

I frowned, squinting at the screen.

*“Hey Evan, we’ve got something for you. Four tickets to The Carnival of Midnight tonight only. It’s a one-time event, no ads, no promotions. It’s just for those who are meant to find it. Meet us on the outskirts of the old cornfield at the edge of town. 9 PM. Bring the crew.”*

For a moment, I just stared at it, blinking, as if my mind was trying to make sense of the words.

Sasha, as if sensing the sudden shift in energy, looked up from her phone. "What's that?" she asked in her usual half-bored tone, but her eyes were starting to sharpen.

"I dunno. Just some weird text." I paused, reading it again. “The Carnival of Midnight? Ever heard of it?”

Zoe leaned forward from her corner, her eyes bright, as usual. "A carnival? That sounds so fun! I mean, one-night-only? It's like... secretive, mysterious. It could be something magical."

I could already feel the skepticism rising in me. *No ads? No promotions?* That alone seemed too off to ignore. I clicked the link that came with the text, the bold letters reading *The Carnival of Midnight* lighting up my phone screen.

The page loaded quickly, showcasing a dark, almost otherworldly image of a circus tent, backlit by pale, ghostly lights. Carnies, tents and stands full of trick games were strewn about. A towering Ferris wheel spun slowly in the background, though the sky behind it was pitch-black, without a single star. Beneath the tent were blurred, ethereal figures—people, I guessed—but their faces were blurred out. The page was sparse, offering only a few lines of text.

*"Step into the unknown. A place where wishes are granted, secrets are kept, and souls are tested. The Carnival of Midnight opens for one night only. Will you dare to enter?"*

I stared at the screen for a moment, a part of me already saying *don’t go*, but another part... well, I couldn’t deny that the intrigue was there. The skeptic in me was already crafting explanations for how this could all be some elaborate prank, but that gut feeling, that pulse of curiosity I tried so hard to ignore, kept pushing me.

I looked up at the others, holding the phone out in front of me. "It’s a weird invitation. But... I don’t know. What do you guys think? Maybe it's one of those pop-up things—could be interesting."

Zoe was already bouncing in her seat. "I want to go! Maybe it'll be like a haunted carnival? Or like, a cool, spooky experience?" She looked between the rest of us, her eyes wide and filled with that infectious excitement. “Please, please, please, let’s go!”

I was about to say something, to call out how insane it all seemed, but Theo’s voice interrupted me. "It’s just one night. And if it’s a bust, we leave. Let’s try it out. If it’s a real carnival, I’m in."

I hesitated for a moment, then exhaled sharply. *Maybe I was overthinking this*. What was the harm? It could be a prank, but it could also be something totally harmless, a chance to do something different for once. I looked back at my phone, the timestamp showing that we had just under two hours to get there.

I tapped the screen and sent the message back.

*“We’re in.”*



We packed up the games, cleaned up our mess, made our way to my car and all piled in.

The road stretched out like a ribbon of cracked asphalt, unraveling toward the horizon. Streetlights flickered above, their dim glow barely pushing back the encroaching darkness. The night felt heavier than usual. I kept one hand on the wheel, the other drumming anxiously on my thigh as Theo’s playlist hummed softly through the speakers.

Sasha sat beside me, leaning against the door with her arms crossed, her eyes scanning the passing trees as if expecting something to jump out. She hadn’t said much since we left. Typical. She always got quiet when she was thinking too hard.

Zoe was in the backseat, head tilted against the window, her eyes wide with wonder as she stared at the stars above. She was probably daydreaming again, lost in one of her imagined worlds where anything was possible. Her fingers traced absentmindedly over the condensation on the glass, sketching little spirals and stars.

“Are we even going the right way?” Theo’s voice cut through the quiet, a hint of unease creeping into his usually steady tone. He was in the backseat with Zoe, leaning forward just enough to see the dark road ahead.

“Relax, man,” I said, though I wasn’t entirely sure myself. “The GPS says we’re close.”

“Yeah, and it’s taken us halfway to the middle of nowhere,” Sasha muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

She wasn’t wrong. We had driven far beyond the outskirts of town, past neighborhoods we knew, past the old gas station that had been abandoned for years, and now… we were skirting the edge of nowhere. Trees pressed in on either side of the narrow road, their branches arching overhead like skeletal fingers. The air grew colder, more still, as if the world itself was holding its breath.

And then we saw it.

A soft glow, barely visible through the trees, pulsing like a heartbeat. Golden lights shimmered just beyond the line of the cornfield that stretched endlessly into the night. The stalks were dry and brittle, swaying slightly despite the absence of wind.

“There,” I said, more to myself than anyone else. My foot eased off the gas as I spotted the entrance.

A towering archway rose out of the darkness, impossibly ornate for something that hadn’t existed hours ago. The sign stretched across the top in curling, vintage script:

# The Carnival of Midnight

The letters glowed softly, their gold hue flickering like candlelight. Beneath the arch, the path leading in was lined with crimson banners that fluttered lazily despite the dead air. A wooden ticket booth stood just beyond the archway.

“This is… weird, right?” Theo asked, muttering his thoughts to the rest of us.

“Definitely weird,” Sasha muttered, her jaw tight as she scanned the scene with narrowed eyes.

Zoe, however, was already halfway out of the car. “Come on, guys,” she said softly, her voice full of awe. “Look how beautiful it is…”

Beautiful. That wasn’t the word I would’ve used. But there was something about it. Something that pulled at you.

I felt it too—a subtle tug, like invisible strings guiding me forward.

“Let’s just check it out,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “We came this far.”

Reluctantly, Sasha and Theo followed as we moved toward the ticket booth. Zoe, ever the dreamer, was already a few steps ahead, her eyes wide with wonder as the lights of the carnival reflected in her pupils.

The booth looked as old as the carnival itself—worn wood, chipping paint, and a glass window smudged with fingerprints. But it wasn’t empty.

A man stood behind the counter, and *God*, was he something out of a nightmare.

His grin was the first thing I noticed—*too* wide, stretching unnaturally across his gaunt face. His teeth were jagged, uneven, and yellowed, like they’d been filed down with a rusty blade. Deep-set eyes stared out from under a wild mop of unkempt hair, his pupils so dilated they practically swallowed the irises. His skin was pale, almost waxy, with veins that bulged at his temples.

And his clothes…

A patchwork suit stitched together from mismatched fabrics. Stripes, polka dots, and diamond patterns clashed violently, the fabric fraying at the edges. His sleeves were too long, hanging past where his hands should be, and his collar was stained a sickly brownish color.

But the worst part? His arms.

The sleeves hung loose because *there was nothing inside them*. His arms ended just above the elbows, but the way he moved made it seem like they were still there, invisible and twitching as if they were itching to grab something.

“Evan,” he rasped, his voice a wheezing, singsong melody that sent ice water down my spine. “Party of four.”

My head turned. Zoe froze mid-step. Theo’s hand instinctively went to my shoulder, and Sasha… I swear I saw her hand twitch toward her pocket, like she was ready to pull a knife she didn’t even have.

“Uh… how do you know my name?” I asked, trying to sound casual, but my voice betrayed me.

The carnie let out a shrill giggle that echoed far too long, like a distorted recording. “*Ohhh…*” His grin stretched wider—*too wide*. “We’ve been *waiting* for you.”

He leaned forward, pressing what was left of his arms against the counter, his hollow sleeves dragging along the wood.

“The Carnival of Midnight never forgets an invitation,” he whispered, his voice barely above the rustling of the cornfield behind us. “And we never… turn away our guests.”

The tickets were still sitting on the counter—four of them, fanned out like a deck of cards. The gold trim shimmered faintly, almost pulsing.

“What the hell is this?” Theo muttered under his breath.

“We should go,” Sasha whispered, her voice barely audible.

But Zoe…

“Guys…” Her voice was soft, almost hypnotized. She was staring at the tickets, her fingers just inches away from them.

“Take them,” the carnie urged, his grin never faltering. “The show is about to begin.”

A sickly sweet smell wafted from the booth—candy apples and something rotten beneath it.

My hand hovered over the tickets.

“Evan…” Theo’s tone was a warning, but it was already too late.

My fingers brushed the cool surface of the tickets.

“Enjoy the show,” the carnie whispered, his voice a twisted mockery of warmth.

As I grabbed the tickets, the lights beyond the archway brightened, flaring to life like fireworks in the night sky.

The *Carnival of Midnight* didn’t feel so bad at first. Actually… it was kind of awesome.

The moment we stepped inside, the air was filled with the sweet scent of kettle corn and cotton candy, swirling together with the faint crackle of distant fireworks. The lights overhead were dazzling—neon blues and purples that pulsed with an almost hypnotic rhythm. The sounds of laughter and carnival music drifted through the air, making it impossible not to feel a little excitement.

“Okay… this is cooler than I expected,” Theo said, his arms crossed but a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Zoe spun around, her eyes wide with wonder. “It’s magical,” she whispered, taking in the kaleidoscope of colors. “Like something out of a dream.”

“Or a fever dream,” Sasha muttered under her breath, but I caught the way her lips quirked up as she glanced at the crowd. Even she wasn’t immune to the charm of the place.

We started with the **Ferris wheel**. It was bigger than any I’d ever seen, towering over the rest of the carnival like some ancient guardian. As we climbed higher, the cool breeze brushed against our faces, carrying the distant hum of carnival sounds below.

“Damn,” I murmured, looking down at the maze of colorful tents and attractions. “This place is huge.”

“Feels like it goes on forever,” Theo said, his voice trailing off as he scanned the horizon.

Next was the carousel—but not your typical one. The horses were carved with intricate, lifelike detail, and they moved with a fluid grace that made it feel more like riding real animals than wooden figures. Zoe giggled the whole time, her hair flowing behind her as the carousel spun faster and faster.

“Okay, that was fun,” Sasha admitted afterward, brushing a strand of hair out of her face.

We took turns at the ring toss, where Theo showed off his uncanny aim**.** He nailed the first shot with casual precision, the ring clinking perfectly around the glass bottle’s neck. The second and third followed just as easily, like he’d been doing it his whole life. “Alright, hotshot,” I muttered, but Theo just grinned and pointed to the prizes.

“Pick one,” the carnie said, his grin a little too wide.

Theo’s eyes scanned the shelves before landing on the doll—small, porcelain, dressed in a tattered red dress. Something about it stood out. Without a second thought, he handed it to Sasha with a small, almost shy smile. He shot her a wink as he did so.

Sasha raised an eyebrow but took the doll, her fingers brushing his for a moment longer than necessary. “Thanks, Theo,” she murmured, her voice quieter than usual

I got a little too competitive at the hammer strength game, trying (and failing) to ring the bell at the top. Sasha tried her luck at skeebal**l** and nearly beat the high score, while Zoe dragged us to a fortune teller’s booth, where an elderly woman with cloudy eyes muttered something about *“a journey you can’t escape.”*

“Creepy,” Theo muttered as we walked away, but none of us took it seriously.

Time blurred as we bounced from one attraction to the next—bumper cars that sparked and screeched, a mirror maze where our reflections stretched and twisted in impossible ways, and a funhouse that left us breathless from laughter.

Even Sasha, who was usually the first to point out when something was off, seemed more at ease. I caught her grinning more than once, and she wasn’t even trying to hide it.

For a while… it was perfect.

“I hate to admit it,” I said, walking alongside the group with a contented sigh, “but this is actually pretty cool.”

“See? I told you,” Zoe said, practically skipping ahead of us. “Sometimes you just gotta believe in a little magic.”

“Magic, huh?” I smirked. “Or maybe just good marketing.”

Theo chuckled, nudging me with his elbow. “Whatever it is, I’m not complaining. We needed this.”

I almost forgot about the creepy carnie at the ticket booth. I almost forgot the unease I’d felt when we first walked in. The eerie fortune teller from earlier. Almost.

But then…

As we passed a row of game stalls, I saw him. Standing by the ticket booth, watching. I thought it was just another carnival worker at first until he came more into focus.

He was tall, draped in a crimson coat with gold embroidery, his presence too still, too deliberate. A black top hat sat atop his head, casting a shadow over his face, but I could still see his grin—wide and unnatural, teeth gleaming like ivory under the flickering carnival lights. His eyes, hollow and dark, locked onto mine with an intensity that made my chest tighten.

I blinked.

He was gone.

I shook it off. Just my imagination.

“Come on,” Theo said, breaking the moment. “Let’s hit one more ride before the main show starts.”

“Yeah,” I said, forcing a grin. “One more.”

But deep down… that uneasy feeling was back. And this time, it wasn’t going away.

We left the ring toss behind, the laughter and flashing lights fading as we wandered deeper into the carnival. The air grew heavier with the scent of burnt sugar and something… wrong underneath it, like metal and decay. The noise of the crowd dimmed as we approached the massive main tent, its striped fabric swaying gently even though there was no breeze.

**“**This is where the real show happens,**”** a voice echoed from somewhere unseen, playful but laced with something that made my skin crawl.

We didn’t question it. We just kept walking.

“Alright,” Theo murmured, his voice low. “Anyone else getting a weird vibe, or is it just me?”

“Definitely not just you,” Sasha said, her eyes darting around. She was holding the doll Theo had won, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that its painted eyes were watching us.

We stood near the main stage, a massive, ornate platform at the heart of the carnival. Golden lights rimmed the velvet curtains, but their glow felt dimmer now, like they struggled to hold back the surrounding darkness. A hush fell over the crowd as the lights dimmed even further, and that’s when he stepped forward.

The Ringmaster.

Tall and impossibly thin, he moved with a fluid grace, his crimson coat sweeping behind him like a cape. His suit was crimson and gold, immaculate but somehow… wrong, as if the fabric itself was stitched from something alive. A black top hat sat atop his head, casting a shadow that seemed deeper than it should’ve been, and his face—pale as bone, with a grin stretched impossibly wide—made it impossible to tell if he was amused or starving

“Ladies and gentlemen…” his voice echoed through the carnival, smooth as silk but with an undercurrent that sent a chill down my spine. “Welcome… to a night you’ll never forget.”

His eyes gleamed, and for a moment, I swore they locked onto me. But before I could react, he gestured dramatically toward the crowd.

**“**But first—**”** his voice rang out, “—let’s give a warm welcome to our first brave contestants of the night!”

A spotlight swung around, illuminating a group standing just a few yards away.

Another group of friends.

There were five of them—two guys, three girls—about our age, maybe a little older. They looked just as confused as we were, glancing at each other with nervous smiles, like they weren’t sure if they should be excited or terrified.

“Wait…” Zoe’s voice was barely above a whisper. “They’re… like us.”

“Of course, they are!” The Ringmaster spread his arms wide, grinning as if he’d read her thoughts. “Each of you accepted our *special invitation*. But I’m afraid none of you truly understood what you stepped into tonight.”

The crowd around us murmured, but there was something… *off*. I noticed it then—the audience wasn’t real. The people cheering and clapping weren’t people at all. Their faces were blurred, distorted like bad reflections in a funhouse mirror. My stomach dropped.

“What the hell…” Theo whispered.

“Tonight,” the Ringmaster continued, pacing along the edge of the stage, “you are all bound to the carnival. None of you can leave until you’ve played the games…” His grin stretched wider. “And won.”

“What happens if they lose?” I whispered to Theo before I could stop myself.

The Ringmaster’s smile deepened. “Ah…” His eyes twinkled with something dark. “Why don’t we show you?”

The five strangers were ushered down to the main stage by carnies whose eyes were too dark. The first game was simple—a maze of mirrors where they had to find the exit before the time ran out. I watched, breathless, as they navigated the twisting glass corridors. They had five minutes. They beat the timer by less than thirty seconds.

“Not bad,” the Ringmaster purred, his tone dripping with amusement. “But that was just the warm-up.”

The second game was worse. A test of trust**.** Each of the friends had to walk a narrow plank over a pit of darkness while blindfolded. One friend was allowed to walk infront, guiding the others with her voice and hand without having to wear a blindfold herself.

The first two made it. The third wobbled but barely caught herself.

But the fourth…

A scream.

The plank gave way beneath her feet, and before any of us could react—the ground split open.

Clawed hands—black as tar and writhing with sinew—shot up, grabbing her by the ankles and dragging her down. Her screams echoed in the night as the darkness swallowed her whole.

“NO!” at his friend’s cries he tore his blindfold off, reaching for her… only to be yanked down himself by another set of grasping claws for breaking the rules.

Two gone. Just like that.

The rest of the group was frozen in horror, but the Ringmaster clapped, his grin revealing horrid teeth.

“Ah, but we’re not done yet,” he purred. **“**For the final game,**”** the Ringmaster purred, **“**we’re going to play something… classic.**”**

The crowd stirred as a massive game booth was wheeled into the center of the tent. The booth looked old—paint peeling, wood splintered, and the bright colors long faded to dull, sickly hues**.** Rows of carnival prizes lined the shelves—stuffed animals with hollow, dead eyes, glass jars filled with murky liquids, and dolls that looked almost… too lifelike.

“Step right up,” the Ringmaster announced, his voice dripping with malicious glee. “It’s time for… Knock **‘**Em Dead.**”**

Three sets of metal milk bottles stood stacked in pyramids on the booth’s worn surface. Each set was slightly different. One was painted blood-red, the other black, and the last one a sickly green.

**“**The rules are simple,**”** the Ringmaster said, twirling a brightly colored baseball in his gloved hand. **“**You get three balls each. That’s nine total. Knock down all three sets of bottles…and you’re free to go.”

**“**That’s it?**”** one of the remaining friends asked, voice shaking.

**“**That’s it.” The Ringmaster tossed the ball toward him. **“**Oh… but I forgot to mention…**”**

The three friends approached the booth, each grabbing a ball. That’s when they saw it. Faces. Two of the faces were of the friends they had just lost. Trapped inside the bottles. Their eyes were wide with silent screams, mouths contorted in agony.

**“**Miss…**”** The Ringmaster tapped his cane against the ground, and the faces twisted in torment. “…and they stay trapped forever.”

**“**We can do this,**”** one of the group whispered, trying to convince himself as much as the others. They each took aim. The first throws were too weak**.** The bottles barely budged**,** and the faces inside screamed soundlessly.

**“**Harder!**”** one cried, her eyes wild with desperation.

They threw again—harder this time.

One pyramid of bottles toppled.

They threw their final set each. One hit the second stack dead center… but only the top bottle fell.

**“**No…**”** one of them muttered, his voice trembled as the last grains of hope slipped away.

One of the girl’s  throw went wide, missing the third set entirely.

“No, no, no!” The ground beneath them rumbled. The faces behind the glass—so close to freedom— let out a final, silent scream. 

The friends screamed as the ground opened beneath them, sucking them down into the depths.

The Ringmaster clapped slowly.

“What a shame,**”** he said, “but hey… you gave it your best shot.”

The Ringmaster’s voice rang out, cutting through the thick air of the circus tent. “Step forward, my brave souls! It’s time to play the first game. Will you succeed? Or will you fail?”

I held my breath as The Ringmaster set his eyes on us...
