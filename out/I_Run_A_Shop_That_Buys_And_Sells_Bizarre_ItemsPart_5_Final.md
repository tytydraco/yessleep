Well, *that* was an experience. 

After enduring an onslaught of the Vagrant’s deranged laughter and incessant knocking, I decided that enough was enough. I drew the pistol, bringing several clips with me, as well as grabbing the box and a couple of other things I would need.

Before I go any further, it's probably time I explained the properties of this pistol. One, it's a “smart” weapon, i.e., its ammo will seek out their target or targets if the user can see them clearly and it can point at targets I’ve lost track of. Two, users can change the kind of ammo it fires. If they want hollowpoints, armor-piercing, incendiary, or almost any other kind of bullet. Three, once it's struck an enemy, it doesn’t matter what they are. Angel, demon, vampire, fed--they’ll die. The catch is that it forms a kind of bond with the user, and as a consequence, the wielder can sometimes see flashes of the memories of previous people, seeing who they killed, feeling their pain, remorse, stress, etc. Remember back at the very beginning, when Booth’s pistol was brought in? That’s what I mean. It can be useful to hear from previous shop owners what sorts of trouble they experienced and how to avoid it. The more stressed the user is, the more frequent these visions become, and the more likely it is for the user to experience their negative emotions more intensely, or even forget who they are, having their minds lost amidst an endless sea of echoes. 

With all of that said, I knew that I needed to go into that warehouse with my head cool and my conscience clear. Using instructions given to me by Mr. A, I used the other phrase for lockdown procedures: “Beginning maintenance.” The slab in front of the warehouse door slid away. By this time, the knocking from the Vagrant had stopped. I think I’d injured its pride by suggesting that it was afraid, so it wanted me to come in. After hearing whines from Cerberus, I patted him on the middle head, assuring him that I’d be back in a few minutes, then I opened the door and entered, aiming the gun ahead of me. The warehouse had changed. It wasn’t a warehouse any longer; now it was a strange, infinite void similar to what I witnessed with the Proprietor’s “world.” The difference was that this place seemed to be vantablack, except even that wouldn’t be accurate, as I could see in it just fine somehow (probably the Proprietor’s work, to create a void for the Vagrant to enter and be trapped in). And what I saw was disturbing, to say the least. 

People. People of many races and species, all standing still, all covered in the same black substance on the Vagrant. As I took a good look at them, all of their eyes snapped open, and their expressions contorted into unnatural, malicious smiles. Among them, I even saw many creatures identical to the same one I had encountered the first time. The black slime leaked from between their teeth, but there were those who seemed to have less of the slime visible. Past all of them was something that seemed darker than the atmosphere around me, except this was different. I could see it moving, pulsing, and writhing. It was a living darkness, not a mere absence of light. 

Suddenly, something made sense. The Pr’mAtrian had none of the slime on them until I shot them. I had never encountered the Vagrant in its true form. I had only encountered its puppets. It had been working on a way to get into the shop in a way that would leave behind little-to-no trace. They (or rather, it) seemed to sense this revelation, because immediately the puppets began to laugh. “What do you think?” one of them said, before another snapped, “Are *you* scared yet, you little shit?!” “Believe it or not,” said one of the human vessels, “this body used to belong to the previous shop owner.” “Why not just let me in?” This last voice sounded unlike the others, deep, commanding, vicious, and yet at the same time calm, reassuring, and I could “hear” it in my mind, just like with the Proprietor, only it was a lot more painful, like a million tiny drills were burrowing into my skull directly into my brain. “I just want to reunite with Them. They and I have some outstanding business to settle; you needn’t be part of it. All you need to do is allow me access to the shop. Come now, be reasonable.” 

Even as it was saying this, I looked up from where I had fallen due to the pain, and saw its puppets were now crowded around me, beginning to reach for me with black ooze dripping from their fingers. Through the pain, I drew the pistol and fired at the previous shop owner. The rest of the puppets cried out in agony, and the drilling ceased. I stood up, then aimed at the group. By this point, they were beginning to recover from the collective pain, and they glared at me, eyes blazing with hate. I knew that as useful as the gun was, it wouldn’t be enough. Luckily, I had a Plan B. I withdrew the bell I used for calling Cerberus, then rang it nine times. The dog bounded into the void room, then as he was running, began to change his size. In three seconds, he was at least seven feet tall, and his three heads were snapping and ripping at the puppets. Some of them tried to attack him or infect him, but the black ooze just slid off of him, causing him to turn his attention to another. As he did so, I shot several others, some bursting into flames and instantly fading away. Rather anticlimactically, the entire host of puppets was disposed of in less than a minute, and to say the Vagrant was displeased was an understatement. I could hear the abomination making strange noises like a hissing screech. It was more comprehensible in my mind yet again, where it was shrieking, *You son of a bitch! You just couldn’t--* 

“Can you just shut the hell up?” I growled, taking out the box. The formless shadow at the end of the “room” shuddered. *No,* it whispered, then began frantically pleading. *Nonononono! I can’t-- Don’t put me in a form I can’t control! You don’t know what it's like to not exist while everything else does! Please! Don’t!* I thought back to the Pr’mAtrian, those agonized, metallic screeches. I wondered if they had begged it in a similar way to leave it alone, to remove its presence from its mechanical body. I began turning the box, prompting a strange light to emit from it. The shifting and shuddering became more violent as I kept twisting. 

The Vagrant, realizing that I wasn’t about to bargain with it, began cursing me in many languages, then at the end, laughing defiantly. *You think I’m the only thing born of the Void?!* it hissed. *My brethren will know what you’ve done! I was kind enough to try to snuff out that machine’s consciousness, along with the rest of them! The others will make sure you see what they make you do! They--* “Shut. Up.” I gave the last twist, then the box began moving on its own, absorbing the monstrosity’s formless being as it kept laughing in defiance. When it was done, I stood in the warehouse as it reformed around me while I held the box. I then patted Cerberus on one of his heads before he shrunk, then we re-entered the shop. I obeyed the Proprietor’s instructions, leaving the box with them. 

*Well done/Good job. We/the Proprietor will keep Form/Prison/Jar of Vagrant/Vandal here. Friends close, enemies closer. That is all/Thank you/Back to work.*

And so just like that, I was back in business. I know, again, anticlimactic. Still, as scary and dangerous as the Vagrant was, it was really little more than a pest or mold infesting the shop. I will say, though, I think things have just begun. I got a call a few hours ago. The only thing I heard on the line was a strange, inhuman voice that sounded similar to the Vagrant’s. This one sounded a lot angrier, though, if that was even possible. I immediately slammed the phone on its cradle. 

I don't know what the near future holds in store--no pun intended--for the Emporium and me, but as long as I’m able, I’m going to keep running the place as instructed. This isn’t goodbye, just a “See you later.” Thanks to everyone for reading my accounts. If any of the Vagrant’s “family” come calling, you guys--after Mr. A, naturally--will be the first to know. In the meantime, I have a customer to attend to.
