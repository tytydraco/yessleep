 It is the first house I've ever bought. What many of my friends consider a great achievement for someone in their late twenties. But, I suspect it'll be the last house I ever buy. 

There's something not right about this house. I should have trusted my gut when I saw that strange little space in the basement. It's not big enough to be considered a room, and it's the wrong height to be a closet of some kind. Perhaps it held some sort of heating unit or something in the long past? The house is mostly new. But I say mostly because it was built over the foundations of an older house. So that space was probably part of the older building. Despite it being empty, the walls made of whitewashed concrete, with some odd orange scaffolding crisscrossing through it, it felt oddly inhabited. Standing close to it made me feel like a small dog picking up the territorial marking scent of a wolf.

But the price was so good I ignored my instincts. 

The agent told me the owner had suddenly received new job opportunity across town and didn't want to spend three hours driving to and fro from work everyday. They were looking to sell fast, and if I could get past the minor fix ups I would have to do, this was a steal in up and coming real estate with several schools and shopping malls planned to be built within a fifteen minute drive. How could I pass up this opportunity? I told myself when I got the finances together, I could just seal up the creepy basement space. Part of me knew I would never really get round to that. More likely I would just let it sit there and never enter the basement.

I have survived here for a year, six months, and twelve days now, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. And no, I can't just leave. One of them appear attached to me and I'm scared if I move, it'll follow me. Then I'll have to set up a new routine to keep it at bay. Or failing that, well, I have no idea what it does when it catches up. And I have no intention of finding out.

Yes, fine. I admit I have one of those personality types where I leave things be until I really need to deal with them. But I've made it this far in life. Leave me be.

It began, as many of these things do, with knocking in the walls. I thought it was just creaks of wood and the house settling. What else could it be?

That is until my friend came over to stay one night. I'm an introvert, so holding a house party was an unattractive prospect. But my extrovert adopter, Vivian, had been very excited for my first house purchase, and having disappointed her regarding the lack of house party, I made her the consolation prize of being the first guest to sleepover. 

I had only stayed in the house for two weeks then. A lot of things were still in boxes and I hadn't shopped for much furniture. But after a simple dinner, we made ourselves cozy with sleeping bags, nachos, soft drinks, and my brand new television. We were in the middle of a good old conversation, when the knocking came. Vi sat up straight with her eyes scanning the ceiling as if looking for the source. 

I stared at her quizzically.

Suddenly she asked loudly, "Anyone there?"

We stayed silent. Just as I was about to say something, several knocks came sounding. She broke into a half grin.

"What are you doing?" I asked her. 

"Didn't you notice?" She said, eyes still scanning the ceiling, "That rapping sound."

"Yes… I've heard it ever since I moved in. Just the house settling."

"It sounds like it's been trying to participate in our conversation," Vi said.

I hadn't noticed the knocking while we had been talking the last three hours. But then, the odd knocks had become somewhat background noise to me. It was about eleven at night, and the hair on my neck was standing. I don't do well with spooky things. The last horror movie I'd watched years before had kept me awake for three weeks and I swore never again.

"Can we not test this?" I squeaked. But I could see Vi had that look in her eye, and I had never successfully dissuaded Vi from doing anything. 

"One for yes, two for no?" she persisted calling out loudly to the ceiling, then leaned over to me completely ignorant of my wide-eyed discomfort and whispered, "I watched this in a documentary once. A family communicated with a spirit in their house this way."

"What happened to the family?" I asked not sure if I wanted to know. 

A sharp rap from the ceiling was my reply.

"Nope!" I announced standing up. "No. No. No. And No. We are leaving this instant." I resolutely stood up, prepared to get into a pair of jeans, grab my keys, and go somewhere. Anywhere. Late hour be damned.

Vi snorted and laughed at me. "Don't be silly. Okay, okay. We won't continue. You haven't had any bad experiences here for the last couple of weeks, right?"

"No," I answered slowly, relieved she was going to stop whatever the heck was going on. And it was true. I hadn't actually gotten the creeps or any nightmares since moving in.

"Then it's just some creaking right? Even if it is something," she said, and I winced at the thought, "it's friendly." 

"Okay," I relented, "but any further knocking or seeking a response and we are going to stay over at yours for the night." She smiled and placated me with a hand on my arm. We had one of those platonic relationships always on the verge of turning into something more, but never doing so as other love interests drew us away from each other.

We spent the remainder of the night watching videos on the internet till we dozed off on the floor in our sleeping bags around two in the morning. There were no more knocks I heard that night.

I woke up the next day from the sunlight pouring into the room. I rolled over wondering what time it was and realizing Vi wasn't in her sleeping bag. I listened out for water running from the bathroom or the shower but didn't hear any. No sounds from the kitchen either. Puzzled I fumbled for my glasses and dragged myself to my feet.

I found her outside still in her jammies sitting on the porch step. She had her chin in her hands staring at the grass by the pavement. She had her car keys, phone, and purse by her side.

"Hey, what's going on?"

She turned and gave me a small smile, then asked if we could go grab brunch somewhere. I replied sure, went back in, and did a quick change. Just before I got out, she poked her head in the door and asked me if I didn't mind grabbing the rest of her stuff. I didn't question her, although feeling a bit off about the abrupt end to the stay over. Grabbing her day clothes and toiletry bag, I headed out. 

She drove in her pajamas over to her place some twenty minutes away, then went in to change. I waited for her in the car. We hadn't said anything much to each other as we had driven. I knew when she was ready she would tell me what was going on.

We went to a nearby café, one of our regular haunts. As we settled down to our meal she finally confessed, she had gone and communicated further with the knocking early in the morning while I slept. I gave a deep groan and put my head in my hands. I was annoyed but I could rarely remain angry with Vivian. 

“Vi, of all things. Why? I live there alone and I spook easy.”

“I’m sorry. I had totally forgotten about it by morning but right as I finished brushing my teeth and stepped out into the corridor I heard the tapping.”

“Okay," I said taking a breath, "Are you sure I want to hear this?”

“I,” and she hesitated, "I kind of need you to hear this.” I sat up hearing the askance for help in my friends voice. 

“Go on, then,” I sighed.

“Look, in the documentary I watched, it was about three girls in the 1800s or something who claimed that their house was haunted by a spirit who let them predict the future. The spirit would communicate via knocks. One for yes. Two for no. They turned the whole thing into a fortune telling business. Some say they were eventually outed, with people discovering hidden devices under their kitchen table where they held séances, to create the rapping noises. Of course, others still believe it to be a true story." She shifted nervously. "So, I thought, I’d ask if the knocking knew the future.”  
As easily as I spook, I raised my eyebrow incredulously. “You’re joking right? It didn’t actually predict something?”

“Well, not exactly. Not right away,” She had her arms folded and was staring at the floor. “I asked if it could tell me the future. And it answered yes. But I didn’t ask about the future to test it at first. I started by asking how many boyfriends I’ve had. It answered six by knocking that many times.”

“You’ve had five.”

“Well, technically I’ve had six. I just never count the first one as a real boyfriend.”

“Okay. Creepy but not beyond coincidence.”

“Well then I asked for my street number. It rapped three times, four times, then seven times. And I guess that is correct. Unit 3. Number 47. So… so I was convinced.” She fell quiet.

“Then what?”

“Then,” Vi whispered. “I asked when I would die.”

“YOU WHAT?”

She sighed. “Look, I just thought it wouldn’t be that serious a question.”

“Which part of knowing when you are going to die is not serious?” I cried in apoplexy. I closed my eyes, and took a very deep breath. “Okay. I get it. It was surreal. This sort of thing doesn’t happen. You got caught in the moment as if this were one of those internet sites where they tell you your death date.” Another deep breath. “Then what happened?”

She looked like she was about to cry. “Well it didn’t answer at first. So I thought… I thought I was being clever. I asked how many decades I had left. There was no response. So I asked how many years. Still no response. Months? Nothing. Weeks? Nothing. And then I asked how many days I had left.”

I held my breath.

“Four,” she said.

Like I said, I spook easily. And obviously, I have a soft spot for Vi, inclination for trying to communicate recklessly with the supernatural notwithstanding. So, we made a plan. The few people I’ve told this to have laughed, but it’s what really happened. 

We asked ourselves how could we avoid as many horror movie tropes as possible? 

Firstly, I decided I was not going to stay at my house for the next few days. Instead I would stay with Vi for the whole week. I worked from home, so there was no big deal where I was staying, as long as I had my laptop. 

Secondly, we got into a bit of a debate of exactly what four days meant? Was that morning day one? Or was it day zero? Were we counting in hours from the time Vi asked the question? Just to accommodate for all timing contingencies, we decided that days three, four, and five, we would be strictly stay in Vi’s unit. We would stock up on groceries and supplies and order food in if we had to. Pandemic lockdown training, right? Vi was still at university, so she would miss a lab class, but could get all her lectures and assignments online. 

Thirdly, on day four, the most likely day of the prediction, a Thursday, we would invite as many friends over as possible for dinner and board games. Really push the vibe as far away from spooky as possible. Also we would have the safety of company and numbers.

We figured if she was going to die from something medical and sudden, then fine, nothing we could do to prevent it. But we would reduce the chances of anything supernatural as much as possible by doing this. Probably drawing inspiration from too many horror movies, but it didn’t feel too silly at that time.

We went back to mine later that day. Vi wouldn’t enter my house, but I steeled myself to grab whatever I needed as fast as I could. I did hear the creaking a couple of times. Really gave me a good jolt when I heard a sudden snap overhead in the bathroom. But I kept telling myself, I didn’t have to respond to it. And if I didn’t respond to it then it would leave me to do my thing as I had been all this time. Also, this was ridiculous and surely Vi’s experience was some incredulous example of coincidence.

We had quite an unremarkable week all things considered. As the fourth day came and went, Vivian was still alive. I had kept her within view most of the day. We spent the evening in the midst of the board games and good company, so we barely noticed when the clock passed midnight. Nothing even remotely dangerous or creepy had occurred. Then the fifth day passed without incident, and we allowed ourselves to giggle nervously at how we had behaved that week. She was even beginning to act tough. But I know she had believed things enough to call her mother, who she has serious issues with, during the week, just in case.

By the sixth day, Saturday, I decided I should head back. I couldn’t stay at her apartment forever and we were both beginning to need our own spaces. But I’ll admit it: I was still spooked. 

It was evening when I arrived home. I was about to prepare dinner when I heard a rap. 

Something in me, roused. An emotion akin to anger. Assertiveness? I had spent an entire week fearful and dedicated to the crazy notion, that the knocking sound might have been a real supernatural thing. I was tired in a way, and aside from seriously considering selling a house I had just moved into because it creaked occasionally, I decided I was just going to have to get over myself and prove it was all rubbish.

“Hello?” I said. My voice did not sound as brave as I wanted it to be. There was no response. “Was that - you?”

There was a very loud creak that made me jump.

“Okay,” I gasped, trying to gain control of my breathing. I could feel the blood drain out of my face. “I-if you are real, can we make a deal.”

A knock.

“I don’t ever want to see what you are. I never want to get any sense of your presence, aside from the knocking. And in return I don’t do anything about you. Is that possible?” Even today, I can hardly believe I was able to muster that. And yes, I realize that my proposal was not really a sensible trade of any kind. But let's see *you* do better in such a situation.

A knock.

It agreed? “O-okay, cool." 

Then I took a deep breath not believing that I was actually communicating with this thing. "And uhh… last thing I ever want to ask you, why did you tell my friend she was going to die in four days?”

Four sharp raps followed by several long creaks. Was it laughing? The prolonged sounds made me seize up and I fought the instinct to just get the hell out of my house and drive to my parents.

“You were joking?” I stammered.

A knock.

“Alright. Alright. But no more jokes. Okay? This is. This is really all I can handle.”

Silence.

It remained silent for the rest of the evening. I don’t believe I’d ever been so scared and so brave in my life that weekend. I went about life, shutting every open door to empty rooms, turning on every single light, and having lots of music on to change the mood. But I would play the music only on speakers not earphones because I wanted to hear if anything was coming. There were creaks now and then, but they could truly have been the house settling. Or perhaps, just my housemate minding its own business?

I never told anybody, but I did give the presence a nickname. I call it Knocks. And it would turn out to be the friendliest of the five entities that presented in my house. I haven't even told you fully about the basement space yet.

And for the love of everything good, if you're in a creaky house, please don't ask it questions. Especially if the house isn't yours!
