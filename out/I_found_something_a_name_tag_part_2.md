I know that it has been a while since the  [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11vqyks/i_found_something_part_1/) post, it’s getting harder and harder to focus on the repair, nothing seems to be wrong with the computer, except those roms, they don’t seem to contain basic as they should, only the text editor, I don’t have any chip reader though so I don’t know exactly what is and what isn’t in there though, it’s just strange.

But I’m getting ahead of myself, after the computer first turned off by itself, it just didn’t want to turn back on, like it has a mind of its own and it wasn’t ready to reveal all its secrets yet… until just now… this time the machine didn’t cycle through any colors, it just booted back into the text editor. I’ll continue to just read and copy over to my phone whatever it says on the screen.

I think I’ve found a clue to what the writers of the code I found wanted to do with it, there was a small paper note inside the sleeve for the program that just said “Subliminal test 1” I think that they wanted to get their customers to be more addicted to their machines, but I don’t feel more addicted, I just feel… trapped inside this building, I also feel like there is something in here with me, like it’s hiding in the shadows or looking at me around the corners, and every time I try to leave to get help I just blank out, the only clues I get to what’s happening are these strange new log entries.

Like this one I found : 

Don’t try to run, you will only make it worse.. soon I’ll take over and you can’t stop it.

I mustered up some courage and I went back down into the basement, I really should fix those stairs, they creek something awfully each time I take a step, and I’m afraid that whatever is in here with me, is hiding in the basement, just waiting to attack me.

But as I reached the bottom of the stairs, I turned on the lights and at first glance I found everything to look perfectly normal, except that my toolbox was missing, it was one of those big ones that sits on wheels and you can conveniently roll around on the floor, I had painted it in my favorite color, dark blue, instead of the awful greenish yellow color it had when I bought it, it was really awkward to get it down here because of its size and weight, but with the help of a friend, we had managed it in the end.

The basement itself was pretty small, there was just enough room for my workbench, my toolbox, my bicycle and other random stuff that you would find in a normal basement, the workbench was a mess as usual, I normally use it to make small wooden figurines as gifts to my friends and family, I think they pretend to  like them since I’m not very good at woodworking, but hey, if you don’t practice, you’ll never get good right ?

I made an empty smile thinking of what I should maybe work on next was, since I seem to be stuck here anyway, but the thought of cleaning the workbench up enough to work there and the headache that was slowly building due to that thought put a real damper on that idea. I turned around to turn off the lights and head back up the stairs when I noticed something on the floor that shouldn’t have been there. A small brown thin square.. hmm I reached down to pick it up to get a better look at it “a name tag” I said to myself, as I held the leathery piece in my hand.

I flipped it over and read the name “Amanda”, feeling the slow inklings of fear building in my gut, realizing that what I had previously seen in the basement couldn’t have been a simple nightmare, what then felt like a strong electric shock jolting through my entire body, it was over in just two seconds though, but during those two I also had a vision ? Maybe a memory ? I don’t know what, but what I saw in it was horrifying, was the poor lady from the hospital… Amanda… again, I couldn’t see much of her more then her small gold chain around her neck and her long curly ash brown hair. She was tied down on the toolbox again, her bare back visible, her breathing was fast and erratic, almost panting, no sounds could be heard though, I saw a hand reach for a scalpel.

It started cutting several small C shapes into her skin, her pain being quite visible by her jolting and reacting to every single little slice, the hand folded her wounded skin over and poured what looked like salt straight into it, she reacted violently to it, the poor woman, it must’ve hurt really badly, when she seemed to calm down a little bit though, the hand squirted a clear yellowish liquid from a syringe straight into it as well, another really strong reaction from her body almost vibrating the entire toolbox. After this had been repeated several times, her body didn’t react much longer, like she had accepted the pain, or was too exhausted to even try to react any longer, the hand then used medical tape to seal everything in… the worst part is… it looked like my hand, but I didn’t recognize it.

That was more than enough to snap me out of it and sent me flying back up the stairs in a sprint that was almost too fast for my own legs, and right at the last step, the staircase made a huge cracking sound as the step gave weight and made me fall headfirst onto the floor in the hallway, and for a split second it looked like the walls were bleeding, like they had a fleshy texture seeping blood from the cracks in the walls.

I just had to stop reading there, my head started pounding really bad, my gut felt like it was ready to turn inside out, and damn I’m tired, it feels like I haven’t slept in days, I’m going to go splash some water on my face and drink something and see if I feel any better after.. I’m also worried that the code this guy is talking about in the log might have snuck its way into the roms, I did see the cycling colors that he was talking about after all…. But this is a commodore not an Atari, it should not be able to run on this machine… like at all… unless… it adapts… I’m going to have to do some research on it, what do you all think this code does ? If I can find it in the machine, will I be able to reverse engineer it ? We will see, first I need some sleep…
