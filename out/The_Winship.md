There's a certain area of the Catskills that is hard to locate but that certain unlucky hikers happen upon from time to time.

At this place, the trees seem to exist in a perpetual state of decay, even during the sunniest, most flowery spring. The ground is gripped with weeds and littered with brown plastic bottles and sticky candy wrappers, and you'll rarely if ever spot any wildlife there. Sometimes, you might see a lone crow perched upon some high, precarious branch, and it'll stare at you perfectly still and quiet, seeming to warn you with its beady black eyes that you ought not venture any farther.

When most people find this place, they know instinctively to turn around. They'll have some sort of sensation--something like a chilly wind blowing cold, wet leaves onto their neck--and they'll find themselves deeply uneasy. They'll perceive the eerie stillness of the place, they'll experience a feeling like they are standing in the woods in the middle of the night even if it's the brightest morning hour. And they turn away.

But not all do.

If you decide to push onward from this point, you'll have to fight through a dense thicket of forest before eventually reaching a clearing--a wide expanse of flat land that might have been the sight of some Puritan settlement that stood more than two hundred years ago, only to be swallowed by the wilderness and lost to time.

You'll see five or six stone chimneys standing alone, spaced fairly evenly apart. The wooden houses they once belonged to are all long gone, lost to fire from lightning strikes or simple rot from lack of upkeep. In place of these houses, the land is now dotted with primitive little huts made of sticks and mud, erected by the people who currently live there. If you search the grounds, you'll find artifacts like a metal lock that perhaps once joined together the wooden framework of a pillory--something that the "village" for lack of a better descriptor didn't have any need for nowadays....

If you continue to explore this place, eventually you'll be surprised to come across a tall, imposing edifice: a whitewashed and steepled church, standing in the midst of the clearing, sturdy and pristine even though it would seem no one is around to care for it. How it managed to survive for centuries while the other buildings in the area seemed to easily give way to the elements no one in the village could ever figure out. I heard various rumors about this church when I was a member of the village myself. It is said that it once doubled as a school and that around the late 1700s, an itinerant teacher (some say Irving's inspiration for Ichabod Crane) once taught there before he was summarily deposed and fatally mauled by the Winship, who has since called the church his home.

The Winship is no headless horseman. He is no bigfoot, no Jersey devil, no skunk-ape, no hog-bear. He isn't even a Rawhead or a Bloody Bones. And I don't *think* he's a Wendigo either. Rather, he's a creature with the body of a man, standing a little over six feet tall, weighing probably a little over 200 pounds. He has long, slender arms that are oddly stiff, as if carved from wood, and they are totally black, as if covered in soot. His hands are tiny and always grabbing and reaching and fidgeting, like the hands of a tricky, conniving little gremlin or raccoon. His legs likewise are slender, but I never saw what they looked like, for he always wore navy dress pants to match his navy suit. Where he got this suit no one in the village really knew, but it was so modern-looking, we all figured he must have grabbed it off some hapless victim who wandered into his domain not very long ago. But then again, who hikes in the Catskills wearing such formal attire?

The Winship's head is like that of a fox--or, perhaps, it's like that of a wolf if a wolf had bitten into an can of orange spray paint and found his fur permanently stained. Or maybe the head was more similar to some orange coyote's or maybe even a hyena. It's hard to say. Really, it resembled the head of no other animal on earth, but a fox or wolf or some sort of vicious canid with unnaturally bright, fiery orange fur is the best way I can describe it.

Most of the people in the village were born there, with no outside knowledge of the world. However, some of the members of the village are outsiders, like I was. I came upon the Winship's domain when I was a young man newly-graduated from Columbia. I'd devised a hiking trip in the Catskills ahead of starting my career, and I wound up trapped under the Winship's rule for years. I was one of the last "immigrants," as it were, that the Winship accepted into his little country, for over time, he'd built up a sizable group of worshipers who'd multiplied by inbreeding and he soon decided there was no need to let anyone else in.

The Winship liked me, I'm deeply ashamed to admit, because, in order to preserve myself, I became close to him and helped him keep the people in line. How he kept the people in line was by turning them against each other, for he knew that if they ever collaborated, they had the potential to overthrow him. 

For example, one day the Winship and I met in his church, and he squawked at me in his loud voice that was rough and sounded a lot like the cry of a bird of prey mixed with some sort of strange dinosaurian roar. He told me that he was angry at some of the first-generation villagers, the ones who'd come from the outside, because they were teaching their children not to be racist. Little boys, when they'd come across one of the village's few Black members, would cry, with genuine terror, "It's a bear-man, mommy!" spraying spittle everywhere because too much inbreeding had made their mouths oddly shaped and unable to properly hold all of their teeth. And the haggard mothers would say, speaking slowly and lifelessly, "Now, now, Donnie, that isn't nice to say" or "Now, now, Johnny, that nice man ain't no bear." And the Winship simply couldn't have this. So, he told me something had to be done to keep the distraction of racism alive and well so the people would never get ideas to work together against him.

So, the Winship, in the dead of night, slunk into the woods and killed and skinned a black bear. Then, he dressed me in the bear's fur and had me loot the huts of every white member of the village, stealing their weekly rations of berries and deer meat and anything else they happened to hold dear. I remember vividly finding artifacts from some of the people's old lives: hiking gear; slips of green paper depicting George Washington that now, simply because they were in a new place, held no value; and even one or two dead smartphones that seemed to have indentions in them from people gripping them so hard, perhaps using them as mirrors, desperately searching for their old selves by looking through a glass darkly, or maybe imagining the photos of loved ones that used to be stored in their camera rolls.

As you can imagine, my plundering in my bearskin suit caused quite the panic, and the morning after, when all the people's treasures were hidden in the Winship's church, he screamed that a certain Black member of the village was to blame: a man called Lloyd, if I recall. In an instant, most every white member of the village turned on Lloyd, and the ones who didn't at first felt compelled to. They took stones and threatened to pelt Lloyd with them unless he gave them their goods back. I remember the animal fear in his eyes clear as day, him madly stammering that he hadn't taken anything from anyone and trembling like a rabbit cornered by a fox. Seeing Lloyd was weak and vulnerable, the Winship lunged forward, caught him by the throat, hurdled him to the ground, and stamped upon his head, crushing it like a melon until blood gushed from his nose and ears. He continued his stamping, moving to Lloyd's neck, and pounding into it as he screamed until his screaming finally died and his breathing ceased. After that, every other Black member of the village fled in fear, escaping into the woods, taking their chances with whatever beast lay beyond, for none could be as horrible as the Winship. And just like that, there were significantly fewer people who could stand up to the Winship. And for a while, he was pleased with this.

But then, one day, he reasoned that there were still a good number of people left who could revolt against him. He thought about the upcoming winter, which was sure to be harsh, and how, despite his efforts to keep the village members safe from the cold in his church, several of the weaker ones would die off. He discussed with me if this was something he wanted, but then it dawned on him, mid-conversation, that if everyone was gone, he'd had no one left to worship him. I told him, a bit sheepishly, that he'd always have me. And then I frowned and felt my stomach drop, realizing just how nightmarish a scenario that would be. 

"Sure, sure," the Winship pouted. "But I always want a *crowd* you know. A big, big *crowd* full of people who *love* me! Who love me and who look and act just *like* me!"

The Winship then hugged himself and cooed while he swayed back and forth. Then, in the next moment, he hatched an idea as to how to create more people that loved him--not just loved him, but *looked* like him. And *acted* like him. That's what he wanted. The reason why was clear to me from the moment he expressed this wish: he wanted to love as well as to be loved, and he knew well that the only other person he could ever love was someone exactly like himself.

This was his genius new plan: impregnate the women himself. All of them. Being an educated man, I had doubts that this would work. The women were human and he...well, he was...*not*. But that didn't seem to matter to him. The Winship announced his plan the following morning, telling every woman in the village that it would be a great honor and privilege to carry his child. The women, however, were unconvinced. Few gave in. Those who didn't, the Winship ordered me and a few other of his trusted confidants to capture if they attempted escape. I was reluctant to do so, to say the least, but I ended up not having to, for the Winship managed to reach down and ferociously grab any woman who attempted to flee from him. I heard their shrieks. I heard their wails of agony. I heard their lives, already plenty hellish, suddenly changed forever and exponentially worsened. And I did nothing. What could I do? I was but one man.

Whether the Winship succeeded in getting these women pregnant I don't know. But something did happen in the course of all this horror that helped catalyze my escape. The Winship pinned down someone whom he took to be another woman as the whole village gazed on. But in a matter of moments, he realized he was really sinking his claws into a long-haired man wearing a flowing garment that could easily have been mistaken for a dress--perhaps something he found discarded in the woods, perhaps something from the outside world one of the first-generation villagers had dropped somewhere. Before this, no one had ever bothered this individual for wearing what he chose or keeping his hair at the length he preferred, but after he "humiliated" the Winship, many of those who had given themselves over the Winship's lies, turned on the man and beat him with their fists. 

"*No man in woman clothes!*" they chanted in their slurred, slow voices as they dealt him vicious blows and scraped and shredded him with their long, dirty nails as he screamed in torment. "*No man in woman clothes!*" The only ones who didn't participate in the mauling and killing of this poor man were me and one of the Winship's other confidants, a dour-looking white-haired man called “Chance." I remember him glancing at me, mouth slightly open and shaking his head. For some reason, this incident was enough proof for him that not all was good in this place.

And from that point on, the remaining members of the village were far more concerned with visions of duplicitous "men in women's clothes" more than they were about any threat the Winship posed to them.

Every November, the Winship, who keeps a calendar in his church in anticipation of the day, holds an "election" wherein the people insert slips of paper into a wooden box, writing the name of whom they want to be their leader into the harsh winter and through the next year. Of course, everyone always voted for the Winship, not just because they feared what he'd do if anyone voted differently but because his church provided the only suitable shelter from the cold, and no one wanted to be shut out or worse. The "election" was simply the Winship's way of stroking his own ego, of "proving" to himself that there was no being alive or dead superior to him. Why the Winship thought this way remains a mystery to me. But I've since accepted that there really are some real devils out there, hidden in the black woods of treacherous mountains or brazenly stalking about our own courthouses and halls of government here in the "civilized" world.

The people all lined up in single file in the midst of the village, a piece of paper clasped in their hands. These pieces of paper came from the church; they were pages from the ancient Bibles and hymnals and old school textbooks that had been left behind by those who once worshiped and tried to learn there. For many of the villagers, the only word they knew how to spell at all was "Winship"--something their parents taught them specifically for the task of voting for him--so they really didn't have any option to vote against him even if they wanted to. 

The Winship, with me and his other confidants flanking him, held the box and grinned greedily as each villager submitted their vote, which they were required to write in their own blood. When all the votes were in, the Winship opened the box and began pulling out the slips. There were twenty-seven villagers total at this point. And he expected no less than twenty-seven votes for him.

The Winship read each piece of paper with relish, seeing his name, as he expected, on every single one. But then, in the middle of his tallying the votes, his face fell. His snout quivered. Thin snot began to steadily leak from his nose, and for a moment, it seemed he might cry. Then, his huge yellow eyes, with their catlike pupils, bulged out of his head, and he erupted, roaring so volcanically and powerfully that the whole world seemed to shake.

Then, bedlam. He hurled the box, striking a young girl in the head with it. He started tearing the slips of paper in his little hands, muttering obscenities and curses as people gathered around the girl, whose eyes were vacant and whose mouth was moving in what might've been a silent prayer. And then the crowd met his wrath. He swiped at them, he pounced upon them, and the whole throng, most of the people, scattered and yelled in wild terror while those who could not bring themselves to stop loving the Winship watched his rampage in dismay, stupidly unaware that they weren't safe.

In the chaos, I decided to flee, as many others were. The last thing I saw of the village was the Winship catching Chance in his claws as he was frantically waving at me, imploring in a loud a voice as he could manage, "*Get out of here, Ben! Get out of here while you still can!*"

I did. But not before lunging forward in Chance's direction, thinking I could, somehow, save him. But the Winship's sharp, vampiric teeth were already sinking into his throat, and his eyes were rolling into the back of his head as he emitted a horrible, agonized gurgling sound. And then the blood really began to flow as the Winship, now all beast, began shaking its head and growling voraciously as it tore into poor Chance's flesh.

I ran. Many others ran with me, but to the best of my knowledge, they never made it out of the Catskills. By luck or divine providence or simply a good memory, I was able to identify my old hiking trail, and I made it back to society, to the "real" world, and I sit here typing this out as a kind of warning.

My fellow Americans: truth is often stranger than fiction. Always be on the lookout for the devils and beasts of this world. Sometimes, like in my case, they are hiding far off the beaten path, but more often than not, they are hiding in plain sight, ready to strike at any moment.

I pray you all resist before they do. Fight back if you must. And please, *please* don't run away like I did, leaving many people to die, crushing a piece of paper under my foot as I fled, a piece of paper with my name scrawled upon it.
