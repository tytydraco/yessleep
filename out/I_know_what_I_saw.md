I’ve been on the force for over twenty years, and I thought I had seen it all. Murders, assaults, the kind of depravity that makes you lose faith in humanity. But nothing prepared me for what I encountered that night in the old Hamilton house.

It was a quiet evening in our small town, the kind of night where you could hear the crickets chirping and the wind rustling through the trees. I was just finishing my shift when the call came in—a noise complaint from the Hamilton place. That house had been abandoned for years, ever since old man Hamilton passed away. No one had the guts to buy it, not with all the rumors about it being haunted.

I drove out there, thinking it was probably some kids messing around. The place looked just as I remembered: a dilapidated Victorian mansion, windows boarded up, ivy creeping up the sides like skeletal fingers. I parked my cruiser and grabbed my flashlight, the beam cutting through the darkness like a knife.

As I approached the front door, I noticed it was slightly ajar. I pushed it open, the hinges groaning like a wounded animal. The air inside was thick with dust and decay. The smell was overwhelming, a mix of mold and something else, something metallic. Blood.

My flashlight flickered as I stepped inside, the floorboards creaking under my weight. “Hello? This is the police!” I called out, my voice echoing through the empty halls. There was no response, just the eerie silence of an abandoned house.

I moved deeper into the house, my heart pounding in my chest. Every shadow seemed to twist and writhe as if the darkness itself was alive. I reached the living room and saw something that made my blood run cold. In the center of the room, there was a circle of candles, their flames flickering eerily. In the middle of the circle lay a body.

I approached cautiously, my flashlight trembling in my hand. The body was that of a man, his eyes wide open, staring blankly at the ceiling. His mouth was twisted into a silent scream, and his chest was covered in strange symbols, carved deep into his flesh. I recognized the man immediately—it was Joe, one of the local drunks who often caused trouble around town. But what was he doing here? And who did this to him?

I reached for my radio to call for backup when I heard a noise behind me, a soft, almost imperceptible whisper. I spun around, my flashlight catching a glimpse of something moving in the shadows. “Who’s there?” I shouted, but there was no answer, just that whispering, growing louder and more insistent.

I backed away, my pulse racing, when I felt a cold hand on my shoulder. I spun around again, but there was no one there. The whispering grew louder, surrounding me, filling my head with unintelligible words. I stumbled back, my flashlight falling to the floor and rolling away, plunging me into darkness.

In the dim light of the candles, I saw them—figures, shadowy and indistinct, moving toward me. Their eyes glowed with a malevolent light, and their mouths moved in unison, chanting something in a language I couldn’t understand. I tried to run, but my feet wouldn’t move. I was paralyzed, rooted to the spot as they closed in around me.

One of the figures stepped forward, its face inches from mine. It grinned, revealing rows of sharp, jagged teeth. “You shouldn’t have come here,” it hissed, its breath cold against my skin.

I screamed, finally finding my voice, and everything went black.

When I came to, I was lying outside the house, the sun rising in the distance. My flashlight was beside me, its beam cutting through the early morning mist. I scrambled to my feet and ran to my cruiser, my hands shaking as I fumbled for the keys. I drove straight to the station, not daring to look back.

I reported what I saw, but no one believed me. They found Joe’s body, but there was no sign of the symbols, no evidence of the figures I saw. They said it was just a noise complaint, that I must have imagined everything in the darkness.

But I know what I saw. And every night since then, I hear the whispering, growing louder, calling me back to the Hamilton house. I know they’re waiting for me, and I fear one day, I’ll have no choice but to go back.
