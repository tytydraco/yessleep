I looked at my phone. It was Em. I don’t think I had spoken to her in two years by this point, but there she was. A wave of surprise and mild anxiety rushed through me, but I answered immediately.

 

We exchanged pleasantries for a few minutes. Lamented how long it had been. Apologies all around for being busy. But I could sense there was a greater motive to this call, and Em confirmed my suspicion.

 

“So I was wondering, or, I wanted to ask something.” She said, with a bit of hesitation.

 

“Yeah? What’s up?”

 

“I want… I need you to go on a trip with me, Lila.”

 

“Oh?” I was completely taken aback.

 

“Yeah I… I’m going back home, and I really want you to come with me.”

 

“You’re going home?”

 

“Yeah, to Willow Bay… It wouldn’t be long, just a few days. I can pay for everything and… Look, it’s a long story. I’ll tell you everything. Just… say yes. I’ll come get you. We can finally catch up like we keep saying we will. I just need you with me, because no one else would understand. Please, Lie.”

 

She sounded casual, but her voice betrayed melancholy and slight desperation. I could tell she really wanted me to say yes.

 

“Are you okay Em? Did something happen?”

 

“I’m okay. I’ll tell you everything on the road, I promise. I just need to do this, I need to do it now, and I really want you with me... I know it’s sudden and you don’t have to-“

 

“I’m in. Let’s do it.” I cut her off. Sure, I could have prodded for more information. I could’ve sweated the details. But despite all the time and the lost contact, this was my best friend and she said she needed me. There was never any doubt what my answer would be.

 

I packed a small suitcase, called off work, and waited for Em to pick me up the next morning. She really wasn’t kidding about it being a sudden thing.

 

She arrived in an absolutely tiny little dark blue bug. It was nice and modern looking - way better than my piece of shit - but it was dainty as hell, and I questioned how it was gonna handle a cross country trip.

 

She got out of the car to greet me, and seeing her in person after all these years was wild. So familiar but so different. It looked like she was cosplaying a grown up. She was dressed “smart” as the hicks in our town would say, even though it wasn’t anything crazy. Really just a nice pastel cardigan and necklace, but she looked good. As beautiful as ever. I was instantly proud of her for how put together she appeared, though I had no doubts. I also clocked the same friendship bracelet on her wrist – or at least one that looked like the same one that we had as kids. I couldn’t help but smile.

 

She smiled and hugged me right away. “I’m so glad you can come.”

 

“Of course! You look so good by the way, what the fuck?”

 

“YOU look so good!” she combatted, smiling and gesturing towards me with shock on her face.

 

“Oh, no, come on. I’ll always look like a hobo.”

 

“No, you look AMAZING. I bet you get lots of…”

 

“Lots of…?”

 

“Lots of, you know…”

 

“…Pussy?”

 

Em laughed and her face went red, “I was gonna say girls.”

 

“Oh my god… You STILL don’t swear, do you?”

 

“I… Sometimes! I have before.”

 

“I dare you to say pussy, once.”

 

“I’m not gonna do that. No.”

 

“Come on, one time.”

 

“No! Now get in the f… freaking car.”

 

I put my bag in the trunk and we hit the road. I was worried if things wouldn’t feel the same after so long, but we fell into our old rhythm immediately. I didn’t even realize how much I missed this. We alternated our playlists every few hours. For as much as she liked to keep it clean, all the music she listened to was wildly aggressive. Total filth. Mostly about sucking dick or fucking. Music was always her one way of rebelling. My playlist on the other hand: Madonna, Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Cyndi Lauper… 80s pop rock and love ballads. Can’t get enough of them, I don’t know what that says about me.

 

For those first couple hours, it was everything I ever wanted. We caught up. We talked about our lives. Em was doing very well for herself; she had a nice cushy job now, lots of friends. It was so great to see her flourishing. But in a pocket of silence, I had to ask.

 

“So, Em. What are we doing? What is this trip?”

 

Em’s smile faded and she took in a big sigh, “Basically, we’re going to see my dad.”

 

“Your dad?… You know he hates me, right?”

 

“Yeah I know. He hasn’t been thrilled with me either these past few years but… I got a call from him the other day. He sounded bad… Confused… I just need to go see if he’s okay.”

 

“Oh. Okay, well I hope he’s alright but… Why did you want me to come then? I’m not complaining but I just don’t think I would be of much help. I feel like I would make things worse.”

 

“Well it’s… It’s one of the things he said.”

 

“What did he say?”

 

“He said he saw Heather.”

 

My blood ran cold. Surely these were just the delusions of a man advancing in age but… Em never did give up on Heather. If there was even the slightest chance that she really came back… That’s why she brought me.

 

“How much do you know about Black Eyed Susan?” Em asked.

 

“Uh. That serial killer? Yeah I looked him up a little bit after we got lost in that bog. He killed like 6 girls back in the 90s and early 2000s, right? Did a bunch of gnarly shit to them. Strung them up in trees and cut out their eyes or something.” I responded. I was unnerved by her question. I couldn’t understand how this could be related.

 

“Yeah… I looked him up too. It’s hard to find a lot of information about him and what he did…”

 

“Why?”

 

“I’m not sure.”

 

“No I mean why did you bring him up?”

 

“Oh. My dad… He mentioned him too.”

 

I got chills again… It was strange. Why would he mention a serial killer from 20 years ago? Was his mind really that far gone? I also wondered what Em meant when she said that her dad hadn’t been too thrilled with her either.

 

I decided to break all this seriousness in the air, “I see that friendship bracelet by the way. Is that the same damn one from decades ago?”

 

“Oh.” Em chuckled. “Yeah, I fished it out of an old box. Felt appropriate.”

 

“No shit. I wish I brought mine… I think it’s gone though.”

 

“Oh no. That sucks.”

 

“Yeah I moved around a lot. I think like 90 percent of my old stuff is gone somewhere. Also I decided I hate you, so...”

 

“Oh, sure. I get that… I didn’t expect you to keep it this long, honestly.”

 

“Yeah? Why not? That’s rude. I can keep things.”

 

Em shot me a sarcastic look, “Come on. You and Heather went through those bracelets like… tissues. That one summer I had to make like 20 of them for you guys. Meanwhile I never broke mine once… So basically I’m the better friend, is what I’m saying.”

 

“The boring friend. We couldn’t help it. We were getting into scrapes. We got our hands dirty. We handled business.”

 

“Handled business.” Em mocked. “I am NOT boring.”

 

“Well hey I don’t know how you are now. I don’t know what kind of crazy slut phase you went through when you got to the big city, but as a kid… Bit lame, gotta say.”

 

Em laughed and shook her head in dismay. “I… Hey, I did stuff! I wasn’t lame! I let you drag me into all kinds of nonsense… I don’t know anything about a slut phase, though.”

 

“No, you know exactly what I’m talking about. You were so sheltered. Your whole life. It was so sad and adorable. You can’t tell me you didn’t get to the city and just have a parade of… debauchery.”

 

“Well I’ve had sex if that’s what you’re asking, but I didn’t have a parade about it.”

 

“You should have! I would’ve been there singing songs... Keep the Christian vibe, give you some Hallelujah.”

 

Em laughed, “You are a complete nightmare.”

 

Miles passed; dozens of songs played. Civilization faded as we drove further and further out. Conversation ebbed and flowed between silliness and sincerity, the same way it always did when we were together. Em told me all the gossip about the old town. She kept in touch with her family there far more than I ever did. I didn’t even know if my family was still alive.

 

Any remnants of a city were replaced by long patches of scenic nothing broken up by small podunk towns and gas stations. Day turned to night and we stopped at a cheap motel to get some shut eye. We made do on opposite ends of one queen bed. I couldn’t complain, it was far softer than my bed. In fact, it was the best sleep I got in a long time, but by sun up we hit the road again.

 

After a few more hours in the great wide absence, I started to remember the looks of these trees and the curves of these hills. The expansive rectangular patches of distinct colours spread far and wide across the plains denoting crops and farmland of all kinds. Old busted up barns and silos peppered the area, as did lengths of makeshift wooden and wire fencing. This was home.

 

“Welcome to Willow Bay” read the sign, in familiar cursive. Memories couldn’t help but flood back. I started absent-mindedly counting all the buildings I remembered getting high behind. The town looked the same, only a little more weathered and overgrown. I couldn’t tell if it was the 8 years breaking the place down, or just my memory glossing it all up. It looked greyer too, though that could have just been the sky. Deeply overcast and moderately foggy. A subtle effect, but it made this place have the air of a ghost town. Like the town itself was a memory slowly fading.

 

We got lunch at the old diner. We had been here a thousand times, the three of us. So many good memories that even the greyest sky couldn’t dampen.

 

Finally being outside the car, standing on the ground, breathing in the old air was a trip. I forgot how different this air was over here. I don’t remember it smelling so floral, that felt new. Or maybe it was always like this, and I was just used to it.

 

We sat at the same old table as we used to. I ordered the eggs benedict hash with extra hollandaise and Em chuckled.

 

“You got that every time. Every time, even the extra hollandaise.”

 

“Yeah… Well… It’s the thing to get.”

 

“It always looked so gross to me.”

 

“That’s how you know it’s good food. The more fucked up it looks, the better it tastes, that’s just a fact. Heather would agree with me.”

 

“Yeah, right, I’ll ask her when we see her.” Em replied in a joking manner. I could see in her eyes though, that glimmer of hope.

 

We ate our food, and headed back out. It was time to see the old man. Em seemed visibly despondent as we got closer. Undoubtedly full of worry about the mental state of her father.

 

We pulled up to her old family home. Even it wasn’t immune to the creeping decay of time, as the paint chipped and cracked, and the lawn appeared overgrown. Em hesitated before knocking on the door. I took a few steps forward so that we would be side by side instead of her being out in front. That seemed to make her feel at least a little better.

 

Feet shuffled on the other side and the door opened. Her dad didn’t look anything like how I remembered. Sure, his face was the same, but his demeanor was completely foreign to me. He used to have so much presence. He wasn’t a strong man per se, but he carried himself with such stoic self-importance and clean-cut superiority. He stood straight and proper, chin held high, like a soldier. Now though, this man before me was small and frail. Hunched over. His hair was shaggy and unkempt. He hadn’t shaved in days which, for him, was a lot. He was wearing some silk pajamas which looked very cozy and upper class, but the old Ted I knew wouldn’t be seen dead in anything other than a sweater vest or priest robes.

 

“Emily! Oh my goodness, what are you doing here? I told you, you didn’t have to come.” The old man said in a weak but elated voice.

 

“Hey dad.” Em greeted with a smile and a hug.

 

“Hey Mr. Knowby.” I added, not expecting my own greeting.

 

“Come in, girls, come in.” His feet shuffled as he led us inside to the living room. He and Em exchanged small talk as he put on the tea. To give him credit, he did ask if I wanted some. We sat comfortably on the couch and waited for him to return to his old recliner.

 

As he sat down, his jovial demeanor lessened a bit, and I could tell the small talk was ending.

 

“I’m sorry if my phone call scared you. I just got a little confused is all. But it’s so good to see you. And you too, Lila.”

 

I smiled in response. I held a lot of resentment towards this man for a lot of years. All the constant backhanded comments and the judgment and the controlling behavior had made him up to be some big villain in my life, but now all I saw was an old man… excited to see his daughter again. I don’t know if I can forgive him for the way he always made me feel about myself; but in this moment, I was able to let go of a lot of the anger.

 

“How long were you planning on staying?” He asked.

 

“Oh, few days maybe.” Em responded.

 

“Oh…” Mr. Knowby sounded disappointed, but his next words confused and unsettled me. “No… you should probably leave sooner.”

 

“What? Why?”

 

The old man stammered, “I just… It would be better…”

 

“Why would it be better?”

 

The old man struggled to find the words, so he just shook his head and moved on. “I still pray for you both, you know. And for Heather.”

 

“Yeah… I know, dad.”

 

“It’s terrible… It’s just terrible what happened. I thought he wasn’t… I thought God would…” He trailed off, but Em caught the same thing I did.

 

“He?” She questioned.

 

“He. I. I don’t know.” The old man was clearly rattled by his slip up.

 

“You’re talking about Black Eyed Susan?”

 

“No I just… I don’t want to…”

 

“Do you know something? About what happened to Heather?” Em prodded, with increasing authority in her voice.

 

“Emily…” Her dad uttered, attempting to scold but he was clearly on the back foot. I had never seen him shaken like this before. It scared me to death.

 

“Please, dad. If you know something. Or if you really did see her like you said you did… You have to tell us. You HAVE to.”

 

“It was wrong… To call you. To say those things. You shouldn’t have come. I’m sorry. I can’t. I shouldn’t.”

 

“So why did you call me? What happened?” Em now raised her voice, with an undercurrent of frustration.

 

“I was just… Scared.”

 

“Scared of what?” Em yelled.

 

The old man fell silent and averted his gaze, as did Em. She sat back and sank into the couch, collecting herself. I could see deep and painful emotion bubbling beneath her blank expression, but I also saw calculation. She was meticulously putting together the words she wanted to say next.

 

“If you think you’re protecting me, you’re not. If you think I’m still a naïve little girl, I’m not. I’m not a child. My best friend has been missing for nine years, dad. Whatever you tell me, it isn’t going to be any worse than what my mind has already thought of.”

 

The old man leaned forward, resting his elbows on his legs before he solemnly uttered, “Yes it is.”

 

A chill ran down my spine. It felt like the air in the room got sucked out. Em was visibly shaken by his response.

 

The old man let out a sigh, “You really want to hear this?”

 

“Yes… Please.” Em responded, meekly.

 

“Okay Emily… Okay… You do deserve to know. I do want you to know. Just tell me if you want me to stop or if you need a minute.”

 

“I want to know everything.”

 

He nodded and sat back in his chair in deep contemplation before finally speaking. “I took an oath to never repeat these things. It was my duty. Under no circumstance could I breathe a word of what anyone confessed to me… And I never did. I didn’t think that I would need to, either, but…”

 

He paused, took a long sip of his drink, and collected himself. Em and I waited patiently for him to continue.

 

“2003… or 4, maybe. You’re around six at this time. I’m running confession. This man comes into the booth. He says ‘bless me father for I have sinned’ - the whole thing… Then he sits there quiet for about three minutes. Sometimes this happens, I give him the time to gather his wits. Then he says ‘I am the one they call Black Eyed Susan.’” Mr. Knowby cleared his throat and fidgeted with his fingers. He squirmed in his seat.

 

I’ve never seen a man so uncomfortable. Not only was he reliving a traumatic moment, he was betraying a lifelong oath at the same time. The man I knew was a steel trap. Stubborn and sturdy as an old oak. No amount of words or passionate pleas would move him. What changed?

 

“The papers said there were 6 murders… But he told me… There were so many more. Dozens. He told me what he did to them and I… I just… I thought he was lying at first. Sometimes you get pranksters. But the more he went on… I knew he was the guy. He said he came here because he needed to be cleansed. He needed to be pure before the next step. That’s a word he kept using – “pure.” All the girls he took had to be “pure” in his eyes. That’s why they were…” As that last sentence struggled to leave his mouth, his lip quivered and his voice broke. He shook his head and set his jaw. My skin crawled.

 

“It wasn’t about murder… It wasn’t about pleasure either, he was obsessed… Obsessed with this idea that he could find life’s deepest secrets. Only through purity. Only through being one with the earth and with nature. He said plants, trees, and flowers can sense the ‘cosmic rhythm of the universe’ as he called it. That they move with the sun and the constellations. He saw them as the purest essence of life, and so they must hold the secret to it. He wanted to see what they see. Feel what they feel. Attune himself to that ‘cosmic rhythm’. Learn, and ascend. It all sounded insane but if you could hear his voice when he said it… He believed every word.”

 

He was right, it did sound insane. Em had a sick look on her face, but she was listening intently. I was beginning to regret hearing about this.

 

The old man continued, “He used those girls to do it. His ‘little flowers’, he called them.”

 

Another shiver went up my spine. I remembered those words.

 

“He said it had to be girls because… something about ‘motherhood’ and ‘mother nature’. They could create life, so they had the capacity to understand life… So he would take them and try and force them to somehow bond with the plants. To ‘hybridize’; to become ‘one’ with them. He had many methods. Psychological, surgical… Physically grafting plant life onto them, into them. When they would die, he would take the parts he needed and discard the rest into the earth.” I almost wretched. Mr. Knowby steeled his jaw once again.

 

“Of course, it didn’t work - nothing would happen. But then… He looked into one of his victims’ eyes as they were about to die and he said he saw it. Whatever it was he was looking for. Life, the universe, eternity. He said it was right there in her eyes. He said it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. So he took them. Then he started taking all of their eyes. He’d preserve them and look at them, and he would see. He would learn.” Mr. Knowby began to sound less like a man merely relaying the ramblings of an unstable man, and more like an unstable man himself. There was a fanatical tone underlying in the cadence of his words, slowly creeping to the surface the more he spoke. I don’t think he was aware of it. This felt like a new man to the one we had spoken to even five minutes ago.

 

“Then his experiments started to work. He said it all began making sense to him. He made serums. Drug cocktails. Stabilizers. He took their brain tissue, and tried to wire it into the plant roots. He fed them blood, used skin and muscle as soil. He put veins and tendons into the vines, and hearts to pump the blood through. Everything he could use. Everything he could graft and bind and connect to make them one. Any way to hybridize, whether it worked or not. He said he wanted to create new forms of life, extend it, preserve it, clone it, evolve it-”

 

“Stop!” Em shouted. “Stop! Stop it! This is nonsense! This isn’t real! You don’t believe this, do you? And what does this have to do with Heather? Black Eyed Susan is dead!”

 

“I thought it was nonsense too! Of course I didn’t believe he was doing these things… But I believed that he believed he was… I thought about telling someone right after the confession, but the next day I see on the news he turned himself in. Then he died. So it was over. Even when Heather went missing, I didn’t think anything of it. He was gone… But the thing is, people kept going missing after her. In other towns and other counties. It didn’t stop. He told me it wouldn’t stop, but I had no reason to believe him once he got caught. Certainly not once he died. But he told me he had so much more work to do. He told me he found the secret. He said he would make us all see. And… Emily… I see.”

 

“Dad…”

 

“Only a little bit. I know there’s so much more. But I can see it now. It’s in the air. It’s in the trees. I’ve seen things that I don’t think are real. But maybe they’re more real than any of us. And it’s growing. It’s here. I saw Heather. I saw her walking outside in the night, in the fog. I saw-”

 

Em stood up “Okay. Okay. I have to go. We have to go. I’m sorry dad. I’ll come back. I’ll be back tomorrow. We’ll talk, I promise. I just… I have to-“ She briskly walked out of the room and out the front door. I followed closely behind.

 

As we left I heard him muttering “No! Go home tonight! Go home tonight, Emily!”

 

She sat in the driver’s seat of the bug, hands clasped on the steering wheel, nearly hyperventilating. I sat next to her.

 

“I can’t look at him like that. I don’t want to see him like that. He doesn’t even look like my dad anymore. He’s delusional. It’s all insane. It doesn’t even make sense because he said the girls had to be pure or whatever but Heather did drugs and had sex when she was with Dom. That doesn’t fit with their ‘purity’. But he didn’t know that. He’s making it up. He wants to scare me so I’ll come back and change my ways. So he can turn me back into who I was. It’s fake. Why else would he make up such horrible things? I don’t understand.” Em rambled on justification after justification. Her mind desperate to make sense of it all, but her body in the midst of a panic attack.

 

“Breathe, Em. Please, just breathe. It’s okay. He’s old, and he’s confused sometimes. He has all this old trauma and it’s manifesting in ways he doesn’t understand. It sucks, I know, but it’s gonna be okay. He’ll be okay. We’ll get him the help he needs.” I tried desperately to reassure her, even though I was scared and disturbed beyond comprehension.

 

Em calmed her breathing as much as she could. “I want to go home. I don’t want to be here anymore.”

 

“I know… But I know you, Em. You’re going to regret it if that’s how you leave things. You’ll regret it forever… Let’s go to the village motel. Have one nice, chill night. We’ll order Chinese from Summit – they’re still there, I saw. And then in the morning, we’ll come back over. We won’t talk about… any of it. Nothing that’ll set him off. We’ll just have a lunch or whatever. Keep it light. Talk about his old harmonicas and shit. Say goodbye properly, and then we’ll go.”

 

Em sat back for a minute and then finally answered. “Okay.”

 

There are two moments in my life that I wish I could change more than anything in the world. The first moment I would change was me not being there for Heather before she disappeared… The second moment I would change was the moment I convinced Em to stay in Willow Bay for another night.
