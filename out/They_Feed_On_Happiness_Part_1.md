I don’t have much time to explain, I have to get writing immediately if I want my story to be heard. I have no idea what’s going on back at the surface, maybe everyone in town is dead, hell, maybe even everyone in the world is. All I know is that I’m stuck down here and I doubt I’ll see the light of day again. What little supplies I have left should be enough to last me a few days. I’ll write everything down in order.



I saw nothing, I felt nothing, but I could hear them screaming… the kids at the schoolyard placed conveniently a few hundred feet from my apartment, that is. This was my first day off in two weeks and I couldn’t even get so much as a *peaceful* morning. As my eyelids unwillingly separated, I sat up and grabbed my phone as my feet hit the cold flooring beneath my bed. “9:42 AM”, I’d been sleeping for nearly 10 hours and still didn’t feel rested. Working in a convenience store during the day and at a bar during the nights *does* put a strain on you I suppose. I’m not one to complain though. “Millions of kids around the world are starving”, as my father always said whenever I’d show the slightest bit of negative emotions. 



Anyway, the reason as to why I had the day off was because it was my birthday. Realizing I was now exactly two decades old wasn’t as fun as I’d anticipated. Ever since I was about 14, I hadn’t really celebrated any of my birthdays, but this time it was my parents’ idea. They probably felt bad for kicking me out as soon as I turned 18, or that’s what I *wanted* to think, at least. I rubbed my eyes and let out a sigh, knowing the history between me and my family, I was in for a long day.



Once I’d gotten up and made myself look as presentable as possible, I sat down in front of the TV. I turned it on and checked what they had to say on the news, unsurprisingly, it was about war and catastrophes, maybe another pandemic here and there. Before I could mutter a comment about the world going to shit, a familiar sound echoed out into my empty living room from my pocket.



I pulled my phone out of my pocket to see a text message from my mother. 



“Are you ready? Don’t forget! It’s your birthday and you promised to come visit us today! We’re all waiting here. Love, Mom.” - Followed by a seemingly random line of smileys and thumbs up.



I lived about an hour or so away from my hometown where my parents lived, so I didn’t wanna leave too early and make it awkward by barging in there before they even had a chance to get ready. I didn’t really feel appreciated by my parents growing up, I always felt like my little sister was the favorite child. My dad is a little more honest about it since we pretty much never talk unless my mom forces us to, which doesn’t happen often either. *She,* on the other hand, still acts like nothing ever happened. I texted her back telling her I’d be leaving at around 11 AM.



I still had two hours left to spend, so I decided to take a walk around town and get some fresh air. As I walked out of my apartment building, I took a deep breath, that had always been my favorite part of winter, the cold air. As soon as I started walking, I almost slipped on a frozen puddle of water hidden under a thin blanket of snow. So far, everything was going just as expected with my luck. I kept it pushing and walked around the small town I now called home for an hour or so. 



As I trudged along the snow-covered sidewalks downtown, I thought about how eerily empty it was, there wasn’t a *single* person out there. It *was* a particularly cold day, but still, there’d always be at least a *few* people out and about. I didn’t have the time nor energy to think about that though, today would be the first day I faced my parents since the day I turned 18. What would they ask? And what would I answer? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous. I kept walking, my mind completely lost in thought, and before I knew it, I was back home again. 



I packed all the things I’d need in case of an emergency since I was planning on going back home to my apartment the same day. After packing and warming up for a bit, I checked my phone for any notifications, as expected, there were no “happy birthday” texts from any of my childhood friends. I’m usually not the type of person to feel bad for myself, I knew I was lonely and I’d realized that a long time ago. I guess birthdays make the feeling of isolation more saturated, more painful. By this point, it was already around 11 AM, it was time to go.



“I might as well get going.” - I said out loud to myself. I once again put my jacket and boots on and made my way outside. I unlocked my old Corolla, started the engine and pulled out my window scraper. Every surface visible was covered in snow, and those that weren’t were covered in frost instead. Once I was done scraping, the engine had warmed up a little so I was good to go. I pulled out of the parking lot and began my journey home.



As I drove down the highway, tapping my fingers on the steering wheel and that same clump of anxiety in the pit of my stomach still weighing me down, I thought once again about what my parents would say. Why was I so nervous? Had it really been that long? I hadn’t thought about it for a while, I figured my parents weren’t interested in ever seeing me again, but here I was, on my way home. I was ill-prepared and anxiety-ridden, but there was no going back.



\*\*\*



“Welcome!” - My mother greeted me with an awkward hug as I entered my childhood home.



“How’s it going bud? You doin’ good at work?” - My father asked with one eyebrow raised and a forced smile on his lips.



“Oh don’t start interrogating him about work now! It’s his birthday.” - My mother argued before I could give an answer.



Barely a minute in, and I knew nothing had changed about them. They still acted like nothing had happened, like none of the daggers disguised as words they had thrown at me ever existed.



And as for my little sister, all she had to offer was a measly: “Hey”. I don’t blame her to be honest. It’d been two years since we last saw each other and the 7 year age gap between us coupled with the completely opposite personal interests had always made it hard for us to bond. I didn’t hold a grudge against my sister though, none of what happened between me and our parents was her fault.



After greeting each other and making all the usual small talk, I sat down on the couch where I always used to sit to watch a movie.



“Ooh, looks like you took Bowser’s spot there bud.”



“What? Bowser?”



“Our new dog? Your mother didn’t tell you about that?”



“Uh no… she didn’t.”



“Well, he- oh! There he is!”



My father knelt down to pet the old German shepherd. It had gray hairs near its snout and chest. It greeted my father with a wagging tail before slowly coming over to me. I moved over as he sniffed my knees and hands. After inspecting me thoroughly, the old dog jumped up on the couch and laid down beside me. I did feel a little bit betrayed, I feel like getting a dog would be a pretty big deal, at least something you’d want to tell your son about; especially since we’d never had any pets. But, I wasn’t surprised either.



“Alright, you two just sit tight, I’m heading out to the store to get some smokes.” - My dad said as he made his way to the foyer.



A few minutes went by before my mother came over to sit down on the couch. I asked her why she’d never told me about the dog. Basically all she had to say was that it simply never crossed her mind since I “didn’t like dogs”... I distinctly remember begging my parents to get a dog all throughout my early childhood.



Upon hearing her answer, I asked myself internally why I was even surprised, I barely had any contact with them at all anymore, not even with my mother. I felt bad for thinking so selfishly, so I shrugged it off and focused on making the most out of this day.



\*\*\*



It was around 7PM now, we hadn’t done much during the day other than watch movies and catch up, and my little sister hadn’t come downstairs even once. But soon, it was time for dinner. That’s probably what I’d missed the most since moving out, the food. I felt horrible for even thinking it, but at least it was a compliment to my mother, even if it was a backhanded one. My mother had always been an amazing cook, she could cook anything and had several notebooks filled with recipes she came up with on her own. I remember her telling me as a kid about how she used to want to become a chef before she met my father.



It was almost time for dinner now. As I helped my father set the table, my mother went upstairs to call my sister down for dinner. A few minutes later, my sister descended the stairs, following behind my mother as she yawned and rubbed her eyes.



“You didn’t go to school today?” - I tried to strike up a conversation with my sister.



“Nah, some dudes in suits came by the school yesterday, gathered us all up in the auditorium and told us school was out for the rest of the week. Even the teachers seemed confused but I’m not complaining.”



“Oh, alright… Don’t you think that’s weird?”



“I mean yeah, but I can’t stand that place anyway…”



“Oh… Okay.” - Was all I could say. 



Judging by the tone of her voice, I could tell there was more to it than simply disliking school. She held a special kind of hatred towards school; just like I had done. I was bullied all throughout middle school, I’d forgotten most of it but looking at my sister, some of the memories came back. Despite the fact that me and my sister looked completely different, her being a copy of my father and me being a copy of my mother, she still reminded me of my younger self. Even though I knew she was going through something, there were no words of affirmation or consolidation I could give, so I kept quiet. My mind wandered off as I thought about my middle school experiences.



Jacob was his name, the worst one. He couldn’t go a day without shoving me to the ground or embarrassing me in front of everyone. I wondered where he was today, was he in the same boat as me? Probably not, he was always spoiled, to his parents, Jacob was an angel who couldn’t possibly do wrong. 



As the sensory deprivation tank that was my mind loosened its grip on me, I heard the clanging of pots and pans coming from the kitchen. My mother let out a sigh of relief as she announced that dinner was ready. I helped her bring over the numerous plates of food and side dishes to the table.



\*\*\*



“Alright, it’s chow time.” - My father said as he rubbed his hands together and clapped as if he was straight out of a sitcom.



“Dad…” - My sister said with one eyebrow raised, letting the silence speak for itself.



“Oh come on!” - He replied as he threw his hands up.



My mother giggled as she looked at my father, my sister doing the same. Even though I didn’t feel all that included, my lips couldn’t help but curl into a weak smile. Despite everything that had happened, I still loved my family.



Just as we were about to dig in however, I heard a faint sound coming from above. It was like the sound of an old, creaky door mixed with the grunting of a boar.



“Did you guys hear that?”



“Hear what?” - My father responded.



“That weird growling noise from upstairs, is there another dog you haven’t told me about?” - I asked jokingly.



“Might just be the house settling.” - My father said as he shrugged.



“Sure, after living here for 23 years, definitely the house settling.” - My mother laughed.



And at that, I shrugged it off too, even though every single instinctual alarm in me was blaring. I couldn’t help but feel that something horrible was about to happen. I had lost my appetite and had begun sweating, I just sat there awkwardly as adrenaline began pumping in my veins while the others enjoyed their food. Was I having some sort of schizo-episode? Just as the thought popped up in my head, my fear was confirmed.



A loud crash erupted from above, before we could even react, the room filled with dust from the collapsed ceiling above us. From the newly created hole in the ceiling, about a foot or so in diameter, a long, sickly gray arm extended down towards my sister; too quickly to react to. The arm was covered in oozing, black blisters from which an acidic black liquid was squirting out. The room was filled with an intensely foul odor, I couldn’t help but to cover my nose with my shirt and close my eyes. It felt like my eyes would melt if I opened them even a little. My skin was burning, so many thoughts were racing through my head, I couldn’t make any sense of what was going on.



As I heard my sister cry out in pain, I snapped out of it and opened my eyes. My father stood beside my sister who was still sitting in the chair, he had grabbed a hold of the disgusting, malformed, 10 feet long arm. He looked over to me with frantic, panicked eyes and screamed at me to help, and as soon as he did, I ran as fast as I could to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could find. I grabbed it in a panic and ran back to the dining room. My father’s back was towards me, I could see him struggling against this impossible monster. I looked down at the butcher knife in my hand, realizing that I had no idea how I would hurt that thing with just a knife.



“Johnathan! Hurry!”



I ran over and began hacking at the monstrous arm. Just after the first swing, all other sounds in the room instantly cut out. I could see Bowser barking furiously in the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t hear him, all I heard was my own heartbeat. As the blade made a gash in its sickly, gray skin, the black acidic puss splashed all over me, instantly melting through my clothes. I ignored the pain and kept swinging my knife at it, all the while both my sister and father were screaming out in pain as their skin sizzled. After what could be 10 seconds, or 10 minutes for all I know, the arm was nearly severed just above the wrist. A few black and gray strands of seemingly rotted flesh was all that was holding it together, yet the arm still had the strength to hold my sister's arm with an iron grip.



I put all the might I had left into a single, last swing. As the arm was severed, a bone-chilling screech echoed all throughout the house, seemingly coming from everywhere at once. The long, bony fingers released their grip on my sister’s arm and fell down onto the floor in a wet slap. I immediately collapsed, I was dizzy and out of breath, I felt like my consciousness would be ripped from me at any second.



Just as I was about to black out, I felt a gentle pair of hands wrap around my shoulders, it was my mother. She helped me up to my feet and told me to breathe. Little by little, my vision cleared and my heart slowed down. I looked over to my sister and father, several layers of skin had melted away from my sister’s left forearm; and the same for my father’s palms.



What was this thing? Why did this happen to us? Am I cursed? Did this happen because of me? I had too many questions and I feared no one in the world could have the answers to them. As I stood looking at my injured father and sister, I suddenly felt a stabbing pain in my stomach. Without having time to check what it was, everything went black and I crashed down onto the floor, hitting my head against the table on my way down.



“Jonathan.”



“Jonathan, wake up!” 



I opened my eyes to see my mother sitting beside me on the floor. I was bleeding from my stomach, how heavily so, I couldn’t tell you. My mother may have been a good cook, but she was never one for patching wounds or handling stressful situations. But the bandage haphazardly wrapped around my abdomen seemed to be doing its job for the time being. She thanked God after seeing I was responsive. I tried to muster up the strength to ask if my father and sister were okay, but I couldn’t utter a single word. My mouth just sat agape as if waiting for my tongue to form the words. My strength was completely sapped. All I knew was that I was alive.
