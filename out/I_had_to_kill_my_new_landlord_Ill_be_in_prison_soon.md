This was last night, I tried to clean up the mess. I’m not sure I’ll be able to hide it and get away, I’m not sure I even wanna try tbh. 

I had officially moved in yesterday, I rented a room in a house, a nice 80 year old man’s. I saw the ad online, and called. We talked and he said he had no relatives, and was retired. We agreed on 400$ for rent, how rents really SHOULD be. He also said I could move in immediately.


When I first got to the house it all seemed fine, few old style figurines and paintings, older furniture. The house had that “wrapped up” feeling a lot of older people’s homes have. It was comforting in a way. The room I got was a nice size, and already furnished with a bed and some nightstands. There were two bathrooms, and I’d get my own, right across the hall. 


I had brought dinner to share with him from a restaurant. After having dinner and getting to know each other a bit more, he said he was ready to go watch tv in his room until he passed out. There was no tv in my room, he said I was welcome to watch the one in the living room. But I was going to be on my phone anyways.


A few hours went by and I was bored, I couldn’t really sleep. I was pretty comfortable, but had that “new place mania”. Everything was so new, I had gotten a good deal, I’d be closer to work now. I couldn’t wait to get to know this new neighborhood and the people around.

I was jerked out of my deep anticipation by the old man yelling. I sat awake, trying to make sure I heard right. “Ahhh!” One more yell. I instinctively ran over to his room. “Is everything alright?” He didn’t respond. I decided to see if the door would open but it was locked. I waited for a few minutes.. “Ahh!” “HELP!” I panicked and busted the door down.


I ran in his room, the only light, silently dancing around the room, was from the tv. I tried to switch on the light but I didn’t find a switch. I looked closer and saw the old man, laying silently in his bed. “Are you okay?” No response. There was a fan above his bed, I went to get closer to pull the switches.



When I got to the foot of his bed, he started giggling, and crying simultaneously. His voice sounded contorted. I didn’t bother to ask anything, something felt very wrong. I took some steps back, got out of his room, and shut the door how I could. I went back to my room and locked the door. I sat on the bed trying to process. It was around 3am when this happened. 


Next thing I know there’s some extremely loud banging on my bedroom door. Before I can react the old man bursts through the door. Before I can ask what’s going on, he launches at me. He jumped on me, and gripped my throat with bony fingers. He was a lot stronger than I’d ever expect. I tried to pry his hands off me, but I couldn’t. 


When I looked into his eyes, I honestly saw evil inside his pupil, I can’t quite explain it. It was like a feeling that gripped me, and pulled me into a dark pool of dread and helplessness. The more I stared into his eyes, the more I would feel it. I had to look away. He had a crazed smile, but somehow his face expressed hatred and rage. A darkness accentuated by the old features.


I wrestled him off me as I could, and ran out the door, I reached the living room and looked back. Only to see the old man running at me on all fours… on the ceiling. I turned and ran towards the door, but as I was reaching the door, I felt something pull my hair extremely hard, it was the old man, gripping my hair from where he squatted on the ceiling. 


I fell back and he dropped on top of me, he slapped me and yelled at me, speaking in tongues. He grabbed me by my shirt and dragged me to the kitchen, where he ripped open a drawer and pulled out a huge knife. He lifted me up in the air with one arm, holding the knife under my neck with the other, when suddenly he dropped me and the knife.


I laid on the floor in shock, the old man seemed to have passed out. “I’m so sorry, I’ve always been able to stop it, I can’t tonight.” The old man said in his regular voice while laying still. I was too stunned to speak. 


The old man started getting up, this time singing in some strange ancient language, in the voice of a woman. He went for the knife, but my instincts kicked in, and I kicked him. He fell back dramatically. Whimpering in what sounded like the old man’s regular voice. I grabbed the knife and stood up. 


“Stop, please, I might stab you” Was all I managed to say. He started laughing in the demonic voice again. He jerked up and started slowly walking towards me. I kept getting caught by *those eyes*.


He ran towards me as I pointed the knife out, it rammed right into his chest. He fell to his knees, eyes wide with shock. He seemed back to normal again. “ I’m so sorry” was all I could say, I was really in shock. 

 
It seemed as if he died, but he got up again. He was back into demonic mode, laughing maniacally as he slid the knife out of his chest. He licked it, and tossed it at me. Then he lunged at me. He was trying to strangle me again. I gripped the knife but I couldn’t stab him. As I was losing my breath, I looked into his eyes. The hatred and dread blinded me. I stabbed him as he laughed louder and louder, until I fainted. 


When I came to the old man was just a badly mangled body, the puddle of blood covered the whole kitchen. I was in a haze. So in disbelief I thought I was dreaming. My only instinct was to try to clean.


I covered up the body on the couch with a blanket, mopped up a third of the blood, and had a throw up break. Now I sit here mentally preparing to call the police, I know they’ll think I’m crazy, but idk what else to do. Or maybe I’ll try harder to cover it up and run away somewhere. There’s no records of me living here, and the neighbors haven’t seen me. Idk, I have to figure shit out now. I drank and passed out all day while I was trying to clean.
