I have enjoyed seeing people reading this. It's insane how much history is lost just to be found in new and terrifying ways. I hope this story touches you the way it has me and I hope more of the history surrounding this beautiful bay can be told one day.

Two days passed and I had cleared a great deal of the drive. I grew to love this place and audibly through around the idea of just…staying.

“You have a job, but you could easily do that job anywhere,” I said aloud to myself. Skip was on his leash attached to a running line I had strung across the drive while I worked. He was leaping back and forth desperate to get free and catch an errant butterfly. “You have no friends in Knoxville, they are all at Vandy… you aren’t happy there.”

I rolled my eyes. “What the fuck am I doing talking to myself. Am I crazy, Skip?” I asked the dog, but I didn’t hear him plopping back and forth anymore.

“Skip?” I called, looking over to  his running line. The leash hung limp and still in the center of the drive. The blue collar with the bone shaped name tag I had made rested in the dirt. He was gone.

“Skip!!” I cried and darted back and forth across the drive, looking into the trees and brush to find him. His little footprints stopped on his running line path and didn’t venture past the treeline. He was picked up by…something?

I strained my ears, listening for a whimper or bark. 

Finally…I heard it.

Toward the house, a little yap was carried on the wind from the sea. 

I ran toward the house and past the awning housing the Bella Elena and stopped abruptly, looking around the shoreline for Skip. He was so small I was afraid I would not see him before the sea swept him out. 

A tiny bark drew me to the left and I saw, on a white cap, my sweet little Skip, being swept toward the unforgiving ocean.

I ran, full sprint, toward the water, disregarding its cold bite. I leapt forward and swam toward the bobbing form of the tiny puppy I had grown to depend on.

I grasped, I missed.

I grasped again, I missed.

I dug my feet into the sand and propelled forward and blindly grasped a third time.

My hand gripped his leg and I pulled forward. If I hurt him, I would deal with it later. I just needed him back in my arms. 

I pulled him close to me and swam quickly back to the shore, allowing the incoming waves to push me forward. Once I dragged us up onto the shore I hugged Skip close to my chest, feeling his heart racing and his body shivering in fear and cold. 

“Skip, baby, I’m so sorry, what the fuck,” I mumbled into this wet fur. 

I felt them again…the eyes on me. 

I looked up and saw, closer than ever, a woman standing on the water. Shrouded in shadow, wind blowing her hair.

“What the fuck is wrong with you!?” I screamed at it. I didn’t expect a response but I felt a little better screaming at something. “What do you WANT!?” 

She fell, like a trap door had opened beneath her, into the sea and I screamed in frustration. Standing up shakily, I wrapped Skip in my wet shirt and ran with him into the house. I started a fire in the fireplace and quickly changed my clothes. I found a towel and wrapped my sweet boy up in it, sitting as close to the fire as I could without burning myself. He finally settled down, his shivering body stilling after what felt like a couple of hours. I had hummed to him like a baby (wow, I’m a dog mom now, I guess) and made sure he ate and drank. Another few moments fighting those waves and he would have drowned. I didn’t think he had inhaled or swallowed any sea water, but I knew I was gonna be up all night watching him. 

I felt a rush of anger toward…whatever this thing was that was following me. I knew it was her. Skip’s collar was tight enough not to slip and there was no way the buckle failed. He couldn’t have made it that far in that short amount of time without someone taking him out there.

“What did you do, Juliette?” I whispered into the darkness. I didn’t expect an answer. I knew it was just some delusional questions sparked by a story I was reading…but it felt so real. 

Once Skip was asleep, I bundled up his towel and put him back down on it a little further back from the fire. He was still a little cold but I was sweating and needed to move.

I walked back over to the couch and picked up Charleston Blackwood’s journal again. The power had been restored by 9 am and I flicked the lamp back on, settling in the arm of the couch to continue to unravel the Blackwood mystery.

“September 8, 1833

Juliette lost the baby. It has been difficult for her, but my Solomon has been an angel to his mother in this time. Juliette has never handled loss well. Her dear mother and father both fell to cholera only 3 years ago and she has not yet recovered from the grief of it when this loss had fallen on us. This was the third.

The baby was fully formed. The doctor said it should have lived, but simply did not. Until the moment the baby was born the doctor could hear the baby moving inside her.

I will never blame God for this, the third child to die since coming to this place, but I would wish to ask what we had done to create a hostile environment for it to grow. I would also never blame my sweet Juliette. She has prayed and fasted for another child for so long. She always said she did not wish for Solomon to walk this world alone. Were we to perish, who would he have? No sibling to mourn with. No family to speak of. All gone. It is a fate I would not wish upon anyone.”

Tears dripped onto the ink, smudging it slightly. I set the book aside and buried my head in my hands. I knew the pain he felt for his child. I am living that pain. Mourning alone, walking the world alone…no family to speak of….

After a  moment of deep breathing and sniffles, I sat back up and took the book back in my hands. I wiped away the two tear drops on the page carefully and continued.

“I held her close after the doctor left. I begged her to never surrender to the sadness. If God wills it, it will be, I told her. We are living on His time. I knew she was angry and scared and when she cursed God, I knew she did not mean it. I knew she would attend confessional when she was physically able and repent of her sins condemning her God. In that moment, I prayed over her and held her close. It was all I could do.”

There was no signature on this entry. The last few lines were shaky and unusually untidy. He was mourning as he wrote. 

I felt an odd sense of connection to Charleston and Juliette in that moment. My mom and dad told me they tried for so very long to have me and after I was born, they wanted to give me a sibling. They tried until they biologically couldn’t anymore. They wanted to adopt, but we didn’t have the money. It just…wasn’t in the cards for me to have a sibling, I supposed. I sympathized with young Solomon Blackwood- the lonely sibling like me. I knew he would eventually have Violet, however, that would not last. 

“November 22, 1833

I arranged a ship to bring Juliette’s brother and sister to the Bay port off Buxton. I did not tell her about the voyage and when they arrived, I could never describe the beauty of the smile on her face. I learned very little French but I heard her tell them she loved them and this was her happiest day in so long. My heart ached for her. She had not been well since we lost the baby. She buried him in the sand beside the lighthouse. I insisted we use the paddock beyond the trees and move the horses to build a family plot, but she did not want her baby in the woods. She wanted him near. Since the loss, she and Solomon abandoned the house and took up residence in the keeper’s quarters with me. While I was happiest in her arms at night, I feared for her mind. She did not rest easily. She would often depend on malt whisky or wine from the merchants who sailed through to lull her to sleep. I told her it was not going to help her grieve but she would not hear of it. How I wish I could drive the demons from my wife’s soul.

\-Charleston Blackwood”

Skreek….skreek…skreek….

The sound of something scratching against glass caused me to jump and look around. The curtains were drawn and I couldn’t see out of them but it sounded close

Skreeeeeeeeek…skeeeek…skreeeeek….

Just next to me. I reached up to part the curtains just a milimeter… just enough to see out…

Nothing.

Skreeeeeeek

Behind the sink in the kitchenette… The tiny window above the sink.

Skreeeeeeek

The window behind the dining room table.

“Please…just go away,” I begged softly. 

Tap Tap Tap Tap Tap

The sound was increasing in volume, hard to pinpoint. Skip was awake by now, his ears pinned back and his tail straight, eyes darting back and forth. I’m sure he thought he would be able to fight off whatever was there valiantly, but I scooped him up and held him close.

“You’re not real!” I screamed at the dark. The tapping stopped, leaving silence behind. 

Right behind me, a sigh brushed my neck.

I almost dropped Skip in my haste to turn around, but nothing-no one was there. I ran out of the house and got into my truck, closing and locking the door. I was not certain whatever was chasing me wouldn’t come out here and get me, but I felt better being in something that could move if need be. 

I started to wish I had grabbed the journal. After a few moments I sighed and placed Skip in the passenger seat.

“Stay right here, boy,” I told him. “And if a demon lady tries to grab you, bite her fingers off. Ok?”

He just tilted his head at me.

I got out, locked the door and moved swiftly toward the house. I saw the journal on the couch where I left it, but it was not on the page I left it on. It was almost at the end. 

“January 12, 1835

Juliette missed her monthly. Her doctor has confirmed she is once again with child. I want to be elated and praise God for the miracle of another sweet baby, however I fear this one will be taken like the rest. Juliette does not share my fears. She says she will see the healthy birth of this child or die in the effort. Solomon does not know and will not until Juliette is unable to hide the pregnancy. I have seen my poor boy grieving more loss than he should in his 7 years and until my faith is more stable in the baby’s health, I will protect him as much as I can. 

The merchant ship that passed through port yesterday turned out to be a smuggler ring. We recovered 16 women and children from the galley who were to be sold into slavery. The captain escaped but the crew were hanged on the seaside. It is my hope he is apprehended soon. He met my eyes and knows my face.

Evil lived in those eyes. There was no man beneath the skin of that captain. 

The authorities assure me my family and I are safe, but I will likely rest in intervals shorter than usual from now on. 

\-Charleston Blackwood”

The book flipped pages on its own, making me jump. The date was 7 months later.

“July 8, 1835

My dear Juliette has given birth to a beautiful baby girl. Our sweet Violet. Perfect in every way from her nose to her toes. I find myself neglecting my duties sometimes just staring at her bright eyes. She is so full of life and love. Solomon is an exemplary brother to her. He has even learned to clean her diapers and how to pin them. I know that he will always protect her even after we are gone. 

The merchant smuggler was caught just two days ago. He had been living among the wood along Avon and was caught stealing bread from the bakery. I attended his hanging. He never took his eyes off me…even in death his eyes were on me. As the light left the man’s eyes, I saw a familiar spirit behind them…I knew this spirit from my dreams. I had known something was watching me in the lighthouse…and now it was watching through the closing windows of the merchant’s eyes. 

I have asked Juliette In the past about demons and evil spirits. I always felt, in that light house, that something had attached itself to the Blackwood family. The sins of my grandfather have followed me for years and surely will continue to do so until I or my Solomon can create a new reputation in the maritime field. Do I believe some dark devil is cursing my family? Killing my children in my wife’s womb? I don’t know. I didn’t believe such things to be true until I looked into that man’s eyes. 

I will continue to pray for my family’s spiritual health and prosperity. It is all I can do as a man and a father. 

\-Charleston Blackwood”

I felt a burning sensation across my back, bringing me to my knees. The book flew off the couch onto the floor in front of me. 

“October 28, 1835

I was awakened just now by a feeling of a weight on my chest. I looked around and found that Juliette, Solomon and Violet had not been disturbed but I felt as if whatever had awakened me was still in the room, watching us like a predator. I spoke to whatever it was and told it it was not welcome in this place in the name of God. The bed shook.

What is happening to my family?”

No signature again. I attempted to stand, but as I stood, I was met with a disturbing site.

Only inches from my face…was a woman.

She was drenched, grey and wide-eyed. She looked livid.

“J…Juliette,” I stuttered. I knew it was her. I had seen that beautiful smile in the picture, proudly holding her husband’s arm. Her face was changed in death. Older, more worn…as if she lived a much longer life than she actually did.

She stared down at the book, the pages flying to the very last two pages. These lines were scrawled shakily, blood splatters coated the bottom of the page.

“November 4, 1835

It’s here. The devil is here in the lighthouse.

I have our children. They are safe for now.

I hear the sounds it is making but I pray to God it does not find us. 

If it does, know that it is wearing the guise of my beloved Juliette. 

May God have mercy on us. My children. My beloved. My soul”

The book slammed closed and I felt my body propelled backward, wind whipping through the floor boards, the walls…

The windows shatter under the weight of the winds outside, howling ungodly wails passing through the once clean and inviting villa. 

“What do you want, Juliette!?” I screamed at her. She, with the fury of the wind, let out a scream that rattled my ear drums. I covered them to protect myself but it seemed to pierce my soul.

“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?” I cried out over the wind. 

In my mind, as if hearing a thought, I heard….

“I…want…my…babies…”

I opened my eyes and looked at her…her dangerous glare was only a mask for the woman under the surface…

“You…were possessed...”

The glare held, but something…changed in her eyes. She reached up with her cold, dead hands and grabbed my face. 

My vision was filled with memory.

The sight of Charleston, Solomon and baby Violet dead on the floor, blood caking Juliette’s hands, the gut-wrenching realization and scream that tore at her throat. She stumbled out to the sea and screamed in anguish. 

She tried to wash the blood of her children and husband from her dress and hands, but no matter what she did, the sea could not take away her sin. She climbed the tower of the lighthouse, standing at the railing before the coals. The stench of gasoline filled the air and the stairs were slick with it. 

She struck the flint once, twice, thrice-

Flames ignited the beacon and ran along the path of gasoline, down the stairs and ended at the end, where the bodies of her children and husband remained. 

She closed her eyes and fell forward onto the coals, the heat overtaking her. The pain was immense, but she welcomed it with open arms. What that evil spirit had made her do had condemned her. Her only option was to leave this world and save as many others as she could.

I fell to the floor, feeling as if my entire body had been drained. Juliette stood up, staring down at me. 

I looked up to her, feeling immense dread and sorrow.

“If…if what you need to move on is to kill me…then go ahead…go see your babies, Juliette.”

The anger in her eyes…dulled.

Her body relaxed and for a moment, the gray gave way to warm olive…her hair from shadow to warm black. The black of her dress was a beautiful green…In that moment, I saw the real Juliette Toulousse-Blackwood- a mother, wife and lost soul.

“M-Merci,” she breathed softly and she was gone. The wind subsided. The hold on my body was gone. I looked around but she was no longer there. In the journal, there was something scratched into the paper. Not written like the other entries, but scratched. 

After regaining my composure I picked the book up and ran over to the kitchenette, flicking on the light and digging around in the drawer for a pencil.

Girl Scouts taught me about rubbing- running a pencil over a surface to create an imprint. I did the same with the paper and discovered something like a map. It showed the old lighthouse. There was a small X that was labeled “Henri” and a few steps away…”Juliette”.

Was her body there? Was she somehow next to her baby she buried in the said?

I stumbled to my feet and ran out to the awning, looking frantically around for a shovel. I found a small shovel stashed in the corner of the sailboat and ran toward the trees, hoping to God I remembered how to get to the old lighthouse.

The sky was turning from a dark purple to light as I approached the ruined lighthouse and whipped the book back out of my back pocket. I examined the rubbing and analyzed the area around it until I was sure I found the spot. I dropped the shovel head to the sand and started to dig. My body was worn, my back burning and bleeding, but my determination driving me forward to find Juliette. 

After digging for what felt like an hours, my shovel hit something hard. I dropped to my knees and used my hands to clear the sand away from the obstruction, not wanting to damage whatever it was underneath.

I finally uncovered a rounded, sandy piece of bone and after digging it out, I was holding a human skull.

My instinct was to throw it and run, but I knew…this was Juliette. She needed to be found and it needed to be me. I continued to dig around the area and found bits and pieces- teeny tiny bones, large leg bones, hips, feet, spine…I found as much of her as I could digging with the smallest shovel I could have possibly find. 

Finally, after the sun had risen, peaked, and set, I had found her. 

With shaky arms, I walked back toward the cemetery and started digging right in front of the grave stone of Juliette Toulousse-Blackwood. I felt exhaustion trying to settle in my bones, but the compulsion to provide peace to the poor woman who was victim to a demon, who took her children and husband’s lives, and who threw herself onto fire to rid the world of this demon was stronger than the need to rest.

I dragged myself over and over to the old lighthouse, picked up sandy bones and took them back to the hold I had dug for Juliette. Once the final set of bones were laid in the hole, I climbed warily out of it and shoved the dirt back over it.

It was a quicker process than digging for sure but no less exhausting. I patted the dirt down over Juliette’s bones and sat back on my knees, breathing heavily and fighting the urge to pass out. I stared at her headstone for the longest time until I felt my body fall, collapsing over the mound I had just created.

The end of the week came and in that time I found purpose. I finished the driveway, I even took the sailboat out with Skip a little ways and met a sweet elderly couple from South America who were visiting their grandchildren in Duck. I decided that this was my new home. I fell head over heels in love with the Outer Banks. I called my job and told them I was going to go remote from North Carolina and they were fine with that. I still have a house in Knoxville to sell, a large storage building to go through with all my shit in it, and a lot of repairs and extensions to do to the villa to accommodate all my stuff while keeping the charm my parents put into the place, but I know I am more than capable of doing it. I want to fulfill my father’s vision of sailing the coastline. I want to make this secluded ocean villa a home. I will be the keeper of the Blackwood Family Cemetery. 

In the shadows of the sun shining over Blackwood Bay, in a clearing that served as a family plot, four graves stood. The freshest grave, laden with flowers and honey suckle read:

Juliette Toulousse-Blackwood

March 28, 1798- Buried May 20, 2024

Beloved Mother and Wife

"Repose au paix"

The End
