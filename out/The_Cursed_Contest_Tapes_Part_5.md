I stopped by the store today and already I'm seeing Halloween decorations. That's a bit early if you ask me. Oh, well, if it makes people happy I don't see the harm in it. At least I managed to get out of the house for a while. Plus, I was able to get a head start and buy decorations for when October rolls around.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With my life update out of the way, it's time for the transcript.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[The decade in which the events the contents of this tape take place seemed to be the early 2000s. In particular, just after the economic crash of 2008 based on prices of goods and certain media shown.\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It should also be noted that this tape is of a comparatively higher quality than the others. It is theorized that the video resolution will reflect that of whatever decade the footage takes place in. This has raised the question then of, what would footage of the future look like. The focus of this tape is a teenager by the name of Russell Bates, aged at least sixteen, and his sister, aged ten. It begins with a periodic beep noise.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage comes into focus to show Russell standing behind a cash register, scanning items. The customer before him is upset with him, telling him that he should be able to have his item refunded. The item in question is a toaster. A glance shows it has been dented in several places as if dropped or hit.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Do you have the receipt for this?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The customer responds, sounding irritated.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Customer:** “No, I didn’t think I would need it, but apparently you morons can’t even sell good toasters.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell's tone conveys exhaustion indicating he’s been through this sort of scenario several times.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “I’m very sorry to hear that, sir. If you paid with a credit card, I can  look up the purchase.”

**Customer:** “I paid in cash so that’s what I expect in return.”

**Russell:** “Again, I apologize sir, but our store policy is that to get a full refund you must be able to prove you purchased the item here. If you like, I could see about giving you store credit instead.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The customer then flies into a rage with the vein on his forehead standing out.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Customer:** “I’ll have you know I’ve been a loyal shopper here for four years, long before your sorry ass stepped behind a register! I want your manager, now!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A stifled sigh escapes Russell. It goes unnoticed by the customer. He grabs a phone by the register and informs his manager of the situation.  The manager shows up and tells Russell to go on break before tending to the irate shopper.  Russell sits on a bench outside and mutters to himself.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:**  “Fucking piece of shit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It then changes to him driving home. It’s only here that his mood changes, The road is empty, giving him the freedom to speed up. Several songs play on the radio which he sings along to.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The sound of a police siren can be heard. Russell sees the flashing lights of one in his rearview and curses. He considers stopping and instead floors the gas, The patrol car accelerates in response. The chase takes about ten minutes. Russell manages to elude the police by making several quick turns and cutting through a slightly obscured dirt road.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He stops on a patch of grass. His hands are trembling and his breathing is heavy. The sirens steadily grow lower. When they are gone, Russell resumes his drive. The footage skips to him reaching home, an apartment complex. He parks and the view pans, showing some groceries in the back and a backpack.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** "Hey, Lisa, did you do good in school today?"

**Lisa:** “Yeah, science class was fun. Mrs. Mullen took us outside.”

**Russell:** “That’s good and how has mom been since you got back?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa frowns.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** “She’s been sleeping a lot again.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell glances past Lisa and sees their kitchen table. Several empty beer bottles are on it. He ground under his breath.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Well, I’ve had a long day, but I’ll grab a bite and then help you with your homework.”

**Lisa:** “Don’t you have some?”

**Russell:** “Yeah, but I can do it later, okay?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa agrees. The footage cuts to them sitting on the couch. Russell is helping her with her report. Upstairs, there is footsteps.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Hey, I think it’s time you got ready for bed. Do you think you can handle the rest of this by yourself?”

**Lisa:** “Yeah, I got the hang of it. Goodnight, Russell.”

**Russell:** “Night, Lisa.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa grabs her things and goes upstairs. Russell unzips his backpack and takes out his schoolwork. As he is working on it, someone comes downstairs. It's his mother. She winces and Russell focuses on his work.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*In the kitchen, she can be heard rummaging through the cabinet. Russell looks and sees her taking some Tylenol. As he returns focus to his work, she comments he needs to shave and that his beard makes him look ugly. This is all she says before returning upstairs. Russell's grip on his textbook tightens.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The next scene shows him talking to his manager. He informs him that due to the current economic status, his employment will have to be terminated. Russell attempts to implore his manager to reconsider only to be met with the same answer. Dejected, he exits the store.  His phone rings and he answers it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** “Russell, I know you said not to call when you were at work but…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa sounds frantic.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “It’s fine. What do you need? Is something wrong?”

**Lisa:** “It’s Mom. She’s not moving!”

**Russell:** “Hang on, what do you mean exactly?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa explains that she found their mother passed out in the kitchen. When she couldn’t find her pulse, she called for help. Russell attempts to calm his sister down.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** "Okay, just stay by her and I'll be home soon."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*When he arrives, an ambulance is parked in front of their home.  He catches a glimpse of his mother whose face is covered before she is put in the back. Lisa is sitting outside on the front porch with a paramedic trying to console her. Some police officers are with them. One approaches Russell. His badge says, Erwin Lambert.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Erwin:** “Now, son I know this is  shocking for you, but I want you to remain calm.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell sounds almost detached in his response.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Do you know what happened to her?”

**Erwin:** “We won’t know for sure until she is examined, but we did find an empty whisky bottle so we’re thinking it’s likey alcohol poisoning. Listen, do you and your sister have a relative who can take you in?”

**Russell:** “Not that I know of.”

**Erwin:** “What about your father?”

**Russell:** “We haven’t spoken to him in years and I have no way to contact him either.”

**Erwin:** “And you’re still a minor, right?”

**Russell:** “Yeah.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Officer Lambert rubs his chin, pondering on what to do.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Erwin:** “I understand this is all a lot to process, but I want you to try to take things easy. Someone will be out to your home soon to help you and your sister.”

**Russell:** “Okay.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The officers and the paramedics leave. Russell and his sister watch them drive away.*

**Lisa:** “Russell?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The view pans and shows Lisa with her eyes red and puffy.  She wipes her nose with her wrist.*

**Lisa:** “What’s going to happen to us?”

**Russell:** “I don’t know, but I’ll make sure we stay together. Does that make you feel any better?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She nods. Russell’s tone perks up some.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Good, now let’s head inside and I’ll fix you something special. How about some pancakes?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa nods again. The scene changes. The two siblings are sharing a stack of pancakes and a pitcher of what appears to be Kool-aid.  What’s shown next is Russell playing Uno with his sister who comes out the victor.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “I think that’s enough for tonight. Go get ready for bed.”

**Lisa:** “Okay, good night.”

**Russell:** “Good night and don’t let the bed bugs bite.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa goes to her room. When she is gone, Russell heads outside on the patio. He is about to sit down when he spots an empty beer bottle that rolled under the table. He picks it up. As he is staring at it, his hand trembles.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He screams in rage and hurls it at a tree. It shatters on the trunk. His breathing becomes more labored.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Fuck…Fuck…Fuck…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He yells again and kicks over the chairs, then flips over the patio table. When he collects himself, he looks up at his sister’s bedroom window. Slowing the footage shows the curtain briefly moving. Russell puts the furniture back as it was and goes back in. A social worker comes to their house.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The short of her visit informs Russell and Lisa that they will be placed in foster care. Lisa is understandably upset and Russell asks how long they have until they have to leave. The social worker replies they have a few days. The footage goes dark and the sound of an engine can be heard. It refocuses and Russell is driving again with Lisa in the back seat.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Luggage along with food is with them.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** “Why won’t you tell me where we’re going?”

**Russell:** “I already told you, far away.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa begins complaining and Russell cuts her off.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Just shut up!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa immeidaltely stops.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Oh, shit, I’m sorry. Look, there’s a lot going on, ya know?”

**Lisa:** “I know. I’m sorry I made you angry.”

**Russell:** “It’s not your fault. Hey, why don’t you play on my DS? It should be in the front pouch of my suitcase. Do you mind if I turn on the radio?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell looks in his rearview and sees Lisa shake her head.*

**Russell:** “Cool.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He begins going through channels. As he does, their names are faintly heard from the speakers. Russell stops and checks on Lisa in his rearview again. Based on her expression, it seems she also noticed it. Russell turns the dial back. Their names get said again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “What the?”

**Lisa:** “Is it broken?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Their names are repeated over and over, becoming significantly louder.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** "Turn it off!"

**Russell:** "I'm trying!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Laughter comes from the speakers. It's none other than Ludus.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Have I gotten your attention, yet?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell feels under the radio, presumably trying to find a microphone or something similar.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** "Look, man, I don't know how you're doing this, but you better knock it the fuck off."

**Ludus:** "That's unfortunate because I wanted to help you."

**Russell:** "What are you talking about?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus introduces itself.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Who or what I am is unimportant. What is important is what I can give you."

**Russell:** "And what would that be?"

**Ludus:** "You and her will never last like this. You know that better than anyone. Don't you?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell is unable to respond. He looks at Lisa again who is also silent.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "But no matter, because I can undo it all. Oh yes, I have that kind of power."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell finds his voice again.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** "What exactly do you want?"

**Ludus:** "To play a game. If you win, your lives will return to the way they were before and stay that way. You'll be one big happy family."

**Russell:** "What if I lose?"

**Ludus:** "Then you're mine. The contest will be a race if you choose to accept. If not, just say so and I'll gladly take my offer elsewhere."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell contemplates.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** "Don't do it, Russell! I don't know what that thing is, but it scares me!"

**Russell:** "Yeah, me too. I can't take care of you like this, though. Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*In his rearview, his sister is staring wide-eyed.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** "I accept."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why didn't he listen to his sister? I know he wanted what was best for her, but god damn it, this kind of shit never leaves you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:**  "Very well, let the game begin."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The mood changes as if time is coming to a standstill.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was one of the most eerie moments I've come across in these videos. The best way I can describe it is it's like animals going quiet because they know a predator is nearby.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A rumbling approaches Russell's car. In his side mirror, he sees a figure rapidly getting closer. What stops by them is something vaguely humanoid. It's as if a person was born quadrupedal instead of bipedal. Its skin resembles sandpaper and its eyes are sunken to the point no color can be discerned.  In place of its mouth is a speaker.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa can be heard crying from the back. Russell tightens his grip on his steering wheel.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "This will be my vessel for the duration of our game."

**Russell:** "Where's the finish going to be?"

**Ludus:** "You'll see a blue line. It could be at some random light, a lamp post, a tree, or even an abandoned gas station. Not even I know when it will appear. That's why this is so fun. Oh, and I hope you don't mind a little change of scenery.."

**Lisa:** "What does that mean?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Her question is ignored when Ludus counts down.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** "Three…two…one…go!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Both competitors shoot off like bullets out of smoking guns.  The race is straightforward at first with one racer trying to pass the other. This goes on for about half an hour.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The way it moved irks me. Do you all remember those little robot dogs? Imagine something moving similar to that except somehow it's way faster.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell attempts to pass Ludus when suddenly the land changes. The road breaks apart, revealing a lake of lava.  In it, are hundreds of people who are screaming in agony.  Swimming around them are lobster-like creatures. One grabs several people in a claw and crushes them.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Instead of dying, they vanish from the claw and reappear screaming in the lava. This happens repeatedly to the victims of this ordeal. Russell checks on Lisa in the rearview. She’s in shock. Ludus effortlessly evades claws and jets of lava that shoot onto the road.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Meanwhile, Rsusell has to swerve to avoid puddles of lava that are now on the road. A claw swipes at his car from the side and he swerves to dodge it, nearly falling off. Although he manages to straighten out, Ludus is now in the lead by a wide margin. He spots a part of the path that resembles a ramp.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Lisa?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She doesn’t say anything but does make eye contact with him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Hang on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He slams the gas. His car goes over the ramp, making the vehicle airborne. It lands in front of Ludus. It isn’t pleased. Now, everything looks normal again and a  faint strip of blue light is up ahead.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Hey, I think I see the finish line! I’m going to win, Lisa!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All I have to say at this point is pride cometh before the fall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Lisa smiles upon hearing Russell’s words. The finish line is located at a lamp post which is the only thing casting light other than Russell’s headlights.  Ludus is several feet behind them and Russell constantly changes lanes to prevent it from passing. Russell makes a bee line for the finish when something appears in the road. Although brief, it costs Russell his victory.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Slowing the footage shows Lisa and Russell’s mother. She appears to be younger compared to the time of her death. With her is a bearded man who heavily resembles Russell.  Cursing, he jerks the wheel. Due to the velocity, he loses control of his vehicle and slams into a tree. The windshield and front windows shatter on impact.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Shit, I was so close.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Russell looks down and sees shards sticking from his hands. A trickle of red spills over the view.  He wipes away some blood from his face. With a pained hiss, he turns around to check on Lisa. She’s unconscious with blood trickling down her nose.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Lisa!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Tapping comes from the outside of the driver's door. Ludus in its vessel is now back beside Russell’s car.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “You…Cheated…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus tilts its head in confusion.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Hardly, I have no control of how a game behaves as it plays out. That would defeat the entire purpose. Let me give you some parting advice as a courtesy. Winners don’t hesitate. Now then…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Wait.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus stops.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “This was between you and me.”

**Ludus:** “Very well.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus steps back. Russell opens the door and falls out. Ludus stares down at him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I  have to congratulate you on such a close game. Unfortunately, this is where our fun ends.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Amber cracks appear in the road.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:**  “Russell!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He sees that his sister has regained consciousness. She scrambles out of the vehicle. The ground rumbles and out of it comes two pairs of burnt hands, one belonging to a man and the other a woman. They grab Russell by the arms. Faces emerge with them.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It’s their mother and the man she was with. Their faces are rotted and parts of their skulls show in several places. They tell Russell that it’s time for him to go. He looks from them and Ludus to Lisa.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Russell:** “Sorry I lied.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*With a yank, he is pulled down. His sister screams his name again and tries to grab for him, unsuccessfully. This is the last thing shown as the ground reseals itself, concluding the tape.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How many times can you say how horrible something is? Have you ever had someone tell you something that shook you to your core? Then you wanted to give some sort kind of sage-like advice that would help them see the light. Then all that you can muster is either “Damn, sorry to hear that” or “That really sucks”. That’s how I’ve felt watching every last one of these goddamn tapes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Do you know what the worst part is, the one that has kept me up for days straight?  It’s the fact that it seems as if I’m the only one who truly understands the threat here. Sure, Dean and Stella have been helping out. However, even they don’t seem to fully grasp the seriousness of the situation. Why only I can, I have no idea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I actually do have some good news and it all has to do with a conversation I had over the phone. Through some research, I was able to find Lisa’s portfolio online. I don’t want to give her place of work for privacy reasons. Just know I had to schedule an appointment to talk with her. I think mentioning Ludus shortened the days I waited.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got a call from her only a couple days after I watched the tape. I’ll transcribe this conversation as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** “Hello?”

**Lisa:** “Has it gotten someone you love too?”

Her question took me aback.

**Me:** “No, but I’ve had to see how much pain it’s caused and I’m trying to bring a stop to it. Did you see anything at all during when it took your brother that might help? Anything at all?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She’s silent for a moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Lisa:** “I’ve blocked out most of that night, but I do remember something it said. It told my brother winners don’t hesitate.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was the second time I heard that. Maybe there’s something to glean from it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** “I see, just out of curiosity, what happened after the encounter?”

**Lisa:** “I don’t want to give my whole life story. The short of it is, a family came across me walking alongside the road and picked me up. Eventually, they ended up adopting me.”

**Me:** “At least that’s somewhat of a happy ending.”

**Lisa:**  “Yes, I’m grateful, but I miss Russell every day.”

**Me:** “ I can’t imagine dealing with and I’m sorry it’s taken me this long to do something to stop it.”

**Lisa:** “You seem like a good guy so I want to say this. I don’t know why you’re after it, but I would just leave it alone if I were you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To my surprise, a laugh escaped my lips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Me:** “Believe me. I wish I could."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is where I have to leave things off.  I probably won’t be posting for a while due to a mission we’re supposed to be going on. I don’t know anything about it other than we’re supposed to be investigating some kind of [distress message.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15sjokl/they_came_with_the_rain/) Wish me luck it’s not anything too serious.
