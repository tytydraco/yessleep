Someone - or thing - walked into my diner last night

I work the night shift at this dingy little diner on the outskirts of town. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Tonight though, I wish I had called in sick.  


​

  
The place is dead quiet, except for the faint hum of the neon sign outside. I wipe down the counter for what feels like the hundredth time, trying to keep myself occupied. That's when he walks in.  


​

  
The guy looks completely ordinary at first glance. Average height, average build, wearing a worn-out jacket that's seen better days. But there's something off about him. His eyes are wide open, like he's staring right through you. It sends a shiver down my spine, but I force a smile and greet him.

​

  
He takes a seat at the far end of the counter, his gaze never leaving me. I try to shake off the feeling of unease as I walk over to take his order. His voice is low and gravelly, sending a chill down my spine as he orders a black coffee.

​

  
I pour his drink with trembling hands, feeling his eyes boring into the back of my head the entire time. I quickly slide the mug across the counter, eager to put some distance between us. But as I turn away, I catch a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror behind the bar.

​

  
His expression is... wrong. It's like his face is frozen in a twisted grin, his eyes still wide and staring. I feel a knot form in my stomach as I try to rationalize what I just saw.

​

  
I try to focus on my work, but I can feel his presence lingering behind me like a shadow. Every time I glance in his direction, he's watching me with those unnerving eyes.  


​

  
As the night drags on, the diner empties out until it's just me and him. I try to busy myself with cleaning tasks, but I can feel his gaze burning into the back of my skull.  


​

  
Finally, unable to take it anymore, I muster up the courage to approach him. "Is everything alright, sir?" I ask, my voice trembling.  


​

  
He doesn't respond at first, just continues to stare at me with that haunting gaze. Then, in a voice that sends shivers down my spine, he speaks. "You shouldn't be here alone," he says, his words dripping with malice.

​

  
I feel a cold sweat break out across my forehead as I stumble backwards, my heart pounding in my chest. Without another word, I turn and bolt for the door, desperate to escape his chilling presence.  


​

  
As I burst out into the cool night air, I glance back at the diner one last time. The man is still sitting there, his eyes fixed on me with a look that sends a chill down my spine.

​

  
I don't stop running until I'm safely back home, but even then, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched. And as I lay in bed, trying to push the memory of those haunting eyes from my mind, I can't help but wonder... what was he? And what did he want from me?
