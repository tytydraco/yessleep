\[Hey, all. I’m posting here based on the recommendation of a friend. I frequently travel the Appalachian trails in my home state during the summers; sometimes alone, sometimes with a group of friends. What I’m about to detail here was my experience last week, as it left me baffled and searching for any shred of rationality in the face of the irrational. 

Apologies ahead of time for being sparse on concrete details. I've been a bit shaken from the experience, and all over the place as of late. I also want to keep the location a secret for now. It comes from a selfish place, as I want to be the first to break the case if this ends up being genuine evidence of something… super-natural. I’m hesitant to use that word, but I have no idea what else it could be at this point. I also don’t trust people to not come over here and tamper with the area for a funny joke at my expense. As for what I found…

I was walking through a deeply forested trail, when the walkable path curved sharply into a dead end. Not a natural one, either. It was like a bomb had gone off in the area. There was a large pit in the center, as if a drill about 30 feet wide dug 50 feet down. Trees surrounding the area were either lopsided or fallen, but all of them had intense fire scarring.  

In the center of the pit, at the bottom, was a leather journal. On the front cover, someone had carved the words **“THE HEART OF MAN”**. Looking inside, there was something on the inner binding that had been scratched off. From what I’ve read of the journal so far, I assume it to have been the name of the owner and a phone-number. Written above this damaged portion, **“Sun”**. Surprisingly (given the state of the surrounding area), the journal was incredibly intact besides that. All the actual written pages seem to be completely undamaged and legible.

I’m not sure how long it’s been here, but the trees have had enough time to heal and grow back their leaves from whatever happened. It was on top of… some sort of skeleton. I think it’s an elk skeleton, going off the skull. Massive thing. 

I’ll try to upload a picture of the journal when I can. I’m working with a laptop and a mobile hotspot in the middle of nowhere, even loading up this website took a substantial amount of time. In the meantime I’ve been reading through the journal and transcribing it as I go. I’ve done a general search of the surrounding areas, but none of the maps I have match the description the writer has given so far, so I assume this journal has traveled quite a ways to get where it is now. 

My hope is, by sharing this with you all, you might be able to pick up on stuff faster than I have, or find things I missed. I’ve read ahead to the second entry, so after I post this I’ll be moving based on what I found in it. When I’m settled into the new area, I’ll post the next entry. Sorry if I’m sparse until then, I’ll try to read your comments and reply when I can.

Until then, here’s the contents of the first entry.\] 

**May 30th**

If you are reading this journal, I hope it was by my own choice to show you the words penned here. I see it as critical to record my thoughts on paper, should I never be able to relay them by voice. I hope I’m speaking these words to you directly, as a changed person, wiser from the experience. If I’m not, and you’ve discovered this in search for me, or are carting me off to the morgue, I’m sorry. Thank you for at least managing to find this, so I am not simply another voice lost to the woods. I’m a fool, compelled by curiosity to search for knowledge despite common sense, warnings, and ill omens. 

If you’re reading this, I have a few things to ask. Please do not follow in my foot-steps. Satisfy your curiosity if you like by reading this, but contact the police immediately. On the inside of the binding, I’ve written my name, as well as how to contact my family. Give it to them, so my story does not go untold. 

A year ago, my uncle went missing. 

None of my family knows where he went. While no one wants to say it out loud, a lot of us have been making peace with the fact he's likely dead. 

My uncle was a strange case. Not in a bad way, mind you. He was just… anti-social. Kept to himself. Never texted anyone unless it was necessary. He'd show up once a year to family gatherings, share a few words with us (mostly with my mother) over drinks and dinner. Though, he only started attending these gatherings the year after my grandfather (his father) passed.

After that, he'd be gone again. For a whole year. He lived on about a dozen acres of Appalachian forest he owned. He had moved out when my mother went off to college, working every job he could to afford to escape from the world onto his own piece of land. When my mom and I visited his place years ago, I mostly remember being consumed by boredom. Like any dumb teenager glued to their cell phone, I didn't understand why he'd want to live so reclusively and detached from the city. 

But, I get it now. There’s a harsh, violent noise to city life. You get used to it when you live in it, but it’s hard not to feel like a cog in the machine when you spend day after day inside it. It offers its conveniences, but has its downsides, as well.  I can't say for certain whether my uncle was better off for secluding himself from the modern world, but I do understand it. Though, if he hadn’t been so reclusive, there’s a good chance we wouldn’t be mourning him right now. 

There was a manhunt for him, of course. County police searched for him. We searched for him. The police never found anything pointing toward foul play. And, while the wilderness has plenty of dangerous predators, my uncle was an experienced outdoorsman. He knew all there was to know about surviving in the area he lived in. Had there been a freak accident, or some animal attack, the search parties certainly didn't find any trace of it. 

He was here one day, and the next he had stepped off the face of the Earth. 

The search efforts weighed heavily on my family, especially my mother. She took his disappearance the hardest. If anyone could get him to pick up the phone, it was her. After hours of bounced calls, day after day, she ended up finally breaking down. She knew something had happened. Worse, she knew there was nothing she could do about it. I’ve spent mornings, afternoons, and evenings doing my best to comfort her. The tears came at random, and frequently. I didn’t blame her for it, I just did my best to help. 

She told me a lot of stories about him in his absence. It paints a distinctly different picture compared to the uncle I knew. 

The one that sticks out in my mind is a trick he'd always do to cheer her up. When she was feeling down, he'd make a makeshift tent out of blankets and pillows. Afterwards, he'd invite her in and close it up. He'd ask her where they were. When she'd answer "Home, duh", he'd correct her. *Actually,* they were deep in a mysterious Appalachian forest; far away from the suburbs, far away from the problems troubling them. He'd paint a vivid picture of the foothills and the strong trees that sprouted from them, descriptions straight from botanical books and trail guides he collected. He'd mime as if he were listening for animals and mimic them with his voice. This is always what got her to start smiling again. The impersonations were so bad, she'd burst out laughing at them.

As my mom shared these charming anecdotes and family stories, I felt a knot in my stomach forming; the familiar, twisting pains of regret. It made me realize how little I knew the man. Can’t blame him for that, though. I was always more interested in trading cards and video games than the forests he was so fond of. If I had been more conversational myself, moping less about being stuck somewhere so “boring”, I *could* have known him better. 

What those stories made clear, was that beyond his reserved exterior, he cared deeply for his loved ones. I wish I got to know him better. Or rather, I wish I had taken the time to reach out more and *get* to know him better. Although he kept to himself, I could have tried to connect with him more. It’s likely I don't have that opportunity now. 

My mother painted a more complete picture of him, but it felt disjointed from the man I grew up knowing. He kept a lot about him close to his chest, even with her. She told me as much. From what she said though, he didn't seem like the kind of man to leave his sister, his best friend, alone like this. It felt like there was a missing puzzle piece in the jigsaw of my uncle's identity. That inherent mystery about him lingered in my mind, making me reflect more and more about his disappearance. There had to be more, something that my mother didn't know. 

As she recalled our time spent with him, my thoughts returned to his log home in deep Appalachia. The memories of that endless expanse of forest came back to me in vivid detail. Now though, the recollection was tainted by my uncle's disappearance. I recalled the towering oaks and pines, the luscious hickory trees scattering sunlight between their leaves. In these tranquil woods, I saw them as looming sentinels, guarding buried secrets. The comfort of a campfire felt like a pointed transgression against them. The smell of damp earth brought to mind all the death and decay that enriched its soil. It was hard to clear the black clouds coloring these memories, the recent tragedy blowing a terrible storm-front to smother them. The forest itself had become a malevolent entity to me. 

I guess I needed something to blame. 

While his disappearance left us all searching for answers, it also stirred something within me. I started to recognize my own tendency to pull away from the world. I spent most of my college life buried in studies, never seeking new connections with the people around me. I graduated recently, though, wrapping up my last few classes just as he disappeared; imagining my degree as a license on competently navigating life, I figured everything would make sense after I finished it. I'm in my late twenties now, and I'll be honest. Life doesn't make any more sense than it did when I turned eighteen. 

I still had no real idea who I was or what I was supposed to be doing. I expressed this to my mother, and after a long discussion, we both agreed that I should try living in my uncle's log home. He had written a will shortly after he moved into the place, just in case something happened to him, and wanted her to have the place if it did. I brought up my growing disillusionment with city life. I talked about how hard it was for me to find kinship in other people, when I had never taken the time to figure out the person *I* was. While staying here for a while would be even further isolation, we both thought it might be a therapeutic one. With how busy every day was in the heart of urban society, I rarely had time to simply *exist* and reflect on myself. I actively pursued meaningless distractions with what time I *did* have to keep myself from doing so. By self-isolating and putting myself in my uncle’s shoes, I could stand to learn more about both of us. 

Not that it wasn’t still a scary idea to me. I'd be living completely by myself for the first time. Not only that, but... I still couldn't shake that eerie feeling about those woods. About his disappearance. Yes, they didn't find anything suspicious in the house, or the surrounding forests. It doesn't make his disappearance any less terrifying to me. The fact that anyone could vanish the way he did is haunting. I had to wonder if I could vanish without a trace as he did.

When I first arrived, my anxieties were eased a bit. My mom offered to sleep there for a few nights with me until I got used to it. It was the closest I felt to her in a long time. 

The night before she left, we made a small campfire by the house. It felt surreal seeing so many stars in the night sky. With the light pollution in the city, you could only pick out a few here and there. Out here, though, it was like the layer separating us and the grand majesty of space had disappeared. I stared out into the wild starry expanse, my mother filling my ears with stories of her own camping trips. My uncle took her out of the house pretty often to go camping with him. He'd teach her basic wilderness skills and cook over the campfire with her. When she struggled to go to sleep, he'd point out constellations, spilling endless details about them until she fell asleep. Some time later, she’d wake up to the smell of a roasting breakfast, comfortably tucked into her sleeping bag. My grandfather wasn't so happy about these trips. He often berated my uncle for leaving the house "without his permission". Though, according to my mom, grandpa seemed more angry that he *took her with him* specifically. 

After a long night of stories, we both went to bed. The day after, she checked that the house phone worked at least two dozen times and made me promise to call if anything went wrong. She left behind all sorts of guides on the surrounding wilderness, as well. After settling in a bit more the nights she was with me, though, it felt a bit excessive. I was much more comfortable with the place after spending more time in it. Considering what had happened to my uncle, though, I understood her caution. I appreciated it, with how nervous I was about coming here in the first place. 

Now, a week later, I feel my anxiety returning; it feels like seeing ripples in a glass of water before an earthquake. 

There's something wrong with these woods.

At first, I tried to dismiss a lot of the signs as things I was merely unused to. If you've ever heard the call of a mountain lion before, you know what I'm talking about. As beautiful as nature is, it can produce some of the most horrifying sounds imaginable. Even the sound of the wind was nerve-wracking at first. The sound of hundreds of trees creaking around me after a sudden gust, or the howl of the wind against the windows at night, startling me when I was trying to sleep. 

Last night, I was having trouble sleeping, too. Upstairs, in what was once my uncle’s bedroom, I tried to relax in his bed, reading through the various books and guides by the light of a lamp on the bedside table. Through studying these books and the guides my mother left, I was able to better understand and identify the sounds of wildlife common to the area. Nature was scary, sure; a lot less so when you understood the sounds from the woods were your ordinary critter and not roaming packs of demons. My paranoia of the forest faded again as my understanding of it grew. Then, I heard *it*.

*It* was something not of this world. Picture in your head the sound of someone screeching at the top of their lungs. The screech starts low and rises in pitch as it goes. Now funnel that through a bugle, and make that sound bellow like wicked thunder reverberating through the mountains and between the trees.

I froze. Hearing it instilled an intense, primal fear in me, only comparable to the instinctual feeling of being alone for the first time as a child. Mankind was not meant to be a part of these woods, and I was an unwanted intruder. Despite the terror gripping me, I felt compelled to at least look for the source. 

I crept downstairs as quietly as I could manage. The old, weak plank steps creaked from the pressure. I never realized how exposed I was in this house until then. Where windows were once a source of warm morning sunlight, the small square glass panes now felt like observation windows. 

And I was a specimen pinned in a wooden box. 

My heart pounded in my chest. The paranoia made me want to drop to the floor and crawl to the front door, desperate to avoid meeting the gaze of anything outside. I barely resisted the urge. It felt to me like some unforeseen observer would look down on me even further if I did. I paced around the first floor, closing the curtains on all the windows as fast as I could. As I reached the two closest to the front door, I finally peered outside. 

I could see a pair of lights out in the woods– flickering, like distant candles. As I stared out into the labyrinthine woods toward them, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something beyond those flames was peering right back at me. Looking closer, I could glimpse the faintest hint of brown fur surrounding those flames; a great beast, of which the bulk of its form was cast in darkest shadow. Far above it, deep in the night sky, the clouds parted. Silver moonbeams cascaded through the leafy canopy of the woods, landing on the forest floor and pouring outwards across the tall grass below. The moonlight caught the massive, ivory antlers atop its head, of which proudly jutted skyward; they curved and tangled into each other in an intricate symmetry, forming into a distinct pattern that resembled that of a dreamcatcher.  A wind picked up, shaking the trees and stirring the rustling leaves into a deafening chorus, as if to announce its arrival with rapturous grandeur befitting that of an angel come to earth.

For reasons I still cannot justify in my own head, I felt a familiarity with this creature. The feeling wasn’t sensible, or borne of logic. It came from my gut, and nothing more. As bone-chilling as the beast’s initial call was, all I could feel beholding it was a sense of peace washing over me. Without realizing it, I had pressed my hand against the window, as if to reach out to it, spellbound; but as soon as I noticed what I was doing, the trance I was under shattered. I shook my head, rubbing my eyes and staring out the window with a renewed focus. 

The beast was gone. It left behind only trampled grass and thunderous hoofbeats in its absence. The wind calmed. The moon still shined; and I felt a profound loneliness in the wake of this event. The silence that followed was deafening and hollow, the forest feeling almost empty with its disappearance. Still in a daze, I checked the kitchen clock. 

Four A.M. 

I couldn't remember when I had come down here. I couldn’t remember staying up that late, but I might have lost track of time. My body at least *felt* like hours had passed since I’d come downstairs. I was exhausted beyond belief. I did my best to check all the windows and doors to make sure they were locked. I dragged myself back upstairs, locked the bedroom door, and collapsed onto the bed; staring up at the ceiling, I tried to commit to memory what had happened– as if it were some bizarre dream, and there was a possibility I could forget it if I didn’t make the conscious effort to remember. The more I mentally poured over the details of the encounter, the more doubt crept into my mind as to the legitimacy of what I saw. I had no reason to doubt myself, however. I have never experienced bouts of delusion, or hallucinations.

The adrenaline fading from my body left an overwhelming exhaustion in its wake, serving as an additional reminder of my wakeful lucidity. As the shock of the encounter faded, and I was left playing the details of it in my head over and over, the more that dread started to overtake my mind. A deep, primal fear, pulling my eyes back to the door and screaming at me to take flight, run far, far, far away from here. I still had my car. I could get my keys, get in, and never come back. It was incredibly tempting. I also considered calling my mother. She had just taken the trip back home, though, one that was a few days’ drive. There was no doubt in my mind that she'd drive back here without a second thought if I needed her. I didn't want to worry her, though. This whole trip was meant to help me find myself and to understand my uncle better. At least, as far as she knew. But, there was another reason. This was the same one holding me back from calling her, or driving away from this place as fast as I could. 

Selfish curiosity. 

I'm sure if I was clear about my intentions of trying to dig up more info about my uncle's disappearance, she wouldn't be too happy. Not just because of my half-truths, but because she wouldn't want me getting hurt. I'm not so apathetic that I can't see this from her perspective. But I have to know. It’s, again, selfish, and awful of me; but I’ve never felt such a clear sense of purpose in my entire life. 

I'm making sure to keep a record of everything that has happened here in regards to my investigation, and everything I plan on doing in the following days. I'm going to put this in a safe place every time I finish an entry, somewhere easy to find. On the off-chance something happens to me, even a cursory search of this place will turn up this journal. For clarity, this entry was written the night following the disturbing events detailed here. I'm watching the sunset from a campfire I made on a hill overlooking the house, and the view is beautiful. As I write this line, it's starting to sink below the lush, distant mountain tops. The warm orange glow bathes the valley and hills, and shimmers against the emerald foliage that adorns them. With each word, it sinks lower, and lower… the receding sun pulling a blanket of dusk over the sky.

Darkness lovingly embraces the land. With the night comes a renewed wave of anxiety that seeps into my mind and wrings my heart. I can’t help but wonder what the forest might have in store for me tonight. Even though I can easily see the house from here, I still feel nervous about making my way back there. It may only be a couple minutes walk, but my imagination fills in the spaces where my eyes cannot see with crawling horrors beyond description. 

Tomorrow, when it's light out, I plan on mapping out the forest. Slowly, of course, learning my way around it. I found some old flag markers my uncle used, and I plan on using those to keep track of where I've been, as well as the paths back. There's also a small town down the road I plan on visiting later. My mom showed me pictures and reviews of some places down there, and it looked… cozy. It might be a nice, if brief, place of respite if the events here get too much for me. I still plan on spending the majority of time in the house, regardless of what happens, as it’s my biggest lead on the truth of what happened here. It *is* at least somewhat comforting knowing that there are people at least somewhat nearby. I just have to hope they’re welcoming to a total stranger. 

Before I close off this first entry, though, there's one more thing I want to record. 

My dream last night. 

After I finally passed out, I had a very restless slumber. Usually, my dreams are very uneventful, or incomprehensible. A couple minutes after I wake up, I forget them. 

This one caused me to wake up in a cold sweat. I can't shake the imagery from my mind. It was too vivid, and left me with a lingering sense of dread and nausea. 

I'm deep in the forest. So deep, I can't see a path back. I'm completely lost. 

And there's a gun in my hands. 

An old hunting rifle. I've never even held a pistol, but holding this rifle feels like second nature to me. The weight of it feels comforting, like a night-light to ward off the monsters under my bed. Ahead is a cave, its inner mouth pitch black. 

All of a sudden, I don't feel so lost. I feel like I'm right where I need to be. Like a knight from a storybook, coming to slay a dragon. Ahead of me, the cave rumbles and roars. Flames lick from the entrance and a shadow emerges from the bellowing inferno. Without hesitation, I shoulder the rifle and aim at the shape. It isn't a conscious decision on my part. I'm as in control as someone watching a bodycam, but I still feel everything I'm doing. 

I squint at the thing. It's lumbering forward from the cave, and it's huge. Bigger than anything I've seen before. There's no way I could put it down. I can't make out a single detail, as it blocks all the light behind it and eclipses the sun. 

Yet, my hands have never been steadier. The second the sight of the rifle passes over the bridge between its glowing eyes, I squeeze the trigger. A deafening bang echoes across the valley as the stock kicks into my shoulder. The bullet violently spins along its trajectory. It rips through the air and screams in defiance against the wind. With a sickening crack, it hits its target, boring through bone and burying itself in the thing’s brain. The figure staggers, crumples, and falls. 

As it lays face first in the dirt, drowning in a pool of its blood...

It doesn't look so big anymore. 

A foreign sense of pride swells in my chest, and I shine a flashlight over its body to identify the thing. 

It's not a *thing*, a monster, but a person. I recognize his clothes. His old flannel shirt, the colors worn from time’s embrace; the belt, the leather worn and stitches frayed; his thick denim jeans bleached by the sun. I reach over with my boot, hesitantly turning the body face-up. I recognize the shape of his face, wrinkled from the weight of decades of wisdom. Even with the blood pooling from and caking against his broken face, I know without a shadow of a doubt who it is. 

It’s my grandfather.
