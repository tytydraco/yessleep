September 23, 1999 my husband received the electric chair. It makes me sick calling him my husband. That man was a monster. 

On the day of his execution I felt devastated,  but what I felt the most was humiliation. My entire life I had been associated with that man. When the photos of the victims body’s were leaked to the public eye, the entire town looked at me with disgust. They asked me how I couldn’t have caught on sooner. My husband had killed 8 people, but I like to believe he killed 9. He killed me. 26 years I loved and cherished him. I loved him more than anything or anybody in the world. 

He was the best husband anyone could’ve asked for, he took me to the Paris for our honeymoon, my dream vacation. He paid for everything we did on that trip and our entire marriage I’ve been trying to find a way to repay him.

 When we were in our 20s I would wait on the front steps for him to pull into the driveway after work. I’d always be wearing that beautiful expensive dress he bought me in Paris. I would be so filled with joy, after being alone at home all day. Seeing my husband coming home, too me was the most exciting thing in the whole world. 

We barely ever had arguments, and the rare occasions in which we did, he’d always find a way to turn it onto himself. 

7 years have past and I’m living with my mother. Yesterday I answered a call on the landline from an unknown caller. The voice I heard from the other end made me drop the phone from my hands. My mother came from the other room when she heard me panic.  My mother then picked the phone up and he was still on the call.

“Who are you” my mother said, speaking into the phone. She then said “what do you want” she paused for a about 30 seconds. I could see her face going pale, and could literally hear the blood pumping through her heart. She then said “how are you alive” Those words hit me like a sledgehammer to the chest. How the fuck was he alive. My mom then dropped the phone, she then reached for the railing. 

“What did he say mom!”I screamed
“What the fuck did he say” My mom then collapsed to the ground. Her face looked horrified like she’s seen all of hell. 

I then heard his voice, it was so loud, it felt like the whole house was vibrating. His voice sounded deeper, and devilish.

“You don’t know how much I’ve missed you, Sarah” 

Tears poured down my face as I aided my mother.

His voice echoed through the entire house again. 

“Don’t you remember when I took the blame for you” My mothers eyes widened. 

“What is he talking about?” My mother shouted.

“We murdered those 8 people together” those words echoed through the house. I then crushed the phone. I didn’t want my mother to hear anymore of what he was saying. Unfortunately my mother had already heard enough.

“Sarah, you monster” my mother said. I then went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. I stabbed her in the throat. 

Me and my husband killed those 8 victims together. One of the reasons I love my husband so much is that he would always find a way to turn it onto himself. 

From behind me I could here footsteps. 

“You made me proud, Sarah” I turned around and jumped into his arms. 

He then said “let’s find a place to hide this body, like how we used to do it”
