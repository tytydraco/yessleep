The first time I saw him doing.. It.. Was on a Saturday afternoon.  

I’d had to work the morning, and called into the supermarket after my shift to pick up a few groceries.  
Usually Jason and I spent our Saturdays exploring the outdoors, so when I got home around 2pm, I saw his car in the drive, but no Jason around.  

I shrugged it off, maybe he’d gone out to do some walking around the woods near our home, and forgot to mention it to me.  

I spent a good while in the kitchen, putting away the groceries and then making my self a cup of coffee.  
I kept waiting to hear Jason walk in the door, but I never did.  

So it was to my utmost surprise when I walked into the lounge, coffee in hand, and saw Jason standing in the middle of the room, legs spread and arms outstretched.  

I stood motionless, watching. Waiting for him to move. To continue doing the star jump it looked as if he was frozen part way doing.  
But he never moved. He just stood still, in the same position.  

After another few awkward moments, I was starting to feel uncomfortable. I gave a little cough, a clear of my throat to let him know I was in the room, but he didn’t respond.  

It was bizarre, and even though I’d never, ever, been scared of him before, I was absolutely terrified. Especially when he wasn’t responsive. I threatened to call an ambulance if he didn’t respond immediately. I was getting quite hysterical.   

Jason stood, not moving a muscle. His eyes stared back at me, but it was as if there was nothing there, they looked blank.   

I ran with a gasp to the kitchen to retrieve my handbag and phone, before returning to the lounge, where Jason was no where to be seen.   
Not knowing where he was felt worse than having him standing in front of me.   
I slowly walked around. Tentatively calling out to him. I was met with silence.   

I had gone through every room, not finding him anywhere. I contemplated the police, but what would I say? My husband was standing weird?   
I had almost given up on finding him, when I saw the whites of his eyes, peeking out from the walk in cupboard in the kitchen.   

His stance was the same, the vacant look in his eyes unchanging. The only different thing was, he was smiling. Not an evil, psychotic grin like you’d see on a horror film, no he looked quite peaceful and almost smug with happiness.   
Even though his smile isn’t scary, it makes me feel nervous still. I can’t really put my finger on why.  

I’ve tried to talk to him, threaten to phone the police or an ambulance, but there’s nothing really physically wrong with him, and he’s not acting out of hand.. so I don’t know what they’d say or do.   

Whenever I look away from him, even just for a second as I type this out, he is gone. It’s taken me hours upon hours to type this.. Between having to find him again.. For some reason, I don’t feel quite safe when I can’t see him.. and once I do eventually find where’s he’s standing, the cycle repeats. He stays still, in that frozen star jump until I look up and he’s gone, waiting for me to find him again.  

I have no idea what to do.
