I sat in a corner office. Somewhere a clock ticked in agony, mocking my anxious demeanor. It had been a trying few days. They found Trevor face down in a pool of his own filth, his head blown in, grey matter splattered all over his satin sheets.

If that hadn’t been tragic enough, it had fallen to me to explain to Angie how her husband; the beloved state senator, hadn’t been found alone.

The scandal broke something in her; she just sat there like she was in a trance. Her once thoughtful eyes were now distant and hollow. I left her to wallow in her grief while I picked up the pieces of the brother I thought I knew. 

I was waiting for the ADA handling his case, supposedly they had news. Out of boredom more than anything, I examined the office. It was fairly swank, fully furnished with a polished oak desk and the walls were adorned with various certificates.

Law degrees, photos of a short yet looming woman shaking hands with gargoyle looking men in suits. There were even a few pages ripped from the headlines; hung like hunting trophies. 

“**SOUTH END BUTCHER APPREHENDED**”

“**THE DEAD Walk? Killer Medium Cleared of all charges”**

It all sounded pretty high-profile, so I was glad Trevor’s case seemed to be in good hands. Part of me didn't want them to work too hard, as gruesome as it sounded. I just wanted this nightmare to be over with so we could all move on.

The ticking sound was starting to get to me. The whole room had this scent to it, like strawberry perfume was lacing the air. The scent tickled my nostrils and twitched at it. There was a slight buzzing noise, faint enough to just be irritating. The fluorescent lights shone on, the drapes in there felt velvet to the touch and were drawn.

The ADA’s desk was littered with paperwork and interlocking coffee rings. There was a picture on her desk, sister maybe? Though with the way she was holding the timid looking redhead I hoped not. 

Behind me the office door exploded, and I heard pointed heels clicking against the floor. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her for the first time.

She wore a form fitting suit with flowing pants to match. There was an olive tone to her skin, it seemed to shimmer in the synthetic light. Her hair was raven black and flowed down her back like a raging river. She was red in the face, bickering with someone on her phone, weariness draping her tone.

Her hazel eyes regarded me with a hint of sympathy-the first bit I had experienced all week. She brushed past me, and I got a fresh whiff of berries. 

“-Yes Mary, I’ll pick it up after work. Huh? No-No I, No I don’t-you’re talking too fast, I can’t talk to you right now I’m- yes exactly.” The woman sat across from me and shot me an embarrassed glance. 

“Ok-I’ll talk to you later Mare, love ya to hun.” She snapped her phone to the desk in a huff, an exhausted sigh slipping out of her mouth. “Sorry. A friend of mine moved and we’re having a party for her this weekend. Fun stuff.” She flashed a smile and I felt my tension melt away as she did. 

“It’s fine. It’s nice to finally make your acquaintance miss-?” I trailed off as she waved a hand at me. 

“Call me Lucy, please. I wish we were meeting under better circumstances Joseph. Your brother was a major contributor to the DA’s office for years, we were all crushed by his loss.” She said, her soft voice dripping with empathy. It was almost convincing.

“I’m sure you were less thrilled about how he was found.” I barked at her. Her face twitched and she dropped the pleasantries as she leaned in. 

“That’s an understatement. The girl’s family is suing the state you know. It’ll be taken care of out of court most likely, hopefully whatever number they come up with will provide some semblance of comfort. Won’t bring their daughter back of course but-” She shrugged. 

“I want you to know we-I had no idea. I had an inkling-”

“Inkling?” She raised an eyebrow as she reached below her desk. 

“-Him and Ange had been having problems for a while, she confided in me that she suspected him of having an affair. But-”

“-Do you and Angie confide in each other often?” Lucy cut in. She had produced a bottle of whisky and two crystal glasses. They clinked to the desk as her inquiry hung in the air.

“We all grew up together, hell she was almost like a sister to me.” I replied sheepishly. 

“Huh. You were never envious of Trevor?” She began to pour the whisky. It reeked of cinnamon, strong and spicy. 

“Why would I?” I eyed her. 

“No reason I suppose.” She evaded the question. “Well we have good news and bad news regarding your brother’s case.” She slid one of the crystal glasses towards me.

“What’s the good news?” I jumped at that eagerly. 

“We caught him. Well, more like he turned himself in.” She raised her glass in celebration and I sat there, stunned at the reveal. My heart fluttered at the prospect of the son of a bitch rotting in a cell for the rest of his unnatural life.

So why was I still so nervous?

She didn’t seem fazed by my stunned look and took a swig of her drink. Her face scrunched and she let out a loud whistle.

“Strong stuff.” she muttered to herself. I glanced down at the swill in front of me. That intoxicating odor beckoned me like an old friend. “The perp has an extensive rap sheet. Used to be a triggerman for the Mariani crime family. But it was blowing away that teenager that finally made him grow a conscience." she put bluntly. I winced at the mention of my brother’s sin. 

“The way he tells it, she wasn’t supposed to be there that night.” She said casually as my ears perked up. 

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked as she rolled her eyes.

“Oh please, you watch TV. This case has all the tell-tale signs of a hit gone wrong.” she grimaced. 

“Who’d want to kill Trevor?” I asked rhetorically. Lucy looked at me like I had sprouted another head that was babbling nonsense. She took another swig of the brown concoction in front of her and pursed her full lips. I noticed then she was wearing a wonderful shade of lipstick, scarlet as a blooming rose. 

“Was hoping you’d tell me. You were his keeper after all.”

“I-I just ran his accounts.” I looked away from the stern look her pretty face was giving off. 

“Right so you know where all the money is.” She stated. The silence grew heavy as I failed to respond, I could feel it beating down on me like an overbearing parent. That damn clock was still ticking, every clack a nag on the back of my neck. My skin crawled as the tension boiled over, those hazel eyes seemed to bore into me with surgical precision. 

“I often delegated those tasks. I didn’t think it was right to mix money and family.” I finally thought up. 

“Trevor didn’t seem to have that problem. Seems he was generous enough to “gift” you a lump sum every month or so.” Lucy remarked. I felt my forehead glisten with sweat, my face slowly turning crimson. 

“I-I think I need a lawyer.” I stammered.

“I am a lawyer.” She replied coolly. “You haven’t been accused of anything, frankly I don’t know why you’re so nervous. At the end of the day we got the guy, that’s cause for celebration. We can hammer out the details later.” She pointed her pinky finger at the alluring glass in front of me. I hesitated but then broke out in smiles, still drenched in liquid guilt.

I grabbed the tumbler and took a gulp. The whisky almost came back up as quickly as it lurched down my esophagus, but I choked it down and felt it burn in my chest. She smiled sweetly at me, and I thought I saw a flash of pink sprint through her eyes. I took another swig and it went down easier, but burned just as bright. 

“Thatta boy.” Lucy said, easing herself out of her chair. She walked around the desk and I couldn’t help but notice her swaying hips. She traced her fingers across the desk and I blushed, my vision beginning to fuzz and skip.

She lightly touched my arm and goosebumps sprung from her touch. My face was hotter than the equator, and I looked down, studying the rest of my drink. She caressed my shoulders and I became flustered, and then it hit me like a truck.

*What was I doing right now?* ran across my brain like a steam engine. I tried to get up but she pushed me back down, her hands digging into my blades. 

“Look this-this isn’t why I’m here. What’s-wahtsh happening? I slurred. No, no this wasn’t right. I wasn't this big of a lightweight. Lucy leaned into my ear, her steamy breath driving me wild. 

“Relax now Joey.” She sultrily said. “We’re going on a little trip.”

With that the world around me began to spin, and I felt weightless. Like I was freefalling through a tunnel, just tumbling ever downward towards an infinite doom. Eventually I regained my sense of self and awoke with a splitting headache in an empty office.

It was pitch black and I felt a sense of dread as I realized even the clock had passed on. I could make out vague, shifting shapes of Lucy’s office furniture.

“Hello?” I called out to nothing. Not even bleating traffic outside could be heard. I fumbled around in the dark, grasping at braying shadows that cruelly danced around me. I did eventually find the tin tinted handle of the office door and swung it open to find an all-consuming void of pure zilch.

My brain kept smashing itself against my skull, and at this point I was convinced the lawyer had slipped me a mickey; to what end I hadn’t a clue. I took a timid step forward and my pointed shoe hit the ground with a clunk. I took another step and found my footing and just raced into the ink.

The only sound was my footsteps echoing across the void. Just a constant thudding sling-shoting itself all around me. The only thing around was the lingering smell of berries. It was almost suffocating. I walked for miles somehow in that endless abyss; being strangled by wild berries.

Finally, I came across an eerie mauve glow. It was trapped behind a door. I could hear faint giggling coming behind it. What remained of my battered sense were all telling me not to open that door, but I just couldn’t stop myself. I inched forward, that sinister giggle a siren's call. The handle was like putty in my hand; it wanted to be open.

The door swung open and I was bathed in that glow. I could see a figure beckoning me closer, a woman. Two growths sprouted from her forehead in curled fashion. Wrapped around her thigh was a whip-like tale, the end a spade. Her eyes were hot pink, like the burning embers of lust itself. She had two leathery wings clung around her like a coat. I stepped into the room and the door slammed shut behind me.

Disappeared in fact.

“Joseph.” the woman whispered from afar yet sounded like it was right in my ear canal. “What are you hiding Joey.” The voice crooned. 

“I-I-I-I-” I stammered like a babbling oaf. The demoness laughed at my expense and suddenly she was by my side in a blink. Her complexion was an ashy blue but I could place that smile anywhere. “Lucy.” I said with wide eyes.

“You’re hiding a naughty secret, ain’t ya Joe.” She moaned in my ear. I tried to turn and face her, but she held my head in place with sharpened claws. She dug her pointed nails into my cheeks, I could feel them literally melding into my flesh. I watched as a tainted memory manifested into view. I saw myself sitting at my desk.

Trevor had phoned in another favor. I was to move another twenty grand into the “charity” account. Incidentally, Trevor had just purchased a tesla. I helped him swindle a lot of donors over the years, I mean he was my brother, how could I refuse?

It wasn’t stealing, not really. He was taking an advance on his paycheck. That’s what I told myself, anyway, wasting away long nights cooking the books; making sure no one would look too close on the extra zeros and a “misplaced” decimal point.

This went on for so long that, yes, eventually I did start squirreling away some of it for a rainy day. What was he going to do if he found out, call the cops? *Pfft*. We watched for a while as I embezzled, Lucy seemed mildly impressed.

“How much of that money ended up going to the needy little orphans anyway.” She whistled. 

“Enough.” I said quietly. “Ok I’m a crook. So what, that doesn’t make me a-AGH FUCK.” She dug her hands deeper into my skull; I could feel wiggling appendages peeling back my nerves and playing Ping-Pong with them. Demonic tentacles digging into my brain matter, splitting my mind asunder. All the while the fiery eyed demoness smiled and laughed.

“You stole his money. What else of his did you covet I wonder.” She mused to herself. The scene before us shifted. Suddenly we were in Angie’s kitchen, and my heart busted out of my chest.

She was smoking, looking at her phone as I saw next to her. She was scrolling though a text chain, one filled with misery. She pushed the phone towards me and took a long drag. Her makeup was starting to run down her usually rosy cheeks. 

“Look at this shit. I found it tucked away in his sock drawer." Her voice was filled with disgust and contempt. I remember scrolling through the burner, text after text of heinous messages, and more than a few photos of-well let's just say I saw more of Trevor than I ever wanted to.

I threw the phone to the table, stomach churning at the utter betrayal.

"I'm so done with this; I thought we had turned a corner." She sniffled. I placed a hand on her shoulder, and she held it tenderly.

"I'm so sorry Ang. I can refer you to a good attorney-" I started. But she shook her head.

"I can't leave him. The house is in his name, all the money. He'd fight me every step of the way." She was right of course, Trevor had always had this petty, vindictive streak to him. Probably what made him such an effective politician. He'd drag her through the muck every inch, to hell with his own reputation.

"What can I do, Ang? Just tell me. I'll do anything." I begged. She looked at me with those sweet eyes, the eyes that made my heart flutter ever since we were kids.

"Just hold me, Joe." She said, falling into my arms. I comforted her as she wept, the memory began to fade, and the searing pain resumed.

Lucy was straddling my back; her legs wrapped around me. She was digging her heels into my sides, cutting into my flabby flesh. Her feet began to take root in my innards, wiggly little parasites biting into me. She was elbow deep in my head now, blood trinkled out of my nose, and discarded matter began to ooze out my sclera. I could feel my mind vaporize the deeper she reached, my memories just playthings to her.

It's like she was melting into me, yet I was the one being reduced to a puddle of nothing. She wrapped her leathery wings around me, leaning into my ear. Her breath felt hot on the tips of my lobs, the scent of berries driving me wild.

"What a charming little snippet." She cooed in my ear. Her voice felt serpentine and filled with daggers, her words cut into my skin like arrows. "Awfully chummy with her." She noted.

I couldn't respond, but she knew what I would have denied. Her talons clinched what remained of my gooey mind. It felt like she was finger-blasting my cerebral cortex. In all honesty it's hard to describe what exactly was done to me, even now I feel a piece of her black soul lingering within.

I didn't have to speak, not that I could. My vocal cords had been torn from my neck. They dangled there like frayed piano wire. She could read my shattered thoughts as I desperately pleaded with her. Despite how close she was, how she had practically claimed my soul for herself, I still found myself lying to her.

*Please-I would never-she's a friend I didn't*

The more I denied the more I could feel her squeezing my soul, wringing the life out of me like a wet towel.

"You know what you did. You robbed him blind, and ya fucked his girl." She whispered in my ear, nipping at my neck. She was engulfing me in herself, wrapped around me like a flesh cocoon. I could see another memory began to take form, ripped straight out of me.

*I-It was after she found out, we were alone and had too much to drink-*

"God you're an awful liar." She sneered at me, her words flowing into me like poison. She wrapped the lie around my face and smothered me with it, as the truth unfolded before me.

It was just after their honeymoon.

I had stopped by to drop off their wedding gift. She was exhausted sorting through them all, but she still looked radiant. Her auburn hair was a tangled mess, and there were sweat stains under her arms; but my god she looked beautiful. We did have a glass of white, then another and another, until someone made the suggestion of checking out the master bedroom.

The rest of that evening is a drunken blur of grunts and desire. The misshapen memory that played before us was a reflection of that. Me and Ang were intertwined at the waists, our groins melded to each other in a passion fueled orgy of carnal lust. We rutted on my brother's bed like dogs in heat, tearing at each other's backs. As our tryst came to a crescendo, we formed into one singular glob of humanity; locked together in ecstasy and sin.

Lucy's chittering giggle swam in my ears as I watched the blob finish with itself. The memory began to dissipate, but the immeasurable guilt over making my brother a cuckold remained.

I shouldn't have felt guilty, they were never in love, not really. He saw her as a prize to be won, and she loved the status he brought. It was a marriage of convivence, neither of them was faithful; why should it matter who started it? I was just trying to offer comfort to my dear friend; she was so lonely and I-

My god you really are a yapper. She loved the money and the thrill of *schtupping* her brother-in-law, and you went right alone with it. Stop trying to defend yourself so hard, it's not a good look.

Her commanding voice cut though my rancid thoughts like butter. I could feel her in every particle of me now. My skin was shriveled like a prune, moist with the pheromones she was secreting. Her wavey hair was coiled around my body like withering serpents. Her wings smelt like sulfur, choking me with their toxicity. I was a gurgling mass of flesh that was being suckled by a demon, I didn't know where I began, and her spiked tail ended.

My neck was a minefield of velvet bites; each marked with her scent. The abhorrent stench of wild berries was just as oppressive as the sulfur, if not more so. We were floating together in the scarlet void, she had her way with me as she ransacked my thoughts, looking for the one thing I was still hiding. I could feel her fury grow the deeper she went, all the deceit and fraud I had committed in Trevor's name.

The feeling of having her fill my very soul was both a euphoric high I suspect I will chase to the end of my days, and also a horrid violation that made me want to crawl into a dank pit and crumple to nothing.

She leaned her chin to the back of my skull and curled herself around. Her twisted face came into view, distorted and ever morphing, glitching between the demon and her stern human facade. Her eyes were still an extreme salmon, burning two holes into my skull with deadly precision.

"I'll be honest with you Joe, you make my skin crawl. You're a limp-dicked yes man who went along with every little scheme big bro suggested." Her words slashed my being to ribbons, the only thing holding the simpering chunks that used to by my physical form were her great wings.

*I'm sorry, I'm sorry for everything. But I didn't kill him I swear, I had nothing to do with it.*

I felt her rage build, and the grip of her wings loosen.

"It's like a second nature; you really cannot help yourself. It's almost impressive." She mused. "No one is mourning Trevor. I assure you; his soul is fermenting quite nicely down below." As if on que, I heard the distant screams of the lost and the damned, and loudest of all was Trevor's bellowing cries.

"If it had just been him, you might have gotten away with it. But the girl-" disgust filled her shifting form "-was cruel. She had her whole life stolen from her; it was bad enough that twisted fuck had her wrapped around his putrid finger." Her eyes flashed with fury.

*I didn't know-she wasn't supposed to be there-*

"-STOP LYING!" She boomed, her grip becoming flimsy. " I can see it, tucked away deep in your mind. You conspired with the wife; the plan was to get them both. I just need to know who-ah, there it is." She said suddenly. "A little tear, just right here-" Her right shoulder shifted forward, her hands burrowing through the wrinkles. I felt a jolt as something was stripped from me, like a lash to the cerebellum. She smiled as she peered into the memory of when I plotted to have him killed.

*No. That's not true, it wasn't her idea, it was mine. I was jealous, I wanted him out of the picture so we could be together.*

I tried to dissuade the demon's discovery, a beyond fruitless endeavor. She regarded me with scornful pity as she retreated from the remains of my spirit. As I felt her withdraw, and the wings gave way and I tumbled to a brimstone filled lake of fire, I heard her voice one final time.

"Spinless to the end, I expected nothing less."

With that the void gave way to a screeching pit of the damned, and the raging fires of hate consumed me, washing over me in spiteful waves. I drowned in a pit of my sins, being torn apart and reshaped a thousand times, each death lasting longer than the last. Eventually I stopped feeling all together, yet the suffering persisted.

This eternal torment seemed to last forever, but soon enough, in my vain attempt to blink the monotony of damnation away; reality flash banged into view, and I found myself once again sitting in Lucy's office, surrounded by police officers looking down on me.

The whiplash of being safe and sound yet having the vivid memory of being blended into puree was shocking to say the least. I began screaming like a rabid lunatic, thrashing about in my seat as two burly cops pushed me back down and smacked me aside the head.

Across from me Lucy sat, still in her suit from before, her hazel eyes looking like a predator in the jungle. I rubbed the back of my head; it ached from the cop's slap. My chest lumbered and ached, my heart felt like it was about to explode. My eyes darted around the room, before finally landing on a piece of paper in front of me.

"Joseph. Are you still with us?" Lucy asked, pursing her lips. One of the cops behind me snickered, another muttered something about "trying for an insanity plea." My head bobbled on my shoulders, like it wasn't screwed on right. Lucy leaned forward and snapped her finger as she tried to break through the fog.

"Joseph, focus up now. I know you've had a long night, but we're almost done." She said sweetly, though venom dripped through every syllable.

"What's happening?" I mumbled. I glanced at the paper in front of me, befuddled by its contents. "Plea deal, I don't under-?"

"You're our king for a day." She grimaced. "You've been sat there spilling the beans on a linty of dirty deeds for hours now, wrote down every little squirmy detail." She tapped a finger on the heading. "Just need your John Handcock right there, and these gentlemen will book you for PC." Her gaze flicked to the cops huddled around me.

"But-I had a drink, you were a monster, I died, over and over again." I was starting to spiral; the room quietly exploded in annoyed mumbles as I did.

"Listen to me Joe." Lucy commanded. "It's over. You're going to do you bid for fraud and testify against Angela for conspiracy to commit murder. The whole hit was her idea; you admitted it in front of myself and several police officers. Going back on it now won't work, I assure you-" her eyes flashed hot pink for a split second. "-It'll be admissible no matter what." I cradled my head in my hands, cringing at how I had betrayed Ange.

"It isn't right, I tried to talk her out of it but. . .Trevor was scum, the world is better off." I blubbered at her. Lucy gave a curt nod.

"On that we agree. But that doesn't excuse murder. Especially one as sloppy as this." I was silent at her response. I saw no way out of it, but to sign the paper. I was led away, read my rights, the whole nine yards.

Things are a blur after that; the trial came and went, I was demonized in the media for the money I laundered, and Angela came out as a rather conflicting figure.

Some said it had been the only way out, while others vilified her for the girl's death. No one mourned Trevor, he might have well as been buried in a Potter's Field the attendance was so scarce for his funeral.

I did my time, reduced sentence for my cooperation. No one was waiting for me when I left the jailhouse steps.

I tried reaching out to Angela but was barred at every turn. I don't blame her; I had shattered her trust when I fingered her in court.

The demoness sent me a letter when I got out. She wished me well and reminded me to stay out of trouble. She said if I ever needed a good lawyer, I knew just who to call.

I still smell of wild berries, that scent forever marking my spirit. Letting me know the creature is always watching, just waiting for me to slip up.
