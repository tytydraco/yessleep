I never liked the house my parents bought when I was a teenager. It was a tall, narrow building sandwiched between a bakery and an abandoned pharmacy. The landlord had told us the previous tenant left in a hurry, leaving behind most of his furniture and a strange, metallic smell that lingered in the hallway.

My father assigned me the bedroom on the top floor, but I spent most of my time in the library or at a local park, trying to stay away from that building. There was a heaviness to the air there, like the house was holding its breath.

One evening, while my mother was cooking in the kitchen and my younger brother was playing with his toys in the living room, I noticed a small wooden door behind the washing machine in the basement. It didn’t have a handle, just a small circular hole where a lock used to be.

I asked my father about it, but he just shrugged, saying the surveyor hadn't mentioned any extra rooms. Being a curious student, I waited until my family was asleep. I took a flashlight and a screwdriver from the garage and headed downstairs.

The basement was freezing. I pushed the screwdriver into the hole and felt a click. The door didn't swing open; it slid sideways into the wall. Behind it was a flight of stone stairs leading down into a space that shouldn't have existed. According to the architecture of the street, this area should have been the foundation of the bakery next door.

I descended into a small, windowless room. It was painted entirely in a flat, matte grey. There was no furniture, except for a single wooden chair facing the far wall. On that wall, someone had pinned dozens of photographs.

I leaned in, my heart hammering against my ribs. The photos weren't of strangers. They were photos of us. There was my sister walking to the bus stop. My mother at the grocery store. My neighbor hanging laundry on the balcony. And there were hundreds of me—sitting in the café, reading in the library, even sleeping in my bedroom.

The terrifying part wasn't just the stalking. It was the perspective. In every photo of me in my bedroom, the camera angle was from the ceiling, looking straight down.

I heard the door behind me slide shut.

I whirled around, but there was no handle on this side. I was trapped in the grey room. I started screaming for my father, banging my fists against the wood, but the walls seemed to soak up the sound. The grey paint felt soft, almost like skin.

I sat on the chair, the only object in the room, and noticed a small notebook tucked under the seat. I opened it. It was a diary written by the previous tenant.

"The house is a mirror," the first page read. "It doesn't just hold people; it copies them. But the copies are never perfect. They lack the warmth. They lack the soul. I’ve been down here for three months. I can hear the other 'me' upstairs, talking to my wife. She hasn't noticed the difference yet. He sounds just like me, but he never blinks."

I dropped the notebook. Above me, I heard footsteps. They were heavy, rhythmic, and they were coming from my bedroom on the top floor. Then, I heard a voice. It was my voice.

"Mom? Dad? I'm going for a walk to the park," the voice shouted.

I heard my mother respond from the kitchen, "Okay, honey! Be home by dinner!"

I screamed until my throat was raw, but the "me" upstairs just kept talking. I heard the front door slam shut. Silence followed. I sat in that grey room for what felt like hours, staring at the photos of a life that was being lived by something else.

Then, the ceiling of the grey room began to ripple. A small slit opened in the plaster, and a camera lens poked through, clicking softly as it took a picture of me sitting on the chair.

A few minutes later, the side door slid open. My brother was standing there. But his eyes were like black glass, and his skin had a slight grey tint. He didn't say a word. He just handed me a tray of food and a fresh set of clothes.

"The visitor is happy with your performance today," the boy said. His voice sounded like a recording played at the wrong speed. "You are much better at being the 'shadow' than the last one."

He closed the door again. That was five years ago. I am still in the grey room. I watch my family through the lenses in the ceiling. I watch the "me" upstairs grow older, graduate from college, and get a job at a bank.

Sometimes, when the "me" upstairs looks into a mirror in the bathroom, he lingers for a second. He stares straight into his own eyes, and for a brief moment, I see a flash of grey in his pupils. He knows I'm here. He's making sure I'm still sitting on the chair.

Because if I ever leave this room, he’ll have nowhere to hide. And the house hates an empty shadow.
