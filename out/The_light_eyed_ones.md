*Beware the light eyed ones!*


That's what  my grandma had always said to my mom,aunts and uncles and eventually to her grand kids and great grandchildren.


My grandfather always thought it was strange as well buy he died years before I was born,in a car crash.


My mother had told me that her mom had proudly told her and her siblings that she made sure they all had brown eyes once they were born, and even did the same to myself, all of my cousins, my younger brother,and my 3 younger sencond cousins


Apparently my grandma practically had to fight with the doctors a few times while trying to get to a few of us to make sure our eyes were brown or hazel.



Every one of us do,in fact have shades of brown eyes.From very dark brown, to medium, to light brown, to amber, to hazel eyes with a little green flecks.


She also threatened to disown one of her sons when he dated a green eyed girl when he was a teenager.She demanded that they all only dated people with brown eyes.Hazel with green flecks was the only exception to her.


She also told her kids that any friends they brought over were to have brown eyes as well
.She always made sure us grandkids did the same.


Anytime she came across someone with blue,green or gray eyes,she would get a terrified look on her face and get away from them as fast as possible


She would never even go out to family restaurants unless she knew the waiter or waitress had dark eyes







No one ever truly knew why and whenever she was asked,she would just say the sane phrase every single time.


*Beware the light eyed ones*




That is, until I went to visit her on her death bed a few days ago.Multiple family members had come and gone to say their good byes to her already.


She was 86 when she passed.Looking at her frail body and pale skin while she laid on that bed  brought tears to my eyes.

Besides her weird obsession with people having brown eyes and avoiding those who didn't like they were a disease,she was a great woman  .


She always had fun stuff for us grandkids to do when we visited her and was otherwise delightful


She had not a single  racist or homophobic bone in her body.She just had something against light eyed people.



When I sat down beside her,she grabbed my hand as tight as she could and told me how much she loved me and that she had to tell me something that she couldn't even tell her husband,friends or even her own kids


I was surprised by this and happily agreed to listen to her get whatever she held back for so long off of her chest to me....but after listening to her story,I am terrified

Here is what she said to me before dying 2 says later



*As you know,I have never been fond of non-brown eyed people in my life.I know its been a mystery to so many of you for years now.And now that I am on my way out,I am finally able to be at peace knowing they can never get me.*


*When I was little ,almost everyone I knew had dark eyes in the town I lived in.There were a few that I knew who had light eyes but they were rare*


*One day on my way to school when I was in 3rd grade,a young man and  woman were just standing in my path,smiling down at me.They both looked to be around 25 to me *


*They both had very beautiful light eyes.The man had eyes as green as emeralds and the woman had eyes the color of a blue sky mixed with silvery gray.I smiled at them as I attempted to walk around them as I knew to not make small talk with strangers...yes we were taught that even back in those days*

*But as I tried to walk around them,I felt hands grab me from behind as I was then thrown to the ground.Before I could even scream,I was put into a choke hold by the man as the woman stared down from above me...those smiles still plastered to their faces and their lifeless light eyes staring down at me as the world faded to black around me*

*When I came to,I found myself tied to a tree and gagged, in front of the lake in my town, where I learned to swim.As if on que,the man and woman emerged from some other nearby trees and 4 more people followed behind them*


*They all stood in front of me with blank expressions on their faces and they didn't blink.I noticed something that they all had in coomon.They all had light eyes.The first man had green,the woman had grayish blue,another man had plain gray,another woman had baby blue,another man had greenish blue and the last woman had dark blue eyes*


*After a few moments the man who choked me out stepped foward and bend down so his eyes were in front of mine.He then pulled out a silver spoon from his pocket, and told me that I needed to get my new pretty eyes so they could have a child in the new world that he is starting*


*I still remember the fear I felt as he brought up the spoon inches from my left eye as the other 5 people simply smiled and watched.But just before the spoon touched my eye,I heard a gun shot.The man stopped,dropped the spoon and fell down to his side...dead*


*The other 5 people tried to run off but more gunshots rang out and  they too all dropped one by one.Several hunters were out that day hunting duck and  came across what those freaks were doing and knew they had to take action and began firing from a short distance*


*They ran out from their hiding spots and untied me and settled me down as much as my hysteric self could be.I was reunited with my parents and siblings later that day as we all cried together.My mom said she would never let me be again*



*One woman who was shot survived, and after being interrigated for hours,she admitted that they were a small group called the Light eyed ones.They wanted every person in the world to have non- brown eyes.And they would do anything to make that happen.They had stalked me for weeks and planned to kidnap me,take out my eyes and put in glass eyes with blue irisis to make me perfect*



*She was sent to a lonely house after she was deemed insane by doctors where I think she spent the rest of her days as far as I know*


*But not long after that happened as I was returning to normal life as best as I couuld,I found a note on my dresser one day that said the other light eyed ones are still around and would grow in numbers and would make me join them soon*


*I never told anyone and threw it away as I didn't want my parents to know and I was still just a little girl who didn't want them to freak out again.I was homeschooled after that day as I feared a light eyed one would appear in my school and kidnap me while the other kids watched in horror*


*That is why I've never trusted them....any of those damn light eyed ones.I have been on alert for many decades....years of nightmares them staring down at me with those cold light eyes....years of fear and paranoia.But at least it will be over soon*



I was so shocked by her confession but I held back and so my hugged her as she began to sob after she finished her story.


As I left later that day,I came across a blue eyed nurse who smiled at me ...and I felt fear...and as I hurried past her I swear she mumbled under her breath


*You will join the light eyed ones  one day*
