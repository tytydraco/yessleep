*TW:* \>!*Death, Grief*!<



There’s an abandoned skyscraper outside my city, so tall you can't see the top. But it’s not always there. Normally, it's an empty lot between 4 buildings that form the abandoned industrial area of the city. However, at predetermined intervals, there's a skyscraper in its spot. And you should never, *never* go inside. Most people don't even know it exists. It is also the center of a not so well known urban legend. A legend my friends and I pursued, and it changed our lives forever.



The first time I noticed it was just a passing glance. I was 7 years old, on a car ride home from something with my dad. He let me sit shotgun in the truck, even though I wasn't nearly tall enough yet. We took a backroad home since the highway traffic made him mad. I knew the route fairly well, the same way home we used coming from Church and my grandparents’ house. So when I looked out expecting to see the gravel lot surrounded by empty paper mills and warehouses, I was shocked to see something there. 



The tower was huge. The biggest building I'd ever seen. It reached into the clouds and well beyond (at least that's how it felt; the top was obscured by the gray overcast). It looked to be some sort of office space, or it was at one point. Broken windows revealed empty cubicles and deserted personal offices. 



“Wow…” I said, amazed I hadn't noticed the building before. It must've caught my dad’s attention because he slowed down ever so slightly, cruising past the building. The lot was on the north side of the road, with seemingly no access point. A chain link fence (I had also never noticed) wrapped all the way around, leaving no visible entry, no gate or gap in the fence. 



“Huh. Never noticed that.” My dad muttered as we rolled past, accelerating back to speed. “Coulda sworn that lot was empty just yesterday.”



“It was!” I exclaimed, probably louder than necessary. “How’d it get there so fast? And what happened to it? It looks messed up.”



“I don't know about that, bud. I think we might be mixing it up with another spot.” I tried to read my dad’s face. He seemed as confused as I was, but his words were as smooth and confident as always. “Y’know, the brain is a crazy thing. You can convince yourself something happened, or something was somewhere else, just by believing it hard enough. There's a thing called ‘The Placebo Effect’ that…”



My dad loved trivia and would jump on any chance to share his encyclopedia of random information. There was no telling when a conversation would turn into a lesson on history, or science, or theology. When I was younger, I was convinced my dad knew everything there was to know. Now that I'm older, I'd say that was only a slight exaggeration. I wish I would've listened more.



When we got home, I immediately told Mom about the skyscraper. 



“It was so big, it was above the clouds! You couldn't see the top, it went on forever!”



“It was pretty big.” Dad jumped in. “Can't believe we hadn't noticed it before. But yanno, the brain is a crazy thing.” He began. 



“Yeah, Placebo Effect and all.” My Mom cut him short with a sly smile and a roll of her eyes. If I had heard the same “fun fact” 10 times, Mom had heard it 1,000 times. They were high school sweethearts who stayed madly in love (much to my embarrassment in front of friends). “That is interesting, I’ll have to keep an eye out for it next time I'm headed that way.”



That was the last time I even thought about the skyscraper for a long time. Because only a few days later, my entire world was brought to a screeching halt. 

  


The last few weeks of school before summer break are (I believe we can all agree) the slowest, most boring, soul-draining days. It became mostly busywork to keep us occupied since state testing had finished. While staring at an activity packet full of word searches, basic math puzzles, and sentences for grammar correction, I found myself wishing I could do anything else. The voice over the PA made me regret that wish for the rest of my life.



“Mark Lawson, to the main office. Mark Lawson, to the main office.”



A choir of “oooh”’s and a few “you're in trouble\~”’s from classmates accompanied my anxious walk out the door. I wasn’t a straight-A student, but I wasn't a troublemaker either. I mostly flew under the radar of teachers and administration, just another unremarkable kid. Every step towards the office felt like I was marching to the gallows for a crime I was not aware I committed. My heart felt like it was beating behind my eyes. It felt impossibly fast, like a kick drum in a death metal song. This feeling only intensified with the jingling of keys turning the corner. The heavyset administrator, Ms. Lewis, met my gaze. Usually, the makeup-caked wrinkles of her face formed a scowl at any youth unfortunate enough to be caught in the hallways during class time. However, her expression shifted my entire perspective. My heart went from beating like a drum line to sinking into my stomach. 



The woman who had never had a kind word for anyone had a genuine look of pity, sadness, empathy for another human…for me. She adjusted her glasses and wiped at her eyes as if she was on the verge of tears. “Hello Mr. Lawson. We-uhm. You need to go to the office. Now.” She sounded like she was about to break down. 



I don't know how I knew. Maybe I didn't, and hindsight has made me biased. But for some reason, I ran. I bolted towards the glass door of the office, faster than I had ever run. Something happened, something bad happened. Something to Dad. I could feel it in my soul. It was like the look on Ms. Lewis’s face made me aware that part of my life was just ripped from me. I burst through the doors. The front desk staff’s heads turned to me. I hadn't realized when I started to cry, sometime during the run apparently. 



As they both rushed from behind the desk, the Principal walked out. He was a tall, imposing young man, late 20’s or early 30’s at the oldest. His blonde hair was slicked back, and always he wore a blue button-up tucked into black slacks. He held a hand up to signal the women to stop, approaching the frantic mess of snot and tears that was 7-year-old me. 



“Mark. Deep breaths. Did someone tell you?” He asked, his voice calm and collected. His expression was soft, almost soothing. It helped me collect myself to speak, wiping my tears and snot away with a tissue he offered. 



“N-no.” I said through shudders and I fought back another hysterical burst of tears. “B-but Ms. Lewis looked so sad and I've never seen her like that and she said I needed to come here so I ran and-”



“Hey, hey. Slow down. Okay.” Principal Harbaum said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “Your mom is on the way.”



That was the only confirmation I needed. My mom worked a very demanding accounting job, she was the breadwinner. My dad was a delivery driver for a local logistics company. He delivered parts for cars and stuff around the city. He was always the one to pick me up from school for doctor’s appointments and the like. Mom could never get away from work long enough. Something happened to Dad.



I broke. I fell to my knees and sobbed. I cried so hard I felt like my throat was bleeding. My chest felt heavy and my lungs were on fire. The world was a blurry mess around me. Everything sounded muffled and confusing. I thought I was going to pass out.



What was probably only minutes felt like hours. I cried myself into exhaustion. I sat on the floor, side pressed up against the office desk, breathing slow and deep, shuddering occasionally as more tears flowed. When my mom showed up, she took one look at me and covered her mouth, sobbing softly for a moment before clearing her throat.



“Mark, let's go. I'll tell you outside.” She said, holding a hand out to me. 



I stood up and clung to her. She held me for a moment and let me sob softly into her dress. I felt her arms wrap as tight as they could around me. Her chest seized occasionally as she fought her own fit of tears. We stood in a silent embrace in that office until I felt like I could walk again. When we stepped outside, I braced myself for the confirmation of my deductions.



“Mark…your father was…” she breathed deep, looking me in the eyes. She always said I had my dad’s eyes. I couldn't imagine the pain she felt in that moment. The strength it must've taken to hold back screaming, crying, cursing God and begging. “Your father is…dead.” She waited for my reaction before continuing. “There was a drive-by downtown and he was caught in the crossfire.” She choked out, fighting her own sobs once more.



Shock. That was the only thing I felt, initially. My dad, the most upstanding man I knew. My dad, who carried bugs out of our house on napkins and set them free. My dad, who taught me that the best thing you can do for the world is be kind and loving to a stranger. My dad was shot to death in his car. My dad was killed by a gang member. That couldn't be right. My dad wasn't in a gang! My dad stayed away from criminals, from drugs, he never even drank! He quit cigarettes cold turkey the day I was born. He donated 10% of his weekly income to the local soup kitchen, and convinced my mother to do the same. He wasn't a bad person, why would a gang member shoot him? 



“Mark?” Mom’s voice broke me out of my trance.



“...I. Uh.” I shuddered. “What…what do we do?” 



“Right now? We go home.” She said, taking my hand and walking us to the car. The car ride was silent, aside from the radio turned almost all the way down. So was the walk to the kitchen. We both sat at the kitchen table in silence for a moment. 



“...Will I get to see him …” I struggled for the words.



“Yes.” She assured me. “You will, I promise. Just, not right now.”



I wanted to ask why, but I also had an idea. If the shooting was bad, it would've been traumatic to see him. She has my best interests in mind. Still, it didn't stop the disappointment. My dad was dead, and I wouldn't be able to see him for the last time until God knows when.



The rest of the day was spent comforting one another, looking at pictures, crying, laughing, crying more. Around 6pm, the phone rang. 



“Hello?” My mom said after picking up the phone off the wall. “Yes, this is her. Oh, hello…thank you, that's very kind of you to call. Oh!” Her voice perked up for a moment. She looked at me. “I can ask for him, certainly, one second. Mark, it's Quincy's dad. He said Quincy wanted to talk to you. Do you wanna…?”



I thought for a moment. Quincy had been my best friend since Pre-K. My Dad had become close with his Dad as well. Part of me didn't want to talk to anyone at that moment, but a stronger part of me needed some sort of normalcy, some familiar comfort. I walked over and took the phone. 



“Hello? It's Mark.”



“Mark!” Quincy’s voice was raspy but still upbeat. It sounded like he had been crying, but was putting up a front for me. I felt tears well in my eyes but fought them back. 



“Hey…” I said through a forced smile. 



“I’m so sorry. How are you?” Quincy asked, maintaining his ever-upbeat tone.



“I'm…I don't know.. I'm okay, I think, but” I sighed. “It doesn't feel good.”



“Yeah….” There was a pause before he continued. “Uhm, my dad wanted me to tell you and your mom that if you need anything, call us. If you wanna come over, just let me know! You can spend the night whenever you want this summer.” 



“Thanks, Quincy.” Even though in the moment it didn't help much, Quincy’s persistent positive attitude and constant support was one of the only things that kept me going that summer. 



The rest of the night was quiet. I played Paper Mario on my GameCube and Mom brought me some pizza bagels and a mountain dew (I wasn't allowed to have soda after 5pm but this was an obvious exception). She didn't check on me for bedtime. I figured I wasn't going to school for a while anyways, so I could stay up.



It was also hard to sleep. When I finally felt tiredness creep over me, I crawled into bed and stared at the ceiling for God knows how long. I thought about all the time spent with Dad. The time I wouldn't get to have. I thought about Mom, about how much worse she must feel. About how much harder things would be for her as a single mother. I’d hoped these thoughts wouldn't linger.

  


Three-and-a-half years later, they still bore down on me. Probably worse than before. My mom did well enough to keep us fed, clothed, and sheltered. The year following my Dad’s passing, she had to sell the house and downsize from a two-story, 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom, to a single-story, 2 bed, 1 bath, a little closer to her work. I started walking to school with a new friend I had met through Quincy, named Tre, who lived in the same neighborhood. Where Quincy was full of positive energy and drive, Tre was much more laid back and “go with the flow”. I liked to believe I was the middle ground, not too laid back but not too energetic (when in reality I was probably more a horrid combination of both). We worked well as a group.



During those three years, I had forgotten about the skyscraper almost entirely. My new route to school had me walking by the empty lot without a second thought every day. So naturally, when the tower reappeared on our walk home, I was awestruck. 



It was a Friday and Quincy had joined us for the walk home. We were headed to Tre’s house for a sleepover. As we grew closer to the abandoned industrial sites, something called back memories of my Dad. I found myself reminiscing over our old memories, tuned out of the conversation the other two were having. 



“Woah, when did *that* get *there?*” Tre asked, pointing to the lot. Where gravel normally lay undisturbed, there it was. Massive, reaching up into the overcast sky, beyond the clouds. A chain link fence surrounded the perimeter, spaced about 15ft away from the building. No access road, and there didn't even seem to be a parking lot. 



“Woah, what? I've never seen that. Mark?” Quincy looked to me. 



The memory flooded back. I pressed my palm to my forehead as I tried to recall. “Dude! How did I forget? I saw this here once before! With Dad!” They paused at the mention of his name. It was sometimes a sore spot, but right now my bewilderment outweighed any lingering grief. “He said I was just remembering it wrong, but I was *sure* it wasn't here before. What the heck?”



“Ghost building! Ooooo!” Quincy raised his arms and twiddled his fingers.



“Okay but really. How did this just pop up?” Tre said, crossing his arms. He blew his long bangs from his face. “And why would you build a pre-abandoned building?”



“You wouldn't, duh!” Quincy jumped in front of him. “But if it's a *ghost building* it would look abandoned, cause it's the dead soul of the building!”



“Buildings don't have souls. Only humans do.” I said, calling on my Sunday school teachings. “Plus, even if ghosts are real, which they're not,” I said in an admittedly uptight tone. “Why would there be a ghost building?”



“Okay, Pastor Lawson.” Tre rolled his eyes. “I mean, there's no chance they just built this, right? It has to have been here for a long time. My dad does construction, and building houses *way* smaller than this still takes a long, long time.”



“Who knows?” I shrugged before turning to continue. “I guess we just double check tomorrow?” 



We agreed to make an excuse to sneak away the next day and investigate. Most of the night was spent coming up with theories explaining the skyscraper’s existence. Tre tried to stay “realistic” (for a 10-year-old), saying it was a fake building made of paper mache that's a front for an underground drug ring. Quincy was dead set that it was a “ghost tower”. I talked about the Placid Bow effect (I probably butchered the explanation as bad as the name) and tried to argue it was always there. They laughed, I laughed, and conversation topics eventually changed to who would win in a fight between Naruto (Pre-Chunin exams because this was 2007) and Ash with Pikachu and Charizard. Naruto won, but I was still defiantly team Pokemon. 



Tre fell asleep in his bed, Quincy and I in sleeping bags on the floor. That night, I dreamt about Dad. I dreamt we were at the kitchen table having cereal, and he asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. 



“I wanna be like you, Dad!” I said excitedly.



“No you don't, I'm dead.” My dad said with a smile. Suddenly, I was staring at him in the open casket. He looked like he was asleep. I grabbed his cold hand and began to sob. My mom patted my back and spoke soft comforts. Then, my dad spoke from the casket, eyes still shut. His voice was hoarse and strained. 



“The. Tower. I'm. There. Remember. And. Seek. And. Find.”



I woke up in a cold sweat. 4:44 AM blinked in red text on the alarm clock. I looked to my friends. Quincy was asleep in his sleeping bag. Tre wasn't in his bed, however. 



“Tre…?” I asked softly. No response. I heard footsteps in the hall outside the bedroom door. Moving into the hall slowly, I saw a light on. The bathroom door was open, and I could faintly see a small shadow. “Tre?” I asked again. 



Tre poked his head around the corner. I sighed in relief. “Sorry, I had a nightmare and didn't see you.”



“I had a nightmare too. About your dad.”



My face dropped. My heart sank. “W-what happened?”



“I was at the funeral, and your dad was talking in the casket.”



“What did he say to you?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.



Tre shrugged. “I couldn't understand him. It was loud. Like he was screaming from the casket. You were scared and confused and so was your mom. And then I woke up.”



We stood in silence for a while before I told him about my dream. More silence. 



“The tower?” Tre asked, crossing his arms. “You don't think-”



“The skyscraper, yeah.” I said. “We need to check it out tomorrow.”



“Yeah…” he said, though he sounded unsure. It was odd, seeing him unsettled. He was the toughest 11-year-old I knew. Still, he assured me he was fine and we went back to his room, falling asleep with some difficulty, occasionally shooting scared glances at one another, afraid of another nightmare.



The next morning, Tre asked Quincy if he had any weird dreams.



“Yeah, I had a dream I was riding on a horse, but I was naked, and-”



“Okay, not that.” Tre interrupted with a slightly disgusted tone. “Mark and I both had dreams about his…dad.”



“And he talked about a ‘Tower’ in mine.” I interjected.



“...the ghost building?” Quincy’s eyes widened. 



“I think so.” I replied, rubbing leftover sleep from my eyes. “We should check it out today.”



Pancakes were served by Tre’s Dad’s at-the-time Girlfriend (who was young enough to be Tre’s older sister, but to us, she was a grown up like the rest of them). Tre’s dad had already left for work. We ate, then took turns showering and getting into our clothes for the day. Then, we made our plan. We decided our excuse would be meeting another friend to hang out at the local park. The lot was only a slight detour from the park, so at any point if we got caught, we had an alibi. Simple enough, but when you're a kid this level of planning feels like the equivalent to a jewel heist, despite really only having 1 step. 



The single step plan worked like a charm, probably because the early 20’s young woman didn't want to watch three prepubescent boys all day. We left the house with backpacks full of snacks and capri-suns. The park was a roughly mile-and-a-half walk, and the small industrial area was a little over three quarters into the trip. It took 20 minutes to reach the top of the upward sloped road, leading to the sort of “valley” in between two hills where the industrial area rested. As soon as we crested the hill, we realized something was wrong. 



By that point, the tower definitely should've been visible. The sense of urgency seemed to strike us all at once, and we rushed down the sidewalk that descended the hill, towards the impossibly empty lot. As we got closer, two sights surprised us all. The first, and most shocking, was the empty lot where the building *definitely* was the previous day. 



The second was a curly-haired blonde girl, roughly our age, standing on the sidewalk and staring into the empty lot. As we got closer her attention turned to us. Rosy cheeks and bright green eyes brought three boys to a stop. I had never seen her around, and something about her seemed to stun all three of us. As our approach halted, her voice snapped us to attention.



“You saw it too, right?” Her voice seemed eager, her eyes lit up with wonder and excitement. 



None of us spoke for a moment. I managed to get a single syllable of “what” out, more of a “wah” under my breath, before Tre composed himself enough to speak for us.



“The skyscraper, right? Yeah, we saw it yesterday.”



“Me too! Walking home from practice, it was there! I never saw it before and now it's just *gone!* What the hell!?”



The swear brought me to attention. I examined the girl with a more clear, less awestruck lens. Clean black jeans with holes in the knees (clearly cut with a pair of scissors), a plaid patterned flannel over a black shirt that was adorned with colored plastic gemstones in a rose design, and Converse shoes. She looked like Shirley Temple cosplaying Avril Lavigne.



“Yeah, it's weird!” Quincy’s voice brought me out of my probably rather awkward stare. “Mark says he saw it when he was little.”



“Y-yeah.” I said, forcing the lump in my throat to pass so I could speak. “Well, I wasn’t little. It was with my dad, like, 3 years ago. Right before he…passed.”



“Oh…” her voice softened and expression shifted accordingly. “I'm sorry to hear that, uhm…Mark.” She said, almost more of a question.



“Yeah, Mark. And this is Quincy and Tre.” They nodded as I spoke. 



“I'm Mel.” She said, the smile returning to her face. “Well, Melissa, but Mel for short “



“Oh! You're the new girl in Mr. Aldrin’s class!” Quincy said, as if having a eureka moment. “I thought I recognized you, you're in my cousin’s class, Audrey Baymen.”



“Oh, yeah! She’s really quiet.” Mel remarked before turning her attention back to the lot. “So…so why isn't it here? Or why *was* it here?”



“We don't really know.” I said with a shrug. “We came back because…” there was a pause. I looked to Tre, who nodded. “...Tre and I had weird dreams. About my dad. And in my dream, my dad mentioned I could find him…in a tower.”



Mel stepped closer immediately, her eyes wide. “Wait, really? You're joking, right?” The look on my face must've answered her question because she continued. “That's crazy! Like, really, really crazy! Like, horror movie crazy!”



“Yeah, but it's not there.” Tre said rather bluntly, his arms crossed. “So we can't do much.”



“Well, you've seen it twice. What happened the first time?” She asked, the excitement never leaving her voice.



“Uhm. I was in my dad’s truck, we passed by, both saw it and then…that's it.” I said, trying to recall the day. “Nothing really happened that day…” Memories of my father came back, and I had to secure myself in the moment. 



“So we need to figure out what makes it appear…” Mel’s excitement turned to curiosity, tapping her chin in an exaggerated display of intense thought.



“*We*?” Tre tilted his head. “We just met you, you're kind of inviting yourself in. This is important to Mark. I mean, we were invited. You just were here when we got here.”



“Oh come *on*, dude.” Mel moved closer to Tre, who took a seemingly instinctive step back. “This isn't some boys-only game that you guys made up, this is a real life *mystery!* That's like, the coolest thing to happen to anyone! Plus, I saw the building too! I want in, it sounds exciting.”



We shared a look between each other. Even with our initial reactions to seeing the girl, letting her join would undermine the manliness of the group (from the perspective of 10-year-olds who still believed in the abstract concept of “cooties”). Still, it was obvious we all had mixed feelings about it. Whether it was young infatuation, a genuine attempt at breaking the gender boundaries, or just the solidarity of numbers, we came to a silent agreement. 



“Okay, you can come along.” I said, watching excitement return to her face.



“But!” Tre cut off her exclamation. “No stupid girly crap, got it?”



“Okay, tough guy.” She punched him on the shoulder. “I don't like that shit anyways.”



The look of shock on our faces at the swear brought an eruption of almost musical laughter from the girl. We diverted plans to actually spend time at the park, to cover the alibi and become acquainted with our new companion. Soon, that musical laughter joined our own as we joked, played made-up games, and argued about Pokemon (she was a die-hard Dialga supporter, evening out our previously Palkia-dominated Pokemon debates). Mel meshed well into the group and by the end of the day, we were making plans to meet again and discuss the tower. 



And we would, but not as soon as we planned.



Over the next three days, Mel became an essential part of the friend group. We waited at the park after school for her to finish soccer practice, hung out until near dark, and walked most of the way home together since Quincy and Mel lived in the same suburb. Tre and I continued the walks alone. The second day of including Mel in the group, I brought up how cool she was “for a girl”.



“Nah, she's just cool.” Tre remarked back. “Like, she actually knows about cool stuff. And she can take a joke. Actually, she makes better jokes than Quincy sometimes.”



“Well why don't you marry her?” I jeered with a slight nudge of my elbow into his side. 



“Nah, she’s too much like us. I like a girl like…Harley.”



“Harley? Harley Koffner?” I stopped, shocked at his confession. Harley was a cute red-haired girl with thick glasses and an obsession with Justin Timberlake. She wasn't exactly what I imagined Tre pursuing. 



“Yeah. She's cute, and I like her glasses.” He shrugged. “What about you?”



I didn't answer immediately. I tried to think of anyone I would be interested in, but no one came to mind. Mel, maybe, but I just met her and she was already too close of a friend. Like Tre said, we had too much in common.



“I don't like any of the girls at school.” I admitted. “I used to like a girl named Evelyn at church, but Mom and I haven't gone in like, a year.”



“Yeah, that's fair.” He replied, and the conversation dropped.



I thought about that conversation for longer than I'd like to admit. I couldn't really picture myself dating, let alone dating a girl I knew. The girls I knew were lame, gross, and boring. Mel didn't count, she was slowly being assigned the honorary title of “dude”. Still, maybe it was just my growing mind and body, but there was a faint yearning for a relationship, even if I didn't fully understand what that entailed. All of that was put on halt the next day.



Mel wasn't at school. Our recess times lined up to share that last 20 minutes with her class. We had met under the big oak tree towards the back of the schoolyard previously, but she didn't show. Quincy tracked down his cousin Audrey to ask her.



“Oh, you didn't hear…” Her face went slightly pale. “Mel’s mom was in an accident last night. She died.”



Our group fell silent. I felt all the blood drain from my face. I heard Quincy shudder out a “what?” under his breath. Tre was very interested in the ground. I couldn't break from Adurey’s saddened stare.



“Are…are you sure?” I hesitantly uttered.



“Well, I heard it was a car crash from someone else, but Mr. Aldrin told the class Mel’s mom passed and she wouldn't be here for a bit, and that we were working on a card for her and her grandma. Jamie told me it was a car accident. Reese said it was a drunk driver, and someone else said she was drunk, but that's just a rumor.”



I didn't hear anything after the confirmation that the info came from a teacher. That was proof enough that something bad happened.



“Why? Were you guys friends?” The question broke my trance.



“Yeah…we just started hanging out a few days ago.” Tre answered for us.



“Oh…I'll get the teacher. I'm sorry.” At first, I didn't realize what she was talking about. Then I felt the tear run down my cheek. I looked at my friends. Tre was staring at the ground but shivered occasionally as he fought sobs. Quincy was wiping his eyes with his sleeves. 



The recess monitor was told of our situation, which made its way to Principal Harbaum apparently, because shortly after recess our group was called to the office. Mr. Harbaum asked about our relationship with Mel, then asked if we had heard the news. When we confirmed, he said that we should take the rest of the day off and maybe call our friend. He contacted our parents, let them know the situation, and one by one we were picked up and taken home. 



I was the last to leave. I sat in the office for at least an hour before my grandmother came to pick me up. My Dad’s parents passed before I was born, and I was 2 when Grandpa passed, so Grandma was the only grandparent I knew. She lived just under an hour out of town. Mom must've been unable to get away from work. 



“That’s so sad, about your friend, honey.” Grandma said on the ride home. “Your mom got their phone number, she is gonna call so you can talk to him when she gets home.”



“Her.” I corrected.



“*Her*, I'm sorry. What's her name?”



“Mel. Short for Melissa.” I said, trying not to tear up again. “She's cool. She likes Pokemon and Naruto like the rest of the guys. She's really nice, and funny too…” I trailed off for a moment. “Why do bad things happen to nice people?”



“Because God works in mysterious ways.” She assured me. “Death is a part of life. The most important part, because after that is eternity. Forever. And now, Mel’s mom is living eternity with God. With peace, without suffering.”



“But what about Mel?” I asked, a little more defiance in my voice than intended. “It isn't fair to her. Or her grandma, she's gonna have to take care of Mel now!”



“And that experience will be hard for both of them. And they'll fail and struggle and suffer because of it.” She nodded in agreement with me. “And that adversity will be an important part of making who they are. They'll learn from it, hopefully. They'll use the experience to help others, and to better themselves. It may not make sense now, but it will.”



I tried to look at it from that perspective. It helped a little, but I was still conflicted and confused. I felt betrayed by God, betrayed by life and fate. I felt like Mel and I had just drawn the short stick, no reason or rhyme, and would have to deal with losing a parent forever. 



That feeling persisted and would come to haunt me later. But at that moment, I had bigger things in my mind. My mom came home around 6pm. As she came in, she walked to the cabinet and poured herself a glass of wine before spotting me on the couch in the living room. 



“Hey Mark. I'm sorry I couldn't get you today.” She said with a soft frown. “Work was just hell, and I was buried under paperwork and- whatever. Not important right now. I got the phone number for the Pearson house, Mel’s mothe-I mean grandmother’s…” the grim correction brought a sick feeling to my stomach. “Do you wanna talk to her?”



I nodded and followed my mom to the phone on the wall. She punched in the number and waited a moment. “Hello? Mrs. Pearson? Hi, I'm Maria Lawson, Mark’s mom. Yes, Mel’s friend. Yes. I’m so sorry to hear about your daughter…of course. Of course, yes. Yes, he’d like to talk to her.”



She waited a moment before handing the phone to me. 



“Hello…” a soft voice meekly whimpered into the phone. 



“Mel?” My voice shuddered a bit but I swallowed, steeling myself for my friend. “H-hey! I'm um. I'm sorry.” 



There was a pause, but I heard her stifle a sob. I couldn't think of what to say at first. *I know how you feel?* Insensitive. *I wish I could help?* No, that felt hopeless. Finally, I gave up and just began to speak. “Look…it's hard. It's really hard. And people are gonna say it gets better with time and you just have to wait. And it sucks because they're right. But…” I could feel myself about to break into tears, but continued. “But the waiting and stuff doesn't have to be all bad, you know? You can be sad and miss them but still have fun. There's still good days!” I had began to tear up. I looked back to see my mom sitting quietly at the table, giving me a soft, proud look. 



Mel cried into the phone for a second, sniffing before she spoke with a wavering voice. “Quincy and Tre called earlier too. You guys are so nice.” She said between sobs. “I…thanks. I'll be okay.”



“If you need anything from me or Mom, please tell me.” My mom gave a nod of approval. “Tre and Quincy probably said the same thing but you can call any of us.”



“Okay.” She took a deep breath. “I've gotta go…I won't be back at school until Monday. I need time with my grandmother….Can we talk tomorrow, too?”



“I'll call you when I get home, promise.” I smiled. “Whenever you're ready to hang out again, just tell us.”



“...I had a dream last night.” She said suddenly, softly. “About my mom. And she mentioned the tower.”



“What happened?” I asked almost reflexively.



“I…I don't wanna talk about everything. Not now…maybe another time. But. We need to find it again.”



I nodded, then remembered I was on the phone. “Yeah. We will. I hope you feel better.”



We said our goodbyes and I hung up, staring at the wall. Mel didn’t explain the dream to me, not until years later. Still, she didn’t need to. The pieces of a puzzle I didn’t know I was building had begun to fall into place. The tower, my dad, Mel’s mom, the dreams. It wasn't a coincidence.



“You're a good friend.” My mom called out. But I didn't register it. I was too busy trying to figure it out. Figure out what the tower was, why it wasn't there most of the time, and how it was connected to my dad. And now, to Mel’s mom.
