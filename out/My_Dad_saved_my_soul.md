I didn't know where else to post this,it's been driving me crazy,I see it,I see it everywhere I go,I can't escape it,it's always there and I don't know how to get rib of it.
My names Kira I've been living in Greece all my life,in the same house with my sister and mother,my father died in a fire back in 2015,we were very close,he'd always comfort me and buy me everything I wanted and we could afford.As you can tell when I found out my dad died I couldn't do anything,I felt numb and I refused to go to school,talk to anyone,eat anything or get out of my room,this was my life for months,I couldn't get over it in any way,I couldn't even sleep.I felt disappointed in myself,I knew acting like a bitch to everyone wouldn't fix anything but I still did it.

Until 5 years later in 2020,I've got over my father passing away,not that I didn't miss him it's that I wasn't mentally destroyed anymore,of course I missed him.I would think of him in random times 
I would still cry at the thought of him never neing dead.'Would he still love me the same?''How would he look like?' Or sometimes 'Is he in heaven?''Does he think of me?' And stupid things like that..Until one night in Christmas 2022 which was his name day I saw him on my dream.
He was sitting on a chair I have across my bed looking at me,when he noticed I saw him he started talking to me.I was so happy,I thought he was really there,everything felt so real,I wish it was.

He suddenly stopped talking and told me to wake up,I didn't know what he was talking about,he then told me this 'If you don't wake up now you'll end up like me and you don't need that' 'Dad what are you talking about?' 'Wake up Kira,please wake up before its too late' 'Before it's too late for what?' I could hear chains,bones cracking and fade screams.God I wish I woke up when he told me to.This would've never happened.'It's too late now Karia,he's already here' was the last thing my dad told me before disappearing and on his place appearing a disgusting creature.My stomach turns even to the thought of it,have you ever seen raw human organs?That's what it was,raw human organs glued together with a black looking liquid,red glowing eyes and one big black horn.It smelled like rotten flesh mixed with gasoline.It felt so real that I could even smell it.Soon I woke up,God I wish I didn't,that's where everything started to get downhill.

I woke up in cold sweat thinking about this 'weird' dream.'What a big imagination'i thought,bit then it hit me.This smell,the rotten flesh,the gasoline.The sound or cracking bones.I turned around and there it stand,in the chair it did on my dream.As soon as I turned to see it it disappeared.I got out of my room as fast as I could and went to sleep with my mom.Yes I know I'm too old for it,but believe me I could better sleep with my mom than in my room.The night went by with the sound of the cracking bones,my mom couldn't hear it.'Maybe I'm imaginating all this' is all I thought before drifting off to sleep.The next day I woke up and went down stairs to eat breakfast,it was around 9:30am,my normal time I wake up in holidays.It was raining,no,there was a storm outside,but I didn't care,I liked the sound of the rain,it always calmed me.We had the lights open because there was no light from outside,I started going downstairs when the light closed,'That's odd' I thought,until I turned my head upstairs and saw it.It was staring at me,I was shocked I couldn't move.We locked eyes,those red blood disgusting eyes.It disappeared some seconds later.I was still standing there,processing what happened,I couldn't believe it.I wanted to believe it was in my mind but I couldn't,it was impossible to be in my imagination infront of me.I snapped out of it and went downstairs to eat breakfast,I didn't say anything about it.


From then I've been seeing it everywhere,at home,school,the mall,the movies,my room,the mirror. I always hear this chains and cracking bones,everytime I close my eyes it pops into my mind.When I'm alone I can even smell the rotten flesh and gasoline.Im sick of it,I'm scared,I can't live like this.Everytime I look at it always comes closer everyday.It know I can see it,but it doesn't do anything,it just stands there.

One night I went to sleep I saw it,it looked..even scared,disgusting,ugly,scary..It came closer to me and talked,for the first time in all these months.Its voice,it's voice was so  deep and sharp.It sounded nothing like it looked.'No one can save you from your faith' is all it said and it..smiled?I don't know it looked like it smiled..It's sharp,yellow teeth with red stains showed..It started coming closer to me,when it stopped inched away from me.Something grabbed my hand,I thought it was that thing but no,the hand was a human hand,I turned around and saw him.My dad.The 'creature' I'm gonna call it looked at me in disgust and turned around, 'You're lucky you have and angel by your side' Is all it said before disappearing.I turned to look at my dad and he was smiling,no ,not the creepy smile,but a sweat,caring,loving smile,the ones he always did.'I'll always protect you,even when I'm not by your side,I'll always love you,even if I can't saw it,I'll always care even if I can't reach you' this exact words came out of his mouth.He let go of my hand and disappeared.
I woke up the next day.No sounds,no smell,no figure.It disappeared,it was gone,my dad made it leave,my Das saved me,or better to say my soul.I then went and light a candle for him.I love my dad,and I know he'll always protect me even if he's not here.
