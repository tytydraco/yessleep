My watch’s timer read *16:02* when I skied out of the forest onto a new trail.

Billy’s voice followed me the whole way. I was paranoid of everything now. The way the trees seemed to make conscious movements, and how the wind tried to whisper in my ear.

Through all this I struggled to focus. I didn’t know where Tim was, and I didn’t remember the time limit correctly for this mountain. 20 minutes? 25? 30?

I didn’t intend to wait and see the consequences of breaking this rule. Noises kept echoing out from the surrounding trees and I did my best not to look up from the trail ahead. Accidents like the one that caused me to separate from Tim could not be afforded anymore.

Luckily this trail was relatively level so I coasted down to the bottom with no more accidents.

It took 30 more seconds before I could hear Tim. It was my name he was calling. Something about the crispness of his unaltered voice made me know it was him. Billy’s voice had sounded damp and heavy.

I found Tim hugging his knees at the end of the next trail.

“As soon as I hit the bottom of that trail, I turned around and you were gone. The trails shifted again.”

I pulled him to his feet.

“It’s fine. We’re good now, let’s go.”

He nodded with worry on his face when he noticed how wild my eyes were.

The best plan I could think of at the time was, since the trails moved randomly, we just needed to ski as fast as possible down each trail until we end up at the lift.

Tim asked what if we end up on a trail that ends off a cliff face. I told him that’s a risk we must take, and one that I was more than willing to. Unlike the first mountain, Mountain #2 targets both your body and your mind. And I didn’t know how much more my fragile sanity could take.

We started off, practically melting the snow with how fast we burnt down the slopes. It required all the concentration I had left, as I identified the smoothest way down on each trail we passed through. Still, Tim pulled ahead, evidence of his superior skiing.

We somehow managed to make it through another black diamond, incident free, when our saving grace rose into view.

“There! Lift!” Tim pointed. It was at the end of the next trail, a blue square, nothing special. I checked my watch again.

*19:02*

A memory floated. The time limit was 20 minutes.

From behind us, wood was cracking and splintering. Further up the trail, I could see the trees moving. Not from the wind or any natural phenomena, no, these trees sliced through the snow like a snorkel through water.

I felt a spike of lightning stab me through the nape of my neck. It must have been my body producing an extreme flight or fight reaction. There’s a lapse in my memory from that moment to when we made it to the lift.

It was there we finally saw Russ again.

“*Wait*!”

Tim and I stood next to the lift, maybe 10 meters from the end of the trail. Russ was almost halfway down, skiing erratically and throwing his hands in the air like a blow-up in front of a car dealership.

A wave of trees was crashing down upon him. They closed up the trail behind him like a zipper, slamming into each other and creating a great wall of wood as they went. There was space between Russ and the moving trees, but they were gaining.

We could barely hear him even though you could tell he was screaming like a girl.

He was gonna make it though. We began to hear him more clearly.

“HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT.”

He couldn’t have been more than 10 meter from the end of the trail when he faltered, tipped, and tumbled into the snow.

“Russ!” Tim pushed off his skis, heading for Russ. He was out of my reach for me to grab him.

Of all the horrific events that transpired on those mountains, for some reason this is the one that frequents my mind the most. I didn’t sleep for a month afterward, until I was forced to admit to myself.

That I can confidently say there *was* enough time to save Russ. He was close enough and Tim was fast enough.

But I couldn’t let Tim go. All I could see were those trees eating up the path behind Russ.

In a last ditch effort, I threw my ski poles at Tim's feet. One bounced off, but the other tangled between his legs and threw him off balance and onto the ground. I jumped on him and denied his attempts to get back up.

“He’s right there! LET ME GO!”

Tim punched me, hard, in the jaw. My vision spilled to the side but I wrapped my arms around his torso and used my weight to pull him to the ground again. I was able to pin his arm and start to drag him back towards the lift, while he screamed the entire time.

One of Russ’ skis had popped off his foot. He might’ve been able to make it down like that, but he had wasted too much time patting around the snow looking for his missing ski. When he finally got up he had time to say:

“Fuck it, I’m good guys. I made it, I’m goo-“

Then, the forest swallowed him. The trees had caught up to him and crashed down on him with the force of a waterfall, shaking the snow from their branches and creating temporary snowfall around us.

Just like Billy, the forest had decided to keep Russ.

By then I had managed to maneuver Tim into the loading area. We had no choice but to board now.

Tim wasn’t screaming anymore. He wasn’t moving. He allowed the chair to take him off his feet and start to lift us into the air. His ski goggles hung around his neck and there were tears frozen on his cheek.

I had to get my breathing under control. I felt like I was going to pass out.

We were being carried over Mountain #2, and once again there were no trails visible. Just dense woods with no discernible way through. We must’ve been outside of the veil again.

“Guys?”

Russ’ voice echoed out from the trees below us.

Tim began to search frantically over the edge of the chair.

“It’s Russ. Phil we have to go back he’s still there.”

“Stop,” I whispered.

And yet, I was hopeful too. His voice was crisp and authentic. It really sounded like Russ.

“I’ll wa*ii*t for you here. Please, come back for me!”

No. They had just gotten better at imitating us. But I could still hear the flaws. The cracks and lags in their cadence.

“Russ, we’ll be back I promise!” Tim assured the imposter.

“I miss you, already.”

There was a momentary waver in Tim’s face at that but he looked at me now smiling.

“Russ is fine, we just need to get help.”

I stayed quiet. We were quite some distance in the air and could see the other mountains now. Below us, I was able to spot another lift line. Tracing it with my eyes, I saw how it connected from the bottom of Mountain #2 to the peak of Mountain #1.

“We’re going to die here, man we’re fucked,” I wailed. Finally, my façade shattered. There was no hope.

“I’m sorry Tim but we’re so fucked. I’m sorry dude, we’re dead.”

Tears and snot ran slowly down my face and froze to my skin.

We were on the wrong lift. Blotting out most of the sky in front of us was the behemoth. Mountain #3 waited for us.

Tim spent the rest of the lift ride trying to calm me down.

Towards the end Tim pulled out the map and tried to figure the best way down for us. After a few glances he put the map away, quickly and without a word.

The lift rose into the unloading station and Tim put his hand on my shoulder. I was still wiping icicle tears off my face.

“We’re getting off now. It’ll be fine, and Russ is wait –”

“Russ is fucking dead, that wasn’t him.”

We both pushed off our seat and skied out onto the peak. You could see everything up there. And right there was our haven, civilization, and yet it was so distant. I could make out houses, only tiny drops in the distance, separated from us by miles of mountain and forest.

The wind blew far harder and the temperature was much colder on Mountain #3. Every breath was a gasp to get as much fleeting oxygen into your lungs as possible.

“You heard him, Phil. He’s not dead, we have to hurry.”

“Stop it, Tim. That wasn’t him. There are things on that mountain that can mimic us… I heard Billy.”

“Billy?”

I insisted with my hands.

Tim waved me off.

“That was after you hit your head right? Come on, you heard him, that was Russ.”

“I REMEMBER THOSE FUCKING RULES, TIM!”

He flinched.

I continued, shaking.

“There’s imposters and the noises we heard. I remember… Russ is dead.”

I watched Tim digest this. His eyes smoldered when he looked at me again.

“You killed him.”

“No –“

“He was right there we could’ve saved him!”

“How do you know that!”

“FUCK YOU MURDERER!”

I tried desperately to appeal to him but he wouldn’t listen. But that was Tim. Too righteous for his own good. I wish I could’ve been the person he thought I was.

“I was trying to save you. And I did!”

“I would rather have died with him.”

He didn’t shout this. He said it blandly. This part is the most vivid to me. The way he looked at me, not as a brother anymore. It was plain and simple. I was nothing to him now.

Tim casually pulled out the map and tossed it to me before skiing some distance away and squatting. He felt like a stranger.

I couldn’t help but look at Mountain #3 on the map. Three trails down. All double black diamonds.

It would’ve been strange not to laugh then. I clutched my stomach and cackled. I might as well have just thrown myself off the edge of the mountain at that point.

“Phil –”

A tremendous roar cut Tim off. We were compelled to cover our ears and the force seemed to make the ground shake. Soon, the ground actually did begin to rumble.

I fell onto my ass and saw Tim, unsteady on his skis.

Another terrible bellow that was somehow more ear-piercing than before. Vibrations passed through my body. I physically felt how loud it was.

“The hell is this!?” Tim cried out.

The name flashed in my mind.

Powdered white quicksand split and opened, and Tim sunk into it, chest deep. I tried to crawl towards him, but it was impossible. The snow had a current now and swept us away like an ocean. We were at the top of an avalanche that had formed and were about to ride it all the way down.

Before I was blinded and drowned by dazzling white, I heard the roar again and remembered its horrible name: Grendel.

There was only pitch black when I opened my eyes. Every inch of my body was securely compressed by the weight of all the snow. Claustrophobia gripped me and my breaths became shallow and rapid.

Though I’m athletic, I’m a bit of a nerd too and indulge in a lot of online articles and forums like this. I had read a few stories of skiers caught in avalanches and how they were able to survive.

I focused on one of my fingers and flexed it repeatedly until there was a millimeter of space for it to wiggle around in, kept going until there was a centimeter of space, and then an inch and so on. A slow, tedious process made excruciating by my lack of air.

Forever went by before I was able to reach my face to clear space for breathing. My nose and mouth were unobstructed now and allowed me to take shuddering breaths.

I gathered as much saliva as I could and spat it out. My eyes were barely adjusted, and I could make out the spit hanging on the snow in front of me. It fell right back onto my face and I groaned, trying to blow it off.

Now I was oriented. Thankfully, I wasn’t upside down in the snow, and only had to dig forward to reach the top.

Grendel’s howl shook the snow around me and, funnily enough, helped my further free myself.

Grendel sounded far but it would take a long time to escape from the snow.

I dug until my hands ached and dug some more. I punched my arm through the final layer of snow and felt the wind blowing at my arm. Gingerly, I pulled myself onto the large bank of snow careful not to upset it and cause further shifting.

I pulled myself along on my belly until I found more stable ground to stand on. Another one of Grendel’s roars, closer now, caused the hole I had just dug out of to collapse.

A blue ski caught my eye, sticking out further down the cascade of snow.

Tim.

I hurried over and began desperately shoveling with my hands. He was upside down. Halfway through digging I could tell his body was twisted the wrong way.

I was moaning to myself. When I got to his chest, I renewed my efforts after I saw it rising feebly and falling. Somehow, he was still breathing, and alive.

As carefully as I could, I tried to pull Tim from the snow. His whole body including his fingers was frozen up like in those street fight videos when someone gets knocked out bad.

Still, his chest rose indicating life.

“It’s ok, Tim. I’ve got ya. Come on, we’re going home. It’s ok. I’ll carry ya.”

The state I was in then was indescribable. Catatonic almost, my choice to deny reality and retreat back into my head kept me from collapsing.

I don’t know how, but I dragged Tim for what felt like a mile. I don’t know how long it took, but every five minutes or so, another one of Grendel’s Earth-shattering roars urged me on. They continued to get louder.

At the time, I didn’t know where we were, but I assume the avalanche had carried us all the way down somewhere on Mountain #1. I would occasionally look behind me, back to Mountain #3.

Something was descending it. Trees were being mowed down by something obscured in a big cloud of snow produced by its movements. It was enormous. A lake’s worth of snow dislodged and developed into another destructive avalanche. It careened off towards the opposite side of the mountain and away from us.

Eventually, I encountered the skiers. I fastened Tim’s goggles onto his sightless eyes and made sure neither Tim nor I had any skin exposed through our winter clothes.

I followed the rules exactly, aiming my head down and avoiding any contact with them. The trembling marionettes wobbled past us every time. All the while I dragged my poor brother.

I saw Russ again. Same burgundy snow pants, same frost tipped goggles, same winter jacket with the zipper missing. He jangled along with the rest of them and I made no move to capture his attention. I’m glad Tim wasn’t awake to see him… it.

Seeing Russ must’ve triggered delirium as I kept company with myself the rest of the way by talking to the voices that now echoed and bounced around my cranium. All in ridiculous cartoonish accents:

*just keep swimming, just keep swimming Cold, no? how do we get down? you tell me, its probably just me but tims neck is kinda funny lookin? huh just keep on swimming just keep swimming look behind you (don’t do it)*

Peeking at me from around the next bend was the lodge. Even in the midst of my psychosis I knew that’s where I needed to go.

There were a few skiers milling about the peak, but we passed by with no issues.

I closed the lodge door behind me, kicking it for good measure. Tim was twisted like a pretzel in the middle of the room. My eyes kept wandering around, looking everywhere except at him. I refused to acknowledge it.

“Alright Timmy. You hang here, I’m gonna look around for anything that’ll help us.”

He answered with his faint ragged breaths. His chest barely looked like it was moving.

I shuffled around the internal perimeter of the room, sifting through desks and cabinets looking for God knows what. Eventually, I reached the door to the bathroom.

We didn’t bother looking inside the bathroom the first time we entered the lodge, rather opening the door, glancing at it and quickly forgetting about it. Now, I walked inside and looked around.

Tucked away in the corner behind the open bathroom door, was a small entryway. My phone still had battery and I let the flashlight wash away the shadows lurking within it.

The entryway led to a long rectangular room clearly meant for storage. Four extra sets of skis and ski poles rested against the wall, a massive suitcase-sized first aid kit on top of a wooden sled on the ground, and boots, helmets, a broken pair of goggles, and a flare gun were scattered unceremoniously about the floor. A small wooden chest sat at the end of the hall-like room.

I grabbed the flare gun and held it up to my eyes, inspecting it to see if there was ammo inside. It’s a surprise I didn’t set myself on fire but again I wasn’t exactly lucid. I’m extremely unfamiliar with guns and I couldn’t tell anything from looking at it. The flare gun went into my coat pocket.

I made my way to the chest and after failing to open it the first time, pried it loose with one of the ski poles on the wall. With a pop the rusty lock dropped heavy to the floor.

Inside were three things. A dull revolver that at some point used to be a polished silver, a copy of the rules for the resort, and what looked like some sort of walkie-talkie/satellite-telephone.

The voices in my head quieted. It could all end right here. I had a vision of a helicopter lifting us up into the air and I snatched the phone aggressively trying to figure out how to use it. There were lots of buttons, and I attempted to dial my mom’s phone number but it wouldn’t allow me to input that many numbers. Luckily focusing on the phone gave me a foothold back into reality.

Unfortunately, I had no idea how to work one of these things. I put it down for a second and grabbed the revolver. Its bullets were visible, and in juxtaposition with the gun they resided in, light glistened off the tiny metal in the cylinder.

Feeling more comfortable with its weight in my grasp I held on to it.

If only we had known about this room before everything went to hell. I’m sure things could’ve turned out a lot better. Especially, with an extra set of rules.

It was an exact copy of the previous one and I refreshed my memory. In case you forgot, I’ll provide them again here:

&#x200B;

**Mountain Rules for Three Kings Ski Resort**

**Mountain #1:**

*1. This cabin is your only haven in the resort. Be sure every window and door is always closed and secured. Always know the quickest route back here from wherever you go in the resort. This is Ski Patrol Headquarters and where you will find help.*

*2. Ignore the skiers. They are mostly harmless unless directly interacted with. Avoid contact at* ***ANY*** *cost.*

*3. Never remove or adjust any clothing while in direct line of sight of any skiers. They will know you are not one of them.*

*4. Be mindful and remember the outfits your party is wearing. It is easy to lose track of friends and mistake a skier as one of them. This could be a grave error.*

*5. If a skier notices you, attempt to break its line of sight of you or find a member of Ski Patrol to assist.*

*6. This mountain is the safest and quickest way back down to the base. It is a straight shot down but once you start, the hunt begins. Do not let them catch you. Ski Patrol will not be able to help.*

**Mountain #2:**

*1.* ***NEVER*** *go down any trail on this mountain alone. If you do, it is best to stop skiing immediately and wait for someone to find you. Ski Patrol will routinely ski down the trails to ensure your safety.*

*2. If you notice you’ve been on a trail for longer than 5 minutes, immediately stop and cut through the forest until you reach another trail. Continue skiing from there. No trails on this mountain should last longer than 5 minutes.*

*3. If the forest begins to make noises, make your way to the mountain’s lift as quickly as possible, and leave immediately. If this is not possible, don’t trust any sounds or voices you hear. Wait for a member of Ski Patrol to find you. If anyone else approaches you, flee. The forest will send imposters.*

*4. Do not stay on the mountain for longer than 20 minutes. You will not find your way back.*

**Mountain #3**

***1. Ski Patrol does not patrol this mountain. They cannot guarantee your life even if the rules are followed.***

*2. Ski at the risk of annihilation. If you choose to visit this mountain, ski slowly and deliberately. There is no room for error.*

*3. Total and utter silence is required. If you need assistance do not call for help, if you are injured do not scream; make your way as quickly and quietly to the lift as possible and leave. Waking Grendel up would mean the end of Three Kings Ski Resort.*

*4. This cabin will not protect you if Grendel follows you.*

&#x200B;

What wasn’t on the original copy was a crowded string of numbers written in different handwriting at the bottom of the page. I made the connection quickly and punched the numbers into the phone. They fit.

The phone began to ring. I was shaking and each time a ring ended its shrill cry, I feared I would hear a line disconnect sound.

It rang twenty-seven times before I heard a click. Static.

“Hello? Is someone there, hello? Can you hear me?”

I noticed a large button on the side of the phone and held it down.

“My name is Philip and me and my brother, we need help. Please, hear me.”

I let go of the button. The static greeted me again. And then another click, three short beeps, and finally silence.

Suddenly, I felt hot.

My fist went through the wall with little resistance and I screamed. I yanked my arm free and turned, smashing the junk lying on the ground with ferocious kicks and grabbed the phone and hurled it into the bathroom, shattering the dusty mirror hanging over the sink into a spiderweb of glass shards. Deafening rage consumed my senses and I allowed it to encompass me completely.

From my coat pocket the revolver fell and bounced off the floor. Without much thought I picked it up and placed it under my chin. Snug around the trigger my finger flexed lightly, teasing it. There was a party popper in my hand and if I pulled hard enough, confetti would go flying in the air and everyone would cheer and shout *HAPPY NEW YEAR!* and the party could go on and on…

The phone was ringing. For a second, I couldn’t hear it over the sound of my pulse pumping through my ears. I dropped the gun and scrambled to the bathroom.

I cut my hand on shattered glass snatching at the phone but I barely felt it. I pressed a green button and after a few long seconds I heard through the static:

*“Boy, what the hell are you doing in those mountains?”*
