The events I’m about to share are true. Even now, years later, my skin prickles at the memory. This happened at my mother’s ancestral home—a sprawling, isolated mansion, the kind that belongs in a gothic novel. I won’t name the place, but picture it: a massive bungalow, surrounded by overgrown gardens, orchards, and, beyond them, a shadowy, whispering forest. The village nearby was known for its silence—and for things best left unsaid. The police almost never ventured here. Murders, thefts, even whispered tales of black magic—these were part of local lore, as common as the evening mist. The air itself felt heavy, expectant.

It was June 2020, and the world was in chaos. The lockdowns had everyone on edge, scared to leave their homes, trapped in a silence broken only by rumors of illness and political unrest. In this tense quiet, death came suddenly to our family. My grandfather—a robust 72-year-old—collapsed from a sudden heart attack. The doctors blamed the virus, but he’d always been healthy. My mother was devastated, and I was shattered. The grief was a dark cloud, pressing down on all of us.

Then, just days later, my grandmother died—also “COVID-positive.” But something didn’t add up. She had shared a bed with my mother, comforting each other in grief. If she really had the virus, why hadn’t my mother—or anyone else—fallen ill? Suspicion slithered into our minds. Within weeks, my mother’s vibrant, loving parents were gone. The pain was unbearable. My mother’s siblings were adrift, drowning in loss.

But the nightmare wasn’t over. Ten days later, my great-uncle—my mother’s beloved uncle—died, again from the virus. Three deaths, so close, in a way that defied science and reason. The house reeked of misery, its halls echoing with whispers and sobs. The family splintered; arguments over money, politics, old resentments boiled over. Shadows seemed to cling to the walls.

For nearly two years, the house was quiet—if “quiet” is the right word for a place so clearly haunted by grief and suspicion. Then, in April 2022, hope flickered. My aunt’s wedding approached, and for a moment, laughter returned. Preparations were underway, and the house felt almost alive again.

Until the night everything changed.

It was 2 a.m., and I was alone in the cavernous first-floor hall, headphones in, absorbed in a movie. When my earbuds died, I stood, stretched, and walked toward my mother’s room to charge them. Her door was just past the basement entrance—an old, heavy, brown door that no one ever used. Dust coated the handle; cobwebs clung to the frame.

As I reached for my mother’s door, the basement door creaked. I froze. After a heartbeat of silence, *knock*. Then again. Then a third time. My breath caught. The air turned thick, electric with fear. Then—BANG. A violent knock, loud enough to rattle the frame. I didn’t wait to see what made the sound. I ran—upstairs, to the second floor, heart hammering. Sleep was impossible.

The next morning, I told my mother. She swore she’d heard nothing. The fear dug its claws deeper.

A few days later, my cousins and I played football in the yard. Laughter filled the air—until a voice cut through the noise. It called our names from behind the house, right where the basement door was. The voice was familiar—but not quite right. An elder stopped us before we could investigate. “Don’t follow it,” he warned, eyes dark with fear. “They’re evil. They mimic the voices of those you love, draw you in, and then… you’re gone. Never chase the voice.”

The unease became too much. We called in a paranormal investigator, a man known for dealing with the unexplained. He arrived quietly, studied the basement door, then demanded we open it. He descended into the darkness, only to return pale and shaken. “What’s beneath this basement,” he said, “is worse than you can imagine.” There were no ghosts, no phantoms in the traditional sense. Just the weight of something ancient, waiting.

He asked about the land’s history. We researched, digging into records, talking to the oldest villagers. The truth, when it surfaced, was worse than any ghost story.

Before the mansion was built, over thirty years ago, this land held a **black stone**, rough and unyielding. Villagers had whispered about it for generations. According to legend, the stone demanded a life every year—an offering for good fortune, for the future. The stone, it was said, made pacts with the desperate, the greedy, the damned. When the mansion was raised, the stone was sealed beneath the basement, imprisoned but never dormant.

I remembered, then, how my dog had died suddenly in the basement, years before. The pieces clicked into place. Had the stone awoken during the chaos of 2020, hungering for more? Had something—or someone—slipped into that dark place beneath the house, stirring old, hungry energies?

The scariest part? My mother’s family still lives there. When I visit, the air is thick with a negativity that clings, unseen. I never linger near the basement. Sometimes, I think I hear a faint knocking—or a voice, almost familiar. The house stands, beautiful and terrible, on its foundation of grief and sacrifice. The stone is still there, patient, waiting for its next offering.

And none of us can say when—or who—it will be.
