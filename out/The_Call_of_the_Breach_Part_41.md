[\[Part 40\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1lxlf24/the_call_of_the_breach_part_40/)

Crouched in the trenches with my platoon, I shivered against the cold wind and tried to slow my breathing.

*Mother of God, that’s a lot of armor.*

Across the snowy floor of the valley came row after row of huge iron beasts, snorting tanks, rumbling armored personnel carriers, and lines of MRAV trucks behind them. There were dozens of vehicles headed toward the pass, each no doubt loaded with assault troops, a black tidal wave of shadows that swept forward in the growing darkness. Doubtless columns of infantry followed this spearhead in Humvees not far off, along with mobile artillery and short-range rocket batteries. Had the weather been clearer, they would have moved under a protective cover of drones, helicopters, and fighter jets, but the sky remained clogged with gray banks of frozen moisture. Before the enemy, the last straggles of the refugees scattered like sheep in the frigid snow drifts, their screams of fear barely audible from where we were hidden. While most of the civilians that could make it had already staggered through the pass below us, these weren’t likely to escape what was coming. Even if they evaded the mercenaries, with nightfall closing in the pitiful survivors would surely be found by mutants, and most wouldn’t last till morning exposed as they were to the freezing temperatures.

*How few are we now, we humans? Six thousand? Five? If it weren’t for the Ark River folk, we’d be even less.*

I raised both hands to my mouth and blew warm air into my gloves to keep the fingers nimble. To my left, Jamie waited with her AK in hand, face half-concealed by a white bandana to blend in with the snow, green eyes narrowed against the fading light. We didn’t say anything to one another, but I knew she watched for any sign of Chris the same as I did. He and his rearguard had yet to turn up, not a single man or truck, and that left a sharp pain in my chest. We needed every man we could get to hold this line, and if Chris didn’t show up, then there could only be one reason.

Hot liquid tried to blur at the edges of my vision, and I blinked it away with venomous denial.

*No. He’s not dead. He’s not.*

A figure shifted to my right, and Sergeant McPhearson squatted beside me to hold up a surplus green field telephone, the wire snaked through the trench line. “All gun pits are on a party line. Got a connection run out to the commander’s trench down the hill. He wanted to speak to you, major.”

Taking the green phone in my hand, I drew a shuddery breath and pressed the chilly plastic to my ear as the enemy convoy rolled closer. “Major Dekker here.”

*“Hold your fire until we open up.”* Sean’s voice came through as a whisper, and my spine tingled with the dread of knowing that he was likely within shouting distance of the lead ELSAR troops, his foxholes concealed in the trees alongside their advance. *“No matter what happens, do not move, do not leave your trenches, do not reveal your position. Pick your targets, aim for the tracks, and stand by.”*

“Will do.” Swallowing hard, I tasted the ice in December’s cruel wind and eyed the approaching tanks. “Good luck, sir.”

*“God speed, Major.”*

Seconds ticked by, and the ELSAR vehicles rumbled onto what remained of the muddy road into the pass. The lead tank rattled onward, perhaps two hundred yards down the hillside, and I could feel the tension in the air as we huddled low in our trenches. Jamie worked her jaw in pent-up anxiety, while Charlie hunched against the frozen earth rampart, flexing his grip on the scoped rifle I’d given him. I could smell the salty diesel on the breeze, felt the vibrations of the steel treads in the ground beneath my half-unthawed boots, and tightened clammy fingers on the icy steel of my battered Type 9. In my mind, I thought of Chris, my heart aching at the cascade of wonderful memories he occupied and hoped beyond reason that he was somehow still alive.

*Kaboom.*

A blinding flash lit up the road for just a moment, followed by a tall plume of smoke, dirt, and debris. The shockwave whipped at our clothes even within the protection of our trenches, and a spoon-shaped object rocketed upward in a haphazard spin of flames. I recognized the severed turret of an enemy tank as it tumbled away into the distant trees, chunks of sizzling steel raining from the sky in its wake.

*Boom, boom, boom.*

Three more improvised mines detonated under the enemy armor, followed by the shrieking hiss of rocket launchers, and the hum of machine-gun fire. Bright red and green tracers sliced across the pass road as bullets flew back and forth between the forested embankments. No one counted their rounds or thought of conserving ammunition for tomorrow; if this failed, there would be no tomorrow. Instead, Sean’s forces unleashed all their fury on the bewildered mercenaries and turned the valley into an enormous light show of death.

“All units, open fire!” I shouted into the field telephone, and our line of emplacements erupted with every last piece of artillery we still had.

Surplus mortars from the militia, our own self-made field guns from New Wilderness, and captured howitzers from the ELSAR depot belched fire into the enemy column, choking the air with soot. Trees shattered like toothpicks, earth banks crumbled under the barrage, and the snow around the pass churned to mud. Bits of metal sprayed from the hits our crews scored on the ELSAR vehicles, most shells bouncing off their thick armor, but enough getting through to the main target; the enemy’s steel tracks.

Sprockets bent, steel shattered, and treads cracked as they were struck again and again by high-explosive rounds. Even the heavily armored Abrams tanks clattered to a stop when their broken tracks ran off the rollers, the mighty war machines bogged down in the icy muck like great iron pigs. Panicked, the enemy soldiers tried to dismount in order to engage Sean’s fighters, only to emerge into a deadly crossfire that chopped them down like corn stalks. Their comrades in the other vehicles behind them charged into the trees with guns blazing, but as Sean had predicted, they were now far too close to call in their own artillery support. Blocked by obstacles, trees, ditches, and mines, they were picked off one-by-one, and the screams of the crewmen as they roasted inside the burning hulks floated on the winter air with poisonous clarity.

“I want fire superiority on that road!” Atop the ridge, I moved through the trench in a bent over crouch, and shouted orders to my men as they added their own small arms fire to the din. “Watch for foot mobiles coming through the base of the hill! Pour it on em!”

Our trench was laid out in front of our dug-in artillery positions, a last line to defend them in the event ELSAR broke through Sean’s men. The gun pits were connected to our trench in a series of narrow slit trenches, enough to get back and forth without risk of exposure to enemy fire, though there weren’t deep enough to walk upright. Down the hill from us, Sean’s men were dug in through the forest on both sides of the road in three lines, arrayed to have overlapping fields of fire on the enemy as they advanced. This negated our dismal lack of night vision equipment, in that the only people outside of a trench or foxholes were enemy soldiers, so our troops could shoot at anything that moved with impunity. Our positions weren’t the best concealed in the world, camouflaged with old bed sheets and snow, but the mercs were stranded out in the open. They couldn’t retreat, couldn’t advance, and were split up into little groups of five or eight men that clung to whatever cover they’d found with desperation. We’d hit them right where it hurt, and now that they were on level terms with us, it seemed we had knocked the fight right out of ELSAR’s men.

Pausing near a forward machine gun nest to catch my breath, I peered over the dirt parapet with tense optimism.

*So far, so good . . .*

*Ka-boom.*

One of the howitzer pits went up in a sheet of orange fire, and screeches of pain from its crew were followed by more shells landing around our trench works. Tank rounds whistled in from somewhere across the valley, and without our artillery to keep them suppressed, the scattered infantry crawled forward to engage Sean’s men at close range.

My eye caught the flash of large guns from the tree line a quarter mile across the valley floor, and I squinted in the dark to let my eyes sharpen.

Four ELSAR tanks sat at the edge of the forest, their long guns hitting us from a distance we would struggle to match with our patchwork of heavy weapons. They had seen the destruction of their brethren in the vanguard, and had the wisdom to keep away, using their high-tech targeting systems to peer through the fog of war. With my enhanced vision, I could just make out the flicker of vehicles in motion behind them, doubtless carrying more men, ammunition, and artillery. Despite taking heavy losses, the mercenaries were slowly grinding through our defenses bit by bit, and as soon as these new reinforcements could get into the battle we would be overrun.

“Gunners, target the far tree line!” I called above the noise, dirt raining from the enemy shells to ping against the green field telephone in my hand. “They’re in the trees! I need a rocket team at—”

*Wham.*

Under my feet the world lurched as the frozen earth ripped upward in a geyser of force. My ears rang, my lungs ached, and I tasted blood on my upper lip as it flowed from my nose. Hundreds of small rocks and bits of shrapnel pummeled my body, and everything spun in my field of vision as I slammed to the ground.

Blackness nibbled at the corners of my vision, and my brain struggled to differentiate between the real and the imagined. I saw my men around me, fighting, dying, wounded in the snow. I saw Chris lying next to me on our wedding night, his eyes shining, his smile warm as a flame. Jamie’s face floated above me, her voice distorted and far away in the darkness. My mother appeared to shake me awake on Christmas morning, holding a plate of pancakes.

*Up. I have to get up. Can’t stay here.*

Ice-cold wind rushed into my lungs, and I sat upright in the mud.

Gunfire tore through the air with ferocity, and I watched gray-uniformed men surmount the leftmost flank of our trench line, fighting their way up the slopes from the pass road. More reinforcements poured across the valley from the distant trees, waves of men that ducked from shell hole to shell hole to avoid the withering gaze of our machine guns. In the trees below our position, Sean’s men fired in all directions as the enemy flooded the woods, an irresistible tide of assault troops that reduced their positions to dust with grenades and flamethrowers like clockwork. They came from everywhere, hundreds of mercenaries and auxiliaries moving in well-trained squads, and our men seemed to melt like the snow in the face of their advance, cut down in droves as they struggled to hold them back. There were too many soldiers, the tanks too well protected, their mortars hidden behind the opposite forest to the north. Try as we might, the horrible realization sank into my gut that we couldn’t stop them all.

“We’re pinned down.” Jamie hunched next to me and loaded another curved steel magazine into her rifle with hands that trembled from either the cold or adrenaline. “They’ll be here soon. Are you hit?”

Shaking myself to clear some of the fog from my head, I reached for my Type 9, but never got the chance to reply.

A man vaulted over the top of the trench not twenty yards away, and his rifle spat in the darkness with a sudden burst of light.

*Bam, bam, bam.*

Dirt kicked up around my shoulders, and I dove to the side as Jamie brought her rifle to bear.

*Crack.*

The bullet caught him just under the chin, and the enemy soldier crumpled into the trench as a limp heap. A second jumped up to take his place, three more converging on our left and right, the fighting so close that I didn’t bother using the sights on my submachine gun. With the barrage of muzzle flashes, everything turned into a shutter-stop parade of macabre horror in the inky shadows.

I fired, and my burst cut down a mercenary mid-stride, his armor catching most of the rounds while a few went into his right hip.

One of our men across the line took a round to the skull, and the machine gun emplacement he’d been manning fell silent. A mortar girl began to throw the mortar bombs by hand over the sandbags of her gun pit, the mercenaries too close to hit with the launch tube. Machine gunners fired point-blank into their opponents, holding the barrel shroud of their weapons until the gloves on their hands charred black, the flesh underneath swollen from the heat. Others shot until their ammo pouches ran dry, after which they swung the empty rifles as clubs. In the forests below the ridge, flame troopers from our Worker faction dueled with a flamethrowing team from ELSAR over the right flank of the line, both sides burning each other to death with howls of superhuman rage and pain as the trees went up around them. Grenades exploded everywhere, sometimes right in the middle of both sides, and shredded bodies like tissue paper. Knives, entrenching tools, and fists replaced guns when no one had time to reload, many striking both friend and foe in the pitch blackness between shell-bursts. Smoke and dirt made the air unbreathable, the ground slick with thawed mud and gore, every step finding a new corpse to trod underfoot. It was hell on earth, terror and hate, fear and pain all rolled into a constant slog of mind-tearing noise that no amount of earplugs could muffle.

“Hannah!” In the apocalyptic chaos of the dark, Jamie called out to me and pointed toward the leftmost end of our trench line as we stumbled together through the morass. “We have to blow the pass! There’s too many!”

Sick enough to want to vomit, but with no time to even double over, I worked to load another magazine into my steaming Type 9 and screamed back on vocal cords that were rubbed raw. “We can’t! Our boys are still out there. They need more time.”

“It’s too late.” Without time to reload her Kalashnikov, Jamie drew her pistol to fire at another mercenary, a bullet clipping her blonde ponytail in the shadows. “Either we do this now, or they’ll cut the det cord and spike the charges. We can’t—”

From the muck-laden floor of the trench, a grimy ELSAR man lunged with bared teeth at Jamie, and tackled her to the ground, his uniform already stained red with blood. I couldn’t shoot him, not with how entangled he and Jamie were, and something in my mind snapped.

Before I could think, my hands were on the man’s throat, and I shrieked like a wild creature trying to claw at his eyes. I didn’t think to reach for anything else, not my knife, pistol, or even a rock on the ground. All my training and technique went out the window, and instead I threw myself at the merc with all the strength I had.

*Smack.*

Even wounded as he was, the solider was a mountain of muscle, and his fist pummeled my face over one shoulder with enough force to send me tumbling backward. My nose ached, the blood flowed fast and thick from both nostrils, and I saw stars. It reminded me then of how small I was, still a skinny girl despite the mutations, the training, and the desperation. This man likely had several years of military experience on me, standing a head taller and a few dozen pounds heavier. In a fair fight, neither Jamie nor I stood a chance.

Unfortunately for the merc, however, we Rangers had never been taught to fight fair.

Distracted by my rabid flailing, the man lost his iron grip on Jamie’s hair, and she sank her teeth into his hand.

The soldier roared in pain, and he recoiled backward in shock, Jamie managed to get her arm free to snatch her Beretta from the filthy snowmelt.

*Bang.*

Gritty warm brain matter spattered over my face, and the bullet whizzed by my ear on its way out of the soldier’s helmet-covered skull.

Another enemy dashed through the snow toward us, but I swung around in time to empty my Type 9 into his belt buckle.

*Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-click.*

My rounds stitched him from hips to nose, and the bolt rammed home on an empty magazine before the bloody corpse even hit the ground.

Her fingers wormed into the back of my war belt, and Jamie dragged me through a side trench into an abandoned mortar pit, where we collapsed atop four dead New Wilderness men. With no time for sentiment, the two of us gasped for air on our backs as we hid amongst the still twitching dead from the nightmare outside the sandbag ring.

“How much ammo do you have left?” Jamie rifled through the pockets of the corpses we lay on top of, her search turning up nothing but spent casings and empty guns.

Pawing at my canvas chest rig, I gulped hard against the resurgent nausea and held up two steel magazines. “Not much. You?”

Her face pale with dread, Jamie dragged the remaining Kalashnikov magazine free of its pouch and locked it into the receiver of her rifle. “Last one.”

Jamie and I stared at one another, each a haunting visage of our former selves. Jamie’s pixie-like features lay smeared with blood and grime, her bleach-blonde hair tangled and singed from the constant explosions. I saw fear there, genuine hopeless terror that doubtless reflected on my own muck-covered face, and I knew then that we were doomed. Our men fought to the bitter end all around us, but we were still isolated, unable to move for the withering enemy fire. With hot brass melting into the snow at our boots, my hand found Jamie’s, and we clung to each other in the dark, bracing for the inevitable.

*Hissss . . . pop.*

High in the sky, a lone red flare shot into the clouds and illuminated the battlefield in a bloody hue.

*Splat, splat, splat.*

Atop the trench works, mercenaries tumbled back down the slope, heavy rounds chewing right through their body armor as if it were butter. The reports of the guns echoed on the heels of the enemy’s flesh tearing, and more gunfire picked up in the valley below. Orange splashes of color hit the clouds as multiple fires came to life, deep *boom-booms* of heavier shelling, and from above the chaos of battle, a euphoric cheer went up from our lines.

“What the . . .” Jamie peeked over the ramparts of the mortar pit, and her expression melted in surprise.

I dared to crawl up beside her and blinked down at the valley floor in speechless bewilderment.

*No way.*

The ELSAR squads were in full retreat, scattered and broken, falling over themselves to sprint down the hillside and back across the valley plain. They ran from the forests, from Sean’s men, over the open snowy fields as fast as their exhausted limbs could go, pursued by our bullets all the way. Far beyond them, the tanks in the distant trees burned, the tall pines already in flames, and I could hear the sounds of their mortar pits cooking off in the searing heat. Tracers chased the enemy through the snowy night, and from the shadows of the wilderness came another wave of men.

They closed in on ELSAR from two sides, like a great set of pincers that stabbed from the icy forests with lethal speed. Many were on foot, but some rode on motorcycles, horses, and even Bone Faced Whitetail. Five captured tanks rolled across the field to continue pouring shells into the enemy armor and sent the hapless ELSAR trucks scrambling. Above the lead tank, I glimpsed the green banner of New Wilderness caught high in the breeze and heard the war cry of the Ark River riders as they charged, firing their rifles from the saddle.

“Dekker.” Crystalline rivers etched their way through in the mud on Jamie’s cheeks as she both laughed and wept in relief. “Bout time he showed up.”

My eyes blurred, chest tight with overwhelming joy at our good fortune, and I squinted to try and spot my husband, even though at this range it would be almost impossible despite my enhanced vision. Chris had to be down there, I knew it in my soul, an exhilarating rush that made my head spin. Together, Jamie and I watched Chris’s men chase the enemy all the way back across the valley, the last mercenary vehicles rumbling back the way they’d come at top speed. Sean’s plan had worked. Koranti’s forces were beaten, the way to the pass remained open for us, and now our army could withdraw to safety in the southlands. We’d done it.

We’d won.

I wiped at both eyes with shaking hands and tilted my head back to breathe in deep lungfuls of the cold night air.

*Oh . . . oh no.*

Stars twinkled down at me, more and more as the clouds drifted away, the sky clearing in a slow roll of blue-black expanse. My ears, healing at their enhanced rate beyond what a normal human’s would have, tickled with the muffled *whop-whop-whop* of steel rotors on the northern horizon. Somewhere miles away, tiny pinpricks of light rose from the line demarking earth from sky, and the swarmed into the air like shooting stars.

My heart sank, mouth opening and closing in a scream that wouldn’t come.

*No.*

Stumbling forward, I tried to run down the slopes of the hillside, only for Jamie to wrap both arms around my shoulders to hold me back. Chris had to know, he had to be warned, but no matter how much I kicked and thrashed, Jamie wouldn’t let me go. She could see them too now, along with the others, the worn grins of the survivors fading into horrified grimaces as the lights traversed the sky.

*No.*

More streaks of light soared into the heavens, dozens of them from north, east and south, enough to send my brain into a total meltdown. It was so obvious now, the blatant frontal assaults, the sloppy armored attack, the advancing of the enemy into our machine guns with reckless ambition. Crow had learned from our many ambushes of her forces, and this time she’d been one step ahead of us. Now she, and her vast batteries of rocket-launching artillery, knew exactly where we were.

There was no way they could miss.

“*No!*” I screamed at the top of my lungs, Jamie dragged me backward into the nearest trench, and the missiles streaked down to bury the valley, our army, and Chris in an enormous sea of flame.
