An otherworldly breath, like a spectral wind, whispered through the silent town. Whispers of China's struggle permeated the collective consciousness, but an inscrutable force tugged at the edges of my reality, beckoning me to the mist-laden outskirts where elusive figures materialized. Their breaths, a disconcerting wheeze, wove promises of something beyond the grasp of my understanding.

The engine's hum, now a relentless drumbeat, synchronized with my own, as if becoming one with them was the only accurate diagnosis. The patients, once recipients of my care, became subjects of malevolence. "We can do more," a sinister siren echoed through the sterile halls.

I am them. The Ambulancepeople's smog courses through my roads. The town fades, the numbers rise, and the fog embraces all. The clutch of engines, a haunting chorus in my mind, herald an end. They say it's over, but not for me. The ambulances keep coming, a relentless procession, and I, now a willing driver, find solace in the macabre journey with the spectral echoes of an eternal pandemic.
