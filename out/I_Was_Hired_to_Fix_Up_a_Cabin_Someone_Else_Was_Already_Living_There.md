When you do small repairs for a living, you learn the difference between remote and forgotten.

Remote is a long driveway and bad cell service. Forgotten is when the weeds grow up the middle of the lane like nobody’s bothered to flatten them in a while, and the trees lean inward like they’re trying to close the gap behind you.

The job came through email from a “property manager.” No last name. No company logo. No friendly small talk. Just a lockbox code and a list:

Replace two window latches.

Patch a soft spot in the porch step.

Fix a drip under the kitchen sink.

Check the smoke detector.

I’ve done enough of these to know the script. You show up, you fix the little stuff, you text a photo of the finished work, and you leave before the sun gets low enough to make the woods look like a different place.

The address took me off pavement, onto gravel, then onto a lane that was barely a lane anymore. Branches brushed both sides of my truck. The mirrors clicked with every slap of pine needles. There was a smell you only get in places with no neighbors, wet bark and leaf rot and that cold mineral scent that comes off shaded dirt.

No mailbox. No posted sign. No tire tracks fresh enough to feel reassuring.

The cabin sat back in the trees like someone hid it on purpose. Dark siding. Metal roof dulled to the color of old coins. Porch sagging a little, not enough to scream “danger,” just enough to make you watch your footing.

I parked and stayed in the seat longer than I meant to. Not because I’m fearless or dramatic. Because the quiet out there didn’t feel empty. It felt managed. Like a room where somebody has stopped breathing so you won’t hear them.

I finally got out, grabbed my tool bag, and walked up.

The lockbox was on a porch post, exactly where the email said it would be. One of those common black ones with a rubber cover. I flipped it open, punched in the code, and pulled out the key.

It was warm.

Not sun warm. Not “it’s been sitting in black plastic” warm.

Warm like a hand.

I stood there with my thumb on the ridges and told myself to stop doing that thing where you make a story out of a sensation. It could’ve been a dozen normal reasons. Sun, heat trapped in the box, whatever.

Then my boot hit the second step.

It flexed under one corner. Not the whole board, just a particular spot, like someone had relieved pressure from beneath it. A small squeal came with it, not a wood squeak. A thin metal sound, like a nail moving against a bracket.

I crouched and saw a pale line of fresh sawdust tucked into the seam where the step met the stringer. Bright, new dust against gray wood that had weathered for years. Dry, too. Loose enough that it stuck to my fingertip.

Someone had been cutting or drilling under this step recently.

There was no reason for that except the reason I was here.

I straightened up and tried the front door. It opened without resistance. Not locked. Not even properly latched, like it had been pulled shut by someone who didn’t care if it clicked.

The air inside hit me immediately: damp pine, dust, and something faintly sour like old dishwater.

I set my tool bag just inside the entry and did what I always do, because I don’t like surprises.

“Hello? Maintenance.”

No answer.

The cabin was one main room with a loft. Kitchen along one wall. Small table. Couch with a throw blanket folded like it came from a catalog. Antler-shaped hooks. A framed print of a lake. The kind of place people imagine when they say they want to “get away.”

And then I saw the things that didn’t fit.

A mug in the drying rack. Cheap white, hairline crack near the handle, a brown smear on the lip that hadn’t fully come off.

A spoon in the sink, bowl down like it had been dropped there without thinking.

A folded sheet of printer paper on the table, creased into thirds like a letter.

Property managers don’t leave spoons in sinks.

People do.

I walked to the living room window because the list said “replace latch.” I figured I’d at least start with something that had a clear beginning and end.

The latch wasn’t broken.

It was new.

Bright metal. Clean screws. No paint crust. No rust bloom. When I touched it, my fingers came away with that faint slickness you get from new hardware that’s still got a trace of manufacturing oil.

I stood there, hand on a latch I was supposed to replace, and my brain tried to line up explanations in a row. Wrong list. Wrong cabin. Someone already did the work and forgot to update the job.

Then something moved in the loft.

Not a settling pop. Not a creak.

A controlled shift. The sound of weight changing position carefully, like someone knew exactly which boards complained.

My hand came off the latch fast.

I didn’t turn my head right away. I watched the window glass like it was a mirror, trying to catch movement in the reflection behind me without making it obvious I’d heard anything.

Nothing in the reflection. The loft opening stayed dark.

“Is someone here?” I asked, louder than I wanted to.

Silence.

I moved into the kitchen because my body wanted to do something practical. Something that made sense. I looked at the fridge. It hummed. Power on.

A grocery receipt was held to the fridge by a magnet shaped like a fish. The receipt was dated two days ago. I caught a few items at a glance: bread, eggs, deli meat, bottled water. Normal human supplies.

Someone had been shopping for this place.

My phone had one bar for a second and then none. The little “No Service” text felt like a bad joke.

That folded paper kept pulling my attention like a hook under the skin. I walked to the table and opened it.

Heavy block letters. Pressed hard enough to leave a slight ridge in the page.

DON’T FIX THE WINDOW.

No name. No “please.” No explanation.

My mouth went dry in a way that felt physical, like my tongue had thickened.

I set the note down carefully, like touching it too hard would make it worse, and looked back at the window latch. New latch. Note telling me not to fix it. List telling me to fix it anyway.

From the loft, I heard it again.

A breath.

Slow inhale through a nose trying to be quiet.

I didn’t wait to hear anything else.

I grabbed my tool bag and backed toward the front door. My keys were in my hand without me remembering when I’d grabbed them.

My boot hit that second step on the way out.

The squeal happened again.

The breathing stopped.

I got the door open, stepped onto the porch, and started down.

The second step dropped under my weight.

Not a full collapse, just a sudden give, like it had been weakened precisely where a person would step. A bent nail, rusty and turned upward, caught the side of my ankle and went in deep.

Pain flashed hot and immediate. My leg buckled and I caught myself on the porch rail. My palm slid along rough wood and I felt splinters bite.

When I yanked my foot back, the nail tore on the way out. I felt it rip, sharp and wet.

Blood filled my sock fast. It ran down into my boot, warm and heavy, making the inside slick.

I stumbled off the porch into the yard, tool bag dragging, breath shallow like my lungs had forgotten how to work normally.

Behind me, the front door creaked.

I turned.

A man stood in the doorway.

Tall, but not in a movie way. Tall in a way that made the doorframe look smaller. Dark hoodie. Jeans with dirt ground into the knees. His face was bare, no mask, no scarf. Just a calm expression that didn’t match what was happening.

He didn’t rush me. He didn’t shout.

He watched me the way you watch a dog that wandered into your yard.

“I’m leaving,” I said. My voice cracked and I hated it. “I’m leaving right now.”

He tilted his head slightly, like he was listening for something beyond me.

Then he smiled.

It wasn’t friendly. It wasn’t a grin, either. It was the kind of smile you see when someone’s curiosity has been satisfied.

He lifted one hand and tapped the window near the latch, not hard enough to make a point, just enough to show me he wanted my attention there.

“Don’t,” he said, quiet.

One word.

Same as the note.

My ankle throbbed with each heartbeat. Blood soaked the sock and started pooling in my boot. Every step made the wound pull and sting like it had teeth.

I backed toward my truck, trying not to limp too obviously, trying not to show him how bad it was. Gravel shifted under my boots. The injured foot slipped inside the wet sock and my stomach rolled.

He came off the porch behind me.

Not running. Not hurrying. Just walking at the same pace I was, like he knew I couldn’t go fast.

I got to the driver’s door and yanked it open. I threw my tool bag onto the floorboard and hauled myself into the seat, ankle screaming when it bumped the edge. I slammed the door, locked it, and jammed the key into the ignition.

Nothing.

Dash lights flickered once and died.

I tried again. Click. Nothing.

My throat tightened so hard I could barely swallow.

I looked up.

He was by the hood, standing slightly off to the side like he didn’t want to get hit if the engine suddenly roared to life. He looked down at the front tire, then up at me through the windshield.

He raised his hands slowly, palms out, like he wanted me to notice he wasn’t holding a weapon.

Then he pointed down.

A thin wire ran from under my hood into the weeds, disappearing toward the ground. A cheap, deliberate trick. Something you’d do if you knew just enough about batteries to ruin someone’s day.

He’d done it while I was inside.

He’d been close to my truck without me hearing him.

My fingers tightened around the steering wheel until my hands hurt. I didn’t know what else to do.

He walked around to the passenger side where my view was worse. I twisted, trying to catch him in the mirrors.

The passenger door handle rattled once.

Locked.

It rattled again, harder.

Then it stopped.

A half second of silence.

Something blunt hit the passenger window. The glass shuddered.

It hit again. A crack crawled across the corner like a vein.

Third hit and the window crumbled inward in a sheet of safety glass, spilling into the seat like icy grit. The sound was soft and wrong, like breaking a stack of plates underwater.

His arm came through, reaching for the lock.

I grabbed my hammer from the bag and swung hard. The first hit caught his forearm. The impact traveled up my arm. I felt bone under muscle. He hissed and pulled back but not fully, staying committed like pain was just another piece of the job.

I swung again and caught his hand.

This time he made a sharp sound, angry. His other hand grabbed the door frame like he was going to pull himself in anyway.

I didn’t think.

I slammed my palm on the horn.

The sound tore through the trees. It filled the lane. It echoed like it didn’t have anywhere to die.

His head snapped up. He froze.

Not fear. Calculation.

He yanked his arm back out of the broken window and stepped away from the truck fast, glass clinging to his sleeve. His eyes flicked toward the woods like he was listening for something the horn might bring.

I kept the horn pressed until my chest hurt.

He turned and moved quickly back toward the cabin, disappearing inside. The front door shut.

I released the horn and sat there breathing hard, hammer in my hand, ankle pulsing, glass glittering in the passenger seat.

Nothing came. No voices. No engine. No neighbor. No dog barking.

The woods took the quiet back like it owned it.

I forced my body to move.

I popped the hood release and climbed out, staying low, eyes scanning porch and windows and tree line. The air outside felt wrong now, like stepping into a room where somebody had stopped talking mid-sentence.

I limped to the front of the truck. Each step made the wound pull, wet and sharp. Blood had soaked through my sock completely. The boot felt heavy and slick inside.

Under the hood, the wire was clipped to the battery terminal and ran down to a rusty metal stake hammered into the ground. The dirt around it was fresh, darker than the packed soil nearby, like it had been turned in the last hour.

I yanked the wire free and pulled the stake out. My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped it. I threw it into the weeds and didn’t watch where it landed.

Back in the driver’s seat, I turned the key.

The engine started instantly, like it had been fine the whole time and I’d imagined the rest.

Relief hit me so hard it made me nauseous.

I reversed down the lane too fast. Gravel spit. Branches slapped my mirrors. Every rut sent a spike of pain up my ankle.

My phone didn’t find service until I hit the wider road. One bar, then two. I dialed the property manager number while I drove with my knee pressed to the wheel and one hand gripping it so tight my wrist ached.

It rang. Voicemail.

No name. No business. Just a robotic prompt.

I tried again. Same.

I tried replying to the email. It bounced back immediately. Address not found. Like the sender had evaporated the second I pulled away.

I drove to the nearest gas station with lights and people. When I stepped out, my ankle buckled and I had to grab the side of my truck to keep from going down. Blood had seeped out of the top of my boot and streaked the leather.

Inside, under fluorescent lights, the injury looked worse. The nail had gone in at an angle. When I peeled the sock back, it stuck to the wound. The pain made me swear out loud in front of a kid picking out chips.

The clerk wrapped it with paper towels first, then a real bandage from a dusty first-aid kit under the counter. Someone called the county line. A deputy showed up and took my statement. He asked where the cabin was, what the email said, what the sender was called.

When I showed him the email, he stared at the address longer than he needed to.

“Who hired you?” he asked.

“I thought I knew,” I said. “I don’t.”

He asked if I wanted to go back with him.

I said no before he finished the sentence.

He didn’t argue. He nodded like he understood more than he was going to say out loud.

The next day he called.

They went to the cabin.

The lockbox was gone.

The porch step had been replaced with a fresh board.

Inside, it looked staged again. No mug. No spoon. No receipt. No note.

He said the window latch was still new.

Then he paused and told me what they did find.

Under the kitchen sink, the P-trap was brand new. Installed cleanly. No drip.

And on the inside of the cabinet door, in heavy block letters, someone had written:

YOU CAME.

Not a threat. Not a warning.

A statement.

A tally mark.

My ankle healed, but it healed wrong. When the weather shifts, it aches. Sometimes, when I’m driving and my foot settles on the pedal just right, a hot sting wakes up there like it’s trying to remind me not to forget.

I don’t take remote jobs anymore. I don’t touch lockboxes I didn’t install myself. If a place is too quiet, I leave.

I thought that was the end of it.

Then, last week, I opened my inbox and saw a new message with no logo, no signature, and a subject line that said: Small Repairs - Quick Pay.

Inside was a list.

Replace two window latches.

Patch a soft spot in a porch step.

Fix a drip under the kitchen sink.

Check the smoke detector.

No address yet. Just the list.

And beneath it, one final line:

Same code.
