**Mary I**



Mary awoke from yet another one of the strange dreams that had been plaguing her as of late. She took a small sip of water from the glass sitting upon the wooden night-table adjacent to her messy bed. She kept drinking despite the stale taste in the water, and looked towards the other side of the room to the clock on the wall, which read 5:30 AM. With a loud groan, Mary got out of bed, haphazardly throwing off the blanket as she made her way over to the window. It was still pitch black out, but she could still make out the outlines of the field that surrounded her house, as well as the forested area which hid the dirt road to the highway. The crescent moon was easily visible with how open the field was, allowing for tufts of the tall yellowed grass to be illuminated. She could see the barn to the left of the house out of the corner of her eye, and it still looked as sad as ever, having been in disrepair for a number of years. After a while longer of observing, Mary began to feel skittish. Even looking outside for too long a length of time made her uncomfortable. It was a mixture of longing and hesitation that brought her to the window most mornings. To her, the outside was a far away dream. It was something that could be seen, but never touched. With a final parting glance, Mary shut the blinds, her heart beating as fast as it would be if she had been sprinting.

Unable to go back to sleep, Mary walked down the small hallway outside of her cramped room, intending to get something from the fridge. She smiled as she passed the clean picture frame on the wall which showcased her and her twin, Rose, as teenagers. In the picture she was giving Rose a piggyback ride. Mary’s smile quickly faded as she was snapped back to reality by a growl from her stomach. Some moments can only happen once, it would seem, with no amount of longing allowing them to happen the same way again. Mary knew this, yet she refused to let the past be what it was. She hardly cared anymore when it came to personal fulfillment. Rather, she wanted to live her most cherished memories again, realizing full well the impossibility of that desire. They were only half remembered dreams at this point, tinted to a rosy color by the wheel of time. Mary’s train of thought was broken once more by tripping over a slightly raised floorboard as she made her way down the rest of the hallway. She sighed, laying her conflicted thoughts to rest, at least for the time being.

Mary flicked the light switch to the left of the doorframe which led back out to the small hallway, offering her a dim orange light so she could actually see what she was doing. The floor of the kitchen was starting to fall into disrepair due to a small termite infestation, which Mary often noted, but did little about. The downsides of having an older style of house were evident, as the wood based architecture would likely not last forever. She did not even want to consider that thought, as the idea of having to move out was inconceivable. It was where she and her sister grew up, after all. Mary owed it to herself, her sister, and her late parents to sustain their old farmland property the best she could. With that consideration made, she looked into the fridge, seeing that all she had were a couple of eggs, some milk, and a few bottled waters. It would seem she would have to wait for another delivery from Rose. Mary never felt great about being so dependent on Rose, but these doubts were swept aside to some degree by the thought of what would happen to her if she never received aid from her sister. Mary reflected on this, with the idea scaring her, so she decided to crack and make the remaining eggs to try calming herself down.

The light sizzling of the eggs and the peppery aroma did little to make Mary comfortable, as it was still very dark outside. She still felt rather perturbed by where her mind kept deciding to go, and tried to force herself to think of anything else. Mary hated her constant internal questioning, but couldn’t find a way to stop. It was as if it were ingrained into her very being. This sort of disposition meant that she had trouble sleeping at night, which was compounded by how early she often woke, as the night terrors she had would bring her back to consciousness in a cold sweat. Such things had become a commonality, with Mary finding some level of irony that even in the place she was most comfortable in, fate had found a way to break that comfort. So trapped in thought was she that she hardly noticed when the eggs started to burn. Cursing to herself, Mary quickly turned off the burner and scooped the eggs onto a nearby plate. She sat down to eat, not feeling any better than when she had woken up.

After the disappointing meal, Mary figured it would be best to sit for a bit, and try to relax. She walked to the adjacent living room, and sat down in the chair she always sat in. It was a bright red recliner, the feel of which could almost be described as liquid velvet. Mary found she had a genuine attachment to the chair, much like she had with the rest of the house. She reclined back, her worries already starting to wash away, and stared towards the opposite wall. Upon a small divot in the wall sat another picture, this one of Mary and her sister when they were children. She could recall it well, as it was a photoshoot to be remembered. Mary saw that this was a time where she was so young that her hair had not transitioned from the blonde it was then to the dark, curly brown it was now. Overtaken with nostalgia, Mary found herself staring at the frame for a length of time she was oblivious to, before finally averting her eyes as she realized how long she had been sitting there. Mary had always been fond of mirrors into the past such as that. There was nothing more sentimental to her than the framed pictures around the house, and she took comfort in them despite the time that had passed. The sun had finally come up, and with it, Mary got up out of the scarlet bliss she was sitting on to welcome the new day.

Now that she was fully awake, Mary could just barely hear the soft whirring of the generator in the basement, which at this point had become a constant white noise. Oftentimes, the power would cut out, as the lines around her area were not very dependable. Her place was so out of the way that they took a while to fix, leaving her dependent on the generator. This was exacerbated by the storms that would often assail the area, along with the subtle dread of living in the middle of tornado alley. Mary had been fortunate enough to never have to deal with a tornado firsthand, other than once when she was so young she no longer could remember it. Despite this, she still had to deal with the fear of one possibly occurring, as alerts for them were not at all out of the ordinary. With how old the house was getting, it would be decimated if it were ever hit by any extreme weather. Mary shivered at this thought, as she so often did, as that was the one thing she would never be able to prevent.

With the intention to check how much gas was left in the generator, Mary opened the door to the basement, which was in the same hallway as her bedroom. It was an older, wooden door, which looked almost ancient. It was painted red, with flecks of the red paint starting to peel away, revealing the dark brown beneath. Pieces of it were falling apart, with even the copper knob adopting an aged, green look to it. Mary never wanted to get rid of it or replace it, as it was one of the few parts of the house left completely unchanged from her early childhood. The door had the same sentimentality to her as the chair and the pictures, a reminder of more innocent times. She could remember that the door caused her first ever injury that was permanently seared into her mind. When she was seven years old, her sister had slammed it on her ankle, nearly breaking it. Mary could recall her parents having to pick pieces of splintered wood shards out of her leg for an hour afterwards. The memory was one of pain, yet it too adopted a rosy sheen to it over the course of the two decades that had passed. 

Diverting her gaze from the door to the decrepit wooden staircase, Mary tried to watch her step, as the wood surfaces could plausibly break if she put her weight down on the wrong spot. They were almost archaic in their design, an architectural relic from a bygone time. The corners of each step were dusty, and were covered with a small film of cobwebs. She almost never cleaned down there, as the basement felt rather claustrophobic, with its low hanging ceiling and sub-standard lighting. Mary only ever went down to check the generator, fill it up, and leave. Getting off the last creaking step, she took a brief glance at all the neglected antiquities which filled the basement, old possessions from her parents and her grandparents with their silvery reflections long tarnished by accrued grime. As Mary walked towards the generator near the back of the room, she tensed up as she heard the rafters lightly shudder, raining down a thin layer of dust upon her. She began to cough as she checked the generator, noting that she was low on gas, and would have to ask Rose for some more. Hurrying her way back to the staircase, Mary gave not even a parting glance to the old room, leaving it behind once more to be further forgotten. With the arrival of her sister on the horizon, she now had nothing to do but wait.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**Rose I**



Rose drove down the long, lonely road, with still half an hour to go before she would reach the old farm property that her sister resided in. She had her phone in her lap, a single crack ruining the bottom left part of the screen. She made this drive every week, but that did not make it any less of a hassle, as it was a two hour drive each time she went to visit her sister. Rose, despite knowing that her sister was very dependent on her, still felt somewhat irked at the constant visits. It was not a lack of empathy or sympathy that made her feel this way, instead being more the inconvenience it brought. That, and how painful it was every time she had to see the house she grew up in. This thought quickly faded away as Rose took in the sights which were quickly passing her by. The rolling, golden hills and verdance of the farmland had not lost its beauty to her, despite growing up with it. It was as much a comfort to her as her own home and place of business. The growing grayness in the sky did little to shake Rose out of her trancelike state as she continued onward, forgetting the previous uncertainties which clouded her mind.

Rose’s trance was broken when her phone started to vibrate in her lap, ringing out the familiar tune which all calls sounded out. She quickly glanced down at the screen, keeping her peripheral vision focused on the road, and saw that it was her boyfriend, Jonah. After a brief moment of hesitation, she quickly accepted the call, hurrying to put it on speaker.

“How’s the drive going?” emanated from the phone.

“It's going fine, I’m only around twenty minutes off from the house,” She replied.

“You know, I still haven’t met your twin,” Jonah said.

“I don’t know if you want to. As much as I love her, she’s kind of a mess,” Rose said dryly, trying her best to mask her feelings under the veneer of humor. It was true, after all. Ever since they had first reached adulthood, Rose always felt that she was the only one doing any real adulting. She was always the one looked at to guide Mary, and those expectations weighed far heavier than anyone in her family could’ve known. They were the same age, yet Rose had to play the part of the older sibling. Putting on the mask of confidence was not a foreign concept to her, but having to do it all the time when around her twin was beyond taxing. If anything, calling her twin a bit of a mess was sugarcoating it.

“Kind of a mess you say? I remember me and my brother used to fight all the time when we were younger, but we turned out fine,” Jonah replied

“Different kind of mess, babe,” Rose said, doing her best to not let on that she felt his comment was a little insensitive. 

“I know you mentioned her agoraphobia, but is it really that bad?” Jonah said, clearly not reading the room very well.

“Yes, it is ‘that bad’. I’m practically her caretaker nowadays. My parents kinda passed that onus onto me when they died. They would’ve wanted me to look after her,” Rose said sadly. She wished more than anything that her parents would come back, but some things were impossible. She would never forgive the drunk driver that crashed into them and killed them. She hadn’t touched a drop of alcohol since the incident, which was rather ironic given that her father used to own a small brewery back in his time. It wasn’t a fresh wound, but it was still a very painful one. 

“I’m sorry I asked that, genuinely. I know you don’t like talking about that sort of stuff, so I won’t bring it up again,” Jonah responded, trying to perform damage control.

“No, it’s fine. Just think before you say stuff like that,” Rose postured, feeling it was better to just let it go. This hadn’t been the first time Jonah had said some stupid shit, and it likely wouldn’t be the last. He was the type to just say whatever was on his mind, bereft of any filter. Rose both loved and hated him for that. On some days, she found it endearing, but on other days it was quite the opposite. It was pretty clear to Rose that he had lived a rather sheltered life, given his lack of care when it came to money and ineptitude at certain life skills, but she still put up with him. He was the only person she could really talk to, which nowadays she couldn’t even say about her own twin. 

“Do you want me to call you again when you’re on your way back?” Jonah said hesitantly in lieu of his previous mess-up.

“Sure, yeah,” Rose responded, maybe a little too absentmindedly. At that, Jonah hung up, leaving her with the road as her only company. As much as she appreciated the landscape, it was nice to have someone to talk to over the long drive, since the haze she found herself in could be potentially dangerous. Rose had heard of driver’s hypnosis, and had long reckoned with the fact that it happened to her fairly frequently, especially when on the road to the old family farm. She had almost crashed once on the way back, making her paranoid of the drive. She had somehow slipped into the opposite lane in her haze, nearly plowing into a logging truck. It was only the deep bass of the truck’s horn that saved her. Rose could only imagine the damage that her death would’ve wrought on her sister, as she certainly would’ve blamed herself for it. After all, Rose was the last scantling of a family that Mary had left.

The sea of green pastures gave way to golden cornfields as Rose found herself in familiar territory. No matter how much time passed, she would never forget the seemingly infinite yellow fields from her youth. She occasionally had nightmares about getting lost in those mazes in her childhood, and calling out for help only for no one to come. She would run through the corn for what felt like miles only to see more corridors of the vegetable. When she woke up, she would be covered in sweat no matter how cold it was on the farm property. Rose fondly remembered her parents comforting her, and even covering up her window at one point so that she wouldn’t have to see the neighboring cornfields. It was sweet of them to give her the time of day for such an irrational dream. Some would say it's the bare minimum to comfort a child after a nightmare, but many other parents in the area would do no such thing, thinking tough love was the best option. It was a miracle her parents had raised her and Mary in such a compassionate way, making it hurt all the more now that they were gone.

The town came into view much quicker than Rose expected, as always. It had a way of sneaking up on you, like a location in a dream, where you just find yourself plopped in the middle of it. As sad as it was to say, it was a dying town. People were moving out faster than new people were coming in, and even those who looked into the area didn’t consistently stick with it. Wooden skeletons of half-built houses acted as a testament to that, standing silently in the distance and looming over the dying tufts of tall grass. They would be torn down eventually, but it would take time given how out of the way this place was. Growing up in it made it seem much livelier, though perhaps that was only nostalgia talking. It could’ve always been this way, only Rose may have been too young to reckon with that. She could admit to herself when she misremembered things. After all, the funny thing about getting older is realizing the truth of how places actually are. There was a strong possibility that a century could pass and the town would be long gone, as though wiped out of existence. Then again, does it matter if something existed at all if no one can remember it?

As she approached the side road which led to the old farm-adjacent house Rose once called home, she decided to turn on the radio. She felt a need to draw her mind away from the thought spiral she had found herself in, switching channels until landing on 80’s classics. “Boys of Summer” started playing, a song Rose was quite familiar with. 

*Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach*

The path started to constrict, foliage pressing her into the center. It was a good thing not many drivers frequented it, as there was only room for one vehicle at a time.

*I feel it in the air, summer’s out of reach*

This was the song she would listen to with her mother in the car on long drives. Sometimes it was even on loop, but Rose would never care. She used to hate the drives, only recently realizing how much she missed them

*Empty lake, empty streets, sun goes down alone*

Finally, Rose broke from the wooded road and was now in full view of the farm, complete with the decrepit looking house that her twin resided in. If a place could have a soul, this settlement had long lost it. It was nothing more than a graveyard of memories now. Rose stopped the vehicle, taking a deep breath as she prepared herself to go inside.

*I’m driving by your house, though I know you’re not home.*
