I can remember a piercing ring from the kitchen radio. It stopped abruptly followed by a broadcasters voice, '*You will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister'.* These ominous words made my father lower his newspaper and my mother immediately stopped fussing over the dishes. 'I speak to you now from Ten Downing Street,' a grave voice stated. 'Over the course of last night, a major incident has occurred stemming from a home in Ferme Park Road in Crouch End, London, claiming the lives of 36 civilians and 20 men of service. The effect of this incident has spread throughout the Crouch End area and measures have been taken to evacuate civilians. Henceforth, a section of the North London area will be quarantined and a military presence will be held at its borders to safeguard London and its people. We have yet to understand the nature of this incident, but rest assured a global effort is in place to research and ameliorate its effects. In this time of uncertainty, have faith that your government is doing everything in its power to protect its people. With a heavy heart we will mourn those that have passed in this darkest of nights and with courage we shall prevail against the unknown.'

Of what little memories I have to cling to now, this I know, is the earliest. No matter how hard I try, pacing around this white, sterile cell I now reside in, I can only recollect events relating to that awful place. London’s glaring scar on its otherwise beautiful face, the exclusion zone. It took some adjustment, but eventually people became accustomed to seeing the forty foot concrete walls and the constant armed patrols. It was a reminder that there were still some things in this world we couldn’t comprehend, and there was an unspoken agreement that it was better to not dwell on it. So the years went by, the walls became a staple in the lives of Londoners, and yet we were no closer to understanding the events that put them there. Aerial footage showed nothing apart from a large, almost perfect circle of dead vegetation surrounding the epicentre of the zone. But apart from that there were no observable signs of activity. That’s why we were sent in. Me, along with with four men I’ve served with for years and a handful of scientists from across the world were sent to participate in the first manned expedition of the exclusion zone.

It seems funny now after everything that had happened, but on the drive from RAF Northolt to the zone, we were in good spirits. We were doing something that hadn’t been done before, and for a group of lifelong military men, this could very well have been the pinnacle of our careers.

I was driving the large Foxhound at the rear of the convoy, packed in with the rest of the military escort for the expedition. Beside me was Amar Sandhu, a Sikh field medic and my closest friend, with the patience of a saint and the bedside manners to match. Behind us in the rear passenger seats were Richard Ames, a true Scouser who never failed to lighten a conversation, and the stone-faced John Roland, a Glasgow man through and through. Ahead of us leading the charge was a canvas covered truck driven by Captain Edward Harpe, carrying all the expedition’s equipment and Doctors Olga Fillapova, Ian Schelberg and Michael Coolidge.

There was an atmosphere of subdued excitement in that vehicle, but as the shadow of those behemoth walls were cast over us, as those thick, rusted steel gates creaked open for the first time in thirty years, swallowing the truck ahead, that feeling was sucked out of us in an instant. What was left was a quiet dread, and an anticipation for an unforeseen threat lurking behind those walls, undisturbed until now.

Ghost towns aren’t anything new. There are countless pictures of buildings and roads reclaimed by nature after they’re discarded by their past inhabitants, so the sight of ivy covered walls and weeds bursting from asphalt didn’t surprise us as we finally rolled through those gates. What did send a cold shiver down my spine was the view of the walls interior from my wing mirror. At the base of the wall were piles of animal carcasses. Deep scratches covered the foot of the concrete palisade. In some spots, jutting from the mess of dull orange fox furs and withered rat tails, I could see the faint glint of name tags and collars. I was snapped out of any superstitious thoughts when I saw Olga’s head stick out of the truck’s window ahead of us to snap a photo of the animals. Rumours be damned we were there to do a job and I wouldn’t let my imagination get in the way of a mission.

We traversed a good distance down that cracked, unmaintained road when Amar finally broke the silence, ‘So friends, what do you think happened here.’

‘Gas,’ Richey replied, in an unapologetically confident tone. ‘Has to be lad. Gas line burst in the night, leaked into the air making people go crazy.’

‘Oh its always bloody gas with you,’ John said. ‘A car exploded while we’re in Bosnia, an active war zone, and *you* thought it was gas. It’s never gas.’

‘Alright, you tell me what it was then if you’re so smart,’ Richey replied.

‘Doesn’t matter what it was. That’s for them to figure out,’ John said, nodding towards the truck.

‘I’m afraid he’s right Amar,’ I said glancing to my left. ‘We’re the only ones here not paid to think. Probably better not to wonder about these things.’

Just as that enlightening conversation finished, we passed into the last of the remaining flora in the zone. In an instant, our surroundings changed from that of a lush urban forest to a dry wasteland. There were no more trees, no weeds, nothing to indicate we were in London instead of some abandoned gold rush town. The odd thing was that everything looked so *clean.* Like the entire area was perfectly frozen in a time long gone.

It didn’t take long in that place for my stomach to turn. At the time I reasoned it away as nerves, pushed it to the back of my mind and focused on the road ahead. It was this focus that made me notice it. Of all the near identical street lamps lining the road that we had passed so far, the one approaching the vehicle to the right was just a foot shorter than the rest. It was identical to its neighbours in every way except for the fact that it seemed to have sank into the footpath, tilting slightly forward.

‘How much longer do we have Lewis,’ Richey said, clearly looking uneasy in his seat. ‘I’m dying for a shit.’

That statement pulled my attention away from the road. I realised what started as a slight sinking feeling in my stomach had progressed into a full blown cramp. Like my insides were twisting into a knot, threatening to burst at any moment.

‘Sure it not just gas?’ John said quietly.

The two-way radio cracked to life and Captain Harpe’s voice came through, ‘EV-2 this is EV-1, prepare to make a brief stop. Dr. Fillipova and Dr. Schelberg need to take some readings,’ he paused for a moment. ‘And Dr. Coolidge is after getting sick.’

We pulled onto the hard shoulder and dispersed to go about our respective duties. Pulling out my binoculars, I scouted out the road ahead, seeing something peculiar in the dead centre. Half a car. More specifically its rear half, boot pointed to the sky.

Once soil sampled were collected and environmental readings were taken, we approached this oddity. As we got closer, it dawned on me that it wasn’t half a car, it was a full one, dipped head first into the road, merging seamlessly with the asphalt. A black, desiccated hand hung out of the rear passenger window. There were no cracks, no sinkholes, it was as if the car was dipped into a liquid road, filling the car, drowning its unfortunate driver, before drying and hardening around it. I approached with tentative confusion, Olga was absolutely beaming with curiosity. After taking a tissue sample from the late driver, she jogged around the back of the truck, rummaged through some crates, and produced a pill bottle. Distributing the capsules to the team, she explained that they were only taking probiotics and that she would prefer to wait until she had solid evidence before she explained her theory. I took the pill gladly, I would’ve taken anything at that point if it stopped the ceaseless churning in my stomach.

We turned off the main road and soon found ourselves in a quaint residential street. Red brick town houses lined the road, the affects of the phenomena evident wherever I looked. Emergency vehicles phased into one another, street bins lodged into the sides of buildings, three floors up. It was hard not to get whiplash, seeing these nonsensical scenes in the middle of an otherwise perfect snapshot of a quiet London neighbourhood in the 70’s.

Amar turned to me and spoke quietly, ‘You know why I asked that question earlier, Lewis?’

‘I don’t know, small talk?’ I replied.

‘No no my friend, it’s because I knew we were all trying not to think about it. Pushing it back into a dark place. I needed to ask that question to bring it to the light. We can’t go into this place fearing the shadows, our negative thoughts would only do harm. Believe what you will, but pushing further with confidence and positivity is the only way. Facing it head first.’

He was right of course, he always was.

We parked in front of a community centre on the street corner. This was to be our base of operations. I was busy pulling crates from the truck, carrying experimental equipment I could never hope to understand the purpose of, when I looked down the street facing me. A completely unassuming neighbourhood, and there tucked in a row of buildings identical to it, was the focal point of our mission. Number 32 Ferme Park Road, the epicentre of the phenomena. We would conduct a thorough search of it the next day, but for now I turned away and focused on the preparation work.

I was finishing setting up my cot on the polished linoleum floor when I grabbed the attention of Dr. Ian Schelberg. As a world renowned physicist and the lead researcher of the expedition, I was hoping he could shed some light on the vast array of antennas, cables and clunky machinery we had been setting up around the area that day. His answer was disappointing, and frankly made me question the point of the expedition.

‘If I’m being honest, no one really knows what to look for here. I have some theories but its grasping at straws at best. The goal here is to cast a very wide net, combining run of the mill environmental sensors with cutting edge equipment from the very fringe of experimental physics. And if we’re lucky we may catch something,’ he explained.

It wasn’t what I was hoping for, but to give him credit we were all starved of information. Whatever happened that night stopped that night, leaving no measurable evidence apart from the slowly growing dead zone.

That evening Amar cooked for us on a portable gas stove. We were sat in a small circle enjoying the meal when Olga approached with a concerned look. ‘Captain I suggest you mandate daily probiotics from now on,’ she stated.

We all looked up from our plates.

‘I inspected the tissue sample from the body we encountered. I also gave myself a mouth swab to double check, but…,’ she paused, not knowing how to possibly explain. ‘There was an unusually low amount of bacteria. What little I could see under the microscope was all moving in the same direction. I don’t think life around the epicentre is dying, I think it’s leaving.’

At that moment we were all visibly jarred, none more than Michael. ‘We can’t stay here,’ he blurted, rocking in his seat. ‘We’re messing with forces we can’t possibly comprehend.’

‘That’s enough Doctor,’ Captain Harpe responded. ‘It’s true we cant afford to delay the mission now, but we’re here for a reason. We’ll inspect the house tomorrow and get whatever data we can. At least we’ve set up a line of communication to the outside. I’ll update command and I suggest you all get a good nights rest.’

No rest came that night. The thought of being one of the first ones in that house tomorrow, accompanied with Michael's ceaseless tossing and mumbling kept me from sleep. Morning couldn’t come quick enough, but when it did I got dressed, packed my gear and prepared for the task ahead.

The first pass of the house was to be conducted by myself, Richey and John. We weren’t tasked with much, just to clear every corner, making sure there were no glaring hazards, anomalies or threats of any kind. I remember thinking the simplicity of the job was overstated. We were entering ground zero of a world famous disaster, hidden from view and left untouched for years, the unholiest of holies.

We suited up in thick, lead-lined hazmat suits, and entered the decontamination chamber we had set up in front of the door the previous day. Behind us were our team and the outside world, in front of us was a freshly painted door to the unknown, complete with a shiny brass knocker and the number thirty-two bolted to its centre.

We stood in dead silence, listening to the sharp hiss of chemicals spraying our suits. After a quick blast of air to dry us off and the ringing of a buzzer, the Captain’s voice came through our suits internal speakers, ‘You are clear to enter, good luck men.’

The air inside was heavy, all the curtains drawn so not one ray of light could shine in. Specks of dust floated by the beams of our rifles flash-lights as they scanned the interior. The house was immaculate, not a hair out of place, and it was still, so *still.* I couldn’t help feeling a twinge of nostalgia as I looked around the typical kitschy decor of a 1970’s family home. The thick, wood panelled television set, the nicotine stained wallpaper, the enormous grandfather clock, its hands frozen at eleven thirty. The living room and kitchen bore no signs of a struggle, none of the oddities seen throughout the zone and more importantly, no bodies.

‘Captain Harpe this is Lieutenant Mayfield,’ I radioed in. ‘Nothing unusual so far. Structure isn’t compromised and looks safe to enter.’

We split up to survey each room individually. I finished a thorough search of the kitchen and made my way to the main corridor to inspect the storage closet under the stairs. The door was wedged tight but after two hard pulls it swung open to reveal chipped wood steps leading into darkness. While unusual for houses in this area to have basements, it wasn’t completely unheard of. The strange part came when I instinctively tugged on the pull cord to my left and the room illuminated.

‘Captain, is this house still connected to the grid?’ I asked.

‘Shouldn’t be. The whole area was cut off before the wall went up. What did you find?’, Captain Harpe answered.

‘The lighting in the basement still works.’

‘Not the worst problem to have. Probably a separate battery powered circuit. We’ve noted it down, continue your search Lieutenant.’

I took it slow, carefully testing my weight on each step before descending to the next. Halfway down, I saw a shadeless bulb, hanging from a concrete ceiling, spilling light onto a grey and featureless room. In the centre was a lopsided T-shaped cardboard box fort, plastered with scotch tape and decorated with crayon depictions of flowers and princesses. Apart from a few blankets and pillows, the little palace was empty. Still, something about it irked me, like this muted dungeon was no place for an artefact of childhood innocence. I shook off the feeling and told Richey and John to rendezvous at the front door to before letting the scientists in.

Much like us, the scientists couldn’t find anything of significance. What was to be the focal point of the expedition turned up nothing of use, and we were left feeling dejected and increasingly worried for our health. We tried to eat that night, but we couldn’t keep any food down. To avoid further deterioration, Captain Harpe told us that the mission would be cut short after two more days of exploration.

The reaction in the room was mixed. Myself, Amar, Richey and John breathed a sigh of relieve. We were tired of the cramps and uncanny atmosphere in the zone, its end couldn’t come sooner. Olga and Ian on the other hand were in disbelief.

‘How could you give up so soon Captain?’, Olga said. ‘We're no closer to understanding this place than before the expedition. We need a more thorough look at the epicentre. We need more samples, more time. We’ve found nothing.’

Michael straightened in his seat, his shaking leg finally becoming still. ‘Oh I’ve found something,’ he cried. ‘The exact thing I was sent on this fools errand for. I’ve found the demons your generals were hoping for,’ he pointed a finger at Captain Harpe. ‘Voices. All crying, all screaming out from a swirling reservoir of souls deep, deep below that cursed house. That idiot girl found something she shouldn’t have, and now we pay the price.’

Throughout this tirade he grew more and more agitated, pacing back and forth, gesticulating violently.

‘ENOUGH,’ Captain Harpe shouted.

Michael didn’t comply, instead moving closer to the Captain, his voice grew to a crazed shout. ‘Tell them Captain, tell them why I’m here.’

‘SIT DOWN MICHAEL, THAT’S AN ORDER.’

When the Captain gave this command, Michael swung, his fist connecting with the Captain’s jaw, springing me and the rest of the security escort into action. We closed the gap across the room and dog piled Michael, quickly tying his arms behind his back and dragging him away from the rest of the group. We eventually gagged him in response to the endless incoherent wailing. When the dust settled, and our breathing slowed, our panic turned to suspicion.

‘Captain, what did he mean tell us why he’s here?’, Ian asked.

Captain Harpe looked down, closed his eyes, and with a deep sigh said, ‘I knew there would be questions. I didn’t like the idea, but the higher-ups were adamant. Michael is a theologist, not a meteorologist like you were told. He was sent to determine if the phenomena was of a… supernatural nature.’

‘You can’t be serious,’ Olga scoffed. ‘Years of research, millions in funding, and your government taints it with this nonsense. This spits in the face of everything me and Ian have been doing here.’

‘I didn’t like it either, honest to God. This doesn’t change anything and we all still have a job to do. It was more of an afterthought,’ the Captain replied.

For a tense minute, we all stood in that dimly lit community centre hall. The scientists still wore a mild look of resentment. The rest of us tried to hide our concern, either spurned on by the revelation of Michael’s true mission brief or by simply questioning the salvageability of the expedition.

I don’t think any of us saw him creep up behind Captain Harpe. One minute, he was tied up in the corner of the room, the next he was behind the Captain, unholstering his sidearm and sending a bullet ripping through the back of his neck at point blank range. From the searing pain in our ears to the blood stinging our eyes, we didn’t have time to react. Before we could draw our weapons, Michael had hooked two fingers deep into the Captain’s eye sockets and dragged him at an inhuman speed, down the street and straight towards number thirty-two.

We sprinted down the road trying to catch Michael, but in an instant he had passed the threshold of number thirty-two and the door slammed shut in front of us. I was second in command, but in that moment a coherent thought couldn’t reach me. It had happened so fast, within minutes the whole expedition collapsed in a way none of us could’ve imagined.

Amar turned to me then, ‘Lewis, you need to make a decision.’

His voice pulled me from my stupor. I looked around to see that the whole expedition team accompanied me in my pursuit. ‘Amar, you and Richey stay with Ian and Olga. Don’t move until you hear from me. John suit up and help me get Michael,’ I ordered.

We practically jumped into our suits, two feet first, zipped up each others backs and ran through the plastic chamber, skipping the decontamination protocol.

The house was even darker than before. The wallpaper was peeling, furniture lay splintered on the floor, a thick coating of dust over the wreckage. The trail of blood leading from the front door had branched off, snaking its way into every room, up every wall and the ceiling. We followed each path the blood took.

I remember walking through the living room and seeing a faint wisp of smoke rising from the ashtray, disappearing just as I turned my head to focus on it. Waving my hand over it, I felt its warmth for a brief moment. I proceeded into the kitchen and was hit with the stench of rotting fruit and spoiled milk, but, like the cigarette smoked thirty years ago, the smell alluded me as soon as I noticed it. In some small way those feelings were still there, existing in a plane separate to ours, not picked up by any senses, but by a place deep in the back of my mind.

‘Lewis this place isn’t right,’ John said walking up next to me in the grimy kitchen.

‘I know, but we need to find Michael before we leave,’ I responded.

‘And Edward, we can’t leave him here,’ John said, his voice sounding distant.

‘We’ll get the Captain out too John don’t worry.’

There was one last place to look. The cold cement basement and its cardboard centrepiece. I dreaded the thought of going down there, looking into that box fort and seeing Michael’s face glaring at me between the blankets and pillows.

If only that was all that awaited me.

I pulled open the door, it was noticeably looser this time. I once again instinctively pulled on the cord to my left, only this time the lights wouldn’t come on, and we were left to navigate down the uneven steps, guided only by our flashlights. Our lights scanned over the room, revealing old water-stained cardboard and cracked cement.

As John approached the fort, two sets of arms shot out of the entrance, one set digging its fingers in between the knuckles of the other, controlling its each digit in jerking, spastic movements. I’d like nothing more than to think I warned John, called out, or screamed, or fired, but I’m not so sure I did anything at all. In reality I stood rooted to the floor, speechless at the sight if Michael clinging to the back of Captain Harpe’s corpse, manipulating his limbs, whispering into the Captains ear...and the Captain whispering back.

This amalgamation of the two rushed out of their cardboard hiding place. The Captain’s teeth sank into Johns neck causing him to slump back against the wall, his hand covering the wound. The creature turned its two heads to me and pounced before I could react. It pinned me down and two sets of eyes stared deep into mine, one set was bloody and mashed, the other wide with a strange mix of fear and elation.

Their gaze sent me tumbling down an abyss, the sights and sounds of the basement growing more and more distant the further I fell. The last thing I remember was hearing my own voice in a far off place, telling Amar to bring the rest of the group into the house.

I don’t know how long I was in that condition for. It felt like I was plummeting downwards, through a maelstrom of countless thoughts and emotions, most of which were not my own.

I jolted awake. Finding myself in pitch darkness, laying on a large bed. The air felt damp and I was surrounded by the acrid smell of sweat. After spending what felt like eternity in a senseless void, the odour hit me like a freight train and I tried hard not to vomit.

For better or for worse, I needed to see my surroundings if I had any hope of understanding where I was. Neither my rifle nor sidearm was with me. I frisked myself, fumbling through every pouch and eventually retrieved an emergency glow stick. I cracked it, letting the room be slowly blanketed in a dim green haze and clipped it to my chest.

It was the master bedroom. The bed I had just been laying on bore a large dark stain on its centre. Clothes were strewn on the floor, ripped and clearly worn.

I crept out of the bedroom and onto the upstairs landing. I peaked into the bathroom and immediately gagged at the sight and smell of the toilet. The plumbing had been shut off a long time ago yet it was clear someone was living here, using the toilet. I quickly shut the door but I found no respite from the smell. It seemed every corner of the house had its own distinct yet equally horrific scent; The damp mugginess of the bedroom, the mountain of faecal matter in the bathroom, and a deeply disturbing smell of rotting meat reaching me from downstairs.

A faint muttering below me focused my thoughts away from the stench. My whole body stiffened as I tried to identify the sound. The words were frantic and repetitive, but what language it was, I couldn’t tell. Deciding to investigate, I placed one foot down the stairs. The step creaked, almost deafening in the house’s oppressive silence. The muttering stopped.

‘Is someone there? Show yourself,’ Amar’s voice croaked from downstairs.

‘Amar, is that you?’ I replied. His voice was almost unrecognisable, tired yet manic.

I hurried down the rest of the steps and Amar’s face came into view under the glow stick’s light. His beard was damp and unkempt, his eyes sunken and glassy. He shed his uniform and was now wearing what I assumed were clothes he had found in the house, equally as dishevelled and stained as the ones I had seen in the bedroom. The only thing that seemed in relative order was his turban.

‘Lewis. My God Lewis how… is that really you?’ Amar asked, his voice trembling, his eyes flooding with tears.

I couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. What had I missed when I was knocked out?

‘Yes Amar, yes its me. What happened? Where’s Richey and John. Where’re the scientists?’

He fell to the floor and began sobbing when I asked this. I pulled him to his feet and attempted to snap him out of his hysteria. I wish now that I had just let him grieve, to find some emotional outlet amidst the chaos.

‘So long. I’ve been here for so long. We’re trapped Lewis. The house won’t let us leave,’ Amar cried.

I ran to the front door, pulling, kicking. It was no use. The door gave no hint of opening. I turned to Amar, his back now to the kitchen door. ‘There’s no way out Lewis. I tried everything,’ he said.

‘What do you mean there’s no way out?’, I shouted back, resentful of Amar’s supposed apathy towards our situation. ‘How long have you been here for?’.

‘Months maybe. It’s hard to tell’, Amar replied. ‘Doors are sealed, windows too. We couldn’t smash them. The outside, Lewis, there’s nothing outside. When the flashlights had batteries we could find our way around the house, but when we shone them out the windows...nothing.’

‘What do you mean “we”, Amar? Are the others here too?’

He reeled back at the question, back firmly against the kitchen door, his arms spread to block my entry.

‘No no no no no’, he repeated, his head shaking from left to right so quickly I thought he’d snap his stick thin, emaciated neck.

‘Amar… what’s in the kitchen?’ I asked cautiously. My question stopped his maniacal protest and his gaze bore into me. In that hallway, under the glow stick's hue, Amar resembled nothing of the man I once knew and admired.

‘We needed you Lewis. We were lost, trapped, confused, and we needed YOU. And only now you decide to show yourself.’ As he was talking, he drew a knife from the back of his waistband. He lunged at me. God he was so light, so frail. I dodged the knife with ease and threw him to the ground, cringing at the sound his joints made as they hit the wood floor. I kicked the knife away and shouldered through the kitchen door as he lay gasping for breath.

Of all the memories I no longer possess, why does this one have to remain perfectly clear? They were my brothers, people I served with for years and would protect with my life. I saw their decayed, butchered remains lying there in the kitchen. Only recognisable by their dog tags and neatly folded uniforms on the counter.

I walked to the counter and pocketed the two dog tags. Amar limped into the kitchen, his face contorted, tears streaming into his filthy beard. ‘You have no idea what we’ve been through. John was already dying when we found ourselves here. That thing wearing Michael’s skin severed his carotid artery. We didn’t want to, I swear to you we tried for so long not to. The days and weeks blended together in this darkness until our only sense of time came from the pain in our stomachs. Then Richey, he tried to escape. I kept telling him that a fate worse than ours awaited him down there but he persisted. I killed him so he wouldn’t go down there. I saved him, Lewis.’

I think deep down I knew what he was talking about. I could feel it ever since waking up in this place. A tugging in the back of my mind. A gentle pull towards the basement.

‘Amar, I have to leave’.

I tried to sound as gentle as I could. I no longer knew what the man across from me was capable of. He was practically a bag of bones, but unpredictable. He stood swaying in the kitchen doorway, nearly unable to support his own weight.

‘I have to go down there, we both do. We can’t stay here forever, you of all people should know that.’ I said in the most disarming tone I could muster.

Amar kept swaying, shaking his head slightly as he pondered my statement.

‘I have done horrible things Lewis. I’ve killed my friend, consumed his flesh and doomed myself to a wretched life in perpetual darkness. All because I alone know what awaits us if we go deeper. Its evil, Lewis. An evil that dwarfs my misdeeds. I can’t let you go down there.’

He closed the gap in an instant, jumping on me and slamming me to the floor with a strength I didn’t know any human could possess, let alone this starved and withered prisoner.

I managed to move my leg past his hips and kicked upwards as hard as I could. Amar reeled back, blood and rotted teeth spilling from his mouth. I scrambled to my feet, half sprinting, half stumbling out of the kitchen to the basement door. As I swung the door open Amar grabbed my ankle in a vice grip, sending both of us tumbling down the basement stairs.

I landed hard on my shoulder, and felt the joint pop out of place. Amar fell directly on his face, his cheekbone meeting the concrete floor with a wet crunch. I didn’t pause for a second and crawled towards the opening of the box fort with one arm, the other dragging uselessly on the ground.

At the far end of the cardboard tunnel, I spotted a hole, a ring of frayed cardboard surrounding a black abyss. I squeezed further in, the old dry cardboard burning my elbows. I chanced one look behind me, seeing Amar’s broken and bloody face staring back, before tipping forward head first into the hole.

I can’t recall how long I was falling for, all I remember was the sting of the rough concrete tearing through my uniform, the dull ache left behind after hitting against the occasional piece of wayward rebar. I thought that I’d eventually fall deep enough to reach dirt or even some natural stone, but the house’s foundation just kept stretching downwards. At some point during my endless descent I let my mind drift, thoughtless and at peace. I barely registered that I was no longer falling, but was now being constricted on all sides by the the tunnel, the space behind me narrowing, the space in front widening, squeezing me further down the concrete oesophagus.

As the tunnel tightened around my chest, leaving me gasping for air, I wept. Not for myself, but for Amar. I wished I did more for him. I should’ve killed him, granting him an escape before I crawled into my own claustrophobic prison. But instead I permitted him to suffer, dooming him to wither away in that dark house alone with nothing but the stripped corpses of his friends accompany him in his final hours. My remorseful thoughts gradually faded into sweet unconsciousness and when I awoke I was once again in the master bedroom of number thirty-two Ferme Park Road.

As I’d come to expect, the house’s appearance was once again altered from its last incarnation. I think my time spent in that strange place gave me some intimate, subconscious knowledge of its nature, because as I surveyed my new surroundings, limping out of the bedroom, I knew that this was its true form. The previous houses just after images formed by its journey to where it was now.

The borders distinguishing objects from their neighbours seemed to blend together, their colours shifting ever so slightly, almost like the construction I now walked through was not firmly set in the material world, but rebuilt from numerous contradictory memories of the place. A humming rippled through the air with no discernible source and the faint smell of ozone lingered in my nose.

With every step a different voice penetrated my mind.

*Weathers supposed to be good today.*

I walked down the steps, gripping the banister.

*Stick on the kettle would you?.*

Every surface I touched sent a warm vibration through me.

*Mummy why did we have to move?.*

The couch in the living room constantly shifted places, unsure if it was facing the fireplace or the television.

*Why don’t you play in the basement while I get dinner ready, I left some boxes there for you.*

*Play in the basement.*

*Basement.*

I was moving on auto-pilot, nudged along either by an unseen force or my own morbid curiosity. I took my time going down the basement steps, careful not to trip on their ever-changing geometry. What I found down there was not a series of boxes crudely taped together, but the source of the intrusive voices. A mound of writhing flesh pulsated in the centre of the basement, dotted with orifices that would open, spew out a strangers memory in a strangers voice, before closing back up. Standing beside it, amidst a heap of frantically written notes and sketches, were Olga and Ian.

‘How fitting of you to join us at the conclusion of our research,’ Ian said, unfazed at my entrance.

‘I thought you two were dead,’ I finally said, overcoming my paralysing shock.

‘Oh no, we’ve just been here for quite some time, studying,’ Ian replied.

‘Learning,’ Olga added.

‘How did you get here? I thought I was the only one left,’ I gasped.

‘Same as you I think, we needed to know more. That drive led us here.’ Olga explained.

They moved from their position and began pacing around me.

‘Like an object in orbit, it’s either close enough to eventually be pulled in, succumbing to the effects of gravity,’ Ian explained.

‘Or it is far enough for it to get flung away,’ Olga continued.

Their movements and speech were perfectly synchronised, each sentence they started was finished by the other, in an almost rehearsed fashion.

‘So we were pulled in, and we listened. To many voices and even more experiences. The girl was our favourite,’ Olga said.

‘A girl who saw the most amazing thing in her little make-shift home in the basement,’ Ian cooed. ‘A thing not of this world, a thing that while only intruding into this plane for not even a nanosecond, left a shadow scorched onto the universe.’

‘I’m sure you’ve felt its effects Lewis. Thought…’

‘Material. The boundaries between the two now inconsequential. Flowing freely, unhindered by the limits of our reality.’

They completed their lap around me, meeting in the middle and combining like two drops of oil floating on water, before splitting off and resuming their pacing.

‘All of those lucky enough to be drawn in, now reside here.’

‘Their respective minds contributing to a well of sentience.’

‘We still have so much to learn from it’

‘You can join us.’

‘Or you can keep fighting it, and dig deeper.’

‘Journey past infinity and see where you end up.’

As they said this, they joined hands and stepped into the mass of flesh, merging seamlessly with the monstrosity. I was frozen in place, battling not only with my incomprehensible experiences but the mental barrage of countless minds probing their way into my own. With all the strength I could muster, I forced myself to look around the room, hopelessly searching for a way out, and there, tucked between folds of skin and hair, was a small opening, in the exact same position as my previous escape route.

I was broken, mentally and physically. My limbs were weak, my flesh was bruised and my thoughts still in a far away place, doing their best to not register the absurdity of the situation. So, with nothing left to lose, I slipped one foot in, then the other, feeling the opening pucker around my shins and pull me in.

I think it was here that my mind was truly broken. The voices were a cacophony of screaming, actively trying to pry their way into my psyche. I sank further down the tunnel of flesh with my eyes tightly shut, the voices growing more and more demanding, commanding me to join them. I couldn’t. No matter how badly I wanted this torment to end I just couldn’t let them in. The shared experiences of countless victims shot through my brain. Memories that I never had, lifetimes that I never lived passed by as if they were my own. I spent an eternity in that prison of skin, flesh and bone, and somewhere along the way I discarded what was left of my mind in a feeble attempt to survive.

When I opened my eyes and found that I was once again in the master bedroom, I cried out in agony, thinking that my punishment was not yet over and instead moving onto an even more horrific stage. But something was different this time around. Streaks of sunlight flooded through the curtains and I was met with the smell of fresh air. There was no bed, no furniture at all, except for the occasional step ladder or tool box. I timidly walked through the house, although I encountered nothing out of the ordinary. Sheets of cloth were draped over the wooden floors and patches of fresh paint covered the bare walls. I shuffled to the front door and my heart skipped a beat as I undid the latch and the door opened freely.

I wandered through the streets with the crook of my elbow blocking the sun from my eyes. After some time I must have raised suspicions because I was eventually brought to the institution I now call home. I don't think what I experienced was the result of malicious intent. That thing was neither good nor evil, it simply existed, giving no heed to lifeforms like me, whose plane of existence were leagues below its own.

I’m not quite sure why I’m writing this all down. I think in some way it memorialises my team members, even if this place has no memory of an exclusion zone in North London or of any catastrophe that occurred here. There’s an orderly here who has always been kind to me, I think I’ll give these scraps of paper to her, I trust she’ll know what to do with them.
