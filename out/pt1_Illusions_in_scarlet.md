High school has been a living hell for me. I've always been an introverted kinda guy, not many friends either. My name is Milo, an eleventh-grade student. Earlier this year, I happened to fall for Isla. She was a senior, a striking ginger with the most enchanting blue eyes and a figure that left me breathless.

From the moment I first laid eyes on her, I was captivated. Isla possessed a magnetic charm, it's safe to say I was surprised when I found out she didn't have a boyfriend. There was however, this one boy in my class, Stanley, who bragged about making out with Isla a bunch of times. I've never seen them together though, and he changed schools a while back, so I'm not that concerned.

I found myself watching Isla a lot, observing her every move, desperate for her to notice me in return. You might think I was being a bit creepy, and I won't even deny it. But oh boy, she was hot.

Isla was the definition of confident, effortlessly making her way through social circles and getting attention wherever she went. I was utterly captivated by her. But she remained unattainable for an average and unpopular guy like me, just... seemingly unaware of my existence. I yearned for her to acknowledge me, to see beyond my invisible presence and recognize the intense admiration I felt.

But as the weeks passed without any signs of attention from her, she remained constantly on my mind, and with the fear of someone else asking her out on Valentine's Day, especially Stanley, I eventually built up the confidence to ask her out. So one day, while we were heading home from school, I approached her. I was overcome with nerves, feeling my heart pounding in my chest and my cheeks turning warm, as she turned to look at me with those piercing eyes, gleaming with a mix of surprise and something... kinda unsettling.

"What do you want?" she asked, her voice laced with a hint of annoyance.

My words stumbled as I tried to express my feelings, to convey the depth of my affection. But Isla's response was not what I had hoped for. She laughed, a cold sound that echoed through the empty hallway.

"You think I would ever be interested in someone like YOU?" she mocked, her gaze narrowing with a venomous intensity. "You're nothing but a pathetic admirer, a mere shadow in my world."

Her words struck me like a dagger,  my heart shattering with a pain I had never known. All those months of admiration culminated in a harsh rejection that unfolded in under a minute. I felt a wave of humiliation and anger wash over me.

"I-I'm sorry," I stammered, my voice trembling with a mix of hurt and confusion.

Isla's eyes bore into mine, her expression twisting with a dangerous glimmer. "You should be sorry," she affirmed, smugly. "But if you dare speak of this encounter to anyone, I'll make your life a living hell." 

I didn't quite comprehend why she was so upset with me, so I stood there, contemplating how absurd the situation was becoming. Meanwhile, Isla grew increasingly solemn on the other side, reaching for her phone. Assuming she was gwtting back to ignoring my presence, I began to walk away when, suddenly, I felt a tug on my shirt. She locked eyes with me, displaying something on her phone.It took me only a moment to realize that what I was witnessing was a photograph of someone's decapitated head.

Fear gripped me as her threat had now sank in. I retreated, my heart shattered and my soul scarred by the realization that the object of my affection was not the person I had believed her to be. 

As I was walking away, my heart raced. I couldn't help but look back all the time to make sure she wasn't right there, ready to attack. I could hear her laughing at me. But I couldn't help but wonder if Isla was responsible for this gruesome act. Was I being dragged into a world of violence, just for being in love? Questions swirled in my mind, but one thing became clear: I wasn't rejected. I was saved.
