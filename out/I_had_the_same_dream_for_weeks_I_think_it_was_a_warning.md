Hi. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I’m not sure where else to go. I need help. Maybe a reality check. Anything but getting ignored by the cops again. I won’t share details here (or any actual names), but I had to move to Michigan for my own safety a few months ago.



I wish I could say it worked. 



My therapist had put me on this new medication to curb my night terrors. I kept a journal of my dreams and symptoms for her, and they got strange. 



I think the truth of what happened to me in Michigan is there. I just need help finding it.

**August 29th**



I didn’t have the Aaron dream last night. That’s the first time since I left Seattle that I haven’t woken up screaming. It feels weird getting a full night’s sleep, honestly. I guess you only realize how bad you had it once things go back to normal. Is that a symptom of anything? Or just part of being human?



I know you told me to send you my dreams, but I honestly don’t remember dreaming at all last night. I don’t even remember getting up once – I just took the pill and slept like a baby. That’s why I’m so relieved, I guess. But I’m sure it makes helping me unpack all this shit harder. Sorry. 



**August 30th**



I remembered my dream! Most of it, anyways. There’s a lake near my new place, and I was there. Or I was at a lake just like it. It's fuzzy. I’m sorry.



I remember feeling the air cool down the closer to the water I got. The air was so fresh, like pine with a hint of silt. I could see my new-old house (or one just like it) up on the hill. The lights were on, and as the sun left the horizon they grew brighter and brighter.



I woke up feeling safe --  really safe, like things would get better and were getting better every second. I hope that’s true.



**September 3rd**



Sorry, I’m really sorry, I promised you I’d write every day. I just got busy with work and finally painting the bedroom. I went with a sky blue – bye bye, goose-shit green. 



If it makes up for anything, I had a weird dream.



I was in bed, curled up on my side. You know how your body falls asleep first and then gently takes your brain with it? I was right there- my body heavy, my thoughts getting harder to string together. Warm. Dark. Home.



But as I was juuuust closing my eyes, cold air tickled the back of my neck. Pine-scented, with a hint of silt. The cold was pressing against each little divot in my spine, one by one. Like gentle, teasing fingers. 



It was quiet, except for some faint sloshing- the rhythmic ebbing like the heavy footfalls of some approaching creature. Brackish water lapped at the soles of my feet, the curve of my back, my shoulders. I started to panic. I couldn’t move my body, couldn’t get away.



But though the water rose, it never went any further over me. It was like I was a dam, holding an entire lake back with just my shoulder blades. Cold air ghosted over my body like a whisper.



I woke up after that. I had freezing pins and needles all over my back and shoulders, everywhere the water touched. 



I’ll try not to read into it. I know you said that can make my anxiety worse. But have you ever heard of something like this? Is it another side effect of these new meds, or am I just crazy?



**September 6th**



I’ve had that same dream the past few days – It starts with me falling asleep, too drowsy to focus on my worries. Heavy brain, heavy body, heavy water. At first it was at my back, then my chest. Last night it swallowed me up to my neck. 



That pins-and-needles sensation woke me up again, right as dawn started creeping in through the slats of the blinds. Even after the tingling went away, I still felt cold from the neck down.



Something feels wrong. I feel like the water's alive, somehow. Sentient. Like it knows what it's doing and enjoys it. 



I’ve been walking around the lake most days when I get off of work. I think I’ll stop and see if that makes the dreams go away.



**September 10th**



My college Psych teacher told us that dreams are how the brain filters information and gets rid of anything it doesn’t need. Water-cooler chats, the smell of fresh-cut grass and the sun glinting off a vape shop’s windows get wrung out like excess water from a dishcloth.



Not sure if that’s true. You’re the psychiatrist, you’d know better. But if it is true, then wouldn’t I have recurring dreams of things that actually happened? 



Why do I keep coming to the lake?



**September 13th**



I haven’t dreamt of anything else. I’ve barely THOUGHT about anything else. Just murky water, lake muck and damp pine needles. 



It went past my ears last night. Frigid water filled my ear canals, curling and nudging at my eardrums, looking for a way past. The room got smaller- I could barely see past the rippling waves, could barely keep my eyes open with the awful feeling of its cold tendrils sluicing behind my eyes. Could barely hear anything but the tide, the pulsing, my heartbeat.



And something else. It was muffled, refracted by the water, but strangely familiar. Like a deep-sea whale call, or a distant bird.



My ex said he was a lucid dreamer. It was his fun icebreaker he told on double dates and happy hours – he would find himself in a strange dream world and, after pushing at its seams, he’d realize that he was in full control of it and do whatever he wanted. 



He said he could teach me how to do it, but never tried. He liked knowing more than me.



I thought about him a lot then, his face half-remembered and blurry in my dreaming mind, as I tried to command that noise to become clearer. 



*….eeee...aaaaaa…uuuuuu…*



I’d heard it before, I knew I had. But where?



*…eeeaaa…uuuu…iiii….uuu…llll*



Was it getting closer?



*Buhhheeeeeaaaauuu….iii…uhlll….*



A person’s voice?



*“Beaaaauuuuutiiiiifffuuulllll…”*



Like a railroad spike to the eye.



That word, of all words, the one he turned into poison.



*Beautiful.*



My chest got tight with panic, made worse by the awful pressure of all that water, sinking me down into the dark.



No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t swim up.



I screamed, the sound bubbling through my waterlogged eardrums, my heavy body, and I woke up in a puddle of sweat.



I put deadbolts on my doors today. If I could figure out how to put them on my windows, I’d put locks there too. 



I know I’m being crazy. I know it was just a dream, my brain filtering information- the nearby lake, the past, the fear.



*“Beautiful…”*



I don’t care. I’m going to check my locks three extra times before I leave the house and before I go to bed. I’m not leaving anything unlocked. Not ever again. 



**September 16th**



Things haven’t gotten any better. I’m safe, I’m sure I am, but my mind isn’t. 



I test the doorknobs *one, two, three, four* times and nothing stops the water rising each night.



I closed my blinds on the lake-facing side of my house and I’m up past my lips now. I’m trying all the grounding exercises you showed me, I’m taking a pill and a half to get myself drowsy enough to stop spiraling, but I don’t know if it’s just making things worse.



I can feel the lakebed silt swirling below me. Sometimes it grazes the tips of my toes, tugging at me. Trying to get a good grip so it can pull me all the way under, paralyzed and helpless.



My tongue feels like a bloated slug in my mouth, fat and bitter with the taste of the lakebed. I hope it’s from the pills but I’m not convinced. 



Maybe I need a sleep test. Maybe I need to up our sessions. I don’t know if getting good sleep is worth all this. I don't know what to do.

  


**September 24th**



It goes past my nose and I wake up gasping and coughing for breath, my lungs burning. My body is still heavy, so heavy, even when I wake up alone and dry on my bed. Everything but the very top of my head is chilled and numb.



It’s getting higher. It’s hurting me now and it keeps getting higher. I feel its cold fanning on my eyeballs.



I’m sorry I missed our session. I just don’t want to drive past the lake. I’m sure you understand.



**September 28th**



It’s leaving marks on me. Little folds and rippling lines like waves pressing on my skin. I went to press on them once I woke up, and I could barely move my arms. 



I *know* it has to be the lake. My trash bags aren’t opened, my bathroom window isn’t smudged-up, I check the locks four times each and I’m nine states over. I didn’t post about the move anywhere he could see. No one knows that I’m here.



I’m supposed to be safe here. 



**September 29th**



It’s almost fully taken me. I spent hours stuck in my own mind.



The water has most of my vision, cold and prying. A soaking tongue tracing the bottom half of my pupil.



I strained my eyes to look into the depths. Shapes twisted against each other like a canyon of writhing snakes.



My vision blurred and multiplied as I tried to make sense of them.



The water swelled in response…



**September 30th**



There is someone at the bottom of the lake. 



The water is up past my eyes and there is someone at the bottom of the lake. I can SEE them, right there, a blurry shape standing upright on the lakebed like the water tension doesn't even exist. 



Like a dead body waiting at the bottom of the world. 



Waiting for me.



I woke up pressed into the mattress. Literally pressed- when I finally regained feeling in my body and rolled over, hands had left craters in the mattress topper like a great weight was pressing them down. 



Maybe they weren’t from *my* hands.



**October 1st**



I’m really sorry, Dr. Heather. I don’t think I can take it anymore. I have to stop taking the meds. I know you said the dreams will even out, but I can’t keep living like this.



Maybe I’m stupid for stopping them, or maybe I’m stupid for not stopping them sooner. Maybe it is just an awful side effect and we’ll laugh all about it at my next appointment.



And if it isn’t, then I need to hope I can stop this myself.



**October 2nd, after the police left**



I’m sorry if my handwriting is hard to read. I can’t stop shaking.



I didn’t take my meds. I didn’t take them and maybe that was what did it. 



I was so happy when the dream began because I could move. I thought about Aaron and felt like I’d shown him. He always made me feel helpless, and here I thought I was proving him wrong.



I’m so stupid. I’m so fucking stupid. 



I let the water take me, at first. I sank effortlessly, silt curling at my feet as the water pressed me down, right to where the body in the water waited for me. I was going to face it, finally. I had to.



*“B……..euuuuuu…”* the water echoed, all around me, deep in my ear canal, my soul.



*Shut up,* I thought back.



*“Beeeeeaaaaauuuuuuuu…”*



I could tell the body was looking at me, even though it didn’t have eyes. 

The further I sank, the louder the voice became.



My feet met the lakebed. I tried to take in the body, really make sense of it.



It tilted the blurry mud-smudge that was its head, raised a nondescript arm to stroke my cheek. 



Mud. Just mud. It was just mud, easy to grasp, easy to scatter…



“Beautiful…”



I dug my nails as hard as I could into its face, carving the vague impression of a cheek out of its murky head. 



Its pained scream was a muffled echo, all around me and somehow worlds away at the same time. Then louder, louder-



I woke up sweaty, like I’d been sleeping under a radiator.



Why was I so warm?



I groaned, kicking off my damp comforter, leaning into the relieving breeze coming from the window. 



The window. 



Dr. Heather, I didn’t leave my window open last night. 



I was scrambling then, groping around my night stand like my life depended on it, desperate to feel for the lamp switch.



I flicked it on and lit up my room, my bed, my quickly-cooling body and my shaking hands. 



Blood.



*There was blood under my fingernails.* 



I checked myself for scratches, for any wounds before I fully spiraled into a panic attack. I was completely unhurt, which meant-



That was when I saw the trail. A splotch here, a drop there. 



Not mine.



I didn’t need to follow it. I already knew where it led.



Right out my bedroom window. 

  


—



Even just typing out what I wrote is making me a little sick. 



I called the cops right after I noticed the blood. By the time they left, it was dark-brown and flaking out from under my nails. I washed my hands until they were bloody. 



I showed them everything, of course. I told them about my ex, about the dreams. They looked at me like I was crazy the second I broke out the journal, but they watched my house for a week. 



After that, they dropped the case. Warned me to get security cameras, as if people can’t leak their footage, and said to call back if ‘my boyfriend showed up again to argue.’



I moved out a month later. I’m not saying where I went. I haven’t even told my parents. I’m terrified he could find out. 



I can’t even show my therapist this, I had to stop seeing her once I moved and even then she only talked about it in the past tense. 



But it isn’t over.



I’ve started dreaming about the lake again.



I need you to help me, please. If I can get a few other people, even just one other person, to see what I see in these dreams, maybe the police will believe me. Maybe they’ll put him in prison.



I have to hope they will. 



Because this time, if I sink too far, I don’t think he’ll let me resurface.
