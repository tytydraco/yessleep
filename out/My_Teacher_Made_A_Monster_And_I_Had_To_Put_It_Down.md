[PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i3nw40/my_teacher_is_definitely_a_seral_killer/)

I feel like it kind of spoils the ending, me even posting to begin with.

Previously on the "My Teacher Is A Killer" Arc, I had been cornered by a horrific abomination that had just slaughtered Dr. Fine and presumably Jorge The Keeper. On a side note, It's come to my attention that I twice now have horribly misspelled serial killer in the titles. I can chalk that up to the stress of all this but frankly I might just be dumb.

After I had posted part two, I sat against the bed and listened intensely as the disgusting lummox roamed the halls. Another side note, I decided to name the creature, I have dubbed it "The Mimic." as it wore Jessica's face like a ghastly trophy.  Though I suppose that's no fault of its own. I also realize that outside of that it really bears no similarities with a traditional mimic. But if *Stranger Things* can get away with it, why can't I? But I am getting caught up in my own ramblings again. 

In any case I had been trapped. I heard sirens in the distance, but I couldn't be sure they were even coming for me. The Mimic cried out once more, its twin heads bellowing in unison. It echoed up and down the hall, reverberating across the walls. I felt like I was trapped in a sound booth from hell. My head was in my knees, my messy bangs curled around me like a fiery red blanket. I was staring blankly at my phone, the dozens of sent texts to Barb asking where the hell she was, that I needed help.

I wished Perry was here, my adorable Aussie cattle dog. He would nestle himself into my back and bop me with his head until I felt better. He always knew what to do. Barb was always ice cold in rough situations as well. One time we went to a party, and things got a little out of hand. Cops ended up showing up and we had to run out of there, and I was drunk out of my mind. We ended up in someone's backyard trying to climb a fence, real cliche college idiot stuff. Patrol car caught us and I was on the verge of a massive panic attack. Barb just held my hand and looked the cops dead in the eye and explained we had just gotten lost looking for my lost dog. They believed her, even helped us "look for him" and were super bummed when nothing turned up.

My point is I've never really dealt with stressful stuff well. Now, locked behind a barricaded door, I was going to have to. That said, I heard a massive thump against the door, shaking the cabinet in front of it. I jumped thirty feet in the fair, throwing my phone across the room. I heard it smack against the wall and crumple to the floor, at least five new scratches and dent added to it. My eyes went wild looking at the door. The mimic seemed curious, like it wanted to know why this room was off limits to it. It smacked the door once more and let out a gargle.

It sounded like it was trying to speak with a mouthful of water. It choked out a command to seemingly no body.

"Let in." It rasped. Its voice was gravely and hollow, and it repeated its command once more as the door started to shake. The room seemed to shrink with every shake, it felt like the walls would crumble on top of me, burying me in this labyrinth of a hotel forever. I backed up, almost tripping on the gun.

Yes, yes, the gun, that would be my savior. Neglecting the fact I had never even played a first-person shooter, let alone held a gun, I snatched it up off the ground. It felt like a brick in my hand, and I griped the handle, pointing it at the door. My finger was on the trigger, the gun swaying nervously in my hand. I hoped it was loaded, had a full clip or whatever. Or was it magazine? Whatever it didn't matter, I just needed too steady my aim so I didn't shoot my eye out. I Held my arm and winked down the sights as the banging continued.

 "Let in, Let in." The mimic groaned. 

"Piss off." I replied back, barking at the despicable thing. It roared back, angry at the sound of my voice. It clawed at the door harder, its sloth-like mangled arms bashing and slashing into the wood. It started to splinter the wood as it pushed its way inside the room. The cabinet actually dug into the rug and scraped against the hardwood underneath. It sounded like chalk being dragged against raw asphalt. I winced at the sound as The Mimic was almost done clawing its way in. I held it up high and aimed Jesscia's forever screaming face.

*BANG*

The gun sounded off and I flew back from the recoil. The gun dropped to the floor with a clang. The mimic cried out as the bullet had missed and simply skimmed its shoulder. Blood oozed out from the steamy scratch, a hole appearing in the wall behind it. 

"I hurt. I hurt." The mimic wailed stepping back from the door. The heads wiggled around and writhed in agony as that wail became a horrific screech. The sound was like a banshee crying out before it struck a fatal blow. The Mimic stumbled back, struggling to stay on its two legs. It seemed Dr. Fine neglected to give the double torso thing a sturdy base. It continued its wretched crying as it scurried down the hall, repeating the whole time that it hurt.

I was frozen for only a second, then it hit me. This was my chance. I sprinted towards the ruined door and tore what was left of it apart as I ran out of the room. Not before I picked up the smoking gun of course. Useless of a shot that I was, still felt safer with it. The hallway was quiet now, though I could hear light whimpering in the distance. I crept down the hall, gun in hand. I half expected to go around the corner and find the mimic there ready to jump scare me. The whimpering grew louder, along with that familiar wheezing. The mimic was on the prowl.

Turning a corner, I finally felt like I knew where I was going. I had two more turns and I would be faced with the staircase. After that it was a simple matter of fleeing the building. I hurried down those winding halls until I heard it behind me.

"You hurt." I stopped in my tracks, whirling around to face the mimic. It stood tall at the end of the hall. Its chest struggled to contort up and down, labored under the strain of keeping itself alive. A red fluid pooled down its gaping mouth, a spittle of some vile liquid, I'm sure. The gaping wounds where its eyes had been like black voids. The mangled claws were curled up on the ground, a gorilla stance If I had ever seen one. There was no way it could see me, right? It moved one of its hideous claws and pointed at me.

"You hurt." It rasped again. "Why hurt. All hurt. Alive Pain." The mimic struggled with its words; its already rotted brains probably liquefied when Dr. Fine turned the juice on to power it up. It lumbered towards me, clawed arm still outstretched towards me. I raised the gun once more. The mimic groaned and cried; it couldn't even walk in a straight line. It stumbled and fell as it moved. The arms and its back flailed around, looking for purpose. The head on the back, I could tell was just blinking constantly, a prop without direction.

I flinched at the sight of this pitiful thing. I aimed at its head once more. The gun shook less in my hand this time, my breathing calm and collected. I aimed dead center at the end, the mimic had all but stopped in its tracks now, one of its knees had given out. It swayed its head around aimlessly. I couldn't help but feel sorry for it. The violent way it had sprung to life on the whim of a mad man. Truth be told it didn't even look all that angry as it kneeled there in front of me. It looked like it was in constant agony. The thing mewed and muttered as it swayed, like a rabid dog right before death. My hand started to shake the more my sympathy grew.

 "Why we hurt." It asked, a barely audible whisper. I couldn't take it anymore; the gun grew heavier by the second. I put it against the temple of the mimic and looked away, pulling the trigger.

*BANG.*

The recoil was less this time, the gun stayed in my hands. The grip was hot, it stung my palms but I held on. The whimpering ended with the chaos of the gunshot. The mimic slumped over, still twitching. There was somehow even less life behind those crimson eyes now. The second head with its patchwork beard still moved, slack jawed. Its mouth gaped open like a fish but it emitted no sound. I just watched it gawk at me, my own eyes watering with fear and disgust. I raised the gun and just started shooting. Blood from the mimic splattered my face, it felt as warm as the gun in my hand. 

*BANG* 

*BANG*

*BANG*

*click*

*clickclickclick*

I did that about seven more times, the click echoing in my mind for eternity. The mimic was crumpled and bloody, its pale yet boiled skin was caked with holes. I backed away from the slain beast, unsure if it was really and truly dead. I collapsed to the ground, finding it hard to breath. My chest clinched and I started gasping for air. I buried my head in my knees, not want to look at the tragedy next to me any longer. The tears came, and they came heavy and hard. I was bawling my lungs out, happy to be alive yes but mournful of what I had lost today.

I mourned the mimic, the poor thing that had never asked to exist. The creature that had only known pain and suffering in its short twisted life. Head in hands, I wept for the mimic, for I knew no one else would. I was so distracted I didn't notice the clattering of cans and feet rapidly coming up the stairs. Finally, I heard it next to me and in a panic aimed my gun and clicked it at Jorge. He was battered and bruised; his forehead swollen to the size of a melon. In his hand he held a jerry can.

 "What are you still doing here Miss." He choked out in surprise. His eyes flickered to the fallen beast."Dios Mio." He muttered, making the sign of the cross on his chest. 

"I thought you were dead." I replied, still holding the empty gun to him. He gently took it out of my hands and put it in his waist band.   
"Knocked me out god. I thought you had escaped, so I went to grab this." He held up the cans. "It all needs to go Miss. It needs to be cleansed." He said this so calmly, walking over to the fallen mimic. He raised the jerry can over it and began pouring gasoline all over it. The overwhelming fumes ran through the halls, the stench of gas stung me. I got up and started towards the stairs and noticed that it had been covered in gas.

Turning to Jorge, I saw he had thrown the empty can across the hall, looming over the mimic. He fumbled around his pockets, clearly looking for something. He spoke aloud. 

"I'm sorry you were dragged into this miss. I should have ended this years ago. It's my cross to bear. Get out, now. While you still can." He said emotionlessly, he brought a silver tipped lighter up to his face. I didn't protest, I just ran. I ran down those crotchety old stairs to the first floor faster than I ever had.  As soon as I hit the bottom, I felt a wave of heat blasting towards me. I kept running, the fire spreading faster and faster. The twisting halls of the motel were cursing at me, mocking me at every bad turn.

Jorge hadn't filled the whole place with gas, but he must have known it'd burn like cinder. The halls were getting hazy, and it was harder to breath as I started to hack up a lung. Finally, through the fog I saw the exit sign. I rushed towards it, flames nipping at my heels. I busted through the door with a gasp, welcoming the fresh air. Smoke poured out behind me, the neon orange glow puffing up behind it. I staggered down the alley, past Jorge's car. Sirens wailed on, fire and cops, I'm sure. This time they were coming for me, albeit a little too late.

I made it to the curb across the street from the two-level inferno. A crowd of onlookers had already started to form. Someone touched my soot covered shoulder and asked if I was alright. I brushed them off and sat on the curb. My dead eyed expression fixed on the blaze. Not long after, the cops and fire brigade came. They managed to contain the fire to just the motel but most of it was gone, along with any evidence of the mimic's existence.

I was interviewed on the scene and told them that my teacher had been kidnapping young people and killing them, and I had escaped, rescued even by the caretaker. They had struggled and started the fire, both perishing while I made my daring escape. The cops seemed to buy it, although if they go looking for any 911 records they may have further questions. I was offered a ride to the hospital but declined. Two detectives in nice overcoats and one with a grizzled beard came up, flashing their badges at me and the uniforms talking to me.

They took them aside and basically told them they would give me a ride home. Getting in the back of their black sedan I watched the hotel inferno quiet down. The firefighters had all but put it out, a lone rubber wearing man spraying down the ruins with a cockeyed grin. On the way back to the dorm the detectives soft interrogated me. How long had I known Dr. Fine, why did I make that "crank" 911 call earlier (yhea knew that was coming.) And what did Fine show me when the Keeper brought me back to the hotel. I frowned at that question, I don't recall telling the unis I had left and come back, nor did I say as much in the call. I told them as much and the one with the beard shifted in his seat. 

"Perhaps we misheard you. But he did show you something right, did he show you his notes, where he kept them." Beard pressed on. 

"He- didn't show me anything. He was a seral killer. But you knew that already." I questioned. 

"He was in our sights for two weeks now." Beard admitted. "Smart man, but sloppy."

"Ego will do that." Beardless chirped up.

 "My dorm is right up ahead." I said uneasy. For a moment I thought they were going to drive past and whisk me away to some government black site or something. I could say I've seen too many movies, but I shot a walking corpse earlier that night, so anything was game. Instead, they slowed down and let me off on the curb. Beard grabbed my hand for a second on my way out. 

"When all is said and done, there might be something left in the ruins. My associate and I will be in town for a few more days dealing with something else. If you change your mind and want to update your story, please don't hesitate to call." He explained, a softness in his voice. He handed me a note with a number scribbled onto it.

"Thanks, but I sort of want to repress all this as soon as possible." Beardless laughed at that.

"I don't blame you Abi Mae. The local cops won't bother you, of that we can assure you. " He said.

"I thought you guys were the cops." I said, easing back from the car.

"Nope." Beard replied.

"Well then who the hell are you guys." I asked, my heart beating 1000 times a minute.

"Nobody." Beard replied simply. With that he started up the sedan and drove away. Beardless muttered something under his breath; something like "Bet that sounded cooler in your head, Marc." I like to think that's what he said anyway. That is where our tale ends. I went back up to my dorm, which was abuzz with the news that Dr. Fine had been found dead in a motel. Rumors and whispers already spread like poison ivy, but I knew the truth.

My dorm room was unlocked, and I found Barb pacing the room, a horrified look on her face, and phone gripped in her hands. I didn't know wither to hit her or hug her. She chose for me, as soon as she saw me, she leapt up and grabbed me, saying how sorry she was, she didn't have her phone on her, she was dealing with something heavy, and she would make it up to me for sure. I didn't care about all that, I was just happy to see her. I was happy to see anyone really.

This was a couple days ago; I'm writing this from bedroom at home. Mom gave me her usual spiel but I was just happy to see Perry. He's snuggled next to me now, dead to the world. I thought about calling those fed guys, but honestly, I don't see the point. Fine is gone, the mimic is gone. I'd just be dredging up wounds. Maybe I'll give them a call if I'm ever in trouble like that again. But honestly, what are the chances of that. Until next time reddit, hope your week went better than mine.
