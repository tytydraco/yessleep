I still think about this. This case. And our reputation after the incident.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was like any normal day, everyone was off to work and school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 We lived in the countryside in England in a medium sized town, surrounded by a large forest.    


&#x200B;

We wake up at seven. We get to school by eight. Any later time is a problem between your parents and the school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our school was different. Not the kids. 

&#x200B;

The teachers. They were weird, i was signed to class 9 - everyone made up this story that class 9 was haunted, and the teachers would trap you in the classroom so you dont go to break on time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well that wasnt the case. Primary school, especially in WoodRidge was tough and made of lies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That’s why i stick to myself in class.“Onita Anne, would you stick your head in the exercise book rather than the window..” 

&#x200B;

Miss Haylinn scoffed as I quickly looked down at the boring work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You cant blame me for what i am about to tell you, you cannot blame eight year olds who are bored to death to do this type of thing in this ancient town.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This my children is a new thing that is being brought into our classroom, it is a treasure chest box - it is a very valuable item, and we should each treat it with respect like we would to eachother.” 

Miss Haylinn exclaimed, this was the day that changed almost all our lives. forever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

”What does it do.?” Asked a kid in my class who came closer to the massive circle that formed around the chest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, anyone who is hardworking and trustworthy , you will be awarded with something inside this chest.” Miss Haylinn smiled at all our innocent curious faces that glimmered back at her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All of us gasped with awe as we stammered forward to the chest which Miss Haylinn quickly stopped us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The chest was mesmerising, even if you were my age or a tiny bit older than me at that time you would say the same thing. It was decorated with different kinds and colours of fishes, sharks and dolphins all scattered at the bottom and the top. Blue, purple and gold shimmering from all around the chest, the massive gold lock in the middle, and the purple stars that surrounded it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Honestly theres more to describe but its too much to write.I know at that time we were thinking of the same thing. We wanted to open that box, touch it - feel it, anything. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All of us had this strong desire and we couldnt get rid of it - so from that day we tried to get Miss Haylinn to open the box for us so we can see the treasures beyond. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No one won an award, we walked in the classroom silently - we never misbehaved only few of us - if you did misbehave you infact missed a once in a lifetime chance of gaining the prize from that chest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But no one was able to see what was in there.

&#x200B;

Except for one student.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Terrance Ide.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I need that box, so i gathered some of my friends to help, Chad, Arlo and Cammy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I told my mother not to collect me from school early just take her time, i sat there eating my apple on the green alien-like carpet staring at Miss Haylinn who was talking to Onita Anne.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I remember looking at Onita, her beautiful brown eyes shining back at me, instead of being nice to her, i gave her an arrogant look which she responded back with a smirk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After she left, i was into action. Miss Haylinn had to leave early that day, so as a normal eight year old coward of a boy, i waited for her to escort me to the main office to wait for mother.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I then made a lie saying i had to get my bag which I purposely left upstairs in Class 9.

&#x200B;

They stupidly allowed me. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wished they said no or told me i need an adult to come with me. 

&#x200B;

But that didnt happen. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I ran upstairs, and into my classroom where that beautiful box layed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My friends came after me as we lifted it, it was heavier than we thought but we managed to carry it into the office, covering it with my large blue puffer coat - we were ready to see what was inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That evening was a blur when i brought it into my house for the first and the last time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My Dad wondered about it asking where i got it from, i just blurted out that i found it dumped in the bins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The next day was exciting, that’s until Miss Haylinn realised that the chest was missing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I walked into the classroom, i did not hear a single pin drop - everyone was seated in their usual seats as i rushed to mine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked over at all the kids in my class who had their eyes on Miss Haylinn. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She looked rough, her eyes didnt dance with excitement they infact darted, trembling with trepidation all around the room - the colour from her cheeks slowly bled out of her body down into the void. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her short breathes became raspy and the Miss Haylinn we once knew was gone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Forever.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She could not get a single word out. All the kids were stunned it was if we were all preserved in time, gone, wasted, missing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Those were the words that described that uncanny day, Miss Haylinn was hunched over with an animalistic movement she stumbled towards the front of the class whom the kids already had terror consuming their body’s at that very moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She whispered something to us. None of us moved. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I could of heard my heart pumping at that second. She then muttered something continuously, our bodies edged on the plastic chairs - her volume and tone increased.

&#x200B;

“W-where……is i-it…?” she asked, we all knew she couldn’t smile it was like her mind was forcing her not to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At that exact moment, i exchanged looks with Onita Anne, her wide eyes and the fright that ate her body alive.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“W-WHERE……..W-WHERE……W-   WHERE IS IT.. WHERE IS THE CHEST…..W-WHERE….W-WHERE…”

&#x200B;

 the ear-splitting shrill throttled my body, as i gasped - my body shaking rapidly as sweat spilled down my forehead, my eyes snapped to my classmates who were alarmed, their sweet innocent faces were replaced by a ghastly, unexplainable look.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No one answered. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No one moved. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No one looked away from Miss Haylinn.She silently moved back to her seat, her glare fixated on where the chest used to be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Break time arrived. Ive never rushed out of a room so quickly than i did just there. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The cold breeze slapped us as i looked at my classmates who were miserable like Miss Haylinn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I managed to gather half of my classmates, i told them about the treasure chest box and how i have it at my home. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All of them scoffed and shouted at me, asking me if i was okay in the head. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I then told them, if you want me to bring it back i suggest you come to my house for a playdate.

&#x200B;

That was the start of the case. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eight children. All eight years old. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Coming to Terrance Ide’s house. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The class clown. The bad kid.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I remember that evening like the back of my hand, only eight of my classmates arrived at my home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 It was dull and filled with rain, as we ran inside not wanting to get our clothes wet. Our parents were fine with us having a little playdate, i never told them about the Miss Haylinn situation - I believe no one in our class did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was, Chanell White, 

Henry Seau, 

Drey Arelan, 

Riley Blue, 

Esmaye Easton, 

Nick Stone,

Garner Davies, 

&#x200B;

and finally, Onita Anne.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those were the kids who came, stumbling awkwardly inside my warm house, my mother and father exchanged kind greetings as all of them did the same as i gestured them into my large room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What is this all about may i ask..” Drey Arelan demanded, as we dragged the bean bags from the back of my room and placed them in an irregular matter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Drey Arelan demanded to Terrance Ide, as i turned my gaze to him - his light curly hair, light blue eyes and a small dimple on the side of his mouth. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He exchanged positive looks at each of us but maintained a long one with me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I gathered you here because i know all of you want to see what’s in that treasure box.” 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Terrance smiled as i turned to Chanell who was confused as i was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come on man, Miss is going to get mad im going to get in trouble and i dont wanna miss movie night!!”

&#x200B;

 Nick complained as small high pitched voices came over his.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guys, i know but we should do something while we are here okay..?” Terrance comforted the groaning children as i crossed my legs on the bean bag.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So.. so what do we do then” asked Nick as he peered at Terrance who bit his bottom lip and leaned his head on the palm of his hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, we cant go outside.. so why dont we play a game.?” Garner suggested as the group sighed and whined again causing Terrance to stand up and keep the volume down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Lets play dolls and princesses.. i brought some just in case” Chanell volunteered, however the group looked disappointed - i knew it was to do with the chest, i was eager to see what was in it as well but i assume have to wait until after tea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What about the game…?” Esmaye asked, sitting up and staring at Terrance who looked over at me for a split second.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe after tea? Im sure we would have time.” I replied as Esmaye sunk in the bean bag sighing deeply. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her long curly brown hair matching mine, and her smooth brown skin tone similar to me and Drey’s.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there any black haired dolls..?” Riley questioned Chanell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ohhh can i have the blonde one.!?” Henry asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can i have the black toned doll please.?” I turned to Chanell who nodded at everyones requests, dipping her hands inside her pink bag and thrusting the different coloured dolls with different hair and shapes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I will never know how long we sat there and played dolls together as a big group but i can say it was one of the most amazing experience i had in a long time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well that was until we had tea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We all sat in silence. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The munching of taco shells and the gulping of orange juice filled the room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I dont think anyone wanted to speak at the dinner table.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked across at Terrance, he was busy dipping his half eaten taco shell in the tomato ketchup, i didnt eat half of my food. 

&#x200B;

I remember just feeling something off.Esmaye didnt look at anyone, she hasnt said anything to me the entire evening.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The dinner table was cleared, and we hanged out in Terrance’s room. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We debated on the game we wanted to play whilst our parents came through the door every 2-3 minutes.

&#x200B;

“What about hide and seek..?” Nick suggested as Garner smirked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay then, who’s the seeker and who’s the hider..?” Asked Terrance as he glanced at me with a smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nine of us so…. Five of us are going to be a hider and… four seekers??” Drey boldly stated, as he gave us a smirk of impression.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay then who are the hiders..?” Riley asked as we all looked at eachother.Everyone was chosen as either a hider or a seeker, as the child who lives in this house i was made the seeker - which i didnt mind at all.

&#x200B;

Onita, Drey, Nick, Henry and Esmaye were hiders, 

&#x200B;

and Me, Chanell, Garner and Riley were seekers.The game quickly commenced as the four of us layed in my room whilst the five of them dashed out, giggling and whispering over eachother.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All of us had to face the wall and count to 40, no peeking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The muffled laughter and talking from our parents downstairs filled the unpleasant silence that took place. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chanell walked out the room looking around the hallway, Riley ran downstairs where our parents were and me and Garner looked around the top floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We entered my parents room, kneeling down and looking under the bed - nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We know your somewhere.. come out wherever you are!!” Garner shouted, his squeaky voice echoing down the large hallway.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Me and Garner grinned as we now searched the bathroom. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We searched the guest room. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 The living room. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 The kitchen. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All of us, Garner, Chanell and Riley came together after a good ten minutes passed by.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 My house was big, i know the best hiding places in this house, so where was everyone…?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“W-what… w-where..where is everyone…?” Riley asked as she tried catching her breath.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

None of us answered.That’s until we heard a scream.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn’t just a regular shriek. It was more bloodcurdling as the voice cracked in half. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As if  the person was brutally crushed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It sounded like a child’s scream. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A collective group of children screaming, and yelling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We all ran, no hesitation. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Chanell and Riley darted to the guest room, and me and Garner sprinted to my parents room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What i saw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 What we both saw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I will never be able to imagine that again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A pale body was now crouched underneath my parents bed. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was Drey. 

&#x200B;

He was shocked. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was consumed with trepidation as his eyes darted from one place to another. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We couldn’t make out what he was scared of. The one thing, that was abnormal about Drey, was what he was whispering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was similar to Miss Haylinn.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“W-where……is i-it…?” He whispered as he peered at Me and Garner who were kneeling down to his level.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where’s.. what buddy.?” Garner asked as he looked at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The small boy yelled and turned around, withering with agony he kicked and pulled at anything, something to ease the pain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Garner and i were catatonic as Garner ran to our parents whilst i shouted at Drey.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His small hand was cold. I clenched it and dragged him out from the bed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 He instantly stopped moving around and yelling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“W-WHERE……..W-WHERE……W-WHERE IS IT.. WHERE IS THE CHEST…..W-WHERE….W-WHERE…”
