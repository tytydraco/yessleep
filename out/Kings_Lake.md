### Chapter Two?

"King is dead." Joel told me.

I hadn't smoked a cigarette in almost thirty years. I bummed a smoke off of him. Joel lit it for me. I puffed it ceremoniously and savored the foulness of its flavor, coughing, buzzing from the nicotine hit and then I held it and watched it burn.

"What are the arrangements?" I asked.

"He wanted to be scattered from the tower." Joel said slowly. His answer made me sigh.

"There's no tower?" I wondered, saying it like a question.

"Not that I know of." Joel spat and sipped his beer. I had thought he didn't drink anymore, but then again - I had quit smoking.

"I didn't think you were a real person." I nudged him. I wanted to cheer him up. I felt bad about the note I had left on his post at the King website all those years ago. At the time I was green with jealousy, immature, and I was half drunk. I doubted he or King had ever read it, but I still thought about it all the time. I had even signed it; anonymity was never my style.

"Am I? Sometimes I feel like we are all just characters in a story King's writing." Joel took what was left of my smoke and finished it. It kinda felt like a kiss, since my lipstick was on it. I took his beer and eyed him.

"Why are you telling me that?" I asked.

"You can't write this stuff. I mean, meeting you. It's uncanny." Joel frowned.

"Not really. The world is very small when you look at how we are all in circles and all of those circles intersect. You've heard of the handshake rule?" I tried to explain that it wasn't weird.

"I don't get it." Joel shook his head.

"The handshake rule? Anyone is just a few introductions away from anyone else." I offered.

"Circles." Joel said with a strange mysticism. I felt a chill.

I thought for a moment, about telling Joel about *The Secret*. I decided not to. If he believed me, it would probably drive him insane. He already understood the hideous geometry of it. It would be better not to tell him what it all meant.

Not telling him would also protect him from the Hounds of Ruin. I could already feel them getting closer to me. He had many years left, a legacy to uphold and great stories to create. To expose him to the fraud of it all, it would be a dire sin. I changed the subject and offered:

"King included me along with the names of Long, Lovecraft, Smith, Campbell and Hodgson. He made all of us into characters. You know what the difference is, between Schindler and Lovecraft?" I asked.

"What? That your writing was cancelled before it ever mattered?" Joel teased me.

"Other than that. When he wrote me into the story, as a master horror writer among the others, he was establishing a fifth wall." I smiled darkly.

"How's that work?" Joel chuckled. I felt relieved. He had already disregarded my notion of circles. A dangerous notion, forgotten.

"Speaking directly to the audience is breaking the fourth wall, because it brings the audience into the story. The fifth wall is the audience behind the audience. The reflection of reality within the story. It is no longer fiction because the story becomes real-life." I explained.

"We are just characters in a story." Joel realized.

I frowned. In my attempt to conceal the truth I had inadvertently revealed it. I had pulled the curtain so far over it opened back up and had exposed what I was trying to hide. "Damnit."

"What?" Joel asked almost innocently. Then it clicked. He went silent.

"Joel? You okay?" I asked him. He just stared off into empty space. I had basically killed him. He had realized the truth of our existence. It was no fault of mine that he stood on the precipice of the truth, but I was the one who had pushed him over the edge.

I left him there, frozen like that. There was nothing I could do for him. He wasn't able to withstand the Hounds of Ruin for even a moment. Some people fell to them instantly. Others, like me, lasted for years, the hunt, the torment - the chase - continued.

I said quietly as I abandoned him: "I'm sorry, Joel."

The Hounds of Ruin were close. I had learned *The Secret*, knowing that I would be erased, destroyed. Joel had no idea what had happened. He had suddenly realized that circles, unnatural, proved with geometry what our universe was made of. I refused to watch as he disappeared.

When I looked back, he was gone. Fear gripped me. The Hounds of Ruin had taken him. That meant that they were close. I didn't fully understand how they functioned, only that knowledge of *The Secret* was their access to our universe, dimension or existence. Knowing the truth of reality gave them a way in. It was their only way in and anyone who knew was vulnerable, their rightful prey.

I knew all about *The Secret*. I fully understood it and feared what I knew. I feared their presence. I had to get away from that place, even though there was nowhere I could go. I might as well be a stick figure drawn on a piece of paper. The Hounds of Ruin were like demented children with erasers. Why they were toying with me, haunting me, killing off anyone who knew me, I couldn't comprehend.

I was sure that as soon as I knew their intentions that I would be erased from existence. Joel no longer existed. It was as though he never had.

Only I remembered him and only my experiences were affected by his existence. Playing the game of the Hounds of Ruin was a game of ignorance. I realized that my survival meant I would have to break their rules.

I arrived home and heard the news that King had died. I had known about it for two days and the world was only at that moment acknowledging his death. Joel was never there to sit at his father's side and say goodbye to him. Instead, King had died alone, only later to be discovered by his gardener.

I felt sick. Fear was making me tremble as reality began to unravel. Without Joel, King had never heard of me. 

I went to my bookshelf and took a copy of the seventh book about the tower. I noticed that the titles of King's books had changed, their thickness had increased. Joel's influence on his father's work was gone. King had spent years alone writing different stories. 

Even his masterpiece, the tower series, was different. I looked at the cover and noticed that the childe was no longer imagined like Clint Eastwood. Instead, he looked more like Idris Elba.

The talking raven was gone from his shoulder, replaced by a whimsical dog-like creature that could speak in a cartoonish voice. Even the villain was different.

I shuddered in horrified dread as I saw that the Hounds of Ruin were replaced by the notorious fan-fiction character: Freddy King. The force devouring my world, killing my friends, had covered its tracks. Freddy King no longer looked like a young Stephen King. Freddy King looked like a giant spider with one eye, calling itself the Red King, instead. It wore a costume that looked like Santa Claus and it was armed with flying golden hand grenades called '*Rowling Snitches*'. It had eaten its mate, the Red Queen. Then it gave birth to an army of werespiders, disguises for the true enemy, the Hounds of Ruin.

I dropped the book and it fell open to page 439. I stared, trembling in shock and terror as I read my own name. I slowly picked it back up, trembling, reading about the fate of Schindler, a horror writer that lived on the lake where all the other horror writers lived together.

"No, no, no!" I cried, shaking, paralyzed and unable to wake from my living nightmare.

I was doomed, erased from existence. I could see how they were doing it, how the Hounds of Ruin were working me over. There was only one mention of me left in the book. No longer was I there to help the heroes gun down the monsters devouring every world from the rotten core outward. 

*"Their bullets began to miss, bouncing off of pieces of rubble that were telepathically controlled by Matthew McConaughey. One by one they were all killed until only Idris Elba was left.*

*He somehow got a lucky shot and killed the bad guy, but it was entirely unbelievable. He no longer remembered what his own father looked like. He fired random bullets from an ordinary gun and couldn't kill anything with his heart.*

*All of his friends were dead. He turned the gun on himself, saying a weird prayer. Then the gunslinger blew his own brains out."*

I screamed and threw the book so hard that it broke a window in my cabin and fell outside onto the back porch. I fell to my knees, crying. I looked at the warm sticky tears on my hands and saw that I was so distraught that I was crying blood.

"Jesus, oh gawd, oh no!" I sobbed. I realized with mind-shattering clarity why the Hounds of Ruin had spared me. I had given them a way in. They were using me to do far more than merely erase a few important horror writers.

"Lovecraft, Chambers, Hill, Gaiman and Del Toro." I spoke their names like I was trying to invoke the protection of saints. They were all being erased, one by one. I looked up at the books on my shelves and watched it happening. Fear drove me to a singular point. I knew that I had to forget all of it.

I needed a way to make everyone else remember, without knowing why. I needed to tell of the enemy's only weakness, without anyone being exposed to the dangerous knowledge. I had to find a way to end it without letting them win. I sat down and began to write, feverishly. Then I sent the first chapter to myself, knowing I would soon forget and I would write the second chapter without even knowing about the first chapter. Not until I put it all back together.

I went into my bathroom with a towel wrapped around the handle of an icepick and a smooth flat stone. I looked into the mirror and my lips quivered in horror at what I was about to do. I was deathly afraid of needles and the icepick's point in the corner of my eye was, to me, the ultimate symbol of my deepest nightmares. Then I said out loud to myself, before I struck the stone:

"It is just a little lobotomy. Don't be such a baby."

I couldn't do it, not on my first try. I went back and worked on the first chapter, making sure I gave every clue, told every detail, without assembling the words directly into the mind of any readers. Then, satisfied that I was ready and with blood already running down my cheeks, I hit 'Send' and went back into the bathroom.

No more stalling.

### Chapter One?

I am not sure who I am. I do not know how I got here. I am a writer, that I know.

There is a file that I am supposed to attach to this account. I must write about what I am to do. It is hard to write.

I know I must write it. I think my name is Schindler, or perhaps it is Bachman. There is no way for me to be certain.

Everything is confusing. I keep getting thoughts about people, Joel, Robert and Amy. I have no idea who they are, but I feel like I know them. They must be characters in whatever I am writing.

I just looked into the bathroom and there is blood everywhere. I am very scared. I don't know what is happening.

I tried to call for help, but somebody cut the phone line to my cabin.

There are wolves coming for me, but they cannot get in. I want to build a fire; wolves are scared of fire. I cannot start a fire, my hands won't stop shaking.

I went down to the lake this morning. There is no food left in my cabin. There are other cabins all around the lake. I know this is King's Lake. It is a manmade lake, although it is over a hundred thousand years old. That's one of the few things I am sure about.

The wolves cannot get in, they are starving. I can hear them howling at night and I can see their yellow eyes glowing as they watch me.

I cannot get to the other cabins. I tried to signal to the writers in the other cabins for help but they just wave to me and go back inside to their typewriters.

The wolves are all but gone, as though they were never there. I find their scratch marks and their footprints. It is difficult to explain that they are not real.

Sometimes the wolves are spiders. Other times they are nothing at all. I saw one of the wolves and I thought it knew me.

I haven't seen the wolves in days.

The boat scares me but I am very hungry and there is no food left. Writing is so hard to do. I am not a good writer.

I will take the boat to the island I have noticed in the middle of the lake. There is a crumbling ruin on it, that I can see, now that I am looking directly at it.

The ruin on the island is very strange. The longer I stare at it the larger it is. I was looking at it all day yesterday and it is basically a tower, built from perfect blocks.

Sometimes when I am staring at the tower in the middle of the lake, I can see that it is made of *Legos* or something. It is like a child is building it from blocks in a nursey, a giant baby that I cannot see.

Sometimes I feel like I am just a toy. I wonder, strangely, if the wolves are spiders and they are playing with me. I feel afraid of them, but I know that they are forgetting me.

I am always afraid, now. I am scared that I am starting to remember something. I am so hungry; I have to do something. I am sure I am fading away, disappearing.

There was a book in the broken glass. I found it and I know I must take it with me.

I have decided that I am going to take the book with me. I've got the book from in the broken glass and I'm going to the tower tomorrow, using the boat, and I am going to burn it and let the ashes go out onto the lake, from the tower.

I will burn the book. It is all that is left of life and death, all that is left of the King. This is King's Lake. I know I must scatter the ashes from the tower. I don't know how I know. It is all that I am sure of anymore.

There is no other way, no matter how afraid I am.

The file on my screen says to include it with my writing and not to read it. I have attached it to what I have written, although I no longer understand any of it.

When I burn the book, I will say:

"Long live the King."
