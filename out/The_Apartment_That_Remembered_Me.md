I moved into the building because it was cheap and close to the bus. It was one of those narrow, old places wedged between a bakery and a shuttered storefront. The landlord was a man with a permanent sunburn smile and a key ring that jingled like loose change. He handed me the keys and said, “Third floor, left. Watch the stairs at night, they creak.” I laughed and told him thanks. He watched me lug the last box up like he expected something to go wrong.

Everything about the apartment felt small but honest. There was a window over the sink that opened to the alley, a radiator that clanked like a living thing, and a closet that swallowed my winter clothes. The landlord left a single note on the kitchen table: do not leave the front door unlocked at night. I thought that was odd old-man talk and stuck it under a mug.

The first few nights were normal. I would watch late shows, fall asleep to the radiator’s mechanical breathing, wake up once or twice because a siren rolled through the city. Small things happened, the kind you can blame on old plumbing: pipes that sang at dawn, lights that flickered in a certain rhythm, the TV changing volume when I passed the couch. I walked past expecting the world to behave like it always had.

Then my keys went missing.

I remember the exact moment. I had left them on the counter after fumbling with a package. Ten minutes later I needed to leave again and they were gone. I turned the apartment upside down. Sofa cushions, pockets, fridge, the plants I had nearly killed; nothing. I was sure I had set them down. I must have been tired, I told myself. I retraced my steps, checked the trash, sifted the laundry basket like a man digging for a memory. No keys.

When I called the landlord he did not ask where I had looked. He said, “Check the freezer.” I laughed because it was ridiculous. He said it again, calmly, like a fact. I opened the freezer. The keys were sitting on the top shelf between two frozen dumplings, frost tracing the metal like a secret. I did not remember putting them there. I told him thank you. He only said, “The place remembers,” and hung up.

I thought it was a joke. A coincidence. I stopped telling friends. At night my brain would rewind the day and replay every second like a scratched tape. When I closed my eyes I saw the counter, the keys, the dumplings, a smile that was not mine.

Other things began to shift. I would wake up with the TV on a channel I didn’t watch. A mug I had left on the stove would be in the sink, the dish towel folded, the window slightly ajar. Once I found a note taped inside the closet that said: stop opening the window at three. My handwriting, my pen. I had never written it.

I tried to stay rational. Old buildings have drafts. People borrow things sometimes. But an urge hollowed my chest, a rising feeling that the apartment was paying attention, learning what I did and then answering me back in small, private ways.

One cold Thursday I came home and the hallway smelled like something burning. Not smoke exactly, more like paper left too close to a candle. My door was locked. I used the keys from my pocket. They turned, but when I pushed the door it did not open the way it should. It opened halfway and then stopped, as if there was someone holding it from the inside.

“Hello?” I called, heart waking with purpose. Silence. I pushed again. The door swung open, revealing my apartment arranged like a stranger had been living in my habits. Shoes by the radiator, my jacket on a chair, the mug I always used for tea on the low table exactly where I always left it. On the TV, a paused video of someone walking down my building’s alley. Obvious, stupid camera footage, the kind of thing a phone captures. The timestamp in the corner had been taken an hour earlier.

I found another note on the kitchen table. It said: you forgot to lock the back window. I checked. The latch was open. I could have sworn I had closed it this morning. I closed it and the hairs on my neck prickled like static.

After that night I stopped sleeping. I would go hours without rest, then wake with vague memories of someone standing at the foot of my bed, watching. Not touching, only watching. The closet light would flicker, the radiator would breathe louder, and the apartment would feel full of small, patient things that belonged to neither the ceiling nor the floor.

One morning I found a stack of my own drawings on the table. I draw sometimes to calm down: faces, hands, places I’ve never been. They were all there, pages I had never produced. Some were of my apartment from angles I did not think to sketch. In the corner of one I discovered a figure. It was tiny, shaded like a shadow, and behind it someone had written: you’re getting used to me.

I moved the drawings to the trash. The next night they were back on the table, arranged in chronological order like a timeline of what the place had learned about me.

I told myself to leave. But where would I go? The bus stop was a fifteen minute walk and I had no one to call. Plus, the landlord. When I told him about the keys, about the notes, he did not sound surprised. He said, “It doesn’t hurt anyone. It just keeps you from forgetting.” He spoke like a man describing the weather.

That phrase followed me into the kitchen one night when I found the oven turned down low with a pot of water on it and the gas knob cracked. The pot had steamed until the label on a plastic jar softened and had almost melted. On the lid the words were written in condensation: remember the note.

I stopped leaving the front door unlocked. I started moving with extra caution, checking windows twice, wrapping a towel around the door handle just in case. The apartment sensed it and adapted. Things that used to move now stayed still. The TV flicked to static and remained that way for longer. Once, very late, I heard footsteps pad through the floor above me. Not the regular shuffle of someone who lived there, but careful, as if the person was trying to step on particular boards.

I realized, much too late, that the apartment was not only remembering. It was practicing.

One night I woke to the sound of my own voice. It was muffled, like a recording played back through a wall. Through the thin plaster I could hear it whispering my name and then saying things I had only ever thought in the dark: things about leaving, about mistakes, about how the radiator hid secrets. My mouth was dry. I walked into the hallway and the voice stopped. There was no one. But my door was unlocked and on the inside someone had opened it a sliver and left it that way.

I moved the next day with two full bags and my heart underlined by panic. The landlord watched me from the landing. He did not ask why I was leaving. He only nodded and handed me my deposit envelope. “It remembers less on the ground floor,” he said, half-smiling. “Good luck.” I left the key on the table like a bad memory.

Weeks passed. I kept the apartment in my rearview like a story I could not read without flinching. Sometimes I would dream I was back in the kitchen, finding new notes in places where only I had been. Once I dreamed the radiator hummed my name and the keys were in the freezer again. I woke with my hands around my own throat, as if I had been reaching for something in the dark.

A month later I received a postcard with no return address. On it someone had drawn a tiny window with a thread of smoke curling up. Inside, in handwriting I recognized because it looked like my own on the notes, it said: thanks for remembering to lock the front door.

I folded the postcard and put it on my new kitchen table. I have yet to decide whether I should feel relieved or guilty. Sometimes at night I still check the locks twice and press my palm against the window glass to feel the cold. It feels like a place that once belonged to a person and learned to keep them.

If you ever live somewhere old and cheap, check the freezer. If the keys are there, maybe take them as an offer. Maybe the place will protect you. Maybe it will want something in return.
