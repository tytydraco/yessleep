I’ve been a scout leader for almost twenty years now. I’ve seen every prank, every scraped knee, every late-night ghost story around the fire. But this one I can’t make sense of. I’ve written and rewritten this post a dozen times, trying to find a rational explanation. Maybe someone here can help me. Maybe writing it out will help me sleep again.

It happened three summers ago, during our big regional campout. Nearly fifty scouts from a dozen different troops, pitched tents in the old forest reserve near Pine Hollow. It’s an isolated place, acres of thick spruce and pine with the ground soft from decades of needles. No cell service, no generators. Just the hiss of the campfire and the whisper of the trees.

  


**Round 1**

After dinner the first night, one of the older scouts suggested we play *Sardines*. If you’ve never played: it’s like reverse hide-and-seek. One person hides, everyone else seeks, and when you find the hider, you quietly join them until there’s just one seeker left, alone in the dark.

David volunteered to go first. He was tall, quiet, a reliable kid who took things seriously. We gave him five minutes to hide and then spread out with our flashlights.

The forest at night feels alive, every beam of light catching a thousand eyes of dew, every sound multiplied by the trees. At first, it was laughter and calling out, the rustle of branches and crunch of boots. After ten minutes, though, the sounds thinned out. One by one, the giggles stopped.

Fifteen minutes in, nobody had found David. We were about to call it when we heard it: his whistle. Three short, one long -> the scout’s signal. It echoed strangely through the trees, as if it came from everywhere at once. We followed it, laughing, shouting for him to give us another hint.

But the forest kept growing quieter. The laughter and footsteps of the others seemed to fade, until I realized I couldn’t hear anyone else at all. Just my own breathing and the occasional whistle, now softer, slower.

When I finally found them, I nearly tripped into the pit. It was a natural hollow in the forest floor, big enough to hold a small car. They were all there pressed shoulder to shoulder, backs to the walls of the pit, faces half-lit by the moon. Nobody spoke. They just smiled, whispering for me to join.

It was funny, at that moment. Eerie, yes, but the kind of eerie you laugh about later. David grinned and said, “You’re the last one.”

I remember laughing back, but my voice sounded strange, …small,… muffled by the trees.

  


**Round 2**

We played again. This time, another troop’s scout went first. Same result: lots of laughter, then silence, then the distant whistle leading us to a cramped hiding spot under a fallen tree. Everyone piled in, giggling and shushing each other.

The forest swallowed our noise so completely that I started noticing the silence more than the game. When fifty people go quiet in a living forest, you *should* still hear something: the wind, the insects, the frogs by the creek. But it was just… still. Like the woods were holding their breath.

Still, we chalked it up to atmosphere and kept playing. Kids love a bit of spookiness.

  


**Round 3**

Eric was the kind of scout who couldn’t stay serious for five seconds. Always cracking jokes, always the loudest singer during campfire songs. So when he volunteered to hide for round three, everyone groaned and laughed, knowing he’d probably pick some ridiculous spot and then jump out screaming “BOO!” when we got close.

He vanished into the dark while the rest of us counted by the fire. Fifty of us, all laughing, all alive with that nervous energy you get before a game in the woods at night.

When the last number was called, the forest swallowed us whole.

At first, it was the usual chorus of movement; boots crunching leaves, kids whispering, flashlights bobbing between tree trunks like fireflies. I moved slower than most, letting the others range ahead. I liked to listen to the night birds, the trickle of the creek somewhere off to the left, the faraway murmur of kids calling names.

But as the minutes passed, that soundscape began to thin.

First it was subtle,… just a gap between voices, a little too long between laughs. Then the forest started *swallowing* sound. I’d hear someone shout “Eric?” and before I could call back, their voice would fade as if the trees themselves leaned in and smothered it.

I remember shining my flashlight toward where I thought I heard movement. Only trees. The beam caught a bit of mist twisting between the trunks, like breath.

Ten minutes in, I realized I hadn’t heard a single person in a while. No snapping twigs, no whispering. Just my own boots, the creak of my pack straps, and the shallow drag of my breath.

Then, faintly…. *whistling.*

Three short, one long. The scout signal.

I stopped. The sound was distant, but I couldn’t tell where from. It bounced off the trees, soft and hollow, like it was being played inside the wood itself.

I called out, “Eric! That you?”

The whistle came again, a little closer now, but from *behind* me. I turned, the flashlight jittering over black bark and empty space.

I tried moving toward it, calling names as I went. No reply. Just the occasional burst of that whistle, like it was teasing me, always a few steps ahead, …or behind, … or to the side.

Fifteen minutes passed. Maybe twenty. My throat was dry from shouting.

That was when I started to *feel* it. That there was something *wrong* with the forest itself. Not just the silence, but the way it felt *heavy*, as if the air had weight. Even my own footsteps sounded wrong, dull and muffled, like I was walking on soaked cloth instead of soil.

And the trees… I could have sworn there were more of them. Closer together. Like they’d shifted when I wasn’t looking.

I saw movement once,… something pale between the trunks. I ran toward it, heart pounding, convinced it was a flashlight beam. But when I got there, it was only moonlight glinting on wet bark. The forest didn’t echo my breathing anymore; it absorbed it.

That’s when panic hit.

Not the fast kind that makes you scream and run but the slow, sinking kind, when you realize you might be the only living thing making noise in miles of dark. I started to talk out loud, just to hear *something* “It’s fine. They’re around. It’s just a game.” My voice came back small, swallowed whole by the stillness.

Then, right next to my ear so close I felt the air stir came the whistle.  
Three short. One long.

I spun around, flashlight cutting through black. Nothing.

That’s when I shouted it hoarse, shaking:

“I CAN’T FIND YOU! I’M DONE! I’M GOING TO BED!”

My voice cracked on the last word. I stood there, waiting for laughter, for someone to jump out, for *anything*.

Nothing came.

I walked back toward camp, following my own footprints in the pine needles. The forest stayed utterly still behind me, not a breath of wind. The silence pressed against my back the whole way, like something following just out of sight.

When I finally broke into the clearing, the fire had burned low. The tents were dark. I didn’t see anyone. Just a few dying embers pulsing red, like a heartbeat.

I crawled into my tent and zipped it tight. For a long time, I could still hear the forest breathing outside. Then, softly, just before sleep took me

Three short.  
One long.

Right outside the tent flap.
