Since so many of you have been trading your own run-ins with the creepy and unexplained, I figured it was time to throw my story into the mix.

I’m a Cleaner. For those unfamiliar, that means I’m the poor soul who cleans up after the Wardens finish dealing with supernatural threats. Yes, you heard me—*supernatural*. Turns out all the things people insist aren’t real? Ghosts, monsters, all that jazz? Yeah, they’re out there, and there’s an entire organization keeping them from turning the world into a horror movie. My job is to make sure nobody who wanders into these places afterward ever gets the slightest clue what was really going on.

One night, I was sent out to a run-of-the-mill suburban house. The report said a Warden had neutralized a low-level aberration, and my job was to clean up the mess—erase all the signs that something not-so-human had made itself at home. Standard stuff. I figured I’d be in and out in under an hour.

The house itself was one of those bland, cookie-cutter homes with a trimmed lawn and a “Welcome” mat that screamed *we’re boring and friendly.* But as soon as I stepped inside, I felt it. The air was *wrong.* You know that sensation when you’re alone, but it feels like someone’s watching you from just out of sight? Yeah, it was like that, except cranked up to eleven.

Now, I’ve been doing this for over a decade, so I don’t scare easily anymore. At least, that’s what I told myself as I lugged in my usual gear: a regular flashlight, a UV flashlight, a bucket of industrial bleach, sponges, and a roll of garbage bags. The basics. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was... off.

The main floor and upstairs looked untouched—no signs of struggle, no bloodstains, no shattered furniture. Almost too perfect, like the family who lived here had left in a hurry, mid-breakfast or something. But, hey, when you’ve got a monster squatting in your house, you don’t exactly take the time to pack a bag.

Then I noticed the scratches on the living room floor. Thin, jagged, and leading directly to a bookshelf. Claw marks are pretty standard with these jobs, but these weren’t fresh. They were old—really old. The kind that made me wonder if whatever was here had been lurking for far longer than the report suggested.

The bookshelf, though, caught my attention. It had been moved recently, judging by the scuff marks on the floor. And here’s the thing—people don’t typically rearrange furniture like that over and over. I couldn’t help myself. Against every protocol drilled into me, I decided to give the shelf a tug.

It swung open like a door, revealing a narrow staircase descending into darkness.

Now, any sane person would’ve stopped there. Called it in. Waited for backup. But I guess curiosity got the better of me—or maybe it was just stupidity. Either way, I started down the stairs, one creaky step at a time, flashlight in hand. The deeper I went, the colder it got. Not normal basement cold—this was the kind of chill that sinks into your bones and makes your stomach twist.

At the bottom, my flashlight cut through the pitch-black to reveal a small, dirt-floor basement with brick walls. The air was heavy, like something was pressing down on me, and as I swung the light around, I heard it: a faint, raspy rustling in the corner.

I froze. My brain screamed at me to run, but I couldn’t move. Slowly, I turned the light toward the sound, and there it was. A gaunt, humanoid figure, its hollow eyes locked on me. Its skin wasn’t really skin—it rippled, like shadows trapped just beneath the surface.

The moment our eyes met, a wave of pure, unfiltered dread hit me. Not normal fear—this was primal, suffocating. My heart was pounding so loud I thought it might give out right then and there. The thing started to shift, its movements jerky and unnatural, as if it was testing how much of itself it could show before I completely lost it.

And that’s when I realized—it was feeding on my fear.

The more terrified I got, the stronger it became. Its sunken face twisted into this grotesque grin, and it began to inch toward me. I fumbled for something, *anything* on my belt to use, but all I found was a bleach-soaked rag. Not exactly monster-slaying material, but desperate times, right?

I hurled the rag at it, more out of panic than strategy, and by some miracle, it hit the thing square in the face. The reaction was immediate. It let out this inhuman screech as smoke rose from its skin, the bleach burning it like acid. The oppressive fear gripping my mind shattered, and with it, my paralysis.

I bolted. I didn’t stop to think or look back. I flew up the stairs, slammed the bookshelf shut behind me, and shoved the nearest couch in front of it for good measure.

After catching my breath, I called the Association. They sent a couple of Wardens to deal with it properly. Turns out, it was a Manananggal—something out of Filipino folklore. It feeds on fear, nests in hidden places, and quietly preys on unsuspecting families.

How long had it been there? Who knows. My best guess? The basement had been sealed off and forgotten for years, giving the creature the perfect hideout. It must’ve dug its way in and started feasting on the family bit by bit, maybe even creeping into their rooms at night.

The thought still makes my skin crawl.

So, let this be a warning: the next time you think you’re safe in your own home, remember—sometimes the real monsters aren’t under your bed. They’re behind the walls, watching, waiting.
