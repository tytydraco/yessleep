31 Year old male here. Throwaway account because who knows if this guy is on the internet. Not really sure how to put all of this out into words. To be honest, I'm not sure if I even should be freaked out about this, but I am. I just need advice on how to handle it and I heard this was an okay place to come ask. I was never much of a writer, but this whole situation has put me into a really messed up headspace. One of those things that fills your head up so much that you need to tell someone in hopes it will relieve some of the pressure, you know? So please excuse if this whole thing reads a little awkward, I'm trying my best lol.

This started a month ago when I finally bought my own house. It took blood, sweat, and a hell of a lot of tears, but after promotions, after new companies and new owners of old companies and riding a desk for almost a decade, here I am. A dusty, ramshackle little 2 bed 1 bath in bumblefuck nowhere Arizona. Lucky me, I know, a life of luxury I live. But I was, and still in most ways am, really happy and proud to finally have a place I can call mine. A place without roommates, where the messes I make are mine and mine alone to not clean up. I did a bunch of looking, budgeting, lowering the prices on Zillow until there were no search results, but finally a house came up on the market. When I say this place was dirt cheap, I mean it. I couldn't get an apartment in town for half the monthly I'm paying on this place. When I saw it, I actually dragged my roommate to my computer screen to look at it. (RIP his gaming buddies. They lost the match, sorry guys)

  
  
Roomie: "Dude! What the hell?"

  
  
Me: "No no man, you HAVE to look at the price on this place! 2 Bed, 1 Bath, for basically squat!"

  
  
When he looked at the screen, I admit, I did feel a bit of excitement drain from me. Sometimes it takes others eyes on a thing to confirm some of the worries you were keeping locked away under the hype. 

  
  
Roomie: "Thiiis place looks kinda battered, dude.”

  
  
Me: "I mean... yeah, a little, but still!"

  
  
Roomie: "And it's waaaaay out there, did you not check the address on GPS?"

  
  
Me: "Look,man. It's four walls, a toilet, and running water! It's not that far out, and I'll only end up paying, like, 100 more a month there than here for a full place to myself."

  
  
Roomie: "What's wrong with here?"

  
  
There was a bit of a pause, before both of us couldn't hold back any longer and started laughing. Picking himself up off of the floor after rolling around on the ground in the loudest, most "noise complaint"-y fake laughing fit I've ever seen (though it was pretty funny), he clapped me on the shoulder and smiled. 

  
  
Roomie: "I mean hey dude: it's a shithole, but it'll be your shithole."

  
  
I laughed a bit, but in a way, that jab actually made me kind of proud. Because he was right: it may not be the nicest spot in the world, but it's mine. 

  
  
I scheduled with the real estate people the next morning, and got the appointment set up for the following Thursday to go check the place out. The woman on the phone sounded real excited to get the call about the place, and to be honest, it kinda worried me. I remember telling my roommate it might have been worse than the photos had shown, and he lectured me on how to spot different kinds of mold, termite tracks, bed bugs, stuff like that. When I loaded up into my car that Thursday, I admit, I was a lot less excited than I started out. 

  
  
I drove out to the spot, and the drive was a lot longer than I thought. Not in actual time, the 33 minutes on the GPS was pretty much accurate to the second, but the length of the drive. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but sometimes when you're driving through a whole heap of nothing for more than 5 minutes time starts to dilate, and half an hour takes a quarter of a century. It actually got to the point I started noticing entirely banal details about my barren surroundings, like that there was only a street lamp every half a mile or so. The rest of the drive, I figured, would be completely dark at night. I made a mental note to be careful of coyotes and rabbits when driving out here at night, since out here they're a pretty common sight. As I looked out, I started to picture what it would look like out here in the dark. Complete, void darkness, dotted occasionally with lights that would be on at all these properties a mile away from each other. I could almost see it then, like all of the things I could see at that moment that would be completely hidden from my view when there was nothing to light them up but the moon.

  
  
I got a call that sort of startled me out of the trance I had fallen into. I realized in that moment that I had been just absentmindedly staring out of the windshield at the area around me, picturing the inky blackness swallowing the light from my high beams. When I blinked, it was almost like I had that thing where you stare at light and can still see the shape of light sources superimposed in your vision, in the shape of headlights that weren't even on.

  
  
I picked up the call.

  
  
"Mr. Randall!" Cindy, my realtor, is a really chipper gal. She's nice, but she has that "real estate plastic smile" kind of energy that has always sort of put me off. I'm a pretty quiet guy, so when you put me next to a very boisterous person like Cindy I start to feel like an alien, or Edward Scissorhands weirdly enough.

  
  
Me: "Oh, hey Cindy. What's up?"

  
  
Cindy: "Was that your orange truck that just rolled by? I'm back here on Newberry! By the church?"

&#x200B;

I was confused. I hadn't passed a church, at least not that I had seen. I looked at my GPS.

  
  
It was telling me to turn around.

  
  
Me: "Uhhh... weird, sorry. My GPS must have fritzed, sorry I was sort of zoned out."

  
  
Cindy: "Easy thing to do out here. All this space, the open air, the mountains on the horizon, such lovely views in all directions!"

  
  
I wish I could see the world with the beauty that Cindy seems to be able to. All I had been looking at was the knotted, dead trees sitting crooked and the hundreds of tumbleweeds lying in clumps tangled with trash. I didn't say any of that, though. I just wheeled my car around and headed back toward where my GPS said Newberry street was.

  
  
Coming over the hill, I looked a bit further down and saw the church Cindy had mentioned. I had no idea how I'd missed it, to be perfectly honest. The thing was massive, looked like something out of an old western movie. Big triangle-shaped front porch that you walked up a couple steps to get to the rotting front doors. Above the entrance, stretching perilously up into the dry Arizona sky was a bell tower, but you could see through the little windows there was no bell hanging inside. Just a rope, dangling down off of the rod that twists to ring it when a bell is attached. I remember being curious about it, because the church looked like it hadn't been touched in at least a decade, but I could swear that the rope was one of those colorful orange ones, bright and new rather than some big, old horse-hair thing or anything that would be more on-theme.

  
  
I pulled into the little dirt lot beside the church and there, standing in a navy blue suit, big red hoops dangling from her ears, was Cindy standing next to her Range Rover. Cindy is a very pretty woman, somewhere in her early forties I think, whose only physical flaw is that giant, fake smile. Sometimes I feel like she has to know that it does not look in any way friendly, and more reminds me of something you'd expect to see through grainy footage in a "Scariest Videos Ever Recorded!" compilation. As I step down out of my truck, she walks over to me. 

  
  
Cindy: "Mr. Randall, glad you found your way! Hope the drive wasn't too taxing."

  
  
Me: "Oh no not at all!" (It was) "Why uh... why are we stopped here? I thought that was the house over there."

  
  
I pointed out about 100 yards behind her a little blue house surrounded by a rickety wooden fence that I recognized from the ads. She glanced back and returned with that megawatt smile.

  
  
Cindy: "Oh it is! It's just a bit of a walk to get over there, the trails to the house are a little thin and a lot bumpy so it's best to just walk it."

  
  
I looked at the trails, and my jaw almost fell off of the rest of my skull. A better way to describe these "trails" would have been "hair-thin strips of dirt between foliage, tumbleweeds, and a metropolitan city's worth of random garbage. I think she saw the look I was trying to hide and quickly added,

  
  
Cindy: "It's not like that close to the house, but the property owners here at the church do let things get a bit wild around the clearing."

  
  
I sucked a slow sigh through my teeth and turned to face her fully. I think I was about to ask something about the lack of any pictures of a washing machine in the ads when I saw it. Across the road from the church, to the South, a little ways down, there was a building. The place almost looked like it was built out of chunks of plywood and duct tape. That way that an unkempt new-age building just falls apart into a collision of video game item textures. But the disrepair of the place isn't what caught my eye. It was the words spray painted across the boards on the smashed out windows that made me pause.

  
  
It was the address of the house. My house. With the words "309 FEET NORTH" beside it.

  
  
I pointed to it, not quite sure what flavor of "what in the hell is going on there?" I should use. She followed my gesture and looked across the street. She laughed. I didn’t.

  
  
Cindy: "Right! Sorry about that! People have been dropping by to try and look at the house, and I suppose the GPS gets a little funky and keeps taking people to the lot next to that place instead of this one. People pull up there and start looking around thinking it's the house, and we've received complaints about it from the property owner. Suppose he decided to do something himself"

  
  
Me: "The property owner? You mean someone lives in there?"

  
  
Cindy: "Not that we know of. The guy who owns it only seems to come by every so often, I've seen his truck outside. But every time I have a viewing and the client tells me they ended up there, the office gets a call from the guy. We do what we can on our end but it still happens"

  
  
I make a mental note to talk with the guy if I buy the house and ask him to cover the words. I wasn't sure why it bothered me, honestly, I mean there's nobody out here to see it. Even if there was, it's just the wrong address spray painted onto a house that's like a football field from the right one so why do I care so much?

  
  
We walked up the weird trails to the house, and to her credit, Cindy was right. About 30 or so feet around the house an area had been cleared out and turned into what was effectively a dirt track encircling the property. I was appreciative of whoever had worked the area, since it meant an easier time keeping all of the debris and trash from blowing in and getting stuck on what would be my property. The place was surrounded by a picket fence, big wooden slats with triangular tops forming a barrier between the house and the miles of desert beyond it. The fence was, admittedly, in pretty severe disrepair, but I figured I'd take it on as a weekend project and just make sure to keep my dog in at night in case of coyotes. So far, aside from the nearby area, I was liking the property.

  
  
This didn't change at all when we got into the house. The inside was completely newly done, all the paint was brand new, the wood floors had clearly been replaced. There was even a roll of drop sheets off in the corner of the room by the fridge. She took me around the house, showing me the bathroom, the master bedroom, the closets. She spent minutes gushing over the newfangled refrigerator with a touchpad on the door, the electric stove, and the various kitchen appliances that, apparently, came with the house. Never had a blender before, so I didn't question it too hard. 

  
  
As we walked out of the bathroom and down a short hallway into the side bedroom, I stopped and turned to look at the wall as something grabbed my attention. There, just on the corner that turned off down the hall toward the room, were little black marks in sharpie. Lines, drawn perpendicular to the corner, with names written beside them. "Waylon. Leslie. Ilia." I remember thinking the marks were a bit tall for kids still getting their names written, and that there was only one mark for each kid. 

  
  
"Hey Cindy", I called out, pointing to the writing on the wall. "What's up with this?"

  
  
She turned around and walked up to the writing, looking at it with a puzzled expression.

  
  
Cindy: "That's weird, I figured the paint would have covered them."

  
  
Me: "I guess whoever did the painting for you guys did a rough job. Doesn't even look faded to me."

  
  
To be truthful, I didn't care that there was writing on the wall. It could have been a drawing of Jesus or a middle finger, wouldn't bother me any. But since I was going to be paying for the place, a part of me I guess wanted to bring up everything I noticed to either get a better deal on the place or at least to spot things I could have the company come and fix later. 

  
  
Cindy: "I'm sorry about that sir, I'm really not sure how that got missed."

  
  
Me: "It's fine. But I thought you said you'd had people coming through the place to check it out, wouldn't you have noticed it?"

  
  
Cindy looked a little caught out in the wind for a moment, and it seemed as though I had caught her in a lie of some sort. I got a little worried at what I may have just uncovered.

  
  
Cindy: "Well we have, Mr. Randall, but only before renovations were done on the house. It has been off of the market for a couple of months pending the remodel in hopes it will sell better that way."

  
  
I supposed I was lucky, then, that this newly redone place had been so impossibly far out of town that nobody would buy it. I began to grow curious, however, at what the place had looked like before I had gotten there.

  
  
Me: "So the previous owner had kids then?" I asked, trying to make conversation while we were inspecting the impressive four blank walls and new carpet of the second bedroom.

  
  
Cindy: "Grandkids, I believe. From what I've heard, he was an older gentleman who only lived here about 5 years before his passing. His grandson is the one who inherited the place and then put it out on the market."

  
  
Another reason the place must be so cheap, I thought. This kid probably put this thing up for sale as fast as he got the deed. No love for grandpa's old place I suppose. I wondered which name was the new property owners, and how he would feel knowing it was still written there, 

  
  
Me: "Right. How did he pass?"

  
  
Cindy: "I'm sorry?"

  
  
Me: "How did he pass away?"

  
  
The high beam smile switched off like a light switch. Like a little gnome in her head hit the "new emotion" button, and now she was looking at me with a grave face. "Natural causes. From what I was told he died peacefully in his sleep, and was found a few days later by his daughter when she came by to visit."

  
  
I was a little creeped out to be sleeping in a house that had so recently known death, but the dollar signs, or lack thereof in this case, kept me locked in. I was happy to put the down payment on the place as soon as Cindy would let me. The moment I got the green light, I loaded up a truck, paid my old roommate 40 bucks to help me lug all my stuff, and suddenly me and my whole life were on the road out into, as my roommate called it, "the boonies".

  
  
Now when you live out in the desert, and you have to do things like manual labor, during the summer you wait until the sun is starting to go down. Hard as it is to work in the dark, buying a few headlights and some of the bigger flashlights is a cheaper price to pay than passing out from heatstroke while wheeling a wardrobe backward down a truck ramp. So when we loaded up all of my stuff in the back of my truck, the sun had been just setting out over the mountains. The sky, at the time, was beautiful. Long, fluffy clouds streaking orange across a sky of slowly shifting pink and purple. I remember looking up at it all and thinking it was a nice view to begin a new chapter of my life.

  
  
By the time we started driving, all the vibrant colors of sunset had faded and died out into insurmountable blackness in every direction.

  
  
Driving out into the desert, it was impossible to keep my roommate’s comments packed away. 

  
  
Roomie: “You know, there was about 5 seconds where I thought about asking to move in with you, cut the cost even more.”

  
  
Me: “Defeats the purpose, though. I mean… no offense, bro, but I need my own place.”

  
  
Roomie: “No no I know, and now… Well I’m glad I didn’t ask.”

  
  
Me: “Oh? Why’s that then?”

  
  
He gestured out at the desert around us. I was honestly trying not to look around too much. I already knew what the darkness looked like out here, like I had already become acclimated to it. I wasn’t quite sure why, seeing as I had never been out this way at night before, but it was like I already knew all of the minute details of this area in the dark. The certainty of it made me uneasy. Any time I’ve been in a new place that doesn’t feel new, I’ve always tried to get the hell out of dodge ASAP. But now I had some serious money put down out here so… live and let lie.

  
  
Roomie: “But you said the place was nice on the inside?”

  
  
Me: “Oh yeah, man. All new stuff, new paint, new floors, some appliances. No furniture, which is why we have to haul mine over there, but all things considered it’s stupidly nice for what it is.”

  
  
Roomie: “Yeah I guess. You’ll just have to get used to the driving time. But you could totally get lost in thought driving out here. I mean, we haven’t hit a corner in like 15 minutes, and according to the GPS we’re not gonna.”

  
  
Me: “Yeah no, we just follow this road until we hit the church, and we’re good.”

  
  
Roomie: “Wait, church? What church?”

  
  
Me: “There’s this run down old western church out there, like right by my house. Looks abandoned, definitely not having services or anything there.”

  
  
Roomie: “Oh wow. How incredibly normal and not at all creepy.”

  
  
Me: “Dude it’s a church. This isn’t the Exorcist, it’s literally just a big, old building. Scariest thing about it will be when it eventually topples over onto my car.”

  
  
Roomie: “Yeah that’s another thing… you didn’t mention the walk before you paid me. I think my rate just went up.”

  
  
We arrived about an hour after sunset, and by that time the sun had completely drained past the horizon and given way to the most singularly astounding sky I’ve ever seen. I think the best part about living in this place, far and away, is the sky at night. I’ve never seen so many stars. You’re so far out that the light pollution from the city doesn’t mess with your view, and you can stare out through your own little window to infinity. Even my roommate was awestruck by it. We made plans to get a bonfire going out here some day, and just drink under the stars by the fire. 

  
  
I’m not sure I will ever go outside at night out here again.

  
  
The work was grueling trying to get all of my stuff through those thin, winding trails up to the house. I lost a couple of things to one of us tripping and dropping them onto the jagged rocks that littered the ground. I still have it, but my bedside table has a nice big crack and dent in the side now courtesy of an old car seat that was just laying there waiting to get tripped over. After 4 or 5 hours of working into the night, we finally hauled my mattress into the house and got it set up on the rickety little bedframe that I had built.

  
  
As I was fitting my sheets over it, and looking around for the box I had shoved my pillows into, my old roommate walked over to the window and flicked open the blinds with one finger. 

  
  
Roomie: “Well hey, if you put your desk under the window, you can look down to the street while you work. Maybe people won’t end up sitting outside waiting for you for 45 minutes.”

  
  
I had a bad habit of not checking my phone when waiting on company.

  
  
I glanced out, and a chill ran down my spine. There, straight outside my window, I could see it. 

  
  
“309 FEET NORTH”

  
  
The building with my address scrawled across the front of it was right outside of my window. I’m not sure my roommate noticed it in the dark, but I did. The moonlight barely lit it up, it stood as a looming, dark structure that was so destroyed that in the dark you could barely figure out what you were looking at. But still, my eyes having already scanned the place in the light, I could make out the words written there. I stepped away from the window, clearing my throat in hopes that the knot in it would untie itself. I couldn’t manage much more of a response than “yeah.”

  
  
That night, I let him crash on the floor in my living room because I didn’t want to drive him all the way back that late. Figured it would be easier to take him to work the next morning on the way to my job. We went and collected the 12 pack of beer I had purchased in town out of the cab of my truck and sat out under the stars drinking. I didn’t have a fire pit yet, so we couldn’t get that part going that night, but we still enjoyed chin-wagging in the moonlight with our drinks, reminiscing about a life I was moving on from. It was sweet, and one of my favorite memories with him to this day. 

&#x200B;

That night, I woke up to the sound of wings flapping. I wasn’t sure what had stirred me, but I knew I could hear it. Rhythmic, and passing by as though flying over or something. shump shump shump SHUMP SHUMP shump shump… I was pretty drunk at this point, and incredibly tired, so I wasn’t entirely sure of what I was hearing, or if I was hearing it at all. But it kept happening, that same noise. shump shump SHUMP SHUMP shump shump. I rolled over in bed with a groan and knocked out, teleporting myself into the morning and ignoring the owl or whatever was flying around my house..  
  


That first morning I actually didn’t have much time to do anything. I had planned to be up early to do some unpacking, but the previous night’s drinking had made the snooze button look so tantalizing that by the time we woke up, we were basically rushing to get ourselves ready for work. As I threw some toast in the toaster, another amenity of the house that I gladly took, my roommate stepped out onto the back porch to smoke a cigarette. I was just getting ready to head out and join him when I heard him call out to me. 

  
  
Roomie: “Uhhh dude? You go out walking last night?” He asked, chuckling a bit.

  
  
Not sure what he meant, I stepped out the back door to see what he was referring to. I didn’t know what to make of it. There, sitting just outside of my fence boundary on the dirt track, was a pair of dusty running shoes. You could tell that underneath all the dirt they used to be brightly colored, but they were now completely stained a mottled beige-brown. Those shoes had NOT been there the night before, I was sure of it. This was the pathway we took to bring the boxes in, that was the space in the fence we had been walking through. But now there were just these shoes, sitting neatly beside one another, staring at my back door.

  
  
Me: “Uhhh… weird joke, dude.” I said, holding out my fingers to silently bum a cigarette. As he placed one in my hand, he retorted.

  
  
Roomie: “Yeah, I agree. OooOOOooOO spooky Sketchers! OOoOOOoOoOoO!”

  
  
I rolled my eyes and chuckled, assuming this was his concession that he had put the nasty shoes out there for one of his weird jokes that only made sense to him. I didn’t bother thinking too hard about all of it. I wish I had.

  
  
Because that next night was last night and I don’t know how to deal with this.

  
  
I said all of this to basically establish for you all the aches and pains I’ve gone to to move into this place. I can NOT just move out, or sell it, or any of that. Advice like that will be roundly ignored. I need to know what I can do to stay in my home and feel safe.

  
  
Last night, I had shut off all of my lights so I could sit back and watch a movie. New place, new solitude, so I was gonna watch a movie with no headphones on for the first time in years. The TV I bought before moving was pretty big, and had really good sound, so I spent that night housing microwave popcorn, sipping my whisky, and enjoying myself. When the movie ended, the credits started rolling so I hit the mute button on my remote and got up to deal with my dishes. That’s when I heard it. The wings. Although this time I was much more sober, and I could clearly hear what the sound actually was. Footsteps. Quick and steady, like jogging. 

  
  
I felt my heart sink. Who the hell was running past my house at 1 o’clock in the morning? I suddenly felt very exposed by the lack of solid fencing around the house, and started seriously worrying about a burglar or some vagrant on his way to break in. But the longer I listened, the worse I felt. The footsteps weren’t moving towards my place or away from it. They weren’t getting louder or softer. They were just moving. Standing in the middle of my house, with nothing else to make noise, I could hear the sound of someone running in circles around me, out in the dirt.

  
  
I crouched low and creeped up to my front window, which faced out to the West in the direction of town. Way off in the distance I could see the cloud of pollution hovering over the city, lit up by all of the lights and blocking all of its denizens from the stars above. It was this singular source of light that allowed me to see him. A man, jogging around my house on that dirt track. He must have been at least 6’3”, judging by how close he was to being taller than the fence posts. He was wearing a beat up grey hoodie, what I’m thinking were either slacks or those black athletic pants that people wear when they exercise. I only saw him that first time for half a second, but I quickly shifted and went over to the window in my bedroom. One of the only streetlights in the world, it would seem, was down on the road between my house and the shack with the writing on it, and I knew that would backlight him enough for me to find out what I needed to know. I squinted through the blinds at the floor, waiting for the guy to pass, and when he did I got the information I needed to send me spiraling down the mental rabbit hole that led me to type this whole thing out for you guys.

  
  
The shoes. The shoes that were sitting outside my back door that morning. This guy was wearing them now.

  
  
I looked up from his shoes as he continued to jog by, and watched through the broken spaces in the fence. I only dodged out of the window and crawled into bed, heart pounding in my chest, when my eyes adjusted enough to finally see where he was looking. He was looking at my window. He was looking at me.

  
  
This morning the shoes were back where they were yesterday. I don’t know what to do about this. I don’t know if there’s anything I can do. The track is outside of my property, and maybe the guy is just going for a run late at night. But there’s nothing out here. No houses other than mine for at least 6 miles. Just me, the church, and the abandoned building across the road, so where the hell did this guy even come from? Can I call the police about this? Should I buy a gun or something? I need help, so please give me any advice you can. I'll try to answer what questions I can and I’ll keep you guys updated if this keeps happening. Thanks y’all.
