I don’t know if this is the right spot to post this but honestly I don’t care.I need to get this out one way or another, the incident still terrifies me to my core and I feel like with every passing day something might happen to me.I could die tomorrow you never know.I know you read the title and you might think I’m a psychopath or some deranged mental person but trust me I did it out of self defense.None of you can prove a damn thing.I guess I’ll start from the beginning.





It started a long time go I can’t exactly remember the year,month or even day but I do remember being at one of my friends birthday parties, and that’s when I laid eyes on her.Her name was Jessica in case anyone was wondering.The minute I saw her It felt like God had giving me the gift of life.I had little to no experience with women but trust me we started talking to each other and already we liked each other.We start to talk about out interest and all other useless bs.From that day forward I ended up moving out of my parents house and moved into Jessica’s house It was also that time when we started to actually date each other It was the best thing of my life, my friends and even Jessica’s  family and friends were very supportive of us, well except my parents they were very against  me and Jessica’s relationship.There were even times where they would make very extreme threats to Jessica and Me especially, but I didn’t care what they said as long as I was happy with my woman I knew we would be together forever.





We ended dating for a full year It wasn’t until we went to our local park, we would usually go there after work to relive stress.It was on that very day where I proposed to Jessica and she said yes without any hesitation.Soon after that we got married and had our marriage ceremony once again it was the best time of my life.It wasn’t until where things started to get let’s say very argumentative.






Let me give you some brief backstory of mine.When I was a teenager and into my early twenties,I had a huge alcohol problem
(I know I had a fucked up life) and that’s where the problems began.It was so bad to the point where I would have 6 to 7 drinks a day and I still have that problem today.When Jessica found out about it let’s just say it turned into a shitshow.Me and her would argue almost every single day about it and there were even times where I would get dressed and leave the house without saying a word to her, even when she asked plenty of times of why I was leaving I would just ignore her completely and would usually drive over to my friends house either to spend the night or just to hang out.There was even a conversation I had with my friend about Jessica and her bitchy attitude If I remember it correctly this is how it went.





Me:”Yeah man I had to leave Jessica was just being a bitch”

My Friend:”I know but if you want to stop fighting with her than quit your alcoholic problems if not it’s only gonna get worse”

Me:”Yeah whatever man I’ll think about”

My Friend:”Look I just wanna make sure you’re alright  you know something bad can happen to you or even Jess”

Me:”Definitely I’ll think about it see you later”


That’s basically how every conversation went every time I went to my friend’s house we always had a conversation about Jessica and what to do but honestly my friend was the least of my worries.When I got home I immediately saw Jessica sitting on the couch, giving me  this death stare as a walked in then she started to ask me where I’ve been at and If I was having a affair with some other girl.I told her it wasn’t a big deal and that I was at  friend’s house,as soon as I sat on the couch but she thought was lying and kept poking at it and poking at it that’s when I had enough.Me and Jessica started going at it again and this is where all hell broke loose, during our argument Jessica slaps me across the face so hard it left a mark on my left cheek and yelled at me saying that I had to stop my drinking habits or else she was going to file a divorce, when I heard I got really pissed off.I then grabbed one of the bottles and smashed her in the face with it.I smacked her so hard the bottle ended being broken completely and also the fact that the minute I hit her, Jessica was already unconscious.



I then decided that I had to finish the deed.I snatched one of the broken glass shards from the bottle and began stabbing her with it, she barley had anytime to react or even scream it took a few minutes but finally she layed their dead on my living room carpet, blood was everywhere even on my carpet and on some of my clothes.I then fell into some sort of trance I couldn’t describe it well, but it felt good.Thats when I started to laugh and cry hysterically at the same.I knew I had accomplished my goal, after a solid five minutes of me laughing and crying I wiped the tears from my face and begin to pick up Jessica’s limp body.I carried her all the way to my backward and layed her down softly on the grass.While she layed there I grabbed one of my shovels that were in the garage and started to dig up a hole.It took longer than I thought but hey It was worth it.I then picked up her body again and threw her into the hole and started to dig again, it longer than I needed to but again I was happy.I was finally done and went back inside the house took off my clothes and immediately went into the shower, you when they say that blood is hard to clean off well I didn’t have a problem when I got out I was as good as new and then started to clean up the carpet again it didn’t take that long, after that I was done I saw Jessica’s phone was ringing when I checked I saw that it was from one of her close friends I didn’t pick up though.I just went to my room and immediately went to sleep preparing to go to work the next day.



Fast forward to when I got to work I was typing some random thing on the keyboard I then saw a familiar person walk up to me.It was one of Jessica’s close friends her name was Ava, she worked in the same department as me but we really didn’t talk to each other that much, the only time we ever talked to each other was about Me and Jessica’s relationship.So when I saw her walk up to my desk I knew something was wrong “Hey Conner have you heard from Jess by chance, I’ve been calling her phone nonstop and she hasn’t answered any of them, do you know if she is alright?” Ava said in a very concerning tone.I answered her with a dumb excuse telling her that me and Jessica broke up and she ended up moving away.Ava than gave me a nod and then casually walks away without saying a word.I didn’t think about it much and just went back to work.




When my shift was done I got into my car and started driving home, fast forward to when I got home I took of my work clothes and switched into my pajamas and sat on couch, while having a drink or two to relive my stress.I decided to turn on the news to see what was going on and I what I saw made my heart turn into complete ice.I saw a picture of Jessica on a news station, at first I thought I my eyes were playing some sick sadistic trick me but I knew it was real, every news station that I switched to the news anchors were talking about Jessica and showing one or two pictures of her,but the worst part was she was reported as a missing person.I immediately turned off the tv I couldn’t take it much longer I just sat there wondering what I just saw.I didn’t have enough time to reminisce though.I then heard a knock coming from my door, at first I thought it was some random stranger who had the wrong house so I didn’t answer, that’s when I heard the knocks again this time it was a lot more louder.I then I had no choice but to answer it when I opened the door, I saw three cops standing right in front of me two of them were male and one of them were female one of the male officers asked me if I saw a woman named Jessica in the area.I hesitated for a moment but just blurred out the first thing that came to mind “Um I know nothing about it I’m sorry” I said.The female cop than tells a thank you and that I have a good as they leave the front porch.I closed the door afterwards trying to pretend none of this even happened.



But after that day my life has turned completely upside down for the worst, It first happened when I started to hear voices in my head but they weren’t your typical scary voices but this one was special and not in a good way.The voices sounded familiar and it sounded like Jessica’s voice but it wasn’t her sweet and calming voice instead it sounded more demonic and it just kept going and going and going and it just kept getting worse her voice started to chant incomprehensible things and it didn’t get better.The first bad thing that happened was that everyone that I known in my life even my parents had cut me entirely and there were also times where I would have sleepless nights and wake up the next day with my eyes being completely bloodshot red.Another bad thing that was I ended being fired from my job due to my lack of time being there.I couldn’t find another job no matter how hard I tried.I was a nobody it was wasn’t until the voices f Jessica came back again but this time the voice sounded a little more clearer and in a harsh and demonic tone she said “Do it” and just kept repeating the same thing over and over again and also there were times where during my sleep I would start to laugh manically it was hell to say the least.




Now it’s the present day and I really need your help the voices of Jessica just keep coming back and I’m not sure if I can handle it anymore.I’ve been thinking about committing suicide for the longest time but I couldn’t bring myself to do it not even my alcohol could save me, please if any of you have advise of what I should do, I would really appreciate it.The thought of suicide has lingered in my mind for so long and I honestly think I have no choice but to do it so once again if any of you have advise it will mean the world to me.I don’t know if I’ll ever update this but I’ll think about it

I guess I’ll see you if I ever update this.



Regards:Conner
