Do you think Spirit/ghost Possession is real?  


In 2018, i joined scout organization at one of the police departement in my country, at some point they made a camping trip to a much rural area in my town, i dont know what kind of place that is but its like a closed woody field with big swamp/lake? the front gate near the main road and theres one family house in that rather closed area so we dont think much.

  
One night, one of the camp programs require all of us to do al-quran recitation (my country full with muslims), but in the middle of recitation theres this one girl get possesed really bad, i mean seriously, she start to aggressively laugh and cry like a maniac forcing us to stop the recitation, tens of men consist of my seniors and elders cant hold her still, everybody got scared and panic, to make things worse, one by one all of the girls in the camp get possesed too... literally one by one the girls fall unconcious and start to scream, like a really heavy scream, they still can talk, and i swear one of the girl i hold said something like "She comes with me!" "She is beutiful like me!", and oh i swear to god maybe this sounds ridiculous but one of the possesed girl is acting like a snake! 

The chaos is immeasurrable, nearly all of the girl is possesed, only god know how terrifying this night is, everything full of screams, crying and weird laughing.

Rain falls down and the seniors who find this camping area get scolded by one of my elders in the middle of the rain. for many hours, one by one the girls calmed down and faint, take them to that family house in the area but this ONE girl that acting like a SNAKE, that spirit just dont want to come out, need couple more hours to just make her back to normal, i dont know what they did, but a little peek i do theres this person like a religious leader recite some mantra or something like a shaman to her for hours, but to strike me an odd, she never scream, she just made a strange "ssss" sound, put her palm together up in the head and wriggling weirdly like a cobra, i swear im not joking this is what i saw with my own two eyes back then.

morning comes, a really long night, many of us theoryze the incident happen because the quran recital we did, the spirit never like holy things, but some elders said its because one of the girls threw their used tampons in the area striking the spirit mad, but the truth is we dont know what exactly trigger the mass possession.

I ask what happened to some of the girls that possesed, they said "i dont know, my body felt like doused in cold water then everything went dark" and the other girl said something like "Everything is dark, then there's this horrible creature, just staring at me."

Some days later after the camping incident, i accidently pass by the front gate of this area, its now closed with thorny wires and sign written in it "Closed area, anyone tresspassing will be punished with imprisonment." weird, its never a dangerous area before this incident.



so tell me what you think, everytime i tell this story everyone just said the girls is drama queen and makes things up, well its making me a bit mad because how bad the girls condition is, they hurt themself, they bruised themself, tens of mens can barely hold them still, and the screams.... its not normal. so what do you guys think? lets discuss it.
