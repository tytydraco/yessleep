Most of the time when you hear about weird kids eating weird things, it’s stuff like paste. Not silica gel packets.

But, growing up, that’s exactly what my childhood best friend Ellis would do each day. I still remember the day that we first met in Grade 1.

I was sitting out in the schoolyard during recess, on the one day that my mom forgot to pack me a snack. Ellis saw me without anything to eat and, without me even asking for anything, handed me a packet of salted pretzels. I smiled awkwardly, stuffed it in the bottom of my schoolbag and then told him apologetically that I don’t like pretzels. We both started laughing and the friendship grew from there.

Ellis shared a lot of interests with me, in that we were both geeky and bookish types who loved sci-fi movies and fantasy novels. We would spend hours talking with each other about our favourite fictional characters.

“You know, the packet says not to eat those” I told him gingerly one lunchtime as he munched away on the moisture-absorbing silica crystals. I pointed to the print saying “WARNING: DO NOT EAT” on one of the synthetic sachets which were included in most snack packaging.

“It’s fine,” he said, tipping the sachet back into his mouth. “It’s actually harmless. They only put that cause it’s a choking hazard—and I know how to chew.”

Unfortunately for Ellis, his unconventional snacking habit didn’t go unnoticed in our grade. It didn’t take for long for other students to notice him eating the silica gel packets and begin making up taunts and jeers about it.

“Ewww, he’s eating that gross white powder stuff” laughed one bully, standing over poor Ellis. “What a freak!”

“Yeah, martian boy, do they eat gel packets back on your home planet?” a girl laughed, waving her hand in front of his glasses.

“I made some science chemicals in the chem lab today, you should drink those too, nerd!” jeered another bully, gawping at the discarded preservative sachet.

This continued over the years of our friendship, befalling Ellis several times a week. They would come over and start giving him hell the second they saw one of those small blue gel packets being pulled out a lunchbox. Ellis was also much nerdier looking than myself, with thick glasses and a wispy frame, which further added to him being targeted.

But despite all this abuse, Ellis wasn’t swayed from his maligned habit. He kept eating those silica gel pouches, chewing them more anxiously, scarfing them down before the bullies saw or consuming them secretly in the bathroom.

Each time that the bullies came over to degrade my best friend, I would avert my gaze, make myself quiet and try not to attract their attention as they laid into Ellis. It was clear from my behaviour that I was embarrassed by my friend’s eating quirk. I didn’t want to look weird too or get targeted by association, so I would never defend Ellis or get involved, even when the bullying turned from verbal to physical.

While I never outright deserted my friend or joined the bullies against him, I never stood up for him. At the time I figured it was his habit, his battle to fight. 

This is something that I came to regret as I grew older. It tormented me, knowing I’d let a good friend suffer out of selfishness. I tossed and turned on some nights, kept up late thinking of all the comebacks I wish I’d said to the bullies in Ellis’ defense. One childhood too late.

Ellis and I matriculated together from elementary school into middle school, but it was high school where we parted ways, with me going to one and him to another. We said fond goodbyes to each other and promised to keep hanging out outside of school, but that promise didn’t pan out as I was swept up in high school life.

It would be years later, when I was well into my 20s, that Ellis finally returned to my mind.

In the middle of watching TV in my apartment one evening, a news report came on that instantly cast my thoughts back to my old friend. And of course it did.

It was about *silica gel packets*. 

They were being discontinued. Specifically, the brand that had been in all our snacks and treats throughout our school days, which is why it was the only brand of silica that Ellis had eaten. According to the news report, the brand—Cryztel—were being discontinued due to severely toxic substances present in them. The news reporter’s words chilled me to my core.

*“They’re a simple part of food packaging designed to keep our food dry. But the question is: are they truly safe? Not those from this local producer of them.

It is being alleged that Cryztel silica gel packets were created with scientific waste products, which were not thoroughly understood by researchers at the time.

Fortunately, foods stored with the packets were protected from this substance by the plastic packaging. It is also not harmful in trace quantities. 

However, we urge anyone who has accidentally consumed this silica gel and is experiencing health issues to contact 9 News.”*

Switching off the TV, my blood ran cold for Ellis. That surely didn’t bode well for his health—that poor kid had eaten several of those sachets everyday for his entire childhood. If they were worried about someone eating an odd packet here or there, what would all *that* do to him?

After all, those sachets were allegedly made from discarded waste products, a byproduct of scientists studying crystallization. Apparently those crystals had vastly more absorbency than normal silica crystals, which is why the company used them to cut corners—but there had to be a tradeoff somewhere.

A terribly sad thought dawned on me as I wondered if my old friend was even still alive. He could have died from this poisoning during the 15 years since I’d seen him, and I’d have no idea. Pulling out my phone, I gave him a quick search on Facebook.

And there was his profile. While populated with few friends, his page looked like it had at least had some activity until earlier this year. The most ominous thing, though, is that there were no profile pictures of him on the page—instead he’d just used various fictional characters’ pictures. His current profile picture? A picture of the Wampa ice monster from Star Wars. And he’d updated that just a few weeks ago.

Well, at least his love for geeky movies hadn’t changed.

I went to bed that night reassuring myself that my old friend was probably fine, and that if he was dead he wouldn’t be updating anything on Facebook. I still couldn’t bring myself to reach out to him, but was content knowing he was likely fine. 

Still, those same nightmares of regret over failing to stick up for him returned to me that night. I saw those same bullies, and was silent as they ripped into him over his habit—one which I know may have cost him his health. However, my torment wouldn’t stay confined to nightmares for long.

The following Monday, I was leaving my office and getting in my car. Just when I was about to shut my door, I caught a glimpse of something over by a pillar in the carpark. Something shiny and jagged, like crystals. Like an entire *body* of crystals. I spun my head around to get a closer look, but it had already ducked back behind the pillar.

Right then probably would have been the best time for me to investigate what I saw. But instead, I dismissed the strange sight as a passerby’s reflection in a chrome car, and pulled out of the parking lot.

I didn’t see the crystal creature in my workplace parking lot again. But this didn’t bring me comfort because, instead, I now started seeing it on my various car rides back home. First on the street outside my office building, then at the intersection further down the road, then at the bus stop past the intersection, then in an alley further into my route. I never saw it for more than a few seconds in the evening dark—but it was unmistakable now.

There existed some kind of stealthy humanoid creature, completely encased in sharp crystals. And even worse, day by day, it was following me home.

I had only seen that glint of synthetic crystalline substance in one place before. But I’d seen it everyday for years. And that was in the silica gel sachets Elllis would dig into daily. I could put two and two together. The news report about my friend’s crystal snack being toxic and the strange crystal monster stalking me.

Again, I jumped online at home and started looking old schoolmates up. But this time, instead of Ellis, it was the names of the kids who had bullied him. Their little gang had been made up of about five people, and it only now occurred to me that I hadn’t heard anything concerning them for years.

Searching each of their names, I was shocked to see obituaries. Roy, the leader, had been butchered in his sleep in an unsolved home invasion. Shauna, another of the crew, had suffered a similar fate, having her body ripped apart by an intruder while her family slept. One by one, I learned of each of the animalistic and brutal killings, with descriptions of the former bullies having their flesh pierced and shredded. 

Found on each of the bodies, and in their wounds, was a crystal substance. Authorities suspected it was a drug of some kind used by a junkie assailant. I knew instead that it had come from the jagged limbs of the killer itself.

I also now knew one more thing: that the creature that had done these killings, my old buddy, had one final target it was coming to kill. He wanted revenge against me for not standing up for him.

Helplessness could have consumed me at that moment. But I fought to keep myself rational and calm. Ellis had only killed its targets while they were in bed sleeping, I recalled. It had likely needed to catch them unawares, because it was too physically fragile to kill them otherwise. If Ellis came anywhere near me while I was awake, I would have the power to injure or—if need be—kill him.

It hurt me to think about my old pal like that. But I wasn’t going to let him savage me while I slept, interrupt my guilty nightmares about him with a real one.

That night, I reinforced the door to my apartment with multiple locks and a security alarm. I also made the doorman aware of a deformed intruder which may attempt to force its way up to my apartment—leaving out the part about it being a literal crystal monster, of course.

Finally, I left a baseball bat near my bedside table. One hit from that would turn my vengeful monstrified friend into a pile of glass. 

I don’t know how I managed to doze off that night, knowing what lay outside coming to kill me. But I somehow did, revisiting my standard regretful dreams. This time, I was one of the bullies, joining in on insulting Ellis. In his eyes, I might as well have been.

Suddenly, I was startled awake by the sound of a cupboard door slamming. It was my closet door. I looked up, eyes groggy in the lamplight, and finally saw him up close. Ellis.

The creature was horrific, composed of flesh warped into numerous white crystal shards jutting from his body at all angles—as if he’d been frozen in ice stalactites. But these would never melt off. Underneath the translucent white, I saw nothing of his long-encased, original body.

As it approached my bed, I tried to put my plan into action. But my bat was only knocked to the ground by my shaking hand, rolling underneath the bed.

Transfixed and defenseless, I waited for Ellis to give me what I perhaps deserved.

“I’m sorry, buddy,” I said resolutely. “I’m sorry for what happened to you, and sorry for not protecting you when you needed it.”

The crystal creature barely registered my words, instead reaching underneath the bed. Was he going to bludgeon me with my own bat? 

To my confusion, the shifting mass of crystals stood up, not with my bat, but with my old school bag from elementary. I’d held onto that for years out of sentimentality.

Realisation began to dawn on me as its jagged hand rummaged in the bag before pulling out a very old packet of pretzels. Those sharp hands tore the packet apart with ease, scattering pretzels on the ground, and plucked it out: the *last* Crystelz silica gel sachet in existence.

I watched with awe as it shoved the sachet’s contents into its mouth, like Ellis had every recess, and munched it with crystal shard teeth.

This entire time, it had wanted that discontinued silica sachet, not to violently kill me like Ellis’ bullies. He’d never considered me one of them after all.

With his one purpose sated, this unearthly being my friend had mutated into shambled backwards. Then, very suddenly, it dove out of the open bedroom window it had entered through. A second later the sound of shattering glass echoed from the ground. All that was left of him below was a mass of crystal shards and flesh chunks.

I went back to sleep that night and slept well for the first time in a long time. Safe, and forgiven.
