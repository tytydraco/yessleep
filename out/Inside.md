Fear, an emotion all humans possess, it is nature, it is innate, it is intrinsic, it drives humams towards survival, it saves us, it kills us. As a human, everyone has a fear that is their own, a farmer fears for his crops, a doctor fears for his patients, a mother... A mother fears for her children.

"Andy, don't go out too far, okay? Now go play". I said as I turned away to go back to clean the house. Though I'm worried for Andy, I'm not too worried, she has always been an outdoorsy kid, she'd been like that ever since her late father introduced her to the world beyond our walls.

It was a very mundane day, I did the chores I needed to do, and worked. Thankfully, my job allows me to work from home, as a single mom of a 6 year old child, my superiors allowed me to do so. It was nearing 5:30 PM, and I was worrying for Andy, she always came home before 5 when the sun goes down, but maybe Andy's just having fun like all 6 year olds do. Before my worry became fear however, Andy came strutting down the porch, I could immediately recognize that it was her due to my daughter's unique gait, "Mommy, mommy! Look what I found". She said with a huge grin plastered on her face. It was a round object, no bigger than a tennis ball, it was hard, but it had a smooth texture, it was also warm to the touch. "Honey, baby, where did you find this?" I said inquisitively. "I found it near the lake mommy!". She said delightfully, clearly happy with whatever it is that she found "Baby, didn't I tell you not to go too far? What if you got lost?". I said with a stern voice, "Teehee, I had so much fun mommy, I wanted to explore!". She said happily. I'm fairly certain that I had a stern tone when I scolded her, but no worries, she's a kid, and what better way to learn the world is there than exploring it yourself, right? "Alright, but just this time okay? Now go to the kitchen, I prepared your favorite". Though lamenting on the fact that she was growing up, I'm happy that she's learning how to explore new things on her own.

The next day, I woke up late, and strangely, the rock my daughter handed me was nowhere to be seen, I put it on the nightstand near the bed before we slept but it wasn't there in the morning, I figured Andy Grabbed it before she fell asleep, rightbafter I did, so I paid it no mind. I woke Andy up, and told her to get ready, her school bus is going to arrive anytime soon now, so it's better if she gets ready now. As I sent Andy off to school, I felt somber, "my beautiful daughter is growing up". I say as I sipped on my morning coffee. I went back inside the house and into my makeshift office, a room me and my husband previously decorated as his gaming room. I sat down on his chair, though my husband has been dead for 4 years, his gaming chair is as comfortable as ever, I booted up the computer but it was taking so long, what could possibly have happened for this piece of garbage to start slowing down out of nowhere when it was working perfectly just yesterday. I was working, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that there is something, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I was certain that there was something. "Ugh, for christ's sake, what's with everything today!" I said angrily. "I'll just wait for Andy". The thought of my daughter seemed to cheer me up. A few hours pass by with nothing of interest happening. I was feeling sick, my head infested with migraines and all the other kind of headache, it felt as if my head was being torn apart, being put back together and being torn apart again amd again, though I downed two pieces of tylenol, it didn't seem to help with the pain, not even one bit.

A few hours pass by again, and my daughter finally comes home, and when she did, I welcomed her with a surprise, I hid behind the door which opened towards the inside of the house, it was no problem doing this because she had her own spare key. "Boo" I shouted at her whilst jumping towards her, it did scare her, maybe it scared her a little bit too much, she was bawling her eyes out by the time I realized what I had done. "I'm sorry baby, I didn't mean to scare you" I said, but she didn't reply, she just kept on crying, thus, making me apologize even more profusely. Strangely, I feel great, the migraines suddenly disappeared after my little fiasco with Andy, "What do you wanna eat Andy? I'll cook you my specialty, mommy's sorry okay?" I said, but she didn't reply, she just looked at me, so I took that as a yes.

...

The migraines are back, I can't sleep, I'll grab something to drink, I thought to myself, going to the kitchen, I couldn't help but notice that the floor's awfully sticky, I'm fairly certain that I cleaned up after me and Andy ate together, she was acting weird but maybe she's just upset at me for scaring her earlier. The stickiness turned slimy, and I slipped and fell, my world turned black for a few moments, when I finally woke up, the stench of iron hit my nose, did a pipe leak or something? I finally arrived at the kitchen, I felt very groggy, and the migraine didn't help one bit. The whole kitchen was painted red, there was a red streak going from the kitchen to the bedroom. I turned on the lights, it was a grotesque scene, there were white shards all over the place, I only found out that it was bone after a little bit of thinking, my migraine was gone yet again, which I was thankful for, it made me think clearer, once again, the pungent smell of iron assaulting my nostrils since I woke up intensified. I looked over to the table, it was a mess. Blood still dripping from the table, the viscosity of it was very thick which made it look like solidified amber in the middle of dripping from the tree trunk, but in my case, it was thick blood dripping from the table, The grotesque scene of blood and bones made my brain go overdrive, I thought of all the things that could have made this mess, my thoughts were lightning fast, as if I drank a liter of energy drink. And only then did I think about Andy, Andy, where is my beautiful daughter, I turned around to go back to the bedroom, but my body suddenly didn't want to cooperate with me, nonetheless, I still walked.

I arrived at the bedroom and saw nothing, only the the white sheets that were stained red, where did my daughter go? I could have sworn I slept with her a few hours after we ate dinner, but it's weird, her dinner was still at the table, she didn't eat it. I felt my legs give out, the power residing in my muscles seemingly disappeared, before I fainted, my stomach bloated and it surged, something wanted to come out but I didn't care, I just wanted to see my daughter.
