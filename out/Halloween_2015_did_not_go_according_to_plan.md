What follows is based on my memories.

My name is Ander Webb, I attended a smaller public university in Louisiana, and it was my junior year. At the time I was a contracted cadet in ROTC (Reserved Officer Training Corps). My best friend and roommate Jin Schultz and I would take the freshmen under our wings and mentor them in military, personal, and academic matters. As a pair of currently enlisted Infantrymen, we felt it was our responsibility to look after the new cadets in the program. That fall we had a core group of mentee freshmen, Jake Gilbert and his sandy blonde hair and average height and athletic build, his new girlfriend Harley Caffery who had dark brown hair that was growing out of a scenegirl cut and she was petite, Big Billy(we called him that as he was 6’2” 250-pound guy and a true gentle giant and I cannot remember his last name), and Barry Karnes, average in all aspects. 



Thursday October 29^(th).

ROTC leadership lab was winding down. Training was complete not that most of these cadets needed to know how to conduct the knockout a bunker battle drill.  The cadets were still laughing and commenting on the costumes from the battalion fun run that morning. A Hispanic cadet had painted intricate sugar skull on her face in honor of Día de los Muertos, one ginger cadet came as a fairy princess with tutu, wings, and a pink crown, who am I to judge, Big Billy came as an African warlord, borrowing my maroon Airborne beret to give a “Beasts of no Nation” vibe with the M81 field jacket he borrowed from Jin. Jake came as a famous Tennis player and oddly his girlfriend did not coordinate. Harley came as what looked like a witch drawing symbols on herself and being dressed in black robes. This led Senior Cadet Sarabeth Walker to talk to her off to the side, Walker was very concerned due to her deep Christian faith. Jin and I came as Raiden and Scorpion respectfully from Mortal Kombat as we played as them in our ROTC tournaments and I spammed the teleport move when we’d play Injustice. As the last squads finished their period of instruction, we fell into formation for the weekend safety brief. The Cadet Battalion Commander told us she loved the creativity from the costume run and was happy we took to her idea so enthusiastically. For the safety portion of the safety brief, she reminded us that even though majority of the cadets were civilians still, they should not get into trouble this weekend as that could bar them from contracting as a future officer in the Army.

“Don’t add or subtract from the local population. There: done.” Whispered Jin next to me in formation loud enough our squad could hear but Cadet Battalion Commander up front could not with 3 ranks between us and her. A handful of snorts of laughter responded from our squad and the squad in front of us as the cadets attempted to maintain military bearing.

“Or just don’t get caught.” I replied just for Jin’s ears.

We broke formation after the command to dismiss was given. Jin pulled our mentees aside as I stood next to him.

“Now we don’t care what y’all do this weekend but be safe and smart about it.” Jin started with a caring and authoritative tone.

“Stay with friends and keep a battle buddy, just cause y’all are under the age doesn’t mean we are under the illusion that you won’t be drinking, especially you Karnes, I know your frat has a costume party Saturday.” I said providing my observations of our Cadets’ social lives. Karnes gave a look of fain shock at the insinuation that he was drinking at 18.

Kwan jumped in as if we rehearsed this, we had not, we just spent so much time together we knew when to continue sentences. “If at any point you are in trouble and need a QRF to come save your asses, call me or Webb and we will be there in 7 minutes to anywhere in town or on Campus.”

“Other than that, have a good Halloween this Saturday and see y’all Monday morning for PT.” I concluded just in time as Cadet Walker came over.

“Cadet Webb, Cadet Schultz, Mr. Clark asked me to have you two maintenance and hook up the new propane tank to the grill behind the armory.” She asked in her firm polite way when she would hide her meek nature.

“Of course, he asked for us.” I laughed. “Jin and I always get the ‘hey you tasks’.”

“You two are probably the most reliable and capable cadets we have on campus Ander.” She said dropping the formality in a caring tone that reminded me of when we were close.

Jin turned to us after our mentees left and headed to their cars, “Hey Walker, do you care if Webb comes over Saturday when Annalee and I hang out?”

“Of course not, we can all hang out and watch some scary movies.” If she had any objections to me coming over, she did not show it. Jin was dating Sarabeth’s older sister Annalee. Sarabeth and I had dated at the end of the previous semester. I had spent the past months getting over being sent back to the friendzone by her before our summer apart due to military training. I knew it was over, she was dating a guy 12 years older than us from the city an hour north of campus that was an overly charismatic Christian that made my lukewarm faith look like more heathen than any form of holy. But the continued texting and overly friendly contact for 5 months since the break up made me want to be a better man. Mixed signals are an understatement.

Sarabeth left the armory while Jin and I cleaned the grill and installed the new propane tank to the old gas grill behind the armory that had been in disrepair since we started attending school two years before. I gave it a good test fire with my zippo to ensure it was working too for good measure, the next home game for the football team was in two weeks and we did not want our work to be in vain when the program would be feeding the cadets and veterans at the upcoming Veterans Day game. We jabbed at each other with jokes about everything under the sun as we drove to our apartment across from the campus before cracking open a few Yuengling’s and fired up our Xbox’s for a late night of COD Black Ops II Zombies, and Battlefield 4.

Thus Thursday night went.

Friday October 30^(th).

Friday, I had a couple of classes on Roman, and Medieval history other than that nothing of note occurred. Then there was Halloween. 

Saturday October 31^(st).

The day was about as normal as Halloween in a Louisiana college town could be, 75 degrees and 100% humidity. Jin and I went to Walmart across town to get some food to bring to the Walker sister’s house and liquor to relax with. We were checking out when we saw Harley checking out with what looked like a cutting board and some craft supplies.

“I can’t believe you tried to sleep with her bro.” I jabbed at Jin.

“I can’t either, I wasn’t thinking with my head.” Jin retorted as he bagged the bottle of Jameson from the casher, the “good stuff” our meager Sergeants pay would allow.

“You were, just the wrong one.” I chided back. Jin gave a hearty chuckle at that.

Later that evening we drove my 1997 Ford Explorer over to the Walkers house, a small weathered white house on cinderblocks. Jin and Annalee embraced while Sarabeth and I took the food and drinks to the kitchen in the back.

The evening was enjoyable, played some Settlers of Catan, and the flirtation between Jin and Annalee was hilarious. Sarabeth was on the phone with her boyfriend for most of the evening, while she did that and the happy couple cleaned the dishes together. I took the trash to the curb. I considered grabbing my small pocket Bible out of the center console of my car to appear more pious but decided that was a hollow useless thing to do. After Sarabeth finished her phone call, she suggested that we watch Sleepy Hallow with Johnny Depp. I was apparently the only person that had not seen it, the only horror movie I had seen before was The Exorcist, I did not like scary movies at the time. My male bravado told me to just suck it up as the movie began. Looking back, I was such a little bitch for thinking Sleepy Hallow would be scary, underrated Tim Burton movie honestly. Jin and Annalee cuddled on the couch as I ceded the recliner to Sarabeth and pulled up a dining room chair. The movie was enjoyable, Casper Van Dean had just died on screen (RIP Johnny Rico) when Jin got a phone call, it was around 2200.

He stood up and responded with, “Hey Big Billy, what up bro?” as he rounded the corner of the living room into the kitchen out of earshot. Annalee paused the movie expecting that we would continue it momentarily.

All I heard over Jins pacing was “Wait what? How… what’s that sound? We are coming.”

He strode back into the living room with the grim determination that our profession beat into us, the tone was all business.

“Webb up.”

“What’s going on bud?” I responded as I stood up with the sense of urgency that was felt throughout the room.

“Big Billy called, something's wrong at Harley’s apartment, I’ll brief you enroute.” Jin’s switch from puppy love to mission ready in a second flat, I felt that unease from the beginning of the night and something was up. He turned to Annalee and told her everything is ok and we just needed to teach the freshmen about the importance of pacing themselves at Frat parties. Sarabeth offered a couple bottles of Pedialyte she had for after ruck marches.

“Its ok, I don't think it's needed.” Jin responded politely. I knew he was hiding something from the girls.

I told Sarabeth bye and she grabbed my arm and said, “Something doesn't feel right. Be safe out there.”

I felt my skin tighten as I stood in the doorway as if I was in a freezer, not in the humid night that is the American South.

“It is odd but it’s probably just Jake or Harley discovering Everclear, see you soon.”

Jin and I walked to my car with purpose through the still muggy night, I turned my head and could see both sisters standing in the doorway with the look of concern on their faces. Once my rundown Explorer turned over, I firmly asked, “What are we getting into?”

Jin let a short exhale out and looked at me with a level of concern that I only saw the past summer during the Red River floods when we were activated for high water rescue.

“Head to Harley’s apartment with urgency once we make the corner and are out of sight, don’t scare the girls.”

I put the car in drive and headed to the intersection then gunned it down University Boulevard towards the side of the campus that Harley lived in.

He continued, “Big Billy is at Harley’s apartment trying to help Jake, Barry is leaving his frats party to help him but it's… weird.”

“What’s weird?”

“You got your Bible?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Harley built a Ouija board after we saw her at Walmart this morning and wanted to have some fun with it and Jake thought it would be a fun way to hangout on Halloween. She’s acting strange and Jake’s freaking out and Big Billy is out of his depth.”

I knew this was not a joke. On school breaks and between National Guard training and natural disasters during the summers I worked at Target stocking shelves. There the infamous Ouija boards are sold for ages 8 and up. They would be found in the morning having fallen off the shelf and routinely throughout the day laying on the ground. Both Jin and I were raised by Christian families that instilled in us an understanding of how things like that could open a door that could not be easily closed. Both of us might have lived a heathen lifestyle as young grunts but our upbringing still held, and his Korean mother taught him to avoid the supernatural as one’s soul is easy to lose to other worldly forces.

“What was the weird noise on the phone?” I inquired.

“I don't know.” Jin responded with grim determination.

As we were speeding across campus Jin scanned locations Campus Police were known to sit and wait. I silently hoped they were busy at Greek row and not over by the dorms.

We parked in the first open spot we could find inside the gated dorms 500 feet from Harley’s. I grabbed my Bible from the car and put it in my back pocket and followed Jin to Harley’s Dorm which was on the second floor and closest to the stairs that access the floor. As we approached, we could hear screaming, we looked at each other with hesitance. We were trained to charge into combat but the screams of a girl and the possibility of a God knows what gave us pause, then we knocked.

The screaming stopped. We knocked again, and heard footsteps approaching from behind the door and Big Billy opened it looking exhausted and color drained from his face.

“Guys you’re here, she just stopped fucking screaming and…” Billy rambled off without a breath.

“When, where, and how did this start.” I interrupted.

He pointed at the coffee table that was covered with a handful of crosses and crucifixes. “Harley wanted to summon a ghost and Jake, and I played along with it. That was 30 minutes before I called y’all. Nothing happened until she drew symbols on her arm like she did for the costume run on Thursday. After that, the room got cold, and Harley started acting weird…”

 “Weird how? Details, Billy.” Interrupted Jin.

I could hear Jake in the bedroom talking to Harley with no responses.

“Umm she started to shake then eyes rolled for a couple seconds,” Billy gathered his thoughts, “she then stood up and took the board outside and we did not see where she went. Then she came back and fucking freaked out, she started screaming and muttering some shit Jake and couldn’t understand. She then hit Jake and started to look for something in the kitchen.”

“Jin go check the room with Jake.” I commanded, Jin moved immediately. “Why are there crosses on the table?”

“Jake told me to grab whatever I could to repel whatever was summoned since that’s where it happened.” Billy responded.

A loud scream and impact came from the bedroom; I rushed in with Billy behind me to see Jake standing in the corner with terror on his face and Jin slumped against the wall as if he just got hit by a linebacker. Harley stood next to her bed all 5’1” and 98 pounds of her recoiling after what looked like a shotput throw.

“Harley, where is the board?” I asked in a calm authoritative voice.

“*None of your concern*.” She responded with an unnatural tone compared to her normal docile voice.

Thinking quickly as Jin stood back up, seeing Harley's keys in her right sweatpants pocket, I took a chance asking, “Is it in your car?”

She turned her attention directly to me with a rage in her eyes that confirmed my hunch. Jin saw this too and we knew what came next. Under normal circumstances Jin and my 6’3” 200-pound physique would easily overpower Harley, but as Jin already found out she was stronger than her body should be, she failed every event on the physical fitness test we had taken a month ago which we were helping her improve on. This was going to hurt.

“We need her keys, don’t try to hurt her.” I ordered the men in the room with me, and they understood as Big Billy and Jin lunged at Harley taking an arm each, that was before she tossed Billy off like he was a discarded towel, Jin’s attempt found purchase as he had grasped her left arm, the arm with the strange markings. Jake followed in Billys wake jumping over him as he clung to her right arm. I moved quickly, covering the 8 feet between myself and Harley to body check her into the bed to give us the advantage in this most bizarre struggle. Thinking the upper hand was gained I felt two feet plant on my chest and before I could comprehend what she was doing I was airborne and flew 6 feet landing feet, ass, head on the dorm room’s cheap carpet that did little to soften the uncontrolled fall. Billy, already up rushing past me to achieve control of her legs as I recovered. There was something else at work here. I pushed between Jake and Billy and plunged my hand into her right pants pocket gripping hold of the car keys.

“Got them!” I bellowed, and Jin immediately let go of her arm and we rushed for the door out. Behind us I heard two loud collisions, one against a wall and one I saw the result of, Big Billy once again thrown to the ground. I tossed Harley’s keys to Jin as he passed me in the doorway with him giving me a nod of understanding. He was halfway down the stairs when I vaulted myself over the railing to make up any lost time as I could hear the screams coming for us. Landing as I was trained to as a paratrooper feet, thigh, back and with a roll to keep the momentum I saw Harley coming for me like a predator that was to overwhelm its prey. The atmosphere was no longer still, the trees were being whipped by high winds and the howling was audible like in a thunderstorm. In fully sprint with her gaining I caught sight of Barry coming around the Dorm building's corner.

“What the fucks going on I was hitting it off with a...” He called with an annoyed tone. He must’ve not been given the situation from Big Billy.

“Fucking run!” I bellowed back as I approached him.

He saw Harley giving chase and caught on as he attempted to catch up to me.

“Double back to her apartment to help the guys.” I ordered as we were almost to my car. He split off as Harley stopped 20 feet from me as I slid into my driver’s seat. She screamed a throaty and gut-wrenching bellow that made me wish I had more than a pocketknife on me. She turned and took off in the direction Jin took towards what I assessed to be her car and the infernal Ouija board. I pulled out of the parking space driving parallel to her new direction of pursuit. There was a block of apartment style dorms between us, but I was betting on Jin taking an obscured route back to my car for exfil. I was right that our mutual base level instincts brought him directly to me. I stopped and Jin, carrying what to any casual observer looked to be a cutting board, quickly jumped in the passenger seat.

“Fucking drive bro!” He yelled mere feet from my face as I looked past him and saw the petite figure was 40 feet behind him in relentless pursuit bellowing the same primal roar as before. We took off and whatever being was watching over us must have had some pity on us as the gate was open allowing us to get out of the confined parting lot and on to the street.

“What the fuck was that about? This can’t be what I think it is.” Jin said between labored breaths.

“I am scared it is exactly that, but I am having a really hard time believing it.” I said in response between my own attempts at catching my breath. “Call the Walkers, ask if we can come back and if they have an idea of what to do with this thing, they go to church way more than us.”

Jin dialed Annalee and she picked up on the second ring, “Hey, all’s good.” He lied. “Do y’all mind if we come back over, we have a Ouija board that needs to be destroyed.”

I could hear the shock and rejection of that proposal without the phone being on speaker. Jin tried to argue with what sounded like both sisters as I drove around campus waiting on a plan to form.

“Ok, yeah prayers would be great, and I think we can do that, thanks bye baby.” Jin said, finishing the call. “Well, they don’t want this shit anywhere near them and said their only knowledge of the matter is to burn it and bury the ashes.”

I turned on the next street I saw and without saying a word headed to the ROTC armory.

“Ding”

“Great Harley’s texting me.” Jin said sarcastically, opening his phone. “It says ‘*Do not destroy it, bring it back, you cannot stop what we started.*’ Well that’s concerning.”

I nodded to the phone, “She’s talking in plural now?”

Jin replied with a puzzled reaction reading the latest text, “’*I will not be banished by you, she’s mine.’* Bro what fucked up Supernatural episode are we in?”

“I don’t know bud.” I replied as I pulled sloppily into the lower parking lot of the ROTC Armory.

We rushed up the stairs that connected the parking lot to the porch with the grill. Jin pulled the cover off and tossed me the lighter fluid and I started spraying it on the board.

“Bro there’s no lighter, and she’s calling.” Jin lamented, the pressure was getting to him, I was on edge too.

“Don’t answer her. I’ve got mine in the car.” I responded as I ran down the hill to retrieve my Zippo.

The cacophony of text message notifications and phone call rings could be heard both up and down the hill as the desperation could be felt from whatever Harley had become to get the board back. Jin had placed the board on the grill rack, I could smell the lighter fluid, and he crouched down ready to turn on the gas as I flicked the lighter and held the flame next to the board.

It did not light.

“What to ever loving fuck!” Jin shouted in disbelief. He looked at his phone and read. “*I see you.*” We turned to our west and we could see her dorm a half a mile away across the cross-country track and we realized we had minutes from her arriving if she headed this way.

“Call the guys and tell them keep her distracted.” I told Jin as I gathered pine straw off the ground. He did so and reported, “They see her, and they will keep her from the gate on this side of the dorms, hopefully she can’t jump 15-foot fences.”

With my improvised torch of pine straw, I lit it protecting it from the wind and the flame started, Jin turned the knob on the grill and the propane lite.

The board still wouldn’t light.

“Ander,” Jin said in frustration, barely above a whisper the wind nearly drowned out, “how?”

We stared at the unburnt board, and I pulled out my Bible that was now covered in sweat and moist to the touch after being in my jeans for the past 15 minutes of chaos and flipped through it blindly for something I did not know what. I landed seemingly at random on Matthew 6:9.

I opened my mouth seeing the red text, “Our Father…”

Immediately with the rage of a wildfire the board erupted into flame. Jin threw the grills lid closed, singeing some arm hair in the process.

With a reaction that displayed exhaustion, surprise, and relief he told me, “Keep reading.”

So, I read the rest of the Lord's Prayer, the Beatitudes, Psalm 23, and anything with red text that caught my eye over the sound of the hollowing wind.

After two minutes we opened the lid.

The wood that was the board was charcoal and the vinyl letters that had been glued on melted away, except for the bottom portion that was still perfectly in place but just as blackened and cracked as the rest of the wood, it read “*GOODBYE*.”

I took my knife out, striking downward with the butt of my knife, the board shattered into ash.

“Ding”

Jin looked down at his phone as the wind died down to the calm the night was less than 30 minutes ago. “Harley texted and said, ‘thanks for destroying it.’ How does she know that you just destroyed it?”

“No clue.” I shrugged not wanting to say what I believed in my soul it really was.

We gathered the ashes and buried them in the roots of a tree that fell over during the last hurricane. Called Big Billy after Barry and Jake had not answered, he happily reported Jake was asleep on the couch in their dorm and Harley passed out after the wind stopped and they put her in her own bed and tucked a cross next to her for good measure. Barry apparently went back to his frat party and might be drunk. The Walker sisters were glad we were ok as we left most of the details out. We drove back to our apartment while telling them goodnight over the phone. We got into the apartment and Jin collapsed on to the couch while I walked over to the counter and grabbed the bottle of Jameson, which Jin upon seeing that, reached his hand out in a “bring it here” motion. He opened it and took a long swig as I sunk into the couch next to him. He handed me the bottle, and I took my own deep chug of whiskey.

“Dude I do not know what just happened, lets just forget all of it.” Jin said all energy drained from his voice and demeanor.

“I think it was something very bad.” I responded.

“This shit only happens in horror movies, not in reality.”

“We just saw all that and you’re saying we didn’t experience it?”

The bottle was being passed back and forth like a reverse talking stick.

 “Either way I am going to get drunk and forget about this night.” Jin responded.

“Well I’ll join you in that endeavor brother. Also I think I’m Sam and your Dean.”

“Bet.” Jin replied with his characteristic mischievous nature finally returning.

We finished the bottle and passed out into our separate rooms. From that night nobody talked about it or remembered the details of the night. The Walker sisters did not pry into what we did or what happened to cause an impromptu burning of a Ouija board. Jake and Harley continued dating, why we did not know, but we made plenty of crazy girl jokes as to that. But they never revisited the events of that Halloween night. Jin, to the last day we ever talked in 2020 denied the events of that night ever happened.

It's weird; that night, the night that only I seem to remember at this point, lingers around in my head, like a half remembered dream. Recalling it makes me more concerned and suspicious regarding the nature of what could have possibly come through the door that was open that night.
