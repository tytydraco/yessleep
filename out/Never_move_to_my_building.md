Ever since I was a kid I remember wanting to move to this building. It’s beautiful and modern and it still is now, some 35 years after I first remember it.

I live in a rather large city, 400 thousand people live here. There’s an area of the town with a large avenue and trees and a very nice view of the rest of the city. There stands the Somnium, the building I desired to live in.

It features 25 floors, full of amenities: pools, tennis courts (I guess this was trending when it was built), underground parking, barbecue places, and so on. In an area where the square meter is already very expensive, an entire block is designated to the Somniun with only one tower and every floor has only one apartment with some 250 square meters of area. Every apartment is fully customizable, you can move, remove and install walls all you want. Yet, there are balconies to 3 sides on all floors. It’s a beauty.

As a kid, i knew another boy who lived in the first floor and being there felt so luxurious. My friend didn’t really care much, we were kids after all. “Dad loves here, he said if I make the right choices in life I’ll be able to have my own apartment here or somewhere similar”. We might have been 12 or so when he told me that.

So, I set my sights on living at the Somnium very early in life. And I wanted the top floor. Imagine the view?

As I grew older I found out all the apartments still belong to the building company and are all rented. I found this odd, but not important enough to care, although later in life I’d find out why. 

So by the time I was mid 20s I started dating Debbie and as I approached my thirties, which would come 4 years early for me than for her, we started discussing marriage, future, kids. Also, the Somnium.

“Debbie, I know this may seem kinda strange but there’s one thing that’s important to me. Promise to not think I’m weird?”

“I already think you are weird. Just tell me”

“I know but I fear that if i keep adding to my weirdness you may want to institutionalize me”

“Just tell meeeee!”

“Okay… i would really like to live in the Somnium. You know, the building?”

“Yeah! That place is beautiful. Sounds very expensive though. I heard it’s hard to find a free apartment to rent even”

I never even thought of that. It’s obvious that with 25 apartments there must be some competition.

“Can we even afford that?” She continued

“I hope so. If we can’t, we could build towards it. Is that okay with you?”

“Yeah, fine, if that’s so important to you” Debbie would often be on the side of luxurious dreams. We both were born to simple families and wanted to grow. 

Marriage details aside, we married and I managed to find a realtor who got me an apartment in my dream building. Eight floor. Wasn’t as high as we both expected but we were IN!

We moved and got our space as nice as we could. Rent was expensive but I worked on accounting and Debbie worked in a pet shop. She loves dogs. Naturally we also got ourselves 3 dogs to move in with us. Everything was lovely in the first 3 or so years.

We didn’t share much time with other residents. I actually only caught a glimpse of the guy living on the top floor. I saw him one day I woke up very early and decided to go to the gym. He looked very busy, leaving in a rush. We crossed by the elevator and he was very focused on his phone.

However as time passed, Debbie started to feel more and more depressed. She already had struggled with anxiety but it started taking over her. She didn’t do her share of her home tasks, even after she quit her job. She stoped taking care of her health and even put in some weight. She was rapidly losing her will to do anything. Meanwhile she became angrier, we fought for everything. 

One day she woke up saying she couldn’t take it anymore. Even fighting a lot, this broke me. She said so many despicable things and had so many demands to stay with me, but I don’t want to stray too far from the reason you should avoid the Somnium, so I’ll just mention one time I arrived from work and she was looking at the balcony, in her pijamas, and said “the view from this floor is awful”. She started an argument moments later that ended with a demand to move to a higher floor.

So I saw myself calling the realtor asking if there were any options. “Yes, a couple recently divorced and left floor 15, the view surely is better!”. The realtor showed us the apartment, much to the delight of Debbie who promptly demanded we move up. Even if the rent also went up, and very much on my financial limit. So, we did.

As we were moving boxes, I saw for the second time the person who lived on the top floor. This time he seemed to be in no rush. Tired even. Wearing a hoodie on a Wednesday, 3 PM. He took the elevator with me, never saying a word, looking at the wall, with empty eyes. As I left on my floor I said goodbye to no answer. 

A few days later we finished moving but even the better view didn’t change Debbie’s behavior. I was desperate. “This isn’t the woman i married, the woman I loved”. While trying to figure things out I arrived home on a day to find that she left me and informed me via text. Now, the weight of all this hit me and i started getting depressed myself.

She filed a very angry divorce, the kind they request even half of the forks. My life became a mess and there was just a lot to pay, so I decided to leave the Somnium and live with my parents for a while just to get my finances sorted out. I remembered, as I left the building with one of the boxes, what the realtor said about the divorcing couple. Was that an omen? Couldn’t be right?

Time passed. Even with the trauma I wanted to live there. So when i got myself back up, I called back Jennifer, the realtor, looking for a very “single male” apartment, something like Barney Stinson would live in. 

She had floor 20. At least, well, the view! Can you imagine?

“Who lived there previously, Jennifer? You know, 2 divorces on floor 15. Should I expect something?”

She laughed and answered “not much, the guy from 20 just moved to 25”.

“Well, if that happens to me, I’m totally fine!”

So I went back, with my stuff, my traumas and the weight of a half lived life, with a dream partially come true again. You know how as we grow old, we start to be worn out. This was me. This return wasn’t as romantic as my first time there, a dream. It was more like a goal. A mission to fulfill all I decided when i was a kid.

My new life involved working a lot, and spending less and less time at home. Even with a beautiful apartment, I didn’t really enjoy it that much. My next relationships were always brief and I feared my past would repeat. So my life had become only routine. 

It hit me when I became 39 and I didn’t even register my birthday passed. My life was becoming more and more pointless. It was the day after my birthday when Jennifer called. 25 was free.

Well, at least I could fulfill that. It always looked rainy through the windows in floor 20 so I expected to see more sun on 25 at least. Rent was prohibitive, so I had to work even harder to enjoy even less of my place.

I actually had a Deja vu once, crossing with a moving couple, very early, in a rush to work.

Depression hit me harder and harder as I failed to have any kind of relationship and free time. So, a few moments before I started writing this post as I was contemplating, midweek, in my hoodie, the ceiling fan, looking for a place to tie the noose and I noticed it had several remains of a variety of colors of rope that I found out. Everyone on this building had the same destiny. And I’m about to face mine. So, before you leave more traces of rope on the fan of floor 25, avoid moving to the Somnium at all costs. Goodbye.
