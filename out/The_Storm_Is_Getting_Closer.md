  
**6:00 AM:** Hey, Reddit, the power's out thanks to a storm so I thought I'd go on here to pass the time. Good thing I always keep my phone charged. Plus, I got some battery packs. Hopefully, this blows over soon.   
  
  
**7:00 AM:** I just checked the local weather report on my phone. It looks like it will be a while. On the plus side, work is canceled so I guess I'll browse Youtube for a while or maybe I'll read a book.  
  
**10:00 AM:** Okay, this is weird so I was in the middle of watching the new Dune when I got a text from my friend, Jimmy. He lives a few miles down the road. Here's what it said:   
  
"How's the weather?"  
  
 Now, I thought he was just being funny so I replied:  
  
 "Fantastic, but you might want to wear sunscreen."  
  
I thought nothing of it until he sent this:  
  
  
"The storm is getting closer."  
  
  
And I replied:  
  
  
"The storm has been here. Are you okay?"  
  
  
He didn’t respond so I go back to my movie. Close to the finale, my phone goes off with another notification. This time it's from my Brother, Reggie.   
  
  
"How's the weather?"  
  
  
While replying to it, I thought it was a coincidence.  
  
  
"Not so great, but nothing I can't deal with."  
  
  
I shit you not. This was his reply.  
  
  
"The storm's getting closer."  
  
  
At this point, I thought they were fucking with me and I ignored the message. This was until what happened during the end credits of Dune. My phone went off because it was getting texts from everyone in my contacts even from people I haven't talked to in over a year. If my phone got a virus somehow I'm going to be pissed. I'm going to check it and make sure everything is alright.  
  
  
**NOON:** I'm getting angry. I checked my phone and nothing seems to indicate a virus is present. This didn't answer why I kept getting those cryptic messages so I got the idea to try and contact someone through Messenger. I don't use it often, but I'll admit it's handy. Jimmy is the last person I talked to there so I sent him a message.  
  
  
"Hey, man, if you have been trying to text me, my phone is being weird or it could. be a network glitch. Anyway, hope you are weathering the storm."  
  
  
His response was instant.  
  
  
"Leave while you still can."  
  
  
I replied just as fast.  
  
  
"Why?"  
  
"Leave while you still can."  
  
  
 When I backed out of chat my entire inbox was filled with messages saying what he said verbatim. Back on my prank theory and now incredibly pissed off, I decided to try calling to chew him out. Nothing, just some ringing, then voicemail, and yet Messenger clearly says he is online. I don't know what his problem is, but tomorrow I'm giving him a piece of my mind. In the meantime, I'll be listening to an audiobook.  
  
  
**3:00 PM:** Did I say I was angry?  I meant I was furious. My phone would not stop going off with notifications about those dumbass messages which as you can imagine is pretty damn annoying while you are listening to something. They got so bad I had to download a notification blocker. That didn't stop the vibrating, though.   
  
  
I decided to try calling Jimmy again. Even if it still went to voicemail I could at least leave a colorfully worded message. This time,  though, he picked up.  
  
  
"Jimmy?"  
  
  
No response.  
  
  
"Jimmy!"  
  
  
I may have flown off the handle a bit.  
  
  
"Look, I don't know what the fuck your problem is, but if you and whoever you convinced to fuck with me don't stop, I swear as soon as this shit clears I'm coming over there and popping you across the jaw."  
  
  
The call ended right after that as did the messages so that's that I guess. I still don't understand why they would think this is funny. Maybe they're just bored. I have a portable burner for camping and I'm going to use it to heat a can of chili. Not my first choice, but I am starving.  
  
  
**4:00 PM:** My cat, Herbie, woke up meowing, which meant his fat ass wanted some food. How could I say no to that face? He's on my lap right now as I'm going back to my audiobook. It's The Exorcist and it's pretty good.  
  
  
**5:00 PM:** Herbie kept meowing to go outside. I opened the door and he just stared. Normally I hate when cats do that, but given the weather, it's understandable. Looks like I'll have to break out the litter box.  
  
  
**6:00 PM:** Herbie just flew outside. He already used the bathroom and I was just going outside with an umbrella and a bag full of his litter to put in the trash. When I got back, he shot past me. Why the hell would he do that right after I just got done cleaning his shit? I swear, I’ll never understand cats.  
  
  
I guess it's National Fuck With Kevin Day. Aren't I lucky?  
  
  
**7:00 PM:** Okay, I'm getting a little weirded out now. Herbie came back, soaking wet and shivering. At first, I thought he was just cold. However, when he hissed at me I realized he was scared. This never happens to him and it's why I'm fine letting him go out.   
  
  
Plus, my area's relatively safe. Not even dogs mess with him. I can't imagine what has him so spooked. He's been hiding under the kitchen table for the past hour. Whenever I try to pet him, he hisses at me. Maybe he'll calm down in a bit.  
  
  
**8:00 PM:** God fucking damn it. Again, with these stupid messages. Of course, it was from Jimmy first before everyone and their mother sent it to me.  
  
  
"There is still time."  
  
What the fuck does that mean? Does it mean there's still time for me to drive to Jimmy's and knock him the fuck out? Because if that's the case, I don't want to be made a liar.  
  
  
**9:00 PM:** This was kind of freaky. I was going to leave and head to Jimmy's to confront him. When I went to open the door, Herbie came running in and slammed his front paws on it, meowing like crazy.  This is something else he has never done before. It's the same thing when I try the backdoor.  
  
  
I guess dealing with Jimmy will have to wait.  
  
  
**10:00 PM:** What's with this weather? It started to look like it was dying down, then it picked back up even harder. I swear I could almost hear voices off in the distance earlier. Probably the wind.  
  
  
**10:30 PM:** Now Herbie is scratching at the door to be let back out. Make up your damn mind, cat.   
  
  
**11:00 PM:** What the actual fuck? I know for sure those were voices now. I know because I heard them and they spoke at the same time.  
  
  
"Almost here. Too late."  
  
I don't recognize any of them. Fuck! Something just slammed against my window earlier. I looked out, but I didn't see anything. What the hell is happening?  
  
  
**11:30 PM:** Me and Herbie are getting the fuck out of here. Around 12 after, I went back out just to glance around. Something is coming. I saw it, a bunch of red and purple pulsing lights. Whatever that thing is, I know it's not good.   
  
  
I've got Herbie in his carrying cage. He scratched me as I was putting him in, but I'm not mad at him. This shit has me spooked too. My plan is to drive until I am out of town and then stay at a hotel somewhere. Hopefully, they allow pets.  
  
  
**11:40 PM:** Where the hell is everyone? I thought they were just holed up, but I just passed a bunch of abandoned cars on the side of the road. Shit, I can see that thing getting closer in my rearview. Did it do this? I don't see any wreckage.  
  
  
It's like they all decided to park their cars, get out and move on foot. Actually, I don't remember seeing any doors open. I wish I knew what's going on. If Jimmy heard my message, I'll have to apologize when I see him again.  
  
  
  
**11:46 PM:**  Oh god, it's almost on me. I've been pushing 80 and yet I can't seem to outrun it. What is this thing? Where did it come from? What does it want?   
  
  
I can go the rest of my life not having any of these questions answered so long as we can get away. Thank Christ these roads don't have many turns. Herbie sounds terrified. It's okay, bud, I am too.  
  
  
**11:50 PM:** Something, no, a bunch of things just passed my car. There are handprints all over my windows now. Are these ghosts? Their prints are really long.  
  
  
"It's here," they keep chanting.  
  
  
  
**11:56 PM:** I'm fucked. Whatever these things are, they've blocked me off. I can't turn back either. I should have listened.  All those messages were trying to warn me.   
  
  
Why couldn't I see what was right in front of me? Why did I have to be so stupid? At least I did one thing right. I set Herbie free. He's strong and he can turn on the charm when he needs to.   
  
  
I know he'll be alright. I'll post this at the hour. Whatever this thing is it will do anything to have me. I can't even begin to imagine why. All I can do now is wait to face my fate.   
  
  
It's clearer now. What's with those tears? It's as if it's ripping open the air around it. Wait, why does my post have all these timestamps? I don't remember typing them. Have I been doing that this whole time?  
  
  
It doesn't matter now anyway. I've never been more terrified in my life, but I know there's no escaping this.
