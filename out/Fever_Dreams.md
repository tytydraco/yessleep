I woke up on the floor next to the couch, my clothes soaked in sweat, the smell of latex balloons oozing off me. I was on my back, staring at the ceiling, waiting. I was certain if I watched for long enough, something would happen to me, like something was watching me through the roof of my living room. I heard something rustling in the kitchen, maybe dishes echoing in the sink. The aroma of my mom's chicken and herbed rice wafted through the air as the rotating fan spun towards the couch. My skin was so hot. I couldn't feel the wind and the smell was making me sick.

I sat up, my vision spinning as I did, twisting the walls back and forth, the fish tank on the stand in front of me looking as if it would dump all over the carpet. I shut my eyes, trying to steady myself, but it only made it worse. I blindly reached for the glass of water I knew was sweating on the coffee table to my right. I missed a few times and willed myself to open my eyes, risking my nausea in exchange for the water I desperately needed.

There was no cup. I slept longer than I thought and somebody must have moved it to the sink. I had come home from school early, sick yet again, and had watched cartoons on the couch for about an hour as my parents went about their day. My shows started at noon, which means I fell asleep around 1 o'clock. It was dark outside now and I heard rain pattering the windows. It hadn't rained in a few days, but growing up in a small mountain town in Oregon, I was used to sporadic rain and shine. I slowly raised my head to look for my mom in the kitchen, the request for some water or juice to help ease what had to be the heaviest thirst I had ever experienced pursing my lips. It felt like cotton filled my cheeks and replaced my tongue.

My mom wasn't there. I could tell I had a fever again. I had grown used to the symptoms and the heat radiating from me was unmistakable. The confusion wasn't as frightening as it was when I'd first started getting them, and being older as I write this, I could almost equate my strange acceptance of my symptoms as the feeling of psychedelics.

I gripped the edge of the coffee table and pushed myself off the ground. The spinning grew stronger and I clenched my teeth, trying to focus on a single grain of the carpet, a strategy I'd found helped to fight the drifting of my vision when closing my eyes didn't work. I forced my shaking legs to hold me up, knowing I would be okay soon, repeating the sentiment in my head to squelch the panic that clawed the bottom of my throat whenever things got to this point. I couldn't go to the hospital again, it was too much stress on my parents.

The shaking eased a bit and the swaying slowed to a steady swish, like I was in my dad's lap, watching TV in the rocking chair. I slowly took my hands off the table and straightened my back, looking to the kitchen. "Mom?" I couldn't hear my own voice. That wasn't uncommon when my ears got this hot. I felt my lips move and my throat vibrate and that was enough for me. Questioning things only made the panic rise.

After a few seconds with no signs of her, I started to walk around the coffee table, headed for the kitchen. After a few wobbly steps, I noticed nothing on the stove. Dinner must be keeping warm in the oven. I stopped walking in front of the hallway that stretched the length of the house. Mine, my brother's and my parents bedroom doors were all closed. The hallway was always so eerily dark, it had been the bane of me since we moved into this house. "Mom?" I felt myself call again, hoping to see the door at the end of the hall open.

I waited a while and blinked only once, but I swore the hallway got darker. My eyes and throat grew hotter as I stood and I could feel the swaying sneaking up on me. I needed to lay back down, but I needed water more. The door stayed closed, and rather than walk down the hall, I opted to get it myself.

I looked back towards the kitchen and started walking the last achingly long 10 steps to the sink. The microwave flashed '3:13'. The power surges often in my town and we never felt it was worth it to reset all the digital clocks when it eventually came back on. 

Just as my foot moved from the soft carpet to the cold tile floor of the kitchen, a dry, throaty gurgle erupted behind me. I couldn't hear myself speak, but the sound seemed to bounce off the walls, radiating through my head like a fire alarm was taped to my ear. I turned slowly, fighting the swirl of the house around me as I tried to find the source of the terrifying noise that pounded my temples. 

I was beside the couch again, standing in the puddle of sweat I'd made in my sleep. I was looking down at the couch. Looking down at me. My eyes wide and bloodshot, mouth hanging open tightly, the edges of my lips cracking and bleeding as I stretched my jaw, fighting to push every bit of air out of my lungs in a hopeless attempt to scream. The raspy, prolonged coughing sound came from deep within me, straight from my lungs.

The panic took over as I stared at myself and eagerly crawled up my throat like bile. I gripped my hair in my hands and felt myself scream. There was no sound.

I woke up screaming, eyes wide and hot. My dad's panicked face floated above me, the light of the afternoon sun glinting off his contacts. He had one hand lightly holding the back of my neck, the back of the other resting against my forehead. My screaming made him jump and back away a step. He quickly collected himself and kneeled beside the couch, wrapping me in a hug as I gathered the air to scream again, gently pressing my chest to his. I could feel his rapid heartbeat and quick breaths.

"Bubby! Hey, everything's okay! You're alright. It was just a dream, you're okay." I was sobbing and babbling about a reflection with no breath and not having a voice. He kept me pressed in a hug, soothing me. His heartbeat grew steady and his words grew softer the longer we lay there. We stayed like that until my tears abated, which happened quickly as my symptoms overtook my emotions.

I felt my hot heartbeat behind my eyes and ears, my head throbbing like a steady drum. I closed my eyes, steaming tears still wetting my cheeks, focusing on the soothing familiarity of the noises of my family. The low volume of the cartoons on the TV, the quick breathing of my dog at my feet, the chicken searing in the pan in the kitchen. My dad stood from the edge of the couch and I could feel his eyes on me. "I don't care if we can't afford it, we're going back to the ER." At some point, my mom must have walked to the edge of the coffee table. "Please." Was all she said. I was asleep before I heard them walk away. 



I had planned on writing out more of these dreams and more stories about this house, but I wasn't expecting to get emotional in the writing of this and thinking of them makes me uncomfortable. Maybe I will write more, but for now, I'm done. I fucking hate thinking about that house.
