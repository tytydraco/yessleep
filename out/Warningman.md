The moon was fading, swallowed by the first rays of sunlight piercing through the cold sky. The city slowly awakened, pulling itself out of mysterious dreams that would eventually be forgotten—lost in time like whispers in the wind.

But in the outskirts, just beyond the town’s edge, seven teenagers stood near Blackwood Forest.

The place wasn’t cursed. It wasn’t abandoned.

It was just… wrong.

The trees stretched endlessly, their twisted branches forming unnatural shapes against the sky. Signs littered the edges of the woods, nailed to trunks, impaled into the ground, hanging by rusted chains. They were old, decayed, covered in moss—but their messages remained clear:
	•	DANGER.
	•	DO NOT ENTER.
	•	STAY OUT.
	•	YOU WON’T BE WARNED AGAIN.

Yet, despite this, the seven teens stood at the entrance, eyes gleaming with the thrill of the unknown.

William and Sam, two brothers, were the first to arrive. Sam was reckless, overconfident, always chasing excitement. William, though younger, was more cautious—yet something about this forest pulled him in.

Soon, their friends arrived.

“Willy! Sammy! We’re here!” Sally called out, running toward them. She was only eleven, her small frame bouncing with excitement. A sweet girl, but… she had an odd love for scary things.

“Yeah, we’re here!” said Niki, grinning. Thirteen years old, the bravest in town—or at least, the most reckless.

“Where’s Eric?” William asked.

Before anyone could answer, a breathless voice shouted from behind.

“Guys!! Wait up!!”

A boy in glasses sprinted toward them, panting. Eric—the scaredy-cat. No one expected him to show up.

“Whoa,” Sam smirked. “Our nerd is actually here?”

“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Eric muttered, adjusting his glasses.

A hand suddenly clamped onto Sam’s shoulder.

“Right here.”

Sam jumped in shock. It was Ari—15 years old, the oldest among them. Serious, responsible, and usually the voice of reason.

Sam huffed. “I-I wasn’t scared!”

The group laughed, but the mood shifted when William spoke.

“Guys…” He turned toward the trees. “Wanna go into Blackwood Forest?”

Silence.

Eric froze, face pale. “We can’t! There are signs everywhere! The police—”

“Oh, come on!” Sam groaned. “Don’t be a baby, Eric.”

Sally hesitated, but nodded.

Ari crossed her arms. “I agree with Eric. This place is off-limits for a reason.”

William’s excitement faded.

Then, Niki was gone.

The group whipped around, searching.

“She probably ran in,” Sam grinned. “She loves danger.”

Ari cursed under her breath. “Fine. But we go in only to find Niki—then we leave.”

William smirked. Perfect.

The Forest

The deeper they went, the stranger it felt.

The air was different—thicker, heavier. The trees were covered in more warning signs. They weren’t new. They were ancient—some scratched as if something had clawed through them.

Eric’s hands trembled. “Guys… please, we should call the police…”

Sam rolled his eyes. “Eric. Shut. Up.”

Then, something grabbed William’s arm.

Sally almost screamed—until they saw Niki’s grinning face.

“Boo.”

Sally shoved her. “NIKI!!! WHAT THE HELL?!”

Ari sighed in relief. “Let’s go back. Now.”

But William didn’t move.

“…No,” he whispered.

Sam grinned. “Yeah! We just got here!”

Eric glared. “I’m not dying for your stupid adventure.”

Then, the trees moved.

Not wind. Not imagination. The shadows between them shifted—something long, tall, and wrong standing too still among the trunks.

A figure.

At first, it looked like just another sign—a yellow smiley face painted on a rusted metal slab.

Then, it turned its head.

A cold, metallic voice—glitching, distorted.

“wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg hErE?”

It was tall. Too tall. Thin, its arms too long, fingers sharp like rusted blades. The smiley face didn’t change, but somehow, it felt angry.

Sam laughed. “The hell is this? Some animatronic?”

The creature stepped closer.

“yOu ArE nOt GoInG dEePeR.”

The smiley face warped—from happy to sad. The air turned colder.

Sam stepped forward. “Or what?”

The thing lunged.

Metal claws gripped Sam’s arm, carving a deep, painful mark into his skin.

Sam screamed.

“ThIs Is YoUr FiRsT wArNiNg.”

The forest fell silent.

Sam clutched his bleeding arm, face twisting in pain.

Ari bowed her head. “We’re… sorry. We won’t come back.”

The creature stood still. Its mask slowly changed—back to a happy face.

“ThAnKs.”

It turned away, hammering more warning signs into the trees.

The Last Warning

That night, Sam’s smirk returned.

“You’re going back,” William whispered.

Sam grinned. “You know me too well. You in?”

William hesitated. But the forest called him.

“…Yeah.”

Midnight.

They returned—bringing a knife, flashlights, food. The trees swayed violently, despite the still air. The signs of danger seemed to scream at them.

Then, they saw him.

Warningman.

His mask wasn’t smiling. It wasn’t sad.

It was a danger sign.

“I told you to stay away,” his voice glitched.

Sam smirked. “Guess what? We don’t care.”

Warningman moved fast.

Faster than any human should.

Metal claws wrapped around Sam’s throat.

Sam gasped, kicking, clawing at its grip.

William lunged—stabbing it with the knife.

Nothing.

No reaction.

No pain.

Only its glitching, empty voice:

“ThIs Is YoUr LaSt WaRnInG.”

William ran.

Through the dark, past the whispers, past the shadows with watching eyes.

Then—nothing.

Silence.

Black.

Morning.

The police found a single sign, painted in Sam’s blood.

It read:

“This is your last warning.”

But Sam?

Sam was never found.

And William never spoke again.
