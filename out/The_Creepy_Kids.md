When I was younger, around 5-6, I lived in a two-story house in the Netherlands. For the most part, it was pretty peaceful and everyone was happy, we lived in a gated neighbourhood so we assumed we had nothing to be scared of. However, one Saturday morning I went down to the kitchen when everyone but my dad was asleep. He was in the kitchen making breakfast and I went down to see if he needed any help. Now, let me explain the layout of the kitchen/door place. Right next to the front door was the kitchen, there was also a window facing out the kitchen sink outside into the frontyard, and in the door there was the mail/paper inserter thing.

As I mentioned before, I went down to help my dad. I went into the kitchen and looked out into the yard when I saw children, they were honestly beautiful. There was 2-3 girls and a boy. They all had blonde hair but their eyes..they had white eyes. Like egg whites but no yolk. I was kind of scared but I didn't think much of it since, after all, they do live in OUR gated community and their house was decorated for Christmas. Anyways, I went out of the kitchen to grab a chair and sit right outside of the kitchen when an orange envelope came through the mail inserter. Over there, it was written in cursive 'Save The Day', which obvi ik it's an invitation but when I opened the envelope, there was 2 peanuts, nothing else. I showed it to my dad and he said DON'T eat it, but me being the curious kid I was ofc, I ate it. Through the day, nothing happened. I fell asleep at 9 pm as usual.

At around 2 am, my sleep broke and I noticed bruises all over my body. Nobody else was awake but I looked into the backyard and saw a pair of eyes, looking straight at me. I tossed and turned and tried to fall asleep, but I kept wondering how I got those bruises. It was almost like black magic.

Next morning I told my mom and she said I probably just ran into stuff, I knew I didn't, but I wasn't in the mood to argue so the day went as normal and in the night, and I went to bed again. In the morning, I woke up with weird scratches. At that point, as a little kid I was concerned but didn't understand what it was, now that i look back, probably black magic. That morning, I went for a bike ride and saw the house was empty. The blinds were closed and the decorations were all gone. I expected them to come back, maybe they were on vacation? But, they never, ever did.

After that, every night I'd go to sleep and wake up with some sort of scars or bruises and eventually, my parents called a hujur, which is basically a priest but in Islam, and he did some blessing with holy water and after that it stopped. I just wonder what those kids were up to and what their intention was.
