I was inside the master bedroom when i heard the garage open and a car go in, i looked at my friend Victor as we realized the couple came home early, we hadn't expected that. 

"Put everything back." Victor whispered to me, we took all the watches, tablets, money and anything we took back exactly as we found them, i heard the couple speaking down stairs but couldn't make out anything. 

After we put everything back Victor told me to follow him, he pulled down the scuttle attic trying to do as little noise as he could, when we got up he closed it and we were inside the attic. 

It had a few small windows that brought in sunlight and the attic was empty except for a few boxes, we stood they're for a minute waiting to see if we would hear them, we didn't really hear anything but we didn't hear them leave either. 

The attic was hot and it didn't help we were wearing warm clothes, gloves and baseball caps, "Let's try to leave." Victor whispered, we got down the attic and tip toed away, Victor opened the door quietly and quickly shut it quietly "The man is here." Victor said. 

I asked "What is he doing?" And Victor said "Hes going into the child's room.", when i first entered the kids room a few minutes before the couple arrived i was shocked, through spying on them for the past week to know their routine i never saw their daughter, at least i assume the child is a daughter based off the decoration of the room.

"Did you see their kid at all?" I asked, Victor shook his head "Maybe she's in a boarding school or     camp or something." Victor made a guess, we heard the man walk downstairs and we heard a female, his wife i assumed "Everything is ready." We heard two pairs off footsteps walk into the basement. 

Me and Victor assumed everything was fine and tip toed downstairs, Victor tried to open the door but it was locked, when we tried to find another exit, we heard a saw down the basement and a violent scream, it sounded like a man was getting cut. 

Me and Victor froze, the screaming didn't stop, the muffled screaming kept going, me and Victor walked to a window to open it, when I tried to open it i couldn't, Victor whispered "Leave it to me." When he tried he couldn't either, we noticed a small iron mechanicsm on the window, a window latch. 

We went from one window to another as the screaming continued, suddenly Victor accidently hit a small table, it lifted a little before crashing down making a large thud, the saw stopped, we froze in place but then we heard two pairs of footsteps coming upstairs, Victor told me to follow him and i did, we got to the kitchen and hid inside the pantry.

We heard the basement door open, the man said "Is someone here? I'll call the police." I didn't know wether or not he'll do it considering what we heard in the basement, suddenly the woman's voice said "Did more of them follow us?" A worry in her voice, the man said "No ones coming, let's check around."

There me and Victor were, hiding again, we didn't plan on hurting anyone, just a few items stolen but now violence might be unavoidable, after a few minutes Victor opened the pantry door, me and him peeked outside and saw the wife, her hands covered in blood and she was washing them, me and Victor got worried, we were in a house with serial killers. 

Suddenly a guy with a tank top and underwear only came into the room, he was covered in blood and missing his hands, when the woman noticed him she screamed, the man completely oblivious asked her for help, she took out a big kitchen knife and started stabbing him repeatedly until died. 

The husband ran into the room, he comforted her and she asked "Howd he escape?" The man said "i don't know, I'll check if the other escaped." As he left, me and Victor knew we had to escape, who knows what theyd do if they caught us. 

Victor took a large can of beans and told me to follow his lead, we went outside the pantry and went next to the woman, when she noticed us she was about to scream when Victor hit her in the head, her skin split open, a few seconds later she was about to scream again when Victor hit her again, and again, and again until she died, blood covering half her face. 

Me and Victor ran to escape not caring about being quiet anymore, when we got to the garage door it was locked "Dammit" said Victor, we ran to the dining room, Victor told me "Break the window." I took a chair and started hitting the window, it broke and i thought it was all over until i heard the man's footsteps running up the basement. 

Victor whispered "I'll get him just stay there." As he hid behind the door, the man came with a machete, he lunged at me but Victor reacted quickly and hit him in the back of his head, he fell on the broken pieces of glass in the window, when he pulled himself up he collapsed almost instantly, he was dead. 

Victor said "Let's go and get the guy downstairs." And I nodded, we ran down in the basement and saw sheeted hospital curtains and hospital beds, on one of them had lots of blood and bulilt in restraints, i guess the main earlier managed to squeeze through, we saw two large dog cages, one was empty while the other had the other man, he had long strained hair and an average body build. 

He had his mouth covered in silver duct tape and his hands were also taped together, he looked at us with fearful pleading eyes, "We're here to rescue you." I said, i noticed the lock on the cage, the man pointed at his pocket and upstairs, Victor ran upstairs and came down with the keys apparently they were in the husbands pocket. 

When we freed him and cut all the ductape with scissors Victor said "If you call the police we were never here alright." The man thought for a moment, he would have to take the blame for two kills but it was self defense right. The man said "I think it's best if i just leave." Me and Victor nodded. 

We went back to the upstairs and the keys could also open the front door, when we left the man thanked us and ran while me and Victor took our car that was a couple blocks away and drove home. 

We turned on the news but we knew it would be a while before anyone found them, suddenly the newsman said "Today marks the one year anniversary of Luna's kidnapping." They show a picture of a young girl, then the newsman said "This is a video from her parents Jason and Mariah." They show the two people, the same people that owned the house we were just in and killed them. 

In the video the two said "Whoever took her if you're seeing this please give us our daughter, she's all we want we'll give you anything." Then the newsman said "Heres pictures of the two suspects" they show the guy we saw the woman kill in the kitchen and the man we just freed, the newsman said "They're both registered sex offenders, if you see them report to the police immediately" Victor nearly threw up. 

"What have we done." I shouted "What the hell have we done."
