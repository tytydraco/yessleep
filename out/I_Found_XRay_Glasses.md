My name is Vert, and recently, I stumbled upon a pair of glasses while walking on the beach. And yes, they were x-ray glasses, believe it or not, but for the life of mine, I wish I had never found them in the first place.

Any bidders? I'll gladly hand them over to anyone brave enough to trade places with me. Come on, don't be shy, these glasses are amazing. They let you see things most people would kill for... or, you know, die from. Heh.

But hey, I found the glasses yesterday evening, just lying there in the sand. They looked like those cheap tourist sunglasses, the kind with the beach's name etched into the frame. At first, I assumed someone had dropped them, but the place was empty by then, and whoever had lost them had probably long forgotten. So, I figured, free game.

I didn't put them on right away. It was dark, and besides, wearing sunglasses at night would've made me look like an idiot. So I stuffed them into my pocket, finished my walk, and headed back to the resort where I was staying.

The next day, I was talking with a local girl named Leah at the beach. She was beautiful no other way to put it. I'd met her a few days prior, and she'd been showing me around the area. We got along well, but before our conversation could go anywhere, her friends pulled her away, laughing as they dragged her off.

That's when the sun hit my eyes.

It was glaring through the windows of a nearby café, making me squint. I noticed other people wearing sunglasses and suddenly remembered the pair I'd found. I had thrown them in my bag, so I figured, why not?

The moment I put them on, my vision shifted.

I expected everything to dim, like with normal sunglasses, but instead, everything stayed crystal clear, too clear. It was as if I wasn't wearing anything at all. I pulled them off and looked around. Normal. Put them back on. Nothing changed.

I must've looked like an idiot, flipping the glasses on and off over and over. I was too distracted to notice someone approaching me.

"The hell are you doing?"

Leah's voice startled me so badly that I dropped the glasses.

I laughed it off, quickly picking them up. "These glasses are weird. I swear, I can see perfectly with them, like, clearer than normal. It's like magic or something."

To prove my point, I slipped them back on.

And then I froze.

Gone was the beautiful girl I had been talking to. In her place was something faceless, just a smooth, empty surface where her features should have been, with hollow holes where her eyes and mouth were supposed to be. My breath caught in my throat.

Then it spoke.

"What are you doing?"

Her voice it was wrong. At first, it still carried the same sweet tone, but then it cracked, morphing into a wet, gargled mess. My stomach twisted. My body moved before my brain could catch up, and I stumbled back, falling onto the sand.

It extended a hand toward me. The skin was pale. Too pale. Too white to be human.

I bolted.

But as I turned, I saw more of them.

They were scattered across the beach, standing eerily still, facing me. The normal tourists and visitors moved around like nothing was wrong, oblivious to the ones in familiar local clothing, just standing there, staring. Their faces were like Leah's, smooth and empty, with hollow holes where their eyes and mouths should have been.

Waiting.

I didn't think I just ran.

One of them moved to block my path, so I shoved it out of the way, my shoulder slamming against something too soft, too yielding, like pushing against wet clay. I didn't stop to look. I just kept running until I reached my hotel.

I slammed the door shut and locked it, my breath ragged. My hands were shaking. I looked down and realized I was still holding the glasses. My stomach turned. I threw them across the room.

I needed to get out of here.

Frantically, I grabbed my suitcase and started packing. I had to leave now. But as I turned, about to grab my phone, I made the mistake of looking out the window.

They were there.

Leah and her friends. Standing outside, looking directly at my room.

A chill crawled down my spine.

As I reached for the doorknob, a knock echoed through the room. Soft. Gentle.

Then the handle rattled.

I held my breath.

After a moment, a voice came through the door. "Hey, it's Leah. Open up."

I couldn't move. My body wouldn't listen.

The knocking stopped. Silence stretched on. Then BANG. A heavy thud against the door.

I grabbed my phone and quickly dialed room service. The line connected, but before I could speak.

A voice crackled through the phone, soft and distorted, but at the same time, it spoke from the other side of the door.

"Open the door."

The phone slipped from my hands.

That was two hours ago. The banging has stopped, but every thirty minutes, someone knocks.

The voices are different now.

I heard Leah first. Then one of her friends. Then, a man I had never spoken to before.

And now… now I hear my mother.

She's been gone for months. I came here in the first place to escape the house, to escape the memories.

But now she's here. Telling me to open the door.

And I know it's only a matter of time before they get in.

I've been staring at my phone for hours now, unsure whether to call anyone after what happened. Looking outside, I don’t see a single soul to shout for, and even if there was, I don’t think I could trust them.

As I sit here, trapped in this nightmare, desperately trying to think of a way out, I hear it.

My own voice. It’s flawless. Too flawless. A perfect mimicry of every inflection, every breath.

"Like what you see?" it says.

Suddenly, laughter. Soft, amused, almost warm, like I just told the best joke in the world. The sound coils around my brain, wrong in a way I can’t explain.

Then I hear it, the scrape of a key sliding into the lock. The doorknob starts to [turn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/)
