The rest of that night, surprisingly, was spent sleeping. Yes, I actually fell asleep and even more surprising was the fact that I didn't have any nightmares either. I woke up the next morning to the sound of the nurse walking into the room. I remember seeing how afraid she looked, the hesitation in her stride as she got closer and closer.

She didn't even look at me while she sat down the meal tray with a carton of milk, a small carton of cheerios, and a banana. I didn't say anything. For one thing, though most of the last night's events were largely a blur, I did still remember small fragments of me, running down the halls, kicking and screaming against two of the guard's holds on me. In other words, I got it, at least a little. That, and it was just too damn early for me anyway to give a damn.

She left the room and everything was silent and still again. The more I woke up, the more the dots connected, once more re-piecing the events of the previous night. This led to me then munching on the banana while plotting how the hell I was going to find out the truth about if I had a brother or not.

I thought of wanting to talk to Dr. Ratha about it, thinking maybe he'd have some sort of psychological answer about it. Then I realized, even if he did, what good would it do? Sure, it'd give me an explanation -- *maybe* \-- but not necessarily a solution. He'd still come back, wouldn't he?

Aside from that, how in the hell *would* he actually know? How exactly would he know whether or not I had a fucking brother OR how I'm the only one that can see him? He'd likely have just as many, if not even more questions about him than I did. At the absolute best, he'd tell me he had no answers and at worst, he'd think I was bullshitting him, spouting some nonsense yet again about my imaginary bully.

So okay, that ruled *that* option out, at least for the time being. The next idea I had was trying to act well behaved so I could get them to grant me conjugal visits from my mother. She was the only one, anyway, that could actually answer the question of the truth about my quote-unquote "Brother" for me, as well as the question of why I wasn't ever told, if it was.

After I was finished with breakfast, I went to the door, about to try and go out to the commons area like usual, when I found two guards standing at the door, apparently blocking off my exit. When I tried pushing past them, I found them pushing me back into the room. "I-I need to--"

"That's a no-can-do, son." one of them said to me.

"What?"

"We're told you aren't allowed out of your room no more without permission and an escort."

"Wha... B-But why?" Neither one was willing to answer me on this one. "Why can't I come out, what'd I do?" I tried pushing past them again, only to have them push me back in the room again. I banged on the door, shouting "What'd I do?! Come on, let me out! I have to see my mom! I have to!"

Obviously, they weren't listening. Through the windowpane on the door to my room, I could see them looking at me, seeing me as nothing but the basket case I was. Eventually, I stopped my little fit and sat back down on my bed. Back to the drawing board.

I had to get on their good side somehow, I knew, but how? The thought occurred to me to use the button to call Dr. Ratha gave me to maybe try talking to him that way, see what *he* could do to help, but then I remembered that he told me that it was for emergencies only. I didn't wanna go crying "wolf" again, not since I was already on restriction as it was, so I decided I would try staying quiet until someone came to me.

*What could it hurt?* *It wasn't like I could do anything right now, anyways, and besides, maybe it won't be so bad in here, since he said he'd leave me alone for a while...*

I laid back down and eventually drifted off to sleep. I'll admit, it felt nice, being able to just *drift* off to sleep like that instead of being essentially traumatized to sleep. I woke up sometime later when I felt myself being shaken awake by the nurse for my afternoon pill and lunch. Accompanying her was Dr. Ratha with a lunch tray of his own. "I thought I'd have lunch with you today, Gregory." he said, smiling just as warmly as he was the night before.

The nurse made sure I took my pill before setting down my tray and quickly scurrying out. Dr. Ratha pulled up the chair from the corner of the room and sat down with his tray across from me. "So, did he come back?" I nodded, picking up my fork and twirling up a forkful of the spaghetti. "And?"

"I asked him his name, but he wouldn't tell me." Dr. Ratha frowned.

"Really?"

"Nope. He told me I already know his name."

"You do?" I shook my head. His eyebrows raised further.

"I don't know his name, sir, but he told me something else, too."

"What's that?"

"He said he was my... my..." I paused for a moment. I honestly still hadn't actually processed the idea that I had a brother, one that no one had ever told me about, one that no one had ever seen or could see. I could feel my breath catch in my throat.

"It's okay, just breathe." I did as I was told and started again.

"He said I was his *brother*." His lips pursed in contemplation.

"Brother, you say?"

"Uh huh."

"But you don't know his name?"

"No."

"Did he say why he doesn't like you?"

"Um..." I thought for a second and replied, "No. At least I don't think so."

"I see." He took a bite of the banana on his tray, staring intently at the table itself like it was somehow going to give him a connection to what I'd just told him. I did the same, taking several gaping mouthfuls of spaghetti. I used to eat a lot when I was anxious or lost in thought, despite looking like a tiny Jack Skellington.

"Here's what we'll do then." he said, setting down his banana and steepling his fingers. "I will do some asking around to see if I can try and find something about this for you, okay bud?" My little eyes grew.

Nodding my head wildly, I said, "Yes sir, thank you!"

"You're very welcome, Gregory." he replied, chuckling. "In the meantime, I want you to try and lay low for me, okay? Don't wanna go getting into anymore trouble, right?"

"Trouble?" I asked, looking at the door.

"Well, I think you know by now that we've had to put ya on restriction for a while, thanks to the little stunt you pulled last night." I shrank down into my shoulders like a turtle. He put his hand on my shoulder.

"Hey, it's okay, buddy, we're gonna get through this, okay? I made you a promise, didn't I?" I looked back up at him and nodded. He patted me on the back and went back to eating. I ended up wolfing down the rest of the spaghetti and went to work masticating the bread roll that came with it. Dr. Ratha chuckled and remarked, "Hungry, huh?"

Without swallowing, I replied, as best I could, "I eat when I'm nervous", though it likely sounded more like "Ah Eah wah am ervoth", or something like that.

He snickered at this and replied, "I see that. Well don't go choking yourself there." I swallowed and he stood up, looking at his watch. "It was nice talking to you, Gregory. I think we've made a little more progress today, don't you?" I shrugged. "Well, like I promised, I'm going to look into what you've told me, see if we can't get some kind of a name, okay?"

"Okay." I replied in a small voice.

"Remember, in the meantime, just--"

"Lay low." I finished.

"Very good." He gave me hearty thumbs up before turning and heading for the door. Just as he grabbed the handle, he stopped and turned back around to me. "One more thing, did he tell you anyone else who'd know who he was?"

I paused mid-bite in my bread roll and thought for a moment. I was about to say no when I remembered his words again: *"Ask that bitch of a mother we have."*

"My mom!" I blurted, actually startling him a bit. "He said my mom would know."

"You sure?" he asked. I nodded. "Okay then, then that's where I can start. Thank you, Gregory." With that, he opened the door and left the room. And with that, I was alone in the room again. This time, though, for the first time, probably, I wasn't afraid. Not for the time, anyway.

*He said he was gonna leave me alone...*

The rest of that afternoon was spent largely in silence. Funny enough, it was honestly a little jarring because of this. No complaints, obviously, but still.

That evening, though, is when things took another sort of turn for the weird. I was having dinner; pizza (Yeah, this place had pizza, and actually yeah, it tasted good), mac and cheese, and a platter of fries, when as I was about to take the last bite, that feeling from before returned, the feeling of being "disconnected from my body". I tried to move, only to find that I couldn't even *feel* any part of my body.

I couldn't hear anything, see anything, or feel anything. I knew I was alive, somewhat, and to some extent was conscious, but I had no perception whatsoever on anything. I remember freaking out, at least in my mind. I don't know what was going on with my body, what *it* was doing. That is, not until later on, when I found myself coming to in the middle of the commons room which now looked like a damn tornado had just blown through it.

All the little tables were overturned, chairs had been thrown around the room, and one or two of the windows had been broken. The worst part of any of this were the ten or so kids that I could barely see, laying on the floor, writhing in agony. My vision was slow to return and so was my hearing.

What wasn't slow to return was my instinct to instantly go into hysterics when I felt hands grab my arms at either side of me. I looked to see the giant, blurry forms of the guards starting to carry me away. I could start to hear indistinct shouting coming from everywhere.

"Whah... What's goin' on?" I asked in a daze. Neither of them answered me, or if they did, it was in their manic shouting that I couldn't make any kind of sense of. They dragged me along roughly, to a point where I was sure they were going to leave a bruise with how tight they were holding me. Just like before, with me being as confused and freaked out as I was, I tried my damnedest to try and resist them, and just like before, it was almost just as laughably pathetic.

They dragged me back into the room and all bit hurled me inside like I was a bag of garbage being tossed in the dumpster. And yeah, I know what you're probably thinking, how in the hell do security officers get away with treating a child like this? The answer, something I found out soon after, is if that kid happens to be an unhinged animal, mauling everything and everyone in sight-- A.K.A. me.

They slammed the door behind me while I just laid there on the floor, wondering just what in the unholy hell had happened. what happened to the commons area? Who or what hurt all the other kids and how/why? More importantly, how in the hell did I get out of the room anyway?

*I didn't do that. Any of it. I didn't hurt anybody. I couldn't have...*

*Could I have?*

I turned my palms up to face me and immediately became horrified. Large splotches of crimson stained both of my palms. My lungs closed themselves off. I couldn't believe it. No, I wouldn't. I couldn't believe that *I* had just done all of that, that *I* had hurt those kids.

*Something had to have happened. That's all there is to it, SOMETHING happened and there was some misunderstanding. I didn't hurt those kids. I couldn't have...*

That repeated in my head quite a few times: "*I couldn't have done this, I couldn't have done this, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS!"* over and over again. It was the truth, though, at least as I saw it. Whatever had happened while I was disconnected from my body, I had no knowledge or involvement in it.

I eventually picked myself off the floor and took my pondering to my bed, where I laid back and tried racking my brain with how the fuck any of this could've happened. How did I get "disconnected"-- *again--* and how did I end up in the middle of *that?*

I thought then of every time before when this happened, when I was "disconnected". I realized two things then: that in every case before, these instances always happened when *He* was around, usually chastising me, as well as the fact that I'd never before been as far gone as I was. Before, it was like I was still there, just without any control over my reflexes or my body. This time, however, I was completely *gone!*

This led me to one conclusion, that however he was making this happen, he was using me, my body, to hurt people around me. Thinking of this almost sent me into a heart attack. The fact that my body could apparently be invaded like that, hijacked essentially, and then be made to do *that* to other kids, it makes me physically sick thinking about it now.

The door opened again a while later with Dr. Ratha and two other people in suits entering my room and beginning to go through my stuff. I got up and approached one of the suited men. "Hey, what're you--"

Dr. Ratha grabbed my shoulder and told me to calm down. I looked up at him. He wore a grim, almost apologetic look on his face that told me without saying a word that he and I weren't going to be talking together anymore. "Wh-What's going on, Dr. Ratha?"

"Gregory..." He began, sighing, "I'm going to tell you truthfully. We do not feel that it is safe for you to be here anymore."

"What do you mean?" I asked, looking again at the men while they pulled out my clothes.

Sighing, he replied, "You're a danger to yourself and the other patients here, Gregory, so we're going to send you somewhere where you can't hurt yourself or anyone else, okay?"

"Y-You mean I won't see you anymore?" He answered with a sullen nod. "But... But I don't wanna go!"

"It's out of my hands, Gregory. There's nothing I can--"

"No!" I shrieked, bolting for the exit. "I won't go! I won't!" Before I would even make it to the door, I had both of the suited men grabbing hold of me and tightly restraining me. "Let me go! Let me go, *please!* You can't do this! You can't!"

I kicked and bucked wildly and, to mine and their shock, this time it actually paid off because it didn't take much for me to actually wrestle myself free and take off out into the halls. I was booking. I had no idea where to or what I'd do when I got there, nor did I give a damn. All I knew was, I had to get the hell outta that building.

I made it all the way to the car lot before I was cornered by two more of the security guards. I had just come down the stairs and there they were, rapidly stomping straight for me. I shot a glance behind me. Two more security guards blocked my path up the stairs I'd come down. I couldn't turn back and I couldn't go forward. This was it.

Then, just as they were about to close the distance on me, it happened again, I blacked out. This time, it was all so abrupt, to a degree that I almost didn't even realize it at first. The entire world around me was shaking, and so it was like one second, I'm about to be caught by a bunch of gorillas in uniforms and the next, the world's dark again and I can't perceive anything anymore. Just imagine that for a second, if you can. Hard, I know, but if you can, then you have an idea of what this moment was like for me.

I was disconnected from my body and from reality as a whole. Couldn't feel anything, couldn't see anything, couldn't hear, nothing. I was a specter, trapped and floating in my own body. What was worse was the fact that I was somehow conscious of this, too. I knew this wasn't some sort of dream, as if it were, I wouldn't have been able to perceive my thoughts like I was.

I apologize, I know this might be a headache to think about, to try and actually visualize. Believe me, I get it (How do you think I felt while it was actually happening?). I apologize also for the fact that, no, it doesn't really get any easier to explain, either. In short, though, at least in this current situation, I knew that he, "my brother", now had complete control over my body and there wasn't a damn thing I could so to keep him from doing whatever the hell it was that he was doing.

So I sat there, trapped *literally* in my own head, thinking of every possible worst outcome of whatever the hell was going on. I wondered just how bad he'd hurt whoever he was intending to hurt. I wondered if he'd actually *kill* whoever was out there. The guards were big and tough, sure, but still. Who's to say he *couldn't* somehow hurt one of them or worse?

Truth be told, though, another part of my mind was divided in half between the thoughts of whether or not I'd actually wake up again, and whether or not I'd actually *want* to. Part of me kind of hoped I'd just slip away, either being erased or maybe "phased out" or something by him while he assumed full-time control over my body, or perhaps being killed by outside forces while under his control. At least then, I wouldn't face who or whatever waited for me on the other side, waiting to do away with me or lock me away for what I'd apparently done.

Perhaps to my chagrin, then, I awoke to find myself somewhere outside, somewhere I couldn't at all recognize. My head felt like it was a brick of lead bearing straight down on my neck. My blurred vision was even slower to compose itself this time. In fact, after about three straight minutes of this, I was almost ready to start panicking, sure that I'd just gone blind. Eventually, though, it all began to clear up. Then I wished I *had* gone blind.

I had stains covering all across my body. All over my shirt and pants, my hands and my face, and even in parts of my hair, I could both see and feel these dark, sticky stains splotched all over. It was pitch dark out, so I couldn't see what color they were, but I wasn't naive. I knew blood stains when I saw them. My heart sped up for two seconds, just long and rapid enough to make me panic, before freezing dead mid-beat.

*What happened?! Where am I? Why am I covered in blood?!*

*Did... Did... Oh God, did I ki--*

I shook my head. *No, No, stop it! You can't panic right now, get ahold of yourself, Greggy...*

I stood up, groaning at the extra strain it was for some reason causing me to pull myself to my feet. my feet shook once I was on my feet again. My body was a brick being held up by two dry spaghetti noodles. *God, why am I so weak?* I wondered. *What'd he do with me while I was gone?*

I began to walk, or rather, stumble, out into the opening in front of me out of the alley I'd woke up in. The street was empty, quiet and still. Two streetlamps splotched a small area on each side with soft, orange glows. I wasn't sure what was more frightening then; being alone on a street in the middle of nowhere in the dead of night, or the feeling I had that I actually *wasn't* alone at all. A distinctive sort of shiver, a chill wind, if you will, pricked itself up my spine.

Without moving my head, my eyes moved to look as far behind me as they could reach. At the farthest edge, *just* at the point where I couldn't look any further in that direction without turning my head, he stood, my "brother". I couldn't make any real features about him, but I could see that he was a little taller than me, wider too, with two white craters in his face boring into me.

"You're welcome." he spat. I opened my mouth to speak (well, rather, to belt out a million questions in less than a minute), but he cut me off with, "For getting you out of there. Getting you back out into the real world, Greggy-boy." I tried to turn my head to face him but as soon as my neck began to twist in his direction, he vanished, reappearing in the farthest corner of my eye again.

He chuckled and said, "You're not gonna say "thank you"? Guess you didn't actually learn any manners from her, either, though that shouldn't surprise me, considering, thanks to her, you don't even know who the fuck I am."

"What do you want from me?" I asked this while my throat was bone dry and my legs shook even harder.

"I want out." He replied. "I want out of here."

"Of where, what're you going on about?"

"Out of you, Greggy. I want to be free, to be my own fucking person instead of being shackled to your worthless ass."

"Okay, well, I don't know how to--"

"Oh don't evenn worry your squishy little head about that. See, there's two ways we could do it; we could either be separated, or you can simply move out of my way and let me take the wheel over your--"

"No!" I shouted, cutting him off. I watched his dark, featureless head snap on its side. My entire body shook now. "I... I won't do that. You can't have my body." He chuckled again at this, echoing all the way to the far, darkest end of the desolate street.

"You know, it's almost adorable that you think you'll actually stop me if I should choose that myself."

"Do whatever you want, but you're not taking my body."

"And what're you gonna do about it, huh, bitch?"

"I... I... I will..." I trailed off. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, blood rushed straight to my head, causing the temperature to skyrocket.

"You'll what? Cry about it? Huh, is that what you're gonna do, you gonna fucking cry about it like the little--"

I cut him off, screaming at the top of my lungs, "FUCK YOU!" For a second, I watched his crater-sized eyes widen. I think I even saw him take a step or two further back away from me. Time stopped again for me.

"Well well..." he began in a baritone voice, completely doing away with his childlike facade. "Looks like little bro went and finally learned to swing what the fuck he's got, huh?"

"Go. Away." I said coldly, gritting my teeth.

"Oh sure, I'll go away. I'll leave you alone until I need you again, but it'll do you a world of good to remember this: one way or the other, I AM going to get myself free, you understand?" For about 30 seconds, the air transformed into a lead weight inside my lungs and I was close to collapsing on the ground, gasping and wheezing. Then, the air pressure returned to normal and when I moved my eyes to look, he was gone again.

I stepped out slowly and stood in the middle of the street, alone, swinging my head in every direction. It felt to me like a scene out of a movie, like where the bad guy says something ominous to the hero before just vanishing into thin air. There was an overwhelming feeling that he or someone else was there, lurking around, stalking me. I couldn't see anything, but still... it was there.

Eventually, I found it in me to move and start walking down the street. It's here, though, that I actually something else sunk in, the fact that I was lost. I looked around again, seeing nothing, no buildings, signs, billboards, nothing, that actually stood out as recognizable. I began running in the direction ahead of me, just hoping and praying it didn't lead me even further from the hospital or from civilization. I ran and ran until eventually my legs gave out and I collapsed smack in the middle of the road.

The entire time, all that was going through my head was, *I gotta find somebody! I gotta find somebody!* When I fell, face first in the asphalt, consciousness quickly faded, with my last thought being his voice, telling me, *"One way or another, I will be free..."* I was afraid, passing out like that. It was already painfully clear to me at that point that yeah, he wasn't exactly lying when he got at me that there wasn't really anything I could to against him to keep him from just taking my body right out from under me.

All the same, though, I did end up waking up to a police officer, of all people, shaking me. "You alright, son?" he asked. I just groaned. I sat up, looking all around again. I was, sure enough, still in the street, still in my same clothes from the hospital, and still covered in stains.

"Wha-Where am I?"

"Out in the middle of the road, it looks like?" he replied half-jokingly.

"What happened?"

"Well, again, pal, I was kinda hoping you could tell me."

"I... I don't... I don't really know." He frowned.

"You don't know how you got here or why?"

"Both."

"Well what's the last thing you remember?" I closed my eyes and began to strain, thinking back to the night previous. Everything in my head was almost a complete blur.

"I... I remember being at the hospital. I remember running down the hallway and then..." I trailed off.

"What?"

"And then I just remember waking up here."

"In the road?" I nodded and pointed at the alleyway. He looked and took another look at me, cocking his eyebrows.

"Yeah, it was nighttime, too."

"And you said you don't know how you got here?" I shook my head. Obviously I wasn't going to tell him what I at least thought I knew. For one thing, yeah, I wasn't about to start us down the rabbit hole of "Oh yeah, see my "Brother" -- who I didn't know I had, who also apparently torments me psychically, -- took control over my body and somehow dragged me along all the way out into an abandoned street in the middle of the night and may or may not have hurt and\\or killed a few people along the way as well, all for shits and giggles, you know how it is."

Secondly, though, I honestly wasn't real sure *I* actually believed that story myself. Honestly, I was still pretty skeptical as to if he even was who the hell he said he was, and therefore, skeptical that he could actually do what he said he was going to do with my body. I didn't have any explanations yet that could counter his claims, granted, but that didn't mean there weren't any, just that I would have to dig a little more to find them. Problem with this, the fact that I was now in police custody, probably as a wanted fugitive (at least, that's where my little mind went), and I'd be going to prison for what I'd done.

"You know where your parents are at?" he asked. I shook my head. "Runaway, huh?"

"Uh... Um y-yeah." He nodded and told me to stay put while he walked off, talking into his radio. He was gone for about a minute and a half before coming back and telling me to get in his car. I looked at him for a second, paralyzed with panic. I knew what this meant, he was arresting me. I'd go to prison, never seeing my mom or dad again, never getting rid of *him*, not without...
