I jolted awake to the sound of glass shattering. Heart pounding, I leapt out of bed and ran into the living room. My front window lay in pieces across the floor, the cold night air drifting in. Dark red smears stained the jagged glass that remained in the frame.

  
Blood.

  
Hands shaking, I quickly shut and locked the window then searched for my phone. As I dialed 911, my eyes scanned the shadows around the room. What the hell had broken my window at 2am and left blood behind? This was no prank.

  
The operator answered and I hurriedly explained what happened. She asked if I felt safe staying or had anywhere else to go. "I...I can't leave. I need to know what's happening here," I managed to stammer out. We stayed on the line until officers arrived 15 agonizing minutes later.

  
Two uniformed cops inspected the window and took samples of the blood. I watched nervously from the couch, blankets wrapped tight around my shoulders. The older officer, Torres, came over holding a small plastic bag.

  
"Is this your necklace?" he asked. I looked closer. A silver chain lay inside, covered in those same dark stains. "N-no," I whispered. "I've never seen that before."

  
Torres and his partner exchanged a look. "You sure you didn't just break the window yourself while sleepwalking or something?" the younger cop asked. I bristled, standing up indignantly.

  
"You think I smashed my own window and left creepy blood evidence behind? I'm telling you, something else did this!" I insisted, voice rising with frustration.

  
The officers just shook their heads patronizingly. "Alright sir, just try to calm down please. We'll file a report but there's not much more we can do without evidence of an intruder."

  
They advised me to stay with family or friends until the window was fixed then left, leaving me alone once again. I sank onto the couch, head in hands. Now even the police didn't believe me. thought about taking their advice and just leaving this damned place for good.

  
But a nagging voice in my mind wouldn't allow it. I had to figure out what was going on here. Something dangerous and deranged was lurking in my new home, and I was now certain it intended me harm. But I had to find real proof before anyone would believe me.

  
The next evening I went to the corner store again, hoping to get more answers. As the cashier rang up my order, I casually showed him a photo of the necklace the police had found. "Hey, you haven't seen anyone around wearing this, have you?"

  
He glanced at the picture and his eyes went wide. "Where...where did you get that?" he asked nervously. I explained about the break-in and pressed him for details.

  
"Look, all I know is that thing belonged to Samuel. He used to live in your building like 15 years back," the cashier said. My heart quickened at that name. The one that had appeared in my mirror.

  
"What happened to him?" I asked. The man fidgeted, reluctance on his face. "I've already said too much," he muttered. "Just let the past be the past, ok? Take my advice and find a new place to live."

  
I left more puzzled than before. This Samuel who had lived in my apartment clearly had some disturbing secrets. Secrets someone or something didn't want uncovered.

  
Over the next few days, I became consumed with researching Samuel and the history of my building. According to old newspaper articles, a brutal murder had taken place there in the late 90s. The killer was never found, but a suspect named Samuel Abrams fled town shortly after. The details gave me chills.

  
I also discovered that a few tenants had died unexpectedly over the years under mysterious circumstances. The most recent was an elderly man who had a heart attack just six months earlier - in the very apartment I was now living in.

  
Could the spirit of Samuel still be here, haunting this place even in death? Was he responsible for the claws in the walls, the bloodstained warnings, all to scare me away? Or protect me from sharing the fate of those other tenants?

  
The scratching noises returned that night, more violent than ever before. I huddled trembling on the couch, Every cell in my body screamed at me to get out of there. But I had to know the truth.

  
In the morning I called a medium, Emma, that I found online. If Samuel was still here, I needed to try and communicate with him. Emma agreed to come to the apartment that evening and help me make contact.

She arrived at 8pm, dressed in flowing purple robes and carrying a leather satchel. As she stepped inside, Emma closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. "Yes...there is a presence here," she proclaimed. "Dark and tormented. He has much still to atone for."

  
We sat across from each other at the small kitchen table, which was draped in velvet cloth and lit by flickering candles. Emma opened her satchel and produced a black scrying mirror.

  
She began chanting in Latin, beckoning all spirits tied to this place to appear and speak. The mirror's surface swirled with misty shadows. An acrid stench like rotten eggs filled the room, making my stomach turn.

  
Then...I saw him. The face of a man peered out from the mirror's dark depths. Sunken eyes and hollow cheeks framed by stringy hair. Emma's chanting grew louder as the spirit's lips moved, struggling to form words.

  
In a crackling whisper, it uttered two words before the connection severed - "Not him."  
Cold dread crept through me. This was not the spirit I had expected. Emma, clearly shaken, confirmed my fears. "Samuel is not the one you should fear. There is something else here with you."

  
Every creak and groan of the old building now carried sinister weight. I realized I had made a terrible mistake communicating through the mirror. Instead of getting answers, I had awakened an unspeakable evil.

  
An evil that had now turned its full attention...to me.

  
That night I hardly slept, listening in tense silence for any sign of the entity's approach. But nothing happened. No unusual sounds or spectral visions emerged to terrorize me.  
In the morning, I decided to go stay at a motel until I figured things out. As I packed, fatigue weighed heavy on my rattled mind. I decided to make coffee to help wake me up. Still bleary-eyed, I filled the pot and flipped the switch.

  
The machine made a loud pop, and thick dark fluid began flowing out instead of coffee. I gasped as the sticky black substance pooled rapidly across the counter, dripping onto the floor. The putrid smell of gasoline overwhelmed me. From the skeletal machine, a gust of flames erupted inches from my face.

  
I shrieked and fell back against the fridge, arms shielding my eyes from the sudden explosion. Heart hammering, I gaped at the flaming mess now consuming my kitchen. Through the smoke, I glimpsed a tall shadowy figure watching me from across the living room. Grinning.

  
Fueled by pure terror, I grabbed my bag and keys and fled the apartment. I didn't stop running until I reached the busy, bustling plaza downtown. Surrounded at last by crowds, I collapsed in an exhausted heap on a bench, gasping for breath.

  
It was clear now this was no ordinary haunting. An ancient thing of boundless rage and cruelty had invaded my home, intent on claiming me as its next victim.

  
But giving up and letting it drive me away for good would only seal my grim fate. If I had any chance at being free of this evil, I knew what I had to do next. Confront it head-on, and force it out of my home for good.

  
Even if it killed me...
