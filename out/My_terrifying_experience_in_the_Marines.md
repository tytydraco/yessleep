I'm writing this because I made a short post in the comment section of a tiktok and a lot of people wanted to hear the full story so here it goes.

My name is Jackson and I was in the Marines. My job in the military was an 1833 (Amphibious Assault Vehicle Operator). Think of a tank that floats and drives in the water. It can carry Marines in the back as we operate ship to shore operations, river crossings, armored support while taking cities, etc.  I was stationed in Hawaii during my enlistment and I was a part of Combat Assault Company (no not combat assault battalion as the battalion sadly disbanded before Combat Assault Company disbanded). 

Out in hawaii we were known for doing a lot more water operations compared to the other bases that also had our vehicles. These operations are sometimes known as splashes and well at my unit we were going to conduct the longest training splash in the Marine Corps. On my vehicle is my Staff Sergeant (SSGT for short), My Corporal (CPL for short) and my buddy that we will call Chris. Our platoon (12 vehicles each containing at least 4 marines) start conducting the splash and everything is great. We do our exercises, getting in different formations, run through emergency situations. We hit the beach of where we are supposed to go and continue with our training.

Towards the end of the day we start staging our vehicles on the beach so that we are all in a column along the length of the beach with the front of our vehicles facing the ocean. My SSGT tells us to eat our  MRE's and start getting ready for night and that after we take account for our weapons and bodies we will set up a firewatch. Now for the ones that don't know a firewatch is when at some point in the night it's your responsibility to be awake while everyone else is asleep and make sure everything is okay such as: no ambushes, no suicides, nobody stealing anything, etc. 

We take accountability and start giving out firewatch and im the unlucky bastard that gets 0100 to 0300 (1 am to 3 am for the ones that don't know military time). I say alright to my Corporal and start getting ready for bed so I can sleep a little bit before my buddy Chris comes and gets me for my turn for firewatch. Now in my job we all sleep in our vehicles since they are spacious and keeps you out of the elements. And unlike typical firewatch in other jobs we take our firewatch in our vehicles as well. You're supposed to climb up inside the turret of our vehicle and scan the surroundings. 

Once I'm settled I quickly doze off because of how exhausted I was. 

I wake up with a sudden jolt. I scan the back of the vehicle and see my buddy Chris leaning over me, a look of worry on his face, beads of sweat on his forehead and a frown creasing over his face. 

"Its your turn for firewatch" he says

Still groggy and with a sore throat I ask,  "you doin alright? you seem a little uneasy."

His expression doesn't change, "I'm just tired and I think my mind is playing tricks on me" he says. I start getting up and putting on my clothes I ask him, "what are ya seeing out there?" Thinking to myself that its  one of our friends getting hazed or something. 

He looks me dead in the eye and says, "I don't know but it's not normal and I'm done talking about it"

Startled by his sudden rudeness I raise my hands up in defeat and start crawling up inside the turret so I can start scanning outside. Once I'm up inside I'm looking through the glass surrounding the turret trying to get a look at anything unusual but I dont find anything (of course). The minutes go by with an agonizing slowness to them undoubtedly because I was tired and ready for bed and almost exactly halfway through my time I see sand kicking up out my peripherals. I start rotating the turret to get a look at whatever is doing that because its looking quite violent and I'm worried its someone in a fight.

That's when I see it. A sleek black figure resembling a human but with no face and not wearing any clothes. Moonlight is bouncing off its thick black skin giving it a sort of shine making it look slippery. As soon as I laid eyes on it the thing stopped digging immediately and it adjusted its body so it's facing me, almost as if it noticed me somehow. I sit there not moving a muscle out of fear that it will sense me and would start charging.

"You see it don't you?" Chris asks

The creature with startling speed scurries up the vehicle beside it and disappears on the other side. 

"Yes" I whisper so quietly that I'm 90% positive that Chris read my lips instead of actually hearing me.

"Do you want me to stay up with you? I can get in the driver station and keep watch with ya" he asks. 

"Please do" I blurt out shakily. 

He climbs up into the driver seat and as soon as he sits down we hear a clang. And then scurried pats that sounds almost identical to a cat running across a hardwood floor. In my gut I knew it. That creature is on our vehicle. I didn't dare turn around to look out the glass behind me, I didn't take my hand off the turret handle either.

I hear the creature climb right on top of the hatch that I was underneath. I sat there for what felt like 10 minutes before I had the thought to move. Sitting there holding my breath I worked up the courage to rotate the turret to see if it would get off. I grip the handle tightly and start rotating counter Clockwise to make myself face the ocean again. The creature didn't move until I stopped. And then slowly I saw it's long arms extend down in front of me, gripping the railing that sat at the end of the vehicle. Fingers long and bent at weird angles almost like they were broken 100 times and healed wrong every time. And with a powerful push the creature flung itself over the railing hitting the sand. 

I watched it as it slowly crept it's way to edge of the beach and then sank away into the ocean and out of sight. 

I didn't see that creature again for the rest of our training and neither did my buddy. Now I don't know if it was my mind playing tricks on me because I was exhausted or if it was real. What I do know is that Chris and I never talked about it again and for the rest of our time in the Marine Corps we always stayed extra alert whenever we had firewatch.
