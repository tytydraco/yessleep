 I need someone's genuine opinion. Something weird happened, and I do not know how to write this. I am writing at my university's library because I no longer have a home. My account is still up, and I will use this as long as possible. I am scared and confused, unable to express my worry to anyone I know, so please listen. Hear me out.

 I remember going to bed Sunday night with my light on. It was a good sleep; I remember that much. But once I woke up Monday morning, I was on the side of the road, about a kilometre outside the city I call home. I was in a daze, almost as if I had been knocked out or hit. I had scrapes and cuts all over my body as I stood up, confused. I had no recollection of how I got there, let alone why I was covered in cuts and bruises. I knew I had to get home, so I began limping back.

&#x200B;

 When I got home, something felt different. The grass was unkempt, and the paint was peeling on the house. At the moment, I really didn't feel the need to acknowledge this considering I felt like shit. I walked up the mini stone path overgrown with weeds, wavering and stumbling as I reached the door, opening it slowly while entering, completely fatigued.

&#x200B;

 I walked in, not minding much as I had felt both hungover and like a bag of trash. I heard dishes being washed while I took my shoes off. Dad was never home, and my sisters were lazy, so I knew it could only be my mom. I tried to be quiet to not let her hear me, but it was already too late.

&#x200B;

 "Hey Hun," I heard her say from the other room, "how was your night?"

&#x200B;

 I was too tired to elaborate or go into detail; hell, I felt I might be asleep.

&#x200B;

 "Mom, I'll just talk to you later. My head's hurting, and I feel like shit. Too much to get into right now."

&#x200B;

 In my attempt to be friendly and not hurt her feelings, I successfully dodged the bullet and was allowed to go to my room.

&#x200B;

 When I entered my room, an odd mildew-like smell lingered. It was intense, but at the moment, I could barely discern my lefts from my rights. I collapsed on my bed, hitting its soft embrace as I began sinking into its warm feel, drifting into a dreamless sleep. 

&#x200B;

 I am trying to remember how long I was out. I barely remember even lying down, but when I got up, my head was more perceptive, and I noticed the odd changes more clearly. The room I was in smelt horrid and old. It was a mess with items and books all over the floor. There were objects that I never remember owning and some that I didn't even recognize, but it was still my room. I found it strange and offputting, so I decided to approach my mom about it, leaving my room to talk to her just to notice her at the end of the hallway.

&#x200B;

 The look in her eyes was something straight out of a horror flick. It was mom, everything about mom, just a shadow covering her that felt insidious. She had an outlandishly wide smile considering there was nothing to smile about. Her eyes were dark, aside from the pinpoint white dot staring at me, void of emotion. She looked empty and soulless, even though I could hear her crackled breathing from across the hall.

&#x200B;

 "Mom?"

&#x200B;

 Her breathing stopped leaving us in an eerie quiet. There was no noise for the few seconds of peace. We kept eye contact as I hesitantly backed away from her and towards the stairs. Suddenly, she lurched forward, walking towards me in a rushed silence as her footstep broke the quiet. Her expression didn't change. The only change was in her arms which were reaching out toward me.

&#x200B;

 I turned and ran. Something was wrong, and I didn't know what to do. I got downstairs faster than an athlete could have, making my way to the dining room. As I reached the doorway, I paused in horror, seeing the rest of my family.

 

 They all stared at me silently with distorted faces and broad smiles. The room was silent aside from the approaching entity. I ran through the room quickly, hearing all the chairs back out simultaneously as more footsteps followed behind me. I ran to the door, bodychecking it open with pure adrenaline propelling me forward. I sprinted out and down the street, hearing the footsteps distancing themselves from me.

&#x200B;

 I didn't live far from the university I was attending. I would walk there every day in a solid ten minutes, so I got there in five, going in to see absolutely no signs of life. The ground was covered in soot, and I could smell sulphur as I made my way to the library, one of my safe havens.

&#x200B;

 I made it there, but I must figure out what to do. I escaped my "family" for now, but I don't understand what is happening. I hope this is some kind of bad dream, one I will wake up from any minute. But my phone is nearly dead, and I need to know I am not alone here. Can anyone see this? Am I heard? Please... Please answer me. Considering the internet is still up, someone has to answer me. Can anyone tell me if this is an isolated problem or if I am alone? I am not where I am supposed to be. Please help me.
