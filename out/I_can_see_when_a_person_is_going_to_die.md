It may sound crazy but when a person dies I can see it, just like a witch can see a person's future I can see a person's death.

This curse or ability (I'll let you decide what it is) must meet one condition, that of having a connection with a person.  Connection can be of any type love, spiritual, hate, sadness.

Oh yeah I forgot to mention I can see a week before a person's death, for example let's take you.  Let's say we are friends and we have a relationship of love, everything is beautiful there is no problem, we talk and eat something at a restaurant or something you want, at the end we will hold each other's arms, and from here things get interesting.
When I make skin contact I'll be able to look at you sitting in your car driving down a busy road and I'll be in the right seat watching, waiting for the inevitable, it's evening and you're tired (I notice this quite obviously  because Santa Enne walks you to your place) at some point you shut down, you think what can happen if you do this for just a few seconds, well at that moment you fall asleep and you no longer control the car, and from here you realize what is happening, you shouldn't  to explain.

You thought I'm a antisocial  guy who lives away from society, but I'm not a very social guy, I'm used to the fact that people die, it's something normal besides, generally only my old relatives or my idiot friends die the  more often (so nothing unusual).

I know what you're thinking "Hey if I were the person writing this I could save my friends!"  , but no you can't do this I tried once with my younger sister.
Ana was 17 years old when she died.
It was a week before Christmas, she and I were sitting in front of the fireplace, we were both drinking hot chocolate, at one point we started playing a game I don't know exactly what it's called, but you have to clap your hands in all positions up, down,  etc.
When our hands joined I could see.  Ana was lying on the floor, she was in a house I knew, but I couldn't remember until I saw the bastard.He was Ana's ex-boyfriend, I don't remember the name of the human garbage, but I know he caused a lot of problems for my sister.  From cheating to hitting her pretty hard, I remember when she was 15 years old and came home with a bruised right eye.

Mom and dad weren't home so I asked her what happened, she told me how she had argued with her boyfriend and hit her.  In the next second I wanted to go to him and show him what it means to beat his sister to death, but luckily for him Ana stopped me, well for two days then I made sure that the bastard left my sister alone.However since I left town it seems they were back together.
As much as I love my sister, I can't help but say that sometimes she makes bad stupid decisions.

As I said, Ana was  on the floor, she was still alive, but unconscious after a few moments of silence, the killer appears.  He was holding a kitchen knife in his left hand, he was approaching Ana step by step, and I was watching what was happening, not knowing what to do, as if I was seeing the death of another person dear to me for the first time.
That man approached my sister, raised the knife and said something, something I didn't hear "you chose this, it's not my fault it's your fault!"  in the next moment he started stabbing her 7 times in the chest, the blood was flowing over Ana's white skin.

In the next moment I was back to the original time from then, with her by my side alive.
He asked me what happened, but I told him that nothing happened.
In the evening I told my parents that I was going to meet some friends, so I asked them for the car key.I lied, I was not anyhere hit a friend, but Ana's murderer. I had a knife and some duct tape with me.
Time passed, and Ana lived for a few more months, she was not killed, she had a car accident, she turned 18 and got her driver's license.

One thing comforted me in my suffering, that thing was the fact that the human jeg that walked with my sister was dead buried in the forest.
