I’ve been a property inspector for almost fifteen years. You learn to ignore strange things when you spend your days walking through rotting houses and half-collapsed basements — raccoons, mold that looks like faces, sometimes even squatters pretending to be ghosts. But there are some houses that feel wrong the moment you cross the threshold. 278 Greenbriar Lane was one of those.

It wasn’t on my usual list. My supervisor, Randy, said it was an old foreclosure finally cleared for inspection after years of legal limbo. “Get in, take pictures, make sure the structure’s safe, and leave the keys in the lockbox,” he told me. The previous owner had disappeared in 2008, he said — no one ever found them.

I remember pulling up that morning, overcast and windless. The air felt thick. The house was a two-story colonial, paint peeling, the windows so filthy they looked black. The grass hadn’t been cut in years, but there was a clear, narrow path through the weeds — as if someone still walked it.

I unlocked the door. The hinges screamed. Inside smelled of rot and wet plaster. Wallpaper peeled like shedding skin, and something about the layout felt subtly wrong, like the dimensions had shifted just enough to bother your subconscious. The floor plan said there should’ve been twelve windows on the first floor. But when I went room to room, I counted thirteen.

I thought I’d miscounted. I went through again — kitchen, living room, dining room, den. Same result. Twelve visible from the outside, thirteen from within. The extra window was in the den — tall, narrow, tucked between two bookshelves. I looked through it and saw… nothing. Not the yard, not trees, not even darkness. Just a sort of deep gray that shimmered like fog lit from behind. My camera wouldn’t focus on it. I took a photo anyway.

The rest of the inspection was straightforward. The second floor was empty except for an overturned chair and a stack of old mail. The basement door was locked, but the key ring had one old iron key that fit. The moment I opened it, that same thick stillness poured up the stairs, like the air below hadn’t been disturbed in decades.

My flashlight flickered. The steps were damp, the walls carved with what looked like finger marks — long, shallow grooves descending into concrete. At the bottom, there was a small utility room with a single light bulb, and beneath it, a mirror nailed to the wall.

Except it wasn’t really a mirror. It reflected the room, but not me. I stood right in front of it and saw the opposite wall, the shelves, the dangling bulb — but no figure holding the flashlight. I thought maybe the glass was double-sided or damaged, but when I moved the light, the reflection moved too, perfectly synced — just without me in it.

That’s when I heard the faint knock. Three taps. Slow. Coming from upstairs.

I called out — “Hello?” No answer. Another three taps. Same rhythm. I turned off the light, thinking maybe it was a branch against a window. But the sound was too deliberate.

When I went back up, the air in the den was colder. The extra window was open now, though I hadn’t touched it. A faint gray draft poured through. My flashlight beam didn’t pass through the opening — it just disappeared into that same depthless haze.

And then something tapped back.

Three slow taps, from the other side of the glass.

I left. I didn’t even lock the door behind me. I drove straight to the office, dropped the keys on Randy’s desk, and said I was done for the day. He laughed. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he said. I told him I’d miscounted windows. He gave me a blank stare. “Greenbriar doesn’t have windows. It was sealed in ‘09 — boards, plywood, the works.”

He pulled up the listing photo on his computer. Sure enough, every window was covered. “You must’ve gone to the wrong house,” he said.

I know what I saw.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My phone buzzed around 2 a.m. — a notification from my cloud storage. “New photo uploaded.” I hadn’t synced anything. When I opened the folder, it was the picture from the den. But now, the window wasn’t empty. A faint outline stood on the other side — long, humanoid, with too many joints. It looked almost human, except for its face, which was just a pale blur with a slit where the mouth should’ve been. The metadata said the file had been modified thirty minutes ago.

I unplugged my phone and threw it across the room.

The next morning, I went back to the house. I told myself I was just going to prove it was boarded up — that I’d made some stupid mistake. But when I got there, the boards were gone. Every window was exposed again. Thirteen of them.

Inside, my footprints were still on the dusty floor. No sign anyone else had entered. The gray window was closed this time, but the glass was fogged from the inside, streaked with finger marks that dragged upward, like something had tried to climb out.

I didn’t go near it. Instead, I went straight for the basement — but the door was gone. Not locked, not stuck. Gone. Just a blank wall where it had been.

That’s when I noticed the hum. Low, throbbing, like a heartbeat beneath the floor. I pressed my ear to the wood and heard breathing. Long, drawn-out breaths, somewhere deep in the foundation. I backed away slowly and left again. This time, I took photos of the exterior — twelve windows visible from every angle.

When I uploaded them that night, my software counted thirteen.

A week later, Randy called. “You didn’t finish the report,” he said. “I’m sending Kevin to finish the inspection. He’s heading there this afternoon.”

I told him not to. I begged him. He just laughed again. “You’re getting jumpy in your old age.”

Kevin didn’t show up to work the next day. Or the day after.

By Friday, his girlfriend had filed a missing person report. The police asked if anyone knew his last location. I didn’t say a word.

It’s been three months. The company shut down Greenbriar after “structural instability.” The listing vanished from every database, but sometimes, when I drive past that part of town, I see the weeds flattened where the path used to be — like someone’s still walking it.

Last night, I got another notification. “New photo uploaded.” The same image again, but clearer this time. The figure was standing closer to the glass. I could see its face now — pale skin stretched too tight, no eyes, and a mouth that ran from ear to ear, the teeth thin as needles. Its fingers were pressed flat against the window, long enough to touch both sides of the frame.

Behind it, through the haze, I could just make out another shape. A reflection of me.

I don’t remember taking any photos last night, but when I checked my phone this morning, there were twelve more. Each one of me, sleeping. Each one taken closer than the last.

The thirteenth picture is of the gray window.

And there’s someone on my side of it now.

I tried everything. I smashed my phone. I burned the SD card. I even drove an hour out of town and threw the pieces into the river. But that night, my laptop turned on by itself. The screen flickered to that same photo folder — empty, except for one file named “open_me.” I couldn’t help it. I clicked.

It was a video, maybe fifteen seconds long. It showed my office. The camera was on my desk, facing the door. At first, nothing. Then the doorknob turned, slow and deliberate, and the same gray light bled in from the hallway. A figure stepped through, moving wrong — like its joints were bending the wrong direction. It stopped in front of the lens and tilted its head. For a split second before the screen went black, I saw its face again, impossibly stretched into a smile.

Then, faintly, it whispered —

“There are thirteen windows everywhere, if you know how to look.”

I quit my job. Moved to a new city. Different state. I told myself it was over. But last week, I started noticing things again. My new apartment — twelve windows. But sometimes, at night, when the lights are off, I see a faint gray shimmer in the corner of my eye. Like a thirteenth one, waiting to be noticed.

And it wants to be noticed.

I covered every mirror. Every reflective surface. But reflections aren’t confined to glass anymore. I see it in puddles, in dark screens, even in the gaps between blinds. Always standing still, always facing me.

I don’t sleep much. Every night, I hear the tapping. Three slow knocks, somewhere in the walls.

Last night was different.

The tapping started again, but louder. Desperate. I pressed my ear to the drywall, and for the first time, I heard a voice beneath the knocks. Hoarse, wet, whispering the same words over and over:

“Let me out. Let me out. Let me out.”

I backed away, and something tapped back from the other side of my apartment window. Thirteen taps this time.
The glass began to fog from the inside.

I called Randy this morning. He answered on the first ring, sounding hollow. “You shouldn’t have gone back,” he said. “You let it count you.”

“What?” I asked.

He laughed weakly. “There’s always thirteen, now. It just needs to replace the missing one.”

Then the line went dead.

It’s 3 a.m. now. My apartment’s silent. My reflection isn’t matching me anymore — I move, it lags. When I blink, it doesn’t. The light from the streetlamp flickers through the curtains, and in the shimmer, I see it.
Standing in the reflection behind me, taller than the ceiling, head bent sideways to fit. Its skin looks thin as paper, twitching with movement underneath, like something’s inside it.

I think it’s the others. The missing ones.

It’s tapping again — not on glass this time, but on my shoulder.

If you ever find a thirteenth window when there’s supposed to be twelve, don’t look through it.

Because it’s not a window.

It’s a door.

And something’s looking back.
