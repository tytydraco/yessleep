I  think the best way to explain my life is twenty years of them I lived  in Southern Mexico. From a young age the environment was rough and  alien. Not only that but a few of the neighbors in the village indulged  in the dark arts, witchcraft, bad jo jo! What ever the case it was  something that enraged the young me. I would stomp and destroy effigies  of magic or altars because I found them disgusting against the beautiful  mountain ranges and couldn't stand their presence contrasted with the  beauty of the Southern Mexican moon.

there  lived a man, my cousin Joaquin, he married a woman who wouldn't eat  food she hadn't prepared and never ate with other people. Her father was  a big influence in her life and they were inseparable. He had a home  pretty much next door to their door, so small in fact the patios met out  from the back door. It was through this door that Joaquin tells us he  witnessed how they both would remove their legs to the light from a  raging fire. He first noticed his wife was not next to him in bed. It  happened with more and more frequency.  This night he woke up and was  present to their transformation. Their legs or if you can call the faint  idea of legs, that can be removed and tucked away and placed where the  imagination can only imagine. He saw them remove what makes humans be  able to have locomotion and in place there were talons like some sort of  carrion.  
He didn't hesitate he said he knew right away that it was the matter of brujeria. Witch Craft.

This  was a common practice; brujeria. I still remember My friend back when  were about nine or ten. He had 5 books. A red one, a black one, a white  one, a green one and an orange one. Hate and Money was the green and  orange. The red magic book he said was the bad magic. I did flip around  the book i won't lie. But it was a morbid curiosity. I found out early  enough this was not something I wanted to do or associate with. But  living in my village or town or whatever you call a pindrop in map. I  still remember how strange it got in some remote place. Some tucked away  spot not observed but only by the knowledgeable and intrepid  local.

I  didn't mind watching over people's crops or property if they were going  somewhere or weren't able to tend to them. I would take a shotgun and  some dogs and some lights. But this particular time I wasn't protecting  and tending my own crops and by crops I mean the one's of my family.  This time I had agreed to watch a neighbor from a different farm in a  different part of the town. I planned to go there after  partying it up  from a dance on that side of town. I followed my plan to the exact  detail. It was a pretty good ways out of the closest path but it was  better than walking back to my actual home which was farther and more  dangerous and outright a worse alternative especially after partying and  dancing. I was young but I had the guts  and inexperience to agree to  watch someone's farm. I never told my neighbor I had been drinking  because it had been so long before I considered my self drunk and  besides what I remember cannot be attributed to alcohol.  
I had  finally finished my trek up to the farm and I was settling down in the  shed. Comfy in the blankets and warmth from the knowledge I had  inspected the property and the perimeter of the farm. I enjoyed farm  work it is a nice way to take care of your home and reap rewards. I  enjoyed making sure poachers wouldn't come in and steal your crops. This  time I had not what every poacher and thieve and general evil supplier  fears....A shotgun!  But the fact I didn't physically possess a shotgun  didn't cause me to refrain from acting like I had one. Besides you don't  need to point a gun at a poacher to dissuade them from looting you. I  did everything and finally retired to a comfy and welcoming patch in the  shed that had been designed for relaxing in.  
It was almost  immediately after laying down that the phenomena began. I know I was  tired but I was not dead tired to imagine what I saw. I did not drift  off into the channel of the dream in the current of the absurd. I was  awake, I was in a new place and unknown place. I was beginning to feel  comfortable when I notice that there was someone or something in the  front door.  
The shed was a small little dwelling for the storing of  tools and nutrient absorbent and producing mulch and other forms of feed  for crops. I noticed someone bouncing back and forth, left and right.  One leg then the next...The person was dressed in an outfit. A dark blue  color that looked wet and reflective against the summer moon. I noticed  the two appendages protruding from the top. I tried not to imagine a  horrible thing. That they were antennae or even worse some eyes. It knew  I was in there but it couldn't get the door open. I only imagined the  antennae and eyes as a worse case sceneario of a horrible monstrosity.  In reality it looked like a man jumping back and forth.  
I was able to  fall asleep eventually due to exhaustion. I never have forgotten how  growing up in Mexico during the 50's was not only strange but scary and  weird.  
I've lived the rest of the life in the U.S. A metropolis of  civilization and not a small village. The Blizzard of 1979 in Chicago  was the first time I thought about writing about my experiences but I  thought I was too young. Now I want to share my experiences
