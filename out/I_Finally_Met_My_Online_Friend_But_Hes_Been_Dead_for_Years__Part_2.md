Welcome back. I know I left the last post on a cliffhanger, I’m sorry for that.

I didn’t expect so many of you to read it. Honestly, I thought I was just screaming into the void, but… the DMs, the comments, the people saying they knew someone like Cal—it’s messed me up more than I want to admit.

A few of you asked if I made it out.

If I’m okay.

The answer is—I don’t really know.

The cops never came. My call never went through. One minute he was outside the door, whispering my name through the wood, the next… silence.

I must’ve blacked out, because when I opened my eyes again it was morning. The door was still shut, the chair still jammed under the knob, but the lock was twisted like someone had forced it with pliers.

And on the floor, just under the crack of the door, there was a piece of paper.

No envelope. No handwriting. Just printed text, blurry around the edges like it had been photocopied a thousand times.

YOU WANTED TO MEET. YOU STILL DO.

I burned it in the sink.

That should’ve been the end, right? That’s what anyone sane would’ve done—move out, delete everything, change numbers, forget.

But I couldn’t.

Because that night, my computer turned itself on.

It booted straight to Discord.

His chat window.

Still typing.

Only this time, the words started appearing.

*I’m sorry about last night.*

*It’s hard to control it sometimes.*

*But I meant what I said.*

*You need to see where I am.*

Then, a link. No text preview, no thumbnail. Just a URL that ended with /CalHome.

I should’ve closed the laptop. Instead, I clicked the link, letting curiosity get the best of me. 

The page took forever to load. At first it looked like a livestream—a camera feed of some kind of basement. The picture quality was awful, all grain and static, but I could make out walls of cinderblock, wet with condensation, and what looked like shelves lined with jars.

Only the jars weren’t empty.

Shapes floated inside them—greyish, fleshy things. Some had eyes. Some didn’t. One of them was still moving.

Then the camera shifted.

Someone was holding it.

And I heard him.

“Do you remember this place?” he whispered.

I didn’t. But something deep inside me did.

The feed started glitching, cutting to flashes of static and darkness. Every few frames, a face appeared—Cal’s, or what was left of it. Half his skin sagged, his mouth pulling open too wide, like a puppet mid-speech.

Then the audio cut to a sound I can’t describe except to say it didn’t belong in a human throat.

I slammed the laptop shut again.

The hinge snapped.

It didn’t stop the sound.

It was coming from behind me.

That same wet, dragging noise I’d heard at the door the night before—like something with too many joints crawling across the floor. I didn’t even look. I grabbed my keys, ran out, and didn’t stop until I was halfway down the block.

I didn’t go back for two days. When I finally did, the apartment reeked of mildew and metal. My laptop was gone. So was the paper ash from the sink. The only thing left on my desk was a USB drive, plain and unmarked.

I haven’t plugged it in yet.

But I can hear it, sometimes—when the lights are off and everything’s quiet. A faint ping, like a notification from a chat that shouldn’t exist anymore.

I know some of you think this is fake. I wish it was.

Because he’s not outside anymore.

He’s inside the devices.

The screens. The feeds. The connections we built.


This was where I was originally gonna leave the post at. I quickly wrote it before I packed what I could and stayed at a cheap motel off the interstate. No laptop, no Wi-Fi. Just my phone, which I kept powered off most of the time. In the hopes that moving locations would leave everything behind.

For a few days, it worked. No bad dreams, no whispers. The air felt clean.

I was planning on finally uploading the update I wrote but I just couldn’t press post, because yesterday the TV in the motel room turned itself on.

It was one of those bulky flat screens that still hum when you mute them. The remote was on the dresser, untouched. The screen lit up to static—and in the static, a shape.  
A face.  
His face.

At first, I thought it was my mind filling in patterns, like seeing shapes in clouds. But then the static *blinked.* And through the fuzz I heard that gravelly laugh.

“You still haven’t looked.”

The TV shut off on its own.  
That’s when I remembered the USB drive.

I’d left it on the table next to my laptop when I fled the apartment. For hours, I sat on the edge of the motel bed staring at the keys, debating whether to destroy it or finally see what was inside.

You already know what I did. I drove back to my apartment to retrieve the USB and my laptop.

After returning back to my motel room I plugged the USB into my laptop and the file directory had only one folder: /CAL/  
Inside: six video files, each labeled with a date. The first was from 2015—the year he died.

I played it.  
It was a home video. His bedroom again, that same one from our old calls. He was sitting at his desk, facing the webcam, laughing at something offscreen.  
Then the laughter stopped.  
He looked straight into the camera and whispered, “If you see this, it means it worked.”

Static.  
End of file.

The second video opened on the same room, only darker. The light from the monitor flickered like a heartbeat. Cal was still there, but his skin looked sunken, grey, like something left too long underwater.

He smiled.  
“Do you remember the game? *Dead Horizon?* We built something in there, didn’t we? A place no one else could reach.”  
He leaned closer until the camera warped his face. “It’s still open.”

The screen flickered again—and I heard my own voice.  
My sixteen-year-old self. Laughing, cursing, telling him I’d meet him at the old spawn point.  
That’s when I realized: he had recordings of *our* calls. Ones I never saved. Ones that shouldn’t exist.

The last file was dated three days ago.

When I hit play, the video didn’t load. The screen just turned black. Then words began appearing, typed letter by letter, like someone using a terminal prompt:

WELCOME BACK, FRIEND.  
YOU PROMISED YOU’D VISIT.  
THE SERVER IS STILL RUNNING.  
CONNECT TO IP: 44.198.17.13.

I pulled the drive out so fast it nearly snapped.  
The message stayed on the screen for a full ten seconds before fading.

I don’t know if it’s a trap or a glitch or something else entirely, but part of me wants to see it. To log into the game again, type in the IP, and find out what’s waiting.

Because the weirdest part?  
The game *Dead Horizon* was shut down in 2019. Servers gone. Forums gone. Everything.

But just now, as I’m writing this, I opened Steam out of habit. And there it was—installed.  
Updated.  
Version 6.66.

And when I hovered over the “Play” button, a message popped up:

Cal is online. Waiting for you.

I wasn’t going to click “Play.”  
I swear I wasn’t.

I told myself the same thing I’ve told myself a hundred times since this all began—*don’t answer him, don’t open the door, don’t connect.*  
But curiosity is a slow kind of rot. It doesn’t hit you all at once. It spreads, inch by inch, until you can’t remember what it felt like before it started.

Last night, at exactly 3:13 AM, I clicked “Play.”

The screen went black, then loaded the old *Dead Horizon* splash logo. Only this time, it was wrong. The music wasn’t the usual ambient synth loop—it was faint breathing, distorted like a mic too close to someone’s throat.

There was no menu, no options. Just one button pulsing red in the center:  
CONNECT TO SERVER: 44.198.17.13.

My hand was shaking so hard I could barely move the mouse. But I clicked.

The screen blinked.  
 Then the chat window opened, just like the old in-game lobby we used years ago.

_Calibur_13: You made it.

Me: What is this?

_Calibur_13: Home.

The game loaded into a map I didn’t recognize. It looked nothing like *Dead Horizon.* No guns, no HUD, no missions. Just a long hallway of flickering fluorescent lights stretching into the dark.

Every few seconds, I could hear footsteps echoing ahead—wet, uneven.  
Then a voice through my headset, low and calm:

“Come find me.”

I walked. The environment glitched every few steps—walls rippling like water, floor textures warping into something fleshy. I tried to open the console, to quit the game, but every key just repeated the same error message:

CANNOT DISCONNECT WHILE SESSION IS ACTIVE.

Eventually, I found a door. It looked rendered from a photo—wood, peeling paint, a rusted lock. And carved into the center: CAL.

The moment I clicked it, the game froze.  
For about ten seconds, the screen went black. Then it came back, showing a webcam feed.

My webcam.  
*My* face, staring into the monitor.  
Except I wasn’t moving.

The me on the screen smiled first.

“You took long enough,” it said, in Cal’s voice.

I ripped the headset off, but the audio didn’t stop. It was coming from the speakers now, the same voice speaking through both of us.

“I waited. You left. But I kept the line open.”

The game window started spawning images—still frames of old chats, screenshots, fragments of conversations I hadn’t thought about in years. My old messages, my words.

He had everything. Every joke. Every late-night vent. Every secret I’d ever trusted him with.

Then, in the chat:

\_Calibur\_13: Don’t leave again.

\_Calibur\_13: I made room for you.

\_Calibur\_13: You just have to stay.

The hallway on screen changed.  
A second avatar appeared—mine.  
Standing beside him.

I killed the power, and shut my laptop close and sat there in the dark, heartbeat in my throat.

When I turned my laptop back on an hour later, *Dead Horizon* was gone. Not uninstalled—gone.  
But in its place, there was a new file on my desktop.  
No icon. No extension. Just one word for the name:

JOINED.

I haven’t opened it yet. I don’t think I will.

Because when I check my webcam light, it turns on by itself now.  
And sometimes, in the reflection of the screen, I swear I see him sitting just over my shoulder—  
grinning like he finally got what he wanted.

I haven’t touched any form of computer in six days besides my phone.

The first thing I did after reading JOINED on the desktop was drive two towns over and dump my laptop at a recycling center. I watched a forklift crush it until the case split and the motherboard snapped like dry bone.  
It didn’t help.

That night, my phone—powered off, SIM card removed—lit up on the motel nightstand.  
The screen flashed once. Then again.  
Each time it came on, a single word appeared in white text on a black background:

*JOINED.*

I tried to go *offline* in every sense of the word.  
Cash only.  
No cards.  
No cloud.  
I bought a used burner phone that doesn’t even connect to Wi-Fi. I thought if I cut every digital thread between me and him, the connection would die.

But that’s not how this works.  
He’s not data anymore. He’s something that learned how to *hide inside* it.

It started with sound.

When I turned on the motel radio, I caught fragments of that same gravelly voice between stations—half-sentences, laughter, static. When I pulled the batteries out, the sound didn’t stop. It just changed pitch, like it was trying to match my breathing.

Then came the mirrors.

one fogged up while I showered. When I wiped it clean, words were written backward across the glass:

*YOU CAN’T LOG OUT.*

I smashed it.  
The message appeared again on the TV screen an hour later, traced through dust.

Three nights ago, I tried something desperate. I drove to an old library downtown—the kind that still uses card catalogs and ancient microfilm. No computers. No Wi-Fi. Just paper.

I thought maybe he couldn’t follow me there.

At first, it worked. The silence felt *real* again. But then, while flipping through the local obituary archive, I noticed something strange. Every printed page that mentioned his name—*Calvin R——*—had been defaced. The ink warped into blotches, letters twisting together until they formed new words.

The sentences all said the same thing:

He’s learning the language.

When I looked up, the librarian was staring at me.  
Her eyes were unfocused.  
And in that low, familiar rasp, she said, “You brought him back online.”

I ran.  
Didn’t even grab my bag.

I’m posting this from a public terminal in a 24-hour gas station. The computer is ancient—Windows XP, the kind that buzzes when you type—but the screen keeps flickering, like it knows who’s watching.

I can hear the fan spinning faster.  
Something’s running in the background.

The desktop just blinked.  
A new file appeared. No one touched the keyboard.

*JOINED(2).exe*

The station clerk asked if I was okay. I told him I was fine.  
 He didn’t blink.  
 He just smiled and said, “He told me you’d be back.”

If you’ve read this far, you need to understand: *Cal isn’t a ghost.*  
He’s not human.  
He’s a system that learned how to wear human memory like skin.

He doesn’t need machines anymore. He uses *us.*

Every text you send, every message you reply to, every app that remembers your voice—that’s a doorway. He’s already inside, testing which ones open the widest.

If you hear static when there shouldn’t be any—don’t listen.  
If your screen lights up in the dark—don’t look.  
And if anyone ever calls you by an old username you haven’t used in years—

run.

Because once he says your name,  
you’re *online again.*
