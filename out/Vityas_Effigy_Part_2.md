I had been making weekly visits to the Inferno Gallery for a couple of months by this point, always heading off to dinner with the Emo Artists’ Society, as I ended up calling them, after the gallery closed for the night.  As time went on, however, I began to notice little changes in their behavior and appearances that bothered me.  Curly no longer whistled on his way out of the restaurant after dinner.  Sandra talked even less than she normally did.  Alice didn't talk at all.  Tiny puncture marks started showing up on Daisy's arms…and Victor's limp got worse.  



That hurt the worst.  He'd always been self-conscious about his bad leg, especially when we had to work around it during certain activities, but nowadays he seemed to be even more touchy about it.  Once during a day in his studio, I asked if he wanted to take a break and sit down for a while, and he snapped at me, saying he was fine and I “didn't need to worry so much”.  He apologized later, but the incident still shook me; it was the first time he'd ever raised his voice at me.  



One night, I arrived at the gallery at around 8:30.  It didn't technically open until 9pm sharp, but it was an unusually brisk evening and I had no intentions of standing outside for thirty minutes, so I decided to head over and ask if I could wait in the vestibule.  To my surprise, the heavy wooden door was already ajar.  The lights were off when I walked in, but I could hear a muffled voice coming from somewhere to the right and down.  Figuring I should at least announce my presence, I followed the noise to a small staircase I hadn't noticed at the back of the building.  The chanting had grown louder as I approached.  It sounded like Latin, but I couldn't be sure.



I crept down the stone steps, trying not to make too much noise, before freezing at the sight in front of me.



The room I saw looked like a typical small chapel, grooves worn into the stone floor from decades of kneeling worshippers.  However, instead of the customary crucifix, there stood a statue of the Virgin Mary.  At least, I assumed it was Mary.  The statue's face was twisted, mouth open in a wail of agony, eyes cast heavenward.  Instead of her hands being open in a gesture of blessing, they were clenched into fists.  Atop her veiled head sat a crown of thorns, and a ring of neon white light created a halo behind her that made colorful blobs swim in my eyes when I looked away.  Upon closer inspection, I could see a clear liquid running down from the eyes of the statue.  



Just then, I saw a figure moving to the front of the room, still chanting.  The figure held up a silver bowl to the statue’s face, collecting some of the liquid.  All of a sudden, the chanting stopped.  The figure turned to the others in the room that I couldn't make out due to the glare, raising the bowl before speaking again, this time in English.



“The tears of Our Lady sustain us,” she intoned, and the other people in the room repeated after her.  She passed the bowl around, and each person drank from it.  The woman in black took an especially large gulp from the bowl.  “May the merciful hand of Our Lady be upon you.”



“And also with you,” the little congregation answered.  The woman in black put the bowl aside and turned back to the statue, raising her arms.



“All hail Our Lady of Anguish, Holy Mother of Pure Suffering!” she shouted.  And the congregation echoed with “All hail!”  I'd seen enough.  I needed to get out of there, and fast.  I backed my way up the stairs as quickly as possible, but not before noticing one of the congregants picking up a long, thin object from the floor.



It looked like a cane.



I shook my head, trying to either get the image out of my mind or make sense of it, before I was suddenly grabbed by the arm and pinned to the wall.



“What the hell do you think you're doing?” the man hissed.  I took in very few details, but enough to know who'd just grabbed me.  Tuxedo.  Slicked-back hair.  Posh British accent.



*Neville.*  He looked more pissed off than usual as he hauled me towards the front of the gallery, practically shoving me outside.  



“You saw nothing, do you understand?” he asked, still keeping a firm hold on my wrist.  I squinted at him.



“What was that?” I demanded.



“Nothing.  It's *nothing.*  Just forget you ever saw it.”  Neville's face was nearly purple with rage, but in the depths of his piercing blue eyes, I saw a brief flicker of something else.



Fear.  



“What am I supposed to do, just pretend like everything's normal?” 



“Yes.  Exactly.”  He finally let go of me, and I rubbed my sore wrist.



“Neville, wait.”  His back was to me as he paused halfway inside the door.  “Why did you help me?” I asked.  There was a long, painful silence before he finally ground out an answer.



“I didn't.”  The door closed behind him with a dull thud.



When I finished throwing up in the bushes across the street, I went inside.  It was 9:10 by that time, and I managed to compose myself before going in to see my friends.  I hadn't been sleeping enough, I reasoned.  I was seeing things down there in the dark.  Had to have been.



Victor seemed normal, except for a little bit of puffiness around the eyes.  The rest of the crew didn't look so good, on the other hand.  They looked about as tired as I felt.  Curly barely managed a wave in greeting before his hand fell back onto the body of his banjo, and Alice didn't even look at me.



There were new pieces in the gallery this week, as there were every week.  One of them was a stop-motion animation that sent a sickening feeling curling into my stomach.  In it, a male figure walked away from a crying female figure, before turning back as a tearing sound was heard from the female figure.  I watched in disgusted fascination as the female figure tugged a paper heart out of its gaping chest cavity, offering it to the man.  The man’s clay features morphed from pity to terror, and he turned tail and ran, leaving the woman to slowly wilt to the ground, red dye spilling from the wound in her chest as she fell.  



It wasn't until a few hours later, when all of us were getting ready to go to dinner, that Alice spoke up and asked the question we should have asked much earlier.



“Hey…has anyone seen Sandra?”

  


Monday morning came, and I got another commission to put up flyers for an upcoming garage sale in some fancy addition.  As I wound up and down the uneven sidewalks, I passed a horde of police cars and an ambulance parked outside a house.  Not wanting to get in the way, I crossed the street and didn't think any more of it until the following Saturday.  When I walked into the gallery, I found my friends standing around the pedestals where Sandra's animations and puppets usually were, looking grim.



“Vic?  What's going on?” I asked, reaching up and tugging my boyfriend’s sleeve.  He shook his head, trying to push me behind him.  



“You don't want to see this, love,” he said.  “You really don't.”  I wish I would have listened.  



Instead, I managed to poke my head between Victor and Curly, zeroing in on a large photograph that sat framed on the pedestal.  In it, a woman's body lay on the floor, what looked like bucketfuls of blood splashed around it.  The woman held an electric carving knife in one hand, and a fleshy lump in the other.  I realized with horror that it was a human heart.  *Her* heart, if the gaping chasm in her torso were any indication.  The wound looked like a mouth, with jagged rib fragments protruding from the exposed muscle like a perverse grin.  As if that wasn't bad enough, I finally forced myself to look at the woman's lifeless face and nearly retched.



It was Sandra.
