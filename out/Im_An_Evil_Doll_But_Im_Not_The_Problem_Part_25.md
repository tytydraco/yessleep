If you’re wondering, what the hell?

There’s blood on my hands, both literally and metaphorically. The crowd around me is stunned, but shock can only go so far. 

I know it’s coming, I don’t know exactly what it’s going to be, but this is a group of strong folks. They won’t take my antics lying down.

It’s Milton, unable to watch me mutilate his friend, he levels a skull crushing kick my way. Sprinting from the crowd. 

Through blurred vision and encroaching dark spots I still see it coming a mile off. My misfiring brain tries in vain to think of an option that doesn’t throw another wrench into it’s gears, but there isn’t one. 

I try to tell myself it’s actually stopping bloodshed. By doing something brutal enough, the crowd will submit. I won’t have to watch Demi start tearing folks apart. 

Is that the truth though? Jesus Christ, saying I’m going to mutilate someone because Jack the ripper needs me to, to save the world? Sounds a lot like Satan talking through my neighbor’s dog, or needing to impress Jody Foster, doesn’t it?

But none of that really matters in the moment. As the kick closes in, it’s a matter of life and death. 

The jagged end of my walking stick buries itself in a place that should have everyone with a Johnson crossing their legs right now. My brain feels hot, tears start to fall as Milton hits the ground. Child-like pained screams eating at the fabric of my sanity like starved moth larva. 

I can’t cry, so I laugh, it’s a tortured sound. As I get to my feet, I retch but disguise it as a creepy lurch. 

The survivalist type takes a step, I wind my leg back like a soccer player. Ready to drive the walking stick further into the wounded man. 

I can’t take this, the tension, the violence. I want so badly to cry. 

But I can’t.

“Milt there has about a 75% chance of survival if one of you know some basic first aid. Won’t be any little Miltons, but whatever, the world has enough jocks, am I right?” I say. I struggle to keep my voice even, I sound like an evil Emo Phillips, “ Anyone fucks around though, I’ll kick that straight into his brain.”

I’m bastardizing everything I know, everything I stand for. From clown college to fighting the good fight. 

The worst part is, it’s working. I’m controlling this crowd, I’m in their heads. Demi watching, enraptured. 

“Now that the cat’s out of the bag all of you need to understand something. 

This little dance, I’m just doing it for fun. Every so often, it’s great to really get your hands in the soil, so to speak. 

I have abilities that’d have you making graven idols if I showed them to you. Next person that wants to test me, it won’t be skewered balls or a missing eye. I’ll fuse the group of you together, rearrange the pieces, and let you wander this place till someone puts you out of your misery.” My inflection is all wrong, but I only see a few people not buying it. 

“Meat!” I scream to Demi, “You grab Kyle. I’m going to take a bit of a DBAA tax.”

My voice is harsh and vile, I’m hitting my stride. I lean into Demi’s lie, and he gladly obliges, looking fearful at me as he starts to bind our target. 

The crowd parts as I walk to the survivalist. 

“Food, weapons, and ammo.” I say.

The man takes off his jacket, and duffel. Then proceeds  to pull all manner of equipment and supplies from his pockets, adding it to the pile. 

I can’t let him give everything up. They’re going to be taking care of two wounded. I’m supposed to seem like a monster, not be one. 

“Are you trying to insult me?” I say, cocking my head and fixing the man with a glare, “I want some souvenirs, I’m not looking for your charity.”

For a moment I feel good about myself. It doesn’t last as he removes a pistol, hunting knife and a handful of protein bars. 

Something about the look he gives me, tells me the man doesn’t quite believe my explanation.

Before we leave, I stop by the scrawny addict. 

“How much fun you have left in the bag?” I say, looking to the man protectively clutching his treasure. 

He pulls out three more bottles of liquor offering them to me. Clearly more than could fit in the small bag.  

“As much as I need.” He says defensively. 

We make an Irish exit before fear turns to rage. The empty feeling backpack slung across my shoulder.


“You need to trust someone, kid.” Eli says. 

My mentor, and one of my only friends. He’s a short old man, in his mid 80’s and tougher than a two dollar steak. 

“I know, but there aren’t many good options. Everyone here is so, strange. Morality is all, fucking, grey.”

“That’s rich, coming from you.” Eli says, shaking his head. 

“That’s the problem. Here, I’ve got nothing. I need someone to tell me when I’m going off the rails. But in this place, there are no rails.” I reply. 

“Michael?” Demi says. 

I’m startled, I shake my head, and sure enough, Eli, is no where to be seen. 

“Just thinking, sorry.” I lie. 

I forgot how insidious hallucinations can be. How much they can camouflage themselves in a place like this. 

 “Your mind can’t handle his domain.” Kyle chides from behind us. 

Demi holds a long impromptu rope tied around the man’s neck. 

“Listen here you docked-tail of a person. 

You’re alive right now because I want to get the information you have without taking you apart doing it. 

Because, yes, this place is a whole lot of no-good for me. 

Keep being obnoxious though, it’d be a lot quicker to just start taking pieces from you.” I reply half-heartedly. 

“You can trust me Michael.” Demi says a few minutes later. 

“Was I talking out loud?” I ask, embarrassed. 

“Mumbling, but keen ears and all.” Demi replies. 

“Back home my whole thing was going after guys like you. 

Life being what it is, I got dragged in a totally different direction, but the fact remains.

You’ve been in my head, you know this.” I say. 

“I can’t go through your mind like a book Michael. If I could, I’d have likely found a suitable lie long ago. 

But as things stand now, maybe the truth would work a bit better?” Demi asks. 

“We’ve got time.” I say non-committedly. 

Demi opens his hand, a small hourglass appears in his palm. The top has sand as black as pitch, and is about 10 percent of the way full. In the bottom is pristine white sand. 

As I watch it for a moment, I notice the sand isn’t moving. 

“I thought you said you didn’t have your magic here?” I say, annoyed. 

“This is something that I had made a part of me. Through great effort and pain, it’s as much my essence as my memories. 

You’ve seen the imbued trash used by Leo and his ilk. You’ve encountered objects of power, but there is more. 

Things so connected to the force of the world they simply are. They cannot be destroyed, they cannot be changed, and they were created by something that sits above all else. 

No one knows what happens when you pass beyond the void, true death is just as much of a mystery to me as you. 

This object, does one thing. It quantifies your actions. Good and evil. It weighs them against each other.” Demi explains. 

“And?” I prod. 

“Knowing something is out there keeping track, well, you could say it made me paranoid. 

My willingness to help isn’t out of some sense of altruism. Far from it. My goal is simple. 

I want to get out of this Karmic debt I’ve built up. After that, I’ll figure out a way to balance what I like to do with my fear of what is after.” Demi replies. 

Is it a lie, is it the truth? I don’t know. But I think that’s less important than what I do understand about what Demi said. 

It’s an admission. Whatever gift wrapping he decided to put over the idea, at it’s core, I believe he believes that hourglass signals his fate. 

I don’t reply. Not directly at least, but Demi picks up on my lack of vitriol as we walk. 


“That one.” Demi says, pointing to a patch of wide leaved, multi colored flora. 

I may not necessarily trust Demi, but I trust his opinion on what we’re planning on doing next. 

We walk Kyle to the edge of the plant life. Demi and I sit, I take out a couple of protein bars, and bottles of water, offering one of each to Kyle. 

He sits, I can see the nervousness in his body language. In the way his eyes are darting around. 

Demi lets go of the leash. Far from relaxing our captive, it makes him sweat. 

“Eat, we’ve been walking for almost a day.” I say in a friendly tone. 

Kyle looks suspicious. I pull a couple of 40’s of beer from the junkie’s backpack. 

“You smoke?” I ask, pulling a pack from the endless bag. 

“Not anymore.” Kyle replies. 

“I’m sure you won’t mind if I do.” I say, lighting a cigarette from a book of matches tucked inside the pack.

I smoke, and eat, fighting off the temptation to drink the beer in front of me. 

“You want to make a deal.” Kyle asserts, eventually. 

Demi laughs. 

“What would you offer, if I was asking for a deal?” I say.

“Your lives. I will make sure He knows you atoned for your mistakes.” Kyle replies, his tone confident. 

I cup my hands around my mouth, screaming at the ground, “ Hey dickhead, I’m right here and as of now, we have no idea how to stop you. 

Order’s up, pickled clown with a side of English-style serial killer.”

Seconds of silence. 

“Doesn’t seem ‘He’ is listening.” Demi states, mockingly. 

“If I were to take a guess, your conversations are of a more one-sided variety. 

So here’s the situation. Not only do I not want to torture you, I don’t think it’s going to be that effective. Am I right?” I question. 

Kyle grins, fresh wounds cracking and oozing blood, “Nothing you could do would sway me from my calling.”.

“Damn, thought so.” I say facetiously, “Don’t worry though I’ve been thinking of a solution to that. 

Demi, what’s fear?”

“It’s a human reaction to the unknown.” Demi says without missing a beat. 

“A lot of people confuse fear with horror. Horror is what happens when you see something bad in front of you and you want to get away from it. 

I have a feeling you don’t get effected too much by horror. You didn’t blink back there when I was popping both types of balls in the human body. 

Makes sense, you have to know, sooner or later Big Daddy Sand is going to be snacking on you. 

The plant life next to us is just full critters. No idea what they are, or what they can do, but Demi says they’re not friendly.” I threaten. 

I see the wheels turning in Kyle’s brain.   

“I’d walk into oblivion for He.” Is the brainwashed athlete’s reply. 

“I’m sure you would, you’re big, you’re fast, you probably think you’d have a chance in there. 

That’s hope. And it’s a powerful drug, Kyle. Gives a whole lot of Dutch courage. 

Call me Narcan.” I spit. 

You pick up a lot of party tricks trying to find your niche in clowning. Never know what might impress the right crowd. 

Which is my roundabout way of saying there are 3 options for breaking a beer bottle over someone’s head. 

The first, and safest is to bring a candy glass bottle. 

The second requires a lot of practice, is likely to cause some minor cuts, and should only be done on yourself. Really, it should never be done because it’s stupid, but we’re comparing it to…

The third, which is simply smashing one over someone’s head and letting nature take it’s course. 

 Seeing as I haven’t seen any candy glass, option one is off the table. I give myself a dose of option two, and leave option three for Kyle. 

He screams, more from shock than pain as he tries to scramble away. I have a beer-soaked hand wrapped around his throat as I pin him to the ground. 

Already I can hear wildlife within moving to the edges of the island of plant life. 

“You’re not going in alone. 

I’m coming in with you. You might be able to outsmart or outrun whatever’s in there, but all I’ve got to do is slow you down just enough so they catch up.” I rant. 

“You’d be killed alongside me.” Kyle says smugly. 

“And? I’ve got us beer battered and smelling like some rare steaks. I’d have thought me making death a group project would have been obvious.” is my reply. 

Kyle stays silent, calling my bluff. 

Unfortunately for him, I’m not bluffing. 

My head begins to pound, whispers at the edge of my hearing. I have to get my shit together. 

I snap back to reality, screaming. I shake my head, grabbing Kyle by the wrist. 

He’s bigger, he’s stronger, but he’s shocked, and scared. 

Almost as much as I am. 

None of the storm in my brain is helping. There is no dulling of the horror, no enjoying the bloodshed. Every noise, every sight gains an aura of death and evil beyond what it should. 

“If I don’t come back, just remember, Demi, you’re a murderous piece of shit, regardless of what god’s wristwatch says.” I say, dragging Kyle into the foliage. 

Decay, mold, and salt. The forest shimmers with unnatural colors in the sudden darkness. 

“Shit’s getting spooky now, isn’t it?” I whisper venomously. 

Kyle tries to get out of my grip. He freezes as he feels the barrel of my newly acquired pistol against his thigh. 

“Whatever is coming for us, I can guarantee you won’t want to face it with a missing kneecap.” I whisper, looking around the alien landscape. 

“Hello?” a voice, deep within the forest says. Something about it is, off, almost robotic. 

“Hello?”, another deeper voice. 

“Help!”, we hear from a different direction, small and childlike. 

My heart pounds hard enough to make me nauseous. Fear induced sweat pours from me. 

I’m betting my life on this guy cracking under the pressure. On the resolve of a zealot. But if Demi is right, my life won’t mean a damn thing if I can’t save my friends. 

My eyes adjust and I can see the macabre scene. Horror never meant to be witnessed by the eyes of man. 

In fungal growths bodies are fused with the thick, green trunked plants. Patches of skin and muscle removed, at first I think they’re nothing more than corpses. But as I watch in horror, I see twitches, shallow, pained breaths. 

While most of the wounds seem random, each has had their neck flensed open. Veins intact, vocal chords exposed. 

It doesn’t take me long to see the cause of this unfortunate fate. But my strained mind can’t really comprehend it. 

If I were to try and describe every deranged detail of these things, we’d be here all night. And even then, I’d never do them justice. 

The entities are segmented but asymmetrical, slowly moving plated creatures somewhere on the Venn diagram of tortoise and insect. 

One crawls up a body, spindly, curved legs moving just as quickly vertically as horizontally. 

A purple and yellow colored chitin plate falls backward, revealing a featureless black orb, with a thin, pointed proboscis. Hair-fine strands snake from beneath the armor plates and begin to prod at the poor soul’s vocal cords. 

With a wet, cracking noise the creature jams it’s proboscis into it’s victim’s lung. 

“Hello?” The half-corpse says. 

A migraine almost literally from hell starts to take root. My eyes throb, I lose focus. 

For a second I see them, every life I’ve I’ve taken, or ruined. Eyes burning with hatred, they scream questions I can never answer. 

I bite the inside of my cheek hard enough I feel a dull crunch. Blood fills my mouth, pain brings me back to reality. 

I spit the mouthful of blood in the direction of what I’ve dubbed ‘Bagpipers’, and whistle a sharp, shrill tone. 

“Orders up boys, come and fucking get it!” I scream. 

A half dozen of the hundred pound creatures begin to scuttle their way toward us. The leaves above us begin to shift and rattle. 

The pathetic but resolute look on Kyles face hits me. The invasive thought of how he’s just some putz roped into shit well beyond him starts to nag at my conscience. 

Something hits my shoulder, I look down to see a tiny version of the bagpiper, one of the young, I’m guessing. 

The noise in the leaves. 

I watch as it extends those tiny fibers, almost whip-like. A quarter sized piece of cloth, skin and flesh disappears. The pain hits a full second afterward, as awful as it is, I play it up further. I scream like I’ve been castrated. 

But I notice something odd, the thumb sized creature recoils, dropping it’s gram of flesh. I can’t describe it’s reaction better than saying it was like a cat eating a lemon. 

More begin to fall, Kyle is struggling to avoid the lethal rain. 

I let go of his wrist, grabbing the young Bagpiper, and throwing it at the man. 

As it hits him, blood spurts, the greedy, evil little thing begins burrowing just under his skin. 

“Interesting.” I say, wondering why they don’t seem to have a taste for clown. 

Kyle falls, the creature has crawled three long inches under his skin. I see the fight drain out of his eyes. 

“I’ll tell you anything, He will forgive me. Just let me get out of here!” Kyle pleads. 

I drop to one knee crushing a Bagpiper. 

“No, no, no, no. 

I’m not getting out of here and having you stonewall me once your dick is out of the fire. 

Give me something I can use, then we can talk.” I draw the stolen knife as I talk, “Better hurry, sounds like mom and dad are coming to see what all the fuss is about.”

Kyle screams, then stammers, finally gritting his teeth and forcing out a sentence. 

“He seeks warmth. Everything he does is in search for it.” Kyle says, one incisor chipping. 

I skewer the Bagpiper under his leg, tearing it out the way it came. 

“Tick-tock Kyle, that was a good start, but I need more than that.” I whisper. 

I can’t tell If I’ve soaked through my clothes with sweat or pissed myself. Either way, I can nearly feel the reek coming off of me. 

“The lost, they placate him with crumbs. Cast offs from the wretched wanders. If you watch them you will find, He.” Kyle says, struggling to his feet. 

I keep the pistol leveled at him, making a show of weighing the value of his information. The massive bagpipers break through a bush, all around us the island of flora echoes with cries of “Hello?” and “Help!”.

Kyle tears another young bagpiper from his arm screaming with the effort. 

“Okay, you big baby, let’s go.” I say, trying to disguise my fear driven tremor as being eager to shoot. 

The second his back is turned I’m running. Putting as much distance between me and the Bagpipers as possible. 

 Demi looks both shocked and relieved as we scramble out of the treeline. The Bagpipers stop dead where the wet soil turns to gravel, the forest still ringing with the cries of their victims. 

I lose a few seconds of time, I’m sitting beside Demi, looking at Kyle from across a dimming fire. 

“We have to kill him. You know he’s just going to come after us if we don’t.” Demi says. 

“I did what you wanted!” Kyle retorts. 

Every word is like an icepick in my head. 

I say nothing, getting up and grabbing my seltzer bottle. 

I give Demi a smirk before I turn to Kyle. 

God I want a drink. As I try to walk calmly, to drive down the tremors and misfiring nerves, I imagine how good that first shot would feel going down. 

“We made a…” Kyle begins, I spray him in the face. 

“Do not open your eyes.” I say cryptically, hoping he takes the bait. 

He doesn’t. 

“That’s the third smart thing I’ve seen you do. 

That tingling, it’s because this is a bottle of Sodium Acrylate. Super glue, to dumb it down a few notches. 

Made to fix cuts in Vietnam, yadda, yadda, yadda. 

If you stay here, wait till things get hot, let it dry, you’ll be able to peel it off. It’s going to take some skin, but you’re a tough guy, right?

Now, if you’re stupid enough to open your eyes, well, then things get interesting. You’ll rip half of them out before you go into shock.” I lie. 

I’m not a religious guy, but I find myself praying to anything that feels like listening to make this guy believe me. If my brain was an engine, it’d be spewing black smoke by now. 

Whether divine intervention or self preservation, Kyle believes my horseshit. By the time he works up the balls to check his face, we’re long gone. 



“So now all we have to do is try to find something cold in a desert.” Demi says as we follow a group of the lost. Their ramshackle vehicles moving at a turtle’s pace. 

“That’s the part I’m not worried about.” I say, reaching into the backpack and pulling out a bottle of computer duster. 

I turn it upside down, and a jet of freezing liquid dissipates against the hot gravel.  

 “You think it’ll be enough?” I ask, unsure. 

“It will, or it won’t. It’s what we have.

Our goal is as much about the journey, the defiance, the battle of wills, as anything. 

That being said, the will of whatever is below us, I can’t see it being a small thing.” Demi answers. 

“So what’s the plan?” I say, as the lost start to unload trunkfulls of junk into a massive pile. 

“One of us will need to go down there. As limber as you may be, the pit was dozens of feet, at least. So it will have to be me. 

I think I can manipulate that backpack enough to make a good show of things. It’s workings seem simple enough. 

You, do what you do best. Distract the thing. Confuse it if you can.” Demi explains. 

I hate the perspective it gives me. I’m a throwaway piece in this game.

With their cargo unloaded the lost push their vehicles to the limit, getting as far away from what happens next as possible. 

It’s a Grasping. Sets of long, clawed fingers work their way from the gravel. A widening pit appearing next to the pile of debris. 

Their body language is greedy and perturbed, scraping the random objects into the widening maw.

“Do keep up.” Demi says, sprinting toward the thing below the sand. 

I wish that was the zinger that started our plan working flawlessly, but it wasn’t. 

“The bag!” Demi yells twenty feet into our sprint to death. 

I grab the enchanted ( cursed?) thing, but as I wind back for the throw, something gives in my back. 

Unlike film, getting the shit kicked out of you while dehydrated and experiencing acute mental trauma doesn’t make you invincible. My body, much like my mind betrays me. 

He’s far ahead of me by the time he looks back. That moment of lost focus is all it took though. 

It knows we’re here. 

Demi barely avoids a massive claw, more come his way, and he scrambles to avoid the impending doom. 

I see him, about to dive into the pit, then the unexpected happens. 

Tons upon tons of flesh, junk and plant life vomits from the ground. It’s a singular, forming mass, like a building sized organ suddenly prolapsing. 

Crude, rough features begin to take shape, a child’s cutout of a face tops a necrotic amalgam of flesh and stolen possessions.

The clawed fingers ring the body by the dozen. Demi, shocked at the thing is dealt a glancing blow, it sends him skittering across the gravel like a toy. 

I can stand, I can move, but I’m sure as hell not doing anything quickly. 

I start to laugh, or maybe cry. At the moment I don’t really know the difference. I see the futility of everything in the behemoth in front of me. 

   But I keep putting one foot in front of the other, there’s no taking back the decisions I’ve made.

The creature is focussed on Demi, I get in range, and throw a can of duster toward the creature. A shot from the pistol bursts it against the thing’s misbegotten flesh. 

For a second, I see a hole, but before I can even judge the size it’s filled in with more unholy mass. 

Might as well have spat on the thing. 

Despite his speed, despite his strength, Demi doesn’t have long. 

So, this is where I die then. 

I chase a quarter bottle of vodka with a long haul from the computer duster. When you have 5 minutes to live, no sense in going for your one year chip. 

The toxins dull my hearing, the booze makes things feel far away. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker. 

I stand in front of a flesh wall enforced with all manner of materials. I snap the tops off of two cans of duster, aiming the freezing jets ahead of me. 

It cuts through the thing like boiling water through sugar, but the damage is superficial at best. 

I need to get deeper. 

I wade into the thing as Demi fights for his life. 

Pressure, crushing, from all sides. Flesh and debris press in as fast as the CO2 can destroy it. I press forward, as much of the freezing liquid spraying on me as the flesh around me. 

The cracks in my mind turn to fissures, every step forward a test of endurance and pain tolerance. 

It’s a blur, I feel my hair torn from my skull, a finger breaks, my leg is twisted at an ungodly angle, but I keep moving forward. 

The flesh around me begins to change from a sickening yellow to a deep crimson. 

I feel it, more than hear it. 

He, screams. 

I grip the backpack with bloody fingers, spraying CO2 like holy water through the thinning muscle of this abomination. 

I lose the tip of my nose and part of my chin to the freezing liquid, but eventually tear through to somewhere cavernous. 

All around me twisted mixes of organs and machine pump and churn. It’s hot as hell. 

In the centre of it all stands a figure, naked, sexless, but almost human. 

I lurch forward, one leg locked, prodding torn lips with a split tongue. 

“If you kill me, this place will become overran. I am it’s heart, I am the conundrum, the starving, the bloated. 

I am the only person that never was.

This place will become nothing more than an abattoir of souls.” It says. 

It doesn’t walk, the fleshy ground below it simply glides it forward. 

“You’re not lying, are you?” I say as I stand face to face with the lithe thing. 

“Every accidental wanderer, every person destined to nothing more than a few hours of horror, they will die. From now until eternity.” He replies. 

The smile I give it, puts a look of shock on it’s warped face. 

“Oh no, that’ll probably drive me moderately more, insane.” I taunt, “The thing is, no one else will ever know. I’ll take that secret to my fucking grave. Which I’ll probably be tucked into in about five minutes here.

I get it now, that’s why I’m here.”

Long, bone shafted, steel tipped barbs start to extend from the walls. 

“I can let you escape, your friend too.” He offers. 

My answer is to reach into the bag. This time though, I turn it inside out. 

I feel like I’ve been hit by a train, in an instant the world around me is a hailstorm of cans. Sounds of rupture like ricochets start to chain together as the thousands upon thousands of cans collide. 

A scream that shakes my soul, pain, hot blood, searing cold. It’s a storm and an earthquake all at once. 

A sharp blow, the world goes black, this is the end. 


“Michael!” I hear, muffled. Arms like steel dragging me from rotting flesh and rusted steel. 

I see the alien sky above me, and through all the mental fog I find I’m happy to still be alive. 

Expect to hear from Punch next week, I don’t know how much sense I’m going to be making in the near future. 

Thanks for listening. 

Mike
