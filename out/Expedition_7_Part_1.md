My name is Capson. My crew and I are trapped. I'm posting on this site for one reason only: it's the only thing working in this godforsaken facility.

I am an ex-Marine turned explorer. I've been on yearly expeditions ever since I was wounded in battle. The exact number is six. I've been on six expeditions here in Antarctica. Now the seventh. The last four I've had the same crew with me but this time a new guy was added last minute. A rookie. We called him Junior. Before Junior, there were only five of us and now there are six. Sandra, Mikey, Lawrence, Tony, Junior, and me Capson. My crew just calls me Cap, and not just because I'm the leader.

This all started at the briefing at 0700 hours or 7 am. I remember giving a briefing to the group 5 miles from where we were supposed to go at that time. I informed my crew of the destination, an abandoned soviet facility called Leningradskaya. I said all the routine stuff but added a bit of detail here and there. It keeps the "talk" fresh and makes the others pay attention. After the debriefing, the wind started to pick up. Not small winds, it was storm winds. There was a storm coming.

I shouted to Mikey and called him to ask about the sudden change in wind speed, he was our weather guy. He was the best damn weather guy a captain like me could ask for. Mikey came up to me, but he looked perplexed...confused. Scratching his head whilst looking at the sky.

Mikey: I... don't get it, Cap'.

Cap: Get what?

Mikey: The storm...

Mikey veered off his sentence before he picked it back up again with even more confusion.

Mikey: If a storm is coming over here then why?

Cap: Why what?

Mikey:  Why is it moving towards here? Why isn't it moving with the wind? Especially this strong of wind?

He was on to something. Even I knew this was strange. Especially since the forecast said no storms. Now I know that can change very fast but in an instant and against these strong winds?

Cap: Maybe you miscalculated?

Mike: No, I never do, especially on expeditions. I'm very careful about predicting the weather and I'm telling you there is not supposed to be a storm there.

 I turned my back to the storm and gathered the crew together.

Cap: So, I was informed that a storm was incoming. Don't panic. We have the necessary gear to "weather" the storm.

That joke was said with the intention for them to laugh but none of them did.

Cap: Anyways, we are supposed to head North and take a trail onward to the abandoned facility. However, that is the direction the storm is coming from. Now, that is the only path to the facility, so I wanted to get a show of hands and vote on whether we should head on or turn around and go home.  Alright, raise your hand if you want to continue. Show your hands, show em'. I want everyone to raise their hands.

Everyone raised their hand. Everyone except Junior.

Cap: Junior, is there a reason why you don't want to go?

Junior: Um...Cap, if there is an unexpected storm coming then shouldn't we wait until it blows over?

Cap: It's not a bad idea, Junior. However, I am the captain, and I say we move out. Don't worry, Junior. It's my job to keep you all safe. If I didn't think we would be fine, we wouldn't go. 

I wish I told them the truth. The truth is that I wasn't going ahead because I thought it was safe, that was one of the reasons, but mostly it was because of a rival expedition group. Darin. Darin is the other leader of another group going to the same place. I was worried they were already on their way to the facility just a few hours ahead of us. So, I wanted to keep up with their pace and hoped to catch up with them. Darin isn't just an expedition rival but we have had bad confrontations in the past. 

We all loaded up the snowmobile. It was a giant snowmobile that dragged a giant cage where we all sat with each of our equipment stuffed in the back. We all put on our storm gear (A thermal jacket, mask, and gloves with snow boots) and climbed onto the snowmobile. Lawrence headed up front after putting on his gear and turned over the snowmobile engine. Everyone stared at me one final time to see if we would turn back now, I'm not going back.

Cap: Alright, Lawrence let's get moving!

Lawrence: Aye aye captain!

Lawrence climbed onto the snowmobile and we started moving along. We had five miles to go. At first, we all just sat there in silence, it lasted a good ten minutes until Mikey spoke up.

Mikey: Hey, Cap?

Cap; What is it, Mikey?

Before he spoke up he was staring at his weather charts trying to figure out the exact motion of the storm. He found it.

Mikey: Um...well Cap, this doesn't make any sense. The trajectory of the storm is moving in the complete opposite direction of how storms typically move. I can't explain it. 

Cap: Are you telling me that we're heading inside a storm that isn't even supposed to be there in the first place?

Mikey gave me a somber look before only nodding, I got up to yell for Lawrence to stop the snowmobile so we could gauge the storm more correctly. I wasn't going to lead my crew into something dangerous like this. I started to yell.

Cap: LAWR-

Before I could get the sound to finish its escape from my throat the cold storm air hit me like a ton of bricks. I fell backward onto the floor. I hit my ass on the cool metal which hurt like hell. Everyone else was holding on to their seats not trying to be blown away like I was for a split second. I crawled over to my seat to grab on and hope for the best. I made it just in time as the wind got increasingly stronger. It was impossible. How can a storm hit so hard and so fast like this? 

Mikey: Cap! Cap! Are you alright?!

I could barely hear Mikey over this wind. 

Cap: Yeah! I'm fine! Keep your head down! ALL OF YOU!

I struggled to hold on for dear life, if I got blown away I would lose all my equipment, my crew, and my life. I wouldn't survive a day out here alone with nothing. I held on for twenty more seconds which felt like twenty hours at that moment. I was gonna slip, I was gonna be blown away from my crew, I was gonna die. Fortunately, as my grip was slipping the wind let up. The snowmobile stopped just as quickly as the storm winds left. We all took a breath. 

Lawrence: Everyone okay?

Lawrence was already in the back checking on us. He was a beast. He took all that wind to the face, all that snow covering him, and still managed to quickly move around. His whole body was covered in white ice that would've shined if the sun was out. He looked out of breath a bit.

Cap: We're all fine Lawrence. Tony, how far out are we?

I tried to cover the fear in my voice. 

Tony: We're two hundred yards away Cap. 

Cap: Ok. Lawrence, how's the snowmobile?

Lawrence shook his head.

Lawrence: No good, the engine died on me. 

I could tell something was bothering Lawrence. He kept shifting his eyes.

Cap: What's bothering you, Lawrence?

Lawrence: It's strange. When we stopped and I was coming around to check on everyone...I saw something.

He stepped aside and pointed to the right side of the cage. How come we didn't notice it at all? There were four abandoned snowmobiles covered in snow. I took the chance of getting out of the cage in the back and approached it first. I leaned in closer and saw something partially covered in snow. Each had a different logo on them. Three I didn't recognize but one I did. It was the closest one to ours and it had Darin's crew logo. But that wasn't the weirdest part. No, the weirdest part was that all of them stopped side by side with ours in the exact place. Like we all raced and it was a tie. 

Cap: What the hell?

I knew something was up. I walked back to my crew and disclosed what I saw. They couldn't believe it either. When I brought up Darin, Lawrence blew up.

Lawrence: Darin? THE Fucking Darin?

Junior; Who's Darin?

Lawrence: An asshole that's who. He used to be a part of our crew until we found out he was shaving off money we made from these expeditions. Taking 'his' cut per se. When Cap found out about it and confronted Darin he denied it and quit our crew but soon he made his own. A rival crew to us. Ever since we tried to beat them to sites but never could, it was so strange how ahead he was of us. We would get going on the expedition then when we arrived Darin's crew was already there. They would leave hot chocolate for us to mock us. 

Cap: That's enough. Listen, we're going as planned. 

Lawrence: But Cap-

I cut him off with sternness in my voice.

Cap: WE are going as planned, Lawrence.

Lawrence was gonna give me grief the whole way. I was assured of it. We all grabbed our equipment and started to move out to the facility. We moved in silence most of the way until we saw it in the distance. The oval metal frames sitting in the snow. It was the facility. The report we got said it was abandoned for multiple decades and there were holes and rust everywhere, so why does it look brand new? When we approached the entrance I could see my reflection in the metal of the frames. Everything looked chrome and shiny. As if someone had fixed it as we walked towards it.

Tony: What the fuck?

Tony was shocked too.

Tony: I got a chipped tooth now from that stupid storm!

Lawrence: I wouldn't worry about your tooth, I'd be more concerned about your nose.

Tony: What? What's wrong with it?

Lawrence: It's too big for your face, it's like a moon settled down and your face was the living quarters.

Tony: Oh fuck off, Lawrence.

Everyone laughed and I admittedly laughed too. With all that's happened, we needed a good laugh. 

Bang!

Everyone stopped laughing. 

Bang! Bang! Bang!

We all looked at each other.

Lawrence: The fuck is that noise?

Tony: No way you're opening that door.

Tony was right but I knew if we stayed out here we would die from hypothermia and it wasn't a quick death. 

The noise coming from inside kept going. I looked back at my crew and gave one final assuring look before I opened the door. I was expecting something, anything to appear and attack us, I even grabbed my flashlight and turned it backwards to use the handle as a weapon. The door was unlocked and I opened it with ease even with the ice freezing the hinges. A loud metallic moan echoed through as the door made its way to the other side. 

Cap: What...the...hell?

There was nothing. Nothing that could make that noise we were hearing from outside. There was, however, a fire lit in the fireplace. A comforting smell filled the air as we walked inside. Warmth was all around us.

Lawrence: Son of bitch, they beat us again.

Lawrence pointed to a box on a log in front of the fireplace, it was a box of hot chocolate. Damn.

Cap: Appears so, Lawrence.

Tony yelled for me... 

Tony: Hey Cap!

...I turned to see him on the right side of the fireplace. He was looking at something on the far side. As I approached I could see him visibly disturbed.

Cap: What is it, Tony?

He didn't say anything. He only pointed to the corner of the room.

Cap: What the hell?

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. In the corner was a bunch of equipment that looked brand new. Some of them had Darin's crew logo on them. The others had the same logos as the snowmobiles. 

Cap: What's going on?

Bang! Bang! Bang!

We all nearly jumped out of our skin. We all faced where the noise was coming from. It was coming from down the hallway. 

Bang! Bang! Bang!

It sounded like someone was pounding on a metal door. We all looked at each other. Lawrence and Tony shook their heads at me. Sarah, Junior, and Mikey didn't do anything they just stood there, frozen. 

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Mikey: Hey Cap, here.

Mikey walked over to his equipment bag and dug around in there for a second until he pulled out a revolver. He threw the gun at me and I barely caught it. I yelled at him.

Cap: What the hell are you doing throwing this at me?!

Mikey: I trust you cap, I knew you would catch it.

Cap: Yea? And what if I didn't and it accidentally went off?

Mikey: I'm sorry, Cap. I just thought you might need it, is all. 

Cap: You're a damn fool for that, Mikey.

We kept at it for a few seconds until Sarah spoke up...

Sarah: Hey guys, wait. Why did it stop?

It took us a couple of seconds to realize the banging noise stopped. I moved forward. I was working my way down the hallway. Slowly but surely. I got to the first door in the hallway. A big metal door loomed in front of me. I saw the handle but my hand wouldn't move. It was shaking profusely. I pushed my fear away from me and started thinking of something else to ease my mind and open the door. I started thinking of my crew and us making it home, safe and sound. It was enough for me to grab the handle of the door, squeeze it tightly, and push open the door.

Another loud moan of metal reverberated in my ears as I peered into the darkness of the doorway. As I started to shine my flashlight inside to get a better look, something jumped out at me. It grabbed me and threw us to the ground. We grappled each other for a while until I saw Tony and Mikey grab the assailant off me and throw him to the ground. He got up and grabbed Mikey's collar to throw a punch but I guessed he lost all his energy because he fell onto his knees and started sobbing. I got up to see everyone's shocked looks as I saw who the assailant was. 

Cap: Darin?

There he was, Darin my rival on his knees seemingly begging for his life. His clothes looked aged and torn, he had multiple cuts, and his eyes were distant. He wasn't here with us. Not mentally at least. I walked up to him. He was muttering to himself. I knelt to hear what he was saying. 

Darin: The...doorway...the doorway is real.

He must've been in shock. He wasn't making any sense. Doorway? What doorway? I grabbed his shoulder. His eyes shifted to mine and anger entered his voice. He grabbed my jacket and just kept yelling...

Darin: THE DOORWAY IS OPEN!!! IT'S OPEN!!! WE LET IT OUT!!! GOD HELP US WE LET IT OUT!!!

He fell to the floor and started sobbing, repeating himself.

Darin: We let it out...we let it out.

He's been that way ever since. We never moved him. It's been a few hours and darkness has enveloped the facility. We have nowhere to go with that weather. We have no reception here except for my laptop. That's what I am writing all this on. I don't get it. Our radio isn't working at the moment and right now we're holding out as best we can. Luckily we brought enough supplies to last quite a while, I just hope the situation doesn't go from bad to worse. I should probably get some sleep. I'll use the storm to help me sleep. I'll provide an update tomorrow. God help us through this. Help us.
