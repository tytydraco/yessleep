 
I’ve been having the same dream every night for the past week. It starts the same way—every single time. I go to sleep, and then, the next thing I know, I’m in this completely pitch-black room. There’s nothing in it. No furniture, no doors, no windows—just this empty, endless void. The weird part is, I can see my own body clearly. It's like I’m glowing, but not in a helpful way. I’m lighting up the space around me, but the darkness just swallows it all up. It’s as if the light doesn't even exist, just… vanishes.
 
At some point, I turn around and see it. A telephone booth. The kind you’d expect to see in an ‘80s movie set in New York, bright and almost out of place in the middle of this nothingness. And every time I see it, I get this strange urge to walk toward it, like it’s calling me. And I don’t even fight it. I walk closer and closer, and with every step, the phone gets louder. Ringing louder. More urgent.
 
But every night, right when my hand is about to grab the phone, I suddenly wake up. Every single time. Like my brain knows I shouldn’t answer it, so it yanks me out of the dream just before I answer. I brushed these dreams off at first—just a weird, recurring dream. No big deal.
 
Until, last night, when my whole reality changed.
 
This time, instead of being in the pitch-black room, I was sitting in my living room, at my own dining room table. The same phone from the booth was sitting there, right in front of me and it was ringing. I checked the clock above my fireplace, it was 3:42 AM. I can’t explain why I knew that, but I did. I then reached for the phone without thinking, like it was the most natural thing in the world.
 
“Hello?” I answered, my voice groggy, like I’d just woken up from a deep sleep. Which was weird because I wasn’t tired. In fact, I felt too awake. Too aware for it to be a dream.
 
Then, I heard it.
 
“Hi, honey,” the voice said. Soft, warm.
 
“It’s Grandma.”
 
I froze.
 
For a second, I couldn’t even breathe. I wasn’t sure if I was hearing things or if I was just imagining it, but I knew it was her. There was no mistaking it. The way she said “honey”, I could almost feel her smile.
 
She started talking about random stuff, how my mom was doing, if I was eating enough, the kind of things she always asked. It felt so real. So familiar.
But then something started to feel off. There was this low, almost imperceptible crackling in the background, like an old phone line on the verge of cutting out. I figured it was just static at first, but it kept getting louder, more intense. The static wasn’t the only thing bothering me. The more we talked, the more distant her voice started to feel. Like she was right there, but also, not.
She asked me if I was “okay.” That should’ve been a simple question, but the way she said it felt wrong. Like there was something more to it, something I couldn’t put my finger on.
I asked her what she meant by that, but there was a long pause. The static grew louder, more intense, and I couldn’t get any words out. It felt like the space between us was growing wider. The conversation felt forced, like we were both trying too hard to hold onto something that wasn’t there anymore.
 
Then, without warning, the line cut off. Not abruptly, just slowly, like the sound was getting farther and farther away. I woke up instantly, my heart pounding. I grabbed my phone, hoping that it had all been part of some weird dream, but when I checked the time.
 
It was still 3:42 AM.
 
I felt completely disoriented. Like something wasn’t right. The dream felt too real, too vivid. I couldn’t explain it, but it left this lingering feeling of emptiness. Something was off, but I couldn’t figure out what.
 
The next night, it happened again. I was sitting in the same spot, the phone ringing, Grandma’s voice on the other end. At first, it was just like the first time—warm, comforting. But this time, I noticed the details. The sounds in the background weren’t the same. It was like I could hear something else, just barely, like scratching at the line.
 
She kept asking me if I was “sure” I was okay, like she was checking for something. Her voice didn’t sound quite right. She was speaking in a way that felt like she was trying to remember something. It didn’t feel like my grandma anymore. And that’s when I realized.
 
This wasn’t her. It wasn’t her voice anymore, just something using it.
 
The static got worse. I could barely make out her words anymore.
 
“You’re not alone,” she said, but it didn’t sound like her. It was strained, like something was trying to force its way through.
 
Before I could say anything, the line cut out again. The crackling took over, and I woke up gasping for air, my heart racing. But when I checked my phone, there was nothing. No missed calls. No messages. Just silence.
 
And yet the feeling didn’t go away. That presence, whatever it was, was still there. I couldn’t shake it.
 
The next morning, everything felt different. The air felt thick, like something had shifted. And then, I kept hearing that faint ringing sound in the back of my mind. Every time I’d check my phone, it was just silent. But I couldn’t shake the ringing.
 
That night, I tried to stay awake. I didn’t want to fall asleep, but eventually, I did. And when I did, it was the same thing. The phone rang, Grandma’s voice came through, but this time it definitely wasn’t the same. She wasn’t asking about my day. She wasn’t giving advice. She sounded scared. Broken.
 
“It’s not just me… they’re coming for you.”
 
I felt my blood run cold. Then, the static came. Louder. Closer. It wasn’t just trying to reach me anymore.
 
It was overpowering everything.
 
I woke up, heart racing, but this time the room felt colder. Darker. I checked my phone, 3:42 AM, just like before. But once again, there was no call, no messages. Just silence.
 
But it wasn’t silent in my head. I could still hear her voice, faintly. The static, it was there too, buzzing in my ears. I don’t know how much longer I can keep waking up from this. The dreams don’t stop. They keep happening. Each time, the voice gets weaker, more distorted, but one thing’s clear.
 
It’s not Grandma. It never was.
 
Something else is using her voice to reach me. And whatever it is, it’s getting closer.
