 The first thing I remember is the snow. I stared out the window at the forest, freshly draped in a blanket of pure white. The cold seems to seep into the darkened room and into my bones. I glanced down and pulled my sweater tighter around myself, feeling a shiver run through my thin frame. The snow covered forest looked so bright in the midday sun, but the room was dark, cold and unfamiliar. I was seated in a thickly padded chair facing a desk. My clothes were simple but comfortable, gray sweatpants and sweater, and house shoes.  

The door opened as I began to stand. The noise startled me more than I thought it should have and I flinched back away from it. A man stood in the doorway, looking over a clip board. He was a tall, bald, black man with wire framed glasses. I noticed he was wearing a lab coat and assumed he was a doctor of some kind. He closed the door behind him and smiled as he looked up from the clip board. 

“How are we doing today?” he asked as he made his way across the room. 

I cleared my throat and spoke, “I'm...” I stopped. My voice, it was different, deeper and more aged. 

He sat down at the desk across from me and gave me a curious look, “Are you alright?” 

I nodded and continued, “I think so, I'm just a little confused. I'm not quite sure where I am, or how I got here.” 

A brief expression of disappointment crossed his face, which he quickly covered with a sympathetic nod. “Yes, of course. Why don't you tell me the last thing you remember and I will do my best to fill in the blanks.” 

I thought for a moment, I couldn't remember much of anything out of the ordinary. “Well, I had just gotten home from work and I was about to sit down and eat dinner with my family. Where are they by the way? Are they alright?” 

He sat back in his chair and studied me for a moment. I waited but he said nothing. 

“Well?” I prompted. I was beginning to feel panic rising in my chest. “Where is my family? Where am I?”  

Still he said nothing. 

“Answer me dammit!” I shouted. “What the hell is going on?” 

He raised his hands in a calming motion as the door opened and two big men in scrubs stepped into the office. 

“Is everything okay Dr.  Ross?” Asked the bigger of the two men. 

“Its fine Carl.” Said the Dr. waving them away.  

With a nod, they stepped back out into the hall and closed the door. 

“What is happening?” I asked in a slightly calmer tone. 

Dr. Ross cleared his throat and leaned forward on his elbows, “This isn't going to be easy to hear.” 

My heart pounded as tears began to fill my eyes, “Where is my family?”  

He stared into my eyes and spoke in an eerily calm voice, “This is the Orion mental health institute. You are a patient here and you have been a patient here since you were 16.” 

The statement stunned me for a moment. I shook my head, “If this is some kind of joke its in really fucking bad taste. Now tell me, where my family is?” I said standing up from my chair. 

He leaned back and spread his hands, “I'm afraid it isn't a joke. And, I'm afraid this isn't the first time we’ve had this conversation.”  

“This is such bull shit. Where is my wife and daughter?” I shouted and punched the desk. 

The two men came back in at the sound of the commotion. I whirled on them and raised my fists, “Don't you fucking come near me!”  

“Please Gage, calm down.” Said the Doctor. “Just sit down and talk to me.” 

“Shut up!” I demanded. Pointing at him. “I don't know what you people want with me and I don't care, I am leaving.” 

I tried to rush past the two men, I had to get out of that place, I had to find my family. But they were quick, they caught me easily. I fought them as hard as I could swinging out with wild punches and making contact with a few of them, but after a brief struggle they pinned me to the floor. I screamed and raged at them, trying anything to get loose. Suddenly there was a pinch on the back of my neck and slowly the fight went out of me. My vision faded to a pinpoint as I slipped into unconsciousness. 

 

When I woke up, I was on my side. My body ached and my head was pounding, I tried to sit up but my arms wouldn't move. I looked down to see them wrapped tightly across my chest. Claustrophobia set in and I began to panic, I tried and tried to move, but the straight jacket held me in place.  

“Help!” I shouted. “Someone please help me!” 

But no one came. I screamed and screamed, struggling against my restraints. My heart pounded in my chest as I tried to wriggle myself out of the straight jacket but it was no use. After a while I managed to get to my feet, but I had nowhere to go. The room was small and padded. I stood at the door and screamed for help until my throat was raw. 

Eventually I slumped back to the floor and began sobbing. Why was this happening to me? What had I done to deserve this? Where was my family? And why had the Doctor called me Gage? After a few more hours, exhaustion took its toll and I fell into a dreamless sleep. 

 

When I woke up, I was back in the office. I groggily glanced around the room. Snow was falling on the forest outside, it struck me again how bright it looked. 

“Good morning.” Said  Dr. Ross.  

I hadn't realized he was sitting at the desk. 

“How are we feeling today?” 

I glared at him, “Fuck you.” 

He smiled and nodded, “So, about the same then.” 

I started to stand but sat back down when I noticed the two big men were watching me from inside the office now. 

“Why am I here?” I asked.  

“I told you yesterday, you have been a patient here for some time now, nearly 15 years.” 

I nodded, “So you said. But, why?” 

“For your own safety.”  

I chuckled, “Sure. Well, I'm not feeling very safe right now.” 

He nodded, “I can certainly understand that. And I do apologize for having to restrain you overnight. But you did give us quite a fight.” 

I glanced back at the two men by the door, one of them had a visibly broken nose. 

“Look.” I said, doing my best to stay calm. “I don't know who you think I am but I'm pretty sure you have the wrong guy.” 

“Do we?” He asked, raising his eyebrows. 

“You called me Gage. Thats not my name.”  

“Oh? And who are you today?” 

I sat up a little straighter, “My name is Nick, I have a wife and daughter, I live in a small town in Oklahoma. I don't belong here.” 

Ross nodded as he opened a file folder and began to take notes on what I was saying. 

I smiled thinking he was finally listening to me. It had to have been some kind of mistake that I wound up here, this would be cleared up and I would be going home to my family. 

“You can call my wife, she will confirm everything I'm saying, He number is...”  

“6” He said cutting me off. 

I blinked in confusion, “What?” 

He sat back and smiled at me, “That makes your sixth personality.” 

I shook my head, “No you're not listening to me. I'm not crazy, my name is Nick and...” 

“Are you sure?” He asked cutting me off. “Are you sure you're not Sam, the detective from the future? Or the half dead drifter who can talk to ghosts? Or maybe you're the astronaut, hell bent on saving humanity from an alien virus.” 

I shook my head in disbelief, “What? Those are stories. Stories I wrote, they aren't other personalities. I'm a writer.” 

He squinted at me in confusion, “You know the stories of these people I've mentioned?” 

“Yes, of course I do. I wrote them. I'm a fiction writer, these are stories I made up and posted online.” 

He leaned forward and said, “Tell me every one of the stories you've written in as much detail as you possibly can.” 

So, I did. It took a while but I told him all of the stories I had written, named all the characters and gave hyper specific details. 

When I was done he sat back and studied me in silence for a long while. Finally he said, “That is very interesting. None of your other personalities know anything about each other. But you, you seem to be fully aware of each of them.” 

I sighed, “I'm not just aware, I created them, they are just characters.” 

“So you say. But aren't you just another character as well then?” 

“I'm real. I made them up.” 

“How do you know you're real?” He asked 

I shook my head, “Because I'm standing here talking to you, I'm here right now this is real, I'm real. And I have a real family I have to get back to.” 

He sighed long and sad, “I am sorry but you don't have a family, Nick isn't real. Your name is Gage and you have been my patient here for nearly 15 years.” 

‘God dammit, you aren't listening, I'm telling you...” 

“That is enough, I'm trying to help you. Nick isn't real!” 

I snapped. I leapt across the desk at him, “I’ll fucking show you how real I am!” I shouted, grabbing the front of his shirt, ready to drive my fist through his big fucking head. The two guards caught me before I could do any real damage, and the next thing I knew I was back in the padded cell.  

I spent the rest of that day in the straight jacket, squirming and pleading for help, for someone to listen to me, to hear what I was trying to tell them. That I wasn't crazy that I was real. 

That night, I thought of what Ross had said, about my stories being other personalities. It seemed ridiculous. but I felt doubt begin to creep its way into my fractured mind. What if he was right, how did I really know that I was the real me? 

My sleep was filled with dreams that were more like memories. I remembered driving on an endless road, filled with horrific nightmares in more detail than I could have ever imagined. I remembered bumming my way around the country, meeting ghosts, mostly trying to avoid them and sometimes helping them move on. I remembered a city of neon lights and a murder I had to solve. I remembered being infected with the alien consciousness, the feeling of it controlling my mind and body. Finally I remembered Gage. His life was a tapestry of pain and trauma, he retreated into himself when he was at his weakest. Imagined scenarios where he wasn't weak, where he was the hero. He lived in his head, in those fantasies. To him reality was misery. As I walked through the dreaming realm I began to understand, to see the truth threaded among the stories and memories and fantasies. In all the lives I've lived.  I knew now, what I needed to do. 

 

“How are we feeling this morning?” Asked Dr Ross. 

I smiled and took a deep breath. “I'm feeling good.” 

He raised his eyebrows at me, “And who am I speaking with today.” 

“Me.”  

He grinned, “Which you?” 

I glanced around the room at the two guards at the door, and the bright snow outside the window.  

Ross cleared his throat and asked again, “Which you am I speaking with?”  

“All of me.” 

“You’re still Nick, aren't you?” 

“I'm whoever I need to be.” 

“You need to be yourself, Gage.” 

I nodded, “Yeah, you keep saying that, but I don't think you know what it means to be yourself.” 

“And you do?” He asked. 

“I think I'm starting to.” 

Ross leaned back and studied me for a moment, “You seem unusually calm, are you sure you're still Nick? You haven't mentioned your family yet.”  

I smiled, “They're not here. But, I know how to get back to them.” 

“How?”  

I smiled wide and closed my eyes, taking a deep breath and surrendering control.  

A few moments later I opened my eyes to find the two guards unconscious on the floor and sirens blaring throughout the institute. Dr. Ross cowered behind his desk, staring at me like I was some kind of demon. I could hear voices shouting from the hall, they were getting closer and I was running out of time.  

I grabbed the chair I had been sitting in. The cushions may have been extra padded foam but the legs were made of metal. I swung the chair as hard as I could, smashing it through the window to the forest. I stepped up and looked over the edge, 4 stories up with a parking lot below.  

“Gage!” Shouted Ross. “Don't, I can help you! I can fix you!”  

I looked back and met his eyes, “You couldn't fix him Ross and you'd never have let him out. You just lock him up time and time again. This is where Gages story ends.” 

I leaned forward and let gravity do the rest. I stared out at the snow covered forest as I fell, it really was beautiful. 

 

Suddenly I jolted awake in bed, breathing heavily. I sigh in relief as I realize it is my bed. I smiled as I looked over to see my wife sleeping next to me. I gently leaned over and kissed her cheek before going to check on my daughter, still fast asleep. I headed to my office and opened my computer and began typing this. Maybe it was just a dream, it probably was. But what if it was something more. What if Gage was me in  another universe, calling out for help to the only one who could ever really understand him. I mean that's what I did in the dream, I needed someone who could fight. Some one who could give me the opportunity to help set Gage free. I have no idea who it was that took control, but does it really matter? It was me, or at least a version of me. 

This dream or whatever it was has thrown my whole conception of reality into question. I told Ross I was real because I was talking to him, because I was there, but I'm not even sure that was real. So how can I be sure that I am even real? Am I real because I believe I am or because others perceive me? As I sit here staring off into the middle distance, into the space between spaces, its like I can see it. The words that I have been typing laid out in reverse on a screen, a face, illuminated in the darkness. Am I only real because you are reading this? If so, what happens when I stop typing?
