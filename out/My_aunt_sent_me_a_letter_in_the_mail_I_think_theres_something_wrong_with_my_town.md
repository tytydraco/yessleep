Hello, reddit. My name’s Adam. I’m 18 and a senior in high school. I already knew there was something off about Hallowville. There's been about five disappearances over the past year. Anyway, my Aunt Brandi is somewhat estranged. She left right after some accident during her summer before college. I met her one time growing up, at my grandma's funeral. She didn't talk. We never really had a relationship, so I was a bit confused when a letter from her appeared in an envelope addressed from Vanderbilt. I am posting this here because I don’t know where else to go. I’m not sure what this means for my family or friends, but as soon as I get my diploma, I’m leaving this town.

(the letter starts below)

I didn’t deserve what happened to me. I know, that’s a bit egotistical. But really, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. Aside from the injury, I was… seeing things. For weeks, I felt reality escape my mind’s desperate grasp. The lines between what was real and what was an image conjured by my false perception of reality have blurred over the years.

You know that I could hardly wait to get out of this small town. Don’t get me wrong, Hallowville is a cute little dot on the map I had assumed was worth visiting, but at this point, I had been living there for seventeen years. I was beyond ready to go. I didn’t have dreams, I had plans. I was going to graduate as the valedictorian out of seventy two students, then I’d go to Harvard and study law. Once I had enough money, I planned on moving my family out to Massachusetts with me. 

This all happened in 1998, so you’d think I wouldn’t remember any minute details but… I remember everything. My memory may have been jumbled but I can still feel the saw’s jagged edges going through my skin and the vibrations proliferating in my entire body as the metal hit my bones…

It was the summer after my senior year. I had already gotten accepted into Harvard, and I was just trying to save up as much money as I could. Even then, renting an apartment out of state was a huge hassle. Aside from babysitting, walking dogs, and mowing lawns, I had a “steady” job as a host in the only restaurant in town, Timberwolf Lodge. 

“Heather, can you seat this next family?” I asked the curly haired blonde girl. 

She raised an eyebrow, chewing her gum behind the counter. “Why can’t you?” there was spite in her voice. I would have been mad if she hadn’t already been covering the only other host, Imogene’s, shift. None of us wanted to be there, but working was the only way to get through life.

At this point, I had already begun to remove my apron, relying on the off chance that Heather wasn’t already fed up with the nagging customers of the evening. “I.. I’m off in two minutes. My birthday party is in an hour.” 

“It’s your birthday?” Heather stood up. “Brandi, why are you working?”

“Imogene’s sick and I didn’t want you working the rush alone,” I told her.

Heather let out a scoff. “At an Olive Garden, maybe. But we get like four families during our “rush.””

I grabbed the notepad and marked the time. “Thank you so much, Heather. I owe you.”

“I know. Happy birthday!” Heather waved me out.

As I left the building, cold rain drops fell upon my skin. A chill ran down my spine, but I smiled regardless. Besides the fact that it was my birthday, gloomy weather was my favorite. Living in central Texas, I was no stranger to humidity. But this storm was fresh, crisp. There was no heat lingering in the air, as though Mother Nature herself played a part in planning my birthday party.

In the parking lot, I spotted a brand new black Dodge Challenger. With a smile, I strolled over and spotted a young man sleeping, his messy black hair pressed against the window. I brought up my fist and knocked on the glass. “Are you loitering, sir?”

The man stirred awake, his eyes meeting mine. He rolled down the window, a relieved smile on his lips. “There she is!” I heard the melodic sound of love ring in my ears. “My gorgeous birthday girl!”

I leaned in through the driver’s side window, stealing a quick kiss from my boyfriend of nearly two years. “What time did you get here?”

He shrugged as I made my way around to the passenger’s seat. “Like.. an hour ago?”

I buckled myself in, letting out a breath I didn’t know I was holding. “We should be home with enough time to get dressed and set the table if Angie hasn’t yet. Is the ice in the trunk or did you drop it off at my house?”

Matty spared me a sheepish smile. “I may or may not have forgotten.”

“Matty!” I scolded, looking over my shoulder to check if he was joking or not. “You had an hour of nap time to get it!”

“I’m sorry, I had to get.. something ready and it slipped my mind,” he put his hand on mine. “Really, I’m sorry, Brandi.”

“It’s okay, it’s okay, really,” I let out a sigh, taking out my pager. “I’ll let my sister know.”

“I already paged her,” he shook his head. “We knew you’d need a couple hours of leeway, so we pushed the party back.”

I felt a mix of relief and frustration wash over me. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” 

Matty smiled, shrugging. “You'll find out in a couple minutes.”

I furrowed my eyebrows, could he be any more ominous? I stayed quiet, both nervous and excited for what he had planned. Matty had never been the most adventurous person, but perhaps it was because his mind was constantly off in other worlds. Matty was an aspiring author, and he too would be going up north for school. Granted, we would be a few hours away from each other, but it was better than being halfway across the country. 

My eyes fixed on a small, still figure in the distance. I squinted, noticing a familiar car on the side of the road, its hazard lights periodically illuminating the rain. “Is that Mr. Rinefer?”

Indeed, on the side of FM-77, a sixty year old man stepped out of his 1956 Ford F100. Mr. Rinefer was a tall, lanky man with wire-framed square glasses that sat on the tip of his nose. He wore a pale blue glare through them to indicate how superior he thought he was. He had a large slouch from grading papers at his old age, displaying his complete disregard for his appearance. His gray-white hair was naturally slicked back, resembling a 1950’s greaser.

“I could never be a teacher,” Matty said, his eyes following Rinefer as we drew closer. “Poor guy doesn’t get paid enough to afford a new tire.”

“Should we help him?” I asked. 

Mr. Rinefer would have been the oldest man in town, but he lived just on the edge of Hallowville and Sycamore, moreso in the latter. Sure, there was a creepy aspect about his demeanor, but he was a nice guy nonetheless. I pushed down my inherent fear of older men whenever we faced each other. I could never bring myself to let my eyes meet him, and when they did, I felt my heart drop and stomach curl. Despite his appearance, Rinefer was a great teacher. Without him, I wouldn’t have passed AP Biology. 

Matty paused for a moment, slowing the car down against his better judgment. “Damn it- Hey, Mr. Rinefer!” he cheerfully chirped as he rolled down the passenger side window. “Need some help?”

“Matthew!” Rinefer greeted in a way that displayed his hidden embarrassment. He cleared his throat. “I think I’ll be okay.”

“Are you sure?” I asked him. “Wouldn’t you wanna wait out the rain?” 

Rinefer was a stubborn old man, but surely he wouldn’t risk his safety for his pride. “I’ll be okay, Brandi. The rain is on my side.”

“Um… okay,” Matty nodded. “Bye, Mr. Rinefer.”

I just smiled and waved, rolling up my window. I furrowed my eyebrows and looked at Matty. “Do all old people talk in riddles?”

Matty shrugged. “The man’s ancient. He probably invented riddles.”

I shifted back in my seat, looking out the right hand mirror. Mr. Rinefer was resting against his car, his face tilted up towards the clouds. What a weird guy. “Mhm.. Freak,” I chimed.

“You’re the one who wanted to stop,” Matty reminded, laughing.

I pursed my lips as the old teacher disappeared from view, rain blurring his hazard lights. “I hope he’ll be okay… I wish we knew someone to call for him.”

“I’m sure he’ll be fine. Now, close your eyes,” he told me, slowing down. 

I didn’t bother objecting, my trust completely laid in his hands. I let out a breath as I heard Matty’s panicked rustling beside me. “You okay?”

“This isn’t how it was supposed to go…” he groaned.

I couldn’t help but open my eyes. I looked out the windshield, through the rain. There was a red and white checkered blanket, held down by four stones on each corner. Pillows and blankets and roses, now all drenched in rain.

I smiled and turned to Matty. “It’s… it’s a sweet sentiment.”

“I put up a canopy, I swear,” he took my hand. “I guess I underestimated the storm.”

“Hey, we can have a picnic in here,” I kissed his cheek with a wide grin. When I sat back down, I noticed Matty shake his leg, his hands in his lap. Something was bothering him. “What’s wrong?”

His eyes flickered from me to the window. “I drank a lot of Mountain Dew when I was waiting for you.”

I let out a snort, covering my mouth. “Sorry.. Just… Go. And be careful.”

Matty nodded, grabbing a small bottle of hand sanitizer as he traveled into the woods. I hadn’t noticed that the rain was even worse here than on the road. I hoped Matty would stay safe, and be quick. I bounced my knee as I waited for the boy to return. How romantic. I looked out into the unfamiliar forest. I knew many kids had gone to this clearing before. Our very own Lover’s Lane. Even then, it was a cheesy cliche. I was sure that some movie buff saw it in theaters and chose to replicate it. 

After some time, I averted my gaze into the direction Matty had gone. I looked at my watch, it had been nearly ten minutes since he had left. Scenarios played out in my head, I was unable to see the tree that Matty disappeared behind. I rolled down the window, squinting my eyes to make out silhouettes in the rain. I thought I saw a figure, who looked about Matty’s size.

“Matty?” I called out to no response. 

After an internal argument, against my better judgment I let out a breath and opened the car door. The wind whirled around me, whipping heavy rain into my face. With a groan, I continued into the woods, looking back to the sanctuary of the car behind me. A part of me was rationalizing why Matty was taking so long, but my anxiety got the better of me. My steps were heavy, mud already forming on the earth’s surface beneath me. 

I walked deeper into the woods and found something odd. At first, I thought it was a cabin, but upon close inspection, it appeared to be a tight-knit ring of trees acting as a barrier. I circled around the trees, looking for some sort of entrance. I found a thick set of vines that, though heavy, could be pushed back to walk through. I stepped through the vines, the atmosphere instantly shifting. Though the rain was dense and the wind was coarse, it seemed as if this ring of trees was in an entirely different space altogether. I could still see the dark clouds above, but the leaves were so tightly packed together that rain only trickled in in certain spots.

I furrowed my eyebrows, unable to fully comprehend the setting laid before me. A well. A wishing well with a square stone base. The top of the roof was at least six feet high, and when I got closer, I realized why it was so big. A metal trapdoor was open, revealing steps leading downward into a dark abyss. I focused my eyes, the faint glow of flickering candlelight at the bottom.

I felt my heart drop at the eerie sight. “Matty?!” I called down.

The wind and rain stilled. A sinister silence plagued the clearing. I’m not sure if I was tuning out everything else, or if every creature on earth decided to quiet, but I didn’t hear a single whisper. It was as though nature itself paused.

“Brandi?” 

The word sent a chill down my spine. Something about that voice was desperate, but as I recalled it in my mind I couldn’t discern its source. The voice had to be Matty’s, that was the only reasonable explanation. I’d usually have no second thought, but the speaker sounded angry, injured.

“Matty, are you okay?” I called down. He didn’t respond. I took a breath, looking down the stairs. The stairway itself was dim, but there was a light at the bottom. “Matty?” my voice was small, pleading. 

I was waiting for him to run up the stairs, laughing at his sick and twisted attempt at comedy, but he never did. I heard a loud, earsplitting screech. I let out a groan and ran back to the car, grabbing a flashlight. As I shut the door, a wave of regret washed over me: I had left the keys in the car. I reached my hand through the rolled down window, opening it up from the inside. The alarm suddenly blared in my ears, the hazard lights flashing, momentarily illuminating the heavy drops of the downpour. I frantically pushed the unlock button, but the alarm would not stop.

With a noise full of frustration and anxiety, I ran back to the ring of trees. I pushed past the vine, sharp leaves leaving paper like cuts on my arms as I shielded my face. I swallowed and turned the flashlight as I approached the well. I looked down, illuminating the steps below me. The stairs were made entirely of stone, its creators not bothering to smooth the jagged edges down. I carefully stepped down, my every movement echoing through the hallowed tunnels. As I neared the bottom, I realized the flickering I saw was from the many sconces lining the stone walls. I looked around, pointing my flashlight through the dimly lit hallway.

I noticed a nearby archway, leading to a room lit by a white light. As I approached the room, the scent of bleach and other chemicals burnt my nose. I brought my hand to cover my mouth and nose as I entered. It was another tunnel. This one was wider, and lined with metal doors on either side. I brought my flashlight up, trying to see the end of the tunnel. Before I could spot the end, I felt a pair of hands wrap around me. I struggled in the sudden grip, every defense mechanism kicking in. A cloth was brought to my mouth and I tried my best to hold my breath, but my body acted against my wishes. I took in a deep, deprived gasp for air, the ancient stone around me disappearing completely.

When I woke up, I couldn’t move. There were no restraints, but some invisible force was locking me down onto the icy steel table beneath me. There was an immense pressure plaguing my entire body, particularly my chest. I could barely breathe because of a burning sensation in my throat. Steps echoed in the empty halls. My head reeled as I tried to turn my head to see where the noise was coming from. The air became thicker as my breath became rapid. I was stuck in a body with total loss of control. 

The steps became louder and I heard it again, the screeching. It wasn’t until then did I realize that it was the thick, metal door. I tried to scream, but felt the burn in my throat worsen. Hot tears trickled down either side of my face like melting candle wax. I felt like I was breathing through a piece of cloth, no amount of pleading, deep breaths could calm me down. I knew I should have steadied my breath but there was no point. I was going to die on that rusty operating table.

The footsteps came to a stop right beside me, just out of my peripheral vision. The sound of a drill drowned out my thoughts as the figure dressed in white walked down to my hips. He looked me in the eyes, and though his mouth was covered with a surgical mask, the manic crinkle in his eyes gave away his true level of lunacy.

When the saw first touched my skin, I thought that maybe he was just bluffing, a sadistic sort of play date. But when he broke skin within the very first slice, I knew that this was no joke. People say that your adrenaline spikes when in danger so that you do not feel pain as intensely. But I felt it. I felt every single movement in that jagged, rusty saw. 

I wanted so desperately to scream, to cry, to plead, to anything. But the possibility simply wasn’t there, the fire in my throat roaring over any attempt at noise. I settled for muffled groans as the saw went deeper and deeper into my thigh. My breathing didn’t even hitch, I couldn’t control it. The pain was gut wrenching, and I could do nothing to stop it. I couldn’t stop it. As the saw touched my bone, I saw stars. I felt my body twitch and I passed out once again.

When I woke up, I felt a burning sensation around my left thigh. I reached out, my arms finally obeying my command. My hand touched the cold metal table, so I felt around my thigh, only to find… nothing. My heart sunk, nausea plaguing my body. My entire left leg below my mid thigh was gone. The room was still, the air thick with the scent of metal and bleach. I was gaining consciousness faster this time, the aching pain from my leg shooting up my entire body. I reached out towards the scalpel on the table, the smallest sense of safety and hope rushing over me. But the cart rolled away, and the figure of the Surgeon came into view.

He was carrying my leg. My fucking leg. I saw it sit stiffly in his arms, a stolen trophy. He set it down on a metal table, grabbing a nearby rusty wheelchair. He turned back to face me, the manic glint in his eyes ever present. My hands fell to my side once more and I lay still on the table, a corpse ready for examination. As the Surgeon came close to my right side, he clicked the wheelchair in place. Fear washed over my every being. Where was he planning to take me? He pushed a piece of my hair away from my face, his cruel, ungloved hands were rough and calloused. He leaned down and brought his masked face near my neck, his body hovering over me. The Surgeon sniffed in a breath, an animalistic noise filling my ears.

My hand shot up, digging the car keys into his neck. The Surgeon let out a pathetic cry as blood sprayed onto my face. I closed my mouth and yanked the keys out, stabbing him once again. His body slowly fell onto mine as I continued to stab his neck over and over again, only stopping when his body slipped to the floor. I looked down at his limp body, the image hasn’t left my mind since. I sat up, my head pounding. I wiggled my body to the edge of the table, throwing myself into the wheelchair.

I rolled the wheelchair forward, my hands flinching at the cold touch. Squeaky wheels echoing throughout the narrow stone halls. I hit the base of the stairs, projecting onto the steps in front of me. I felt my arms scrape against the un-chiseled rock, my nails ripping from their beds. I forced the pain out of my mind. I was so close to freedom, I couldn’t let a little blood stop me. I crawled up the stairs at an agonizingly slow pace. I’m not sure if it was my mind's thoughts clouding reality, but I could have sworn I heard footsteps behind me.

I fell out of the well, rolling on the ground. I still didn’t feel safe. I dug my nails into the earth below me, my mind begging for the release of both my physical and mental anguish. I was close, so close to the vines. I saw red and blue flashing lights, my salvation was mere yards away. I reached my hand through the vine, the leaves denying my exit. I clawed at the hanging plants once more, but my shaky hand could not penetrate the barrier.

Then the hand of Death reached out for me. Pale, boney, and welcoming. I accepted, my fingers grasping his. Both hands wrapped around my wrist and pulled me out. The rain had stopped, but the grass was still damp. I rolled onto my back, taking heavy breaths of relief. I did it. I made it out. I looked up at my savior, my eyes meeting his pale blue gaze.

“Mr. Rinefer,” I cheered, though it probably came out as a rasp. 

My throat was still burning. I reached my hand up to put pressure on the pain, realizing there was a large gash through it. The blood beginning to scab, but every breath was fire. Mr. Rinefer sat beside me on the ground as the police officers spoke to me, the EMTs readying the gurney. I couldn’t speak, only communicating through nods and head shakes. When we got to the hospital, Sheriff Shaw was waiting in my room. Or maybe he got there after I woke up. I think they stitched up my neck before we first spoke, but I swear I remember him before that.

“So you were walking in the woods and found the well, correct?” Shaw had asked. I tried to answer, unable to speak because of the swelling in my vocal chords. “Then you slipped and hit your head.” 

‘No, no I didn’t. I know I didn’t,’ I shook my head to the best of my ability, the sedatives thwarting my efforts to make any movement. 

“Johnathan, where is she?” I heard the familiar stern voice of my mother. She was in her blue scrubs, or maybe they were purple. She had been crying, or maybe she was tired. She turned to me, her eyes flashing with something I couldn't read even if I wasn’t dazed. “My baby.. My sweet girl!” She wrapped her arms around my broken body. “What did they do?”

“Janet,” Shaw called, though I swear it sounded like a warning. “She had an accident in the storm. She fell and cut her leg on some rusty metal. They had to amputate it.”

Mom wiped her tears, her eyes not leaving my face. “It’s gonna be okay. I promise this will never happen again.” 

That night, when they believed I was asleep, I heard Shaw and Mom arguing through harsh whispers.

“Give me the name of her Surgeon.”

“Janet-” he began.

“Don’t fucking argue, John, I’ll make sure the clinic goes under.”

“And how would you do that?”

“You know I- She’s awake.” My mother’s voice suddenly turned dark.

I felt my heart drop as I stirred awake, opening my eyes. Better to fess up now than get caught in a deeper hole. Sheepishly, I looked between the two. Shaw eyed me, then turned to my mother. 

“She’ll never speak again, right?” he asked. Mom pursed her lips, nodding. Shaw stepped closer to me. He leaned in, so that only I could hear him. “Don’t mistake your luck with resilience. Next time you stick your nose in places it doesn’t belong, you’ll end up gutted and torn apart like your boyfriend.”

I couldn’t control myself. No amount of physical pain I endured that day compared to how tightly my heart twisted at the mention of Matty’s death. I leaned over the bed and threw up onto the ground beside me, tears streaming down my face. I never did speak again, not to the police, not to Mom, not to your mother. I didn’t end up going to law school, instead settling for being a stenographer. 

I’m writing to you because I don’t know who else to trust. Adam, it’s happening again. I know you’ve had peers go missing, I’ve read it online. I don’t know exactly what Shaw was covering up, but I can’t let you become his next victim. Your mother.. I love Angela, but I think Mom shared a little more with her. Something that has to do with the Surgeon. It may not be the same person, but it’s happening again. Keep your eyes open and your friends close. Remember, as soon as you graduate, you have an open invitation to Massachusetts with me. Don’t tell anyone, not until your plane has landed. Good luck, Adam.
