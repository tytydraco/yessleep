I've been delivering medical supplies to rural clinics for three years. Most of my route covers isolated areas where small towns have tiny medical facilities that serve farming communities. It's steady work, nothing exciting.

Except for one clinic in the hills.

They started ordering from us six months ago. Standard medical supplies at first - bandages, syringes, basic medications. But then they began requesting expired blood products. Not recently expired - blood that had been sitting in our storage for years.

Blood expires after 42 days. This stuff was from 2019, 2020, even earlier. Blood that should have been incinerated long ago but somehow got missed in our disposal cycles.

The first few times, I assumed it was an administrative error. I'd call the clinic to confirm the order, but they always insisted they needed exactly what they'd requested. "The older the better," the receptionist would say in this cheerful voice that made my skin crawl.

The clinic is about forty miles outside town, nestled in a valley surrounded by dense forest. It's a small building that looks more like a house than a medical facility. No signage, no parking lot, just a gravel driveway and a front door painted bright red.

Every delivery, the same elderly man meets me at the door. He's always wearing scrubs that look decades old, faded and stained. He takes the blood products immediately but leaves the other supplies sitting in boxes by the entrance.

"The blood is priority," he always says. "Everything else can wait."

Last month, I arrived during what sounded like a procedure in progress. I could hear medical equipment beeping and multiple voices talking in urgent, clipped tones. Through the window, I saw shadows moving quickly around what looked like an operating table.

But the strangest part was the smell. Not antiseptic or medical - something sweet and metallic that made me nauseated.

I knocked and waited. The voices inside went silent immediately, but the medical equipment kept beeping. After five minutes, the elderly man opened the door looking flustered.

"You're early," he said, though I was actually ten minutes late.

"Should I come back later?"

"No, no. Just leave everything here." He gestured to the doorway without taking his eyes off me. Behind him, I could see multiple people in scrubs standing perfectly still, like they were waiting for me to leave.

That's when I noticed the floor. Dark stains spread across what should have been clean medical tile, leading from the entrance toward the back rooms. Fresh stains.

"What kind of procedures do you perform here?" I asked.

His smile was wrong. Too wide, showing teeth that were gray and pointed. "We specialize in blood disorders. Very rare conditions that require... vintage treatments."

I left quickly that day, but I couldn't stop thinking about those stains. Or the fact that they'd ordered sixty units of expired blood that week alone. Enough for major surgery, but what kind of surgery requires decades-old blood?

Two weeks ago, I made a mistake. I arrived at the clinic but forgot to bring their main order - forty units of blood from 2018. I only had current supplies in my truck.

When I explained the situation, the elderly man's expression changed completely. His fake pleasant demeanor vanished, replaced by something predatory.

"We need the old blood," he said. "Only the old blood works for our patients."

"I can bring it tomorrowâ€”"

"Our patient is on the table now. She's been waiting for hours."

Through the window, I could see someone lying on the operating table in the back room. But they weren't moving. At all. No chest rising and falling, no shifting position. They looked like a corpse.

"Is your patient... alive?" I asked.

"She will be," he said. "Once we give her what she needs."

I got back in my truck immediately and drove away. In my rearview mirror, I saw multiple figures in scrubs come outside and watch me leave. They stood there until I was completely out of sight.

I tried researching the clinic online but found nothing. No medical license, no business registration, no records of it existing at all. The address officially belongs to an empty lot.

But they keep placing orders. Fifty units last week. Seventy units yesterday. All expired blood dating back years.

I stopped delivering there personally and sent my assistant instead. He came back pale and shaking.

"There were bodies," he whispered. "On tables throughout the building. Dozens of them. Some looked fresh, others looked... old. Really old. But they were all connected to IV drips of that black, spoiled blood."

"Were they alive?"

"I don't know. But when I walked past, some of them opened their eyes and looked at me."

We reported it to the sheriff, but when deputies went to investigate, they found only an empty building. No medical equipment, no bodies, no evidence of any activity.

But the orders keep coming. And now they're not just requesting expired blood.

Yesterday's order included: "Seeking blood products from 1987-1995. Any available inventory from deceased donors preferred. Urgent need for long-term preservation specimens."

Blood from people who died decades ago. Blood that's been sitting in freezers for longer than I've been alive.

I think whatever's in that clinic isn't treating patients.

I think it's creating them.
