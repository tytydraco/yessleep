You’ll think I’ve gone mad—but that matters little now.

The story I’m about to tell really happened, and I still feel its effects to this day. May God have mercy on anyone who dares to venture where I once went…

It all began on the day they brought in that strange man—may he be cursed for all eternity. I’ll never forget that day. The sun blazed in the sky, the fans in my office were running at full power, and still I had to take off my coat and undo the top buttons of my shirt just to stay conscious. We’d finished the daily rounds, and I had hoped to lose myself in paperwork to make the hours pass faster. But then C., one of the nurses, appeared at the door, asking me to report to the emergency intake immediately.

With a heavy heart, I hauled myself out of the chair, threw on my white coat, and trudged toward the ambulance wing.

The man was flailing like a fish out of water. Four orderlies were barely managing to hold the stretcher down, and the straps binding his wrists, ankles, and waist were creaking ominously, threatening to give way at any moment. Seeing this, I quickened my pace, calling out from afar for the nurse to prepare a strong dose of tranquilizers.

Together with C., we pinned the patient’s forearm to the bed while nurse injected the full load of an improvised cocktail. The amount would’ve knocked out a horse, so I wasn’t surprised when the man spasmed a few more times before finally slumping limp onto the stretcher. He was mumbling something, but at that point it didn’t matter. I performed a basic physical assessment and ordered him to be locked in isolation. We wouldn’t get anything useful out of him yet.

C. handed me the report filled out by the police upon transferring the patient. They had responded to a call from a concerned mother out walking with her child. She had spotted a man behaving erratically—sometimes running, sometimes crawling across a riverside meadow, tossing handfuls of soil into the air, and occasionally pulling things from the ground and stuffing them into his mouth. When the patrol arrived, they had to call for two more officers just to restrain him. But he thrashed and screamed so violently that they decided to send him straight to the loony bin—which meant us.

I spent some time with paperwork and then decided to check on our new resident. Enough time had passed for the sedatives to wear off a bit, and I hoped to at least exchange a few words. Outside the isolation room, I ran into C. again, who had been checking on the man periodically. He told me the patient was more or less conscious, had calmed down, and though he was still strapped to the bed, he seemed harmless enough.

When I entered the little room, the man fixed me with an intense stare. Only now could I get a proper look at him—his eyes were blue, sharp, almost youthful, but something mad flickered behind them. After over two decades of practice, I could spot that kind of glint easily. His face was covered in an unkempt beard, now smeared with dirt, merging in places with long gray hair that hung to his elbows. But he didn’t look old—forty-something at most. He didn’t take his eyes off me as I pulled up a chair and sat beside the bed.

I didn’t even need to ask—he started speaking on his own.

He told me about his travels—how he had roamed the world in search of a single book, and how he had finally found it in a forgotten little antiquarian shop on the outskirts of Amsterdam. He explained why the pursuit of that volume had become more important than anything else in his life. Finally, in a whisper, he confessed that he had to uncover ancient secrets to put an end, once and for all, to a matter from his past.

When I asked why he had been shoving dirt into his mouth, he scoffed with contempt, as if it were the most trivial thing in the world—as if I were being petty. He simply explained that life resides in the soil. Then he fell silent and would not answer another question.

I wished him good night, stood up, pushed the chair back, and walked toward the door. As I laid my hand on the handle, I heard him say, quietly but clearly:

“It’s beneath us.”

The guys had recorded our mystery patient’s personal data. Sadly, the police couldn’t locate any next of kin—because there were none. As they’d determined, his daughter had died under mysterious circumstances at the age of six, and his wife, unable to cope with the grief, had taken her own life a year later. That would have been about two years before he ended up in our ward. That explained the travels he mentioned. Nothing tied him to any one place, so he dealt with the pain in his own way.

What haunted me most was the book. He spoke of it with a mix of reverence and fear. He never once mentioned its title. Something told me either it was the ravings of a madman… or the key to the whole mystery.

He seemed like a man engulfed by deep paranoia, suspended somewhere between reality and hallucination, but I couldn’t shake the sense that there was some deeper meaning behind it all.

I asked C. to hand over the man’s personal effects. He didn’t have much on him: keys, a wallet with an ID and some small change, and a notebook. That last item caught my attention, so I took it, signed the necessary forms, and went home. It was late anyway, and A. had probably gone to bed long ago.

To my surprise, I realized I had spent almost three hours in that damned isolation room. I could’ve sworn it hadn’t been more than forty minutes. But time, as we know, is a slippery thing.

The house was dark. I peeked into the bedroom—A. was fast asleep, her peaceful breathing soothing in its rhythm. I sat gently on the edge of the bed and brushed her hair back, even briefly considering whether to wake her up for a quickie.

That’s when I heard the scratching. It came from the basement.

The hair stood on the back of my neck.

I stood up slowly and tiptoed to the door leading to the cellar stairs. From the nearby closet I grabbed a flashlight and one of my golf clubs, then opened the door and quickly hit the light switch. The basement was instantly flooded with the harsh glow of fluorescent bulbs.

I began descending cautiously when the scratching sound returned. I was wrong—it wasn’t coming from the basement, but *beneath* it.

As if something were brushing against the foundation of the house.

I briefly considered whether construction had begun on a new metro line below us, but no—that line was over three hundred meters away.

The sound was unsettling, wrong. It scraped at my nerves, burrowed into my skull, tore at the inside of my ears. I waited for it to come again, hoping to pinpoint the source more precisely, but it never did. Instead, I discovered a hairline crack in the floor.

Maybe it was just an unusually large mole digging around under the house—that explanation seemed as good as any at the time.

I decided to call in a pest specialist in the morning. For now, a glass of whisky and a glance at the patient’s notebook seemed like a better plan.

It started off innocently enough. Just a few dozen addresses—presumably antiquarian bookstores the man had visited during his travels. Then things took a stranger turn.

Coordinates appeared.

Photos of strange constructions—small sheds or storage buildings standing in seemingly random places.

I stared at the photos for a long time. Something about them disturbed me. You didn’t need to be an architect to notice obvious structural defects—and these buildings had *plenty*.

Angles that defied logic. Walls that appeared simultaneously convex and concave. Windows placed in utterly nonsensical locations, some even fitted with handles on the *outside*.

And the locations themselves…

An abandoned factory on the edge of the city. A gravel island on a disused rail siding. One photo showed a shed crammed into the corner of an old courtyard like a forgotten outhouse in a Soviet housing block.

When I turned the next page, something inside me twisted.

I felt my stomach lurch upward violently—first dinner, then breakfast clawing their way back.

I jumped to my feet and rushed to the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet in time. The retching lasted for minutes, wracking my body like a curse.

When I was finally emptied of everything, I rinsed my mouth with ice-cold water, splashed my face, and on shaky legs returned to the notebook, which now lay open on the carpet beside the armchair.

Then I picked up my phone, dialed C., and told him to call the police.

By the time I reached the hospital, chaos had broken out.

C. stood by the wall, his face nearly the same color as the sickly white paint behind him. In a trembling voice, he told me that shortly after my call, an inhuman, animalistic scream of agony had erupted from the isolation room.

He had run there immediately, calling the police as I’d instructed.

What he found chilled him to the core.

A writhing, churning mass of bloated, pale-white maggots was tumbling from the bed onto the floor, spreading throughout the room like a tide of rot. He hadn’t dared to open the door—he waited for the patrol.

When they arrived, they brought in technicians and pest control.

When the door was finally opened, a wave of stench burst forth—decay, rot, death clinging to every surface.

They found our patient beneath the pile of larvae, his abdomen torn wide open.

I don’t know what compelled me, but I left the hospital, got into my car, and located the coordinates for one of those strange buildings. It was only a few blocks away, wedged between a crumbling tenement and an abandoned factory.

I drove there alone, in the dead of night, armed only with that damned notebook and a police-issue flashlight I always kept in the glove compartment.

When I saw it—

The wooden shack, wedged between brick and concrete like a splinter in diseased flesh—

I nearly vomited again.

The door, warped at an impossible angle, should not have moved—yet it opened beneath my hand.

Inside, the air reeked of the same scent I’d known from the isolation room: rot and mildew. But beneath it… something else.

If you’ve ever dug for worms in wet earth after a rainstorm, you’ll know the smell.

Freshly churned soil. The scent of the grave.

I leaned carefully over the pit and shone the flashlight down into the darkness.

A long beam of white light pierced the void—revealing nothing at first.

Then something moved.

And with a sickening blend of awe and horror, I realized I was watching the massive body of a giant worm slithering through an underground tunnel.

Then I remembered the rest of the notebook.

The photographs from deeper within—the ones taken by feeding a camera into those holes.

They showed people being devoured by great, pale, eyeless worms.

Worms the size of trains.

In one picture...

A girl, no more than six years old...

The man’s missing daughter...

Torn apart by a bloated, white larva deep beneath the earth.
