The first day of college is supposed to be exciting, maybe a bit nerve-wracking, but nothing could have prepared me for meeting my new roommate. As I pushed open the door to our shared dorm room, I was greeted by an unusual sense of calm. The air felt still, almost serene, as if the room itself welcomed me. My roommate was already there, sitting quietly on the edge of his bed, a slender figure engrossed in a thick, leather-bound book. His eyes, deep and thoughtful, briefly glanced up to meet mine.

"Hey," I said with a friendly smile. "I'm Alex."

He looked up slowly, his lips forming a small, polite smile. "Nice to meet you, Alex. I'm Neal."

There was something intriguing about Neal. He spoke softly, his words deliberate and measured. Despite his reserved demeanor, he had an aura of quiet confidence. As the days passed, I noticed Neal had peculiar habits. He enjoyed late-night reading sessions, often whispering passages from his books in languages I didn't recognize. He seemed to prefer solitude, spending hours writing in a journal or staring thoughtfully out the window.

College life was strange enough without a roommate who felt more like an enigma than a person, but Neal's presence was oddly comforting. He wasn't the typical social butterfly, but there was a certain depth to him that made me curious. As the weeks went by, I found myself wanting to learn more about my new roommate, and slowly, the line between acquaintance and friendship began to blur.

One evening, after an exhausting day of classes, I mentioned my plans to walk back from a friend’s apartment across town. Neal looked up from his book with an unusual intensity in his eyes.

"Take Elm Street instead," he said, his voice soft but insistent. "Avoid 174th Street. Accidents are pretty common nowadays."

I laughed it off, thinking he was just being cautious. "Thanks for the tip, Neal, but I'm sure I'll be fine."

His gaze didn't waver. "Trust me, Alex. Elm Street."

Curiosity piqued, I decided to heed his advice. As I walked along Elm Street, I couldn't shake the feeling that Neal knew something I didn't. The next day, the news reported a major accident on 174th Street. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized just how close I had come to being caught in it.

Incidents like these became more frequent. Neal would casually mention things that seemed trivial at first but later proved to be eerily accurate. Once, he warned me about an impending storm hours before any weather reports predicted it. Another time, he advised me to avoid a certain cafe, only for it to be shut down the next day due to a health violation. Despite these peculiarities, Neal remained calm and composed, never drawing attention to his uncanny predictions. Yet, the more I observed, the more I felt a growing sense of unease. There was something about Neal that defied explanation, something that hinted at a depth far beyond what he let on.

Late one night, unable to sleep, I decided to confront Neal about his unusual knowledge. I found him at his desk, scribbling in his journal.

"Neal," I began, trying to keep my voice steady, "you always seem to know things no one else does. It's uncanny."

He paused, his pen hovering over the page, and turned to face me with that familiar, enigmatic smile. "Just a knack for observation, I suppose."

His answer was as vague as ever. As the weeks went by, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was much more to Neal than met the eye. And as the line between uncanny valley and reality continued to blur, I found myself drawn deeper into the mystery that was my roommate.  

Classes were in full swing, and I found myself struggling to keep up. My grades were mediocre at best, and the late-night study sessions were taking their toll. My professors were demanding, the coursework relentless. Despite my efforts, I couldn't seem to pull my grades up beyond a C average. Neal, on the other hand, seemed to glide through his studies effortlessly, though he rarely spoke about his own classes or assignments. One night, as I was cramming for a particularly difficult exam, I caught something out of the corner of my eye. Neal was sitting at his desk, as usual, but his form seemed to flicker, just for a moment, as if he was there one second and gone the next. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, and chalked it up to exhaustion.

But it happened again a few nights later. This time, I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when I saw Neal's silhouette flicker in the moonlight. The shadows seemed to dance around him, distorting his figure. I sat up, heart pounding, but when I focused, he was just sitting there, reading his book, as if nothing had happened. The strange occurrences didn't stop there. Sometimes, when Neal walked past my laptop, the screen would flicker momentarily, static lines flashing across it. My phone would glitch out if he was too close, the screen freezing or apps crashing without explanation. Each time, Neal would glance at the device with mild interest before continuing with whatever he was doing.

I tried to convince myself it was all in my head—after all, lack of sleep and stress could do strange things to a person. My friends joked that I was turning into a paranoid insomniac, and I laughed along, but deep down, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something off about Neal.

Despite the oddities, Neal remained a calm and reassuring presence. He never seemed phased by my growing unease, and his cryptic smile never wavered. He continued to offer advice, small pieces of wisdom that always seemed to come at just the right moment, saving me from countless minor disasters. As the semester wore on, the boundary between exhaustion-induced hallucination and reality became increasingly blurred. The more I observed Neal, the more questions I had, and yet, the answers remained tantalizingly out of reach. I'll need to have a one-on-one conversation with him when I get some free time.

One afternoon, I returned from a particularly grueling class to find Neal's door ajar. Normally, his door was always closed, sealed shut as if guarding some precious secret. But today, it was open, and Neal was nowhere in sight. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to take a peek inside. The first thing that struck me was how surprisingly normal the room looked at first glance. Posters of various anime characters adorned the walls, a stark contrast to Neal's otherwise enigmatic persona. I couldn't help but chuckle at the sight—it was such a mundane, almost endearing detail.

But as I stepped further inside, my attention was drawn to his desk. There, among the clutter of books and papers, lay the thick, leather-bound journal that Neal was always writing in. The journal was open, and beside it were several ancient-looking artifacts, each more bizarre than the last. One was a small, intricately carved idol, its features shifting and warping as I approached, as if the space around it was alive. Heart pounding, I leaned over the journal. Most of the writing was illegible, a series of strange symbols and glyphs that seemed to dance on the page. But two words stood out, clear as day, almost glowing against the backdrop of the arcane script: "Nyarlathotep's Offspring."

A chill ran down my spine as I read the words again, trying to make sense of it. The name resonated with an eerie familiarity, as if it held some ancient, cosmic significance. I had never seen it before, yet it felt as if it was etched into the very fabric of my mind. Just then, I heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Panicking, I quickly backed out of Neal's room, closing the door as quietly as I could. I barely had time to compose myself before Neal entered the dorm, his presence as calm and composed as ever.

"Hey, Alex," he greeted me with that familiar, enigmatic smile. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

I forced a laugh, trying to steady my nerves. "Just tired from all the studying, I guess."

Neal nodded, his dark eyes briefly flickering with an emotion I couldn't quite place. "Remember to take breaks. Overworking yourself can lead to... unexpected consequences."

As he spoke, I couldn't help but steal a glance at his door, now firmly shut once again. 

“Fuck, why did I shut the door, he knew it was open” I told myself deep within my mind.

The artifacts, the journal, the name—they all swirled in my mind, creating a whirlpool of questions and suspicions. I knew I had to find a way to talk to Neal one-on-one, to confront him about what I had seen and the growing sense of unease that gnawed at me. But for now, I had to play it cool, pretending that everything was normal, even as the suspicion of my roommate deepened with every passing day.

The next day, after a long day of classes, Neal and I returned to our dorm room. I tried to push the events of yesterday out of my mind, but the memory of what I had seen in Neal's room lingered like a shadow.

As we stepped inside, Neal turned to me, his expression unreadable. "Alex," he said, his voice low and serious, "we need to talk."

My heart skipped a beat. I knew this confrontation was coming, but I still wasn't prepared for it. "About what?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

"You were in my room yesterday," Neal said bluntly, his gaze piercing. "You had no right to go through my things."

I bristled at his accusation. "I wasn't snooping, Neal. I was just... curious. You've been acting strangely lately, and I wanted to know why."

Neal's eyes narrowed, a flicker of something dark passing over his features. "Curiosity killed the cat, Alex. Some things are better left unknown."

"But you can't deny that you do some pretty weird cryptid shit," I blurted out, frustration bubbling to the surface. "I've been trying to ignore it, but it's been stressing me out for weeks at this point. I deserve to know what's going on."

Neal remained silent for a moment, his gaze intense. Then, with a sigh, he shook his head. "You have no proof of anything, Alex. Just wild theories and baseless accusations."

Frustration turned to desperation, and before I could stop myself, I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out a small Nerf gun. I pointed it at Neal, my hand trembling.

"And what would this do to change your mind?" Neal asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I hesitated, the weight of the situation crashing down on me. But something inside me urged me forward, pushed me to take a stand. With a shaky breath, I pulled the trigger.

The foam dart flew through the air, missing Neal entirely. But as it sailed past him, I heard a sickening sound—a wet, flesh-like slap that sent chills down my spine. Neal's eyes widened in mild amusement, and he turned to see what I had hit. And that's when I saw it—a writhing, invisible limb, pulsating with a sickly red hue, lurking just behind Neal. For a moment, there was silence, broken only by the sound of my racing heartbeat. Then, with a disappointed sigh, Neal turned back to me, his expression unreadable.

"We'll talk," he said, his voice heavy with resignation. "But not here."

And with that, he swept out of the room, leaving me standing there, my mind reeling with the implications of what I had just witnessed. As the door swung shut behind him, I couldn't help but feel that I had just opened a door to a world far darker and more dangerous than I could have ever imagined.
