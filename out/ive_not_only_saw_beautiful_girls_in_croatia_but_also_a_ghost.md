Sorry for this title but this are the only things i remember from those vacations. 

it's not super creepy but it's still great i think.

I was 15 at the time and a childhood friend of mine had invited me and all my family to his grandmother's house in croatia (his mother was also croatian, the rest of us were french).  He was my best friend and our respectiv family were close friends too because of us. 

So, for the summer holidays he and his family invited us all to the croatian (who spoke french) grandmother's house and as well youth house from my friend's mother.

It was fantastic vacations in a strange isolated house which was on a small island. This house was strange because it was strangely made and not finished; in fact it was the father-in-law of my friend's mother who made the house by himself, but died a long time ago before to finish it (because of a machine-tool accident). So the house was handmade and not finished.

There was the right wing, which was essentialy a long corridor leading to bedrooms, toilets and bathroom everybody was sleeping here except my friend and me. There was the left wing which was a 2 small levels, the living room where my friend and me were sleeping and the kitchen who was just on a higher ground. This kitchen was leading by a door and small stair to the central area in below which was a huge hall and served as entrance and dining room. This room had only a protective canvas as rooftop.

We were living in this house with the grandmother too which was funny and full of life. But i did'nt felt well in this house. there was noises everywhere, like scratching on the floor, noise of moving things anf rummage noises. but because the house was not finished, i still think that it was wind and outdoor noises that coming from everywhere indoor. But i'm still worry w ith rummage noises.

So whatever, at the end of the vacacions, during the night i had a urge to go pissing. i had to go in the kitchen then go in the diningroom/entrance to access to the corridor door at the other side  where there was the toilets. So i get up and when i passed the kitchen door to enter the dining room i saw below the stairs at the side of the dining table a elder figure who was sipping tea/coffee. I said to myself "who the fuck is sipping tea at like 2am". but i was i little chilled because the figure didn't even clinch at me and i couldn't reconize her. the moon was bright enough so that i could see the figure but not enough to see color and who it was. Because of the little croocked stature i though it was the grandma, but she was taller than usually. i said "bonjour" before go down the stairs... no answer... ok whatever. 

I did go down the stairs to reach the corridor door which was at 1,50m from the "grandma" that i wasn't taking my eyes off and was still sipping without aknowledging me.

when i reached the door and put my and on the handle; the figure disapeared.

i stayed freezed with a bug in my mind for few seconds before a fucking chill in my back (that i still feel when i'm writing this sentence) made me realize that what i did just saw was not normal. i've run back to the living room where my firend was still sleeping and i got into my bed terrorized and goes to looking all night long the stairs that was leading to the kitchen (then kitchen to the diningroom where i saw the "grandma").

the next day i told everything to my friend who made fun of me.

not end of the story

few years later, in france this time, i was dining with my friend's family, we were talking and the mother started to talk about her youth, her relationship with her mother and father in law in croatia. this is the moment i learnt that he died violently with a tool. She was in her teenage when he died. And without any warning she started to tell us that after his death she was still feeling him and seeing him (i don't remember since how long it have been going on). She told us that after some times of torments, beleiving she was going crazy and feeling watched, his father-in-law ghost came to her and for the first time said something : "now, i leave you alone". it was the last time she saw him. My friend and me had our mind blown.

after this story i asked if he talked to his mother of what i saw few years before, He swear he didn't. the only reason i have to beleive him is that i trust him and his mother.

it's been more than 10years since that happened and i'm still blown. I don't want to beleive, and it's a strange feeling. i'm not supertitious but i'm christian, i do have reasons to beleive in god, here only my eyes are my reasons and i can't trust my eyes; but when you saw something, when you are sure to have seen something, it is hard to deny it. I don't beleive but still can't find an  explanation which fill the clarity of what i saw.

People tell me that it could be the slumber and/or the moonlight/shadow that made me thinking i was seeing someone. But still; I know i saw someone sipping a fucking tea in the middle of the night.
