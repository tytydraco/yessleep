I went back to my original post (archived) and it's from two years ago. This isn't possible, It's only been two months.

Two months ago, I told you all about how we were trapped. It was a time loop, and the commentors were really useful. We did manage to get me and someone else outside the classroom, but what happened was weird. I typed a draft a long time ago, but never got it published. I still have the text from those months ago. Here it is:

So, it took a few tries, but me and Jerry managed to slip out of the door. We had brought our water bottles and phones so that we could call each other. By the way, we did some experiments, and while we can't call for outside help, we have been able to call and text each other. The second we got out the door, I immediately knew something was wrong. First thing we did once outside was try to open the door. It didn't budge, which we presume means it only can be opened unconsciously by Mr. Johnson at the beginning of a new iteration. The next thing we decided to do was leave the building and see if we were still affected by the resetting. If not, we would all be able to escape in small groups. However, when I turned to leave, my heart sunk, and that little successful feeling was instantly turned to dread.  
  
Now, in my school, we have clear glass exits at the end of every hallway. The classroom that we're in is right on the edge, so the exit should be right there. However, instead of the exit, we were instead presented with a long corridor, proceeding a few doors down before turning left. We proceeded down the hall, the class on the phone with us the whole time. As we walked further and further, the lights started to flicker. We found a couple other classrooms with nobody in them. Eventually, we came across the dining hall. We got really excited, as the dining hall normally includes an outdoor eating area, meaning we could possibly leave the building. We ran over to where the exit should have been, but sure enough, it was just a wall.  
  
What was even more strange, however, was the state of the cafeteria. Normally, we have lunch during 4th period, but there wasn't a single food tray. In fact, we didn't seen a single trace of other human beings the whole time we were out there. The kitchen was nearby, and did include some food. Anyway, I guess we lost track of time, because a little while later as we were exploring, it reset we suddenly found ourselves back in our seats in the classroom.  
  
As we were explaining what happened, a few of the other kids told us to look out the window. Normally, that window would face a forest next to our school, with a road in the middle. It still did, but it was dark outside. REALLY dark. This was odd, as we've been keeping track of time and know for sure that it should've been daytime. Whatever it is, we can't access this area, as all attempts at opening or breaking through the window have failed.  
  
So yeah, we're still in here. We've seen a couple suggestions on the previous post that we tried out. We tried writing stuff down on the whiteboard, but it just resets, as does any attempts at taking notes. The only possible method of typing or writing something and keeping it between iterations is to post it here. I really don't understand, I guess if it's online, then it's not technically in here, and bypasses the loop? Who knows with these types of situations. Someone suggested holding onto Mr. Johnson as we were resetting. We tried that as well, but we all get teleported back to our seats. Several groups have been sent out of the classroom at the start of various iterations, and not one of them has been able to find an exit. We've tried busting down the door, but it appears indestructible. I remember once, like 7 of us got together and threw a large table at the door. That door literally did not have a single scratch on it after that. Additionally, none of us have had any problems from the sleep deprivation or hunger, so that's good, I guess. I can't explain this, I guess when the class resets, our biological needs reset as well? I suppose we'll just see how it goes and hope we get out.  
  
UPDATE 1: A kid got crushed in the door today. I guess he was just a little bit too slow getting out. It killed him almost instantly, not that it affected future iterations. I never really fully stopped to comprehend this, but when we die, we get brought back to life in the next iteration. I have even had a couple of deaths myself, once during that riot early on, again in a recent incident where a kid got frustrated with the failed escape attempts and went crazy with some scissors. And yet at the beginning of every iteration, we all are back sitting at our table groups without a scratch on us. I am an immortal. We all are. Which I guess means if we don’t get out, we’ll simply spend all of eternity in here. The very idea has us stressed beyond belief.  
  
Let me go into more detail about that previous story.  
  
It was the beginning of the next iteration, when this random classmate I didn't know very well started screaming. He grabbed the scissors out of a drawer and stabbed Jerry in the chest. He was stabbing people left and right while screaming about how we're never gonna get out, and how this must be some kind of punishment. It was at that point that I got killed, so I wasn't there for the rest of the story. Apparently, Mr. Johnson and 3 other kids were able to get the scissors from him and knocked him unconscious. On the next iteration, we were back to normal and restrained him.  
  
UPDATE 2: The lights went out all of a sudden. It was only for about 2 minutes, but it was strange. It was pitch black, but most of us had our phone lights. During this time, everything seemed louder. Like, you know when you're watching a video and you turn the volume up? It was like that but in real life. The lights came back on just as suddenly as they went off, and everything went back to normal.  
  
UPDATE 3: You know, there was a comment on my previous post talking about how the same thing might be happening to the whole school, because it was strange that nobody is outside waiting for us. Personally I think the results of our escape attempt proved that something else is happening. Some of the other kids even believe that we're in another dimension. Personally, I think that explains a lot.  
  
The hallways are changing about every few iterations. It's becoming more and more odd. Everything resets at the end of an iteration, which means we are immortal, as anybody in this classroom can die and then be reset. Oh god. Are we going to spend eternity trapped in here? Clawing at the doors and throwing tables at windows? Sending people out into empty corridors to look for an exit that probably doesn't exist? And now here I'm sitting, a freaking Reddit post being the only connection with the outside world. Things are bad when even death isn't an escape.  
  
There's no escape...  
  
And there probably never will be...  
  
God help us...  
  
its been so long since we last left. Is the world even there? Is it just a myth?  
  
Maybe…  
  
Maybe . . .  
  
Feb 28, 2023. We are here. We still haven’t left. WHEN WILL THIS END????  
  
Update 5: The hallways are getting weird. Extending way beyond where this building of the school should end, and with rooms that shouldn't be here. I'm talking rooms from other buildings, like bedrooms, kitchens, stores, hotel rooms, even a large warehouse. Still keeps shapeshifting, it's a mystery for sure.  
  
Update 6: I've been trying to stay calm, and sane, but it's getting more and more difficult by the day. The lights went out again, pitch black. All the sounds in the room were still amplified, but I heard something. Breathing. You could say it was just my peers, but it just sounded wrong. In addition to the breathing I could hear unintelligible whispers. Suddenly, I heard the loud screams of my peers and Mr. Johnson, as I felt their blood hit my face and body. I was lifted up by the head and leg, and felt myself get torn in half. Suddenly, I was at the beginning of the next iteration, like normal. Something killed us all while the lights were off, and we simply woke up here again.  
  
Update 7: One of my peers just disappeared. I didn’t even notice him gone, he disappeared right after the incident in the dark. I don’t know where he went, or what happened. I looked out the window and tried to break it, but still nothing. It looks as though it was nighttime out there, but there aren’t any stars or clouds or a moon, just trees, a road, and a pitch black sky.  
  
Update 8: HOLY HELL. I looked out the window again and there he was. The missing kid. He had pitch black eyes and his mouth was open and bleeding. He stood there until it reset. I heard him scream as it all reset, and he was gone. I don’t know why this is happening or what happened to him, I just really want to get out of this. Most of us have family, friends, pets, siblings, parents, and we might never see them again.

  
Update 9: There was another darkness, and we were all killed by that thing again. Another kid is gone, and we can see the two both outside the window.  
  
Their mouths are still open, and their eyes are black and bleeding. They have blood stained clothes that dripped down, and various lacerations just everywhere on their body. They were blinking in strange patterns.

Morse code.

I marked the pattern and used an online chart to translate. I suppose what they were telling us was wat we already suspected, but I take this as confirmation.
