I grew up in a small town where you could drive the same road every day and swear it would never end. We called it the Never Mile. No one ever agreed where it began or ended. On the county maps, it's just a faded grey line: a perfect ruler stroke in the middle of nowhere.

When I was a kid, my dad told me never to follow it at night. He said, "It doesn't like being looked at after dark." Not people. Not drivers. It.

Last week, I had to deliver some totes to a man outside of town. Local delivery work. Easy money.

I picked them up from a rough-looking guy at a gas station around eleven. After that, I planned to head home, crack a beer, and game for the rest of the day. The job paid three grand, so I stocked up on beer and snacks. Enough to hole up for days.

The address was seven miles away. Thirty minutes according to Waze. I saw the green route line stretch right over the Never Mile's faded grey, and my dad's warning flashed in my head. But it was still before noon. I'd be home by one.

I turned onto the Never Mile with music blasting. Pavement. Trees. A distant farmhouse. A billboard. Fresh double yellow lines. No sidewalk, just a dirt path on the shoulder. The sun straight in my eyes.

Right as I nailed the chorus to Feeling This, "Fate fell short this time, your smile fades in the summer", the music cut out. My phone still showed it was playing, but there was no sound. The tires hummed louder. The air felt heavier, like a storm was coming, though the forecast was clear.

I think I knew then.

The pavement looked new, but it had no smell. The farmhouse never got closer. The same billboard rolled past again and again.

I'd been driving ten minutes.

It was a cracked, faded ad for a diner that closed decades ago. I knew because the owner died when I was in middle school. I checked the rear-view. The same billboard was behind me. Same missing corner, same graffiti over "TASTY CREAMPIES." Same trees beyond it both ahead and behind me.

The car smelled like wet earth. Freshly dug.

I kept going. Twenty miles. Thirty. The sun didn't move.

I saw a barefoot man walking the opposite way, head down. Ten minutes later, I saw him again. Same pace, same clothes, only this time, he passed me. I never slowed. His lips were moving, but I couldn't hear the words.

By mile fifty, I stopped checking Waze. It still said I was one mile away.

I turned around. In the distance, another car turned too, facing me in the opposite lane, maybe thirty feet ahead.

The driver was me.

Same clothes. Same hat. Same scab from shaving that morning. I didn't feel my foot press the gas, but the car moved forward. So did he. His eyes stayed on the road, his lips moving like the barefoot man's.

I rolled my window down as we passed each other.

He was saying my name. Our name? Over and over.

I hit the brakes. The rear-view mirror showed nothing but empty road. The smell of wet earth filled my lungs.

Ahead, the road shimmered. Not heat... more like a film reel stuttering. I stepped out.

The asphalt was soft. Cold.

I took off my shoes and started walking the other way.
