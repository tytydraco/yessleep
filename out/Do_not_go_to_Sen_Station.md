Up in central Pennsylvania, a little ways east of State College, is an old railroad station in the town of Sen. Do not, under any circumstances, go there. 

Railroad station is a little bit generous. It is an ancient, rotting shack next to the tracks with a trash heap 30 feet off in the woods.

I had seen people talking about it on the internet. Urban explorers, mostly, although it could hardly be classified as urban. The town of Sen didn't even exist, really, it was a post office and a grocery store and 13 houses within the mile radius of the town. It was one of those places you go to go somewhere else.

At first, I had no intention of going. Sen Station wasn't haunted. There were no ghosts. No mysteries. Just an old, rotting train station from Pennsylvania's glory days.

But me and my dad were already heading up there for college tours anyways, Penn State was my top choice and my dad was an Alumni. We had the hotel for four nights, and the tour wasn't until Monday.

He had left early Saturday morning with a friend for Pittsburg, so I was left in the hotel with the car. Somewhere, in my underdeveloped mind, I decided to go check the place out. I had nothing better to do, and I was always the outdoorsy type. Even if there was nothing interesting, it would still be a walk in the woods. 

The internet's accounts were all strangely stilted. Not like they were gatekeeping and just didn't want to talk about it, but like they didn't know what to say. The general consensus was not to go. That, as one strange user wrote, it would reach inside and twist you and leave you spinning for the rest of your life. 

The drive was only about an hour and a half. Towards the end, I was speeding down the empty two lane roads, watching the trees go past in a blur. They were just starting to turn brown, their edges tinged a rich copper. 

It was really hard to find. I parked my car in the back of the grocery store parking lot and started walking along Laurel St., towards the general location I found on Google Maps. 

All the trees looked the same. There was no obvious path like you would expect from a train station. Even though it was basically just a rest stop, a piss and stretch your legs kinda place, there still would've needed to be maintenance crews and stuff. 

Eventually, I decided to screw it and just head into the forest. Once I was in there, it wasn't very hard to find. There was a sign peeking through the trees, and the tracks cut visibly through the underbrush. Sen Station, in all of its glory. 

It proved, as expected, to just be dilapidated tracks next to a wooden hut. Tracks weren't interesting, and the shack was full of nothing but a mummified squirrel and old railroad ties.

I pushed the door open with mild disappointment. I concluded that the people on the internet were just hiding their smoke spot, which was kinda cool if you squinted, and resolved to head back. It wasn't even 11 yet, so I could have all day to fuck around back at the hotel.

As I walked back towards the road, I suddenly remembered to go check out the trash pile they had talked about. There would probably be something interesting, maybe an old coke bottle or some coins. Something that would make it worthwhile.

So I turned to trek the other way, back past the shack and the sign, and towards the small clearing I had faintly glimpsed earlier. 

And, almost disappointingly, it was just trash. Cool vintage trash, but still trash. With a sigh, I crouched down to start searching through it.

All in all, I got a pretty good haul. A couple old bottles, a pocketful of bottle caps, and an old pair of glasses. I was just standing back up when I felt the pile shift under me.

I panicked, thinking I had ruined the structural stability of the heap and would fall into the pile of broken glass and tetanus, but after a few seconds of breathlessness I was able to ease myself back to the ground. 

Curiously, I grabbed a small rock and threw that at the pile. It shifted, paused, then shifted again. I threw another one. The trash was starting to expand and contract rhythmically, like a bear waking up from hibernation. It rumbled and clanked and I felt the air change imperceptibly, the way you know when someone has walked into a room except I was alone with this *thing*.

I was frozen in my spot, mindlessly watching the heap of junk shudder. There was this liquid oozing from it, a rusty brown translucent oil that seeped from the cracks and ran down the sides. 

The cold feeling of dread settled in my stomach. I felt my gut clench, like I had stumbled upon something I was never meant to see. It yawned and groaned and shuddered in the autumn wind.

On weak legs, I managed to find my way back to the shack. It's decaying form was a godsend. I sat down on the stairs, keeping my eyes trained on the thing in the distance. It's clanks echoed through the trees like a bird song.

I don't know why I felt the need to watch it. I had watched over my shoulder the entire time I was walking away. It wasn't moving, I doubted it even could move, but the most primitive parts of my brain were screaming at me to keep my eyes on it.

The bottle caps in my pocket jangled. I had left everything else by the pile, but the caps had been forgotten.

They kept on jangling. My hand felt like lead as I reached to grab them. They were like baby crabs, wriggly and writhing in my palm. 

I don't know how, but they clung to me when I tried to drop them. The ridges of the caps pinched my skin as they held on, the metal twisting and writhing. I shook my arm, but they just used the momentum to start climbing.

I used my other hand to start ripping them off of me. One by one, I grabbed and twisted and threw them to the ground. Once they were on the ground they started running back towards the trash heap, but each one took a chunk of my skin with it.

By the time they were all off me, my arm was covered in cuts and the red, oily liquid from the pile. I watched as they scurried back to the pile, using their ridges like centipedes.

After awhile, the clanking eased. The rumbling subsided and I was left in the silent forest. Nothing else was making a sound. I don't know if everything ran away, or if they all instinctively knew to be quiet, to hide.

The sun was high in the sky before I made my way back to the road. My hands and arm were still covered in the greasy liquid, it clung to my skin and soaked in. I made each step carefully, placing my feet on the softest patches of ferns and moss. I felt the heavy certainty that if I made a sound, if I caused a disturbance, it would wake up again.

Even after I made it to the road, the dread still hung on to my mind. I was running the whole way back, my mind replaying the path over and over again.

My car door opened with a click, the oily liquid leaving a residue on the handle. It soaked into the steering wheel and the seatbelt like a plague.

Relief was short lived. Maybe ten minutes into the drive, I felt the steering wheel shudder. I froze, almost driving myself into a tree before I got a grip. It tensed when I grabbed it, flinching as I turned to get myself back into the lane.

My sole focus was getting back to the hotel. As the steering wheel continued to protest, and the seatbelt constricted against my stomach, and the seat started to breathe underneath of me, I kept my eyes on the road.

By the 45 minute mark my car had a heartbeat. I felt it in the seat, in the steering wheel, it echoed through the cabin like the drums of hell. Ba-dump. Ba-dump. The air in the car ebbed and flowed with breath, the oily substance secreting from the leather and the dashboard and the air vents.

My brain was screaming at me, yelling and beating my head to *get out*. My only thoughts were plans on how to break out of the car if it kept it's door closed, if it pressed up its windows. 

Sen Station was the Devil's own Garden of Eden, and I had inadvertently brought His creation out into the world. It was breathing, and beating, and *being* around me in a way that metal and plastic should not.

The second I saw the first buildings in State College, I turned off the road and drove into a patch of trees. The car flinched and shuddered as I rammed it through the branches. When I went to grab the keys, they released with a faint squelch. The door opened like a mouth, the red oily substance lining the frame. The seatbelt retracted back into the car with a hiss of pain, making the whole thing flinch again.

I chucked the keys as far into the woods as I could. The car continued to shudder and groan behind be, the door shutting itself with a burst of uncomfortably warm air. 

I ran the whole way back to the hotel. There were people around, so the animal parts of my brain protested less at my noise. 

The first thing I did was wash my hands and arms with all the soap in the room. It's off of me, but now it’s just flowing down the pipes into the sewers. I can see it in my head, the pipes starting to flex and squeeze.

I called my dad but he didn't pick up. I called my mom, and she's already on her way with her car, but I don't know what I'm going to tell them. 

Nobody is going to believe me. I'm spinning and spinning and spinning. I'm writing this because I need to get it out, I need to tell anyone, but I don't even know what I'm telling. Do not go to Sen Station. There is nothing there for you.
