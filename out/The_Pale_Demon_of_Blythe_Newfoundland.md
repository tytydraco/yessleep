How long would the church hold?

I asked myself that question dozens of times, day in and day out since Father Westwood departed. I became a recluse, barely leaving the church at all in the few weeks since. The church doors were chained from the inside and what few visitors still cared to visit were turned away. Frankly, I didn’t know what else to do. 

On one of the few occasions I did leave the church for food and other essentials, I became painfully aware of the cost of my isolation. As I walked through the quiet streets of Blythe, I could feel eyes staring daggers into me. It happened when I was tracking through the snow back to the church, hauling a heavy bag of groceries, and trying my best to follow my previous steps. 

“Preacher!” I heard a voice behind me yell.

I immediately recognized it and almost dropped the bag as I hurriedly shuffled through the snow. They were getting closer behind me, a group maybe three or four strong, shouting and throwing rocks and snow. When I reached the church's steps, I finally turned around to confirm who my pursuers were. Gregory stood there, snarling at me with a small mob at his heels. He was no longer a lone actor; he had a whole troupe playing to his tune.

Not that it mattered. I doubted I would live long enough to see their act anyway.

The night after Father Westwood departed, I awoke to cold air brushing against my skin. I was halfway through opening the front door of the church. After this, I got the chain, but I wasn’t as scared as much was confused that night. The weight of my actions was not fully apparent to my dreary and sleep-deprived mind.

I would turn and start closing the door when I heard galloping crashing through the trees. Heavy footsteps as something barreled towards the church. I slammed the door shut and braced my entire weight behind it.

*BOOM*.

Something immensely heavy crashed into the door. I stumbled back and stared, half expecting something to have broken through. Frantic scratching traced the outline of the door and what sounded like dozens of fists banged against the door like thunder. 

“Go away!” I shouted, my voice sounding weak.

There was no response.

I fumbled around for my crucifix and shoved it towards the door. In my hands, it felt small but it filled my veins with the smallest amount of courage.

“I said… GO AWAY!”

*BOOM.* 

*BOOM.*

Two more heavy blows crashed against the church door. A high-pitched squeal mixed with a roar pierced the air. I dropped the crucifix and covered my ears. I stumbled back and slid down the wall, it felt like my ears were bleeding. Minutes ticked by before the banging stopped. When I uncovered my ears, it was eerily silent.

Needless to say, I didn’t sleep again that night. However, three things became painfully apparent after that night: The need for a chain to keep me inside and IT outside. As long as I stayed inside the church it couldn’t reach me. And if I wanted any hope of surviving another day, I needed help outside the Vatican.

Clifford White was, at first, not what I thought my ‘help’ would be. I found him after several increasingly desperate days of searching online. He was a healer or shaman (or a medicine man?) of a First Nation community in Nova Scotia. The first few times I contacted him, I was met with swift rejections and hang-ups. I don’t know what finally swayed him but after a few days of pestering, he finally acquiesced and booked a ferry to Newfoundland.

Call it heretical if you wish. Unfaithful, betrayal, sacrilege even. Inviting not just a heathen but a shaman into the house of God for help? If the Vatican found out I would surely be excommunicated. But I was desperate and the words of Father Westwood were ringing in my ears. The land has history, and if I wanted any chance of vanquishing this foul beast then I *needed* someone who knew the land. 

When Clifford arrived, it became clear almost immediately that he wasn’t helping out of the goodness of his heart. He had this arrogant smirk when he shook my hand. The bastard probably thought this was his chance to pull one over on the white man and his god. I didn’t care, I just wanted out of this.

“You know, my people didn’t believe the spirits should be trapped in a place like this,” he said, staring up at the high ceiling. 

He was the first person I had welcomed into the church in weeks and it was fair to say he wasn’t impressed with either the building or the state it was in.

“God isn’t trapped in here,” I retorted, leading him to one of the pews.

I will give Clifford credit however, when we started talking business the smirk was gone, replaced by a grim determination. When I finished explaining everything to him, he sat back in the pew and scratched his chin. 

“What do you know about this land?” He asked.

“Not much frankly, just what’s on the tourism brochure. There was an old church and some Viking landings nearby, the rest…” I threw my hands up.

Clifford took a long while and mulled over his next words before speaking again. 

“There is a reason why not many know,” he started, “because everyone who would know is dead.”

My heart sank slightly, that hopeless feeling returning in my stomach.

“So that’s it?” I asked.

“Let me finish,” Clifford said, “the people who lived here all died when their village burned down generations ago. Lucky for you, my great-grandmother was of that tribe and was married off before the fire.”

Clifford continued but I will paraphrase what he said. His great-grandmother would marry into a tribe in Nova Scotia as part of a short-lived alliance inadvertently saving her from the fate of the rest of her people. She would raise her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren on the legends and myths of her people although because their tribe didn’t have a connection to the land, many of these were forgotten. 

“Over time these stories faded into nothing, but the land remembers. Thousands of years of history are soaked into the earth and are not as easily forgotten. Remnants of cultures and people are now long lost to time,” Clifford said.

This was something I had rarely thought about but it was painfully clear to anyone who looked into it. My family roots trace back to the Basque Country, however, very little of that heritage remains. Our tales and stories are forgotten over generations until there’s nothing left.

There was one story that Clifford said would not be so easily forgotten. It happened centuries before his great-grandmother was born and the way she talked about it didn’t make it sound like a story, but a warning.  When the Vikings landed, they disturbed the spirits, enraged them even. Clifford was put to sleep with stories of one in particular, one that would whisk him into the ocean or burn him to a crisp if he even dared to step out of line. 

The Pale Demon. 

Clifford took a steadying breath after saying its name. It was bad luck to say a spirit’s name. Strangely, it made me feel more confident. If it could be named then it was real. More real than what I’d been dealing with at least. It was still shrouded in myth and legend but it was a start. 

“I believe this is what you are dealing with,” Clifford said.

“Are you certain?” I asked.

“Are you going to question me?” 

I opened my mouth to contest but I closed it without saying anything. 

“That’s what I thought,” he snapped, “Now, my great-grandmother’s stories always ended with a great warrior sealing away the creature. It’s the only way they stopped it from razing the entire island.”

“So… what does that mean for us?” I asked.

“We have to seal it.”

“How do we do that?”

“How am I supposed to know?” Clifford asked.

“You’re the expert!”

“Yes, but these aren’t my stories, my history, they’re my great-grandmothers.”

We sat in silence after that, both of us lost deep in thought. A minute or so passed before a horrifying realization slowly took hold of me. With shaky legs, I stood up and walked to the front door.

“Where are you going?” Clifford asked.

I didn’t answer him. Under the several inches of snow, it was difficult to find but when my toes crashed against cold metal I knew I had found it. The cellar door.

Clifford followed me outside and his gaze went from the door to me, and back to the door. I could see the realization slowly hit him and his mouth fell open.

I had never touched the cellar. Most of it wasn’t even under the church and the door was sort of hidden under brush most of the time. I was an idiot. The old church, the fire, the priest, everything. 

Was this what started everything? Did Johnathan break whatever seal was on the cellar? No, this wasn’t Johnathan’s fault, this was mine. I wanted the church atop the old one, I didn’t listen to Johnathan’s cries for help, I neglected warning signs and red flags alike. 

With sweaty hands, I reached for the handle and hesitated for a moment after gripping it. What if there was something more down there? I pushed down my fears. I needed answers. The heavy metal door groaned and complained as it opened. It eventually reached a point where I could let it go and let it crash into the ground with a muted thud. 

My fears were immediately confirmed. On the back side of the cellar door were thousands of deep, jagged scratches, like a rabid animal was scratching its way out. I felt nauseous. 

Past the opening, I could see the black expanse of the cellar stretch out before me and disappear. I had all the answers I needed; I was not going down there. We shut the cellar door and went back to the church.

To say I was fully defeated would be an understatement. I unleashed this…beast, got multiple people killed, and now put the entire island at risk. Who knows if it would even stop with just the island? It was so overwhelming that I just felt numb to the whole thing. 

“We can try and slow it down,” Clifford suggested, “give us time to figure out how to trap it.”

I didn’t answer, just swayed slightly in my pew. 

“Did you hear me?” He asked, bumping my shoulder.

“I should just get this done and over with,” I muttered.

“That would slow it down.”

“Mmmmm.”

Clifford stood up and paced near the altar, Spots chasing him meowing for attention.

“I can’t do this,” I said, a tear rolling down my cheek.

I wasn’t even conscious of the workings of my body. 

“Hey,” Clifford snapped in my face, “don’t be a coward.”

I slowly looked up at him, “there’s nothing I can do.”

“For fuck’s sake pull yourself together, we just need to trap the bastard.”

Clifford came up with a plan. The Pale Demon was targeting me, that much we knew for sure. If we could lure him back to the cellar, we could, in theory, lock him down there again. It wouldn’t work for long, whatever runes or sigils or blessings needed would be missing but we could at least physically cage it. It wasn’t perfect, but it was the only thing Clifford came up with and I was in no state to add or brainstorm my own.

With the sun on our backs, we tried our best to make the plan work. While I prayed, Clifford chanted and burned bundles of sage and other herbs in a semi-circle around me to funnel the spirit down one path. Getting the demon into the cellar would be the largest problem. 

Clifford came up with a solution after several minutes of thought. I would stand next to the hatch, and after the spirit showed itself, he would get behind it, using the same herbs and chants that restricted its avenues of approach, and push it towards the opening. In hindsight, it was a stupid and dangerous plan, but we were desperate. There was no telling when the demon would strike again.

That night our plan was put to the test. My legs were shaking from both the nerves and cold. I silently whispered a prayer on the rosary while Clifford chanted and occasionally clapped while he walked around me. Despite my whispers and Clifford’s chanting, the night felt eerily quiet. 

The trees overhead rustled in the soft breeze, snow powder tumbling from the rocking branches. The snow made the pitch black of the starless overcast sky slightly more bearable. I could see several feet past the closest trees in any direction. Every groan of a tree or breaking of a twig snapped our attention toward it like deer during hunting season. Minutes ticked by. Minutes turned into what was likely an hour past sunset when Clifford turned to me.

He opened his mouth to say something. It was then we heard it.

What I originally thought was wind suddenly became something else. A ragged, flemy inhale of air. A wheezing, crackling exhale. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I scanned the woods for any sign of movement.

Something massive moved in the trees to our right. I stopped praying and instinctively took a step back. Clifford stopped chanting and oppositely took a step forward. It was impossible to tell what it was. It was like a tree walking around us. In the slivers between trunks, we could see the white snow before a black mass moved past.

An inhuman voice that was all too familiar to me rode on the wind, “V-Vaelk…kkk-om-nnnn”

It circled us. Heavy footfalls and the groaning of trees our only hints of its true whereabouts.

Clifford shouted something in his native language. I couldn’t translate it even if I could have spelled what he said. 

The movement stopped after it did a full circle. Then, slowly, it stepped forward. The trees bent out of their way as it came closer and closer. My heart was beating in my ears and adrenaline flowed through my veins.

I saw it.

Between the trunks of two large trees, a blank, rectangular wooden mask peered out. It was void of anything except two empty black sockets which oozed a black mucus. A spindly, long neck protruded from the back of the mask, large bones pressing against its taut, pale skin. 

Another heavy footfall and more of it came into focus. Sickly, pale skin threatening to rip with even the slightest pull covered its body in a cross of scar tissue and burns. It was too gaunt and frail to have bones, at least, that’s what I thought at first. Its ribs had been pulled back through its body. Each long, dirty rib bone, some cracked or broken, now pierced through its back like some macabre pair of wings.  

A long, spindly arm reached out from the other side of the tree. It was vaguely human, but it was stretched and wrong. Seven long and crooked, broken fingers splayed out toward me, each tipped with sharp, yellowing nails.

My heart felt as if it was about to burst in my chest as it drew closer. Tears rolled down my cheeks. The fingers got to within a meter of me before they stopped. The Pale Demon paused for nearly a full minute before it slowly withdrew its hand back toward the trees. 

Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see Clifford staring at the beast. His mouth agape as the bundle of sage in his hand tumbled to the ground. I didn’t dare take my eyes off the demon, fearing that when I looked back I would be greeted by those empty, black sockets.

Once the demon withdrew its arm completely, it reared back, standing on its hind legs. It stood taller than the trees. I realized I hadn’t been breathing and gasped for air. 

Without saying anything, with only its silhouette visible, it groaned and bent backward over itself and disappeared. 

Clifford and I looked at each other, fear plastered on our faces. We had no way of knowing at that moment, but somehow we both came to the same conclusion. The Pale Demon was not from the New World. Rather, it was something much, much older. 

Just like Father Westwood, Clifford White left Blythe the next morning without saying a word. He boarded his ferry and disappeared from my life. I called him several times, however, each call went straight to voice mail. When I looked him up online, everything about him had been deleted. His Facebook, webpage, everything, just gone. I don’t know what happened to him after that night and I doubt I ever will. I can only pray that he did not share the fate of the others.

Since our encounter, The Pale Demon finally broke me. A few nights ago I woke up in the middle of the nave. The pews had been pushed to the side of the room creating a central clearing. I lay in the middle of the clearing, naked, and covered in blood. Below me sat a massive rune, larger than any I have seen before. I don’t know where the blood and sinew came from. I’ve been curled up at the foot of my bed for hours crying on and off. All I wanted was for Spots to cuddle up to me but I couldn’t find him anywhere.
