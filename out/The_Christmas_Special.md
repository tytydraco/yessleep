**CW: sexual assault**

\*\*\*\*\*

The Christmas Special comes on TV, at 9:00 sharp, on December 18th.  

Like clockwork, it appears every year.  Always the same time.  Always the same day.

The Christmas Special isn’t always broadcast on the same channel.  Last year, it came on in the middle of a Golden Girls episode on Nick at Nite.  The year before, it interrupted World’s Funniest Home Videos.  Every year, the confused employees at the broadcast station report the same situation: they didn’t play the Christmas Special.  Their equipment just… malfunctioned.  As they messed with the signal, they heard strange ghostly voices: a man instructing a woman to lie down in bed.  The woman, slurring “okay.”

The Christmas Special centers around a college girl in a blue sweater dress and black tights, with tan skin and long, black hair.  The girl got drunk at a Christmas party the night before.  She wakes up under a giant Christmas tree to the sight of a rain-drenched college campus, with puddles and piles of debris everywhere.  The girl then proceeds to dance her way across campus, meeting other students in the middle their own R-rated holiday-themed adventures, singing an adult version of the “12 Days of Christmas” the entire time.  The plot goes: she must make it back to the party she attended the night before, to retrieve her “true love” before he leaves for Christmas break with another woman.

The Christmas Special is six minutes and thirty-three seconds long.  At the end, the girl in the blue dress finds her way to a little row house with a Spanish roof.  She prances up the front steps, opens the yellow door, and gasps.  

“Wow!  I can’t believe this is actually happening!” the girl says.

Then, the video ends.  The channel cuts back to regularly scheduled programming.  At the broadcasting station, the equipment begins functioning again as though the problem never existed.  

Since The Christmas Special first appeared, on a LA public access channel in 2015, it has grown in popularity from local curiosity to Reddit mystery to full-on cult obsession.  The filmmakers responsible for The Christmas Special have never been identified.  Nor have the actors.  Every year, there’s more of them.  More background actors.  And more featured performers, as well.  Each year, a new character appears, where the year before the main girl in the blue dress was only interacting with thin air.

People do have their theories.  The most popular one on Reddit is that the main girl is played by a young woman named Rowan Y.  Rowan’s parents are on the record admitting the girl resembles their daughter to an eerie degree.

But that’s impossible.

Because Rowan Y. has been missing since 2014.

\*\*\*\*\*

In 2014, I was a college senior, majoring in film production at a small Jesuit school in Los Angeles.  I was an awkward introvert then, a message board creature and a night owl who’d rather play video games than party (actually, I still am).  So I followed my bliss and became an editor.  My friends and I, when we weren’t in class or on set, got together in one of our on-campus apartments to smoke weed and watch movies, or else we worked on our baby.  And by “our baby,” I mean the comedy sketch show we wrote, produced and edited for our school’s student-run, campus-wide television channel.  

We called our show The Blue Balls Boys.  Each 21-minute, biweekly episode featured comedy videos we shot around campus.  Once, we filmed ourselves trying to break into the college president’s private office in order to fill it with black dildos - which got us chased by security and an official warning from the school discipline committee.  One of our group, Sunil, wrote some pretty funny sketches.  Like a game show to determine who farted.  Or a little gag where a girl thought her boyfriend was going to propose, but in actuality, he wanted to confess to her that he had gonorrhea.

We thought we were hot shit - Saturday Night Live and Jackass, all rolled into one.  In actuality, we were a bunch of immature kids messing around with a video camera.  But we did make some great memories.  Sunil and Cooper wrote and directed the episodes.  Andy, Hamed and Kohl, the most charismatic and shameless guys in our group, acted in them.  Chris, an aspiring cinematographer, was our cameraman.  My friend Will and I served as grips/PAs/sound operators and, once the content was shot, I’d edit the episodes and Will wrote the music.  When we needed female cast members, we’d call on Cooper’s girlfriend Hayley or Andy’s girlfriend Grace.  

In November of 2014, we decided to make a special Christmas episode of The Blue Balls Boys.  The same month, a confounding variable wandered into our lives.  

That confounding variable was named Bethany.  And she was every dweeby, introverted film nerd’s dream come true.

Hayley introduced Bethany to our group; they’d met in the Anime Club.  Bethany was drool-worthily gorgeous: slender but busty with silky red hair, a dimpled smile, and full lips.  And she liked all the geeky stuff we liked.  She could quote Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy, loved zombie movies and Quentin Tarantino, and kicked ass at the new Wolfenstein on Playstation.  Every unattached guy in our group (and also the attached guys) wanted Bethany.  I saw her face in my dreams.  But the one of us she wanted was Chris.  Serious, dark-haired Chris, who was respected throughout the film school for his cinematography skills. 

One complication stood in the way of Chris and Bethany’s love story: Chris’s longtime girlfriend.  Rowan.

Rowan was a first-rate snob.  She was a vegetarian who woke up early to work out; a film major with minors in economics and environmental studies who always made the Dean’s List.  She shot documentaries about global warming and labor abuses and sex trafficking in massage parlors.  Rowan was a feminist.  She and Chris had been a couple since freshman year.  And, since our group coalesced around The Blue Balls Boys, she’d been The Enemy.  The scheming Yoko who wouldn’t stop until she’d destroyed our awesome band.

Now that I’m a thirty-something adult, I can’t put my finger on what, exactly, Rowan had done to make us dislike her.  I’ve racked my brain for years.  Was it an offhand comment we misconstrued, or a dirty look?  Because she never really hung out with us, but she didn’t try to keep Chris away or make him choose between her and his friends.  She’d been a supportive girlfriend in every way she could.  Maybe, I catch myself thinking sometimes, we’d simply gotten our panties in a twist because Rowan raised her hand and talked in film studies class, and she didn’t care if we disagreed with what she had to say.

I still wanted Bethany for myself.  But my feelings clearly weren’t reciprocated, and I’d rather have had her around as Chris’s girl than not at all - especially if Bethany replaced the horrific Rowan.  But we’d been trying to convince Chris to break up with Rowan for years.  He’d resisted.  Rowan was a regular source of vagina for him, and frigid, stuck-up vagina was better than no vagina.

One night, as I worked late in the school’s editing bay, I stopped, kicked over my chair, and jumped up and down, fists in the air.

I’d done it.  I’d come up with the perfect plan to replace Rowan with Bethany on Chris’s arm.

In late November, the weekend before we all went home for Thanksgiving, as we gathered in my, Sunil, Cooper and Andy’s apartment to watch the latest episode of The Blue Balls Boys on Campus TV, I revealed my master plan to my friends.  Chris was gone, shooting a grad film in Santa Barbara.

The plan went like this: the night before we left, we’d throw a Christmas party at our apartment.  Grace, who was somewhat friendly with Rowan, would entice her to come to this party so that we could all get to know her better.  Chris, however, would not be there with her - again, he’d be away on set.  We’d then proceed to get Rowan drunk - so drunk she’d lose her inhibitions.  Then, we’d leave her with Will, the member of our group who’d always carried a bit of a torch for Rowan.  Will would seduce her.  They’d kiss, and one of the girls - either Grace or Hayley - would photograph their smooch on their phone, to be sheepishly sent to Chris.

Chris, furious at this infidelity, would break up with Rowan.  He might be pissed with Will as well.  But Will could apologize profusely, and we’d all make sure Chris saw things clearly: Rowan came on to Will, not the other way around.  Eventually, the two bros would make up - just in time for Bethany to make her move.

The only problem we could foresee was that Rowan had never been much of a drinker.  The few times I’d been out with her, she’d sipped a single glass of wine or nursed a margarita.  I doubted she’d get drunk enough on her own volition to lock lips with Will.

Kohl solved that little problem for us.  Beset by chronic motion sickness, his doctor had prescribed him scopolamine.  

Scopolamine, in high enough doses, can turn your average adult into a zombie.

Every university has its creepy legends.  At our film school, that creepy legend was the L&G Cat.  

The L&G Cat got its name because it hung around the soundstage, where the school’s lighting and grip equipment was stored, and because of its penchant for knocking things over.  Late at night, while a freshman student worker filled inventory sheets in the lighting and grip office, a crash might be heard.  When the froshie found his balls and went to the soundstage to confront the source of the loud noise, he’d find a rack of c-stands had come dislodged.  Or a light had fallen over.  Or a some flats collapsed like dominos.  

99% of the time, I’m sure the issue was less L&G Cat and more hung-over L&G student worker.  

But some stories couldn’t so easily be logicked away. Like the day Matt Yang came into work at the L&G office to find the cage open and all the cables they kept locked there tied together in so many intricate knots it took weeks to untangle the mess.  Or the time Aaron Cosrey was fixing a light, looked up, and saw a black-furred appendage - long and curling, like a tentacle - groping at the hand dolly.  

The L&G Cat’s supposed origins were murky.  It was an entity of the supernatural persuasion, conjured by a group of film students messing around with an Ouija board.  A spirit summoned to avenge a screenwriting major whose professor plagiarized his script.  The story changed per teller.  But everyone agreed the L&G Cat’s antics - and its powers - could far exceed scaring freshmen.

Two years before, a girl named Kimmy Romano rented out one of the school’s new Red cameras and found a memory card inside.  Out of curiosity, she plugged the card into her computer, and discovered 14 seconds of video footage.  

Two mismatched sock puppets with drawn-on faces, controlled by unseen hands, were in frame in front of the school’s old library building.  The sock puppets, in high-pitched, disguised voices, made really dumb jokes about the library.  Something like: “hey library, your mama’s so fat, her blood type’s marinara!  Hey library, you’re so ugly the mirror sued for emotional trauma!  You going to cry, library?  You gonna cry?”  Then, the video cut off abruptly.

Five days later, a pipe burst in the old library, dumping thousands of gallons of water.  The structural damage was too extensive to be worth fixing; most of the books had been moved into the new library, anyway.  So they tore the building down.  

It could’ve been a weird coincidence - the mysterious sock puppet video appearing right before before the library flooded.  But there was a darker side to the legend of the L&G Cat, one built on the idea it had figured out how to communicate via video.  

Some students believed the L&G Cat lived on top of Holt Hill - a gentle slope behind the film school and the old library, which led to a bluff and a panoramic view of Los Angeles.  They claimed if you walked to the bluff’s edge, cut yourself, and let the blood trickle down, your offering would earn you a favor from the L&G Cat.

A few years before the library incident, the L&G Cat had made a previous foray into videography.  A freshman rented a Mini DV camcorder from the camera department and, like Kimmy, found a used tape already inside.  

This video featured a greasy paper plate and a discarded Twizzlers wrapper with crude faces sharpie’d on.  The makeshift puppets performed their little routine in front of the engineering building.  

“Everyone loves Professor Miller,” the greasy plate chirped.

“Professor Miller is sooo respected,” the Twizzlers wrapper responded.

“All the students love Professor Miller!”

“I’ve heard the students love Professor Miller a little too much!”

“I heard Professor Miller is going to have a downfall!”

After fifteen seconds, the video ended.

Three days later, Professor Miller, a popular faculty member, fell down the steps of the engineering building and broke his leg in six places.  He was forced to take a year-long sabbatical.  

Soon after, a rumor made its way around campus.  A freshman girl had accused Professor Miller of sexually harassing her.  The department did little about the situation, and Professor Miller wouldn’t stop - there were texts, sexually-explicit Facebook messages.  So the girl went to the top of Holt Hill.  She pressed herself against the fence that separated the school from the steep drop of the bluff and ran a boxcutter knife across her palm.  And she asked the L&G Cat for revenge as her blood trickled down.

\*\*\*\*\*

Operation Ditch the Bitch went off without a hitch.

Rowan gratefully accepted Grace’s invitation to our apartment party.  She had no reason to be suspicious.  Grace, Hayley and Bethany were in attendance as well - other women, to make her feel safe.  She drank the Scopolamine-laced spiked cider Hayley handed her.  

An hour later, Rowan perched pensively on the couch with a dumb smile on her face, up for anything.  Will put up a bit of a fight - since the day we concocted our plan, he’d developed a crush on a freshman named Becca, and didn’t want to come off as a player by being photographed kissing another girl.  But alcohol wore down his inhibitions.  He wrapped his arms around Rowan and stuck his tongue down his throat.  Rowan, drugged and happy, looked just as into the kiss as Will was.  Grace took the picture.  Hamed sent it to Chris.  Then, Andy and I led Rowan into our room to sleep it off.  The rest of us celebrated by getting drunk off our asses and passing out.

The next day, as I packed for my trip home in a hung-over fog, Kohl - who was Chris’s roommate - texted me.

*Bro he DUMPED HER ASS!!!  He called her a dirty whore!*  

Two hours later, Kohl texted again.

*Dood Rowan came here to talk it out in person!!  She’s such a lying bitch.  She said Will assaulted her.  Chris told her to eff off and get out of his life.*

A little note from thirty-something me: even if Will had stopped at the kiss, that was already assault.  What we’d all done - drugged Rowan with Scopolamine - was assault.  We justified it, insisting we hadn’t given her the hard stuff, it wasn’t like we’d *roofied* her.  But on some level, even then, we knew we were bullshitting ourselves.

The Saturday after Thanksgiving break, the eleven of us got together to film our special Christmas episode of The Blue Balls Boys.  

I thought the material Sunil and Cooper came up with was pretty good.  But for some reason, when we actually filmed it, the vibes were all off.  The first skit featured Bethany running around the site of the old library, then under construction to become a new administrative building, in a bikini.  Let’s just say Chris put a *lot* of effort into getting the *perfect* shots. 

After that, though, the energy just wasn’t there.  Hamed and Kohl couldn’t get the timing down for Horny Santa.  Our Christmas prank - Andy and Cooper, stealing the blue balls off the giant Christmas tree they’d erected on campus - didn’t attract the shock and offense we’d expected from passers-by.  And the Slutty Elves sketch fell flat because the girls had no chemistry on camera.

Will brought Becca, his freshman crush, along to be our PA for the day.  She seemed just as into him as he was into her.  

\*\*\*\*\*

That winter had been a particularly dry one in California.  Besides a slight drizzle in October, we hadn’t gotten any rain all semester.  Then the night after we finished filming the Christmas episode, the weather switched on us like a bitch.  We got a downpour with the works: thunder, lightning, wind, and rain slamming against our apartment windows all night. 

The next morning, campus looked like a cross between a post-apocalyptic wasteland and the beach at low tide: drenched and dirty, with wind-tossed debris littered everywhere.

\*\*\*\*\*

A few nights after the windstorm, I sat down in the editing bay to cut the Christmas episode of The Blue Balls Boys.  Our footage sucked even harder than I thought it would. 

Only one sketch turned out good.  And it wasn’t even one I remembered shooting.

The sketch featured Rowan.  This was weird - Chris had only brought her along for The Blue Balls Boys once or twice.  But the sketch was actually funny.  Rowan, in a blue sweater dress and black tights, parodied a 60’s Christmas Special host.  She played a college girl who’d gotten drunk at a frat party, passed out under the giant Christmas tree, then woke up and had to re-trace her drunken steps in order to find her “true love” before he left for Christmas break with another woman.

It was just Rowan alone, pretending to interact with other college students.  But Rowan had a charming stage presence I’d never noticed.  Her comic timing, even alone, was perfect.  And in between R-rated jokes, she sang a dirty version of The Twelve Days of Christmas.  I didn’t even know Rowan could sing.  I still thought she was a cunt, but a little part of me wished Chris had involved her in The Blue Balls Boys more often.

I guessed Chris must have gone out and filmed with Rowan before they’d broken up.  But, I realized, that made no sense.  In Rowan’s sketch, the ground was wet and there were puddles and piles of random wind-blown detritus all around.  They’d clearly shot it after we’d shot everything else, after the rainstorm.  

I made a face.  Had Chris and Rowan gotten back together?

I decided to worry about it later.  I cut the episode and sent it to my friends.

Twenty minutes later, Will called me.  

“Bro, that thing with Rowan.  Please take it out,” he begged.  “Please, man.”

“But it’s the only thing that’s…”

“PLEASE, Blake,” Will insisted.  “Just cut it.  Please, please, please?”

I’d never heard Will sound so desperate.  I liked Rowan’s sketch, but I wasn’t so attached to it to be worth pissing off my friends.  So I promised him I’d cut the segment.  I guessed it would’ve been uncomfortable for Will, having to put Rowan’s voice to music after their brief, Scopolamine-induced romantic tryst.  

\*\*\*\*\*

December 18th, 2014 was our last day of school before Christmas break.  It was also the day the special Christmas episode of The Blue Balls Boys premiered on Campus TV.  

We gathered in my and the boys’ apartment to watch it.  Will cuddled with Becca on one side of the couch; Chris and Bethany wrapped around each other at the other end, groping each other between make-out sessions.  

Then, our theme music - which Will had written - jangled from the TV.  The intro to The Blue Balls Boys ran: our sophomore-year selves, posing on Holt Hill.  Then, the episode cut to a shot of Rowan, asleep on the soaked ground under the campus Christmas tree.

Rowan’s eyes snapped open.  “Oh!” She exclaimed, in a coquette-ish voice.  “Where am I?  Am I…” she patted her clothes, then said, disappointedly, “oh, I’m not naked.  Shame.”

She climbed to her feet.  Behind her, the campus was a rain-drenched apocalypse scene.

Will jumped to his feet, nearly knocking Becca off the couch.  “No!” he screamed.  “Screw you, Blake!  I told you to cut this!"

I was confused.  Because I had cut the Rowan sketch.  It shouldn’t have been anywhere near the final cut I’d given to the tech guy at Campus TV.  

“You’re an asshole, Blake!” Will continued. 

I shook my head, took my phone, and ran from my apartment.  Outside, I called Kevin, the Campus TV tech director.

“Bro, what did you do?” I asked Kevin.  “This isn’t the episode I gave you.”

“Um, I’m at the station now,” Kevin said, sounding perplexed.  “I’m playing exactly the cut you gave me.”

“Well, STOP IT!” I nearly yelled.

I heard Kevin pressing keys on a computer.  Then, he came back on the phone, even more weirded out.  

“This is really bizarre, Blake,” Kevin said.  “Um… the whole system is frozen.  Whenever I hit anything, I hear these foggy voices through my headphones.  A guy and a girl.  And… it’s kind of screwed up.  The girl sounds drugged, and the guy’s making her… do things to him.  Sexual things.  Oh!”

My entire body felt numb.  I considered the implications of what Kevin had heard - the guy and the drugged girl.

“Everything’s working again now, man,” Kevin reported.  “The system’s un-frozen.  Um, the video feed’s showing a girl in a bikini running around the library construction.  Is that yours?”

I muttered something to get Kevin off the phone.  Then, I saw Will.  He stood in a corner of the apartment complex hallway, leaning over the railing.  I approached him.  He was trembling.

“Will,” I said, “did you do something to Rowan?  Did you… touch her?”

I remembered, during our drunken revelry after Rowan and Will’s kiss, Will had vanished for awhile.  I wondered, had he…

“She wanted it, man!”  Will snapped desperately.  “I didn’t, like, force myself on her!”

He had.  After we’d put Rowan to bed, he’d slipped into my room after her.  In her drugged state, he’d realized, she consented to a kiss.  She’d definitely have agreed to… more than a kiss.  For Will, the situation had been too easy to resist.  I didn’t say anything.  But my utter horror must’ve been clear across my face.

“That video is wrong, Blake!” Will insisted.  “The episode.  It’s… not possible.  It can’t exist.”

“Why, man?”  I demanded.  “Why’s the video impossible?”

“Because Rowan is dead!”

A silence hung between us.  We let ourselves pretend his words hadn’t been spoken, that the words could be taken back.  But they couldn’t.

“It was an accident, man,” Will began.  “It was the Tuesday after Thanksgiving break.  Rowan and I met at the bench on Holt Hill.  I… apologized.”

“For assaulting her?” I asked incredulously.

“It wasn’t assault!”  Will said forcefully.  “I said I was sorry.  But she was being a total bitch!  She said she had to tell Becca about us.  Like, she thought I’d do something to Becca!  But you know that’s BS.  I’d never hurt Becca.  Becca’s different than Rowan.  She’s cool.”

“Will, what did you do?”

“It was an accident!”  Will whined desperately.  “I wrapped my hands around her neck just for a second!  A second, man!  And then she was dead.  I buried her on the construction site, the old library.  They poured concrete over her body the next day.”

Will’s haunted face broke into a manic smile.  

“But she must not be dead!  Because I buried her on Tuesday.  And… and it didn’t rain until Saturday!  And in the video, the ground’s all wet!  So, she must still be alive!”

\*\*\*\*\*

Rowan Y. was reported missing while we were away on break.  

I didn’t tell the cops what Will had told me.  I’d like to say I kept quiet out of naive loyalty to my friend, but let’s be real.  I didn’t rat Will out because I was scared he’d reveal to the authorities we’d all been complicit in luring Rowan to our apartment and drugging her.  So I kept quiet because I didn’t want my life to explode.

My friends and I never shot another episode of The Blue Balls Boys.  We stopped hanging out with each other, started spending more time outside our apartments, and with other friends.  Then we graduated and drifted apart.  

I found a job as an assistant editor for a company that cut together crappy reality shows.  I got my own apartment and made new, adult friends.  In October of 2015, I learned Bethany - Chris’s Bethany, the girl I’d been temporarily in lust with - had died unexpectedly.  Her appendix burst, and the resulting sepsis killed her.  

On December 18th, at 9:02pm, Chris called me.  We hadn’t spoken since graduation.

“Blake,” he stammered, “if you’re near a TV, switch to Channel 15.  Now.  You’ve got to see this.”

I turned on my TV and flipped to Channel 15.  I saw the Christmas Special.

It was Rowan’s sketch.  The one I’d cut from The Blue Balls Boys Christmas episode the year before.  The sketch that had magicked its way onto Campus TV anyways.  Now, that same sketch was playing on a public access channel.

Rowan, in her blue sweater-dress, pranced around campus.  Except now, there were a few people in the background that hadn’t been there before.  Then, Bethany appeared!  Bethany, in her bikini!  The year before, Rowan had been alone on camera, interacting with imaginary people.  In this version of the Christmas Special, Rowan engaged in cutesy conversation with Bethany.  Bethany’s character had been convinced to run around in her bikini by some frat boys, who’d told her they’d opened a pool on campus.  

“On the twelfth day of Christmas, my True Love gave to me,” the girls sang together, “twelve lads a-tuggin!”

I watched, mouth hanging open, blood frozen in my veins.

“Did you do this, Blake?” Chris asked.  “Did you… I don’t know, send that footage to anyone?”

“I didn’t,” I said.

And even if I had, what we were watching was impossible.  Rowan was dead.  Bethany was dead.  

We couldn’t figure it out, so we tried to forget about the Christmas Special.  Until the next year.

In April of 2016, Chris was killed in a motorcycle accident on the 101 freeway.  On December 18th, 2016, at 9:00 pm, the Christmas Special cut into regularly scheduled programming on LA’s NBC affiliate broadcast station.  That year, Rowan had a few more co-stars.  A few more randos wandered around in the background.  And, after Rowan and bikini-clad Bethany finished their scene together, Rowan ran into a young man carrying an armload of egg nog cartons - played by Chris!  Chris’s character was disposing of spoiled egg nog, which had caused a bit of a mess at his party the night before.

“On the eleventh day of Christmas, my true love gave to me,” Rowan and Chris sang, “Eleven ladies pooping!”

Every year since, the Christmas Special has appeared somewhere.  Always on December 18th, always at 9pm sharp.  Every year, there are more extras.  And every year, Rowan gets one new co-star.

2017: Sunil fell off a ladder and broke his neck.  2018: Cooper died of a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting.  2019: Kohl flipped his car on PCH.  In The Christmas Special, Rowan came across one, then two, then three boys pulling a wagon filled with black dildo-shaped Christmas ornaments, destined for the tree in the college president's office.

2020: Hayley succumbed to Covid.  The virus punched holes in her lungs.  In The Christmas Special, Hayley played a girl asking if Rowan would be interested in “snow.”  And by “snow,” Hayley meant drugs.  

“On the seventh day of Christmas, my True Love gave to me,” Rowan and Hayley sang, “seven straws for blow-ing!”

2021: Andy was killed in an apartment fire.  In The Christmas Special, Andy appeared as a boy looking for “green.”  And by “green,” he also meant drugs.  

2022: Hamed drowned while out on his family’s boat.  His role The Christmas Special was Sexy Santa.  All the girls on campus wanted to sit in his lap.  

2023: Grace was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer.  It took her quickly.  Last year’s Christmas Special cast Grace as a nerdy freshman - despite her looking like a 30-something woman - stalking Hamed’s Sexy Santa.  

This past June, I received word via our alumni newsletter that Will is dead.  His passing must’ve been spectacularly gruesome and painful: he somehow managed to contact antibiotic-resistant flesh-eating bacteria.  It’s December now, nearly the eighteenth.  I know this year, when The Christmas Special is broadcast somewhere, there’ll be a new character: a 30-something college student who looks like Will.  

And I know what’s coming next.

The rest of my friends are gone.  Next year, it’s my turn.  I suspect my death will not be an easy one.  And, maybe, I deserve it.  The entire incident - Rowan’s drugging, her kiss with Will - was my idea.  Because of my silence, Will never faced justice.  None of us did.  Because of me, Rowan’s family never learned what really happened to her.  Every year, her family is tormented anew: The Christmas Special appears, and they’re forced to stare at Rowan, eternally twenty-one and beautiful in her blue sweater dress.  

They don’t understand.  No one understands.  And Rowan’s family isn’t the only family tormented. 

Because all those extras?  The background actors that increase in number every year?  They’re real people, too.  Or else, they were.  As their numbers have grown and The Christmas Special has become more popular, some of the extras were identified as young people who’d died, typically from freak accidents or unexpected illnesses.  

The Christmas Special isn’t just killing my college friends.  It’s taking others, as well.  And each year, as its gravitational pull grows stronger, it takes more.  

I remember the legend of the L&G Cat.  Our campus spirit.  And I remember the story of the harassing professor with the broken leg, and the girl who gave her blood on Holt Hill for revenge.  Then, I think about Rowan.  Will killed Rowan right at the bluff’s edge.

Maybe, the L&G Cat considered her death a sacrifice.  Maybe the L&G Cat repaid Rowan with a favor: revenge on the classmates who’d set her up.  And maybe, after consuming Rowan's body, the L&G Cat became more powerful.  Before, it had been forced to make its videos with found objects - trash, lost socks.  But, with Rowan at its disposal… let’s just say the L&G Cat started holding casting sessions.  And by “casting sessions,” I mean it gained the ability to kill people and suck their souls into its video world. 

Next year, I will die.  But one thing scares me more than my impending death.

It’s the song Rowan sings: The Twelve Days of Christmas.  My friend group - her targets, including me - are only eleven in number.  It’s the last shot of the Christmas Special: Rowan, walking through a yellow door. 

She gasps.  “Wow!  I can’t believe this is actually happening!”

So I wonder - and I fear: what surprise does the L&G Cat have in store, after I’m dead?  What’s actually going to happen in Year Twelve?
