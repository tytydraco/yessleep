I’ve been working at Bethesda for almost fIve years noW, but nothing—*nothing*—prepared me for what happened after our most recent update for *Fallout 76*. We had just rolled out a huge patch, one that added a ton of new content. Players were raving about the new main quest, "Raid: Gleaming Depths," the overhaul to the perk card system, and the addition of pets. It was everything we had been working toward, and I felt a sense of pride that we finally nailed it. Even with the strike, those of us who stayed on were celebrating just a few days ago!

But now there is *that*—the thing I cannot shake from my mind.

It all started with the holotape, an in-game item. The one titled *"Filtcher Farm Interview."*

Now, the tape wasn’t new. It had been added several years ago, in one of the first major updates after the game launched. At the time, it seemed like just another piece of ambient lore we’d slipped in, one of those random objects players could find that might add a little flavor to the world. We never added the location where it was supposed to go, though. The *Filtcher Farm*—a supposed rundown farmstead, meant to tie into some vague side quest or area—was never implemented. The tape just sat there in the game files, waiting for its moment.

I had heard about it from the community over the years. Players found it, and, of course, they were curious. The tape was a strange one. The only voices you could really hear clearly were from two womens'— one was conducting an interview about the farm’, while the other is answering her questions. But if you listened closely, you could hear faint whispers in the background, barely audible but undeniably there.

I never thought much of it. Just a little Easter egg from an earlier time, I figured.

Until the reports started coming in again, after our most recent update.

Players won't stop complaining about the *"Filtcher Farm Interview."* And not in a good way.

They all said the same thing: they couldn’t *get rid of it.* No matter how many times they tried to drop it from their inventory, no matter how many times they server-hop: the tape would just *reappear*. It wasn’t just the fact that the item was unremovable—it was the *sound* coming from it.

And I—well, I thought it was all just another bug. No big deal. Happens all the time with those old massive updates - I wasn't responsible for that one. But then I heard it.

I was sitting at my desk late one night, trying to get ahead on a new project debugging this thing with ghoul characters, when I received a notification. Someone on the dev team had flagged the holotape again. It had been reported by multiple users, each claiming it was haunted.

“Haunted? Seriously?” I muttered to myself as I clicked open the file.

I should’ve stopped there.

The audio file was… odd. At first, it sounded like a normal interview. A southern accented voice-actor was speaking about the mysterious troubles of Filtcher Farm, the local area, and people coming and going from her land. In the background, you could hear the soft murmur of another voice, as if the interview was taking place in a room full of people. But then, I heard it.

The faint whispers.

I turned the volume up, replaying it again. The whispers were soft, just a few words, but I could make them out clearly:

*"He sees me. I saw him too. The Mothman... he’s coming for me."*

I froze. My heart began to pound in my chest. I quickly checked the metadata of the file—maybe it was just a sound glitch, a weird coincidence. But no. The file had been recorded years ago, and it was a part of the game's official release. So why, after all this time, was it only now becoming an issue?

Then I did something I should’ve avoided.

I decided to dig deeper into the story behind the voice I had just heard. The faint voice in the background belonged to Mabel Weathers—an uncredited voice actress who had been part of the early *Fallout 76* recordings. The strange thing was, Mabel’s voice was never intended to be prominent in the tape. She was just a background character, meant to add ambiance to the scene. In fact, her lines were so buried in the audio that most players never even noticed her.

But there, buried in the audio, I could hear her mention the Mothman. She’d only said a couple of barely audible words, but they were unmistakable. She had *improvised* them.

It didn’t end there.

Mabel Weathers had passed away tragically in a car accident shortly after her recording session. The accident happened on her way home from the studio, and it had shaken the entire team. The older devs all remembered the news, but it wasn’t until now, until I really listened to the tape, that I understood the gravity of what had happened. Mabel had mentioned the Mothman *before* her death. In fact, she had even been *obsessed* with the Mothman sightings in the West Virginia area. Both she and herr mother had claimed to have seen the creature, and Mabel—fearing something terrible was going to happen—had said she believed she would die soon.

That *was* the last time she recorded anything for the game.

But what truly sent a shiver down my spine was when I listened closer to the tape again. The words weren’t just some random comment. They were a warning. Mabel had known something, had felt something was closing in on her—and it wasn’t just about her death. She had known about the Mothman, the creature lurking in the shadows of the game’s setting, and now, somehow, it felt like she had *left* a piece of herself behind in the game.

The most unsettling part? The *tape* itself wouldn’t leave the players alone. No matter how many times we fixed the bug, no matter how many patches we pushed through to remove the holotape or make it vanish from the inventory… it always came back. And players, after hearing it, were left haunted by Mabel’s whispering words. It wasn’t just some bug. It was as if Mabel was trapped, reaching out from the other side.

Some players claimed they could hear her voice clearer now, as if the more they listened, the more they could make out of her desperate warning. She goes on:

*"The Mothman is real.*

*And I think he’s still out there, watching.*

*And as much as I want to forget about it, I can’t. No one can.*

*It’s in the game. It’s alive."*

And I’m terrified that soon, it won’t just be the players who are listening to Mabel’s warning.

I fear the Mothman is already watching us, too.
