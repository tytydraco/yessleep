Hey, so I know it’s been a couple of weeks since my first post. It took me a while to find one of the stumblers. The guy didn’t have much to say though. Was just mumbling about wanting to go home. I did, however, pick up some more stories, a couple of ‘em are even about the stumblers. I’ll start with some of the more mundane stuff though. 

Jimmy and I got put on a site together last week. We got to talking about the story he had told me and Allie at the bar. We were having a smoke with some of the other guys on the job, so naturally, they joined in on the conversation. One of the men on our crew was this burly guy named Jamison. When he heard Jimmy and me talking about the homeless population he jumped in with his own story. 

“I ran into this weird druggie at a gas station the other day. The guy seemed alright at first. He was sitting on a bench and I parked my car right in front of him. I get out and he holds the door open for me then walks in behind me. I was just there for a pack of cigarettes so I made a B-line for the counter. As I was getting in line I watched the guy walk past me, and out the door at the other side of the station. There were like three or four people in front of me in line, right? This guy walked in the door I followed him through and out the other twelve times in how long it took me to get to the front of the line. As I was walking out of the store, he comes through the door for round thirteen. He was mumbling to himself and walking all funny. I asked him if he wanted my change, but he just ignored me.” 

“Sounds like a stumbler,” I said. One of the guys in the circle, Tom, nodded, the rest looked kind of confused. 

“You know, like the druggies that kinda got something off about ‘em. Like something in the way they walk. That’s why we call ‘em stumblers.” He chimed in. 

“Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, I run across the ones that give you that sorta off feeling. Like you can’t tell something’s wrong about them, but you just can’t put your finger on what it is.” Jameson responded. 

“Yeah exactly,” Jimmy answered. 

“ Have you guys been noticing more of ‘em lately?” I asked the group, a little cautiously. I looked around to see scratching of chins and nodding of heads. 

“You know, now that you mention it, I have been seeing a lot of ‘em these past few weeks,” Tommy answered. “Ran into this one guy on my way home one night who kept mumbling to himself about being lost or something. The guy was just standing on an overpass looking towards the city. Wouldn’t even look at me when I tried to get his attention” 

I thought about the story Jimmy had told me, and the one I had heard from my buddy, about the lady who had wandered into his site. 

“You ever really talked to any of ‘em?” I asked hesitantly.

”Nah, not really man, yelled at a couple to get off my site, but they never responded.” He answered.  “Why have you?” 

I shook my head, giving Jimmy the perfect opportunity to jump back into the conversation. He told the group about the guy he had met and the story he had been told. They all listened in with peaked interests, before putting forth their theories about the man on the other side of the tunnel. 

“Just sounds like your average tweaker, man,” Tom said, coldly. 

“Nah man” Jimmy shot back. “The guy knew about the stumblers, knew about that off feeling you get when you’re around them. He said this man gave him that same feeling.” 

“What do you think he was pointing at?” Jameson asked the group. 

“God if I know man, and whatever it was, I think I’d prefer to keep it that way,” Tom answered. 

We kept talking about the subject, chain-smoking three or four cigarettes before the foreman caught on and started yelling at us to get back to work. The funny thing is, the more we discussed the story of the homeless man, the more confused I became. I thought about it a lot on my way home from work. I think Allie could tell something was on my mind and she pestered me about it while we were having dinner in front of the TV. 

“Everything alright Rod?” She asked, lying her head on my shoulder. 

“I’m fine, it’s just been a long week.” A half-assed lie that she picked up on immediately. 

“Are you sure there’s nothing else?” 

“Alright,” I sighed, “I guess I’ve just been thinking about that story Jimmy told us a lot lately,” I admitted. She looked at me, a bit concerned, yet softly. 

“I thought there was nothing to be worried about.” 

“There’s not. I don’t know… there’s just, something that stuck with me.” 

“What?” She asked. 

“Honestly, I can’t put my finger on it.” 

“It was a pretty messed up story.” 

Allie and I talked for a little while longer before finishing our dinner and lying down on the couch to watch a movie. She seemed to still be a bit worried about me following the conversation, but I did my best to reassure her that everything was fine. I need to do my best to keep her out of all this from now on. 

So last week, I was at this meeting for a site we were about to begin work on and decided to stick around afterward and see if any of the guys who had been with the company for a long time had any good stories to tell. Boy, did I hit a gold mine. I’ll pass along a couple in this post but I’ve got more I want to write about so I’m going to save the rest for future updates. 

I met a man named Michael at this meeting. He had taken the seat next to me before it had started and we had talked a bit beforehand. He was an older man, hardened by the work he had dedicated his life to, and the passing of time. Told me he had been with the company for 20 years now, and before this was pouring concrete for another company. We talked for a good ten minutes before the suits got the ball rolling. After the meeting, I found myself in a conversation with him and a couple of the other higher-ups at the company. For a while, we just talked about the current sites we were on and other bullshit like that. I didn’t want to press the questions that were on my mind too quickly. We ended up at a bar, and after a couple of rounds, I decided to bring up the oddities I had begun to notice in the homeless population. Most of the guys that had stuck around to that point knew what I was talking about when I asked about the stumblers. A couple of ‘em had some good stories too. The one I want to pass along today was a story that Michael told me. There were only three of us left at the bar by that point. Michael, myself, and a man named Henry. We had been talking about the homeless population for at least two or three hours already. Michael looked down at his half-empty drink, before raising the bottom of it towards the ceiling of the bar. 

“Alright gentlemen, I think I’m gonna head out.” 

“Think I’ll go too,” I responded. 

The third guy decided to stay for another round. Michael and I began our walk toward where we had parked. It was a chilly night. A blizzard had run through the country a week prior, and the snow and cold had stuck around. I felt bad for anyone out on the streets tonight…

“You got any more stories of stumblers man?” I asked Michael. He thought for a second before looking up at me and saying, 

“I’ve got one, but I probably shouldn’t tell you. Company spent a lot of money covering it up.” 

“What? It was that serious?” 

“Oh yeah, cops, firefighters, the whole ten yards. The only reason that we were able to keep away from any media attention after the incident was that it happened at three in the morning.” 

“Come on man, now you gotta tell me. I'm not gonna go spreading it around.” I pressed. 

“Alright, Alright kid, I’ll tell you, but you gotta promise not to tell anyone else.” 

“Yeah man, I promise.” Sorry, Michael. 

“It happened around ten, fifteen years ago. I was overseeing a site on 54th, around Chesterton. It was a bridge the company had been hired to help restore. I was finishing up some paperwork for the night at around two. It had been a long day and at that point, I was ready to drag my ass home. Never quite works out that way though huh? Just as I’m about to finish up, one of my workers comes in all red in the face, gasping for air. After he catches his breath tells me some guy has climbed onto one of the support beams of the bridge and is just staring. Says he won’t respond, no matter how much everyone yells at him. I asked the guy how many people knew about this. Whole crew, he tells me. Now I know I got a fucked situation on my hands. I told the guy to call the cops and I got a hold of the fire station on my way out to the bridge. Sure as shit this guy has somehow managed to shimmy his way up a half-put-together support beam and was perched at the top, just staring off towards the heart of the city.” 

“Holy shit man!” I exclaimed. “How have I never heard of this?” 

“Like I told you, the company spent a lot of money covering this shit up.” Michael answered “Anyway, the rescue brigade eventually shows up, sirens blaring. At first, it’s just some police officer on a blowhorn trying to talk the guy into coming down. No matter what he said this man wouldn’t respond, didn’t even take his gaze off whatever he was staring at. After about 15 minutes of that, the guy just gives up. Next, the firefighters come in with the ladder. The cops freaking out because he thinks they’re gonna spook the guy into jumping, but they decide it’s their best bet to get the guy down. This man didn’t move a muscle as they were extending that ladder, didn’t even flinch. Just kept on staring out over the city. It was only when one of the firefighters grabbed him and pulled him back into the basket of the ladder that he snapped back into it.” 

“What happened next?” I asked. 

“Well at first the guy was really freaking out. Didn’t know where he was. It took a while for the firefighters to calm him down, but eventually, he started to talk. While all this is happening I’m giving my report to one of the officers and he tells his partner to bring the guy over. He looks at me and goes ‘Could you give me a moment?’ But doesn’t walk away or ask me to leave, he just starts questioning the guy right in front of me. I could tell just by the way he  walked towards us that he was a stumbler.” 

Michael proceeded to tell me the conversation that he overheard between the man who had perched himself on the steel beam and the cop. I’ve transcribed it as best as I can remember but I was a little drunk that night and reading it back now it seems so outlandish. I’m not quite sure what to make of it. Anyway here it is, let me know what y’all think about the whole thing. 

“Do you know where you are, son? Can you tell me your name?” The cop led off. 

“My name’s Henry and we’re on 54th I think. Right?” The man replied, awfully quiet. Michael said he had to strain his ears to catch what he was saying. 

 “Alright Henry, I’m Officer O’Malley.” (Michael told me the officer's actual name, just as drunk as I was apparently. I’ve changed it in the story to avoid any legal issues.) 

Officer O’Malley continued, “You have any idea how you got here Henry?” 

“No, not really.” 

“You take anything tonight son?” O’Malley asked. 

Henry looked at his feet, then back up at the officer, nodding his head gently. He looked defeated. Michael said he didn’t think he’d ever seen someone who looked to be in so much despair. Told me it made a shiver run down his back just thinking about it. Said that the look this man gave him when he happened to briefly pass his gaze Michaels way, reminded him of the look people in horror movies have when they know the killer’s closing in on them. Officer O’Malley seemed to pick up on it too, and he softened his disposition towards the man. 

“You got a place to stay man? Like an actual place, not just a tent or something.” 

“I used to, I think.” Replied Henry. 

“You think?” Asked Officer O’Malley as he jotted something down on his notepad. 

“Yeah, it’s all so cloudy lately. Ever since…” Henry trailed off. 

“Since what?” Asked the O’Malley. To this, Henry began shaking his head back and forth in disagreement and chanting. 

“NO, NO, NO, NO” 

“Alright calm down, we don’t have to talk about that right now.” O’Malley said, placing a hand on the side of the man’s shoulder. “Look I’m gonna take you into the station tonight and give you a warm bed to sleep in. I’ve got a few more questions for you but if you want to wait till tomorrow morning to get your capacities back, I understand.” 

“It’s fine, I can answer them tonight,” Henry replied. He was still a bit visibly shaken but his voice had steadied a bit. 

“Do you remember climbing up that steel beam?” O’Malley said, pointing. 

“No, just being pulled down by the firefighter.” 

“What’s the last thing you remember before that?” O‘Malley continued jotting down notes as he asked his next question. Henry, for his part, shuddered a bit before answering the question. 

“He… or it told me to shoot up again.” 

“Who told you?” 

To this, Henry became more unsettled. He began to rock back and forth with his hand crossed over his chest, the handcuffs rattling against his body. He began to shake his head back and forth again. 

“I don’t know.” 

“What do you mean? Like it’s someone who you don’t know? Was it your dealer?” O’Malley pursued.

“No, no it’s not like that, it’s like, this voice that tries to tell me what to do?” He said, shakely. The dread in his eyes had escalated as they began to dart back and forth, surveying the scene around him as if he expected to be ambushed at any second. 

“In your head?” 

“No, I hear it around me, like I can hear you. Only there’s never anybody there, just a voice. I think he told me to…” 

Henry trailed off once more, before slumping his head down to his chest. At this, Officer O’Malley put his hand back on the man’s shoulder and gave him a gentle nudge. 

“You alright kid?” 

Henry looked up. The dread was gone. The confusion was no more. All that was left was an empty stare. The kind of stare that shoots right through you. He stared straight at Officer O’Malley and began to mumble. 

“Where am I? It’s so cloudy here. I want to go home.” 

Michael told me that he just kept repeating that phrase, over and over, no matter what O’Malley asked or did to try to bring him back into lucidity. Said it was like a switch flipped in the guy's head. One moment the guy’s freaking out, yet still able to have a conversation, the next he’s completely apathetic and will only repeat the same three sentences. After that Officer O’Malley phoned an ambulance and put Henry in the car. It took them a while to show up. Once they did arrive, O’Malley ushered Henry out of the car. The paramedics tried to talk to him, but all he would offer in response was that same phrase. 

“Where am I? It’s so cloudy here. I want to go home.” 

Just kept at it, over and over again. Michael said he had no doubt the man had been doing this the whole time they were waiting on the ambulance. Said he glanced over to the patrol car a few times while Officer O’Malley finished taking a report from him. Each time he had looked over, he’d seen the man’s lips moving. He couldn’t hear the words but the thought of the phrase the man was repeating sent shivers down his spine. The paramedics eventually gave up on trying to talk to Henry and decided just to sedate him and put him on a stretcher. He was still mumbling as they loaded him onto the ambulance, shut the doors, and sped off, followed promptly by O’Malley. 

I’ve thought about this story a lot since that night. The man’s affect snapping between lucidity and apathy. The conversation between him and O’Malley, and the oddities within it. What had possessed him to climb up that steel beam? What was the voice that he had talked about? Was he just crazy and not able to tell the difference between a voice in his head? The idea of hearing a disembodied voice close by, yet not being able to see the source of it is haunting. Something told me, however, that this man was just insane. Maybe I just wanted to find a way to rationalize the whole thing. But there are connections between this story and the ones I’d heard before: The mumbling, the lost look they all have, and the similarities of the phrases. All three people had wandered into some place they shouldn’t have been, and when questioned about it, only answered with fragments of sentences. It's got to mean something. I’ve tossed and turned about the whole thing since then. I just don't know what to make of it all. Anyway, I have one more conversation to tell you guys about. This one isn't about anything crazy, but it also got me thinking about the situation. I’ve got this buddy, Joey. We get put on the same site pretty often so he and I have become pretty close over the years. Anyway, I was asking him what he thought about all the homelessness in the city. 

“It’s a damn shame man.” He started. “Thousands of people with nowhere to live, doing any drug they can get their hands on. It’s no way to live, and the city does nothing about it. Mayor just wants to sweep it all under the rug and pretend it’s not happening.” 

“Shoot man, didn’t realize you felt so strongly about it,” I responded to my friend. He looked off towards the heart of the city for a second before going on.

“I got some relatives that ended up on the streets. One of them got into meth, then heroin. Died of an overdose a couple of years ago. Who knows the kind of shit that was getting cut into whatever he was buying. The autopsy said that he had died from fentanyl. I just wish the people running the city gave a shit or at least tried to do something to improve the situation.” 

“Yeah man, I know what you mean. I see druggies almost every night at this point. Seems like it’s just getting worse and worse the last couple of years.” I said. I asked him if he noticed anything off about any of them, but he didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Said they all just looked like poor souls addicted to drugs to him. 

Our conversation had sparked a bit of doubt in me. Was I just overthinking the weird instances I’d heard about through the grapevine? Was there really something going on with parts of the homeless population, or had I just been letting my paranoia get the better of me? No, there was something more than just an off-cadence to their walk or the repeated mumbling that put me on edge. Something that came with a sense of dread. If one were not used to being around the population late at night they might just chalk it up to an uneasiness that’s associated with putting oneself in danger’s way. But the more I examined this unease, the more it grew.

The story of the man that Jimmy had told Allison and I had stuck with me. There hasn’t been a day since I heard it that it hasn't come back into the forefront of my mind. It’s made its residency in my thoughts and it doesn’t seem like it will vacate them any time soon. The way that the homeless man was repeating the same phrase over and over, and the similarities to the story my other coworker had told me, and now the one I had heard from Michael. I didn’t know why it felt so impactful to me, but something about it made me want to know more. Why did all the stumblers seem to only repeat the same thing? From both Jimmy and Michael's stories, it seemed like some of them were more cognizant than others. Was it simply how messed up they were, or how long they’d been using? The question that’s burned the hottest in my head, however; what was that man under the pipe pointing towards? Was it the same thing that the man on the beam had been staring off at? Was there some sort of drug ring peddling the newest, and most intoxicating chemical our city had seen? Could that be what was behind the stumblers? I needed answers, so I asked Jimmy to give me the number of the guy who told him the story. 

His name is Marcus. I texted him a couple of days ago and explained who I was. He said that he remembered Jimmy. Said he had bought a couple ten strips off him since they met. Typical Jimmy. We texted about some other bullshit for a while before I got to what I was truly after. I asked if he would meet me some time to talk about his story. He agreed and said there were a couple of others he could tell me. I’ll post them if there's anything that stands out to me. I don’t exactly know what I’m hoping to discover by talking to Marcus. He certainly has done his fair share of experimenting with narcotics so maybe he would know something if a new street drug was popping up. Maybe he has some answers that I haven’t stumbled across yet as to why some of the homeless population seems so off. Maybe he knows why it seems like every week I happen to see one or two more of the stumblers than the last. Anyway, I’ll update you after I get in touch with him. For now, be safe, and take care of yourself. You never know who you may come across out in the odd hours of the morning.
