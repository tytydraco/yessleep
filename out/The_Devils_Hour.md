I’ve always had experiences with the paranormal, and the same goes for my entire family, whether it’s seeing, feeling or just hearing them. However, this specific experience happened when I was 12 years old in the Philippines.

My cousins and I would always stay at our grandparents house for the summer. One night, I woke up to the sound of my aunt calling my name. I didn’t answer because when I looked at the time.. it was 3AM. Devil’s hour. I knew enough not to answer to someone calling you especially during this time. A few seconds later, I heard her calling my name again. I still didn’t answer but this time, I decided to go check and see if she was really calling me.

I got out of bed, opened the bedroom door and stood frozen as I came face to face, only inches away from my face, with a girl that had a huge wound on her face, from her left eyebrow to her right cheek.

Blood dripping all over as she opened her mouth. The smell was so bad. It smelled like death. It was nauseating.

She mumbled “tulungan mo ako (help me)”, multiple times. As she said this, I realized what was happening.

We were always told by the elders not to talk to ghosts or don’t help them if they asked for help because it would make the ghost follow you until they’re satisfied.

So I walked past her instead. I didn’t bother looking behind me and went straight to my aunt’s bedroom. I opened the door and saw my aunt sleeping soundly in her bed. Then I knew someone or someTHING was playing tricks on me.

I walked out of my aunt’s bedroom and there was the little girl again. This time, it wasn’t just her. There was a younger boy next to her. They were holding hands. The boy didn’t have a face, and the girl mumbled the same words, except she addressed both of them “tulungan mo kami (help us)”. I looked at their feet and saw that they both had chains on each of their feet.

I usually wasn’t scared of ghosts as I’ve always seen them, so I ignored what the elders told us and talked to her. I said I was sorry and told her I’m only a kid and I can’t help them. After saying that, they vanished. I felt relieved, thinking it was gonna be over.

It wasn’t.

I heard a scream from outside the house and a gut feeling made me go out the patio and check what was going on. I looked around and my eyes landed on the mango tree on our neighbors yard. There stood a couple, one wearing a wedding dress and the other wearing a “barong”. They were facing me, but there was a problem, they didn’t have heads. So I closed my eyes for a few seconds and when I looked again, they were gone.

I looked at the moon, it was a full moon. Wondering why all of these were happening. Suddenly, a cold breeze rushed through and I saw a bat-like creature going into view in front of the moon. I knew it was a “manananggal”, a half upper body bat-like creature. I could fuck with ghosts, but not with monsters.

I ran back to the house, locked the door and made sure all the windows were closed. As I was waiting for the manananggal to pass, I felt eyes behind me. I looked and it was the same little girl. But this time, she didn’t say anything. Instead, she was just staring into my soul. I was feeling annoyed at this point. So I told her off.

“I’m not scared of you! If you’re the one doing all these to me, I don’t care! I’m still not gonna help you! So go away!” I said.

She screamed. A bloodcurdling scream. It was so loud. Then she was gone.

I fell to my knees. I was shaking. I felt like throwing up. But I pushed myself up and went back to the bedroom. I looked at the time, 3:03AM. All these happened in 3 minutes. How? I don’t know.

I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn’t. The next morning, I asked my aunt if she remembered calling my name and asked my cousins if they heard any screaming that night, they said no. So I dropped it.

To this day, I can still vividly remember what happened. I still don’t know if that was a dream or if it really did happen, but it all felt so real. I never saw the little girl again, and I’m stateside now, but there are still times where I would feel eyes on me or hear random noises around my house. I just hope the little girl or whatever the things I saw that night didn’t follow me.
