Monoliths pregnant with water and fury flickered upon the distant horizon. They drifted slowly, inevitably, covering the earth in shadow. The fear on the flight was palpable, made worse by the sounds of babies crying and first-time fliers yelping every time the plane shook. 

It was nearly enough to distract me from a distant point by the foothills where what remained of Mister Fulcrum’s Funhouse gathered dust within the mountain shade. 

Nearly. 

The airplane rocked violently again, sending up a fresh wave of screams. The stewardess and her team valiantly tried to calm the passengers down, but I could tell by the rising pitch in their voices that they were worried too. This storm was set to be epic in proportion, one of the most powerful ones in recent decades. 

My eyes drifted as I tried to blink away outlines of light that shimmered around others, but it looked like my perception was permanently fucked. 

When I focused it helped reduce the brightness of their aura but then I could perceive beyond the surface to a person’s very core. In that deep place was a nexus of energy, an interplay of the purest white light and shadow. Some had greater concentrations of one over the other, yet there was not a single person, no matter how good, who didn’t have a bit of shadow. 

There was also not a single person, no matter how bad, who didn’t have a star burning in the center of all that hurt. 

You might be wondering whether I was able to see my own deep-nature, and the answer is no. Even if I could I would not want to. 

You probably think that I am a good man because I have a ‘noble’ cause but the reality is I have done a whole lot of bad in my life, and there are times where I feel like the world would be better off if I wasn’t in it. The only thing I’ve ever been good at is killing. Destroying. That’s weak shit. It’s harder to be patient and build something. 

It made me wonder how these folks would react if somehow, someway, this plane slipped into The Void. Would they deal with it better than I had? Was there something about the nature of the Void that reflected the worst in us? 

The finger twitched in my pocket. I growled and gave it a nice swat. It had been doing that ever since I left Chicago. I sighed, more than a little irritated, and turned back to the window. 

Pressed up against it was the sagging face of a frog-like being with saucer-sized eyes that glowed like lanterns.

My fists clenched as I returned to my mantra where I chanted my parents names over and over in tandem with my breathing. 

The Void had left its mark. These spirits were following me now, and in this world they weren’t incorporeal beings incapable of hurting me.

But that was fine, I could hurt them too. 

I made a finger-gun and fired it between frog-man’s eyes. It grinned, licked the window with a barbed tongue and jumped away, its bulbous body vanishing into the clouds. 

After the plane touched down, I went on the hunt for some coffee. I decided to stick with the crowd this time, and among that chaotic mess of arguing families, annoyed businessmen, and travelers I was able to stop shaking. 

I eventually found a nicely crowded cafe with a view onto the airport tarmac. I ordered a large black coffee along with a crispy breakfast sandwich stuffed with hash browns, eggs, bacon, and cheese. I asked for an extra side of jalapeños and then took a seat near the window. 

The rain was coming down heavy outside. Low visibility, but good for the work I intended to do. I lost myself in the simple conversations taking place around me and finally enjoyed a hot meal. 

I was about halfway through my sandwich when I realized something was wrong. I patted my pocket, then my jacket. “Shit, shit, shit,” I muttered, frantically looking around. 

The finger was gone.

Had I dropped it? Or did someone steal it? 

I was searching by the cafe’s register when I heard someone yell, “snake! A snake!” The cry hung in the air for a moment before the mass of people instantly became a mess of shoving, pointed fingers, and cursing. Then, as people tended to do in an emergency, they started knocking each other over and running every which way. 

Terrified that they would smash what I could only assume was the finger, I sprinted shoulder-first and pushed my way through the commotion, sending people flying left and right. “MOVE!” I roared. 

I spied the finger slithering away as fast as it could towards the bathrooms. I dove for it but the damn thing wiggled underneath the bathroom door. 

“You little shit,” I roared. I kicked the door open and stepped right into a puddle of water. 

The entire bathroom was flooded. Through flickering lights I saw the finger floating by the stalls. It had gone rigid. 

I pressed forward through water levels nearly knee-height. I couldn’t see or hear a source of the flooding — the sinks were off and I didn’t think a toilet could be responsible for all the water. 

I grimaced before leaning over to scoop it up. “More trouble than you’re worth,” I said after giving it a few shakes and zipping it up tight in my pocket. 

I was stumbling back towards the exit when a great mass moved impossibly beneath my feet, as if rising from the ocean depths. It glided smoothly through the water, circling around me first before swimming around the corner. The lights overhead flickered faster, until I was only seeing snapshots of the bathroom. 

I listened and heard something breach the surface, followed by wet plopping sounds. 

*RIBBIT* *RIBBIT* 

Webbed hands wrapped around the corner as a body meant for crushing pressure came into view. Its veined pot belly sagged to its knees, yet the legs and shoulders were heavy with muscle. Big red eyes pointing in different directions suddenly focused on me. 

“What do you have there,” he croaked. A long barbed tongue slid out of his rubbery mouth and tasted the water. His eyes gleamed. “Such power contained within that salt-flesh.” 

I raised my jaw and rolled my shoulders. “You ain’t got the right kind of heart for this fight frog-man.”

He took a step forward. The sheer power of his webbed foot hitting the tile caused the walls to crack. He blew green mucus from his orifices and laughed. “I taste your fear, ape.”

I was afraid. He had trapped me in a kill box and I would not be able to take him down with just my hands and feet. I searched for something, anything that I could use to kill him with, and all the while the water continued to rise. More demons were coming with it. “What is it y’all want? The finger?” 

“Keep the finger. I care not for it. But you, you burned so bright that I could see you from the Chasm. Once I consume you, I will have your spirit forever. That can be a powerful tool, especially when one is already claimed by a god,” he chortled. 

He suddenly leaped towards me, his thick arms outstretched and pink tongue shooting out. 

I dove beneath the waves and kicked towards the exit. I was never the fastest swimmer, but I think the frog was counting on my fear of the water and overshot because of it. Thousands of eyes that glowed like coals watched from the depths, and they were rapidly getting closer. 

I scrambled onto the ledge and narrowly avoided a pink blur that punched a hole into the wall. I threw the door open and ran, the army of frogs’s wet laughter following me out of the airport. 

I got into my work truck and sped out of the lot. I didn’t let my foot even slightly off the pedal until I was well onto the freeway. 

The world was changing and I couldn’t keep up with it. Serpentine creatures with wings soared through the clouds, many-limbed felines hopped from roof to roof, and orbs of light shot across the skies. 

My mind was slipping away from me again and I knew I didn’t have much longer left before I was incapable of seeing things through. I would become a living corpse, frozen by wave after wave of increasing spiritual sight. 

I didn’t care what they did with my body after my mind was gone. All I needed was to see Mister Fulcrum dead, and I would be ready to die. 

When I was closer to home I passed a gas station near a crossroads where my dad used to bring me to get snacks before we went on hikes. A giant stood there now. It was over fifteen-feet in height and covered in blood. Empty eye sockets followed me as I drove past. 

I gripped my steering wheel so tight it nearly broke. There wasn’t a gun I owned big enough to put that fucker down. 

Finally, I yelled. I couldn’t tell you what emotions were in that cry. All I can say is there is only so much a human can take, and even the strongest soldiers can break from the weakest of blows if they have already weathered too many. 

The rain still hadn’t let up when I pulled into the driveway. I stopped on the porch in order to take it all in, knowing in my soul this was the last time I would. I regretted distancing myself so much from the place. 

Outside of some dust, everything was in good condition. Like I mentioned I hardly spent much time here, preferring to stay in wayside motels whenever I was in town. There were just too many ghosts. 

In the living room I saw myself as a kid playing with toys while my parents smiled. I could see the pure joy on my little face, along with the shadow of a worry that they might end up not loving me after all and return me to the orphanage. 

In the kitchen my mom made heart-shaped blueberry pancakes. She kissed me on the top of my head and told me how much she loved me and that nothing would ever change that. 

Out in the back my dad taught me how to ride a dirt bike. I remember falling nearly every time I got on for the first few weeks. My dad would always tell me to get back up and try again. Said that’s how to deal with any problem in life. Always get back up. Always try again. 

My vision blurred as I trudged through the empty home, my footsteps echoing like the memories of their love. I slammed open the door that led into the garage and passed by my dad’s tarp-covered sportster, it had been some time since I last took her out for a spin. 

I gave my gear a good look over, making sure everything was functioning well. The familiar smells of oil and iron grounded me. Once I was satisfied I strapped on my combat vest and double-checked that the witch’s finger was still inside my pocket. 

It was. 

I hated that feeling of relief I felt. 

I set the Visitor’s gift down on my workbench and inspected it beneath the lamplight. It was about a foot long and heavy. There were no inscriptions on it or buttons of any kind. The surface was smooth and gave off a slight vibration. On a whim I held it up to my ear because I was going to give it a shake. Then I heard the sound of waves crashing against the shore. Slow, calm, and powerful. 

The energy of the baton, if that was the right word, was the opposite of the witch’s finger. It just frustrated me that I didn’t know what to do with it. 

I was packing extra rounds when I heard a low moan resound throughout the landscape. A wave of barks rose to meet the giant’s cry and I saw flocks of birds fly away, preferring to brave the storm than to remain. I wiped the grime away from the garage window to better peer through. About a mile out was a solid row of those eyeless giants. They were headed towards the neighborhood, and ahead of them appeared to be more of the frog-men, along with a host of other creatures I could not identify. I considered simply destroying the finger in that moment, but something told me that all of this would only end once Mister Fulcrum was dead. 

I had made my choices and it was time to face the consequences. I didn’t fear that. I welcomed it. A wild grin lit up my face as I revved the sportster. She purred for me, ready for one last ride into a thunderous Hell. 

The earth was drowning, her face hidden from the burning skies. A winding road marked my final destination into an encounter with a being who had served as the focal point of my life ever since he robbed me of the only people who ever loved me. 

Death followed close behind, but I was faster, a blur of lightning and rage, single-minded in my pursuit of one thing and one thing only — the sight of Fulcrum’s face behind the barrel of my gun and the feeling of the trigger against my finger. 

I howled in defiance against nature’s fury and her blinding light, “FULCRUM! FULCRUM! FULCRUM!”
