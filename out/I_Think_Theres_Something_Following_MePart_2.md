Alright, a lot of new stuff has happened recently.

If you’ve seen my last post about a week ago you already know the deal, but here's the gist for people just tuning in. A couple months back, this uncanny valley creature (to which I dubbed “Mr. Blank”) started stalking me to my work and apartment. I don't know what it is and I asked some of you for help on getting rid of it. So far, I’ve gotten some good feedback. But, I decided to follow the advice given to me by u/naxyom076.

As sad yet reasonable as Mr. Blank being a projection from my brain as a result of my crippling loneliness is, it feels too real to be a hallucination. I don't know why but I just KNOW he's real. I can't explain it but it just is. Plus, I've seen people occasionally bump into him by accident and give out an exasperated “sorry” as they went back to walking to wherever they needed to be.

He never seemed to care of course. In fact, he didn't so much as glance back at them. He'd always just keep his eyes on me.

Anyways, the suggestion to look directly into the thing's face was enough to put me at ease. But, the idea of actually TALKING to it was terrifying. But, the more I thought about it, it couldn't hurt to try and reason with it. I mean, in all the days I've seen it, Mr. Blank hasn't done anything to try and hurt me (not yet anyway). So, today I decided to give it a shot. Besides, if he DID want to hurt me, he'd have to put in a lot of effort to get to me. On every occasion I’ve seen him, he's always outside or at a distance from me. The bastard would have to run a good couple yards to actually get to me and that’d be hard to do so through a giant crowd of people. Plus, nothing’s stopping me from just running away (despite my unhealthy lifestyle, I can be pretty fast with a good dose of adrenaline).

At about 12 am on a work day, I saw him sitting on a bench under a tree in the shade outside. I was in the office break room eating a giant bag of barbecue potato chips and saw him (as usual) out of the corner of my eye through the window adjacent to me. I remembered what noxy said and, to my chagrin, looked directly in his eyes and tried speaking to him with my thoughts. For a good five minutes I sat there staring at this thing. In my mind, I asked him various questions like “Who are you?” “What do you want with me?” “Are you a ghost or alien or something?” “Do you want to hurt me?”. And for every single question I asked, I got nothing but awkward silence. Mr. Blank just kept staring at me, with his little black beady eyes and thin moustache.

“You okay?” A voice in front of me asked.

I eventually snapped out of the attempt at a psychic transaction and saw one of my co-workers, Daniel, in front of me. With that came the realization of how fucking stupid I looked while doing my little staring contest with Mr. Blank.

“Mitch?” Daniel said with concern, “You good, bro?”

“Y-yeah!” I said, barely able to hide my shame, “ I'm fine.” 

“Cool, thought you were having a Vietnam flashback or something.” He said with a slight chuckle. I let out a little, fake laugh in response.

“Yeah haha, yeah…” I said under my breath.

After a couple seconds of awkward silence, Daniel walked over to the fridge to get his lunch. I wanted to crawl inside a hole at that very moment. How long was I just staring into nothingness? God, he must've thought I was nuts for a minute there.

Before I could wallow in my own embarrassment, I remembered another thing noxy said in their message. And, to my better judgment, I spoke up to Daniel once more.

“Hey, Daniel. Before you um…you see I need you to um… tell me something real quick.” I said, practically tripping over my own words. As you can tell, I've never been good at starting (or maintaining) conversations.

“Yeah, sure. What is it?” He said.

“Can you look out the window for me?” 

“Ok? Is there something cool out there?”

“Do you see that guy over there?” I said, nervously.

“Yeah I see a guy out there. And over there. And over there. There's a lot of guys outside, Mitch.” Daniel said jokingly. 

Daniel has always been one to casually crack jokes in any given situation. A lot of people liked him for that. He’s a light-hearted guy and a natural social butterfly. I both respect and envy him for it.

“No no no, do you see that one guy outside. The one on the bench over there.” I proceeded to point to Mr. Blank, still idly sitting on the bench under the tree. “Him! Do you see him?” I said.

“Uh yeah, I see him. That guy with the fancy suit on, right?”

“Yeah, him! Does he seem…weird to you?” I asked Daniel, with a sheepish tone.

“Not particularly, no. He just seems like a guy with a nice suit and killer mustache. I’d have to go meet him after work if he's still there. Maybe he’d give me some facial hair tips! Been trying to grow a stache for a while now!” Daniel said with a hardy chuckle. 

It was obvious he wasn't looking at the horrifying, misshapen being as I was.

“Uh, you know what, nevermind. Sorry.” I said as I proceeded to throw away the bag of chips I finished 5 minutes ago.

“Uh, ok. See you around Mitch!” He said as I shuffled away back to my cubicle.

Well, at least I know this thing isn't psychic. But now I’m worried one of my coworkers think I'm schizophrenic or something. Another thing to note is that other people seem to see Mr. Blank as a normal person and not a beady-eyed monster. But, on a side note, I'll only do my “experiments” with Mr. Blank in private to avoid having awkward conversations explaining away my odd behavior. I'll try to keep you guys updated on further developments concerning Mr. Blank. But, for now, I'll be signing out. Hopefully not for the last time.

Until then, wish me luck.
