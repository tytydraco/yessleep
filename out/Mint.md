"Arielle? Are you feeling okay?" 

"Hm? Yeah, I'm fine mom."

"Seems like I lost you there for a second!" She chuckled, tapping her fork on her plate as she scraped it clean.

How could she eat at a time like this? I could barely stomach her lies, I didn't have room for much more. 

Those robots I saw, those...people. Limp limbs, funerary faces, but the eyes were so real. I felt like they were all watching me, judging me as I shut the doors and locked them into the dark. 

Now, it seems like I can hear them beneath the floors, softly breathing, and the faintest sound of a heartbeat. 

"Just not hungry tonight. Cool if I bail?" 

"Of course, darling. Don't stay up too late!" 

I softly smiled at her, weary of what might happen when I decide to tell her. 

You know when you have a funny feeling that if you tell someone something, a series of unfortunate events will occur? 

That's how I felt, staring across from my mother. I feel like I'm staring across the table from a stranger. 

"I'll clean up." She commands, drawing me back to reality. I stand to my feet and nod, slow footfalls to my bedroom.

How could she do this to us?

How could she do this me? 

My heart was racing, I tried to keep myself from vomiting as I used the wall for purchase. 

I tried to rationalize it to myself. That it must be something I don't know about, some illness or disaster impending.

I told myself they were criminals, vagrants, but none of that made sense. 

They were just so...still. 

Hanging on the walls like morbid decorations. It almost made me laugh out of fear.

I never wanted to go back down there to see them, but I had to know the truth. 

How could she do this to us?

I waited until she went to bed, then slowly crept out of my bed to the basement. 

Each step I took felt like damnation, and I felt as if I could hear them calling my name. 

I quietly turned the lock, and stepped into the darkness with only my phone for illumination. 

The silence was deafening, and the contrast of the pristine white lab crossed liminal space territory. 

I had been here so many times. So why was I so scared?

Why didn't she tell me? 

I stood face to face to the barely visible door in the corner of the room, cleverly hidden behind a rack of books and manuals my mother had written. 

She always said she'd be a writer. 

Maybe she can write a book about this. 

My hands shook as I pushed the door open, the lights automatically turning on with my movements. 

They didn't even flinch. 

For a moment I just stared, hopeless for words. 

But I needed something I could take with me, concrete proof my mother was a...that she needed help. 

It was almost funny, it felt like a family reunion. 

Dad was to the left, with his head ever so crooked and eyes wide. 

My sister, Janice, was to the right of me, posed in a prayer, eyes focused on the sky. 

Aunt Mary, cousin Chaz, grandma and grandpa all resided here. 

But these weren't their bodies. They were shiny, robotic, mint condition.
