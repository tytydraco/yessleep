Whether through famine, hysteria or war, you could never really escape the fear of where the world was heading. Some would say it started in 2016, but most knew it had been building up for ages, some new disaster making the headlines every month. The current situation was the logical endpoint, a 2020 panicked by a global outbreak that wasn't even quelled by promise for a vaccine. As such, some pretty important events had to be shut down.

And that was where Alexandra Couls was now, in her apartment on October 31st, 2020. Normally she'd be enthusiastic to give out treats and candy to the younger Halloween loving tykes roaming the halls. But Halloween, at least in Alex's neighbourhood, had been called off for most thanks to the Pandemic. The years since high school had greatly dampened her idealism. Alexandra was a short, average-looking college student still struggling with student debt and mind-numbing assignments. Her circle of friends, especially Julia Brien, were dealing with life in their own ways. Julia was taller, more headstrong, and spoke her mind more. She practically doted on Alex to take the big risks most would back down from.

Alex's train of thought was interrupted as her cell rang. It was no surprise who it was. "Hey, girlfriend," Julia always wanted to sound sly.

"Happy Halloween, Julia. Sounds like you've got something to tell me again."

Julia chuckled. "Wouldn't call you if I didn't, Alex. And believe it or not, even I was nervous about this at first."

That was a worrying sign. Julia had a habit of getting into the weirdest crowds, but it was saying something if something unsettled her. Then again, Julia usually had something big to say when she called.

"Okay, Spill."

"You remember Cale from social studies?"

Cale was the resident oddball of Alex's college. He was a stringy and excitable man who'd usually announce his presence with a laugh or a yodel. There was word around campus he was a drug dealer, or at the least on something himself.

"Cale? The loner?"

"Yeah, the man, the myth. He's having a Halloween party tonight at 10:00, I bet it'll be interesting."

Alex snorted. "Just when I thought you had standards. You sure you want to spend Halloween getting high in the house of some guy you barely know? Besides, this couldn't be a worse year."

"Look, we're both vaccinated, aren't we? Besides, there'll probably be loads of masks at a damn Halloween party. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and you're gonna just blow it off out of fear?"

There it was. Alex knew how timid she could be compared to Julia, and it was a sore spot, especially with bigger social opportunities. Alex hated having that reputation and her friend knew it.

"Okay. You can come get me at 9:30 in the parking lot. If we get roofied though, I'll never forgive you."

Julia gave a nervous giggle. "Jeez, someone's in the Halloween spirit."

As the time drew near, Alexandra slipped into her costume, a part rubber, part felt Gargoyle suit with two plastic wings and a grinning papier mâché mask. She'd gotten the idea from the stories she'd heard about the stone beasts in that folklore course she took in February. It felt odd walking down the empty halls in the guise of a monster, while most were locked away in their own abodes. It made her feel just a bit more isolated.

In front of the building was a red hybrid driven by the Bride of Frankenstein. Julia looked like she'd stepped out of the silver screen.

"Wow, Impressive costume!"

"Gotta go with the classics. But what are you supposed to be?"

"I'm a Gargoyle, or as the French would say, "a grotesque".

They chattered like that most of the way to the party, and soon Alex was feeling less tense. Before long they were pulling in front of a small apartment flat, several partygoers already waiting around the lawn. It was kind of hard to believe Cale would have such a large friend circle.

Inside, the party was a mass of masked figures, anime characters, and fur suits, crowded inside Cale's living room. Chatting and laughing about college life, current events and general goofiness. To Alex it felt like stepping into a cross between Comic Con, a fur convention, and a 15th century masquerade ball. The guests continued mingling for a bit before a microphone thumped and then a voice called for attention.

All eyes turned to a miniature microphone stand near the large TV, where stood a figure clad in a red robe with a grinning skull-like mask. The Masque Of The Red Death. He removed the mask and there was Cale, hair scraggly, eyes wild and somewhat sunken.

"I'm touched y'all gave me a chance." He bleated his announcements, his voice as usual nervous and high pitched. "Granted I think some of you just came cuz you badly needed a place to get high."

A chuckle resonates through the room. Cale intoned, "well, you may think I'm just the local weed boy. But what I'm gonna show you tonight will change your world."

Beside her friend, Julia whispered, "Wonder what crazy shit he's gonna pull now," and Alex snorted. Cale didn't seem to notice, and he knew he often got that reaction anyway.

Then he reached into his robe pocket and drew out a small plastic bag of what seemed to be pink powder. "The stuff I have," he went on, "is a rare, highly hallucinogenic substance I picked up in China. They call it the Demon's Sweat."

Of course, should've known this would be the draw of the party. "And I'm offering a little challenge. Anyone here who takes this with me will be the first to take this stuff outside China."

An awkward murmuring ran through the guests. Was he nuts? Who'd be stupid enough to try? Under normal circumstance, Alex would tell him to fuck off. She'd barely talked to Cale before, and what he was saying reminded her why. Then she saw Julia raise her hand, along with several others.

"What are you doing?" Alex hissed.

"Remember what I said about taking risks?" Julia whispered back, "This is what I mean. A once in a lifetime experience, Allie. I don't know about you, but I want a story to tell my cousins."

Alex saw other hands go up, as if being invited to an exclusive social club. "I promise, the stuff is safe," Cale rambled. "I've taken some myself, and it feels pretty nice."

Before Alex realized, her hand joined the throng. Her curiosity had overrode her fear. Whatever this was, she just had to see for herself. Cale motioned down a hall left of his living room. Alex, Julia, and several other party goers followed him to an empty room with four bean bag chairs and posters of surreal artwork from the 70s/80s. In the middle of the room was a table with at least seven bags of the pink powder. A drug den? There was also a tea kettle and a few small cups on the left side. Cale sat cross legged, motioning the others to follow.

"You can each take the Demon's Sweat however you like, smoke it, sprinkle in your drink and such. But be careful, only in small doses." In the dim lighting, Cale's eyes seemed almost flaming.

Alex and Julia watched as the others began to take packets from the table, start wrapping the stuff into cigarettes. Julia shifted nervously, than took a bag, Alex following suit. Quietly, each poured herself a tea cup and sprinkled in a pinch of the powder.

"You still okay with this?" Alex asked. Julia glanced at the relaxing, certainly stoned guests.

"They seem okay. Happy Halloween!" She raised her cup and took a sip of tea. Alex watched as her friend exhaled happily, and lifted her tea to her lips.

The drink was warm and sweet, no different taste than the tea her Aunt Greta would make. Then as she sat there, Alex felt the world changing. The idle chatter of the partygoers dipped into... not gibberish, but some language not of human tongue. As they laughed and fell into the cushions, their tongues became slimy, barbed things. Their eyes glowed with unearthly colors, their bodies contorting. The shadows danced around the room, forming monstrous shapes in turn. Some had several long legs, or anteater snouts or glider-like wings.

And yet... Alex didn't react, couldn't even think. She wasn't herself. The thing that lived in her gibbered greetings to its kind, the guests gibbering back. This was the last Alex saw before she fell unconscious.

It was a bleary light she awoke to. As her eyes adjusted, Alex realized she was in bed at home. The clock on the nightstand read 4:31 AM. Goddamn, she'd kill Julia for this*.* Some Halloween, letting the local nutbag feed you weird shit he bought across the globe. She was too dazed to wonder who brought her back. She brushed her hair aside and headed to the bathroom for a shower. Needed to get a headstart to campus.

After a good warm soaking, she stepped out, wrapped a towel around herself-and froze. Something was written on the mirror. *Hello my host.*

Alex suddenly felt sick, like something had kicked her gut. She wasn't alone. Struggling to remain calm and scrabbling to find a weapon, her mind raced. How could she get out with some creep prowling in her apartment?

Just then, a voice–no, a thought called to her. *Calm down, Alex. Nobody broke in.* In spite of herself, the girl felt a bit calmer.

But wait, that didn't feel like her mind. It was like someone used her head as a speaker.

*I'm afraid that's right, Hun. Don't want you thinking you're crazy.* This time she knew that wasn't her. What was happening? Was she losing her mind?

Almost immediately the voice spoke. *Please don't think that. I'm real and I can prove it.* And as it did, those same words appeared on the foggy mirror as if scrawled by an invisible hand.

Shaking, Alex found her voice: "What are you? Why are you in my head?"

*Tell me,* the entity replied, *do you remember last night? I chose you as host. As my brethren do every few decades.*

Feeling a little emboldened, Alex strode out of the bathroom to get dressed, still talking to the unseen being. "What the hell do you mean, is this that drug?"

The voice reverberated in her head, *I guess you could say that. The dust you ingested links our essence to the physical world. Every so often, at a most chaotic time, we bond with humans to anchor ourselves. What better time than a night of spirits and magic dating all the way back to the Celts?*

Alex was still taking all this in. "So if you're real... can't you show me what you look like?"

There was a reverberating sort of noise like laughter. *Oh I can't do that yet, might destroy your mind. But I can do other things.*

With that there was a strange feeling in the air, like it was getting warmer. Then as she watched, a red, green, orange mist began to form in the room, shaping and coalescing until it became a cloud, the same shape and height of her own figure.

*Making sense yet?*

*"* I guess." Alex didn't actually know how to react to this.

The cloud-double made the impression of a smile, speaking in tune with the words of the alien voice. *I have no name yet, unless you choose. But I still have things to show you.*

The apparition strode to the door leading to Alex's balcony and through some impossible force, opened it. Alex walked into the morning air... and nearly fainted. The world outside was normal, but she could see things that were never there. Serpentine shapes sailed the skies. Colourful, powerfully-built humanoids leapt from roof to roof. Massive creatures out of an alien sea strolled through the streets unnoticed. It was like overnight the city had become a melting pot of beings from other dimensions.

*It has always looked like this,* the cloud being explained*, just not to humans like you. Our kind has walked the earth on a different plain. We can only manifest in certain times like last night. Still skeptical? Perhaps you should call your friend.*

Alex suddenly remembered Julia, surely, she wasn't going through this too? Nervously, Alex took her phone from the nightstand and brought up her friend's number. The voice was Julia's, but not how Alex normally heard.

"H-Hello?"

"It's me...Alex. You, okay?"

"Oh god, Ally, I think I'm going nuts. This *thing* is talking to me, I'm seeing monsters outside. It was that fucker Cale and his powder-"

Alex tuned out briefly before piping up. "Okay, calm down. I'm seeing this too. Just stay there and we'll sort this out."

Julia hastily but reluctantly agreed, and Alex was once again alone except for the presence in her mind. *So what shall my name be?*

With a sigh, Alex vindicated the unwelcome being. "How about...Trips? That's what I thought you were at first,"

The cloud-being shifted and warped with joyful laughter. *We'll be good friends. But I must warn you of something else.*

"Oh god, what?" Alex groaned.

*Once we bond with a host, we must consume the energy of another demon to complete the fusion. If not before the end of November, demon and host will burn out and die.*

"What the fuck. Okay, now that you've told me how I'll die, what am I supposed to do?"

Don't worry, Cale will call us to help when that time comes. For now, I really want to see this world with you by my side.

Alex had lost the ability to feel surprised anymore, all in one morning. Stepping into the world of monsters and walking nightmares, she constantly told herself to keep focused, even if it was hard to ignore the things that rode the subway or flew over the roofs. It was easy to forget the current pandemic when there were giant monsters having tea over apartment roofs, or little lizard-monkeys riding people's heads.

And yet, only Alex was aware of such wonders, and she knew it was thanks to that damned dust she'd consumed on Halloween. Trips, meanwhile, would often be chatting away to its fellow creatures in that strange way.

The three days seemed to slip by. Alex and Julia didn't have much time to talk, but Alex did meet her own monster: a blue humanoid cloud shaped like its host, just as with her own entity. Trips seemed to get on fine with it and the two girls watched the creatures chatter to each other from their seats by the coffee shop window.

Julia was getting a bit more despondent. "I called up some of the others and this is happening to them too." She sighed bitterly. "Cale...that piece of shit....I'm sorry I dragged you into this."

Alex smiled. "Don't be. This would be cool... if it weren't for the impending doom."

"What?" Julia whispered harshly.

Alex suddenly realized what her girlfriend didn't know. Julia whipped around to look at the two creatures.

"WHAT?!" She bellowed loud enough to alert the entire shop, human or otherwise. The blue being seemed to flinch, and tried to explain the situation in a way that only her host understood. "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?" Evidently, she no longer cared about the public space.

As eyes turned to Julia, she stormed to the doors. Alex along with Trips followed outside. "Jules, calm down"

"How are you so calm? Do you even care what'll happen to us!?" The girl was trying to lower her voice but it wasn't easy given the circumstances. Alex had felt the same way.

"I do," she said sadly, "but at the same time, I was relieved in a way."

Julia's face was quiet amazement. "Life was starting to feel aimless, uncertain and dull. But then we get shown this whole new world of things we thought couldn't exist. Even if it's scary, existentially terrifying, it's still a purpose."

Julia flatly replied, "What kind of world are you seeing? Because all I see are dumb animals idly going about while the bigger beasts gobble them up. That's you and me, Ally." Her eyes were cold. "If I'm gonna be stuck with this thing, I'm not going to be served up like a stuffed pig. Are you?" For the first time, Julia was serious about something. Alex couldn't remember the last time since middle school.

Soon Friday came, as did the phone calls. It was Cale, summoning them to his house of horror, where it had all began. Just as Trips had said.

That night as Alex pulled up to the ominous house, she heard Trips' advice. *You realize* *we are about to face a turning point. Be strong, Alex, and we will come out of this stronger.* Alex wasn't sure she could be optimistic about that.

Several gargoyle-like phantoms watched from their rooftop perches as the guests packed into Cale's house. The young man was waiting for them, his eccentric stoner persona given way to that of a mad sorcerer. It was clear he was one with a demon himself.

"As you all know," he announced, "The Demon's Sweat changed your lives. Some of you may hate me, but I only served a greater calling, as you all do now. You have unthinkable power, and tonight you will learn to control it."

Indeed, nobody seemed to want to be here. The strange substance that this... maniac had fed them leashed these invisible beasts to their souls, and this bizarre ritual was the only way to control the power.

Cale motioned to the basement door and announced, "The Duel of Souls will commence down here." There were some nervous chuckles. In any normal situation, these RPG titles would be funny.

The small crowd of humans and entities trailed downstairs to a wide den. Cale announced, "One pair each will take part in this ritual. The winner has the strongest spirit and walks away with newfound energy. The loser... .I appreciate your efforts."

Nobody liked the sound of that, but they had no choice if they were to ease this curse.

Two boys stepped forth. A medium one and a big burly guy. The smaller boy grinned in anticipation at his opponent, who glowered. And with a word from Cale, the full horror of the night unfolded.

The two stood opposite each other before doubling over and screaming, their bodies changing. The small one's forehead erupted into two hornlike protrusions, his tiny frame bursting with muscle, fur sprouting from his shoulders, hands merging into three fingered appendages. The big guy's skin rapidly grew coral like lesions, his hands large bony claws, his teeth elongated, and his face twisted into a saurian snout. Their own demons had taken form through the host. Where two young men stood were two hulking abominations, a shimmering orange golem of coral and a powerfully built horned ape, a Minotaur.

Some of the onlookers screamed in shock, but no one made a move, because they knew leaving wasn't an option. The beasts howled and lunged at each other, the coral-man's hands forming into shapes that engulfed his foe's fist. The Bull was strong and sturdy but even he couldn't match the shifting mass that grew and clung to his arms, even as he crushed it like chalk.

The Coral-Beast was forming himself around his foe, engulfing him in a mass of expanding alien mineral. The Minotaur roared and thrashed, smashing with his titanic arms and horns, but the living substance kept forming, closing in like sediment around fossilized bones. Then the Coral-Beast opened his grinning maw, engulfing his prey's head to smother the defiant shrieks.

Then it was his turn to scream. The orange mass around the Bull-Ape's head sizzled and crumbled away. A steaming green liquid frothed from the Ape's jaws and ate away at those of his crystallized enemy. The ape continued to spew the foul acid as the alien rock eroded and emitted a horrible, vibrating scream. Whatever it was, it felt pain like any animal. The Bull triumphantly broke free of the coral tomb and smashed his beefy fists against the shattered form of his foe, again, again, and howled in triumph as the being lay in rubble around him. In seconds, his form shrunk, reverted to the timid young man who'd first entered the fight. The coral fragments evaporated.

This was the basis of each fight. Everyone here had to consume another's essence to control their new powers. The only rule was nobody could leave the psychic circle where the fight took place. And it went on like that the rest of the night. Bodies twisted and morphed into things never seen on Earth. A crawling faceless thing with Jellyfish tendrils whipped electric shocks at a monstrous reptile with a large shell. A hulking green scaled abomination locked arms with a four armed red brute. Each match ended in one crumbling to ash and the other renewed yet weary from victory.

Alex saw Julia become her demon for the first time, a spindly blue insectoid with fierce jaws. Its armored limbs locked with a bat winged creature. The two rose into the air before Julia's proboscis shot through the bat's eye and sent them tumbling back down. Within seconds the clawing, screeching beast fell limp as the thing that was Julia sucked its fluids through a socket.

As the beast crumbled, the blue beetle shrunk and became Julia again. She seemed shocked, but exhilarated.

"That felt...good. I know it's wrong, but I've never felt anything like it...God, what the fuck am I?"

Trips' voice rang in: *It's our turn, Ally.*

"I know." Alex said it numbly, bluntly. Not like she had a choice. Nothing would ever surprise her again after tonight, if she lived past it.

Her opponent stepped in. A girl about her age, with dark eyes and a rugged grimace. Alex wondered if she'd had her own issues before that night. "Uh...good luck?," Cringeworthy.

The other gave a grim smirk. "I really should say that to you."

*Don't be intimidated. She is as nervous as you.* Alex wasn't sure she found Trips' words helpful. They were the last match of the night. Most of the other combatants had left to take in their new lives. Only Julia and four others stayed to watch the grim initiation.

The two girls faced each other as before. The oddly assuring voice of Trips piped up. *Don't worry. I'll take over from here. Just relax. Think of it like the dentist.* Worst analogy ever.

Alex's foe was named Talia. As Trips gleaned, she'd been drawn here by desperation for a purpose, something greater from life, and she'd thrilled at the chance to transcend.

Finally it began. Talia's body expanded, her arms splitting into four. Her face contorted and split into two, each shrieking with painfully forced jaws. Legs became spiny and rigid like a mantis. Skin turned gray and rough like tree bark. And each hand was now formed into an organic weapon.

But Alex wasn't there. Trips was there, their body forming into Alex's. Her mouth became a sharp beak. Her hands grew into powerful paws as huge jagged wings extended outward. And a sort of lichen formed on the being's face and torso. The new beast rose to fight. Alex had once been a gargoyle in costume, but Trips was the thing that inspired such statues.

The Talia-beast slashed and hacked at Trips, its blades failing to pierce Trips' now stone-like body. Trips shot back with powerful armored punches. A flurry of snarling, biting, clawing, centered in that room, each locked in a battle of mental fortitude to consume the other.

Talia-Beast sprayed something from its mouths, a blinding gas that sizzled on Trips' stone flesh. As it howled, Talia-Beast took the upper hand, pouncing like a tiger to an elk. Four claws dug into stone flesh, ripping into the fallen gargoyle's hide.

But Trips wasn't out. Small tendrils shot from the holes in its armor, latching to its assailant. And in that moment, Alex became aware of her mind flowing to meet Talia's. In a space cut off from the physical world, two girls became linked by soul.

As Alex "stared" upon Talia's visage, she truly understood who she faced. Talia was trapped by addiction, rarely came home, hated the family who didn't understand or respect her. This was a way out, a new beginning. The two gazed silently, sadly, as Talia's very being became one with Alexandra's. To the outside world it was a horrific predation, but within Talia's troubled soul became tranquil and calm for the first time in years, becoming one with Alexandra.

Talia and her demon were one with Trips and Alex now. *How do you feel?*

"Fine."

It was odd how casual she said it, but Trips was satisfied. Soon reality came back into view, as the monster morphed back to a young woman. Talia was gone, but Alex knew she was part of her now. Two had become one, a new being ready to face a daunting future.

Cale was smiling. "Welcome to a new world, our disciple."

A few days passed since that night. There were still missing posters plastered on bulletin boards and telephone poles for the losers of those matches. It would have alarmed most, but Alexandra and Julia knew the truth.

In fact, each of the missing were one with their "killers". Humans and demons alike are reborn through the absorption process, creating stronger, better entities. Alex was now four in one vessel, as were all the remaining guests.

As she looked out from her rooftop perch at the world only visible to her kind, Trips said, *You know this doesn't change much. We'll have to go about our life for now.*

Alex smiled to herself. "I know. But Julia's taking it well. And I can do all the things Talia wanted to but couldn't." It was Talia speaking, two minds merged into a new being.

*Well,* Trips said, *I'd enjoy it while you can. Soon there'll be another ceremony, more humans will join your numbers.*

"Evolution can be a scary thing. But people are never prepared for change. It's always been like that, even with the most beneficial."

*You sure handled it better than most humans,* Trips said slyly. *Maybe this time will be different.*

"We should see for ourselves."

And with that, the new being's wings unfolded and she flew to a changing world.
