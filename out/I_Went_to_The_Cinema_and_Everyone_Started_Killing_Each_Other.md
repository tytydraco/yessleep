It was Saturday night and a friend and I were planning to go and see this new horror film.

It was supposed to revolutionize the genre, and in a way, it succeeded.

We settled into our seats after paying for our tickets and grabbing some popcorn each. Our seats were a little too far to the left for my taste, but at least we were placed in the middle.

The cinema was full. They had invested a lot in marketing the film, and it had worked. In fact, we were lucky to manage to get seats at all, because the other three theaters were already full when we arrived.

While waiting for the film to start, Elena, my friend, told me what she'd read about the film's reviews. The critics had called it the “film of the year” and a “new benchmark” in the horror genre. Little had leaked about the film's content, which was pretty incredible for the time.

Fun fact: the film's director was born right here in my town. He had even worked every summer in this very cinema. To mark the occasion, he decided to let people see his film here 24 hours before the rest of the world.

As a result, everyone in the theater seemed very excited. I just hoped people would behave like civilized people and not like animals during the screening.

My phone buzzed just as the movie started. It was my mom calling.

“Fuck, I need to take this,” I said, rising from my seat with my back bent.

“But the film is starting!” Elena said in a whisper, sounding outraged, as if I were committing sacrilege. In my opinion, she'd read a few too many articles about the film. I thought it was going to be as revolutionary as “Saw”. Cool, but nothing revolutionary.

“You can tell me who died when I get back,” I said, smiling.

Once in the corridor, I answered the phone and my mother, who wanted to “just have a word with me”, ended up giving me a 10-minute monologue about my father's new girlfriend, even though they'd just gotten divorced. “Just divorced” actually meant 3 years ago.

“Listen Mom, I've got to get back I was at the movies with Elena, let's talk later okay?”

I went back into the theater. I silently excused myself to the few people sitting in the row before I could get to my seat. They acted as if I didn't exist, and seemed to be staring at the screen without even blinking. The film must have been exciting.

“Did I miss something?” I asked Elena, sitting back down next to her.

She didn't reply. She continued to stare at the screen, and I swear, even after I jokingly waved my hand in front of her eyes to get her to look at me, she hadn't moved, reacted or even blinked. She seemed to be in a state.

I was starting to freak out. I looked around and saw that the whole room was in the same state.
It was deathly silent, apart from the film that was still playing on the screen. People didn't even move their eyes, they were like statues, their backs straight and their chests slightly forward, staring at the screen in a single stare.

“Elena, Elena what the fuck answer me!” I ended up almost shouting.

She didn't react, and nobody around me told me to shut up either.

Sweat was now starting to accumulate above my eyebrows. What the fuck was going on? The film couldn't be so exciting as to turn them all into zombies.

The fact that I was the only person in the room who still seemed “normal” began to worry me. What if something had happened to them and they were targeting me because I was “different” from them?

The music that had been hovering in the room to build tension during one of the scenes suddenly stopped with a violent fiddle blast, and I gasped as I looked at the screen.

Only the bloodshot eyes of a man, whom I assumed to be the killer in the film, was visible on the screen.

The camera slowly lowered to his lips.

“Now.You kill.”

Suddenly, the room came alive.

Some people were starting to stand up, others were contorting themselves oddly in the seat. Still others held their faces in their hands and pulled their skin as if to remove a mask that didn't exist.

People started screaming guttural cries from deep inside.

Then the blood began to flow.

People were attacking each other. I saw two women break another woman's arm. A man had jumped on a woman's throat and bitten so hard that blood was spurting from her neck. Further on, two men were pulling a man's arm apart. Others didn't seem to have found a victim and were attacking their own bodies as if by a self-destructive mechanism.

I was paralyzed with fear, my lips and jaw trembling and tears forming in my eyes. I had dug my fingernails into the seat under my legs to keep myself from screaming and being spotted by these people. Could they still be called that?

“Elena we need to get the fuck out of her,” I whispered, sobbing.

I'd forgotten she was “one of them”. In my head I still had someone, an ally, someone to rely on in this sudden madness. But she was gone too.

I looked back at her. She was tearing off her own fingers with her teeth.

Then she turned her head towards me, and tried to jump on me. I pushed her away and threw myself to the ground. In the confusion I started to crawl towards the side corridor so I could get the hell out of here. The people above me seemed so immersed in madness that they weren't even paying attention to what was going on below them.

After receiving several drops of blood on my face, I finally made it to the other side and sprinted towards the door a little further up.

The way out of this nightmare was right there, I was going to make it.

The door swung open under my momentum.

I looked around.

I felt as if I were in a carnage scene from a zombie movie.

Clearly, the spectators in the other rooms had also gone berserk, and some had come out and attacked the other spectators in the cinema, including the staff.

I went down the stairs to the ticket counter and saw corpses of employees on the floor, some injured but still alive, their eyes wide open as if unable to process what was happening.

I was watching one man shove his entire arm down another's throat when someone called out to me from a distance.

“Girl, come here, come here!”

A man in a janitor's outfit was calling me from behind the counter, inside what appeared to be a cleaning closet. He waved me over and I realized he was offering me a place to hide. I ran into the small room just as the doors of the room I'd just left exploded before a new crowd of enraged people.

As soon as I entered, the concierge closed the door and double-locked it.

We stayed in the dark to avoid being spotted by them as much as possible. We called the police and told them there was a riot with several dead at the cinema, without going into too much detail so they wouldn't think it was a hoax.

After a while, a siren went off in the distance, followed by many others. Screams, a few gunshots.

Two hours later the situation was under control, and men with assault rifles and bloody body armor pulled us out.

I didn't dare look at anything but my feet as I left the cinema.

The incident hit the news like a bombshell.

As all the evidence from the few survivors, including myself, was that the film seemed to have been the cause of all this, the police immediately questioned the director, producer and rest of the film crew.

Turns out what was revolutionary about their film was actually a form of temporary hypnosis applied through subliminal images and sound in the opening minutes of the film.

This hypnosis was supposed to make the film “even more realistic”, placing viewers in a state of quasi-participation in their minds. Numerous tests were successfully carried out before the screening. Even the critics didn’t see anything, and experienced the desired effect of hypnosis, which is why they praised it so highly.

What they hadn't anticipated were the effects of projecting and hypnotizing mass audiences of excited people. The effect had been multiplied and the crowd had created a paranoia effect and a state of total trance that finally exploded when the film's killer seemed to order them to kill.

In the end, Elena pulled through, and a transplant gave her back partial use of her hand. She took it positively, telling herself that, like many others, she could have died.

I got through it with therapy.

In any case, if you ever hear of a “revolutionary” horror film, my advice is to wait and see what viewers think.

At worst, you'll be able to avoid a film that has been over-rated by the critics, at best you'll keep your head in its place and all your fingers.
