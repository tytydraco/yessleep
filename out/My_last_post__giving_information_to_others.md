  

Hello to anyone reading this, I think this will be my last time on the internet. I need to go off-grid and disappear because I've made some very powerful people angry. So I will leave this as a record. Let me start off by saying that I have always been an atheist and skeptical about the supernatural. Therefore, I believe whatever happened to me has a naturalistic explanation.

About three years ago, I was walking home after a night out celebrating my completion of a Ph.D. in physics. The night was dark and misty, with the streetlights casting eerie shadows on the empty sidewalks. I felt a buzz of excitement and relief at having finished my degree, but also a twinge of sadness at leaving behind the academic community that had become my second family. I took a deep breath of the chilly air, savoring the freedom of being able to choose my own path.

Suddenly, a car careened around the corner and slammed into me. The impact sent me flying through the air, my body hitting the pavement with a sickening thud. Pain exploded in every nerve, and I could barely breathe. I felt blood trickling down my face and tasted the metallic tang of it on my lips. As I struggled to stay conscious, I heard the sound of the car screeching away into the night.

I tried to move, but my body wouldn't obey. I felt a cold fear creeping up my spine, as I realized that I might not make it. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a figure approaching me. It was glowing with an otherworldly light, and at first, I thought it was a hallucination caused by my injuries. But as it drew closer, I could see that it was real.

The figure knelt down beside me, and I saw that its face was blank and featureless. It held out a hand, and I felt a strange compulsion to take it. As I did, I felt a surge of energy coursing through my body, knitting my broken bones back together and staunching the flow of blood. I was amazed and terrified at the same time, wondering what kind of being could have such power.

The figure leaned closer to me, and I felt its breath on my face. It smelled like rotten meat and mold, and I retched at the stench. But then it opened its mouth, revealing rows of sharp teeth, and poured a viscous liquid down my throat. The taste was bitter and acrid, and I wanted to spit it out, but I couldn't move.

As the liquid flowed through me, I felt a strange sense of euphoria and detachment. It was like my mind was floating above my body, observing everything from a distance. I saw the figure stand up and disappear into the shadows, and I felt a sense of dread settling over me. What had I just been given? And at what cost?

When I woke up the next day, I was lying at the bottom of the incline where I had fallen, fully healed with a clear memory of the previous night. It was like a vivid dream, but the torn clothes and scrapes on my body told me it was real. I searched the area for any sign of the figure, but there was nothing. I tried to rationalize what had happened, but the memory of the glowing figure and the bitter liquid haunted me. I told myself that it must have been some kind of hallucination caused by my injuries, but deep down, I knew that wasn't the truth. And now, as I write this, I can't shake the feeling that there's something inside me, something that wasn't there before.

Months went by without anything strange happening, so I thought maybe it was just a weird dream. But then I got a phone call from the family of my Ph.D. supervisor. She was dying of cancer, and we suspected it would happen soon. She wanted to keep working as much as possible to finish her projects before it was too late, so I went to see her in the hospital.

When I arrived, she looked very sick, and we spoke for hours. We talked about her projects and reminisced about our time working together. I felt sad that she was dying, but I also felt a strange energy building inside me as we talked.

Before I left, I touched her hand, and something strange happened. The same power that I had felt when I was hit by the car and healed by the glowing figure flowed into her, and I knew something wasn't right. I felt a sudden surge of energy leaving me and entering her body, and she seemed to become more alert and lively.

As I left the hospital, strange whispers filled my ears, and I couldn't ignore them. The whispers seemed to be coming from all around me, and they were so faint that I could barely make out what they were saying. They followed me home, and I heard creaking and rustling noises that made my skin crawl. I felt like I was being watched, and the whispers seemed to be getting louder.

I tried to forget about it, but the whispers kept getting louder, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming for me. I didn't know what the whispers meant, but I felt like I was in danger. I started seeing strange shadows out of the corner of my eye and felt like I was being followed wherever I went.

A few weeks later, I heard through the grapevine that my supervisor had made a complete recovery. Despite my initial fear of what had happened, a small part of me couldn't help but feel happy to have been able to help her in some way. However, I was still too scared to reply to her texts or phone calls. At this point, the dark figures and the whispering had essentially stopped, and I wondered if I had some kind of power to heal people. But I was still worried about the potential consequences, until my sister's child got sick. They had a bad liver defect and were given only months to live. I went to visit my sister and have dinner with them. Before I left, I ruffled the child's hair as I said goodbye, and the same zapping sensation happened again. As I left, I felt the shadows and the whispering come back, but stronger this time. The hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I could feel the presence of something watching me. The smell of fear filled my nostrils, acrid and bitter. I tasted dread in my mouth, dry and dusty. It was as if the shadows were alive, breathing down my neck and surrounding me with an unseen presence. I drove home, mostly scared but also feeling a sense of relief that I might have helped the child. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that the figures I had seen that night of the car accident were somehow connected to all of this.

Over the next few weeks, the child's condition improved beyond anyone's expectations. The doctors were amazed at the progress the child had made and my sister and her wife were overjoyed to see their little one running around happily. However, the more I used my powers to heal, the stronger the shadows and whispers became.

When I visited my sister for dinner, she asked if anything was wrong. I reassured her that everything was fine, but I could tell that she was still concerned. As I left her house, I felt a familiar zapping sensation when I ruffled the child's hair. The shadows and whispers returned, stronger than ever before. I couldn't shake off the feeling that the dark figures from the night of the car accident were somehow connected to all of this.

Late that night, I returned home to find a mysterious man in a suit standing outside my house. He wore sunglasses even though it was dark, and I couldn't make out his expression. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I wondered who he was and what he wanted. Was he connected to the shadows and whispering that had plagued me since I first used my powers? I watched him until he finally left, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered long after he was gone.

The next day, a loud knock echoed through my small apartment. I stumbled out of bed, still groggy from sleep, and shuffled to the door. When I opened it, five tall men in matching suits and sunglasses stood in the hallway, their faces stern and unyielding. Before I could even utter a word, they lunged forward, their strong arms grabbing me by the shoulders and dragging me into a waiting van. The air inside the vehicle was stale and suffocating, and the leather seats were rough against my skin. The men refused to answer my questions, only staring at me in eerie silence as the van rumbled on for hours.

Eventually, we pulled up to a massive mansion, and the men hustled me through the ornate front doors. They took me to a bedroom where an old man lay on an enormous four-poster bed, his skin pale and waxy. The room was opulent and grand, with thick red curtains drawn tightly over the windows and a chandelier overhead casting flickering shadows on the walls. An attendant, dressed in a black suit and white gloves, strode in and explained my task. I had been brought here to heal the old man, and I had no choice but to comply. His threat was clear: if I didn't, everyone I knew would be in danger.

I approached the bed and placed my trembling hand on the old man's forehead. A jolt of electricity surged through my body, and the room seemed to pulse with energy. The old man's breathing grew more steady, and I could feel the life force returning to him. But before I could finish, something heavy struck me from behind, and the room spun wildly. Pain ripped through my skull, and the world went black.

When I came to, I was alone in the room, the old man nowhere to be seen. The shadows and whispers were stronger now, an ominous presence that seemed to seep into my bones. The room felt colder and more menacing, the air thick with malevolent energy. I knew I had to escape, but the thought of facing those men again filled me with dread.

As the men in black suits returned with the attendant, the atmosphere in the room grew even more tense. The attendant revealed that in order to ensure the safety of my loved ones, I had to heal more people. But before I could even ask who they were, the men in black suits suddenly screamed in agony, their bodies being ripped apart by dark shadows emerging from the walls. The attendant tried to make a run for it, but the shadows caught up to him, tearing him apart limb by limb. The screams of the men and the attendant echoed throughout the mansion, as I watched in horror, wondering what kind of power I had unleashed.

After the carnage had stopped, I slowly made my way through the mansion, the only sounds I could hear were my own footsteps and the occasional creaking of the floorboards. It seemed like everyone inside the mansion had been killed by the shadows, including some of the most wealthy and powerful government officials in the country. I couldn't help but wonder why they were all here to get healed, and what kind of danger they were facing. I felt my heart racing as I tried to piece together what had just happened.

Feeling overwhelmed, I quickly left the mansion and located the keys to the van, desperate to get out of there. As I drove home, my mind raced with thoughts of what was going to happen next. I knew I had to disappear and keep my family and friends out of harm's way, but I didn't know how long we could hide. I also wondered what the news would say about the mass killing at the mansion and whether the authorities would try to cover it up.

I have just finished packing my bags, The dark figure is always around me now, I couldn't see it, but I know it is there, watching my every move.  I don’t know what it wants from me or what its goal is, but I know it is dangerous, and I can feel it standing behind me as I type this. I just hope this information can help someone.
