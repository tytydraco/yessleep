They say marriage has its ups and downs. 

Sort of almost like a roller coaster in a way.  First the ride starts; which usually is when you put the ring on her finger and have your honeymoon anywhere you both wanted to go. Then you would have your twists and turns; the small occasional arguments, when neither of you have the time to spend with each other like you used to, a few nights of you sleeping on the couch. 

After you get through them little bumps the ride will then go its long way up a hill. Small gifts or romantic acts that make it feel like the start again. How you and that beautiful barista would then try for a deeper level of intimacy.  

Then it happens like most roller coasters that you get scared of; the sudden drop off. 

My wife Mary as she'll be named here. Had suffered a miscarriage about a couple of months ago. Doctors couldn't explain what went wrong just that it sometimes “just happens”, which i think is just bs. She's currently been going through the grieving stage. 

She's closed off almost all her friends even though they still keep contact through me because I know she really doesn't resent them. 

There are countless nights when she couldn't sleep or had a hard time just sleeping peacefully. I would hear her softly crying or even mumbling to herself that it was all her fault. She would then calm down after I would comfort her. 

The strangest thing about all of this though was our nursery. Before what happened we made one of our spare rooms in our house into a nursery. Most of the stuff in there we got were gifts from friends oh her baby shower. We painted the walls pink where we were expecting a girl. 

We even had a pink crib and all. Along with a baby monitor that sits right by it. 

A few times I would catch Mary just standing almost blank face in the nursery. Most nights she would even sleep there. A friend of mine named John told me that it doesn't sound like weird behavior. Or what we thought of it at the time. 

She's lost about a few pounds in this time period. I have to force her to eat a snack or few just to keep her from going frail. I didn't want to lose two people I love in the same year. 

Whenever I met my wife she always had a thing for painting these beautiful art pieces. Hell, for one of our dates at her place she even painted a picture of me that she still has hung up in her studio. She hardly goes there anymore but to remind myself sometimes why I am doing this I would go in there and just look through all of them. 

One day a week or so ago while flipping through her paintings I found one that seemed a little off and to me at the time somewhat frightening. 

The background colors were in a darkish blue pallet. Almost swirled in a way where you think it was in a storm. It looked almost skeletal. Dark hollowed sunken in eyes with boney frailed arms that look like it's trying to reach out at you. It's face almost seemed like it had been crying. 

Of course after seeing this I took it too her and see what it was. 

She told me she didn't paint that piece. That some old woman from a yard sale that happened last fall had sold it to her. Saying she had spotted my wife's “artistic talent” seeping through her. Called the painting “Wail of Sorrow”. 

At first I was shocked by the details about the painting but it gave me hope because Mary was actually talking about it and not giving me a few sentences. 

She then took the painting from me like she didn't even want me holding it. 

“At least let me have something I can actually hold that's mine” 

I was shocked and stunned by that comment. I was her husband yet it seemed like she wasn't even caring about me at all at that second. All the things I did for her to help her back to good health seemed out of the blue. 

Of course I got mad. I snapped saying a few things that I regretted and left the house. 

Later after a few beers I realized that I was in the wrong and came back to say I was sorry. When I entered the door she was no longer in the living room but the nursery. She had a hammer and few nails and was hanging the creepy painting up on the walls. 

She said it was to mark it as a sad moment for our lives and that she wanted to try to move forward. 

I was overjoyed to say the least

The next couple of days she seemed to be the happiest she had ever been. Her color in her eyes started to return and she even seemed to be smiling more. We even had a night of intimacy that she initiated which never happened for months. 

But lately it seems as if this happiness of hers is almost smuggling. She wouldn't stop asking me for things or go a few minutes without some form of contact. 

When she was out with friends they would tell me that she wouldn't stop asking about me. How I was and how I was doing. Almost like she was an entirely new person than what she used to be. 

As if that isn't enough the nursery seems to be creeping me out more.  

Every time I would walk by it I would have a smile on my face and eventually frown the second I step by the doorway. I've gotten shudders as it would feel like cold temperatures going through it. 

But my wife seems entirely unbothered by it. 

It's become almost routine now of her standing in there looking at the painting. She would mutter affirmations to herself. Once I think I've heard her even say that she wanted to try for a baby again. 

To me I think it's too soon and whenever we were talking about it one night while getting intimate she slapped me. Hard enough to even draw blood which wasn't even like her. 

The worst part was she still went through with sex. Not even caring what she had done to me. 

The next day she was still smiling as she fixed my favorite breakfast and called it an apology. She had a big long terrifying grin when she served me a plate. But the smell was so good that I hadn't had a proper breakfast in a while. 

Later that night she tried to have sex again, still having that grin on her face. 

I almost said no but remembered what happened the other night and just went along with what she wanted. She claimed it was the best night she ever had while I almost felt…dirty in a way. 

Now its too the point where I miss how sad my wife was. 

The peaceful nights of sleep I can have without her hitting or yelling at me. Where she would be in a different room in her own space.

I almost want something bad to happen again. 

I just don't know what to do. 

My head is coming up with thoughts I know that I shouldn't be having. 

One day I even put a little bit of rat poison over her breakfast as she was using the bathroom. She just ate it like it was nothing. Still with that big horrible grin. 

This is why I'm here 

What suggestions do you have for someone in my case.

How do I make her stop smiling again. 

Any suggestion you have I'll do it. 

I just want things to be the same again.
