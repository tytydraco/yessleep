Before i tell you my story, let me introduce you to myself and familiarize you with the situation i am in. You can call me Elli, i am not gonna give you my real name for privacy reasons. I live in a small not so well known town in Russia, where i lived all of my life up to this point. I won't mention town by name, for privacy reasons also, and because i don't want my town to become a some sort of paranormal tourist trap. I live in an apartment building with my pet cat. Throughout my life i experienced many weird things, and i thought i could share them with you and maybe tell you about my life in general. This feels like a perfect place to tell my stories. I am warning you, these tales are true, and i am lucky that i am still here to tell them. If people will find interest in my tales, i would be happy to share more.

Let's start off with explaining my day to day life. Like i said before, i live in an apartment complex, a common place for people to live in Russia. I live in a very quiet neighborhood, a very comfy place to live in where there is everything very close by. There's three different stores, a pizza restaurant, a mall very close by, and i also live next to a hospital. I own a one room apartment, i have a kitchen, a room i sleep in, and a bathroom. I live on 7th floor, and my building has only 9 floors, so i am living pretty high up. Why do i tell you this? Because recently, something happened to me that i could not find a logical explanation for, even if i try. 

Everything started several days ago. It was approximately 11pm, and i was about to go to bed, but i had to go drink water and check if i have food for breakfast. That's when i noticed a strange person standing across the road from my house from my kitchen window. He didn't move an inch, and despite him standing under a street light i couldn't make out his features. It's not common for folks to walk around during such hours, hell, i even saw food delivery workers riding on their bikes at such hours, but it's still very late. The street was empty, and he didn't move an inch. I didn't think much of it and just closed the door to my kitchen and went to bed. The next day same thing happened.. that man came back again, same place same time. I assumed it was a different man, but he does have similar shape to the man from before. I tried to ignore him, thinking maybe it's a coincidence. But then it happened again, and again. 

I started to wonder if he was looking at my window, i just felt strange feeling that i was being watched. I was already thinking of calling the police and reporting a stalker, but what if that man is not even watching me, what if he is watching someone else, how do i even know if he is even watching me, maybe he goes here to smoke or watch the stars. I decided to stay calm and think rationally. After all, i don't know the guy, and assuming that he may be some sort of stalker would be rude. But everything changed when I couldn't fall asleep. 

I drank too much water before bed and i had to take a leak, so i went to the bathroom to do all my business. After i was done, i looked at my kitchen.. it was dark out and streets lights were off. I forgot to close the kitchen door. I have a bad memory, and i have to close the kitchen cause my cat would want to go there during the night and would start whining, waking me up in the process. So  i went to the kitchen, but i foolishly decided to look at my window out of sheer curiosity.. and that's when i saw him again. The man was still standing there. The time was like 1 am, why was he still there? I tried to carefully look at the window, crouching down a little so he won't see me. 

He stood there, motionless, i could see him barely. I felt chill run down my spine. I decided that maybe it was time to do something, so i was about to call the police, but i accidentally clicked on the flashlight option. I turned it off, hoping he won't realise i am still awake. My heart jumped as i began to get up. He was still standing there, but i felt like something changed about him. I couldn't point it out at first, until i saw it.. his knees were bending. He moved, should i be scared, should i run? My first instict was to back away.. until he finally made his move. He jumped across the road, and with a loud thud of my window, he appeared before me. That was no ordinary man, he jumped from there to here like it was nothing. He was holding onto my window. You know when frogs stick themselves to the window, he was doing that. His face was so close to the window, he looked like he was trying to go through the glass. And his face.. he was smiling, his dark eyes were focused on me, his teeth were long, and his face was pale and full of wrinkles. He wore black winter coat with a hood on, i finally understood what he was wearing. I didn't know what to do.. i slowly backed away, grabbing my knife incase it somehow menages to break in..

That's when the worst thing happened. He started to slap my window repeatedly while screaming and laughing into it like a banshee. I jumped and dropped the knife, fighting this thing wouldn't be worth it anyway. I grabbed my cat, shoes and keys, i only wore a short and boxers, but i ain't got time for dressing up. I could hear the sound of glass breaking slowly, before i could hear the shatter just as i closed the door. I locked my door uptight, thankfully i had 2 locks, one of which could only be locked with a key from outside. I ran out of the door screaming bloody murder. I grabbed my phone and called for the police, i told them that someone broke into my house, i did not mention the fact that intruder leaped like a grasshopper into my apartment. I had to hide somewhere, so the best solution in my eyes was to hide inside an elevator. I was afraid of him trying to break through one of the windows in-between the floors next to garbage disposal. I kept waiting until suddenly the elevator started moving to the first floor. Thankfully it was just the police, arriving to my complex. 

I explained that someone climbed into my window somehow and got into my apartment, despite how weird it sounded, they believed me and told me to wait somewhere safe. One of my  neighbours on the lower floor heard my screech and decided to help me hide in her apartment. An hour later, and Police reported that the culprit didn't steal anything, but he did make a mess in my apartment, kitchen window was shattered completely. I drew them a sketch of the person, i told them that i saw that man standing outside actoss the street from my house for awhile, they promised me that they will find a culrpit as soon as possible, recommending me that i should stay at my relarive's place or a place of my close friends. I used to stay the night at mt grandma's place, so i asked them to drive me there, so i won't have to get on taxi and so i feel a little safer. 

That night i slept at my grandma's place and i decided to stay with her for a few days while police investigated the scene. I left my computer in my house, but police eventually brought it to me, cause i asked them. They did not identify the culrpit, but fortunately, that damn grasshooper left fingerprints on my window.. at least what was left of it. So now they have my sketch, my account, and proof that he actually was real and i did not make it up. Hopefully they menage to find him.. although i doubt it, cause it can't be a normal person.

Currently i am still staying at my Grandma's place, a bit nervous of going back to my house after the incident. I feel a lot safer with my grandparents, they were worried about me, but i thankfully got out without any injuries. I might tell you more about them in the future.. if you believe me at least..
