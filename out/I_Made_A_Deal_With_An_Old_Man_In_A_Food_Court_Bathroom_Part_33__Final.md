“Psst! Psst! Mr. Hard-Sell! Wake Up!”, I heard Bob say, waking me up. 

I groggily opened my eyes, and lifted my head off the pillow, to see Bob and the Seeker standing side by side in front of my dresser. 

I quickly rolled on my back, and sat up, turning my head to look at them 

I then looked to my left to see Donna still sleeping. 

I looked back, and asked, wiping my eyes, “Bob? What are you two doing in our bedroom?”

“I’m sorry, Mr. Hard-Sell! It is time!”, Bob said coldly. 

The Seeker just smiled. 

I then took a look at my arm… 14 minutes, 37 seconds, and counting. 

I put my hands over my face, and let my body fall back onto the bed. 

I knew this day would come, I was just hoping that with all the wild and crazy adventures we had together, they forgot. They didn’t. 

I guess the sudden jolt of the mattress, jarred Donna awake. 

“Michael! What’s wrong?”, she asked, half asleep. 

I just sighed, and pointed toward the dresser. 

Donna then raised her head, leaned up on her arm, and looked in that direction. 

“Bob? Old Man?”, she said surprised, pulling the blankets up around her neck, “Why are you in our bedroom?”

“Donna Dear! I’m afraid… it is time!”, Bob answered again.

“Time for what?”, she asked confused. 

“You didn’t tell her, Mr. Hard-Sell?”, Bob inquired. 

“Tell me what?”, Donna asked worried. 

I just sighed, sat back up, and looked at Bob. 

“Tell me what?”, she asked again, more intense this time, and pulling on my arm. 

I turned to look at her, as she let go of my arm. 

“Um! You see, Babe. Um! Seven years ago, I met the old man in the bathroom at the mall. I was wearing that jacket of mine that you like so much. He asked me if I would sell my soul for Rock and Roll like the jacket said. 

I foolishly said yes, thinking he was just some random old man fucking with me. He wasn’t. He was, and still is, a Soul Seeker. 

I inadvertently sold my soul, which allowed me to get anything I wanted for the next seven years, but at the end, I had to spend eternity in Hell. 

There’s a counter on my arm that tells me how much time I have left. 

I wanted to become a Rock Star, and I did, but now my time is up.”, I said, “I have to go to Hell now! Well, in 9 minutes and 42 seconds.”

“I don’t see anything on your arm?”, Donna said almost in tears. 

“You won’t, only Bob and I can see it.”, I answered. 

I then turned to Bob, and asked, “Why didn’t you just let the timer count down, and take me while I was sleeping?”, I asked

“I like you, Mr. Hard-Sell, I really do. I do not want to do this, but a deal is a deal. 

I normally would have done just that, but like I said, I like you. I feel I at least owe you the opportunity to say goodbye, after all you have helped me do!”, Bob answered. 

I then turned to Donna, who was fully in tears at this point

“No! I don’t want you to go. What about the baby? I wish this wasn’t happening!”, she said, through falling tears, with her hands covering her face. 

I put my arm around her to try and console her, but she pulled away. 

I couldn’t really blame her. 

Her words were tearing through me, like a Langolier through time past. 

But it also got me thinking, “Want? Wish?”

“Wait a minute… maybe there IS a way out of this”, I thought. 

I closed my eyes and whispered, “God! I hope this works!”

“I have 2 minutes and 7 seconds left, I can still get anything I want, and you still owe me a wish!”, I said pointing at Bob.

His eyes grew wide, and a smile loosely formed on his face, like he knew where I was going with this. 

I quickly began listing off all the things I wanted, in rapid fire style. 

“I want to grow old with Donna
.
I want our baby to be healthy. 

I want to keep all the money.

I want to keep the house. 

I want to keep the cars. 

I want to keep the ability to get anything I want. 

I want to own the bus that Mr. Bellington gave me. 

I want Ricky and Tony to be successful. 

I want Derek and Corey to succeed. 

I want Stephen to find happiness. 

I want Rebecca and Donna to remain best friends. 

I want Edgar to learn how to play the keyboards.”

I then hesitated, breathing heavy. 

15 seconds…

I then took the deepest breath I could. 

“AND I WISH I HAD MY SOUL BACK!”, I yelled, and looked down at my arm. 

10 seconds... 

“You can’t do that!”, the Seeker yelled.

“A wish is a wish! Now grant it!”, I yelled to Bob. 

Bob just stood there. 

5 seconds…

“You owe me that wish!”, I yelled. 

3 seconds…

2 seconds…

1 second…

That loosely formed smile then formed into a happy one, as Bob snapped his fingers. 

In mid snap, time ran out, as flames began bursting up from the floor. 

I then heard Donna scream. 

I turned to look at her, as her face and body quickly began melting into a large pile of a flesh colored goo on the bed. 

I screamed, and looked at Bob and The Seeker. They were just standing there, in the midst of the flames. 

I then felt the bed give way underneath me. 

I felt my body falling… falling into the firey pits of Hell. 

I felt every molecule in my body slowly breaking apart, starting with my hands and feet, floating like embers at a campfire, right in front of my eyes, just like it did, when Bob transported Tony and I from the basement to the alley. 

The pain was immense, and the heat was unbearable. 

I could hear flames crackling, and blood curdling torturous screams from below, as my body disintegrated.

I screamed again. 

Suddenly, a huge bright white mist, resembling the one that the Seeker sucked out of me, when I first went to hell, and he took my soul, appeared out of nowhere, and was barreling at me fast. It slammed hard into my chest, just as my upper torso was beginning to break apart. 

Everything went black. 

The next thing I knew, my body slammed back together again, and I was ascending upward through the flames, engulfed in the ball of white light. 

I closed my eyes. 

The moment I did, I felt my body slam down hard on the mattress. 

I bounced off the bed, and onto the floor, still screaming. 

“Michael! Are you ok? What happened?”, I heard Donna say. 

At least it was her voice. 

I opened my eyes, as I got up on my hands and knees. 

I then looked at my arm. 

There was nothing there. 

I stayed there, on my hands and knees, thinking. 

“I’ve always heard that Hell is a repetitious loop of the one thing that you fear the most. 

Mine was losing Donna and the baby. 

Am I going to relive that moment over and over again for all of eternity?”, I thought, “Is that my Hell?”

I closed my eyes, sighed, and opened them again. 

When I did, I saw the tips of Bob’s Black wing tipped shoes come into view. 

I then looked up. 

“Ta-da!”, Bob said… “Well played, Mr. Hard-Sell… Well played!”, as he extended his right hand to me. 

I hesitantly grabbed it. 

He then helped me to my feet. 

The bedroom was completely intact. 

“Am I in Hell?”, I asked Bob. 

“No, Michael! You are here in the real world, in your house, with Donna, and your unborn child.”, he replied smiling. 

Donna then came running, well, briskly walking, 4 months pregnant, remember? 

Anyway, she came around the side of the bed, in her nightgown, and bear hugged me, almost knocking me over. 

I hugged her back. 

She then let go of me, and punched me in the arm, hard. 

It hurt a little, reminding me not to piss her off again. 

“You are an asshole, Michael! Don’t you do that to me again!”, she said, then kissed me. 

After the kiss, I touched her face, to see if she was real. She was. 

I then looked at Bob.

“You called me Michael!”, I said, “Why?”

“That is your name!”, he replied. 

“You have called me, Mr. Hard-Sell, for the last 6 and a half years, no sense in stopping now.”, I retorted. 

“Very Well! Mr. Hard-Sell it is.”, Bob said smiling, “Now, Let’s talk!”, he said. 

“Can we get dressed first?”, I asked.

“Absolutely! Do you have any Red wine?”, he asked. 

“No, Bob! We don’t drink!”, I answered.

 “Very well then!”, Bob said, “I shall meet you in the dining area! Which way is that?”

“Down the hall, down the stairs, make a right, and you’ll run right into it.”, Donna answered. 

“Thank you!”, Bob replied, and walked out of the bedroom door. 

We both then got dressed, and walked downstairs to meet Bob. 

We arrived to find him, sitting at the table, twiddling his thumbs. 

I then looked out of the dining room window, to see our bus,  sitting in the driveway, next to my Mustang. 

I smiled. 

I then turned to Bob, “Where’s the Seeker?”, I asked. 

“He was upset, that I gave you your soul back, and used some rather distasteful words, directed at me, so I gave him a few go rounds on my little rollercoaster. That’s should calm him down.”, Bob answered. 

“Okay, Bob! Um! What’s up?”, I asked, sitting down, while Donna went to make a pot of coffee. 

“Mr. Hard-Sell! I am so glad it ended up this way. I did not want to do that to you. But let me ask you this, Did you know what you were going to do with that wish when you said you would, and I quote, I’ll reserve my wish for another time, end quote?”, Bob asked. 

“No! Not really! I just knew it would be good to have in my back pocket, but I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, until today!”, I responded. 

“You know, Mr. Hard-Sell, through all my many years of existence, there have only been two people to ever beat me at my own game… the first was Jesus Christ, and the second was you!”, he said, “Not to say that you are Christ-like, because you are not, but I am glad you succeeded in getting your soul back.  

Donna then returned, “Coffee’s going!”, she said, as I got up, pulled out the chair next to me, for her, then sat back down.

Bob then continued, “Now, as I have said numerous times before, I like you, I really do, so I assure you both, that you’re little girl, yes, it is a girl!”

Donna then smiled from ear to ear. 

“Yes!”, she said. 

“Your little girl, will want for nothing. If you can not provide it for her, Good ole Uncle Bob will. I promise you that.”, Bob said. 

“Thanks, Bob!”, we both said in unison. 

“I’ll go check on the coffee!”, Donna said, getting up and walking to the kitchen. 

“Is this the end, Bob? Will I ever see you again after this?”, I asked. 

“Oh, yes, Mr. Hard-Sell, and, No, it is not the end. I plan to keep a close eye on all of you! I will not interfere with your lives, but I will always be there, if you ever need me!”, he answered. 

Donna then returned with three cups of coffee, a pitcher of cream, and a bowl of sugar, with a spoon. 

“Would you like some coffee, Bob?”, she asked. 

“Is it hot? I like hot!”, he asked. 

“Yes”, she replied. 

“Then, Yes! I have never had coffee before. But there is a first time for everything!”, he said laughing. 

“How do you make it?”, he asked. 

“We have a coffee pot! You know what a coffee pot is, right?”, I stupidly asked. 

“Yes, Mr. Hard-Sell, I have equipped many different vehicles with one for your enjoyment, and watched you make it many many times.”, he answered, “I meant, how do you prepare it?” 

“Oh! I put a little cream, and 2 sugars in mine!”, I answered, “Donna likes it black with sugar!”

“I’ll take it like that!”, he said. 

Donna then prepared my cup, her cup, and his cup, and placed them all in front of us. 

Bob then took a sip. 

“Oh, this is most excellent! I love it! It burns, and is soothing at the same time!”, he said, “I’ve done the music business, now I think I’ll get into the coffee business. But what to call it! Help me here!”, he said. 

“Um, Hell’s Brew!”, I said. 

“For a songwriter, you are bad with words. No, nothing Hell related! I Got it! Keurig, which means excellence in Dutch. What do you think?”

It’s catchy!”, Donna said. 

“I can create my own machine, offer single serve portions, in little plastic cups, I think I will call them K-Cups, charge an outrageous price for them, humans will go crazy to get them, and every coffee company in the world will copy my cup design, and offer their own brand of coffee to be used in my machine, for a price that is. It’s brilliant. 

Oh, I must get started on this right away. I really must be going. Thank you for the coffee. I bid you both ado”, then he left. 

How did he leave?… C’mon, you remember!… Keep thinking!…That’s right!…

He snapped his fingers, and disappeared into a cloud of gray smoke. 

I knew you’ve been paying attention. 

Two weeks later, human time, I saw the first Keurig commercial on TV. 

Anyway, Bob gave us an endless, lifetime supply of K-Cups, any flavor, gets us all the new machines, as well as let’s us be the taste testers for any and all new coffee blends. It’s great. 

Donna likes the iced coffees, I prefer it hot. 

Anyway, Donna gave birth to a beautiful, healthy baby girl, about 5 months later. 

We decided to name her Robyn, after Bob, who’s first name is actually Robert, remember? 

Robert… Robyn… Get it. Good. 

Everyone was there at the hospital, except Derek and Corey, obviously, and Stephen, who was off touring the country. 

Edgar and Rebecca informed us that they too were going to have a baby, and that Bob was a proud grandpa. 

They decided to name her Calypso, meaning she who hides. 

We brought Robyn home about a week later. 

About 6 months after that, human time, there was a knock on the door. I opened it up to see Edgar and  Rebecca standing there, with Rebecca holding a 3 month old, human time, bouncing baby demon succubus girl. 

I don’t know how old she was in Hell time. 

With them were two humongous Great Danes. Edgar explained that they were Hell Hounds, and were specifically trained to protect their person, or persons. 

One was named Bill, and the other was named Janice. 

Donna and Baby Robyn then joined me at the door. 

“Rebecca!”, Donna yelled. 

“Bestie!”, Rebecca yelled  

They then ran to each other and hugged, trying not to squash the babies in between them. 

When the hugfest was over, Donna, Rebecca, and the babies went inside, leaving Edgar, myself, and the two dogs, standing on the front steps. 

I asked Edgar why the dogs had people names instead of animal names. 

He said, “Imagine you are at home alone! Someone breaks in, and threatens to kill you. If you call out, Demon, or Hellion, they are going to know you’re calling dogs, and they will prepare for dogs. But if you call, Bill, or Janice, followed by their “GO” word. They are going to think that you’re scared and calling your overweight uncle, or your petite little girlfriend, and blow it off. They won’t be expecting 2 200 pound pissed off Hell Hounds coming at them”

It kinda made sense. 

He then told me that they were a present from Bob to the two of us, and Robyn, as he leaned up, cupped his hand next to his mouth, and whispered in my ear, “Their “GO” word is OPPUGNATIO, which means attack in Latin. Remember that word… OPPUGNATIO! I don’t want to say it too loud. I don’t want them to hear it, and kill us all.”

I mouthed the word to myself, and said, “Thanks! I’ll tell Donna later.”

I then asked who was going to protect him and Rebecca. 

He said, “If anyone breaks in, Rebecca will use her seduction abilities to draw them near. When their guard is down, I will rip their heads off, and feast on their flesh, chewing and chomping their bones, inner organs, muscles, and fatty tissue, until there’s nothing left of them, but a burp!”

He got real intense at the end there. It scared me a little, especially when he laughed. 

“Oh! At least you have a plan!”, I responded. 

“Yeah! We’ve been talking about it for a while. Here you go!”, he said, handing me the leashes. 

One of the dogs then barked, I think it was Bill, followed by a tiny puff of gray smoke exiting his mouth. 

“Thanks Bob!”, I whispered. 

I then invited Edgar inside, leading the dogs in as well. 

We found Donna and Rebecca sitting at the dining room table, and the babies in the play pen nearby. 

The dogs sat in the corner watching us. 

We then resumed our conversation. 

“What about Axel?”, Donna said, looking at the dogs, “Won’t they kill her?”

“No! Hell Hounds do not see cats as a threat, like normal canines do. They will probably get along really well!”, Edgar responded. 

And they did. 

Bill and Janice were very emotional the day that Axel passed, and even to this day, lay out by the tree we planted over the spot where we buried Axel.  

Axel is still around though. 

Occasionally, we’ll hear that little bell that comes on most cat toys ring, or hear the sound of a cat meowing as we’re eating dinner, or walking down the hallway. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking, “It’s probably just a cat outside!”

And that could be possible, when we hear a cat meow while eating dinner. 

But I seriously doubt, if we’d be able to hear a bell from outside, or be able to hear a cat meow from outside, while we’re walking through an upstairs hallway, with no windows in it, and all the doors shut. 

Explain that one!

Plus, Bill and Janice have been seen on multiple occasions, chasing “nothing” around the yard, or staring at the tree. 

They know she’s here too. 

Anyway, Edgar said all we had to do, was feed both dogs a tiny drop of blood, from each one of the three of us, just once, and that will tell them who their person, or persons are. 

Now, before you go thinking that we stabbed Robyn to get her blood, or something crazy like that. 

The hospital gave us a small vile of her blood, when Donna and Robyn were released. Why, I’m not really sure, but this town is a little different then most, if you haven’t heard. 

Donna and I finger pricked ourselves, and dripped a little on their dog food, as well as some from Robyn’s vile, when we first fed them, and they have been loyal to us ever since. 

In case you’re wondering, the Hell Hounds only eat Royal Canin Dog Food, from France. 

Axel ate Royal Canin cat food, from that day on, until the day she passed. 

Bob sends us a monthly shipment, even to this day. 

Now, according to Rebecca, succubus births are almost immediate. 

No contractions! 

No epidural! 

No Pain! 

Nothing!

One second you’re pregnant, the next second it’s plopping on the floor. Don’t worry, the baby is protected by a Heavy duty, Gel-like webbing, when it comes out, so the baby doesn’t get hurt when it falls. 

There is no time to gather family and friends, so we didn’t even know about the birth, until they showed up on our doorstep. 

Now, before you start thinking that Bob freaked out, and threw them out of hell, that was not the case. 

Apparently, Edgar and Rebecca, were staying with Bob, in one of his spare rooms. 

Bob has a mansion in Hell, being he’s the devil and all. 

They had gone out to spend time together, leaving Bob to babysit.

Now, I don’t know what there really is to do in Hell, but apparently there’s something that interests them. 

Anyway, Edgar had installed surveillance cameras in their room, unbeknown to Bob, to keep an eye on the baby while they were occupied with other things. 

They both checked the footage when they got home, and saw Bob dancing around in a diaper, with a bonnet on his head, and a pacifier in his mouth, trying to entertain the baby.

I cried with laughter when Edgar told me that. 

Anyway, Edgar blackmailed Bob with the video, saying he would show it to everyone in Hell, if he didn’t allow him, Rebecca, and the baby, to live in the real world, and lead normal lives, also so that Rebecca could hang out with her bestie Donna. 

He agreed, and even bought them a house three houses down from ours.

Rebecca got a job at the Hooters in the next town over. Sales went straight through the roof. It was always packed, and still is to this day. 

The food is good, but Rebecca  is the main attraction. Guys from everywhere, and a few ladies, mostly truck drivers, come to see, well, excuse my language, but… “Tits and Tail”, as they say. 

She makes a killing in tips. 

There’s a sign posted when you walk in, that reads, “No Tail Touching! Offenders Will Be Whipped.”

Rebecca said that she has only had to whip a couple overzealous patrons, with her tail, a couple times, in the past 30 years, and that some guys even offer her money to whip them for no reason. 

She always says “No!”

Ricky gave Edgar a job at BB & T Music, as a stock clerk. He got to be really good friends with Tony, and they even perform together, Tony on the accordion, and Edgar on the keyboards, every Sunday Night, at the store, from 8 until 9, with Ricky and I  sometimes joining in on guitar, but we don’t want to take the spotlight away from them. We had our time. This is theirs. 

It’s amazing how many people actually show up to see them. 

They decided to call themselves Accordaboard. 

They do 80’s Metal covers on keyboard and accordion, just like Apocalyptica does with Cellos. 

Bob offered them free use of his studio to record a demo tape, if they ever want to try and go professional. 

Now, I know what you’re thinking, “Why doesn’t Bob just sign them to Hellfire Records.”

Well, you see, as I mentioned before, Bob is now in the coffee business, and has no interest in returning to the music business, as far as I know. 

Hellfire Records is closed until further notice. 

Robyn has grown up to be a very caring, loving woman. She’s now in her early Thirties, and working at the local ASPCA. She loves animals. She is also dating a guy named Jimmy, who works at the ASPCA as well. 

Calypso had to be home schooled, for obvious reasons, and is now in her thirties as well. 

She is very mild mannered, not flirtatious at all. She likes being single, and intends to stay that way. 

She assists Robyn at the ASPCA. 

Robyn believes all the cats and dogs accept Calypso, as one of their own, because she has a tail, just like they do. 

Robyn and Calypso share an apartment together, in the next town over, and have been best friends since infancy. 

Tony joined The Richard Simmons Workout Club, back when he teamed up with Ricky. I don’t know the real name of it. 

Anyway, he appeared in one of Richard’s “Sweatin’ To The Oldies” Videos, and has lost over 130 pounds. 

He’s kept the weight off, and goes to the gym 4 nights a week now. 

Bob stops by every now and then, to check up on everyone, and to say Hi! 

Business is going good, Hell business that is, as I’m sure you can figure that out for yourselves, with the way the world has been going lately. 

The coffee business is going good as well. 

I never saw the old man again though. Bob said he’s still upset about me ruining his perfect track record. 

Donna and I are still going strong. 

She never worked, because I could afford her not to. 

She does volunteer work at the local homeless shelter, now that Robyn is grown. 

A few years back, she became very obsessed with something she calls, “Pioneer Woman”. 

The whole house is decorated in “Pioneer Woman” stuff.  

She has a massive collection, collecting multiples of each thing. 

Numerous Rolling pins, numerous salt and pepper shakers, numerous plate and dish sets. 

She’s even got “Pioneer Woman” towels in the bathroom, and has every comforter and sheets set that there is to offer. 

Right now she has a “Vintage Floral” Comforter and sheet set on the bed. It’s her favorite design of hers. 

It’s really not my style, but it’s her house, so she can do with it what she wants. 

I haven’t really used my “gift” too much over the past 30 years, except for in the moment kind of things. If I’m too tired to get up and make a cup of coffee, I’ll “want” a cup of coffee, or if I don’t feel like going to the gas station and filling up the cars, I’ll “want” a full tank of gas, things.  like that. 

I started writing again a few years back, not songs this time, but stories, some true, some not. 

This one is 100% true. 

I discovered a forum called Reddit, and have been posting my stories on various subreddits there. 

Damn… Someone just knocked on the door… hold on a second. I’ll be right back…

Hey ya’ll. I’m back. That was Bob!  

He just showed up, in an even longer limousine this time. 

Now! Have I got some good news to share with you. 

Bob just informed Donna and I, that 80s Metal is making a comeback, as multiple bands from our era have started touring again, and that they are selling out each show. 

Def Leppard, Guns & Roses, RATT, Motley Crue, well, Motley  Crue never stopped touring, but you get the idea, Right?

Anyway, He said he wanted, no pun intended, to see if we would be interested in touring again, and possibly recording another album, at Hellfire studios, if the tour goes good, since he has people to run his coffee business, and that he kinda missed the old times. 

“Hell, Yeah!!”, we said in unison. 

Bob promised, no soul sucking box behind the drum kit this time. 

He also said that he already talked to Edgar and Rebecca, as well as Robyn, Jimmy, Calypso, Tony, and Ricky, my old friend Ricky. 

Bob got his phone number when he came to play on the album. 

Bob said that the original Ricky said No, saying that his Pops was now in his 80’s, has had some major health issues, and that he did not want to leave alone him in that condition, but promised to keep us all informed. 

We all completely understood. 

I hope everything is okay, Mr. Bellington. 

Anyway, everyone else agreed, and are all waiting in the limo for us. 

Jimmy is Robyn’s boyfriend, in case you forgot. 

Anyway, He also said he contacted Stephen, I don’t know how, and that he’s all in as well, but only if Cindy can come along for the ride. 

Apparently, Cindy is the name of his girlfriend. 

Bob agreed, everyone else did too, including us. 

We’re heading to Kansas to pick them up, as soon as I’m finished here, then we’re off to Washington DC, to try and find Derek and Corey. It won’t be hard, as long as I “want” to find them. 

Wish us luck anyway!

Yeah, Baby! We’re getting the band back together. I’m so excited. 

I’ll tell everyone you said Hi. 

Rock and Roll! 

I threw up the horns when I said that. 

I’ll let you know if anything interesting happens. 

Oh, Hey Janice. 

Shit! The dogs! What are we going to do with the dogs?

Are any of you interested in watching the Hell Hounds for us while we’re gone?

Never mind, we’ll take them with us. I don’t think anyone will mind. Their good dogs!

C’mon Guys. Bill! Janice! Let’s go bye-byes. 

Are you ready, Babe?… Here, I’ll take that. 

I gotta go y’all. 

Axel! We’ll be back. 

Later,  Dudes And Dudettes!
