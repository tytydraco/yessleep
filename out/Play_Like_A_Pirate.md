The yacht party sounded like fun. I mean, what was I supposed to say? *‘No Mr. Millionaire, I don’t want to get drunk and party on your expensive yacht with all your rich friends.’*

&#x200B;

Look… I’m not naive. When my friends and I were approached by Tony D’Amao, I knew why he was talking to us. Old rich guys like that don’t walk up to a bunch of 22 year olds at a Miami bar just to talk about the weather. He was looking to get laid and while I had absolutely zero intention of sleeping with him, I also wasn’t going to say no to the free booze. So long as he kept the drinks coming, my friends and I were more than happy to pretend we knew who he was and let him think he was flirting with us. To be honest, I wasn’t paying that much attention to what Tony was saying when he came up to us in that bar. I was already a little tipsy when he’d shown up and the fact that cocktails he kept buying didn’t really help me sober up. But I do remember that he’d talked a very big game.

&#x200B;

According to Tony D’Amao, he was in the same ballpark with Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Bill Gates. I don’t know if he actually believed his own bullshit or not, but when I looked him up later, what I found was that he was just a regular ass banker. Not some bigshot entrepreneur, just some divorced asshole who’d climbed the corporate ladder and probably had a lot of help along the way.

&#x200B;

Anyways, back to the drinks… We had about two days left on Spring Break, and were trying to cram as much living as we possibly could into it. That was easier said than done. I know that on paper, spring break in Miami sounds like a lot of fun. But trust me. It’s a shitshow. Turns out that everyone else everywhere had the exact same idea that you did, and when that happens, Miami gets even more hectic than normal. Everything’s crowded, everyone’s drunk and everything’s expensive as fuck.

&#x200B;

I’d gone to Miami with my friends, Shannon and Peach, and we’d been trying to make the most of our few days and to be fair, it’s not like we were miserable the entire time. We were having fun! I just wasn’t expecting such a fucking gut punch to my wallet.

&#x200B;

We’d already spent the day at the beach and had been planning on hitting up some nightclubs, having some drinks and dancing. Shannon and I were both majoring in biological science at the time, and remember her joking with me that we could probably write a case study on some of the drunk jackasses we’d met at some of the clubs.

&#x200B;

Peach had said it would be better as an anthropological case study, but of course, she did. We’d stopped off at this restaurant for dinner and drinks, and were sorta just chilling after dinner while we figured out which club we’d be heading to.

&#x200B;

And that was when he showed up.

&#x200B;

Tony D’Amao was anywhere between his early thirties and his mid fifties. It was hard to say. He had a full head of black hair that may or may not have been a toupee and a very expressive face. He kinda reminded me of Jim Carrey, in that regard. When he spoke, sometimes his eyes got really wide, or his mouth seemed to open just a little too much. It was actually kinda creepy. Anyways, he’d sort of just waltzed over to our table uninvited, flashed us a toothy grin, and said something like:

&#x200B;

“You girls having a good night?”

&#x200B;

I remember that Peach had given us both a look that said: ‘Who the fuck is this guy and why is he talking to us?’ But none of us actually did anything more than smile awkwardly and say we were doing well.

“Alright, alright. You drinking? You girls old enough to drink?” He’d asked, flashing us one of those weird cartoon smiles, “How old are you?”

“22…” Shannon had said, before glancing at us with an: ‘Oh shit, did I just say too much?’ look.

“22? You look beautiful. Like little angels. 22…” He said, “What are you drinking? You want a refill?”

&#x200B;

At this point, we were a mix of curious and concerned, and had any of us been sober, we probably would’ve told this weirdo to fuck right off. But he was offering us drinks and we’d sorta shared a look that promised each other that none of us would be left alone with this weirdo. So with the sacred pact sealed, we figured we’d take him up on his offer. I guess to his credit, aside from being a middle aged weirdo looking to fuck some 22 year olds just so he could feel better about himself, Tony mostly came across as harmless… He mostly talked about himself as he sat with us, ordering round after round of drinks and we just sorta smiled and nodded as he regaled us with the most boring stories humanly possible.

&#x200B;

I only vaguely remember him ever mentioning his yacht party. I’d been in the middle of another sangria when he’d said something along the lines of:

“I’ve got some friends getting together on my boat tomorrow! Gonna be the best party of the week. You wanna come? I’ve got some friends. Business partners. Looking for good little girls like you. Smart girls. Be a great way to make some business connections, yeah? And have a little fun too, yeah!”

&#x200B;

At the time, I hadn’t actually said anything, but I remember Shannon putting on a smile and nodding.

“Yeah! Sounds fun!” She said, and I’m pretty sure she was just sort of saying that to be nice. I don’t think she actually thought he was serious. But the moment she said that, his eyes lit right up as if he’d just discovered a winning lottery ticket.

&#x200B;

“Yeah! We’re gonna have a little fun!” He said, “Where you girls staying? I’ll have my driver pick you up! VIP treatment! Only the best!”

I recall Shannon looking a little baffled, and she’d glanced at me and Peach. Peach had just sort of raised an eyebrow at her, before shrugging. They both looked at me.

&#x200B;

I had only been half paying attention to the conversation up until that point, and suddenly I realized that this fucking guy was serious! We sort of shared a look with each other, before deciding: *‘Fuck it. Let’s party with this rich loser on his yacht.’*

&#x200B;

Maybe that wasn’t the soundest decision, but we were all drunk as hell, so cut us some goddamn slack. With all three of us committed to our dumb decision, Shannon put her smile back on and gave Tony the name of our hotel.

&#x200B;

“Alright!” He’d said, “I’ll have my driver out waiting for you tomorrow. Ten AM. Waiting for…” He paused, trying to remember our names, “Shannon… Peach and… Kaleigh, yeah?”

“That’s us.” Peach said.

“Shannon, Peach and Kaleigh!” He repeated, clapping his hands together, “Ten sharp! Gonna be the best night of your lives!”

&#x200B;

We’d had another round with him after that. Tony had started to go back into his boring stories, and none of us were into it anymore. Shannon made an excuse that some friends were waiting for us at a club, and we used that excuse to slip away.

&#x200B;

An hour later, we were at an actual club, drunkenly dancing the night away and none of us were thinking about Tony and his yacht party. We stumbled back to our hotel at three that morning and crashed hard. All in all, we had a pretty good night.

&#x200B;

I remember waking up the next morning to the sound of someone pounding on our door. Shannon was curled into a ball on one of the beds and I remember watching her pull the pillow over her head and groan. In the other bed, Peach burrowed deeper under the covers. I didn’t have such luxuries, since I’d made the genius decision to doze off in an armchair.

&#x200B;

The knocking just got louder and I groaned before getting up and shuffling over to the door. I opened it part of the way and was greeted by a large bald man who kinda looked like a giant baby. He wore a black polo and looked at me with what an expression that was hard to read.

Honestly, for a moment I was sure he was going to kick down the door and arrest us or something like that.

&#x200B;

“You three got a car waiting for you out front.” He said, “Compliments of Tony.”

“Tony?” I grumbled, not immediately remembering who the fuck Tony was. Although it came rushing back to me fairly quickly.

“Get ready. Cast off is in an hour. You don’t want to be late.” He said.

&#x200B;

I closed the door and took a step back. I looked back over at Peach and Shannon. Shannon had poked her head out of the blankets.

“Oh God… Did that guy actually send a car for us?” She asked, “It’s like 9 in the morning!”

“You want me to tell him to get lost?” I asked, “Say we’re sick or something.”

“Maybe?”

Shannon sat up, still shrouded in her blanket. All I could see were a pair of bare legs beneath a blanket burrito.

&#x200B;

“He said it’s a yacht party… Could be fun…” Peach murmured, “Plus, free booze…”

“I vote we pass.” Shannon said, “Come on, that guy was weird…”

“Free booze…” Peach said again, “It’s some rich assholes yacht party… Isn’t that part of the whole experience?”

“Kinda.” I admitted, “I mean, he’s obviously got money. And he’s got a driver. What’ve we got to lose?”

&#x200B;

“That’s the kinda question you don’t really want answered,” Shannon murmured.

Peach dragged herself out of bed and crashed into Shannon, wrapping her arms around her.

“Come on, it’s a yacht party.” She said. I found myself wondering if she was still a little drunk, “It’s part of the whole spring break experience, come onnnnn.”

“Fuck offfffff.” Shannon replied, before sighing and pushing Peach off of her, “Fine… But I’m bringing my mace…”

&#x200B;

None of us were going to argue with that.

&#x200B;

We got ourselves put together pretty quickly with clean clothes and a shower. Once we were ready, we shuffled out to meet the Baby Man in the hall. He’d been standing ominously outside our door the entire time, which wasn’t creepy at all! He’d led us to the front of the hotel where a black Audi was waiting for us. It had a very ornate white decal along the side that read: “*Work Like A Captain, Play Like A Pirate.*” A sexy pirate lady with her tits out was drinking rum beside the text, because of course that was part of it.

&#x200B;

The Baby Man opened the doors for us and we all piled inside, half awake and running on cheap hotel room coffee machine coffee. This probably wasn’t the best possible start to our millionaire yacht party experience, but it was still pretty in line with everything else we’d experienced in Miami. I don’t remember much about the ride to the yacht, other than the fact that we were tired and nothing really happened. The Baby Man played some late 90s eurodance music that might have once been part of some sort of party mix back in ancient times.

&#x200B;

When we eventually arrived at the marina and shuffled half awake out of the car. We’d barely taken a few steps before Tony was on top of us, greeting us with open arms.

“Girls! So glad you made it! I was starting to worry!” He said, “Up late partying, yeah? You have a good night last night?”

“Yeah. Great night.” Peach murmured, still mostly asleep.

&#x200B;

“Not too great, yeah? Tonights gonna be even better. You bring your swimsuits? If not, you can go without. Might not be the only ones, yeah?” He said, before laughing awkwardly.

“Alright, alright let’s go!” He ushered us towards the yacht, which was actually pretty big and already fairly crowded. The name ‘*Pirate*’ was written in big fancy letters along the side. I spotted a few other older men like Tony, a few frat boys, and a lot of girls like us.

&#x200B;

We made our way up the ramp onto the boat, and the first thing we did as soon as we were on board was find the bar.

&#x200B;

Tony had gotten distracted, talking with another man fairly quickly but that was fine by us. We had rum and coke, which was really all we needed. The yacht cast off about a half hour after we’d made it on board and from there, things were actually going pretty good. I mean, it was about as much fun as a party on a yacht could be! There was music, there was alcohol, we danced, we sang badly and we got trashed fairly quickly. We weren’t the only spring break students there, and from what I gathered from some of the other girls I’d talked to, we weren’t the only ones who Tony had randomly invited to this party. I kinda got the impression that he’d just sorta invited every cute girl he’d come across on account of some weird mid-life crisis or something, but that was just an educated guess.

&#x200B;

Tony himself went around greeting everyone with the same overly familiar, faux enthusiasm that he’d spoken to me, Shannon, and Peach with so that kinda just seemed like the way he was. The yacht drifted out towards sea, blasting loud music as it sailed away. Morning slowly drifted into afternoon and eventually dusk rolled around.

&#x200B;

My day sort of blurred together for the most part. I drank and I danced. I lost track of Peach and Shannon, although I’d occasionally see them around partying with everyone else.

&#x200B;

At around noon, there was a slight break in the party as a lunch/dinner buffet was served and I remember fixing myself a plate and standing by the railing near the back of the boat with Peach, talking with her as we ate. I don’t actually remember what we were talking about… But I do remember that I’d looked out over the open water, and noticed the fog in the distance. It was a long way off. I didn’t think we’d even come close to it. But I saw it.

&#x200B;

My attention was torn away when the boat had hit a rough wave and Peach had stumbled a little. She’d dropped her plate overboard, and we spent the next couple of minutes laughing about it, before wandering back to the party.

&#x200B;

It was close to dusk when I noticed the fog again. I’d taken another break from the party to have a cigarette on one of the upper decks. The music was still blasting loud and I found myself bobbing along with it, taking in the overall vibe even during my little moment of solitude. I’d looked out over the water, which looked beautiful underneath the orange popsicle hue of the sky, and I remember noticing the fog was a hell of a lot closer to us than it had been before. And it looked to be getting even closer.

&#x200B;

I didn’t think that much of it, obviously. It was just fog. I’m not exactly a nautical expert, but isn’t that kind of thing normal out on open water? I wasn’t really worried about rain or anything since there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. We weren’t even the only boat out there! I could see what looked like some sort of fishing boat off in the distance. It was a little deeper in the fog than we were, and they didn’t really seem too concerned about it.

&#x200B;

I took a drag of my cigarette and watched them for a while, as the fog engulfed them. Then when my cigarette had burned out, I tossed it into the ocean and headed back down to rejoin the party. As I made it down to the main deck and headed towards the dance floor, I allowed myself to take another look at the fishing trawler… And that’s when I noticed that something was wrong.

&#x200B;

The trawler had been fine a couple of minutes ago. Literally, nothing was wrong with it. Hell, they’d kinda looked like they were sailing into the fog! But now?

&#x200B;

Now it was on its side.

&#x200B;

I froze, staring at the other boat as it went down. I listened to the party around me and glanced back at the dance floor. As far as I could tell, nobody else had noticed what was going on yet. I was the only one.

&#x200B;

I approached the edge of the railing, staring out at the sinking ship and the reality of what I was seeing finally dawned on me. That was a sinking fucking ship! There were people on there! People who were probably in danger! We needed to do something!

&#x200B;

Once my drunk mind put all those pieces together, I was off like a shot, suddenly feeling a lot more sober than I had in days. From the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of Tony going below deck, and I ran to follow him. This was his boat, he could probably help, right?

&#x200B;

As I stumbled down the stairs, into a narrow hallway, I saw Tony walking away from me and called out to him.

“Tony! Tony, there you are…”

He’d stopped and looked back at me, that big dumb smile still plastered on his face.

“Oh hey! Kaleigh, right?”

“There’s a boat out there.” I said, “I think they’re going down! I think it’s sinking!”My words were pretty slurred, but I got the message out.

&#x200B;

Tony raised an eyebrow at me, before laughing.

“Another boat, yeah?” He asked, “Sure, sure. And where’s the best place to see it? Someplace quiet, I hope?”

&#x200B;

He took a step towards me, grinning from ear to ear and I took a step back. Did this fucking moron seriously think I was hitting on him??? This was a life or death emergency! Who in their right fucking mind would say: “*Hey. A boat is sinking nearby.*” to flirt with someone? Who in their right fucking mind would hear that, and consider it flirting?

“I’m serious!” I said, “I saw it!”

“Yeah?” He asked, reaching out to wrap an arm around me. He stank of rum. I don’t even know how he was still standing.

“You gonna show me?” He asked.

&#x200B;

I tried to pull away from him but he forced me closer.

“Let’s go talk about the boat…” He crooned, “Maybe in my cabin? Maybe while I suck your toes?”

“*What the fuck is wrong with you?!*” I snapped, finally pushing him off of me. “I’m trying to get you to help!”

“Aww, I need help too, angel baby.” He crooned, “Help to see your sexy feet…”

&#x200B;

He came for me again, and this time I just punched the weird asshole. I felt his nose break under my fist. He took a step back, giving me a strange, bewildered look as blood trickled out of his nose.

&#x200B;

“Ow…” He said, before falling forward and hitting the ground like a sack of potatoes. I’m not sure if I knocked him out, or if he was just that ridiculously drunk. Either way, when he hit the floor it occurred to me that I’d just punched out the one guy who was probably the best chance at helping the people on that boat. And because of that little mistake - I may have freaked out a little.

&#x200B;

My breathing got heavier as I looked down at Tony, unconscious on the ground. I took a step back, before turning and stumbling back up the stairs, swaying unevenly on my feet as I returned to the main deck. I looked around, seeing no familiar faces in the crowd. The music around me suddenly felt deafening. Everybody was so loud. I glanced over into the open water where the fishing trawler had been, but it was long gone. I didn’t even see anyone floating near the space where it had been.

&#x200B;

Had it sank already? I kept looking, hoping I’d see something, but my heart sank as I was greeted with just open water. Above us, the sky was looking cloudier as the fog rolled in. It seemed like it was moving faster than before… And watching as it drifted towards the yacht, I couldn’t help but think for a moment that maybe it was alive.

&#x200B;

I dismissed that idea pretty quickly, obviously!

&#x200B;

Well… Maybe not entirely…

&#x200B;

The fog seemed to move with purpose. It feels insane to say that, but it felt like it was coming right for us, and even though I was pretty drunk, I was convinced that fog didn’t move like that.

“Kaleigh?” I heard a voice say behind me, and turned to see Shannon staring at me. Her face was flushed by the booze, but she had a look of genuine concern on her face.

“What’s wrong?” Are you okay?” She put a hand on my shoulder.

&#x200B;

“We need to get out of here.” I said, “Something’s wrong… Something’s very, very wrong!”

“Whoa, whoa, whoa… Slow… Slow down. What’s up?” She didn’t seem to notice the fog coming in. But I could see it drifting over the yacht already. The few people who did notice, didn’t really seem to care. I could even hear a few of them cheering, like this was part of the fun! They didn’t know what this was.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know what this was!

&#x200B;

“Let’s just get Peach and get off this boat, please!” I begged, “Please, right now! Please!”

“You alright?” Shannon asked.

“I’m sick and I’m scared and I don’t want to be here anymore! Please, let’s just go!”

I grabbed Shannon's wrists, pleading with her and I knew from the look in her eyes that she wanted to help me.

“Okay…” She said, “Let’s go find Peach, alright?”

&#x200B;

She let me hold her hand as we weaved through the partygoers, and as we stepped away from the railing, I saw Tony shambling up the deck. Blood trickled down his face as he looked around, lips curled back in an animalistic snarl.

*“Girl…”* He hissed as his eyes fixated on me. He pushed past a few rich looking bastards like him, and a couple of frat boys to get to me, swaying drunkenly as he drew closer.

*“YOU!”*

&#x200B;

The moment Shannon noticed him, she stepped right in front of me.

“I invite you to *my party,* I let you drink *on my dime*, and *this* is how you treat me?” He snarled. I heard some of the frat boys he’d pushed out of the way laughing at him, and he shot them a death glare.

&#x200B;

“Leave her the hell alone!” Shannon said, staying between us. She gave me a glance, silently asking if I was the one who’d broken his nose. I’m pretty sure the blood on my knuckles confirmed it.

“What sour, worthless cunts you are…” He slurred. “Taking, taking, taking and giving nothing back… You’re like fucking animals!"

“We don’t owe you shit.” Shannon replied.

&#x200B;

“YOU PROVIDE ME NOTHING AND WASTE MY TIME!” He replied, snarling like a rabid dog. “Do you know who I am? *Do you?* I could have you and your friends stabled like *fucking horses.* Bitches for me to fuck at my pleasure! But I come to you, and I let you enjoy my hospitality so that you’ll come to me. I LET YOU COME HERE! I LET YOU!”

&#x200B;

“Step the fuck off, right now!” Shannon warned. She stood almost nose to nose with him, and in her high heels, she just about towered over him. A punch from me had broken this drunk asshole's nose. A beating from her probably could’ve put him in the hospital.

“Or what?” He asked, “You gonna hit me too? Try it. TRY IT, BITCH! YOU TRY I-”

&#x200B;

The yacht suddenly rocked. Shannon took a step back as Tony lost his footing and collapsed to the ground, looking around, dazed and confused.

“The hell?” He asked, our little conflict suddenly forgotten, “Did we hit something?”

The music was still playing, but nobody was dancing.

&#x200B;

Tony struggled to stand, and finally, someone helped him to his feet.

“Did we hit something?” He asked again, less certain this time. Up near the wheelhouse, I could see some of the yachts captains stepping out and looking around.

&#x200B;

“What did we just hit?” Tony called up to them. They didn’t seem to have any answer.

*“Fogs too heavy, but we were just in open water!”* One of them called down to him.

He looked down at Shannon and I, as if we’d somehow caused this, although he never said anything out loud.

&#x200B;

“I tried to tell you…” I said quietly, “I was trying to tell you…”

He stared at me, with rapt attention this time.

“Tell me what…?” He asked, his voice softer than before.

&#x200B;

The boat lurched again, more violently this time. Shannon and I were thrown off our feet, along with most of the other party guests. As I hit the ground, I caught a brief glimpse of the darkened ocean underneath the orange sky… And I could see something breaking the waves. A rippling, serpentine body of some sort…

&#x200B;

I only caught a brief glimpse of it. But I saw enough. And judging by the look of utter terror on Tony’s face, I knew that he’d seen it too.

&#x200B;

He forced himself to his feet, swaying unevenly as he looked up toward the wheelhouse.

“Get back in there! We’re getting the hell out of here!” He called.

&#x200B;

I watched the crew sprinting back into the wheelhouse. I felt the yacht rumble beneath me as the engine roared to life. But whatever was beneath us hit it again. This time was the hardest yet. The entire boat seemed to violently list to the side. I saw a few unlucky people who were too close to the edge go plummeting over the railing, and fall screaming into the water. Tony had a look of bewildered terror on his face.

“Lifeboats…” He said, “GET TO THE LIFEBOATS! WE NEED TO GO, NOW!”

&#x200B;

The crew who’d been handling the drinks and the music up until that point suddenly started moving their asses. The yacht rocked violently again. I heard the metal groan as the staff ran to get everyone aboard the lifeboats. I’d spied four on the yacht, and I hoped to God there’d be enough room for everyone. And that whatever was sinking the yacht right then, wasn’t going to go after them next.

&#x200B;

Among the crowd rushing onto some of the lifeboats, we could see Peach. She was ahead of us and made it onto the first boat out. Shannon and I watched it drop into the water, and felt the yacht shake again. The next boat was up ahead, and looking back, I saw Tony desperately pushing to try and get ahead of people to secure his spot on that boat. We were just ahead of him, and people were pouring in. The lifeboat had to be close to capacity if it wasn’t there already…

&#x200B;

From the corner of my eye, I could see the second lifeboat hightailing it away from the yacht. It had launched. The people ahead of us pushed their way into the lifeboat. It looked crowded. Too crowded. We never made it aboard before it launched too.

&#x200B;

One lifeboat left.

&#x200B;

I heard Tony swearing behind me as some meathead pushed him out of the way, knocking him to the ground. Shannon and I followed the meathead, rounding the deck of the yacht, towards the fourth and final lifeboat. A crewmember waved us on. There wasn’t much space left.. But it would hopefully be enough… Shannon stepped off the deck and into the lifeboat, before offering a hand to me.

&#x200B;

“Come on, come on!” She said as the boat rocked again and threw me off my feet.

I heard the crunch of metal and saw something massive emerge from the water a little further down the deck. Just what it was, I couldn’t see clearly. But I felt the yacht buckle under its weight. It was going to drag it down.

&#x200B;

“Come on!” Shannon called, as I scrambled to my feet again, only to feel a hand on my face, pushing me back to the ground. From the corner of my eye, I noticed Tony looking down at me, a disgusted sneer on his face as he raced for the lifeboat.

&#x200B;

“Close the doors! Go now!” He called, although the moment he’d set foot on it, Shannon had grabbed him, trying to push him back off again.

“LET GO!” He snarled, “THIS IS MY BOAT! I’M THE CAPTAIN HERE!” He barked.

&#x200B;

I grabbed him from behind, pulling him away from Shannon and hurling him down to the deck. He tried to get up, and I rammed the toe of my high heel right into his face, sending him sprawling back down before I stepped onto the lifeboat.

“Then you get to go down with the ship.” I panted.

&#x200B;

The doors closed and as the lifeboat launched, Tony just stared at me with a wide eyed, slack jawed expression. As our lifeboat dropped into the water, I held onto Shannon to keep myself from falling again. In ordinary circumstances, the covered lifeboat would’ve been pretty cushy, but it was jam packed with worried partygoers, and through the window I could still see more of them on the yacht, desperately waving their arms and begging us to come back.

&#x200B;

As we got further away from the Pirate, I could see a long, green serpentine thing coiled around the yacht. I could see its head emerging from the water, glowing, beady eyes shining in the twilight as it wrapped itself around the sinking ship one last time. Its weight seemed to buckle the yacht completely and at last, I saw the Pirate tipping onto its side.

&#x200B;

I closed my eyes, unable to watch how this nightmare ended. I’d seen enough.

&#x200B;

The coast guard found us drifting at the edge of the fog, later that evening. Shannon, Peach, and I, along with just about everyone else who’d been on that goddamn boat spent most of the next day talking to various people about what we’d seen. Some of them had a real ‘government spook’ type vibe to them, saying they were with the ‘FRB’ or some shit. For a little while, I was actually wondering if they were just going to murder us to cover up whatever the hell we’d seen out there… But no.

&#x200B;

By dinnertime the next day, Shannon, Peach and I were dropped back off at our hotel, dressed in the same party clothes we’d left in, with our makeup and hair both a mess.

&#x200B;

And that was it.

&#x200B;

Aside from the memories, it was just like nothing had even happened.

&#x200B;

I read an obituary in the newspaper a few weeks later, stating that Tony D’Amao had died in a tragic accident when a sudden storm had hit his yacht during a party. He and 16 other party guests had been unable to make it to the lifeboats and drowned. Everyone else was recovered safely. I guess that’s the official story. It was just a storm, not a giant fucking sea snake, or whatever the hell it was that we saw out there.

&#x200B;

Over the years, I’ve tried looking for answers on my own. So has Shannon and so has Peach. I even changed my major to marine biology, hoping that it might get me some answers. But, so far between the three of us we’ve turned up exactly jack shit.

&#x200B;

We’ve got some theories, obviously. Peach’s theory is that Tony knew what he was getting us into and that the party was some sort of weird offering to some deep sea entity… But of course she’d say that. Shannon and I think that Tony was just a fucking idiot who decided to hold his stupid yacht party in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe the noise of the party attracted that thing, maybe it just saw a big yacht floating there and thought: “*Hey, that looks edible!*”

&#x200B;

Either way… Our theory is that what we lived through was an attack by… Something. Possibly some sort of undocumented super predator (possible but unlikely, considering that it would be very hard for an undiscovered super predator to just be chilling out in the ocean without us knowing) or something that the government wanted to cover up (possible, given the presence of those FRB spooks… Assuming they even worked for the government. We found no evidence indicating they really did. The ‘F’ in their acronym could stand for anything really.) But those are just theories and without any proof beyond what we saw that day, we can’t really do much with either of them.
