It was a a rainy and cold Saturday night. I was about 15 years old at this time, and I was pretty big for my age.My dad came into my room and told me that they were leaving for a trip to Paris, a more 2 of them quality time romantic trip. I was  an only child so I would be alone. My dad thought I was mature enough. To spend the time we watched a movie called Texas chainsaw massacre. It was a good movie. Then my dad hugged me goodbye. My mom came in and kissed me on my forehead. 

We have a ring camera and I have the app downloaded on my phone. My dad told me if anyone is trying to break in, call the police and grab my shotgun. He had a 12 gauge over under barrel browning model. Then they left and I waved goodbye to them through the window.

I was getting very tired. My dad left some money to order a pizza. I called Little Caesars and ordered an extra cheese pizza. While the time was going I watched some movies and some Dexter.
The doorbell rang. I opened the door and nobody was there. Must have been some kids trying to prank me. Then I saw a car speed off. I saw the pizza to the left of me sitting on the outside small table. Dumbass I muttered to myself. I picked up the pizza and took it inside. I ate a couple slices of the pizza than put it in the fridge. I went upstairs to play some of this new game I was working on called Hotline Miami. It was getting late so I turned on the tv and went to bed. 

Motion detected:12:56 PM my phone said under notifications in the ring app. I was kind of startled and I picked up my phone and checked. It was footage of my front yard. Nobody was there. All I heard were male grunting sounds. I was very unsettled but I went back to sleep. 

Motion detected:1:46 AM my phone said under the ring notifications. This time it was my backyard. I looked around and saw that my backyard fence door was wide open. I nearly pissed my pants and walked downstairs to the backyard and shut the gate. I went back upstairs and shut the door. 

Motion detected:3:17 AM. The ring notifications were starting to piss me off. I checked the notifications and I looked. This time my front door was wide open and a masked man wearing a black hoodie and black pants was staring at the camera. He had a long object in his hand and he had a, wait a second he had a fucking human HEAD. My heart started pumping as I realized it was the Nextdoor neighbor Joe. He was always super nice to me. Then it hit me. He was grunting because he was pulling the body into my back yard. Then he decapitated Joe and left him there. 

I called 911 and grabbed my dadâ€™s shotgun. They got my address and said they would send a car asap. I heard the door slam shut. I hid under my bed loading the shotgun while i was shivering and shaking. Loud stomping was coming up the stairwell. He opened my door and thew the human head onto the floor. He wiped his knife thing and he started to crouch but then heard the police sirens. He immediately fled the house and the police came into my room and took me to the station so they could get information about the killer. I am currently sitting in the station typing this out. Never leave any of your doors unlocked.
