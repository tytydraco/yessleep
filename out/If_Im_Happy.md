**If I’m Happy**


**1**

**Piper at the Gates of Dawn**

I first met Adriana because of my best female friend Emily. I was a heavy stoner at the time, and I was just starting college in Honduras, the place I grew up in and grew to regret. I was given 1600 Lempiras a week (around $70) as an allowance, and I used to use it to buy two $35 weed pens a week. I didn't care about eating or going out with friends, shit I didn't even speak to my best friend for 6 months all I cared about was getting high.

It got to a point where I didn't even feel it. Substance abuse is self-harm when you’re depressed just like cutting yourself. You know you’re killing yourself (if not physically when it comes to weed), killing your potential and amplifying your depressed tendency to not care and not even wanting a future to wake up too. I used to get in cars and hope they'd crash and be the only person not to survive via slowly and painfully bleeding out in an ambulance, while the last thing I hear is a stranger who sees this every day unenthusiastically saying, “He didn’t make it”.

Getting back on topic. I met Adriana at the peak of my depression and weed dependence. Every day I would smoke with Emily in her car. Emily is a beautiful woman whose life is sad to me. She studied dentistry and took one class per trimester (for a seven-year career). She used to grow her own weed she called it Muppet fuzz. She always painted her hair and said that she would change but never did. Oddly she always seemed satisfied with her life even though it was going nowhere. She had met Andriana at a graduation party because Adriana had just graduated and Emily introduced her to weed, and they quickly became friends. 

One day she came to the empty classroom where me and my fake friends would hang out. I was high, and didn't particularly find her attractive (even though she was a stunning 5”10 brunette). I didn't really pay attention to her, but she did to me. I was wearing my studio headphones high as a kite producing a song when she came up to me and said, “I love your hair.” (I have brown curly hair). I took off my headphones and replied “What?” She repeated in a joking tone “I….Love…Your” “I get it” I replied as I laughed and thanked her. She asked to listen to the song I was working on and my attention needing self gladly obliged and gave her the headphones. She bobbed her head and laughed at the ridiculous lines I was singing (I never took my lyrics seriously). I laughed and got enthralled in a conversation with her. Even though she was stunning in every way, even though her personality was sadly beautiful, I wasn't sexually attracted to her at all. 

She asked me if I wanted to go to Emily’s car to smoke, and since by that point I wasn't high thirty minutes after smoking I gladly obliged and added “I have a really cool pipe.” She laughed and we went. We smoked so much, looking back now I know it was laced weed. I don't remember the rest of the day till I got home around 3pm that day.

I have two younger brothers Diego who is 8 and Ruben who is 13. I still live with both my parents who are in their 40’s. I love my mom and my dad, but I slowly started to notice that my dad wasn't the same person anymore. It wasn't a fast physical change or a sudden personality shift but more like when you are in your room in a dream. Maybe the roof is an inch too high or the architecture outside is non Euclidean but you know it's not your room. Anyways I was so high at the time I didn't mind, but today was a little different. He had grown a yellow hue to him.

My dad is a bald man who looks like Shrek in Shrek 2 when he is human, but bald. He has an explosive temper but is a noble and good person, but lately something felt off. He asked me to go into his room, and I saw some weird paintings I had never seen before of the nazi megadome they wanted to build. The welcoming yellow light in the room had been replaced by a clinical white light. He was wearing a black shirt that used to fit him but now looked two sizes too big. He looked down at the floor and said in a tone like he was holding back a cough “If I'm happy.”

I woke up in my room. It was night by then; I just blamed the laced weed and didn't think much of it. My mom called us downstairs for dinner, but my dad didn’t come downstairs. I never ate with the family. By that point my routine was smoking a bowl and eating in my room alone. My 13-year-old brother Ruben was a soccer and basketball prodigy at his school. Sports are what he loves so conversation always centered around them.

I hated sports, they always bored me. I resented sports because in Honduras soccer was everybody's common interest which left me outside of every social gathering since the third grade (since every hangout was either watching a game, playing FIFA, or playing soccer). It wasn't until my senior year in school when I started smoking weed and drinking that I was considered “cool to hang out with.” That made me depend on weed for social interactions and it became my personality. It was the only way I could make friends.

After enthusiastically going through dinner and not eating. My mom was staring at me with a dissonant sad stare all throughout. I went upstairs to smoke. I packed my bowl with my mix of 50% tobacco and 50% weed (which I would do to make it last longer), and I lit up. I always showered after smoking and eating so I wouldn't go to sleep smelling like two A.M. Mcdonalds. When I took off my shirt I noticed a small cut on my stomach, I didn't think much of it. I smoked again and drifted to sleep while watching The Sopranos.

**Animals**

The next day my routine started: 

1. Wake and bake
2. Shower and beat
3. Liquid breakfast (Coca-Cola Diet)
4. Get picked up by my friend in his 90’s Mercedes
5. Hot box
6. Listen to 100 Gecs and drive
7. Get to philosophy class

That was the only class I liked and looking back it's the only one I passed for two trimesters. This is because every man is a philosopher when they are stoned. They would ask me about Machiavelli, and I would pontificate using some anime or a black mirror episode as my basis. I got 95%. Anyways after that class was done Emily invited me to smoke in her 2008 Toyota Camry. Adriana was there and Emily started playing some really good house music as we got stoned. I said, “Let me play one of my songs.” Emily gracefully replied, “Fuck no!” but Adriana jumped at the suggestion. 

I was being pretentious and explaining the chord progressions I used and how doorways were metaphors for pussies when I felt Adriana squeeze my leg. It made me stutter while I was talking and deeply uncomfortable because I really didn't like her that way.  As the song ended, she showered me with compliments. We kept smoking for around thirty minutes when I realized I was out of weed. Emily gladly gave me 2 grams of Muppet fuzz (enough for one night back then), and said to me “Just be good to Adriana.” For some reason the way she said it made me really squeamish, as if it was something she needed from me for some reason. I thanked her and said goodbye and made my way back home.

As I got home my mom was in the entrance waiting for me and told me she would cut my allowance to $5 a week. She told me “I won't fund you killing yourself.” I started yelling at her in a blind rage, in my mind if I'm happy life is better for everyone. The debate was getting nowhere so I told her “I don’t need your money to kill myself.” She started crying, I went to my room. I started smoking when I felt a pain where the cut was yesterday. It felt deeper but I looked, and the wound was the same. I didn't think much of it. Nothing else eventful happened for the rest of the day except for Adriana texting me, and me not responding. A pattern that would keep its relevance. After my healthy sleeping ritual, I had a nightmare that night.

I was tied to a metal table in a room with white walls that had a yellow hue that were obviously stained due to cigarettes. I had studio lights around me and cameras. On the roof above me there was an old TV display, one of those giant CRTs. I heard a voice speaking through an intercom that said, “This show is being broadcasted to over one hundred thousand souls.” The display on the roof turned on to reveal a video feed of my 8-year-old brother Diego in the same situation, the only difference is that he was surrounded by two surgeons holding scalpels. I started yelling, as I did, a surgeon entered the room. The voice started again, and it said, “I will mention a body part and if you choose not to cut it off, you will watch as we cut it off Diego.” The surgeon looked at me and said, “Nod your head to say yes.” The voice said “Tongue.” At that moment I wasn't thinking about my dehumanization to preserve my brothers, all I could think about was not looking weak in front of one hundred thousand people. 

I nodded yes, and felt the surgeon stretch my tongue out with his index finger and thumb. I knew the last thing I would ever taste was clinical white latex. He slowly started cutting the base of my tongue with his scalpel. I was wrong, the last thing I tasted was steel and blood. He took his time alternating sides as he was cutting until there was only a strand left, he yanked. I saw my brother screaming and crying on the tv, he was watching a live feed of me. Body parts or not, he had lost his humanity.

At this point in the dream, I switched perspectives and became the showrunner in the control room. My assistant told me that this has been the highest viewership for any episode and that 2 new sponsors were on board. I looked at the mutilated bodies on screen, took a drag of my cigarette and looked at my wall of awards. I said to myself “If I’m happy.”

I woke up.

**Meddle**

The next day I went to college, the pain of the cut on my stomach kept increasing. I wasn't really on speaking terms with my parents to do anything about it. I just put a band aid over it so it would not bleed through my shirt and tried not to think about it. After philosophy class I went searching for Emily to smoke, but she wasn't in college. I texted her and she said she was having some “family problems” that day. I called Adriana to see if I could get some free weed from her and we went to the cafeteria to talk. She saw me sweating, I haven't smoked in 3 hours and was insanely anxious because of the dream. Adriana asked, “Are your parents home?” I responded in a shaky joking tone “Buy me a drink first at least.” She laughed and said, “No stupid, I could invite some friends over, you do the same, and we can smoke.” My eyes lit up.

My parents and brothers were gone for the day because they had to go to the school's spring festival. Diego was playing a trumpet solo at the end of the night. I didn’t even ask for permission, my dad wasn’t him, and I hated my mom for trying to take away the thing I needed. I told some friends to come over and she said she did the same. I called an Uber home with my dad’s card. We went to the basement in my house, a room with yellowish walls, no windows, a TV, and some paintings I had put up because I liked to smoke there with friends when my parents weren't home. I took out some bottles of cheap flavored rum and started setting up a plastic table when she said, “Gotta go piss.” I laughed because she said it in a sonic the hedgehog voice. 

As I kept on setting up the table I noticed a man shaped thing in the corner of the room. It was about six feet tall and was made out of burlap sack material. He had no features except for black eyes like a racoon. Even though it had no pupils I knew his eyes were following me as I continued to set up. As Adriana came out of the bathroom I said to her “Heard you in there pissing like a racehorse.” She laughed at the Sopranos reference, and I realized how much I loved having her as a friend. I started playing “Is this it” by The Strokes on the speaker I had plugged in, and we started taking shots and smoking together.

She told me “My friends aren’t coming.” She laughed, he twitched, and I was stressing out because my friends told me they couldn't make it. Emily was my best friend and gave me free weed. I wasn't getting any money at the time and knew deep down I could not risk losing my relationship with her. We kept drinking and smoking when I broke the news to her that my friends aren’t coming. A smile washed over her face as she turned to me and said, “I love how we had the same plan.” The booze and pot consumed me as Julian sang “We make pretend we were best friends.” and I kissed her. We kept smoking and had sex.

After she left, I went up to my room. When I closed my eyes, I knew he was an inch away from my face. I didn't open my eyes until the next day.

**A Saucerful of Secrets**

Two weeks Later.

My stomach pain was unbearable as I woke up to start my morning routine. I was still having nightmares about hedonistic narcissism, and my mom told me my dad would be gone for a couple of days. She said she wasn't sure if he was going to return, but in a sorrowful way, not like he didn't want to return, but like he couldn't. That day me and Adriana would take an Uber to Emily’s house. It was the first time either of us went. While we were in the uber making out I saw the sack man in the rear-view mirror’s reflection. I saw him every time we were together since the first day we kissed. We got to Emily’s house, and it felt desolate, dead and brown greenery surrounded it for miles with no other houses nearby. When we entered the house, it looked like nobody had lived there for months, the only sign of life was the muppet fuzz growing in the backyard. Emily entered the living room hitting a bong she had held in her left hand and said “I have a surprise.”

We went outside to a field next to her house, the sky had a yellow hue, it looked like Mexico in Breaking Bad. We sat crisscrossed in a circle, and she put her musty bong in the middle, pulled out a dropper and put some drops of something onto the bowl “Ready to see god?” Without even asking I hit the bong. I started coughing and heard echoed laughter, as I looked up they were both gone. I was confused and dizzy but I stood up to go to the house to look for them. As I headed in, the dusty gross atmosphere consumed me, and every room I entered downstairs was as desolate and abandoned as the last. I went upstairs and as I was climbing, I noticed a family portrait, she wasn't in it, this wasn’t her family. 

I found what I thought was her room. I knew this because of a sticker of a dog that said “pugs not drugs.” I went into her room and felt a breeze of fresh clean air. The room was spotless, it had freshly painted pink walls, AC, and TikTok neon lights. It had a worn beanbag and a neatly made bed with a journal on the top of it which read “Hair Changes.” I opened the journal and it read:

Blonde

11/24

* M - 42
* F - 36
* M -16
* M - 8

Next page

Blue

04/04

* M - 63
* F - 72
* F - 35
* F - 7
* M - 2
* F - 44

As I kept turning the pages it was the same pattern

like five more times. When I looked up from the journal, I noticed a painting of the nazi megadome, the same one from my dad’s room. The stabbing pain in my stomach intensified and I stumbled out of the room feeling sick for some reason I couldn’t explain. The musty mildewy atmosphere of the hallway hit me as I kept exploring. I remembered a quote a friend once told me “In horror movies, white people be investigating.” I laughed to myself and kept investigating. Colors started to look more vibrant and I started seeing eyes in weird places, whatever was in that bong really started really starting. 

I walked into a room to the left of Emily’s and heard muffled grunting, it smelled like death. There was a stroller with a decomposing baby in it and a hatchet lodged in its skull. I remembered the last journal entry “F-2”. On the wall behind him in the home that used to be filled with happy innocent life, written in dry blood read “If I’m happy.” I vomited immediately and felt the same flavor I had felt in my nightmare, steel and blood. I looked down and the vomit had chunks of coagulated blood and small steel shavings in it. The grunting got closer as a man dressed in a gimp outfit in shiny black leather came into my peripheral. The only opening the suit had was the mouth and as I looked to the corner of the room he was chained to the wall. He had two dog bowls in the corner; one filled with a yellow liquid and one with human genitals. As the gimp got to arms reach of the vomit, he started scooping up the gelatinous chunks of coagulated blood and stuffing them in his mouth as he made slurping noises and started moaning.

I ran out of the room and started running, the hallway seemed infinite. I kept running for what felt like days, and I started understanding the symbols that were appearing in my vision. Inverted triangles and indistinguishable symbols that sang to me like gross celestial hymns. When I finally got to the end of the hallway I jumped out of the second story's already cracked window. As I hit the ground my stomach pain intensified and I felt a pop. I was laying in her weed garden when I turned my head left and saw a box filled with dirt and decomposing body parts labeled “Compost”. I heard Emily’s voice say “Why’d you think the weed was so good?” She was standing to my right with a smile on her face. 

As I looked up to the sky, my consciousness drifting, I saw an ethereal being. It has four heads, all different creatures, and four sets of wings. It was as big as a mountain but looked mangled. For the first time in my life I felt welcomed.

I passed out.

**The Final Cut**

I was in my old school’s gym. It was a large building with two full size basketball courts, all painted blue. It smelled like rubber and axe body spray. Normally it was loud but today it felt like when you are stuck in school after hours because your parents are having some sort of problem. There were some kids playing volleyball in the next court over and on the far side of the gym I saw my 8 year old brother in a chair and my dad standing next to him unravelling something. As I got closer I saw a big stalagmite in front of the chair and my dad slowly wrapping my brother with the same cloth the sack man was made out of. He was mummifying him alive, and Diego kept asking my dad in a slightly distressed and scared tone “why are you doing this papa?” My dad kept responding in a cold way “Don’t worry moco, it’s just for a picture.” Diego kept naively saying “I hope it comes out good.” Like a dog sniffing a gun before he is shot by his owner. The stalagmite in front of him implied the worst, and for some reason I was stuck in place and couldn't do anything.

My older brother came out of nowhere and yelled “NO!” Pushed my dad to the ground and as my dad hit it he vanished. Ruben took all the wrappings of Diego and Diego started running towards the kids playing volleyball and yelled in a happy tone “This is a picture I actually want!” I started sobbing uncontrollably and could move again. I walked outside towards the cafeteria and could see that the whole skyline of the city was destroyed and everything looked post apocalyptic. As I walked towards the tables outside the cafeteria I saw the most beautiful redhead I had ever seen in my life. I knew deep down she was the love of my life. My crying intensified as she ran toward me and hugged me. I felt as welcomed as when I passed out. She said to me “Where have you been?” I responded “Looking for you.” She looked at me in the eyes and told me “Why are you crying baby?” I sorrowfully replied “I’ll never see you again” she gave a warm smile and said “You can.” and handed me an icepick with the handle engraved with the same symbols I had seen in Emily’s house.

I woke up crying in a hospital bed with my dad standing to my left. “You were out for a while, your stomach burst.” “I know,” I replied. He nodded and said “You have a visitor.” He left the room and Adriana walked in crying and telling me how worried she was and much she loved me. I knew she was telling the truth but I didn’t care. She told me Emily had given her a strong brownie but that I couldn't have any because of my condition. A smile was drawn on my face. She lied next to me in the hospital bed telling me how much she loved me as she drifted to sleep due to the edible. I felt a handle to my left under the bed sheets, as I pulled it out I noticed it was the same icepick from my dream. I gripped it tight and made a small cut in Adriana’s stomach. I whispered to myself,

“If I'm happy.”
