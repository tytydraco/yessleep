Somehow, my family always saw the worst in me.

As the eldest, a lot of things that are choices for those that come after you are decisions made for you. And, of course, you cannot object or be ungrateful. You were brought into this world and given the basic necessities. Kept fed. Alive.

Some feel like black sheep. I was the demon. The villain. Someone else was always the victim when the pain was mine to voice. 

Eventually, you find peace in silence and solitude.

But no amount of hardening up could have prepared me for those two instances. Years apart, yet so similar in nature.

A short while before my grandma passed away, her mind began to betray itself. The Alzheimers crept in, resting under the surface till it could rear its sinister head. A slow burn, where the descent is both plaguing and swift, capable of bending time.

She seemed to have a soft spot for me. Perhaps it was a dislike of my mother that allowed her to not be repulsed by me. I did not mind wiling the time away with her. What else would I have done?

That day, she and I were home alone. I was in the room I share with my siblings, when i heard a  bloodcurdling scream. Like a red-hot rod, it pierced my heart, reverberating within my very being. 

I ran into her room and found her struggling, thrashing, fighting off an invisible force. As soon as she saw me, her eyes widened in a mask of horror I had not known humans capable of wearing. 

"Maarna band kar!" she screamed in Urdu, indicating the entity to stop attacking her. 

"Kaun? Kaun maar raha hai," I countered, asking her who was responsible for the imagined assault, half-yelling myself. 

"Jo tere kandhe pe baitha hai," she said. 

"The one who's sitting on your shoulder."

A panicked scream escaped my lips. I rushed to call my father, begging him to return to tend to his mom. Begging someone to be home. By the time I returned to grandma's room, she had fallen asleep. 

That was ten years ago.

I believed it was behind me. The very thought that I had added to her terror made something sink inside me. 

When she passed, much worse off than that one day, yet without a similar incident, I thought the worst was over. 

My family looked at me and sneered, but at least they didn't scream bloody murder due to some man on my shoulder.

That was, until, ten years to the date, the cover of darkness chose a side.

It was around 4am. Incessant stomach pangs had made me weary and a spell of weakness was wreaking its havoc on basic functionality. I needed medicine, and so, I tiptoed into my parents' room, hoping to whisper my mother awake to bother her with my query. 

I had merely bent over her bedside when her eyes shot open, locking with mine. Her mouth instantly grew wide and she let out the most bone-chilling scream - a mix between begging for survival and genuine terror. 

"Ma, it's me!" I cried to no avail, as she kept wailing. My father awoke next to her, grunting angrily due to his disturbed slumber. He switched on the light, illuminating my face and thus, putting and end to my mother's frightened wails. 

"He was trying to choke me," she cried out throw labored gasps. 

"Who, ma?" I asked nervously. 

"The man on your shoulder," she replied.
