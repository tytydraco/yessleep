  Pardon my terrible story telling skills, never had them. I have never been a firm believer of the beyond. What I mean by the beyond is ghosts, monsters, demons, etc. It’s just a bunch of bullshit to me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fun to watch, but it’s obviously not real… well that’s what I used to think. You might think that’s the most common hook ever but just stick with me okay? 

  Anyway, I was around eleven and my mom just wanted to get rid of me for a week. She needed a little bit of alone time. She scoured the internet for summer camps, till she found the perfect one. Now I’m not gonna give out this camps name, because I don’t want them to get in trouble or anything, so I’m just gonna call it “Camp Fucking Haunted As Hell”

  I’m terrified, because I was a kid that was never left home alone, and never left the side of my parents, so imagine being gone for a week. We were on the way to the summer camp (in the middle of Tennessee) and everything was completely and utterly terrifying. Not because there were monsters in the sky chasing the car while the cartel were after us and there were ghosts blocking the road, I just didn’t wanna leave. I’m pretty sure I cried not gonna lie.

  I got there and it was very strange. The site was an abandoned apartment building. Me and my Urbex mind wanted to get in it immediately but of course the counselors wouldn’t let me. Little did I know the absolutely terrifying reason the apartment building went abandoned. But, in the beginning being on that site was a dream. It had a beautiful garden, a little plaza with a kitchen, a pool, and even a massive storage room. We didn’t stay anywhere close to the apartment building though, we were all the way in the back.

  There were two cabins for boys and girls, and each cabin had two sections for 11 and under and 12 and older. I was put into the boys younger section which was terrible because everyone else was like 8 or something and was just screaming whatever the equivalent was to Skibidi Toilet whatever that was back then. They also absolutely stank.

  Holy shit I’ve been yapping let’s get into the scary stuff. We had this friend, let’s call him Jack, and he was a C.I.T (counselor in training) and he was the son of the owner of the whole darn camp so he had tons of inside information. That night he tells us that two German woman were murdered in the basement of that building in the 80’s. The murderer was never found but is assumed dead because of his old age at the time of the killings. Also, before that, all the way back in the 60’s there was a fire the wiped out most of the forest and even some of the apartment building.

  Most of the kids in my section of the cabin were terrified to go to sleep, but me and my friends (let’s call them Mike and Action) were very interested in this story, so interested that we ended up yapping about it the girls cabin, and then the whole camp knew that someone spoke. I’m not sure if Jack got in trouble but we did. Someone told them that we were spreading it and we were told not to talk about it. We asked

“Is it true?”

  And she came around with a big… walk off. She just walked off. We basically knew that this place wasn’t good news and we were creeped. Also, the next day was a blood moon so that kinda made it 10 times worse. That day me, Mike, my friend (let’s call him Juan) and Jack all went for a hike on one of the many trials the camp had to offer. We found a strange totem pole looking thing. It wasn’t exactly a pole, it was more of just a 5 foot tall and 10 feet wide stone platform. It honestly looked like one of those graves you would find in New Orleans or something like that.

  It had many designs all over it but one thing caught our eye. The largest design on the front was a 3D stone wolf head. Keep that in mind for later. This was also right behind the cabins, also keep that in mind. We mostly just played around with it. We just hoped on top of the platform and we even drew stupid shit all over it with Juan’s sharpie. Eventually around dinner time we left to go to the cafeteria. Everything was pretty normal and fun till that night. We were lying in our beds when we heard a bunch of noises come from behind the cabin. What were these noises? Freaking HOWLS and not just one like a whole pack and it was coming from the platform that had a WOLF HEAD on it.

  When we thought back on what it looked like, it didn’t seem too far off from a summoning platform. Not to mention a group of girls thought they saw a cult I mean I’m not sure (I don’t believe those girls). Anyway, we made a bunch of theories like maybe there was a cult or that was really a summoning platform and also the fact that the blood moon was the next day,  I mean wolf+moon usually means werewolf but like I said, I did not believe in monsters so I was a huge sceptic on that. The next day played out nice, Jack even let us into the apartment building. Action had one of those EMF readers and Jack installed one of those spirit box apps on his phone but none of it worked. The spirit box was speaking a different language and the EMF reader only worked in the basement. That’s when everyone had a holy shit moment. The murders happened in the basement and that different language we are hearing? Yea, that was German.  Now I don’t believe those spirit box apps but just the fact that it was German was kind of a huge coincidence.

  That night was the blood moon, and that night was the night where I realized monsters exist. That night we looked out a windows and were absolutely terrified about what we saw, it was a man. This man looked almost homeless. He had raggedy clothes on and just looked nasty. Jack and the other C.I.Ts immediately reported this to the camp officer but not until the man could get inside an abandoned barn. The officer, along with 2 policemen rushed into the barn and we heard a gunshot. The killed something, and that something was a wolf.

  Now we had eyes on the barn the whole time, and we had eyes on the only entrance/exit of the barn and the guy never left. They said they searched the whole thing and only found the wolf. Nothing eventful happened the rest of the week, and I even went a second year, and some crazy haunted shit happened there but I’m late to my dinner plans so I have to get going. But I know what I saw tonight, it was man, it wasn’t a wolf, I saw a man that night, I saw a werewolf that night.
