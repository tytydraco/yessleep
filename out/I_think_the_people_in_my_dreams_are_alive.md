Or conscious in some way? I don’t know how to describe it. They’re just… real.

It all started when my doctor prescribed a new drug to help with my Insomnia.

For some context, ever since I was a kid, I’ve had an overactive imagination. I haven’t been tested for anything, but I really feel like I have some sort of condition that makes my brain this way.

I recall being able to control my dreams for what felt like days in the dream world as a kid. Nowadays I still have really vivid dreams, but I don’t bother trying to control them anymore.

“Take one of these three hours before bed,”

my doctor explained. My doctor went on about the potential side effects of the drug. I zoned out for most of it until I heard my doctor say

“Hyper-vivid dreams are normal.”

Now that piqued my interest, my overactive imagination on top of a drug that can cause vivid dreams? I thought I might just enter the fourth dimension.

I was still thinking about what the doctor said when I rolled into bed that night. Would the vividness stack? Would my dreams feel more real than real life? I was honestly pretty excited to find out.

The drug worked great by the way, I was knocked out in under 15 minutes. My first dream with the drug was an interesting one.

I found myself in the center of a massive city I didn’t recognize. I was in a busy crossing, standing on concrete facing a backed up road with car traffic. The skyscrapers rivaled the tallest I had ever seen. There were digital advertisements everywhere, and the foot traffic shook the ground itself.

The cold afternoon smell flowed naturally into my nostrils. I knew I was dreaming right away. I was honestly somewhat disappointed; the experience wasn’t at all different from a typical dream I had in my childhood.

Indistinguishable from reality, sure, but not anything I hadn’t already experienced. Still, I hadn’t felt this way in a long time. I tried to control what happened around me like old times. I tried to fly but ended up just jumping. I tried to stop time – which used to be a favorite of mine – but all I received were some weird looks from the afternoon rush crowd.

That’s when I noticed the first thing that distinguished this dream from the ones in my childhood.

The dream people were oddly detailed.

There were hundreds of people all around me with unique faces, constantly being replaced with new faces I hadn’t seen before. Now that I think about it, I can’t remember ever seeing a crowd in any of my dreams, too many faces for my brain to process, I guess.

Could the drug have caused this?

I took note of that oddity and continued exploring.

I walked into a fast-food joint with a name I didn’t recognize. I wanted to see how dream food tasted. So, I walked up to the young girl at the register and ordered myself a burger and fries.

“Your total is $9.25 sir.”

“So, there’s currency in this dream?”

I thought to myself. I tried to materialize money into my hands. It worked back in my childhood, but for some reason I just couldn’t. I never thought much about the people I would see in my dreams as a kid, just decoration in my playground.

But now, it felt like there was an awkward silence between me and this girl when I didn’t have any money. There was a sense of tension that felt real, unlike the numerous interactions I used to have with dream people.

“I-I forgot my wallet”

I stammered. I tried walking away, when someone put their card into the receiver and paid for my meal.

“Happens to the best of us.”

I turned around and met the gaze of a tall man, he was wearing khaki pants with a flannel vest over a black T-shirt. He was on the bigger side too, orange hair and a long beard, looked like he was in his mid-30s.

“T-Thanks”

I shot the word out with a silencer. I had never been in a dream so detailed, especially not one I couldn’t control.

When I received my food, I looked for a place to sit, I saw the orange-haired man in a windowed booth in the corner of the place. I walked over apprehensively and sat down parallel to him in the booth.

“You know you’re in my dream, right?”

The words came out more confidently this time. I realized that I had no reason to be nervous because none of it was real anyway.

“Excuse me?”

“This is a dream, and you’re a character in it.”

I’ve had experience telling dream people they aren’t real. I used to do it all the time in middle school. In fact, I remember getting into debates with people over whether they were in my dream. But there was always one question dream people couldn’t answer.

“What time is it?”

I have no idea why, but no dream character had ever been able to tell me the time and then prove it. Sometimes I’d get a shrug, other times they’d say some arbitrary number like “64”, but nobody could ever tell me the time.

The man chuckled a bit while unwrapping his sandwich.

“This is real life, unfortunately.”

“Oh yeah, tell me the time.”

I smirked at the man, wondering what nonsense answer I’d receive. I was now confident that this dream was just like any other I used to have.

“It’s 5:45. Well, 5:43 but same difference.”

I raised my eyebrows, and my smirk was quickly washed away in a sea of surprise.

“Show me.”

I regained my confidence, figuring it was just random chance or something. The man showed me his phone screen. His wallpaper was a selfie of him at the beach, he wore sunglasses, the sun was setting behind him, and under the beam of light was a little girl maybe 3 or 4.

The time on his phone was 5:43. The sun outside corroborated his answer. I began to look for other ways to prove to this dream person that he wasn’t real.

“How did you get here?”

“I left work which is on seventh, and stopped for a burger on my way to the subway.”

“Where did you grow up?”

“Outside Detroit, I moved here for work.”

“Who’s that on your phone screen?”

“Lucy, she’s my daughter.”

The man looked visibly frustrated with me now. But it was subtle, as though he was trying to be polite, but was bad at hiding how tired he was with me and my questions. I finally asked.

“Are you alive?”

“Yes?”

The man responded in a confused tone.

Most dream characters fail to create any semblance of a backstory for themselves, at least whenever I was interrogating them in my childhood.

This man felt too real. It got under my skin how realistically he answered my questions, the subtlety of the emotion on his face, the detail in his apparent personality, the way he seemed to know things I didn’t. I had to find out more.

“Sorry to bother you, thanks again.”

I walked away before he could respond. I wandered the streets, still unable to control my surroundings, After what felt like hours of exploring, I woke up.

I slept for 12 hours, right through my alarm apparently. Whatever this drug was, it worked a bit too well. I work from home, so being late wasn’t a problem.

Throughout the day I never stopped thinking about that man in my dreams, about the faces passing by, about the girl at the register of the fast-food place.

I looked at it almost like a challenge at first. How could I get one of these dream people to crack? How do I undeniably prove that these dream people aren’t conscious?

While doing some research I found a study about dream characters from the 80s, it was a test of dream character consciousness.

The study performed a test; participants would lucid dream and ask a dream character how many fingers they were holding behind their back.

In real life, people would answer correctly 9% of the time. In dreams, it was more like 70% of the time. The conclusion was that dream characters – no matter how real they feel – are simply extensions of your own mind, because they know things only you would know. Therefore, they aren’t thinking on their own.

I went to bed early that night, I took the same drug three hours before bed, and went to sleep even faster than the night before.

This time I was taken to a completely new place. The towering skyscrapers were replaced by buildings that were no more than a few stories high. I found myself in a field that looked to be some kind of park.

In front of me was a large metal tower of some kind, it was the tallest man-made thing in the surrounding area, its base was made up of four legs, that led to a sharp singular point.

I recalled my goal. Luckily, there were plenty of people around to perform the test on. I was met with many confused looks and some people flat out ignored me.

The first person I successfully dug up an answer from guessed wrong. So did the second, and the third, the fourth, fifth, sixth. It wasn’t until the 12^(th) person that somebody got it right.

I tried exactly one-hundred times on one-hundred people. 9 people got it right. 9% odds. The exact odds real people had.

I was dumbfounded, somehow, the drug had made my dream characters indistinguishable from real people. Were they real people? The evidence was lining up in favor of that ridiculous conclusion.

The finger behind the back trick was only test number one for me. I began researching more ways to prove that these people in my head weren’t real.

The more I dreamt over the weeks the more I became convinced that these people were somehow alive... I know it sounds completely crazy but I ran more tests, and so far they haven’t failed any.

I’ve tried everything, I asked a dream character that was supposedly a professor of quantum mechanics to tell me a fact I didn’t know about the subject. He told me something I never knew, and when I awoke, I searched up his fact and it turned out to be true.

I once tried breaking the law and I actually got arrested and processed for jail time, fingerprint scanner, data records and everything. These people seem to have their own society here.

I watched full movies in the dream that didn’t exist, read books that didn’t exist, learned philosophy and science that people in my own world hadn’t thought about.

And I still haven’t been able to control anything.

It’s gotten to the point now where just one dose of the drug doesn’t work, I have to take 2-3 in order to get the same effects.

It’s been months since I’ve gone outside, my once clean kitchen is now lined with empty bottles of the drug, I’ve lost 30 pounds, I spend an average of 16 hours a day sleeping now.

I’ve performed hundreds of tests, hundreds! They’ve passed with flying colors every single time! I don’t know what to think anymore, have they always existed in my mind? Have they woken up solely because of the drug?

I don’t know.

I don’t know what else to do. So, I’ll keep experimenting with these conscious beings in my head. I think the drug is slowly killing me, my skin looks terrible, I feel sharp pains in my chest, I don’t care. I need to know the truth.

This post is my 320^(th) test. My question to you is...

*Are you alive?*
