I may have uncovered something that’ll send me on a trip through a forest. My friend and I are going to begin our search a week from now, so I’m here to detail what I found out, and how I found it. It all started some time back in January. I had recently returned home to my moms house after college, ( I had failed a course from the year earlier and had to retake that course in the fall), so I was finally back home. 

We were in this little town near Athabasca, just one of the dozens of lesser known towns here in Alberta, sure to be forgotten by the rest of our province if that’s not already the case. It was probably the first week of my return. I noticed one of the neighbours houses nearby had police tape strewn across it which wasn't there the last time I visited my mom on Thanksgiving. 

All I’ve ever known about those neighbours is that they were meth heads, consisting of some guy and his girlfriend, and another friend of theirs from the Northwest Territories. We never talked at all, so given the few stories my mom told me about them like how they stole the weed plant another neighbour grew or how the meth heads would park this RV of theirs in peoples yards without asking, I could gather that they were a bunch of weirdos whose days were numbered. 

Curious about what got the police to finally do them in, I went to ask my mom about what they did, the conversation going something like this; 

“Hey mom, why is there a bunch of police tape around the neighbours house?” 

“Oh? They killed someone.” I received as a brief answer. 

This surprised me, so wanting to know what else happened I asked something among the lines of, “Who’d they kill and why?” 

“I don't know. Police sirens woke me up one night, and I looked out the patio door to see the police arresting them and bringing a body bag out.” 

“Jesus, are you sure it wasn’t like, an overdose or something?” I remember asking. 

“Maybe, I don't know all that much. They were doing some strange things leading up to the arrest, I think I heard them digging and driving around town at night back in fall.” 

More questions came with all this new information, however, my mom had nothing else to say as that was all she knew. Still, my curiosity had now been peaked, and being bored and unsure what to do with my time, I wanted to figure out what happened. 

My personal investigation started, and unfortunately for me, this was a fresh case so anytime I’d try to look into something online there wouldn’t be much in the way of information about what happened. The only thing I could learn was how the guy from the Northwest Territories killed the other guy's girlfriend for some reason, and the boyfriend tried to help dispose of the body by storing her in a deep freeze, but they got caught somehow regardless. He may have also had a hand in her death because she was severely beaten and cut up, but the information wasn't conclusive. 

Learning all this disturbed me at the time, knowing how close the murder occured to my moms house and how recent this was. It felt kind of ghostly too, I never knew the neighbours all that well but I did see them and made small talk with them a couple times. Knowing what happened and seeing the house across the road, yeah.

Despite the slightly clearer picture of what happened, none of the information mentioned the digging or them driving around town. I first talked with my mom about it, asking where she heard the digging or where she saw them driving, but the only thing I learned was that they only had a rusty blue car that most people in town recognized, and that the digging came from the trees near our house. Snow blanketed the ground at this point of the year, so it wasn’t like I could just look for any signs of a hole at the moment. Regardless of this minor setback, I decided to look into them driving around town until the snow melted and the ground softened up. 

A few months went by with me going around town and occasionally talking to people about the meth heads. When I could, I’d just start up small talk with people here and there about the meth heads which was easy given this town's small population and their unruly reputation. 

Some of the stories I heard didn’t help that much, being just small things about how the meth heads would steal or inconvenience the people around town. Some of the stories, however, lined up with the fall events. Generally, people knew about the arrest, to the whole town it meant they didn't have these annoying people stealing or messing with things anymore. Only a select few actually noticed strange things in fall. There were a few stories about people noticing the meth heads driving around at night, and this one dude I met actually explained how he tried to observe what they were doing. 

He told me he was outside smoking at two in the morning for some reason when he noticed the meth head’s car driving around. It had only one of the meth heads in it, the guy from the Northwest Territories, and the dude telling me this story discreetly followed the car for a short distance before they went out of sight. After asking him which direction they drove, he gave me his best recollection of where the car went. 

Ignoring why he followed them and now having a lead, I went to the area the car reportedly drove through. I took my time looking for someone who may have seen them that night, and it didn't take long for me to do so. There was this little house I passed by that an older lady lived in, Mary. She’s a sweet old lady, and my mom and I actually helped with her garden last summer. I knew the meth heads had to have done something here because this little public library she had next to the sidewalk was destroyed. It was this little wooden box that had a “take one leave one” system for books in her front yard, and it was unfortunately smashed. Its wreckage laid depressingly next to her fence, a little sign in its old place saying, “Public library closed”. 

I knocked on her door, Mary answering with a happy smile. 

“Oh hello, I didn't know you were back in town.” 

“Hey Mary, I’m back. How's things?” I replied, setting aside my investigation momentarily to enjoy a moment with her. 

“I’ve been living well, even with all the snow. How are you?” 

“Surviving. I was passing by and I noticed that your public library was broken, what happened?” 

I think she looked over at it sadly, taking a moment to think before saying, “Oh, do you know your neighbours?” 

“The meth heads?” 

“Yes, them. One of them, the religious one I think, broke it.” 

Happy that I got some confirmation that this was them, I asked, “Why did he break it? Was he just driving by some afternoon and decided to break it?” 

“Oh no… I was sleeping when I woke up to a noise as it was still dark out. I wanted to see what the ruckus was and got out of bed to look, and there was that man out there stomping the door of the box open.” 

“Isn’t that thing always unlocked?” 

“It is. He had no need to break it open but it did. He grabbed some books out of there and drove away. Now, I didn't call the police because I have enough worries in life and the books were free anyway, but I’ll have to make a new library one of these days. If you wanted one of the books from there I can grab one for you.” 

If the meth head stole multiple books, maybe there was a theme with them that mattered. She did say he was religious. 

Thinking this,  asked, “What kind of books did you have in there?” 

“Oh, I had a variety of books. There were some kids books but I don't think you’d want those. I also had these adventure books and Native American books, they were good reads but the Native ones were taken. He left the bibles I had in there, I was sure he would have taken them as a religious man, but he shouldn't have taken anything at all if he was.” 

“Huh. Sorry, but none of those are for me. I hope you're able to fix your public library though, shame some people are out of their minds these days.” 

“It is a real shame, thanks for stopping by.” 

After our chat, I left to continue my investigation. Unforunately, nothing else came up for a while. More weeks passed as I tried to piece together what their drive amounted to besides the book theft. Things went cold, and I slowly drifted away from the investigation as I stopped learning new things, on top of not being able to do much with finding the hole in the snow. That was, until I was at the local 24 hour gas station. 

The clerk was named Terrance, the night shift clerk, and we both knew each other on a first name basis. We would chat whenever I stopped by to get drinks, and on this one early morning I was there for an energy drink. Terrance was still on the night shift hours, and during our conversation he said something like, “You know, that's the same drink the meth addict would buy all the time.” 

This perked me up, my investigation coming back to me. 

“Did they ever come by in the fall? Like, around the time that Mary’s public library was broken?” I inquired. 

“I did have a weird ass encounter with one of them around then, how'd you know?” 

“I’ve been trying to figure out why they were doing some weird stuff around my house. Did the one from the Northwest Territories drop in the same night he broke Mary’s library?” 

“I don’t know if it was the same night, but I think the addict you’re talking about did come in to get an energy drink at 4 am. He did some strange stuff when he stopped by.” 

“Like what?” 

Terrance took a moment to recall the night, eventually saying, “He was all twitchy, scratching his arms and staggering around, the usual methed up stuff. After stumbling around like a jackass and knocking stuff over, he finally found the fridge with drinks and he grabbed an energy drink. He did some weird shit where he breathed on the glass door and marked some odd, star-like sigil in the condensation.” 

“Why?” 

“I dont know, I didn’t ask. He was probably just fucked up.” 

“Could you draw out what it looked like?” I requested. 

“Sure, why not.” 

After our talk, he drew out this sigil, at least a vague recreation from his memory for me. I took it home to try and figure out what it could mean while I waited for the snow to melt and ground to soften. The best I could come up with, given my perception of what the rattled mind of a druggy who would later become a murderer could think, was that the sigil was used for marking things of importance. It’s the best I could theorize given the brief interaction Terrance had. 

Later on in mid April when the snow was finally gone and I could actually work on looking for the spot the meth head was digging, I grabbed a shovel and began to search the trees near my moms side of the house. Sigil in hand, I searched the general, checking around for something marked with a similar sigil. I checked living trees, fallen trees, rocks, whatever could have something drawn on them. Sure enough, after an hour or so of searching, I finally found a little sigil carved into the base of a tree. The sigil Terrance drew wasn’t dead accurate to the sigil I found, but they were similar enough for me to assume the meth head made it. 

It didn't take long for me to dig the area up, finding a plastic garbage bag beneath all the dirt. I remember being worried for a moment, thinking that there would be a body part in there. Opening the bag, I found nothing of the sort, rather, I found a plastic baggy with crystals in it (I could assume what those were), a surprisingly small amount of money which was just a wad of $30 in $5 bills that I pocketed (Not sure why he’d hide that low amount of cash), and a note book full of nonsense. It was one of those small, pocket sized notebooks with the majority of the pages ripped out. What few pages that were left contained a bunch of nonsensical ramblings. 

The best way I could describe the ramblings was the writer jotting down events or thoughts of theirs, before immediately stopping and changing the direction of whatever he was writing. The best example of this were these sentences talking about shine in the trees and those who guard it, before switching to the fear of the girlfriend knowing about the provinces serenity and wanting to steal it, then switching to rambling of the weighted bag and sparkles of the water, whatever the Hell that could’ve been.

At the time, it kinda freaked me out, just getting a vague look into the mind of a drugged out guy who would soon be involved with a murder, but it was over. I found out why the guy was driving around at night, and what was hidden in a hole he dug. That was, until Easter Sunday came around. 

My friend Wyatt had finished his last college course a week before so I invited him out to the town to hang out, drink some beer together, and just enjoy Easter. The two of us were drinking and talking, and of course the topic of the meth heads came up. I explained what happened and what I had found, and we talked about what all this could possibly mean. A few beers later, and we were then looking at the taped off house across the street from us,  and discussing searching it. 

I’d never seen any police enter the house since I’ve moved back, and motivated by liquor and the thirst for adventure, we decided to break in. We grabbed flashlights, knives and a wood cutting axe just in case we had to defend ourselves, gloves to hide our fingerprints, and we both dawned a couple bandanas over our face just in case anyone saw us enter it. It was dark out so it was unlikely, but we were paranoid about being caught doing dumb stuff while drunk. 

We snuck over to the house, crouching under the police tape and approaching the front door. It was locked, of course, so we entered the back yard. Obviously, the back door was also locked, but it was worth checking just in case. We figured we had to find an unlocked window, which was surprisingly easy to do since we managed to find a window that was already broken open. The majority of the glass was outside so we figured the meth heads smashed it from the inside, maybe when the murder took place. 

The window led into the bathroom which looked to be in terrible condition. The elements had taken its toll on the interior of the bathroom, but I’m confident it was already wrecked way before being exposed to the outdoors. Dozens of shampoo bottles and empty toilet paper rolls riddled the ground, a small mountain of them resting in the corner. Mold was along the shower wall, decorating it in a revolting black pattern. Various brown colours of grime had crawlen around different parts of the bathroom, especially the sink area. There were obvious signs of both spiders and ants taking up residence in the corners of this bathroom, fortunately there weren’t any signs of life at the moment. The mirror was broken, and what looked like lipstick was used to write something on the mirror before it was shattered. Upon entering the bathroom, the two of us looked at the shards in the sink, piecing together the word, “Serenity”. 

Upon seeing that and remembering the notebook I found, I said something like, “You think that's about the girlfriend or just from some kind of drug hallucination?” 

“I don't know, these guys seem nuts. Do you think they broke the mirror and window when the murder happened.” 

“Probably.” 

The bathroom door was shut, so we opened it, entering the hall of the house. Almost immediately this rotten smell hit me, my bandana doing its best to help me breathe. Darkness consumed the entirety of this house, our lights breaking it apart as we trekked over the garbage piled up around us. Every room we passed by had heaps of worthless junk piled into small mountains, a gross mark of this being a hoarders home.

Wyatt, being the braver of us two, went ahead first. He had the axe cocked back as he walked down the hall in the direction of the living room, him uttering something like, “What the fuck dude…”, upon entering. Entering the living room after him, I was stunned too. 

Off to my right side was the kitchen which was attached to the living room. Rotten food was placed on the counters, and a bunch of garbage was overflowing from this trashcan that hadn't been emptied in God knows how long. All the drawers and cabinets were open, the contents dumped onto the ground into one pile of ceramic shards and unclean cutlery. The kitchen sink had a massive pile of rotting dishes and a water puddle stain around the floor near it. A table was flipped onto its side, one of the chairs next to it broken with what I assumed to be dried blood splattered along one of the broken legs. 

When I turned to my left to see what the rest of the living room was like, I could see the couch, coffee table, TV, and more piles of useless junk and garbage. Each step we took into the living room crunched plastic bags beneath our boots or rolled empty bottles around. The furniture in the living room was shifted around at awkward angles, as if they got shoved around in a scuffle. A bunch of books and ripped up papers were spread around the living room, some pages from the books taped along the walls. 

I didn't care about those though, I was focused on the dozens of pieces of papers taped to the walls instead. Spread across the walls of the living room were scribbled drawings and insane notes, similar to the ramblings I found buried in the notebook. It was more unhinged stuff, talking about the weighted bags or the shine hidden and guardians in the trees. There were some foreboding notes that were likely made before the murder, and I could tell because they were written like, “She’ll harm serenity” or “It must stay there”. Some of the pieces of paper came from the same notebook I found containing similar ramblings I’ve seen, however some of the bigger pieces of paper taped on the walls had some new material I hadn’t encountered. 

These new pieces of paper were art, drawings. They weren't well made by any means, each was hastily drawn in pencil and were made up of messy lines intertwined to form silhouettes of whatever was being presented. A few were poorly made sketches of some character waving, some were of spiders, a couple were of some lanky dude, etc, just a bunch of random shit. 

The only thing that stood out to me were these drawings that seemed to be connected. They were the only ones that were taped to the wall next to each other, and they seemed to form a location that was probably important to the meth head. It was this hastily drawn picture of a house, some arrangements of wobbly lines which Wyatt somehow realized was a map of our country's Western provinces with landmarks and the same sigil I’d seen before. There were also some notes saying things like, “Serenity stays here”. 

Wyatt and I grabbed these drawings, taking them with us as we left to discuss what this all meant. Little progress was made that night in our drunken haze, but the next day we started on figuring out what all this meant. It was a rough map with a sigil that the meth head used to mark things important to him, so we could assume something was there, likely a cabin. Based on the province borders, even with how terribly they were drawn, it looked like this cabin was located in the Northwest Territories, the same province the religious meth head was from. There were a few landmarks aside from the sigil, likely roads, rivers, mountains, and possible towns. 

As to what was in the cabin, we don’t know. We spent the day trying to figure out where the sigil marked and what was in the cabin, and we never came up with a definitive answer for either. The best we could make out was the mountains of the Nahanni National Park which had a history of gold panning in the rivers there, and with that, we guessed that the “weighted bag” and “shine of the woods” was gold, likely stored in the cabin. Like, maybe a lot of gold, perhaps enough for us both to make a handsome profit off of.

We just needed to figure out how to get to the cabin and where it could be located, and we didn't figure it out for around a month of us both trying to analyze these terribly drawn landmarks and comparing them to google maps. Our verdict was that the cabin was built alongside a river South-West of the Camsell Bend. If we were to drive up to the village of Fort Simpson and follow the Mackenzie River upstream until we reached the bend, we could continue the journey on foot, following the river until we reached the cabin where there would be gold free for the taking. 

Now, I know it may belong to the meth head, but he's a murderer, it's not like he needs it anymore or deserves it. The cabin also may not even exist, but we’d be surrounded by beautiful untouched forests and cliffs, so if there is no gold it’ll just be a fun trip for the two of us to explore and camp in an amazing forest. 

Wyatt was concerned about the notes talking about those who guard the shine or whatever, and being from a hunting family he wants to take some of his guns along with us. I was worried about the extra weight, but two guns couldn't hurt. We could come across a grizzly or cougar afterall, as rare as those attacks are. 

We’re dead set on doing this, taking a short vacation to drive up to Fort Simpson and hike our way to get some meth heads gold. I do have concerns regarding some folklore I heard about the valley and people who sought gold there in the past, but that was all decades ago and I’m sure whatever murderer there has long since passed. Wyatt told me it could be supernatural, but I don't believe it due to the lack of definitive proof of indigenous demons or the wendigo or whatever else could be haunting the woods. 

So yeah, soon we’ll head up to this supposedly haunted valley based on some clues we got from a murderer. Is it greedy? Yeah. Will it be fun for us? Definitely. I'll probably provide you all an update on what happens when it’s all over. Peace.
