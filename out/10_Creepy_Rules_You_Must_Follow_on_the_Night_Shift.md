When I arrived at the gas station for my first shift, the place looked normal. It was one of those standalone gas stations with a generic name, Star Gasoline. It was clearly family-owned. It was a bit run down, but it was in good condition. Only one car was currently pumping gas.

 The gas tanks were lit by a single yellow light that hung in the center, casting shadows in all four directions. The actual convenience store part of the gas station was typical. The glass windows were plastered with sun-bleached advertisements for... For 99 cents, you could buy cigarettes, energy drinks, and two hot dogs.

I pushed open the convenience store door. I heard a bell ring when I did. I smelled old hot dogs. They had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. There was no one at the counter. There was a lady in her 50s at the back of the store. She was sweeping up. The store was a little larger than It was a typical gas station convenience store. The inside was what you would expect, except for one thing: there was a clock and an old TV screen on each side of the room. 

They were showing security camera footage of the gas pumps. It seemed unnecessary. Also, the owners didn't aim the security cameras very well. They mostly showed footage of the ground between the gas pumps in the store, instead of centering the gas pumps in the middle.

"Hello, you must be Alex." I looked forward. My husband originally interviewed you. We've been trying to find someone to work the night shift for months. I'm getting too old to stay up that late, but you're young, so you'll be fine.

She wiped her hands on her pants before reaching out her hand to shake mine.

"I'm Ann. Nice to meet you. You can set your things behind the counter, and I'll show you around. I know you've already worked at..." There used to be a gas station there, but I won't go into detail. We just needed someone who knew how to follow instructions. The little lady moved quickly for someone her size. She seemed eager to get me started so that she could finally go home and sleep.

Cleaning supplies are back here in this closet. Mops and brooms are hung on the left. The bathroom is on the right. It has one toilet. I looked inside. The bathroom was just what I expected a gas station bathroom to look like.

The walls were all scratched up from people probably drawing their initials on them, and the tiles had a nasty brown stain from years of use. But it smelled clean, like bleach, and there was hand soap, which wasn't always a guarantee.

 I'll give you a list later with the cleaning tasks and when to do them, since you'll be closing up. Finally, she led me back to the front, showed me how to use the cash register. She registered and used the debit card machine, and we were almost finished. She dug into her pockets and pulled out a pair of keys. "These are the keys to lock up. One for the front, and one for the back door. 

Near your chair at the register, there's a yellow list of the cleaning tasks. The most important one is the red sheet. She pointed at the bright red paper sitting next to the register. Read that and learn it by heart, and you'll have no problems. Thanks. I'll take a read. Did you?" Bring a good watch, like I told you.

Yes, I did.

But it looks like you have so many clocks in here.

I feel like I don't really need this watch to tell the time.

Oh, no, you'll definitely need it.

Trust me.

You've got another 15 minutes before your shift starts.

Go sit down and start on some of those tasks.

Keep it with you for a few days.

You'll know it by heart soon enough.

I don't need it anymore.

I Lear. She quickly picked up her bags from behind the counter and left. There were no customers, and it was quiet. It was almost 10 p.m., and there were no cars on the road outside. I looked outside again at the gas station light, which flickered occasionally in the distance. The light illuminated the long shadows of the gas pumps, all four shadows pointing in the same direction towards the convenience store, almost like they were crawling towards the [building.to](http://building.to) be continued......
