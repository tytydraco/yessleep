I remember the private show I did for him like it was yesterday.

“Hey baby,” I said. “Turn your camera on so I can see you.”

On it went. His face was half-hidden. Like anonymous 60 Minutes interviewees shrouded in darkness who speak through a voice changer. His room cast more shadow than light.

“What do you want me to do?” I asked him.

I could hear him breathing. It was halting and shallow like all first-timers’.

“I’m Betto,” he said. His voice cracked when he spoke.

“Betto,” I said. I pursed my lips and batted my eyes. “Hot outside today. You inside trying to keep cool?” I was setting up a punchline; “I’m going to get you hot”, that sort of thing.

“I live in Florida,” he said, ruining it. Well then, a local boy. I almost asked if he lived down the block from me in Pensacola.

“Is this your first private show, baby?” I tucked my feet to one side under my thighs, angled my cleavage toward the camera.

“Do you—” He suddenly clothespinned his tongue.

“What?” I said. “You can ask me whatever you want.”

He nodded the way people do when they grasp a new foreign concept. “Do you go where you want to, when you want to go there?”

It was a weird question. But strange solicitations are a cam girl’s stock-in-trade.

“Mostly,” I said. “I went to Six Flags last week.” Which was true. It’s easier to tell the truth, especially when you’re lying. The best way to get a man who watches sex shows on camera to like you is by sharing tidbits he thinks no one else gets. Tell the small truths of your life inside your performance’s Big Lie. 

The More You Know.

“What is ‘Six Flags’?”

Was he foreign? Probably. His voice had a lilt that hinted at internationality without flashing his passport outright.

“It’s an amusement park,” I said. “You know—rollercoasters, water slides, the ferris wheel. Tea cups for the kiddies. Cotton candy, popcorn. You’ve never been to Six Flags?”

He breathed heavy and rubbed his palms on his jeans, hands probably slick with sweat. An audio notification chirped on my laptop. He’d dropped a thousand tokens in my purse—fifty real American dollars—not bad.

“Oh my God, baby, thank you,” I said. “Very generous.” I reached back to remove my bikini top.

“No,” he said. “Don’t.”

I stopped. “You don’t want to see me?”

He lapsed into silence I didn’t know needed breaking, until it was too late to break it.

“Did you see people there?” he said after a while.

“See people…”

“At Six Flags.”

I smiled. Sure, “Betto” kind of gave me the creeps. But money’s a lasting reason to smile. 

“Did you see people there?” He repeated himself, either with excitement or impatience.

“Sure, lots of people. You know, teenagers, families with their kids. Some by their lonesome. I was one of those.” 

“One of what?”

I frowned. “A loner.” I guess I didn’t like saying it out loud.

But it was true. Movies, concerts, theme parks—the world opens up when you choose to experience life without company.

He smiled like he was trying it on for the first time. One side of his mouth sat higher than the other, and the higher side’s lip’s corner reached up to his cheek. Betto’s cheekbones barely had flesh on them.

“I’m a loner, too. A real big loner. Do you have secrets?”

I was about to redirect him, but then he dropped a thousand tokens. Two-hundred dollars. I felt dopamine flushing through my body. Okay, we’d talk about secrets.

“Everybody has secrets,” I said. “Of course I have secrets, too.”

Betto shuddered and licked his lips. His tongue was a different shape than mine. “Do you have secrets about—” He stopped himself again.

“Yeah?” I tried to sound flirty, but my nerves jangled and I came off as impatient. I tried again. “Do I have secrets about…?”

“Do you have secrets about you and other people?”

“Yeah, sure. Doesn’t everyone? Don’t you, baby?” More tokens went into my account. I didn’t bother to say thanks; it would’ve just slowed down the time it took to pull him out of his shell.

“I want to hear you tell me your secrets. I want to hear other people’s secrets about other people. Have you ever been in a line?” 

“I don’t have any secrets I can think of to tell you right now,” I said. “What kind of line?”

“Everybody has secrets,” he said, and it sounded just like when I said it.  He brought a lowball glass to his lips and drank something the color of red wine but that wasn’t—it sloshed slow and heavy around his glass. Like syrup. “A line at a movie theater or a concert or…” He trailed off and peered over behind his shoulder.

My smile cracked, unsettled by Betto’s bizarrerie. Dead air is a negative commandment for live performers, but I couldn’t find my voice to speak.

“Or a broad may show?” he said.

“A broad may show? Is—”

“You know, on stage. Do you like Charlie Chaplin? Same mustache as the Führer, but better with slapstick.”

I thought about it for a minute. “Do you mean ‘Broadway’?”

“Yes!” He laughed. It sounded like looseleaf paper rustling together. 

He was getting comfortable. He sent me another tip, this one for twenty-five-thousand tokens. Five-thousand dollars. If we were in a champagne room at a strip club, I’d know what brand of boxers he wore.

I pulled my bikini’s cups out a little and let my nipples peek through while I licked the rim of my lips. It’s what they pay for—isn’t it what they pay for?

“DON’T,” he said. His voice turned harsh and alien. I snapped my top back into place. I felt like someone slammed the cookie jar lid on my fingertips. I didn’t appreciate a stranger trying to shame me. I didn’t even like strangers (though those were an occupational hazard).

He was quiet. We were both quiet.

It bothered me that I couldn’t tell where his eyes were, though there was a sparkling, yellowish glint where his eyes might’ve been.

“I’m sorry,” he said.

“No, no, it’s alright,” I insisted, finicking with my hair in the nervy way I do when nothing’s in its place. I touched the corners of my mouth to check my lip gloss.

“I’m sorry,” he said again. He looked behind himself quickly, the way men do when someone catches them doing anything.

“Baby, don’t worry about it.” I smiled. “I’m a big girl.”

He turned back toward me. He changed his mind and checked behind himself again. Was someone watching him?

He settled back in his seat, and then we were both quiet again. 

Thirty seconds of silence and then another notification: Seven-hundred-thirty-seven-thousand more tokens added to the day’s tally. Almost thirty-seven-thousand dollars.

I felt like my lungs were too small to give me enough air. 

I could buy that Hermès flared dress and something gold to wrap around my neck. Or maybe a pearl choker from a brand jewelry designer—something that doesn’t scream “social climber”. Something that tells people I’m indifferent to wealth, the way only wealthy people can truly be. What did WASPs wear? Boucheron, Van Cleef & Arpels, Harry Winston, what? I didn’t know enough to know what I didn’t know.

It was the biggest tip I’d ever gotten. I wasn’t just thinking about paying past due medical bills or buying toiletries from Walgreens instead of Dollar Tree. This was enough money to change my whole life.

So I did something to show I was worth the oodles. I gave him what he asked for. I told him a secret.

“I’m going to show you something that no one else has seen in a long time,” I said.

I was insecure about my right foot. Intellectually, I knew that the seams were undetectable, the silicon and skin perfectly matched, that no one could tell but me. But feelings trump facts and I’d never not worry.

I held my right foot up to the camera and pulled away the band of silicon that attached my prosthetic toe. It looked like I’d done all-the-world’s-uncles’ thumb-trick with my foot instead of my hand.

I heard his breathing stop. He leaned forward in his seat.

Betto was more comfortable with silence than most cam johns (or normies). “Cool,” he said, breaking his silence. “That’s cool.”

I smiled. Okay, so he wasn’t a total creeper.

“Who else knows?” he said. We roleplayed conspiracy. A true method actor, he whipped his head over his shoulder, again scanning for intruders my eyes couldn’t see. But still, nobody was there.

“Is there someone there with you?”

“Who else knows?” he asked me again.

“Nobody’s known since highschool.”

“It’s a secret,” he said and he shivered with excitation.

“Yeah, baby, it’s a secret.”

“What do you do when your boyfriend stays over?”

“I’m more comfortable being someone’s ‘girlfriend experience’ than being their girlfriend.” I reached back again to unstring my top. 

“Don’t do that.”

“Why don’t you want to see me?”

I was getting impatient. It’s not like I really wanted to strip naked, but it bothered me that he didn’t want to see the goods. There’s such a thing as professional pride.

“I have to go,” he said. When he spoke I saw his tongue again. It was almost dark purple. “Mother is waiting.” He leaned forward to turn off his computer, then he stopped. “Do you want to see something, too?” 

“Sure,” I said. He wouldn’t be the first to show me his dick. He wouldn’t even be the five-hundredth.

Betto pushed his face up to the camera, while his eyes remained hidden. He reached up into his mouth, and pulled out a partial denture of his canines from the top row of his teeth. The gaps glared where the two pointed teeth were supposed to be. I felt relief and sweet schadenfreude, knowing he was more deformed.

“My name is Betto,” he said again. 

“You told me, Betto.”

He held his partial falsies close to his webcam, like an offering. “This is a small part of my secret.”

“I guess we both shared secrets today then,” I said.

His smile matched his childlike glee. “I guess we did.” He leaned back as he replaced his partials to his mouth. Betto rubbed his hands on his knees again. “Will you be on tomorrow?”

“Yeah, sure, baby. Tomorrow, same time, same place?” I smirked; it was a reminder of our conspiracy.

“Yes. More secrets.”

I don’t know why I told him my real name. “I’m Clauda.”

A door creaked behind him, he whipped his head back again. “I have to go,” he whispered and I saw his screen suddenly snap shut.

Betto added me as a favorite. And he put another thirteen-thousand-five-hundred dollars in my account. 

፠

A change had come.

፠

I was buzzing by the time that day turned to night. Was there a reason?

I threw up six times, but after that I still drank more rosé than I had in five years. I drunk-texted men that sober-me didn’t even remember. I pissed my sheets.

And later, I reevaluated my private show for Betto; thought of things I didn’t think of at first.

That he’d never shown his eyes began to seem sinister. And that he kept checking behind him, and that syrupy scarlet drink…

My thoughts brimmed with an instinctual dislike for Betto that was hard to account for. It felt like the combined regret of every one night stand.

Maybe it was an evolutionary aversion. The way that even animals know to avoid inbreeding. The gut “bad” feeling that most people get and intuitive people know when to trust.

I know I resented him, at least in part. I resented that he thought my missing toe and his missing teeth somehow grouped us together. It was presumptuous. He thought he could pull his partials out of his mouth and—what, I would be grateful because he was fucked up, too?

I started thinking one word about him, over and over again:

Freak.

It was harsh, but it was also how I really felt.

I’ll admit, it also bothered me that he refused my full undress. Why buy a private show if not for the private parts? I knew I was what men wanted, and I’d known it since I was fifteen. There’s no better endorsement than the male gaze.

I didn’t log in the next day like I said I would. And I didn’t log in the day after that. My two-day break turned into a one-week leave of absence that rolled into a monthlong sabbatical. And that gave me enough time to really think about my life. I decided the juice of performing sexual acts on camera wasn’t worth the squeeze.

I used the money Betto tipbombed me as a down payment on two condos along the Emerald Coast. The year following, I’d saved enough to put down on another P-Cola property. And with three income streams and a year’s time after that, I bought another matching pair. At the half-decade mark, I refinanced the first five apartments to buy a whole nother lucky seven, and my landowner’s tally was a cool dozen.

Over eight years, I accumulated twenty-nine vacation properties. Anyone who advertised on busstop benches in the Redneck Riviera knew my name. I was a Superhost on Airbnb. And the best part was, I never had to take off my clothes.

Was life good? Yeah, it was pretty good. 

I had my insecurities. I was oversensitive in new social settings—a neurosis that dogs the nouveau riche and that old money will never know.

I had a residual inferiority complex. I chalked it up to the fact that I couldn’t apply bleach to life’s stains-already-passed. It’s hard to get unscrewed after a lifetime of getting screwed.

To wit, I still had dreams that relived the degradations of my childhood: my father before he was violated on his parole, drunk and smelling drunk, backlit by the hallway light and standing in my bedroom doorway, stroking himself until completion, crying in self-pity once he’d finished; the gym teacher who used to search me for “drugs”, never finding anything other than her fingers knuckle-deep in my body cavities; smoking crystal meth at eleven years old and prostituting under a bridge at sixteen. 

You know, those old chestnuts.

But I was wealthy now. Well, not wealthy—rich. Okay, I wasn’t rich yet, either. But I was getting there.

Sometimes at night I would think about him—about Betto. I still felt bad that I’d stood him up. I never pulled out all the stops and gave him a good show. Crazy, right? But I thought I owed him something.

But more than that, I thought about him when I reviewed my income statements, and I said to him, wherever he was out there in that big, scary world: “Betto, this all started with you, you strange duck. And you never even got to see my tits.”

፠

If there was one thing I did not expect, it was to see Betto again. Not ever.

፠

Sometimes you look back and wonder, “Well, why in the hell would I go there in the first place?”

I don’t have a good reason why I walked into a store called Serpentasia—morbid curiosity, amateur aversion therapy, a desire to see where snakeskin boots come from? Your guess is as good as mine. Either way, through that door I went.

A tinkling shopkeeper’s bell announced me as I entered the store. I looked around. There was no register. There was no front counter. 

“Hello?”

There was no answer.

The entire store was vivaria—glass enclosures, filled with snakes. As many heated tanks as a reptile house at the zoo. The enclosures went floor to ceiling on all four sides, entire walls made of glass cages. There were three rows of enclosures in the middle of the store, too, breaking the floor up into four aisles.

I could feel them crawling in their cages. I could feel it in the air without hearing a sound.

I looked down. The floor was made of snake-filled vivaria. I looked up. I couldn’t believe it. The whole ceiling, too—glass enclosures swimming with sidewinders and crawling with copperheads.

People sometimes say something “stunned” them. I’m skeptical that they can know the meaning of the word.

All around me were thousands of snakes of every shape and size, an efflorescence of species amassed in one place as in no other single place on earth.

The shopkeeper’s bell again tinkled behind me and I turned on my heels to see who was there. There was a boa just inside the shop door. Like it had walked in off the street right after me. It was six feet long and green like weathered copper or needles shed from blue spruce.

It slithered toward me. I stepped back. It got closer. I backed up further. It slithered closer again.

“Hello? Hello, is anybody here?” I tried to sound calm—were snakes spooked by others’ terror, like horses? My underabundance of courage was cause for concern.

The boa’s head dipped back toward its tail, pulled into itself as tightwound as a spring. Its teeth were from Cronenberg. “No, no, no,” I said, to myself, to anyone in the world who could help me. “No, no, no, no, no.”

It coiled, ready to strike.

“Someone! Someone, please help me! Are you in here? Please be in here…”

I tripped while retreating and stumbled backassward into one of the shop floor’s dividing rows. My elbow hit glass and broke through. 

I turned and saw a wriggling pile, hissing and turning under glittering shards. I pulled away from the broken cage, but then stopped short when I remembered the boa, who was still crawling closer and hissing now, too.

I looked between one and the other for the lesser evil. The one wavering out from the broken cage had a triangular head. A viper. The choice was made for me.

They both struck at once. I leapt out from between them just in time.

White-hot fear sucked all my wind from me. My whole body spasmed in earthquaking tremors. 

The boa and the viper circled one another. Maybe I’d be safe. Maybe they’d fight each other. While they went toe-to-toe I’d have a clear path to the door. 

No such luck. They decided that I was a mutual enemy. Both turned their heads toward me, hissing with the propulsive force of pneumatic airguns.

Once the two slitherers reached their peak volume, the others in their enclosures started hissing, too. The viper and boa closed in on me. Whole cages hissed louder as more snakes joined in. Soon, the shop spilled over with the noise of predators sibilating. It was the loudest, most terrible sound I’ve ever heard.

“Enough!” a man yelled from the other side of an aisle.

The snakes all went quiet, kids found out fooling after lights-out.

The boa and the viper slinked off and away. I dropped to my knees.

“I’m sorry, miss, but we aren’t open to the public.” I couldn’t quite make out the face of the man as he spoke, “My friends aren’t used to visitors that I haven’t brought in myself.”

“Friends?” I said.

He emerged from the aisle into view, walked by an enclosure whose basking lamp cast a shadow from behind his head and over his eyes. And that was just how I remembered him from our private show almost a decade ago. Eyes unlocated in darkness, with only the strange curve of his mouth in the light.

He’d said he lived in Florida. Of course.

“Betto?” I said.

“Yes…” His next step revealed his eyes; the irises striking, a shade of brown so light they were almost yellow. “Have we met before?”

This man had changed my life and he didn’t remember who I was.

“I used to do shows. I did a show. I did—almost did one, I guess, for you.”

“Shows?”

“You remember. You have to remember. You gave me—it was almost—”

“Ah,” he said, a single syllable dismissing his part in my legend of mogulhood that I’d built in my head. “Yes. I was different then. It was a bad time for me.”

“A bad time?”

“If I could only remember your name. It’s right on the tip of my tongue,” he said (and was that mockery inflected in his voice?).

He walked over where the light was bright. He had some kind of eczema or other skin condition.

“I—that’s—” I cleared my throat. “I’m a business owner now.”

“Are you? Fascinating.” Yes, he was mocking me.

Betto whistled. It was a queer, primal tune from before written language, when melody floated through the same air as witches’ incantations. He interspersed his tune with wheezes and clicks. While he fifed about, his disordered skin flaked and fell then floated across the floor; human tissue paper blown by the wind.

“It started with a C, didn’t it?” he said.

Something rustled behind me. I smelled cucumber and rot back there, too.

Betto smiled wider and wider until his lips looked like they might kiss his eyelids. A dark-purple mermaid tail slid out of his mouth. 

His tongue was forked. 

I covered my mouth and prayed for the first time in years; I begged The Great Whoever’s Up There to make this a bad dream from spoiled beef. 

Betto’s forked tongue flicked and knocked out his partials, revealing empty sockets where pointed eyeteeth should have been. The empty sockets filled with two fangs as thin and half as long as pencils, protracted from the absence in his gums.

“I remember now,” he said, his voice two in one, raspy and sandpaper-rough, dropped-pitch by an octave and shimmering like a church organ. “Clauda, wasn’t it?”

I was working up a scream that could’ve broken glass when a sharp sting in my neck broke off my preparation. Then the world went dark, and I fell into delirious dreaming, visions of envenomed rivers of blood.

፠

My eyes opened. The heat was stifling, humidity jungle-thick. I laid inside an empty cistern sunk into the ground, walls smooth with shotcrete like an empty pool, too deep to climb out of.

“I remembered you, you know.” I heard Betto speak in his shimmering, doubled voice.

I turned to face him. “What are you going to do with me?”

Betto smiled a very sad smile. His maxillary fangs sunk into same-sized pockets between his bottom lip and gums; you could hear a sucking sound as they slotted into place. 

He was naked.

“You were the first I talked to.” He breathed in slow and breathed back out slower—the evilest men regulated like ascetics, without recourse to drugs or booze. “I didn’t know about money, I just knew we had so much of whatever it was. And the meat market through the camera—well, of course I was pulled toward sin. You’re supposed to know, in your heart, the ways of sin. Mother says so.”

Where his penis should’ve been were two appendages hanging like membranous tube socks with barbed drupelets at the end. It looked like twin raspberry cacti. 

His legs were closer to two prehensile tails than bipedal limbs, and his feet terminated in slopped mounds in the shape of fleshtone bell peppers. Every time he moved, dry, dead skin crinkled from his body and fell away in sheets. There were piles of meat and toes in a human discard pile. He was shedding.

“What are you going to do?” I said, again, and my lip quivered. Welling tears stopped up my sinuses.

“I want you to meet Mother.”

“Your mother’s here?”

He held up his forefinger and wagged it in a metronome’s perfect side-to-side ticking, shook his head like an old man sad to see a child headed the wrong way. “No, no, no. Not my mother. The Mother. The Mother of Sin. The mother of choice, of debauchery and freedom. She’s very special, Clauda. Very special. She was the first who bore God’s punishments. And I want you to meet her…” 

His eyes rolled into colorless white, then kept going to reveal hidden irises painted iridescent bottle-green. A single black slash ran top to bottom through each iris. He was one of the serpents. This was the inmate who ran the asylum.

My mind ran wild with nightmarish possibility, the fruitless agony of unanswerable questions.

“What do you mean I was the first one they let you talk to?” I was terrified. But my terror was matched by a fear of not knowing, from when cavemen cowered in fear of lightning and whispered of its rulership over the sky. Then I got that intuitor’s gut feeling. “I was the first woman you ever talked to.”

He sneered at me but couldn’t deny.

“I’m from the original species of sinners, an inheritor of the black mark older than language. We precede both goodness and humankind’s comprehension thereof. The first unholy offenders, the ancients damned to forever crawl.”

He jumped at me. I shrieked. His arms and legs spread in a flying X, and when his body flew into mine, his limbs latched over and behind like fleshly grappling hooks.

“Please, please!” I screamed, and tried to break away. I looked into Betto’s green-glowing eyes and saw an emptiness that couldn’t be filled, and a hunger that couldn’t be fed. His legs wrapped around mine in winding coils, felt sticky with slime, the flesh underneath like extra-coarse grit sandpaper smeared with jelly. 

If I cried, I was done for. Instead I screamed. “Goddamnit, let me go!”

“You have to meet Mother.” Betto opened his overwide and oversized mouth. Black glands throbbed inside the pink walls of each cheek; viscous green-black slime drooled from puncta at the glands’ tips.

I understood if I didn’t fight I wouldn’t live. I took wild punches, missing almost every one.

But then I connected. The sound of my fist smashing into his chin wasn’t what I expected. It was fleshy and dull, but I might’ve broken my hand.

He hissed; the noise was industrial. He punched me, and his fists knew violence much better than mine. He rocked me so hard my head bounced on the concrete floor under me and came right back up.

The world dipped into slow-motion; I was a step removed from myself. I didn’t have control of my body so I could not (and did not) struggle. I looked up at Betto and saw his fangs stuck out of his mouth—drip, drip, dripped on my face. His head came down like a railroad worker’s maul sledgehammering a rail spike. His fangs sunk so deep in my neck I might have felt them in my throat.

When he’d finished envenoming my bloodstream, he let me loose and sat close by.

And then I heard a lowing rumble. A call from an epoch before the great extinctions.

“She’s here,” Betto said. He held his arms up toward the ceiling, like a penitent spotlighted in the grace of redemption.

My eyes moved toward the low growl. What I saw was the stuff of midnight creature features and forgotten Old World lore. It crawled down on its boat-length belly into the empty cistern, revealing its body a car-length at a time. It was shaped like a snake, but it was thick as a tree trunk, scales spotted in blemishes and tumors in the shapes of human faces. Its head wasn’t a snake’s head, it was girthy and covered in ridges like an alligator’s, but split right open down the middle from the tip of its nose to the beginning of its eyes. It almost looked like it had two heads side-by-side.

“Mother,” Betto whispered in malediction, “Mother, oh, Mother…”

I lost consciousness just as Mother’s head drew close to mine.

፠

I woke up in the basin, I don’t know how long after. Betto had put a ladder up against the side so I could climb out.

፠

I’ve tried to forget most of it. But I couldn’t get the image of Mother’s split head out of my mind.

I have to admit that something is happening to me. My skin dies and regrows with the seasons.

፠

As soon as I started brushing, something clicked and popped inside my mouth. I felt two pebbles on my tongue. I spit them out into the sink and saw my two top canines rattle around the basin. My teeth settled on the closed drain stopper. They were spattered with green-black ooze, like from the glands in Betto’s mouth. I wondered if my blood still ran red.

Today, I walked by a pet store and felt my stomach rumble. I went inside to look around, and stopped when I saw what I didn’t know I’d been looking for.

A vacuum-sealed bag full of “pinkies”. It said ALL NATURAL WHOLE PREY. 

But then I sensed something warm, something that lived and breathed in fear of my body’s scent. I turned around and then I found display cases filled with skittering rats.

I’d seen rats before, but never like this. I saw their warmth in thermal images, a vision of glowing light that showed how their blood warmed their bodies. And I felt hungry. I felt so, so hungry.

“Excuse me, can I help you with anything?” A woman in a nametag and polo shirt asked me while I stared.

“Yes,” I said, pointing toward the glass cage, “how much for all the rats?”
