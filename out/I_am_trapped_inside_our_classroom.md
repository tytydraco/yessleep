I am a 2nd year college student and I always go to school early maybe around 6 or 7, nothing is really unusual in this school where I went to and to be completely honest it's kinda boring here but since this is the nearest University I could get into I choose this so I won't have to travel pretty far and spend a lot of money just for the transportation. 

One day I left my house at 6am and I got to school at around 6:45am, at this time the campus is still pretty empty because our class starts at 8 so I can just take a nap in our classroom while waiting for my friends. I went straight to our classroom and I sat on the seat assigned to me by our instructor and I lean my head on the armchair before falling asleep. 

At around 7:30 I woke up and saw my classmates fooling around so I started talking to them abour random stuffs mostly about our final project due next week. We spend time till our Instructor enters the room and she started the lesson as usual, I sat quietly listening to our topic which is about GMO or Genetically modified organisms. "Good Morning ma'am I would like to inform you about our meeting in the dean's office", "Oh okay I'll be there" she replied with a smile to one of our other instructors who interrupted our class. 

Our instructor went out of our classroom and told us that we can go out to take a snack or comfort room break so I stood up after she left and as I walk out of the door I felt dizzy and then the next thing I knew is I woke up from a nap in my seat same as what happened earlier and so I checked the time and it said 7:30 so I thought maybe what happened earlier is just a dream so I look around and saw my classmates fooling around and just like what I did in my dream we talked to each other about random stuffs. 

Later on our Instructor enters the classroom and we discussed about GMO then after a few minutes she was called for a meeting in the dean's office, it's kinda odd but at the same time I was amazed on how my dream kinda predicted what would happen next. 

After our instructor left the classroom I suddenly got the feeling that I should go to the comfort room and so I stood up and as I walk out the door I felt dizzy again and the next thing I knew is I woke up at 7:30 in the same place and the same time as what happened to what I thought was a dream. What scared me the most is the fact that this thing keeps on happening repeatedly and based on my estimatation I've been doing this for 14 times and everytime I tried to do something different my head hurts so bad and I would find myself waking up from a nap same as what happened everytime I walk through the door. 

I tried to use my phone but everytime I tried to open my contacts or other apps It would just freeze and then after a while it will work again but the app would be mysteriously erased so I couldn't send a message or call anyone and when I tried to tell other people about it they just laughed at me. I am trapped in this classroom and I just want to go out, After trying so many times to tell other people about it I decided to try and slip a note to the window and for some reason it works I also tried using other applications and some of it works and I can even send a message by game chats.. So I decided to write this long story to further explain my situation right now and please.. I need your help. I can't stay here any longer. HELP ME
