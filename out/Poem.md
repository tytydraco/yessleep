Poem 17.

Once, something so beautiful,
Now crumbles, fading apart.
What once was pure and radiant,
Now lies in shadows, caught by the dark.

Once, your smile lit my skies,
Now it’s a wound, deep in my heart.
What is it that changes so much?
Is it not the same air we breathe?
The same sun that burns bright?
Or flowers that once painted the world so alive—
Why now do we see only grays?

The truth is…

The air is the same; it just no longer carries your breath.
The flowers still bloom, but we’ve lost their depth.
The sun still shines, but its warmth cannot find me,
For the fire we shared has turned cold, icy, empty.

There is no ‘we’ anymore,
Just you. Just me.


---

Once, we wove memories, soft as dreams.
Once, we saw a future so real, so bright.
Now, watching it shatter before our eyes,
The hardest part is this—
We’re the ones breaking it, piece by piece.

Once, your tears could destroy my peace,
Now they fall, and I barely feel.
Once, what mattered was your smile,
Now, all that’s left are darkened dreams.

I have no regret for what I gave,
But if I were you,
This day would have never come.


---

But now…

Distance grows, and "buts" take their place,
In spaces where once, you owned every trace.
Once, there was a story of tea and momo,
Now, only ashes of a burned forest remain.


---

Once, flowers painted our world so bright,
Now, we see only gray in the light.
Once, a bad boy turned sweet,
Once, there was someone in my heart.
Once, something so beautiful,
Now crumbles, fading apart.
What once was pure and radiant,
Now lies in shadows, caught by the dark.

Once, your smile lit my skies,
Now it’s a wound, deep in my heart.
What is it that changes so much?
Is it not the same air we breathe?
The same sun that burns bright?
Or flowers that once painted the world so alive—
Why now do we see only grays?

The truth is…

The air is the same; it just no longer carries your breath.
The flowers still bloom, but we’ve lost their depth.
The sun still shines, but its warmth cannot find me,
For the fire we shared has turned cold, icy, empty.

There is no ‘we’ anymore,
Just you. Just me.
