Part 1:

It was a cold, American midwest, October day. Walking into school felt fine other than a few wind chills on my way to the bus stop. Most of my day was mundane other than a few fun moments throughout my classes. I didn't take any honors or AP becuase its a waste of time and too much work. At the end of my day I had Drivers ED.

The first day I was driving, I was told to go straight onto the road. I had never done this before. All I knew was the safety of an empty parking lot. My teacher told me to start driving off of the school lot and onto the street. I executed my mission perfectly. I then went into a neighborhood and turned with such grace, a gazelle would be envious. 

After a couple weeks of getting better behind the wheel, I was assigned a busier route: Old Oaktown. It had a cozy look to it—like those small-town shows where everyone knows each other. During the first drive in old Oaktown, we passed by a massive complex. There was a large building and a very strange, seemingly out-of-place coliseum-style structure. I noticed several “Do Not Enter” signs on the fence, though one part was broken enough for a decently pudgy individual to squeeze through.

If I had stopped at just thinking the place was odd, life would be as simple as it once was. But in my constant quest for something to do I inquired we switched roles in the car with my partner.

“Excuse me, Mr. Johnson?” I asked timidly from the back seat.

“What’s up kid?” he responded in a thick Chicago accent.

“I was just wondering—what’s that place we passed not too long ago?”

He leaned in slightly, whispering like someone else might be listening.

“You talkin’ bout that old hospital? That place has been abandoned for years. City says they’re gonna demolish it and build a rec center. Damn time they did somethin’ with that godforsaken land.”

“Do you have something against it?”

“Everyone in town’s got something against it. I suggest you forget any ideas of going near there.”

The silence on the way back to school was deafening. In the corner of my eye I saw a thin line of white foam trailing from the corner of his mouth.

When we arrived back at school, Mr. Johnson told me to stay behind.

“You seem like the reasonable type, so I’ma tell it to ya straight.” He stepped closer, pointing a finger in my face. “Don’t you ever go by it. Don’t think about goin’ there, don’t plan on goin’ there—just stay the hell away.”

More white foam began to gather at the corner of his lips.

I nodded quickly and practically ran back into the school.

I could’ve sworn I heard him saying something under his breath. It sounded something like: 

“The spokeless sufferings never foster.”

Whatever the hell that means.

In the next period, I started hearing whispers through the halls. I caught a disgusted look on a girl’s face.

“He’s probably a fuckin’ pred,” she muttered to her friend. “I don’t know why they haven’t come back yet.”

“It’s so disturbing to think he was one of my teachers… that could’ve been me,” the friend replied.

I could practically feel the disgust and hatred oozing off my peers.

After school, I met up with Ashley at my house. She was my best friend—the one person who really knew me. Her long black hair flowed like the Milky Way at midnight, always slightly tousled like she’d just stepped out of the wind. Her eyes were sharp and expressive, a deep brown that caught the light like polished wood.

She stood around 5’5, with a slim but fit build that made her seem almost weightless when she moved—like the world barely touched her. She had this confident, sarcastic edge that kept most people at a distance, but I knew the softer side.

We’d been neighbors since we were kids, crawling through the hole in the fence between our yards to hang out. Lately, though, something about being around her made my chest feel tight. I pushed that feeling down.

We made our way up to my room. I sat on the beanbag and she took over my bed. I grabbed my phone and looked at my notifications.

“Holy shit,” I almost yelled.

“What’s up?” she asked.

“Mr. Johnson—look at the email the principal sent out…

"No fucking way,”

I read aloud:

“I regret to inform everyone that our beloved Mr. Johnson, along with student Kylie Morgan, have unfortunately passed away in a car accident today during the last drive of the day. If anyone is experiencing grief, please reach out to our school counselors…”

A police statement was linked in the email. Only one line shook me.

"The bodies were not recovered."

I trailed off. The rest of the message blurred into background noise.

I looked up at Ashley. Her eyes were already wet. I knew how much Kylie meant to her. Other than me, Kylie had been her closest friend.

“Fucking hell. I—” I choked and cleared my throat. “I’m so sorry.”

She started sobbing.

“Why…” she whispered, her voice growing louder. “Why… why… why… WHY? WHY!”

She was bawling now. I got up and handed her the tissue box, placing it by her side. I sat next to her, quietly.

I felt her head lean on my shoulder. I rubbed her arm gently and did my best to comfort her. The room was quiet aside from the occasional sniffling. Some time passed before either of us spoke.

“Let’s go grab something to eat,” I said softly.

She gave a faint nod, wiping her face with her sleeve.

“Yeah... okay.”

We headed downstairs, not saying much. The weight of the news still hung heavy in the air like wet smoke. In the kitchen, my mom was prepping dinner while my dad sat at the dining table, sorting through some bills.

“Hey Mom,” I called out, trying to sound casual.

“Yes, hon?”

“So, me and Ash were thinking of going for a walk. Is that okay with you guys?”

“Sure, where are you two going?”

That’s when I hesitated. Something in me felt the need to say it out of honesty. 

“There’s this place in Old Oaktown. Looked kind of interesting.”

I saw my dad’s shoulders tighten and his hand run through his short auburn hair.

“Mr. Johnson got aggressive when I asked about it. Told me to stay away. Then when we got back to school, he pulled me aside and told me again. He was foaming at the mouth by the end of it. I thought he was having a panic attack or something.”

My mom froze in place, fork in mid-air. I saw a vein or two pop out of my dad's forehead like a tapeworm wriggling under his skin.

“And then today,” I added quietly, “The principal sent an email that said he died. Car accident. With one of the students.”

All the noise got sucked out of the room. 

“I think it said it happened on the intersection in front of an old hospital.

Like a fuse snapped in his brain, my father slammed his face onto the table. The legs screeched against the floor. Blood splattered onto the table. He lifted his face again and revealed a broken nose. He threw his face even harder this time into the table. And again, and again, and again. He moved towards the corner of the table and dropped his eye socket into it. His eye squelched and I saw a sort of liquid start dripping down the leg of the table. He was crying his eyes out. I put my arms under his armpits to restrain him but he was multiple times stronger than usual. He still persisted in slamming his forehead into the table. His neck and shoulders elongated to compensate for me holding him back. His skin stretched to a gruesome degree. He finally lifted his head up and spoke for the last time.

“DON’T YOU EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING, YOU HEAR ME?! THE SMOKELESS OFFERINGS NEVER PROSPER!”

He gripped the sides of his head. Froth began forming at the corners of his mouth. He stood up, but his knees buckled. He dropped to the floor like a magnet and started seizing. His eyes rolled back, and I saw a glimmer of black in what should have been the white and red veins of the bottom of his only eyeball.

Mom screamed. I lunged forward to catch his head before it hit the floor. His body twitched and spasmed violently, arms rigid. White foam poured from his mouth, staining his shirt. Ashley stood frozen, her mouth covered, eyes wide with terror.

All I could hear, over and over again, was that phrase but this time instead of mindless gibberish that I thought my late teacher was saying, it was clear and loud.

The paramedics came quickly. My father was still twitching every couple seconds when they lifted him onto the stretcher. His veins in his neck were taut like cables.

Ashley sat on the couch, frozen. The floor beneath me was stained, and my heartbeat in my ears.

The EMTs worked fast but with hesitation. One, likely fresh out of training, stiffened when he met my dad’s eyes — fully black with just a pinpoint of white. His gloved hands trembled as he secured restraints around Dad’s thrashing body. 

Then, came the knock.

But it wasn’t from the front door.

The back door shook slightly. I opened it cautiously and there stood a man in the doorway

No ambulance, no flashing lights, no badge or uniform just a long gray overcoat trailing past his knees, gloves black as void, and shoes so polished they seemed to swallow the dim porch light.

He said nothing. From the side of the house, two more emerged.

They were identical — same height, same matte gray coats, and same timed footsteps.

They stepped inside, moving slowly, as if the air itself resisted him.

Inside, the nurses paused their tasks and lowered their eyes respectfully. Restricted, urgent glances exchanged. They all stepped forward, bowed slightly, then silently moved aside..

Without another sound, they wheeled Dad out.

The gray figures followed quietly, calm and composed, shadows swallowed by the night outside.

No sirens.

No engines.

Just silence.

Ashley whispered behind me, “Did you see their faces?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I didn’t.

All that was there was beige flesh draped over something moving, like a bug under saran wrap.



Part 2:



Its been a week since my dad did what he did. I inquired at the nearest hospital but the lady at the desk said some bullshit about him being in the ER and was too unstable to have anyone else be in the room with him. I waited another 2 days before going back.

“Which hospital is he in?” I asked with an aggressive hint in my voice.

“Ummm… let me check the computer.”

“Its saying hes at—”

Her eyes darted around. She got cut off by a phone ringing. She covered one part of the phone and whispered to me 

“You can take a seat in the waiting room until I can assist you.”

“Fuckin hell” I muttered under my breath as i walked towards the blue leather chairs in the waiting room.

For the next hour and a half she tended to other matters than mine. And whenever i got up to talk to her she would get another call. I had an appointment to get to with the school counselor and if i missed another one they would call my mom. She doesn’t need any more stress. I gave up on seeing my father, just hearing that he was alive was good enough for me.

“FUCKING BULLSHIT. How could a completely normal man switch to a suicidal lunatic in the blink of an eye.”

That’s what I told Ms. Davidson, her office was small, the walls plastered with calming posters and motivational quotes but none of that reached me.

She just nodded slowly, her eyes soft but serious. She couldn’t be older than 25, 

“I know it’s hard,” she said, voice steady. “You’ve been through a lot. It’s okay to feel angry, scared… confused.”

I clenched my fists, fighting the swirl of thoughts in my head.

Ms. Davidson’s face flickered for a moment — a crack in the calm facade — before she recovered.

“Coping can take many forms,” she said carefully. "But for now take it easy. Watched through the window as a leaf drifted down, twisting in the wind.

Later that day, I found Ashley waiting for me behind the school. She looked tired and and I don't think she's gotten a good nights rest in days. 

“I talked to Mrs. Davidson,” I said without preamble.

She raised an eyebrow.

“And?”

“I told her everything. About Dad. The grays. The hospital.”

Ashley’s jaw tightened and she flinched.

“She said to take it easy,” I said, voice low but steady. “But fuck that," I gained confidence with every word I spoke. 

"Every second we don't look for my dad is another second that he could be suffering. I know for a fact that he's there. We need to find out what the hell is happening.” 

“What the fuck?" She blurted out.

There goes my confidence.

"Seriously do you hear yourself? Your dad went ballistic over just hearing about that place. My best friend died because of that son-of-a-bitch teacher went crazy after just driving past it.”

That hurt to hear.

"Ashley, listen to me— my dad is in there. "Then why did those Grays take him alive, Ash? Why not just let him die? Why’d the hospital lady lie? Why were Kylie and Mr. Johnsons bodies not found? Ash, they’re hiding something. "

My voice cracked, and Ashley’s eyes were red-rimmed, her fingers digging into her sleeves like she was physically holding herself together. 

"You think I don’t know how insane this sounds? But look at me." 

I grabbed her wrists, forcing her to meet my gaze.

"My dad smashed his own face in just from a mention about that place. That’s not panic. That’s not some fucking breakdown. That’s—that’s something else. And if we don’t go, if we just sit here and pretend like none of this happened, then what would happen to other people. I have a feeling that three missing bodies is going to just be a start" 

I could practically feel her heart through the pulse in her wrists, but I still squeezed tighter. "I don't want to go. But I can’t do nothing. So please."

The silence between us was thick enough to choke on. Then, slowly, she exhaled—a shuddering, broken thing—and nodded.

"Thank you." I managed to whisper as I held her closer and remembered our childhood. I remembered what was now robbed from us. We both sobbed quietly on each others shoulders.

We both calmed down after a solid 20 minutes or so. 

"Let me say goodbye to my mom first. I want to leave on a good note. Just in case."

I saw her dark brown eyes start to glisten once more with what I thought was going to be an ocean of tears, but she held them back with a dam of determination. 

"Don't... don't talk like that." She somberly remarked. 

I stared at the ground  in shame and took one last slow look at her before I left for my house.

"Tommorrow we will meet by the KMart on the intersection that Kylie--" I fumbled around with my words, carefully avoiding the words that would break the dam.

"Yeah by that one."

I'll see you tommorrow at 3?" I questioned.	

"Yeah," She finally said after a short pause.

I rode my bike home and knocked on the front door. My mom answered and gave me a hug as I walked in. I sat down as my mom brought me some tea. We talked for a while about how we felt and how my day was going. I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye. After a while I went back to my room and wrote a note. Some more tears dripped onto the paper as I wrote it. 

The night was long and I woke up a few times, but I was ready. I packed a backpack with essentials and left the house on a bike and got to the k-mart at 3:15. Ashley was waiting impatiently on the side of the building. 

"Took you long enough."

"I had to pack my bag," I said while unzipping it to show a flashlight, a knife, and some other snacks. I also very dramatically took out a drone and showed it to her.

"Very good idea, but have you flown one before?" she questioned. 

"Once, but I think I can get the gist of it down pretty quickly," I said.

The building loomed over us like a rotten tooth jutting from the earth. Seven stories of cracked concrete and grime-streaked windows, some shattered into jagged spiderwebs, others still intact but fogged with decades of dust. The glass reflected the overcast sky in warped fragments, making it seem like the windows were watching us.

At the base, the double doors hung crooked on their hinges, one barely clinging by a single rusted bolt. A faded sign above read "OAKVIEW GENERAL" in peeling paint. The brick facade was choked with ivy, the vines unnaturally thick, pulsing slightly in the wind like veins.

We stepped closer, and the air grew heavier, thick with the scent of mildew and something metallic. Near the entrance, a wheelchair lay on its side.

Ashley pointed to the ground. "Look."

Beneath our feet, the pavement was stained—not with dirt or oil, but with hundreds of overlapping shoe prints, all leading into the hospital, none coming back out. Some were fresh.

Above us, a flickering light danced behind a fourth-floor window. Then vanished.

“Sending the drone in,” I said in a whisper. 

It whirred to life as I looked through the goggles that put my eyes in the drone. I checked the first floor and saw nothing other than used needles, empty medicine bottles, and broken beer bottles. The door to the stairs was open and the drone flew through. I nicked the doorway to the second floor and almost let out a yelp but I swallowed it down. The second floor and third floor were basically the same. Nothing notable but unnerving nonetheless. I went up the last set of stairs when the drone suddenly got snatched out of the air. It did a 90 degree turn at a nauseating speed. Whoever held it threw it down to the ground. The man had short auburn hair. 

There was my dad, sitting in a surgery chair with his chest flapped open. And one of the men in the overcoats leaning over him. 

“Ash?” 

My lip trembled.

“My fucking dad, he… he’s there. But the grays are doing something to him. We have to go now though, we can’t wait. If we do it might be too—”

I stopped talking as I took off my drone goggles and turned towards Ashley. 

She wasn’t there. All that was, was black foam on the ground, and footprints leading all the way over to the coliseum structure in the distance. I peered through the goggles at my dad and gray man slowly took it off. The coat stuck to it but the thing ripped it off like it was pulling a hangnailI. Black chunky bits fell as it ripped off even more of the coat. Slowly and slowly it revealed a body of bones that were all too long for its reversed, slimy skin. Its torso was elongated and its arms bent the wrong way at the elbow. It finally tore off its flesh mask and revealed a spinal cord that broke through the skin and went all the way to where the top of its head should be and then curved. It held a ball of smokeless fire from the tip. The fire produced no light. The only thing illuminating the room was a small, flickering light above the chair my dad sat in. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder.

I turned slowly, clutching the goggles in hand and saw a tall figure standing over me. The same Gray that was at my house a week ago. I froze and it started to peel off  its skin like the other one above my dad. Then it plunged its burning skull downward, the fire searing my tongue, filling my throat with the taste of charred meat and molten copper. I heard something guttural and wet, growling.

“You have to choose.” 

It moved its hands under our heads and held two fleshy blobs that could organs. One was dark and shriveled, but still twitched slightly. The other was still dripping the black foam out into the things hands. It was pink and had seemed to have more life in it.

“Whos soul should be devoured.” 

It squeezed the black one. My dad shrieked from the fourth floor. 

“The longer you wait, the more of themselves they will lose.”

It squeezed the other and a high pitched scream rang out from the coliseum. 

“PLEASE.” I begged the thing.

My mind paced back and forth for what felt like centuries.

“Ash. Save her.”

“As you wish.”

The fingers dug into my cheeks, peeling my jaw open wider than it should go. I felt the pop of tendons, the creak of bone as my mouth stretched into an unhinged oval. Its spindly fingers scraped along the roof and bottom of my mouth, peeling back flesh in wet ribbons, exposing raw nerve endings that screamed with every brush of air.

My father’s soul—blackened and twitching—was shoved inside my mouth, the gelatinous mass writhing against my uvula as I gagged.

It was alive.

I could feel it squirming, pulsing, and digging into the soft tissue of my esophagus as I was forced to swallow. My throat bulged obscenely, the shape of it pressing against my skin as it slid down—my fathers soul, kicking, clawing its way into my stomach.

My body rejected it immediately.

My stomach lurched, contorting as the soul thrashed inside me, my skin stretching, rippling with unnatural movement. Black veins spidered outward from my abdomen, spreading up my chest, my neck, burning like acid beneath my flesh. I vomited, but what came up wasn’t bile—it was thick, black tendrils, wriggling like worms on the ground before dissolving into more black foam.

The Gray dropped Ashley’s soul into my hands.

It was still warm, still pulsing, but the edges were already blackening, curling like paper in a flame. The membrane quivered, straining to hold itself together as fractures erupted like broken glass across its surface. 

I looked up through the goggles just in time to see my father’s body unraveling on the fourth floor.His skin slithered off his bones in greasy strips, his muscles liquefying, pouring out of him in thick, syrupy strands that twitched as they hit the ground. His jaw unhinged, his scream bubbling into silence as his eyeballs burst, dripping down his cheeks like an overripe grape

And then—nothing.

Just an empty husk, collapsing in on itself like a deflated balloon.

The creature was gone. As swiftly and quietly as it arrived.

Ashley’s soul wept in my hands, the last of its light flickering out.

And inside me—

Something stirred.

Something that wasn’t mine.

I didn’t hesitate.

Ashley’s soul pulsed in my hands, slick and warm. The coliseum loomed ahead—less than a hundred feet across the overgrown field. Just dead grass crunching underfoot and the cold October wind biting my face.

I ran.

My lungs burned. My legs ached. The weight of what I’d just done—what I’d chosen—threatened to buckle my knees, but I couldn’t stop. Not now.

The field was eerily still. No birds. No insects. Just the sound of my own ragged breathing and the distant creak of the coliseum’s rusted gates swaying in the wind. My shoes slipped on wet leaves, but I caught myself, sprinting harder.

The coliseum doors hung open, darkness pooling inside. I skidded to a stop at the threshold, my chest heaving. The air smelled like damp concrete and rot.

And there—

Ashley.

She lay on the stone floor, her body too still, her skin already taking on a waxy pallor. The front of her shirt was torn open, the skin beneath unbroken like my father. I dropped to my knees beside her, my hands shaking as I pressed her soul to her chest.

“Please, please, please,” I whispered hopefully.

For a second—nothing.

Then her back arched off the ground, her mouth stretching open in a silent scream—

Ashley's body jerked beneath my hands like a marionette with its strings cut. Her back arched violently, spine bowing until I heard the wet crack of vertebrae protesting. The soul pulsed against her sternum, its edges blackening as it struggled to take root.

Her skin rippled.

At first it was subtle—a twitch beneath her collarbone, a shudder along her ribs. Then her flesh began peeling back in jagged seams, not bleeding but unspooling, revealing glistening muscle beneath. The soul squirmed deeper, burning its way through her like acid through paper.

Her eyes flew open—

—and kept opening.

Lids stretched until they tore at against her eyebrows, the whites flooding black as her pupils dilated into voids. Her jaw unhinged with a sickening pop, her scream finally breaking free—

—except it wasn't her voice.

It was mine.

My own scream from when I'd watched my father break himself against the table, perfectly replicated in her ruined throat. Then Mr. Johnson's choked gasps. Then Kylie's final sob. A cacophony of stolen agony pouring from her lips.

Her fingers clamped around my wrist, nails splitting as they dug into my flesh. The bones beneath her skin writhed like snakes, her forearm snapping in two places as it twisted unnaturally.

Her body convulsed, rejecting the corrupted essence as I heard the men in the overcoats all laughing around me. A cacophonous and gut wrenching vibration in the air. Black foam gushed from her nose and mouth, hardening rapidly into jagged obsidian shards that sliced her lips to ribbons. Her stomach distended grotesquely before rupturing inward, collapsing like a deflating balloon as she stabilized

One final, shuddering gasp—

—then stillness.

Her hand fell away.

The laughter faded behind me as I stumbled out of the coliseum, my legs moving on their own. The wind had died. The field was silent. Even the rusted gates didn’t creak as I passed through them.

Ashley was gone.

My father was gone.

And inside me, his soul, lay still, a dead weight beneath my ribs.

I walked.

Past the hospital, its windows dark. Past the broken fence, the torn metal flap swaying slightly in a breeze I couldn’t feel. My shoes scuffed against the pavement, the sound too loud in the empty air.

I didn’t cry.

I didn’t scream.

I just walked, one foot in front of the other, until the streetlights of my neighborhood flickered into view.

My house was dark.

I opened the front door—unlocked, like always—and stepped inside. The kitchen smelled like the tea my mom had made me earlier. The chair my dad had shattered his face against was gone, the floor scrubbed clean.

I sat on the edge of my bed.

Outside, the wind picked up again, rattling the branches of the oak tree Ashley and I had climbed as kids.

I waited.

For the tears. For the breakdown. For something that would make this feel real.

But nothing came.

Just the weight.

And the cold steel of my father's gun as I cocked it and pressed the barrel to the roof of my mouth—right where his soul had forced its way in just hours before.
