Even before turning off the interstate exit into town, I could see the Sacrafi Manor’s imposing breath casting shade over everything below. The entire property was surrounded by a brown sea of withered trees that used to be a forest. Everyone just understood it as “the thicket” now. Eventually, it fades back to life, into the lush green waves and tranquil trails of natural woodland. Only, the emerald wash sits far off against the horizon, like a hazy green sun setting over the mountains in the distance. From the highway, I can’t see any obvious roads into the mansion, almost like you had to submit yourself to be swallowed up into its maw. Once inside, the residents of Roanoke say everything is gray, no color can reach the floor through the thick, leafless, branches of pine above. Dry needles that could light at the slightest spark crunch under your boots while wandering through. Everything inside whistles at the slightest wind, seemingly gaining as you wander. It’s an eerie feeling, walking through a forest where there’s such little life that even decay ceases to take place. 

The town itself rests at the bottom of a valley nestled in between three mountains: Marlin Mountain, The Burning Bluff, and Sacrifi’s Peak. It’s a wild thought that a family less than 50 years ago was still alive to own an entire mountain; it makes sense that Sacrifi’s held command over the entire village below too. The thicket surrounds Roanoke, spreading out from the mansion looking like an army of spiders lying in wait, ready to descend on the town. The town itself isn’t very large, the exit I’d turned off overlooked it from a cliff, winding back down closer to sea level. It’s still hundreds of feet above but compared to the surrounding terrain it might as well have been drowning. Physically, the town looked like it had been too. Buildings were slowly being overtaken by natural disasters and graffiti. It was lifeless, crumbling like everything else around. 

I couldn’t even begin to understand what had changed since the first time I saw it from that bluff. I remember visiting when I was 14, my parents taking me on vacation to stay in a cabin on the far side of Stonewall Lake. They warned me to avoid talking to the locals because they said they were odd people. Even back then, everybody had stories about how the residents had grown quiet. Hushed legends about our friends whom have turned secretive over the last few years. My parents explained their choice to visit the town as just being the cheapest option. But, back then, staring over the same edge, Roanoke looked like a normal small town. I could see the small-town square with cars parked up and down it’s slanted streets, a massive cathedral with a graveyard connected through the back, countless homes scattered out from the center, and farmland that takes up all the land on the outskirts of town before the encroaching thicket that’d been there, even back then.

I left for Roanoke to find out why people from our town were experiencing memory loss while visiting relatives or traveling for work for extended periods of time. Whispers from friends and coworkers, about the bits and pieces they remember.  Speaking to residents within Roanoke, many have similar urban legends, which tends to happen as they get passed on. What struck me was both the similarities and diversity of their stories. Small, mostly insignificant, details matched across countless first-person accounts. All of the residents mention the Sacrifi Manor, none know what’s inside. There are mentions of people who may know, but no one outside the town itself knows anything more than I can see now. 

Brad Yadir says, “His mansion was reduced to no more than stacked rubble, the entrance appearing like a deep cavern (I can see the crumbling brick as I drive by). The halls bleed stagnation through the labyrinth within. Each step creaks with abandon, like it can feel you stepping on splintered hardwood that echoes how you don’t belong. The crumbling walls hardly contain the decay within; neighbors from miles away tell how either the wind (or even the house itself) blew death down the mountain, onto the valley below.” 

His sister, Gene Yadir, said, “From no matter where you enter the property, you can see eyes watching you from the darkness, but you can never find the source because they run before you reach them. Crunching leaves from long dead trees in April, trees that ought to have rotted when they died a decade ago, should give away that you're meant to leave well enough alone.” 

The first person I wanted to talk to was a man named David Aguado. David was a sixty-four year old rancher with several different kinds of livestock. To say one thing, he was a dedicated man. After emigrating to the U.S., he quickly found a rich, more importantly ‘loving’, wife who helped him buy land from an ailing farmer forty years ago. Since then, he’s been tending to his animals with his wife and son. He had three children, but two of them had moved away once they were old enough.

His niece, Elena Aguado, contacted me about four months ago. She said she’d just returned home from visiting her uncle’s farm on the outskirts of town for a family reunion over the summer. She told me how everything felt normal when she was with them. The family sat and talked for hours during the day, but she told me how there was nothing else. She couldn’t remember eating, nor sleeping, nor even entering or leaving the town, nothing. She couldn’t even remember what they talked about, just the vague notion that they did, in fact, talk and a clear picture in her mind of the living room where they all sat. She said there were leather couches surrounding a central brick fireplace. She had a huge family, so most of her younger cousins would sit on the floor around them while everyone else was on the couches. There was something set on the floor in the middle of the circle they all formed, but she couldn’t remember what it was. She described it like her memories were hidden beyond this wall that she would never have the energy to climb.

When I was pulling up his driveway, David stepped out of his front door, shotgun in hand. After I clarified who I was and why I was there, he dropped his gun to his hip. I asked him if it was okay for me to record our conversation, he told me it was fine. He began showing me through his front door before going into what happened during the summer while his family was visiting. As he talked, I was led through his hallway, towards the kitchen. The hallway itself was dark, it was the center of the house, so it made sense. There were no lights on the walls, I couldn’t even begin to imagine how dark it was at night. Weirdly enough, I didn’t see any pictures hung anywhere either. 

Three of his sheep had regrown black wool. He’d never seen anything like it, and neither had the other towns folk. One of his “uppity-bribón learn’ed sobrino\[‘s\]” suggested that it was just some sort of genetic variation. David said he smacked him on the back of the head and said, “et ain’t science, es stupido!”, making a motion like he was slapping some invisible head. 

As we passed through the empty, barren, and peeling corridor, I noticed that it contained nothing other than a few hooks drilled hap-hazardly into the wall for things like a broom, a dustpan, and the gun that he didn’t hang back up as we walked past. Only the rotting baseboards and the faded blue and yellow flowery wallpaper gave you anything of substance to look at. All the painted horizontal lines pointed down towards the end where there was another exit from the house; a dutch door adorned with a taxidermied sheep’s head hanging on the bottom half.  It was put up on a trophy mount; I could see the stitching from here. The eyes didn’t look glass, instead as if living and wanting to know what I was doing there. David continued, telling me how one of them that’d regrown black, was his wife Betty’s favorite. They’d named it “Baby” and had taken care of it the same way they’d named it since it was born. He pointed at the head, and I was finally able to read the plaque on the bottom.

We passed by the entry of the living room on the way to the dining room. Everything looked how Elena had described it, the leather couches were splitting where the sun shone through a few windows on the three outside walls of the room. The fireplace was set in the middle, against the far wall from where I was. In the center of everything was a sigil with a single lit candle in the center of it. I stared in, trying to place everything she’d told me. The couches easily could have sat fifteen people. There were two armchairs next to each other that faced in from the sides. There were side tables, but they were pushed haphazardly into a corner of the room. Only one was accessible to open, the others were facing in odd directions. The room was huge, but everything was situated around the hearth so people would have had room to stand around and in between the couches. The entire town easily could have fit within that one room. David guided me past, to the entry of the dining room on the left near the end of the hall.

He sat me down at his table and continued to tell me how each night since their arcane regrowth, the trio would watch on, night by night, as another sheep disappeared. They waited on from the edge of the pasture beyond as, one by one, their siblings would show up mutilated on his porch. Deep into their slitted eyes was a curiosity towards what David and his family were going to do in response. Each day David’s eyes locked with the trio’s and each day a new corpse. 

My eyes wandered around the room as he talked, noticing a similar lack of decor to the rest of his home. There was a different wallpaper in this room, a classic red and black damask pattern covered everything. There was a chandelier above with eight unlit candles set in the rusted cast iron. The oak table I was sitting at was well worn, but clearly had a longer lifespan than anything else in the house. The chairs looked the same, though the fabric seating was starting to fray and wasn’t the most comfortable. They both looked handmade, like everything had good craftsmanship, but was still a little unsteady without machine precision.

David sat me down at the table and offered to grab me a drink. I turned him down and told me how while everything was happening, even night itself seemed darker; how all the stars vanished from the sky for a time. You could leave the property and see them, but something within the boundaries was staving off the twinkling lights. He said they would all stay up until the moon disappeared again behind Sacrafi’s Peak. The moment they turned their eyes from the stoop though, another corpse would be discarded. Each night was worse than the last. By the end, he said:

“They’d’un strung m’wife’s billy-goat ‘Baby’ de los tripas. Nasties’ thing I’ll see. ‘Ung from that rafter, righ’there. Destripadas y left ‘er innards ‘angin’ in’a mess abajo de ella. Como ella lo había been split despué’ bein’ hung. Tell me: how’s’at ‘appen? How’d ya’ think they got ‘er guts out antes de destriparla?”



David said it took 2 weeks' worth of killings before he’d had enough. He said that after seeing the final corpse of one of his favorite sheep, on June 22nd he decided to go out with the shotgun and kill the other two. He said they just kept staring up at him. Didn’t blink, just looked up at him. After he’d put the first one down, the second one didn’t move. The rest of the flock scattered at the noise, but that one didn’t even flinch, it just kept staring up at him. The body of the first and the last two were left just beyond the gates of the mansion. 

He said at first, they weren’t going to carry Baby’s body up, but the deaths stopped, only after carrying her up to the rest. Now, the wind no longer blows down into his pastures. He says it’s quiet now, though in the end, most stars returned. The brightest stars were gone and still hadn’t returned. 

I had a few questions after his story. First, I wanted to know why he’d mounted Baby’s head. He told me that he had no idea what else to do, it felt more fitting than anything else. Then I asked about the symbol on the floor in the living room. David acted like he had no idea what I was talking about, appearing concerned at the mention. He asked me to show him what I meant so I got up and guided him back to the living room. It was gone though, replaced by the scent of sulfur in the air. The furniture had been rearranged though. Now, instead of everything being centered around the middle of the room, two armchairs had been moved in front of the fireplace, facing it, directly on top of where the symbol had been. The couches had been moved to form a much tighter square around the armchairs. The side tables had been moved in between everything, so you would have had to walk all the way around the train of seats just to have one to use. 

The layout made sense now. I could even see the last book that either David or his wife had been reading, set at the foot of both chairs. I informed him that this wasn’t how everything had been arranged just minutes before and he just laughed at me. There was no one else in the house right now, his wife and son were in the fields tending to things. So, either they’d come in really quietly, or there were ghosts messing with me. I didn’t think it could have been ghosts, but why not given everything he’s told me. Somehow, he didn’t seem to understand how everything he’d gone through was supernatural. He just understood it as “some things just happen. Sometimes, you move on.”
