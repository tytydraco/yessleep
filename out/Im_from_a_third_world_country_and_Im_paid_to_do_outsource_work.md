My city has a heartbeat; the constant buzzing of a dense population at every crevice. Though nine-to-five jobs were an obvious choice to make ends meet, a better-paying option starts when the sun is soon to sink. Night comes for us, and morning comes to the West. And as they wake, so do independent contractors like me, paid to do their outsourced work. They get cheap labor, and I eat three meals instead of two—a harmonious symbiotic relationship.

The ringing of a phone call startled me awake that night. I squinted at my digital clock perched on the table at the foot of my bed. It bleared a neon green color, swallowed by the darkness of my room. I wore my glasses, glancing at the caller ID before answering.

*“Kid,”* my middleman, Ricky rasped through the other end of the line, *“new bounty tonight. Up for it?”*

“Mhm,” I hummed back, “It depends. Human or animal?”

Some of these outsourced work were more, *rustic*, per se.

“*Nah*,” I could almost hear the amusement in his voice, “*just a girl*.”

Just a girl. I had to laugh. Unlike animals with a dose of under-the-table anesthesia, human bounties need deliberate planning as they’re more conscious of the sleight of hand.

Don’t get me wrong though, I have my own rules. Never kill and don’t hurt anything or anyone if I can. Make it quick and as painless as possible.

I’m not particularly sacrilegious. The opposite of it, really, though I won’t admit it out loud. My family believes in nature spirits. That there’s life in all things our hands could touch, that we stand on borrowed land, and that this earth will never be ours, to begin with. Had they known I was in this line of work, I wouldn’t have anyone to return to.

But my parents grew up in the provincial parts of the country, where mounds of anthills, and banana trees occupy most plots of soil. These folklores and superstitions draped over untouched nature like a thinly spun veil; the birth of them unknown, and how they came to be was lost after centuries of pillaging. As they moved away from their hometowns, so did these stories erode at the back of their tongues. Superstitions we never practiced in the capital—can’t be practiced in a city filled with galvanized roofs and barely layered asphalt streets.

I still find myself following them, even when I’ve only known the urban cities all my life. A polite ‘excuse me’ to the wind. A small ‘sorry’ when I accidentally break a plant’s foliage.

Silly, I know. But pleasantries to the unseen have never failed me before.

Or perhaps it’s my way of restitution for all these things I do. I’m not quite sure. I mean, I don’t intend on hurting anyone, after all. The bounties I accept seem unharmful enough. Just collecting samples.

* *Saliva swab - \[redacted\]. Works at \[redacted\] village.*
* *Nail clippings - \[redacted\]. Frequents the bar at \[address redacted\]*
* *Horn - Goat with three brown spots below the right ear. Farm address: \[redacted\]*
* *Tooth - Black dog in the \[redacted\] avenue. \[Picture attached\]*

I never questioned what they used it for, or why samples were of specific sources. Or if they even survived the days of travel across oceans. I follow the instructions to get paid. That was the end of my concern.

1. *Take a photo of the source. Do NOT develop.* *Inform us if you don’t have a film camera and we’ll send one to you.*
2. *Collect bounty.*
3. *Ship the film and bounty at the following address: \[redacted\]*
4. *Bounty Poster will send your payment.*

Though human targets were harder to maneuver, I still accepted the bounty Ricky gave me. It was easy, far easier than what’s usually asked.

* *Three Hair Strands - \[Picture attached\]. Sits in Corner Street \[redacted\] every 2AM.*

The picture attached was of a woman, maybe in her early or mid-twenties. Long black hair curtained her face, a slight curve of her nose peeking from the tresses, and her eyes… Her eyes burned red, reflecting the flare of the camera’s flash. And despite the photo being taken on a filthy sidewalk, her bare feet pressing on the cobblestone path, her dress looked untouched, pristine, and white.

It was easy to find her. Knowing she’d wear the same clothes from the photo. It was always how it was. Like I said, I never questioned it. Perhaps they took reference photos on the same night. It made the job less complicated and made earning that much easier.

She sat in an alleyway, away from the noise of drunk yammering at the other street turn. Her white dress is just as clean as the one from the photo, reflecting the auburn streetlights that hit her form. Only her lips moved, seemingly whispering to herself. Her eyes blankly stared at the space of air in front of her.

This was supposed to be easy. I felt for the small scissors in my pocket, my feet already moving towards her back before I could think. I was a few meters away from her when I soundlessly mouthed my ritualistic *‘excuse me’* to the wind, and just as I took my next step forward, her head snapped to where I was.

A couple of feet away. She couldn’t have heard me.

“Hello,” her voice echoed through the space between us, standing up slowly from where she sat. It was clear, and eerily soft, like she beckoned me to step closer to her. I never had a target acknowledge me before. I didn’t know what to do in this scenario, so I pretended to be a passerby, pretending to look lost in an unfamiliar street sign above her. I bowed slightly as a form of respect or another way of saying I was just passing by.

As quick as my feet could bring me to the other side of the street, nearly moving past her, I felt a small hand come up my chest.

“Careful.” She said, eyes staring back at me. I didn’t understand. I could still remember every inch of cold seeping from the cloth above my chest that night. Though she said just a word, it felt like a vice grip, holding me in place. Her eyes... There’s something about her eyes that seemed unnatural to me. I didn’t understand then, and I couldn’t understand still how I managed to walk past her.

As I snapped myself out of my dazed state, a street turn out of her sight, my shaking fingers managed to fish a fistful of stray hairs cut jaggedly by the scissors I lost along my frantic walk.

Good. *Good*. This is more than enough for the bounty.

I grabbed for the film camera in my pocket but found the deep swell of it empty. *Fucking hell*. It must have fallen out. All they needed was a photo, right? I’m already here, and I already got more than enough bounty for the deal. I can’t possibly give this up now.

So I fished for my phone instead, trying to zoom from meters away, praying they’d accept a photo attachment. My hands were never the most stable, and it felt like the screen only captured frantic darting around foliage and lights. When finally, finally, my lens became steady enough to pause on her frame.

I unconsciously whispered a *‘sorry,’* like I was meant to apologize for what I was doing—like I was committing a sin. And just like before, her head turned. Not in a quick snapping motion like earlier, but in an erratic staggering, like cracking a bone at every curvature.

It was the first time I noticed her lips through the screen. They were dark red, so red it looked like berries burst down her teeth where they caught the swell of them. Her eyes glowed unnaturally below the orange streetlights—and they caught the lens of my phone with unthinking precision.

*Red. Red. Red.* It was all I could think of.

There was a sharp pain on the sides of my head, like a nerve being pinched from a wrong-angled twist. A girdle of ache wrapped around the flesh of my chest, and I tried my best not to rub at it.

I stopped my camera. That was enough. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

I looked back to where she was, glasses fogging from my breathing.

There was no one there.

The wind picked up around me, leaves rustled, and the nightlife noise disappeared into the whistling of it.

What was it they said? How you should be afraid when you can’t see a mountain lion? It’s because they’re hunting you. That’s how it felt now. There was a buzzing inside my head, my shoulders shuddered at the sudden shift; a ringing, stinging, line of high-pitched frequency only I could hear.

Someone—*something* was behind me.

The way its strides struck the ground doesn’t sound *earthly*.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I took another street turn, away from that place, clutching my phone and the last bits of hair that weren’t carried away by the wind.

*Anonymous1023: Hey, I sent you half the payment through \*\*\* :) I’ll pay in full after you ship the film. No pressure though.*  
*Anonymous1023: Would love to work with you again!*

*Ricky: Kid, new bounty. Want in?*

*Sam: Oi!! Where have you been? The new list sounds like something you’d accept. Check the boards when you can.*

*Anonymous1023: Hey, did you happen to take a photo? Just wanted to confirm.*

I left them on read. 

At once, when I got home that night, I immediately shipped the bounty to the receiving address. The video I managed to take was corrupted. Phone photos are a blur of black, and orange rays, and darting red lights. I barely touched my phone since.

Sometimes my fingers sift between my curtains, feeling a presence watching me, the ringing inside my head all too familiar now. I let the feeling settle, refusing to step out in the night.

*Anonymous1023: Hey did she talk to you?*

I still think of her from time to time.

My supplies had dwindled from three meals to one in the last couple of weeks. Soon I won’t have anything to spare so I can eat. Sometimes I find my fingers itching to check the bounty board again, but a sudden bursting migraine would remind me of what I’ve just experienced like a fucking Pavlovian response.

So I’m here, writing, erasing, just wanting to let all of these words be put down somewhere. Needing someone to know what I’m going through without all the judgment and weird stares.

I sleep at night now. Or at least, I try to.

I find myself in a never-ending routine. I turn my body, wishing sleep could finally come to me.

My phone pinged a message. One I still chose to ignore. I took off my glasses and looked at the foot of my bed, where the bright red blurs of my digital clock blinked in the night. The pain in my chest hadn’t dissipated since.
