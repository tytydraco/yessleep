**September 1919, Morning**  
**Barahpur village, Punjab, British India**



*The sun shone like it was the last sunrise. I was at the top of the world. Serene. With my beloved.. I held her. My lips covered her mouth. The sky went crimson.*

Then I woke up.



‘Murtad!’

‘Blasphemer!’

‘Gadhaar!’



It has been going on for a week now. The name-calling. Truth be told, I am used to it by now. What woke me up now was not the incessant barrage of slurs heading my way, but some vandal’s projectile through the window. The pane was already broken in yesterday’s stoning. This time it smashed into a water pot loudly. That was what woke me up.

There was a loud cheer outside. The satisfaction of the stone having found a mark. A sign of some damage being done. In a way it was good. This way the mob found catharsis before they decided on lynching me. And they *will* lynch me one of these days. They have their reasons. 

*Murtad!* Apostate. That is a fair accusation. When the village qazi told me that my wife and son died because of my behaviour towards my fellow moslems, I shoved him into a drain. I had fought in the Mesopotamian campaign of the Great War against the Turks, and in Afghanistan against the Lashkars. He said I had picked the wrong side.

*Gadhaar!* Traitor. That is one that I do not accept. While I was a Subedar Major in the Army in service of the British Empire, I never had to fight my own countrymen. Earlier this year in April, the Amritsar massacre had happened. General Dyer had ordered his men to fire at hundreds of men, women and children. That made every Indian I know fiercely hateful of the general. A bastard let out a rumour that I fought under General Dyer in Afghanistan. It didn't matter to the people that we weren’t even in the same division. In village news, I was the general’s right-hand man.

*Cursed!* That unfortunately is true, and probably the only thing keeping me alive. My family is cursed. My father was cursed in his youth by a *chudail* he killed. That all his bloodline will cease to exist in a generation. This is just one of the six stories going around in the village, and also one of the most plausible ones. My mother had six miscarriages before having me and my sister. My sister was fifteen when she died during childbirth. My mother dropped dead in her kitchen one day. My father, a man whom I believed to have an iron will and a lion’s heart, walked into the sun-set one day and was never seen again. The flu took my wife and son while I was on the frontier. I am the last of the bloodline, and anyone associated with me dies. That is the general consensus in the village.



‘Happy now, right? Now leave. Let him be.’ 

Qasim’s rough voice chided the crowd. He was the village barber. People were used to listening to him. The mob started to break up, the murmurs ranging from a jolly sense of achievement to curses over the spoilsport. 

‘Wake-up, you..’

Qasim kicked open the door. He took a long look at me and sighed. ‘I was half-hoping that you would have left this place by now.’

I didn’t say anything. I’m used to his loud sighs. It was his way of showing disappointment.

‘One of these days, it won’t stop at a smashed clay pot,’ he sighed again.

‘Let it burn. Let it all burn.’ My voice gurgled with suppressed rage and grief, as I spoke. ‘I don’t care, Qasim. What is there left for me in this wretched place?’



Qasim pulled the teapoy close to my sprawled self on the mat.

‘If nothing is left, why do you have to stay here? You know the mullah will not stop at this. He wants your blood and he will have it. Every friday sermon he mentions you - enemy of the *qaum* and *millat*. None of the shopkeepers will sell you anything, and your neighbours’ cows are feeding on your crops.

‘Even if the mullah quietens done, do you think your wretched brother-in-law will be silent? He is the one who spreads these rumours. Allah alone knows why people listen to him.’

I nodded. Whatever Qasim said was the truth. While I had lost interest in confronting the qazi and the mob he brought, I was sure I would drive a dagger through my wicked brother-in-law’s heart if I ever set my eyes upon him.



‘I swear it’s the end times. War and disease upon us. Men turning on men for a bigha of land and a bottle of arrack. Leave this land and go somewhere else. I will ask your brother-in-law to buy your land. He won’t allow other buyers to approach you. Take whatever pittance you get, and abandon this foul village. It is not you who are cursed, it’s our village.’

Qasim took a broom and swept off the clay shards.

I got up, washed my face from another clay pot.

‘I am not going, Qasim. Not until I stab that bastard through the eye. Then the whole village can tear me apart and set me upon fire.’

‘I hope they won’t. There are always a few people who don’t believe in the curse story. I don’t know if that is good or bad.’ Qasim tried to fix the window pane. It was a lost cause.

‘Like you.’ I snickered.

‘Yes, I am more of a man of practical means. Chudails and curses do not scare me. Monsters do not exist.’ He searched the kitchen for tea. ‘You’re out of sugar.’

‘Monsters do exist. They are *men!*’ I spat. There was no spittle. My throat was as parched as my land.

‘Talking about monsters, there is a man whom you might want to see. He’s from Kumaon. Some village closer to the Nepal border. They need a hunter.’

‘That is in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and they are probably looking for tiger-hunters. I hunted wolves in Behar ten years ago. They are different things. Besides, why is he searching for hunters so far?’

‘He’s a travelling apothecary. The village can’t afford a hunter. The whole province is overridden with man-eaters. Why don’t you go there? Help some folks out, and then this change of atmosphere will help you as well. Come back when it’s all cooled down. Or..’

‘Or?’

‘Don’t come back at all. Find a good girl. You’re young. Find a place where they don’t remind you of curses and deaths.’

I didn’t say anything.

He placed the tea-cup beside me, and walked towards the door. 

‘I have asked him to come here at noon. See if you can convince yourself. You deserve a good life.’ Qasim left.

*They did too*. Hot tears ran down my cheeks and sank into my beard.



\* \* \*

I donned my last set of fresh clothes. The washerwoman has not turned up. She wouldn’t. Hindoo or Moslem, no one would go against the qazi. 

As I approached the well to get a pot of water, women gathered their water pots and moved away hurriedly. Children squinted and stared while I filled the pots.

I hung the washing on the clothesline. It might not take all the stains out but certainly would help with the smell. I needed to visit my family. Then find a shop that would sell me some sugar and wheat.

\* \* \*



It was peaceful today. A great contrast to what transpired in the morning. Probably because nobody noticed me here. The birds chirped and squirrels ran up and down the trees. The sunlight was pleasant, sieved down through the babul leaves.

The marker over mother’s grave had worn off. The ones over my wife’s and son’s were wooden and won’t last beyond a few years. I had intended to replace them at first, but never got around to it. My sister’s grave marker had all but disappeared. The weeds had covered the place.

*I’m sorry..* I whispered. *I should have been here, instead of fighting another man’s war.* *Instead of fighting for a country that wasn’t mine against another country in yet another country. I should have stayed and died with you. I should have been a good husband and a good father.*

*I was away for four years in the Great War. Four years without seeing my wife and child. Four years where I abandoned her to her greedy brother. Four years after which I was given a second chance. A chance which I should have taken.*



‘You!’

The voice was too familiar. The last time I heard it was from the depths of a storm drain. 

‘Not now, Qazi. I am leaving.. Just let me be..’

‘No, you get out now! You unbeliever! Hypocrite! Traitor!’ The qazi’s spittle spotted his beard. His followers stood at a distance. Their courage depended on the qazi’s.

I raised my palm, signalling that I was leaving. Walking away. I didn’t have the strength to shove him into another drain.

‘If I see you again near my mosque, I will dig up those graves and you can carry your cursed family back with you.’

The qazi knew he had spoken too much. I could see it in his soul, when I ran towards him with murder in my eyes.
