Ever since my mom discovered what I was up to, I've been disturbed by how unfazed she seems. She lost her cool, and we had a screaming fit once or twice in the heat of the moment. But now that her worst fears have come true, it's as if the switch that made her care has turned off.

Since the past few months, she had taken to watching a peculiar old sitcom after work, which, at first, seemed harmless enough. Yet, she started making subtle changes to our home, molding it to resemble a house briefly shown in one of the scenes. Someone 'known' had delivered these CDs that contained this ‘sitcom’. The entire set came in transparent plastic covers, so there was no way of knowing the title. It had been years since I’d seen my mom on the couch instead of sitting at the dining table under an overhead light, chewing her food in the silence of the suburbs at 10 p.m. Even before she found this CD set, the only interaction we had was a glance when I entered the kitchen to retrieve my refrigerated skincare while she quietly ate her dinner. I purposely had my dinner at 8 p.m. so I wouldn't have to be in her vicinity.

I didn’t know her routine anymore—when she woke up, when she slept, or how often she worked early or late shifts. Despite her night shifts, she’d come home to eat whatever was prepared and then leave within the hour. Then, she started watching this sitcom more frequently and thus took fewer late-night shifts. I occasionally stood behind the couch, curious to watch the show, but only for a few seconds.

She never invited me to sit, and I didn’t feel inclined to either, but it seemed like some random old show about 20s and 30s, similar to *F.R.I.E.N.D.S.* I wondered how many seasons it even had, as it seemed never-ending, with a new scene playing every night with a bunch of characters that I hadn't encountered before, rarely any repeats. My door would usually be closed while she was at home.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. But then, I noticed her expressions shifting subtly. She went from faint chuckles, her large eyes flickering with a rare glint at the dated 80s laugh track, to an intense, almost trance-like focus. Even when I sat before the television, my gaze often drifted to her rather than the screen. As weeks passed, her fixation deepened, as if the show had trapped her in its grasp. Its glow cast long, flickering shadows, dancing across the walls and half-closed curtains. This was unlike her—she was a woman who never easily found amusement, moving through life like a dark, distant orb—serious, unnoticed, unreachable. The house grew heavy as if the walls absorbed her silent obsession.

The changes around the house began with the arrival of a wooden bookshelf. It wasn’t a particularly large one, but it needed to be mounted on the wall. Two men arrived to deliver it, and I initially thought they had the wrong house. When I asked, they confirmed they were at Sarah Hart’s house, and that’s when I realized it was Mom’s order.

She returned home late that evening, around 9 p.m., and, instead of her usual leisurely dinner, she hurried through her meal. Without a word, she tied her hair back and began taking precise measurements for the bookshelf, still in her nurse's uniform. I was puzzled but intrigued. It wasn’t like Mom to tackle home projects, and I wondered if someone at work had suggested it. Despite the oddity, I offered to help, and she didn’t hesitate. It was the first time in years we worked together. Her quiet commands, my silent compliance. It was strange, almost serene, to share that moment with her, a rare glimpse of teamwork that felt alien in our strained relationship. We completed the installation, but its purpose remained unclear. Neither of us was an avid reader, so I placed some anime figurines on the shelves, adding a hint of personality. The next day, I found they’d been removed and returned to my room.

Then, the bookshelf remained empty, as though its emptiness was its intended state. I didn’t ask her about it, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. Why had she gone through the effort to set it up, only to leave it vacant? The question lingered, adding to the growing list of mysteries that surrounded my mother.

All I knew was to give her space, prepare our meals as I always did, and maintain the order of the house. She managed everything else—bills, and fees, all paid and settled without a word. Each month, on the 5th, a fixed allowance appeared in my account, likely the day her salary was credited. It was, as if, she didn’t want to interact with me under any circumstances. I had little reason to excel in school, yet I studied hard, propelled by an insatiable urge to flee this suffocating way of existing. And somehow, her obsessive watching of that enigmatic sitcom, with its peculiar grip on her, only quickened my desire to escape this creeping malaise.

This month, in May, I started to secretly pack my things to move to my stepdad’s place. He blurted it out once during a call with my mother, and all hell broke loose—leading to a huge argument that I didn't suspect. He and I are far from close, I don’t even know what he does for work. I am about to start college anyway so I am optimistic that I can endure that old man for a month or two before that. On call, at times, he sounded overtly concerned when he knew that my mother was at home. Similarly, on the contrary, he would quickly find excuses or some task to attend to once he got to know that my mom wasn’t around or had gone off to her night shift.

She works as a nurse at a psychiatric facility, a job she got through her former psychiatrist. I don’t know much about why she had to see a doctor in the first place, and neither does my stepdad. All I know is that she needed 'help to cope' when my biological father passed away.

My mom and stepdad got married a year after the incident, mainly because he needed help with his daughter but couldn’t afford at-home medical staff. He hoped that being a nurse, my mother would instinctively nurture her, and my mother played her part too. My stepsister died just five months into their marriage from an illness that was rampant at the time, and after that, he found our presence ‘too transactional’, especially with my mother. They had nothing in common. He was always jolly and well-spoken, but I don’t believe my mom was in any way romantically interested in him. Two years into their marriage, he handed her divorce papers, and she signed them without batting an eye. It seemed to break his heart, but my step-grandmother once expressed surprise that my mother didn’t demand anything for taking care of her dying grandchild. She earned some brownie points from his family but they don’t care if she even exists anymore, just like my biological extended family. As always, my mother doesn’t seem to care either. She continued to go in and out of her shifts, despite all the drastic changes around her. It was as if she hadn’t experienced any turbulence. She kept going, like a shell of a person. Like a hamster on a wheel, unfazed and somehow forcing normalcy upon herself.

After the divorce, my mom rented a two-bedroom apartment near our old town's cemetery. She claimed it was the cheapest place for us to "live comfortably," but now, with distrust in my heart, I can't help but feel there's more to her choice. My father is buried in that cemetery. Though he passed when I was 11, nearly six years ago, I remember little of him or the circumstances of his death. It struck me like a phantom blow—sharp but leaving no trace. His memory is elusive. For a man who was my mother’s first love and the father of her child, his absence should have left an aching void, yet it remains strangely absent from my heart.

I can summon only a single instance of my mom shedding tears—a fleeting moment when she emerged from what I recall as a military interrogation room. A towering, intimidating man in a stark grey uniform held me back as I screamed, desperate for her return. But when she finally stepped through those foreboding gates, after what felt like a day, something in her had shifted. The grief that clung to her upon entering seemed to dissipate, replaced by a rigid composure that was almost unnerving. Her movements were mechanical, as though steeled by some grim revelation. The atmosphere thickened with an unspoken tension as the days went on. The silence that followed her return from that room was deafening, filled with an unsettling finality of his absence.

Soon, she decided that I was old enough to look after myself. I told myself that she just had to take up more shifts to cover the expenses. We received a casualty payout, which my stepdad redirected to a trust for my college and other future expenses. He made it pretty clear that he didn’t want to contribute a single penny to help with my upbringing.

I don’t know who’s on my team anymore. The complexities faced by the adults in my life didn’t escape my notice. I went through a phase where I tried to provoke an outburst from her, but she somehow knew that after my father's demise, I couldn’t tolerate a messy house, uncooked meals, an empty stomach, any disarray, or being out of school for too long. Anything I did to get yelled at only resulted in me cleaning up my mess while she worked for hours, always somehow returning at 10 p.m.

Coming back to how my mother began altering the house’s interior—the bookshelf appeared here, a photo frame there, and a side table shifted from one shadowy corner to another. The floorboards groaned beneath her weight in the hushed hours of the night as I lay cocooned in my bed, the dim yellow light seeped through the narrow crack beneath my door like a whisper. I woke up in the morning to be bemused by the nocturnal artistry my mother used to conjure. I, fortunately, being a heavy sleeper, remained undisturbed by the whims in her moods that compelled her midnight endeavors.

In the cold months, when CDs had just first arrived, as if they were Christmas gifts my mum had gotten for herself, I didn't stand to watch because our living room didn’t have a working heater. But as the seasons grew warmer, so did my stays, which gradually became a few seconds longer. I’d stand behind the couch, and glance at the screen, with no context for the jokes or the characters.

I was curious as to why my mum found this show so amusing and addictive. I’ve had my share of binge-worthy shows on Netflix or Prime, but this sitcom my mum watched seemed never-ending, which I simply chalked up to it being an old show that went on for much longer durations. But then, one night, in April, I witnessed a chilling spectacle as my mother, with an expression devoid of emotion, grasped a newly acquired flower vase and hurled it to the floor, shattering it into countless fragments. The vase, a once beautiful piece with a bronze glaze shimmering over its hammered surface, lay in ruin.

The sight froze me, and the first words that escaped my lips were, “Are you hurt? Mom, stay still! I will go get the broom and your slippers.” Yet, even as I spoke, a chill crept down my spine, for the calm in her demeanor was far more terrifying than the destruction she had wrought.

“Evelyn, love—I am okay.” She uttered with a smile. “It just… had to be done.” She smiled, which made me smile too. It was wiped off immediately as I noticed the shredded glass on the floor. “I-” But as I began my sentence, I saw a Kintsugi kit. It made sense then.

“Mom, I just cleaned the floors this afternoon. If you wanted to do... art, I guess, you could’ve thrown the va-” I was about to rant but then I saw my mom’s expressions as she bent down and analysed a piece of the broken vase. She remained unnervingly still, meticulously picking up shards, her fingers trembling as she scrutinized each fragment. Her eyes widened and narrowed as her neck budged.

‘Is she even taking care of herself anymore?’ I wondered.

She swallowed hard, as the color drained entirely from her face. She bent forward like a wilting stem, her movements rigid, as if at any moment her joints would’ve creaked at unnatural angles, without any human grace. Then, she lifted her gaze to meet mine, and at that moment, I felt the weight of her stare that made my blood run cold, compelling me to avert my eyes as dread coiled in my chest. I looked away towards the paused video on the screen. It was as if the television itself held its breath.

The title read, '**S.8 Ep. 17. The Watch Cometh to Seek the Man**.'

I quietly made my way to the kitchen, gathering what I needed with deliberate care, each step muffled against the cold floor. In the heart of that dull living room light, she wandered around, her bare feet crunching over the shattered remnants of the vase. The sound was a delicate, unsettling symphony—sharp and brittle. Lost in some unfathomable reverie, her gaze fixed on the fragments scattered like fallen stars. I dared not linger, the stillness urging me back to the relative coziness of my room. Yet, even as I retreated, the image of her, standing amidst the ruins of that beautiful vase, lingered in my mind—as if the very fabric of our bond had been torn, revealing a darkness that had always lurked just beneath the surface.

By the time I returned to place my skincare back in the refrigerator, she had already begun methodically collecting the shattered fragments and arranging them with precision on the newly acquired center table. This table, a recent purchase from a local thrift store, was identical to one I had once seen in the mysterious sitcom she obsessively watched.

Naively, I had assumed the show was merely a source of inspiration for her. Soon, she retreated to her bedroom and audibly bolted her room. That night, she skipped dinner.

At school, my mind was consumed with thoughts of my mother, and I couldn’t focus on anything else. I found myself obsessing over whether I should break a vase like she did, maybe to understand her pain. After school, I excitedly bought two vases and a Kintsugi kit, pondering if I could piece them together. But when I got home, I couldn’t bring myself to break them. Instead, I noticed the dust on my vases and the shards of the one my mother had shattered the night before. Irritated, I cleaned them up, scrubbing the floor until it gleamed, feeling the bitterness rise in me as I rushed through my routine. This detour was making me late and annoyed. I had to get meals cooked by 2 p.m., and yet, it was already past. By the time I finished, I placed the flowers in the vase and set it on the dining table, but the nagging thought of what my mother had done the night before still lingered.

I decided to sleep it off, hoping to escape the unease that plagued me. Yet, I was awakened at night by the gleam of light and the usual laughter soundtrack from the television in the living room. The floorboards groaned beneath my weight as I reluctantly made my way from my room.

To my shock, my mother twisted her neck with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto mine from where she sat, frozen. The movement was too sharp, too deliberate. It felt as though I caught her amid some act. I swallowed hard, my throat tight with apprehension, and turned my gaze to the television. My eyes, at first, sought the time in the top right corner of the screen. But as I looked longer, my focus faltered, and it drifted to the video that flickered—no longer playing, but paused.

Instinctively, I think I read it aloud, “**The One with David’s New Vase**,” rubbing my eyes. A flicker of surprise crossed my mind, but David was such a common name; so I let the unease I was about to feel slip away, dismissing it without a second thought. Her eyes gleamed with the reflection of the television from the window, and her small mouth twitched ever so slightly. ‘Why do her eyes always seem so watery?’ I thought to myself. They were so wide, that I was certain that it must have been one of the reasons men were drawn to her. 

I struggled to understand what I was meant to feel as she stared at me, her gaze fixated as if she had just witnessed a ghost materializing before her. What was most unsettling, though, was that as our eyes locked, she swiftly unpaused the video, and the show resumed with another meaningless joke, followed by the same maddening laughter. But it was her reaction that compelled me to step closer this time. I walked towards the screen and sat beside her. She shifted to make space for me, but she was no longer looking at me. I assumed she didn’t have dinner, I noted with quiet certainty—most likely because I hadn’t cooked anything that day.

This episode seemed familiar. I remember the title was something like "**S2 Ep. 22**" or "**Ep. 02**"—something of that sort. **S2** probably was finished off in the initial days of her watching this sitcom, so I was certain she was replaying an episode. She seemed uneasy beside me and quickly, paused the show again. 

"Unpause the video," I blurted out.

"Love, since you're awake now, I wanted to ask what you'd like for dinner," she said, looking at me with a newly concerned expression, furrowing her brows. "Are you well?"

"Am I well? I just woke up from a five-hour-long sleep. What would you do if I told you I'm not well?" I remarked, nervously pulling at the skin around my nail beds. She noticed and I wished for her to reach out to hold my hand.

"I took care of your dying sister. I take care of multiple patients every day. I'll, of course, take care of you if you're not well," I remember her saying this calmly.

"Don't change the topic. In fact—let's bond! I also want to see what's with this damn sitcom you've been addicted to. What's its name so that I can Google it?"

She sighs, "Evelyn, are you not well? It's bizarre how you've suddenly come to talk—"

"Would you rather catch me in the brick of death too so you finally fucking act on your motherly instincts—if you even have any? What the hell is this sitcom, anyway? How do I even get into your head to understand why the fuck you do whatever you do?" I yelled, my voice rising in frustration.

No reaction. Not a single response from her. I didn't even know what I expected that night.

"I'm sorry. Carry on." I got up from the couch, and almost immediately I was startled by the landline ring. "It must be Jeff," I muttered, walking away to speak with my stepdad and cool off. 

The entire conversation with him revolved around my health, school, career, and tennis tournaments—something he wasn't too fond of because I didn’t necessarily win any medals, so he wanted me to focus on my studies instead. And then, inevitably, my mother.

"So, did she cook for you at the end?" he asked with a casual tone. He was like a human diary, a stranger to whom I told everything, trusting he wouldn't share it. He wasn't worried about me; I never felt obligated to lie to him, as I never saw him in person or as a guardian, even. I told him about the sitcom, and he scoffed, sounding shocked himself by whatever had unfolded today.

"No. She said she was waiting for me to decide what to order."

Silence.

"I wish she'd cooked, though," I blurted out, hating myself instantly, feeling as though my facade was cracking. "She's a bad cook, though. I take that back," I quickly followed up.

"I’ve told you multiple times that—anyways, I'll order you some pizza. I think you like chicken and jalapenos?" he blandly asked. I hated chicken on my pizza. I figured he didn’t want to order, but he did it out of pity.

"Sure."

"Will do. Anyway, save up your allowance for occasions like... this. I could never figure out if your mother even has a heart or awareness of how her actions impact—"

"Jeff, just text me when you place the order. Thank you," I cut him off, hanging up after a brief farewell.

As I placed the receiver back, I slowly traversed the hallway, taking a shallow breath, and turned my gaze upon the now unpaused video from a distance. She did not notice my presence this time, her attention wholly consumed by the flickering screen, her focus unbroken—much like the relentless rhythm of the damned sitcom that had ensnared her every thought. 

Having the word ‘vase’ in the title seemed too consequential. She was rewatching an episode for the first time to my knowledge. I zoomed out and refocused on the changes in the interior of my house, and it occurred to me how I waved off many of her recent endeavors as mere inspirations drawn from what she watched or must've heard from others. The center table and the bookshelf were the first few ones to catch my attention, but what struck me was how she somehow found the same one I saw in the sitcom. I walked a little further to glance at the dining table and saw my vase had been replaced by a newly refurbished one, adorned with Kintsugi art, the bronze glaze now held together by delicate veins of gold. It glowed softly under the dim light, the lily flowers I had bought now resting within it.

‘Where’s the vase I bought?’ I wondered. 

Then my world went still.

“Kintsugi encompasses the concepts of non-attachment, the acceptance of change—” At these words, I turned my head toward the television. The characters droned on about how they shouldn’t throw away their family heirloom, but instead, repair the vase. As this dialogue played out, the camera zoomed in on the vase’s broken pieces. My mother paused the video for a few seconds, just for it to continue.

The next scene showed the zoomed-in vase—and to my utter shock, the same one my mom had ‘fixed’—bronze, glazed with a hammered texture on the exterior. I watched in disbelief as a character, who seemed like a child, made a cut on his finger, and bled a golden substance. There was no explanation; it was just something the plot needed to move forward, meaningless. It was as if the show tried to piece itself together from what sitcom was at face value. 

Then, another character cracked a ‘joke,’ "Why did the broken vase refuse to be repaired with Kintsugi?” 

“Because it knew no matter how much gold filled its cracks, it would never be whole again. The fractures were permanent, just like the scars they left on its soul." This was followed by the usual laugh track.

The scene unfolded with cartoonishly bright lights, exaggerated facial expressions that somehow captured the entire spectrum of human emotions, and smiles that should have brought comfort, yet there was something undeniably off. The canned laughter echoed unnaturally as if mocking the very idea of humor. Its timing awkwardly stretched, hanging in the air. The actors, with their forced gestures, wide smiles, and flat delivery, moved through their lines like marionettes whose strings had been pulled too tightly. They tried—oh, how they tried—to replicate the easy rhythm of a sitcom, but it was a hollow imitation. I stood there, feeling the time stretch. I didn't want to disturb her, nor risk another pause. The laughter came too early, too late, or not at all. The humor on screen grew hollow, a vague trap. The colours were unnaturally bright, the background music lingering too long, as if the show itself awaited something to break. But it never did.

It persisted an unrelenting spectacle—a grotesque parody of what should have been ‘funny’, familiar, safe even, warping the very essence of the genre into something malformed. The characters moved quite unnaturally, with their costumes as though they had been pulled from the wreckage of the 80s—tattered, velvety, bleached denim, and black leather pants clung to characters. But their attire, or the actors themselves, changed ever so subtly when the camera's gaze was averted. It was a trick of the eye, a slight shift that unsettled more than it should. And then there was the script, a wretched thing—so vile in its execution, it could scarcely be called writing. It was at that moment, when the dialogues sank in, that I realized I had never truly listened to what was unfolding on the screen. I had assumed, foolishly, that this was a ‘sitcom’—after all, the laugh track howled, urging me to believe as much.

As the episode neared its end, I realised that the conclusion didn’t make sense—it had nothing to do with Kintsugi or anything about mending or healing. Instead, the scene ended with an airplane crashing, as it defied physics, into what looked like a toy-like twin tower structure. The characters scrambled, working frantically to “fix what’s broken,” applying liquid gold ‘glue’ from the bronze vase they had mended earlier. In one instance, a character also mentioned that that was the only plane ‘we have’.

But then, the scene that I was fixated on was the room in which the characters were fixing the vase earlier; something in the background caught my eye—undeniable details that had manifested into my reality in the past few weeks. The interiors of the house.

The layout. It was ours. But our interior had become more like the room on screen.

It wasn’t that the house was a replica, but the layout—the layout was identical. Everything else, though, seemed to be shaped and modified by my mom, with small tweaks here and there added each night. We, as usual, never spoke about why she was changing the layout, but I could see it becoming more and more like the one on the show that I watched that night. It was hard to believe that the show intended to come off as anything but uncanny and unsettling as it did to me. Yet, if you put logic aside, it offered an alternative explanation for all those troubling little details I couldn’t help but notice. I stepped from the shadows, but she did not unpause the video, nor did she turn back. She heard me—of that, I was certain. I saw her shoulders twitch, but she carried on, undisturbed, watching the next episode. “**Lilies died but the thought doesn’t**,” the title read.

‘What is the meaning of this now?’ I remember asking myself. I walked to my room and shut the door behind me, seeking solace in the quiet, in the solitude of my thoughts.

When I woke the next day, I discovered that all the CDs had vanished—hoping that they were consigned to the trash. After school, I returned home, walking up the patio after stepping off the bus, when I noticed an elderly woman sitting there mumbling to herself. She seemed well off, or simply just well dressed, it was hard to distinguish; with her hair tied too neatly. At first, I wondered from afar if it was Jeff’s mother, but it wasn’t. 

I approached her, asking if I knew her, my patience already fraying as instead she repeatedly asked if my mother was home. I offered to deliver the message, but she insisted that she could only speak to my mother in person, and not over the phone, or through any intermediary. She even mentioned that she couldn’t come to meet her the next day, which I found incredibly odd. Fidgeting with her tiny handbag, she continued to repeat the need to see my mom in a trembling voice. I wondered, in a fleeting moment of doubt, if I was the only one still tethered to some semblance of reason while every adult around me lost their mind. But I digress. As soon as she said, “My son was stationed with David during the research—,” I lost it. Just as I was about to ignore her and head inside, she halted me in my tracks with her words, “Child—Girl, listen to me. This is about the CDs.”

“What about the CDs?” I narrowed my eyes.

“So you didn’t watch—?” she continued, “Well, it shouldn’t be any of your concern, do you understand me?” she continued in a low murmur, “Just inform your mother that she has to mail the CDs to the next in line. One rule she shouldn’t have broken was to rewatch an… episode. It made it quite clear that it gets to know if one does.”

I stared at her in silence, nodding without fully grasping the meaning behind her cryptic words. Who was ‘it’? I ushered her away, and after she left, I attempted to open my door, only to find it locked from the inside. My mother had stayed home that day—a fact which, in my mind, unsettled me to the core. I had never seen her at home while the sun still lingered in the sky. I rang the doorbell, and when she opened the door, she immediately asked me, “Do you know how to get copies of CDs on PC?”

“Oh—Hey, an old woman was here. She mentioned that she knows Dad, and asked to mail those CDs,” I started.

“Just tell me if you can get it done?” she interrupted, her voice flat, unemotional. I complied, as I always did, too weary to ask questions—hoping that the task would grant me some respite, some peace of mind.

She handed me a list of seasons and specific episodes that I had to copy. Which just mounted up to four episodes. In total, there were nine CDs, but my mother gave me only those that she wanted to get copied with an instruction not to watch them. And so, I listened to her, as always. No questions, just obedience. I even found one CD, scrawled in thick black marker, with a message that read: “DO NOT COPY THESE CDs.” Yet I copied it anyway.

Without a word, my mother silently packed up the CDs, stuffed them into a box, and mailed them to the "next person." The whole process felt wrapped in secrecy, an unsettling silence. I said nothing when my stepdad called later that night, nor did I speak of it ever again. The next day, she moved the PC to her room and gave me a new Mac laptop. While I was delighted by the gift, a quiet unease lingered. What had she done with those videos? Why had the old woman warned against replaying them?

That same night, I overheard her muttering, "She can't even remember his face, can she?" The next few weeks, my focus shifted to school, but I noticed my mother arriving home earlier each day. Then, one evening, a soft knock at my door. I opened it to find her with a pen drive, asking me to transfer content so she could watch it on the TV. In her room, the PC was on, her silhouette cast in the dim light as she watched me work. A photo frame on her bedside caught my eye—it was of our once-happy family. I didn’t linger, dismissing it as a relic of a past I couldn’t grasp. As I transferred the files, a chill crept over me from her watchful gaze. I folded my arms tightly, trying to stave off a sense of anxiousness. Her presence unnerved me. I knew if I had asked, “Mom, please stop. You’re scaring me,” I would have only met more of her cold, impenetrable quiet. In that moment, I felt less than invisible—more like a mere whisper, ignored and drowned out by the monologues that consumed her.

Curiosity drove me to probe deeper into the folders. To my astonishment, the episodes had increased from four to seven. "Did you add new episodes after I copied them yesterday?" I asked, my voice tinged with suspicion. Her response was a mere murmur, a hesitant "Hmm," that seemed to hang in the air. But she didn’t know how to do it, or at least that’s what I assumed yesterday. Copying wasn’t a hard task, just took some time. If she had learned, she would have copied those episodes herself. 

The episodes were titled as:

**‘S.2 Ep. 12. The One with David’s New Vase’**

**‘S.2 Ep. 12. Singers don’t sing along’’**

**‘S.8 Ep. 17. The Watch Cometh to Seek the Man’**

**‘S.11 Ep. 19. New ones come with the embryos’**

**‘S.12 Ep. 1. The one in which David watches in Agony’**

**‘S.12 Ep. 2. David is being watched’**

"Sweat beaded on my forehead as I asked, “Mom, is there something I need to know?”

“I shouldn’t want you to know,” she responded instantly, her voice a fragile thread of withheld emotion, “but the more I endure this alone, the more I despise—this. I wonder what you’d say to the weight that suffocates me.”

I turned back, only to find she had moved closer. Her skeletal hands rested on the chair’s back, and she loomed over me, her face cast in the pale glow of the screen. The light distorted her features, casting deep shadows that made her wrinkles stand out like cracks in a fragile mask. I swallowed hard, craving a glass of water to soothe the dryness that gripped my throat.

She hated me. She always did.

Dad—my Dad, as well as Jeff, assured me she didn’t, but I knew better. How could they even fathom a mother despising her daughter? She shrank into herself when Dad was gone, tolerating my presence. While he was alive, she taunted me, blaming me for the life she lost. If I misbehaved, she locked me away, withholding dinner without hesitation. No blanket tucks, no bedtime stories, no interest in my life, no packed lunch, or planned birthday surprise. She didn’t even ask about my studies or cook a meal for me.

That was Dad, though. I don’t remember how, but I know he did. 

Even fleeting warmth from him felt distant, like a shadow too faint to grasp. My memory of him was broken, erased pieces leaving only a basket of stale bread and cracked eggs, symbols of a past that couldn’t be pieced together, thick with sorrow. Dad’s work kept him away, leaving me exposed to her cold indifference. I learned to behave, to cook when he was home, hoping he'd take me on his trips. He was a fleeting sunset, warm yet blurring in my mind. Why was that? All I had of him was goodness, and of her, only pain.

Then, as though she had heard my thoughts, she replied, 'Evelyn, in November last year, David’s old colleagues reached out to me. They told me he’s alive, and I could see him—' Her voice trembled, heavy as if she didn’t believe her own words. I knew exactly what she meant: a cult born of grief and desperation, broken people clinging to wild conspiracies. They rejected the government's explanation of natural calamities and shared ideas of alien abductions, monstrous sea creatures, and worse. For years, I had known them, yet my mother, always the strongest, had stood apart—resilient, unyielding. But now, in that room, I struggled to understand how she, the woman who once seemed unshakable, could be drawn into their web of delusion. How could she falter in the face of such desperate hope?

“Mom, you wanted us to get away from that life. That’s why you married Jeff. That’s why we moved here. We did everything so you’d be yourself again!” I poured my heart out, but she just stepped back looking down at me in disbelief.

“Evelyn what are you talking about, marrying Jeff had nothing to do with—”

“Why did you do all those things, only to circle back to this?” I burst out, my voice booming with rage. “I thought I was supposed to forget Dad, forget my old life, the old you, my cousins, my friends—the old me. We were meant to start over with Jeff, in a new setting, but you managed to wreck that too! We moved here to start fresh, and now you're obsessively transforming this shit old hell hole of a house to resemble that fucked up one from those cursed CDs. I can’t keep pretending I don’t care when it’s clear you don’t care about how these constant upheavals affect me! I just want to be eighteen, to be free of this, to never have to see your face again!’

"Every time I talk with you Evelyn, I am just reminded of what a disappointment—"

But before she could complete it, I yelled back, "What a disappointment I am! Or, what a disappointment Dad was? What have you exactly done to make anything better?"

Silence. Again. But it seemed as if she was letting my words sink in, absorbing them in a way that made my skin crawl. I couldn't bear the oppressive pause any longer, so, impulsively, I moved the cursor to the latest episode and clicked it.

In an instant, she lunged forward, almost knocking over the chair in a frantic attempt to snatch the mouse from my grasp. Her bony fingers trembled as they reached out, and her face twisted into a grimace of desperation. The dim light from the desk lamp cast long shadows across the cluttered workspace—papers strewn about, a cup half-filled with cold tea, and a few old photographs tucked under a stack of forgotten receipts. They started tumbling down the desk as we stirred. 

The wooden desk creaked under the sudden movement, and the mouse slipped slightly on the surface. Her small frame was deceptively strong, but I managed to hold her back. For a brief moment, our eyes locked, hers filled with panic and mine with confusion. I couldn't even see the screen properly. Despite her frailty, her resolve was fierce, and she fought to get closer to the screen. My heart raced as I noticed the episode had just seconds before it ended.

‘Exit! Exit it Evelyn, please, or else,’ she kept repeating, her voice cracking under the strain. I didn’t understand what she meant—until I did. The player stopped abruptly, exiting on its own, and a new episode was created, as if by some sinister magic trick. Its title read: **S.12 Ep. 3. The One with the Flooded Swimming Pool**. I just sat there, staring, as she let me go and brought her hands to her face.

‘No. No. No. No,’ she muttered under her breath, her hands covering her face as she backed away, her shoulders quivering with soft sobs. She composed herself suddenly, her demeanor shifting with unsettling ease, and she instructed me with an eerie calmness. Something inside me clicked. I glanced at the episode numbers again. I clearly remembered copying **S.11 Ep. 19. New Ones Come with the Embryos**, which had seemed like the last episode from one of the CDs, the final one in season eleven. If she hadn’t added the new episodes, then how had they appeared?

While she stepped outside in the living room, sobbing softly, yet with her usual lack of reaction to my presence, I seized the moment. Quickly, since I wanted to try something that night, I emailed myself one of the episodes—**S.2 Ep. 12. Singers Don’t Sing Along**. I made sure it was sent before closing all the tabs, leaving only the pen drive folder and the original files open. Without saying another word except apologising to her, I retreated to my room, the silence heavy, my heart pounding. I climbed into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin, trying to make sense of what just happened, as her soft sobs echoed faintly through the walls.

I switched on my phone and downloaded the video. The file was massive, far larger than a thirty-minute episode should be. It struck me as peculiar, another anomaly in the growing list of oddities surrounding these recordings. As the download continued, my gaze drifted around the room. The dim streetlight filtered through the window, casting shifting shadows on the walls. The still air, broken only by the rustling leaves outside, added a strange calm. Though this house never felt like home, there was an unsettling familiarity, a misplaced comfort after the earlier chaos with my mother. The room, quiet and waiting, seemed to harbor secrets in its corners. The tranquil night almost mocked the turmoil that had just unfolded.

As the video finished downloading, I skipped ahead to moments before the end. The story, oddly enough, centered around a bookshelf. The characters moved with that same eerie, artificial grace, and the vacant surroundings felt unnervingly real, yet somehow detached. It wasn't CGI, but it had the same unsettling quality. The sensation returned, the same creeping dread I felt when I had stolen glances at the episodes my mum watched from the hallway. Suddenly, the screen went black. Panic seized me. I shook the phone, tapping it against my palm, desperate for it to come back to life. It had been fully charged—what could have gone wrong? A minute later, the phone rebooted, returning to the home screen, as if nothing had happened. I tried to dismiss it as a glitch, but the unease lingered.

But when I returned to the gallery in hest, I noticed another video file sitting next to the original one. The first video still existed, but now there was a second. How had this new file appeared? The calm of the night outside seemed a world away from the growing tension that pressed down on me, whispering that this was only the beginning. Curious, I opened the new file and checked its details. My breath caught when I saw the title: 

**S.2 Ep. 13. As She Watched Under the Blanket.**
