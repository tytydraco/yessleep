I never thought I would be here, writing this. Three days ago, I was ready to end everything. The plan was clear in my mind—I would take my bike, go on the wrong side of the road, and crash head-on into a truck. No one would know it was suicide. It would just look like an accident. That way, I wouldn’t have to live with the pain, and no one would ever question why.

This all started with a breakup. I was dating a girl—let’s call her Elizabeth. We met at my friend David’s birthday party. David and I have been friends for over a decade. I wasn’t looking for a relationship, but when I saw her, something felt different. She was a traditional Indian girl, someone I could see a future with. I wanted something serious, and she seemed like the kind of person worth committing to.

At first, everything was perfect. She wanted to take things slow, to build a strong foundation before committing. She even said we should wait until after our board exams to make things official. But after a week, I asked her again, and she said yes. From that point on, things moved fast. She helped me with my studies, even though she was in arts and I was in science. She couldn’t understand my subjects, but she still pushed me to study, to be better. She taught me prayers, told me about Indian traditions—it all made me feel like she was “the one.”

But then, things started to shift. She wanted to keep our relationship private. That was fine by me—I didn’t want extra attention either. But over time, it felt like she was hiding it a little too much. She wouldn’t meet me in public. She didn’t want her friends to know. And when we argued about it, she decided to leave.

The timing of it all was brutal. Just a week before, she had come to my house for Ganpati Puja. She met my mother. And then, suddenly, she was gone.

I tried to talk it out, but she kept giving reasons that didn’t make sense. It felt like she had already made up her mind, and nothing I said mattered. That’s when I gave up.

David, my best friend, had been neutral at first. He told me she should have at least tried to work things out. But then, behind my back, he told her that what she did was completely right. That she should move on. That none of this mattered.

That shattered me.

My world was already small—I don’t have many friends. Just David, and John, a school friend. After losing Elizabeth and realizing that David had never really been on my side, it felt like I had lost everything.

John was the only one who stuck by me. He tried to help, but by then, I had given up on myself. I stopped studying. I stopped doing anything productive. My entire day was just scrolling through my phone, distracting myself however I could. Porn, social media, anything to keep my mind away from Elizabeth. But it didn’t work.

The board exams were coming closer, and I wasn’t prepared at all. My teachers had started saying I wouldn’t be able to do anything now. And honestly, they were right. I wasn’t even trying anymore.

Even then, suicide wasn’t on my mind. Not yet.

But then, the practical exams started. I had to go to school for them, and that’s when everything hit me. On the last practical—Physical Education—everyone was signing each other’s shirts. John was getting his shirt signed by a lot of people. Since I was always with him, they asked me to sign too, but it felt like they were just doing it out of formality. No one actually cared.

That was the moment something inside me snapped.

I felt completely invisible. Like I had no real importance. And that’s when I decided—I was going to kill myself that day.

I didn’t tell anyone. I just planned it out in my head. After school, I would go home, take my bike, and ride straight into a truck. Quick. Simple. No one would even know it was suicide.

But then, John asked me to drop him home. He said we should take a long ride first. I agreed, knowing this would be my last ride before I ended it all.

We were riding fast, as we always did. I was at 90 km/h on the highway when, out of nowhere, a car appeared. Before I could react, we crashed.

Everything went blank for a second.

John was mostly fine—just a few scratches. But I wasn’t. My arms and legs were bruised badly. I still can’t put weight on my right leg. I can’t believe I’m even alive right now.

We somehow made it to the hospital. John took care of everything since I was in no state to. After that, we went to his house, and that’s where he called my mother. He didn’t tell her over the phone—he wanted her to come in person.

When she arrived, something happened that I never expected.

John—who I had never seen cry in our two years of friendship—broke down in front of my mother. He kept saying it was all his fault. That if he hadn’t asked me to drop him home, this wouldn’t have happened. He blamed himself.

That was the moment I realized—I wasn’t alone.

I saw how much he cared. I saw my mother’s shock, my sister’s tears when she hugged me. And that’s when it finally hit me.

If I had died that day, I would have left all of them behind. I would have transferred all my pain to them.

It has been three days since the accident. Three days since I last thought about suicide. Before that, I couldn’t go a single second without thinking about it. But now, I know I can’t do it. No matter how much I hate my situation, I can’t abandon the people who love me.

I don’t know what I’m going to do about my board exams. They’re in five days, and I have no preparation. If this had happened a week ago, I would have seen this as another reason to kill myself. But I can’t anymore. Not after seeing how much John, my mother, and my sister care about me.

If you’re thinking about suicide, please understand this:

*Killing yourself doesn’t end pain. It just transfers it to your loved ones.*

Even when it feels like there’s no way out, even when you feel invisible, there are people who care about you. You just might not see it yet.

I was lucky. The accident saved me before I could make the biggest mistake of my life.

If you’re struggling, please talk to someone. Please hold on. You matter more than you think.
