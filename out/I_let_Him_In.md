I wake up to the sound of my phone buzzing. Another message. Another nightmare in the form of a text. My hands tremble as I unlock the screen, and there it is—an image of me, but not me. My face, twisted, forced onto something obscene, something that never happened but looks real enough to ruin me.

A new message follows immediately.

**“If I send this out, people won’t care if it’s fake. They’ll believe what they see. They’ll believe I own you. But I’m feeling generous. Just send me one real picture, and I promise I’ll stop.”**

My stomach knots. I tell myself I won’t do it. I tell myself no rational person would give in. But then I hear the soft breathing from the next room. My son. He’s sleeping peacefully, unaware of the nightmare I’ve fallen into.

I try to ignore it, but the messages keep coming.

**“Don’t ignore me. You think you’re safe? Imagine them all looking at you. At your body. At the mother, the woman, the thing made for them to play with. It doesn’t matter if it’s true. It only matters that they believe.”**

I feel sick. I feel trapped. And against every rational thought, I do it. Just one picture. Just to make it stop. I send it.

My phone buzzes immediately.

**“Good girl.”**

My blood runs cold.

Then another notification. Not from him. From someone else.

My neighbor.

**“Well, well. Now you have to do what I say. Or maybe your son should see what his mother sends to strangers?”**

My breath catches in my throat. I drop the phone. My house, my life—none of it feels real anymore. The walls close in. There is no escape. They own me now.

And I know this is just the beginning.

The nightmare isn’t what they’ll do to me.

It’s what they’ll make me do to myself.

I try to tell myself there must be a way out. I pace the room, my hands trembling, my breath ragged. Every sound outside makes me flinch. Every vibration from my phone sends my heart slamming against my ribs. There has to be something I can do. Someone I can call. But who would believe me? Who could help me before it’s too late?

The next message comes through.

**“You’re thinking about running, aren’t you? That would be a mistake.”**

I stare at the screen, bile rising in my throat. How does he know? Is he watching me? My curtains are closed. My doors are locked. But suddenly, I feel naked. Exposed. There’s no way he can see me…right?

A follow-up message.

**“Open the front door.”**

I freeze. My entire body locks up in pure terror. No. No, I can’t. But I can’t ignore him either. Every second of silence feels like it’s tightening the noose around my neck. My phone buzzes again.

**“If you don’t open it in the next ten seconds, I’ll send your son’s school photos to every contact in your phone with a little note about his mother’s hobbies.”**

I suck in a sharp breath. My feet move on their own, carrying me toward the door like a puppet on strings. My hands shake as I undo the lock. Slowly, I pull the door open.

Nothing. The night is silent. The street is empty.

Then my phone buzzes again.

**“See? You can be a good girl when you try.”**

And then, the last message for the night.

**“Sweet dreams. We have more fun tomorrow.”**

I don’t sleep. I just sit in the dark, waiting for the next nightmare to begin.
