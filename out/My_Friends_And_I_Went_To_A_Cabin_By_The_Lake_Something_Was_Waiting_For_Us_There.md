My grandparents owned a cabin beside a lake. They rented it so they would have extra funds for their retirement. If it wasn’t being rented out, they offered to let me stay for the weekend. Normally I refused but an old friend of mine contacted me recently to catch up. I had some time off and the cabin was free. We arranged a trip down to the lake. She was going to bring her husband I’ve met a handful of times. She also suggestion to ask another friend of ours to join us. We all grew up together and there were enough rooms at the cabin. 

I arrived first and had gotten started to unpack when Brooke and her husband came walking down the trail. The path to the cabin wasn’t large enough for cars so they had to park a few minutes away. There were other cabins near us, but all of them were further down into the woods. At night you could see the lights through the branches and sometimes hear the neighbors.   

She hugged me and I helped them with their bags. Her husband was shorter than her with large glasses that made him look almost insect-like. His cheeks were red from walking such a short distance. I doubted being at a cabin was his sort of thing but he came along for Brooke.    

He nodded along when I started to chat away about the good old times with Brooke as we walked inside. A knock came from the door and I rushed over to answer it. We were expecting another couple. Jason and I grew up together. At some point, we had been as close as brothers but drifted apart after he was married.  

“It’s been forever! Did you have issues finding the place?” I asked him and peeked my head out the door looking for his wife.  

I didn’t see her and he walked past me into the cabin setting down a single bag. We had been to the cabin together before but this was the first time he was the one driving.  

“No, the GPS made it easy. I didn’t stop to eat on the way. Do was have anything?” He asked and didn’t address the fact he was alone.  

I gave Brooke a look which she returned signaling me to keep my mouth shut. I was a noisy person and I really, really wanted to know the gossip but I respected my friend more.  

After a batch of sandwiches, we all got changed to go swimming. It was still hot a humid out despite being so close to autumn. Brooke and Erwin stayed on the beach. She wanted to get a tan and he had a pile of books to read.  

I followed Jason to the edge of the dock. My grandparents had left behind their fishing gear. I’m sure it was all high-end stuff, but I didn’t know the first thing about it. I set it all down and got a pair of chairs set up so we could catch dinner after we were finished swimming.  

“Do you have your phone on you?” Jason asked.  

I shook my head confused over the question. My swim trunks didn’t even have pockets. Without another word, he easily lifted me and dumped my protesting body in the lake. I splashed back to the surface spraying water in his direction. My hand shot out trying to grab him by the ankle to drag him in with me but he was faster. We were both laughing as I failed to get him into the lake. I rushed over to the beach stepping on sharp shells of freshwater mussels that came back with the current every night.  My wet feet slipped along the dock towards him. I grabbed Jason around the waist but I was again, tossed into the lake. 

We repeated that for a few minutes until we both were tired. I doubted we would catch any fish after all the action by the dock. He picked up a fishing rod to bait the hook. I watched him and then made him do the same for mine. He called me a baby for not wanting to touch the worms. They’re just gross. That’s all there was to it.   

There wasn’t much else to do besides relax in the sun feeling the cool breeze coming off the lake. I had brought my old Gameboy with a Zelda game to try and beat later. When we were younger, I always brought the same game with me every time we came to the lake. To this day I haven’t beaten it. I hoped with an adult brain I could finally see it to the end.  

“What have you been doing these past few years? Any kids on the way?” I asked Jason while we sat in lawn chairs watching the ripples across the water.  

I saw his face turn sour for a moment. Brooke never wanted children. She always knew that. But Jason was a good church boy who wanted a big family. The fact he didn’t have one yet must have been a sore spot that I just poked at.  

“We’re working on it. You know how it is.”  

I didn’t but I nodded being smart enough to not respond.  

“What about you? Dating anyone?”  

I shook my head feeling a batch of sweat start at the base of my neck. I wanted to avoid the subject of my dating history on this trip. I suppose when you get older you have fewer things to talk about aside from your job or who your partner is.  

“Still looking. You know how it is.” I added with a smile repeating his words. 

He let it slide which was a relief. To my surprise, we did catch something. A flat unappealing fish bit his line and Jason easily reeled it in. We tossed it back barely looking at it. Shortly after I hook a long and fat victim that would be perfect for that night's dinner. He removed the hook for me. The fish met my gaze and I swear it was silently begging me to spare its life as it gasped for air.   

“It’s kinda cute...” I told him hoping my friend got the hint.   

He rolled his eyes and sighed. Carefully he set the fish back into the lake and let it swim off to freedom.   

“We have enough food for the weekend. And I don’t feel like being the one to clean it. I know you wouldn’t.”  

I let out a smug laugh agreeing with him. He often did the dirty jobs I didn’t feel like and we both knew it.  We had meant to help with dinner but Brooke already got it started by the time we gave up fishing. Cooking was her favorite thing so I didn’t feel bad not doing more to help. She was the motherly type so I always wondered why she never decided to have kids. 

The cabin was large but only had a few rooms. A bedroom off the side had been claimed by Brooke and Erwin. The bathroom was about the same size as the bedroom next to it. We all took turns using the shower after dinner to wash away the smell of the lake.   

I walked out into the large living room before I had fully put on my shirt. Jason had been waiting by the door to use the washroom next. He caught a glimpse of a tattoo on my side. He grabbed my shirt and lifted it to get a better look at the three-inch pink Care Bear he had never seen on me before. I had worn a shirt while swimming and silently swore to myself because he saw my shame so soon.  

“How drunk were you when you got this?” He commented eyebrows raised.  

Erwin was nose deep in a book but Brooke looked over at us with a nervous expression. She knew something I had been hiding from Jason for a while.   

“I lost a bet. Needed to man up and get it. I haven’t been able to afford to get it removed.” I lied.  

He accepted the answer and moved on. Once the bathroom door was closed, Brooke and I sighed. Jason didn’t need to know I actually got a matching tattoo with my boyfriend at the time. It was a dumb choice and he would mock me for it. But he also hadn’t been very accepting in the past. Since I never came out and told him my dating preferences, I wasn’t entirely certain how he would react. Brooke had been pressuring me to just tell him. It did feel wrong to keep such a big thing from him. I simply wasn’t ready for that talk with my oldest friend just yet.  

There was enough room for us to gather around a table in the living room. The plan was to play a board game. It soon devolved into chatting and retelling old stories. I had thought Erwin would be bored listening to us talk for so long. Rather he was very interested in asking questions here and there. The longer I spent with him the more I realized he was perfect for Brooke. I was glad that they found each other.   

Finally, the pair decided to turn in for the night a little after one AM. Jason took the loft up the steep stairs and that left me with the couch by the fireplace. It was still too warm to light it at night. The lights went off casting the cabin in a deep darkness. You never realize just how bright the city is at night when you’re away from it. We all called out one final goodnight.   

I considered playing the Zelda game for a little bit but decided against it. I had all weekend for that. It was quiet and perfect for easily drifting off. I fell asleep quickly. It felt like I had only been out for a minute when a noise caused my body to jolt. It was a loud rumble sounding like thunder that shook the entire cabin. The digital clock nearby said three AM.   

I was going to fall back asleep but I heard Jason whisper over to me from the loft.  

“Did you hear that bang?” His low voice came from the dark.  

My eyes adjusted and I realized it was brighter in the cabin. The sun hadn't started to rise yet. Glancing outside I spotted a strange orange glow in the sky. My brain worked slowly. There wasn’t a forest fire outside, right? Jason noticed the odd sky and started down the stairs at the same time Brooke came out of the bedroom. Erwin soon followed behind fiddling with his glasses.   

“Do you think it’s a storm?” I asked now that everyone was awake. I didn’t want to consider anything worse than that.  

A chill came through the air causing me to pull the blanket around my shoulders. Brooke felt the cold as well. Erwin held her, rubbing her arms to calm both of them down. Jason briskly covered the distance to the front door. I got up to get behind him to see over his shoulder outside. What greeted us was something that took a few seconds to process.  

It was snowing.   

Not just some minor snow but a blizzard appeared out of nowhere. A gust of freezing cold air blasted through the cabin instantly chilling us all to the bone. Jason slammed the door shut, confusion clear across his face.  

“I’ll get a fire started.” Erwin offered.  

“Don’t bother. Everyone bundle up and get your keys.” Jason told us.  

We needed to get the hell out of here before we got snowed in. There wasn’t enough food or water for us to stay here for long. I’ve never seen snow so early in the year let alone so much of it at once.  

None of us brought jackets or even sweaters. Our heaviest clothing was the PJs we already wore. I dug up some sweaters thankfully left behind by my grandparents. I found some shoes for Brooke because she only brought sandals on the trip. We also wrapped blankets around us for extra warmth. I told everyone to hold hands in a line when we walked outside. After a few seconds of bracing for the cold, Jason opened the door again.  

Could we even drive in this? I suppose moving slowly out of the woods would be better than getting stranded inside the cabin.  

The harsh wind took our breaths away. Snow and ice pelted our faces as we struggled against the weather. I needed to shut my eyes against the cold. When I opened them again I glanced around confused.  

We had been walking away from the left of the cabin near the cars. When I closed my eyes the cabin had been behind us. When I opened then it was coming up in front of us. I knew it wasn’t a different cabin. None along this road looked like the one my grandparents own.   

Our group stood in front of the cabin glancing at each other silently asking how we got turned around.  

“Stay here.” Jason said.  

I protested against him jogging away, hir form then got swallowed up by the blizzard. Something slammed into my back making me look over my shoulder to a very scared Jason. He had been in front of me. How did he get behind us?  

Without another word, he darted towards the cabin aiming to run into the forest behind it. Again, he disappeared into the storm then a second later ran into me from the opposite direction he started in.  

What the fuck is going on?” He yelled trying to be heard over the wind.  

I half paid attention to his words. For the first time, I looked off in the direction of the lake. My eyes were the first to see the unnatural sight somewhat visible in the blistering snow.  

It was a dark shape that reached far into the sky. This thing had not been there before. Deep down I prayed my eyes were just playing tricks on me. The dark shape started to move, twisting slowly as if it realized I was watching it.  

All my other senses disappeared. I didn’t feel the cold. I didn’t hear any voices or a set of hands trying to get my attention. All I could focus on was that shape. No, countless shapes all moving into each other flicking countless colors. Bursts of purples and greens bounced across the sky, polluting it. A primal fear seeped into my chest. I would have lost myself in that moment if Jason didn’t slap my face hard enough to snap me from my trace.  

All the cold came at once. My legs collapsed from under me. All my strength was suddenly gone causing Jason and Erwin to drag me back inside the cabin.   

They got me on the couch and then started to strip away the freezing cold and damp clothing. My body shook so hard it hurt. My mind swam with questions as well as sheer terror.  

“Did you hear it?” Jason asked pausing in his task.  

“Hear what?” I replied through chattering teeth.  

His eyes studied me for a while. He dropped the matter. Erwin found dry blankets to cocoon my body in. I wanted to have a hot shower but also didn’t want to get up off the couch. Soon Brooke came over with hot tea for everyone. We sat in silence listening to the storm outside sipping our hot drinks not wanting to talk about what just happened.  

Finally, Jason broke.  

“Does anyone have a working phone?”  

We had been too scared to think clearly. Everyone checked their phones to find them all dead. The power had gone out when we entered the cabin. The fireplace and wood stove gave us a reliable source of light and heat.  My grandparents stocked the place with a ton of firewood. We would be fine on that front. But they didn’t leave us a radio or a way to contact someone in an emergency.  

“What are we going to do?” Erwin asked in a soft voice.  

None of us wanted to say it. There was nothing we could do. No way to contact anyone. No way to get away from the cabin. And no way to know what was towering off in the middle of the lake, watching us.  

“We wait out the storm.” Jason nodded.  

The wind shook the cabin. I doubted his plan however we didn’t have any other ideas. No one brought up our low food supplies. Instead, I got out my Gameboy and asked who wanted to help me play the game.  

I suppose we should have been doing something, anything else. We all felt so hopeless at that moment. Huddled together taking turns looking at a small screen was oddly comforting. Erwin helped out a lot by writing down quest goals and what we might have to do next. We were all exhausted by the time we got to near the end of the game. To our dismay, the batteries died just before the last battle. We took turns trying to find new batteries around the cabin. No luck. An odd feeling came over me when I considered I may never see the ending of the game in my lifetime.  

It was well past when the sun should have come out. The sky remained dark with the storm raging outside. After the Gameboy died Erwin suggested that we should get some sleep. I doubted anyone could rest after such a rough night. We didn’t want to be apart from each other. Each of us gathered all the blankets, sheets, and pillows in the cabin to pile them in the living room by the couch. We let Brooke take the couch and the guys stayed on the floor. The fireplace kept the cabin warm. However, it was not comforting.   

I somehow slept for an hour or so being tormented by half-remembered nightmares. Jason got up first. He started silently pacing, a strained expression on his face. His hand was near his neck holding a small gold cross he received from his mother. I couldn’t imagine how this was affecting him.   

Brooke got up and worked in the kitchen. She took stock of our food, writing down portions and meal ideas. Erwin appeared the most stressed out of all of us. He kept picking up the same book, reading a page, and setting it aside.  

None of us wanted to talk about what we saw outside. It felt as if the words came out it would make it real. If we ignored it, we would be fine.  

I had nothing else to do but keep the fire going. Without power, it was hard to tell the time. We could have spent hours in silence.   

“Maybe... I should try for the cars again.” Jason said finally breaking the mood.  

“No!”  

Brooke and I shouted at him at the same time. Jason flinched at our voices. He frowned not agreeing with our reply but accepting it. I didn’t think Brooke saw the same thing I had outside in the lake. Regardless, she knew something was out there and scared to death by it. 

“People are expecting us back by the end of the weekend. We can wait out the storm until they come and get us.” She said without her voice holding as much confidence as she would have wanted.  

Jason turned his head deciding not to start a fight. He doubted anyone would come to find us. I knew he would wait for at least another day before trying to brave the storm once more. Somehow, I also knew if any of us left the cabin, we weren’t coming back. I just wasn’t aware of just who we would lose in the coming days.  

Brooke made us a hot meal being careful to ration the supplies by watering down the pasta sauce. We didn’t mind. Since things had calmed down a little, we didn’t sleep all in one spot like the night before. Brooke and Erwin went to the bedroom and Jason retreated up to the loft when we decided to turn in after doing nothing all day.  

Brooke wanted to be comforted by her husband alone. Throughout the next few hours, I heard them softly talking in the other room, then just his voice whispering to her.   

The sky outside didn’t darken. Different shades slowly came across through the blizzard. For a few hours, it had turned orange. It gave enough light to read by. I borrowed one of the books Erwin brought along. He had a mixture of everything. Military dramas to vampire romance. Maybe the vampire book belonged to Brooke. I fell asleep again on the couch with the fireplace keeping the chill of the storm at bay.  

I woke up feeling cold noticing how low the fire had gotten. Jason was making his way down the loft steps. I apologized then got up to get the fire going again. Someone needed to go outside to get more wood soon. I dreaded the idea of it. And yet I thought just going next to the cabin may be safe enough.  

Brooke left the bedroom and hung out with me all day. I’m unsure of what Jason did. He appeared tired. Aside from helping with the fire a few times he stayed in the loft resting. Erwin also stayed in the bedroom. I was glad Brooke felt well enough to sit and talk with me for a while. We had already said the same stories a few times that weekend. I never realized how fast you ran out of new things to talk about with older friends because they had been with you during all the interesting events in your life.  

At dinner time Jason came down from the loft. The three of us were gathered around the table setting it up. The bedroom door opened and I raised my head to greet Erwin after not seeing him for a few hours. The words died in my throat when I saw his haunted expression. There was simply something just not right going on with him.   

I started walking around the table my feet feeling oddly heavy.   

“Do you hear it? I need to go...” He muttered mostly to himself.  

I shouted at him to stop. His thin short legs burst into a run. Within seconds he was out the door with Jason at his heels. I would have followed. Brooke came rushing crying for her husband to come back. I grabbed a hold of her to keep her inside the cabin and in the warmth.  

It felt like days that they were missing but was really only an hour. The waiting killed us. We kept the door open with snow blowing inside. No matter how cold it got we refused to lock our loved ones outside. A dark shape came through the blizzard. My heart jumped into my throat as a strange fear had a stranglehold over my chest.  

Jason collapsed inside, his body shaking from the cold and his lips blue. Brooke took his left side and I grabbed his right. We dragged him inside to get him in front of the fire. I started to strip off his cold soaked clothing to wrap him in warm blankets. Brooke walked over to the door. With some hesitation, she gently closed it accepting the fact her husband wasn’t coming back.  

“Get him in the shower after he’s warmed up a little.” She told me. “I’ll put away the food. We’ll need it if we’ll be here for a while.”  

I listened to her orders. She needed to stay busy, to not think of what just happened. None of us had tried to have a hot shower since the first night. To my dismay, the water wasn’t warming up.  

Brooke and I worked away with boiling snow from outside and filling the tub. Jason hadn’t woken up. That worried me. Once the tub was full enough, I carefully tapped his cheek. He stirred enough to show he was alive. After a while, he recovered enough to sit up. Using my shoulder, I got him into the bathroom. Carefully he lowered himself in the tub eyes closed appearing utterly exhausted. 

I turned to leave. His hand found my wrist carefully bringing me closer. I nodded and sat next to the tub with my back facing him.  

“I couldn’t find him.” He said his voice sounding strained.  

“It’s ok...” I said unsure of what else to say.  

“None of this is ok.” He snapped; voice hoarse.  

Jason needed to take his anger out on someone. I let it be me. He sighed and sank back down into the water. 

“Did you hear whatever Erwin did before he left?” Jason asked sounding a bit better than before.  

“No.” I glanced over my shoulder studying his face.  

He didn’t appear surprised. Neither of us elaborated on the question out of fear over what the answers may bring. 

Jason soon got dressed. When we went into the living room area, we got worried we didn’t see Brooke. Before panicking we headed into the bedroom finding her standing in the middle of the room, studying the walls.  

Erwin had drawn countless symbols across the walls and floors when he was alone. None of us could make sense of a single word. I gently guided Brooke out of there sitting her on the couch. She appeared distant. No one would blame her for not being able to deal with all of this.   

I went back into the room with Jason. Our heads scanned the odd words trying to make sense of any of them.  

“Erwin was pretty smart.” I commented figuring all of this was a language he knew and we didn’t.  

“Was?” Jason asked turning his head away from the writing.  

“I didn’t mean it like that...” I trailed off.  

Even if we didn’t say it out loud, we all knew Erwin wasn’t coming back. Just like we knew something was in the lake causing this storm.  

None of us felt like eating no matter how much our stomachs rumbled. We also didn’t want to sleep. It was impossible to know when it was night now. At the moment, there wasn’t much else to do but rest and worry.  

Brooke couldn’t be in the bedroom and it gave me the creeps. She also said she wanted to be alone for a bit. That left Jason and I to share the loft. It had two beds so it wasn’t a problem. I carried extra blankets up the wooden stairs along with a book or two silently thanking Erwin for bringing them. 

I’d gotten comfortable when a noise made my head turn. To my shock, Jason dragged the side table between the two beds away and then started to push the second bed against mine.  

“What are you doing?” I asked utterly confused.  

“It’s colder up here.” He said as if that was an answer.  

“I’ll be fine.” I protested.  

“I won’t. I’m freezing my balls off.”  

He got the two beds snug and piled the blankets next to me. His body collapsed in bed, our sides touching. It was warmer but embarrassing. He picked up one of the books to start reading. His eyes drifted to the window watching the storm more than looking at the book. 

“How do you think Tiff is doing?” I said out of the blue.  

Tiff was a good friend of ours. Then she came out as trans. Jason cut contact with her, just utterly refused to acknowledge she was ever a part of our friend group. Soon afterwards she moved away and I lost contact.  

“I dunno. I guess fine. I heard she had a crappy uncle and it broke apart her family. Why do you ask?”  

I stared at him unable to hide my stunned expression. Did I have the wrong idea about him all these years? He called Tiff she. Something I never expected of him.  

“Uh, this book has a trans character. It made me think of her.” I lied.  

He raised an eyebrow staring at the faded crime book in my hands doubting my excuse. He dropped it either not caring or accepting my lie. After a while, I closed my book wanting to try and sleep. A small rumbling came from outside. I gripped the blankets hard as my stomach twisted in fear. I found myself thinking what was outside would take me like it did Erwin. My mind made up terrifying fates for the poor man I barely knew.  

Jason sat up reaching around to the back of his neck. Carefully he took off the small gold chain. Leaning over he tried to get it around my neck. Swiftly my hand came up blocking him.  

“That’s too important to you.” I refuse.  

“You’re more important to me.” His voice sounded low and so soft compared to the person I knew him as.  

My heart nearly stopped in my chest. This didn’t feel real. I could accept whatever horror was out in the lake before my oldest friend said that kind of thing to me.  

“Are you scared?” He asked still sounding so gentle.  

A rush of emotions I’d been trying to hold back came rushing to the forefront. I hated myself for nodding and even more for letting him hold me as I quietly sobbed into his shoulder. I shouldn’t be accepting his kindness when I hadn’t lost what Brooke had. And yet I did. After my brief spell of grief, I let him put the cross around my neck with a promise I would return it later. I let him keep an arm wrapped around my shoulders as he finally fell asleep. I didn’t know if he needed someone next to him to relax enough to get some rest. The storm raged on a constant reminder of how trapped we were.  

Time started to have no meaning. We could only tell it was passing based on our food supply going down. Meals got smaller and smaller no matter how hard Brooke tried. It was well passed the weekend limit. No one had come looking for us, or at least, no one had found us.   

All that time Brooke never mentioned Erwin. We didn’t dare to bring him up to her. We played a board game or two trying our best to take our minds off the isolation. There were three of us and yet I’ve never felt so alone. I started to call the hours between going up to the loft to rest days regardless of how much time passed by.  

We would get up, do nothing but read, have a small meal then sleep for longer than we had been awake.  

It was two days after our last meal when I finally gave up. There were spices and condiments left in the cabin. None of us had gotten desperate enough to start eating ketchup packets and yet soon it might happen.   

I opened my eyes and thought about getting out of bed. It didn’t happen. While awake I found myself staring at the ceiling thinking about the same horrible thoughts that tormented me since the storm started. Hours passed by and Jason noticed I hadn’t gotten up. He had been playing cards with Brooke for the day. She started to get tired easily. I saw dark bags form under her eyes no matter how much she slept. She crashed on the couch and he retreated upstairs.  

The fire didn’t fully warm the loft. The cold nipped at my face and toes unless a person was next to me.  

“Brooke is asleep.” He whispered right next to me.  

My eyes opened again and I barely had the motivation to look over at him.  

“She’ll be out for a while.” He added. 

I nodded unable to respond. I wanted to just rot away in that bed. What he did next caused a rush of energy to come through my muscles. His hand slipped around my waist, his face getting closer to mine. Again, I lifted my hands to block the advances.  

“Whoa, there buddy. That’s a sin.” I weakly joked.  

A long-time joke of ours was me commenting on his sinful behavior regardless if it was or not. A smile appeared on his face making my chest feel warm. I wanted to see that smile for so long and I hated how it made me feel.  

“Do you think any of that matters with that... thing outside?” His voice sounded playful and it scared me.  

The wind blew harder at the windows for a moment as if it heard him speak. My mouth became dry my brain coming up blank.  

“Haven’t you always liked me? If I’m wrong about that, I’ll stop.”  

Again, it felt like my heart would stop because of his words. He was right. God damn it he was. I’ve always loved him even before I knew what those kinds of feelings were. All the people I dated had something that reminded me of him. And yet, I respect him enough to never let him know.  

But who cared now? My hands lowered letting him close the distance. After so long of being scared and cold I just wanted some warmth, no matter what kind of awful person that turned me into.  

I had hoped after connecting with a person I’d cared about for so long would make this terrible situation better. A fever crept up. I wanted to get out of bed and yet I felt too weak to raise my head. It could have been as long as three days that I was confined to the bed upstairs only drinking hot water Jason brought up.  

The finally fever dropped enough for me to move around a little. The smell of meal filled the cabin when I opened my eyes again. Jason had been resting next to me. I shook him awake. The days inside the cabin had taken a toll on him. He’s lost weight and his eyes appear sunken. Yet, he still smiled when he saw I felt better. Then a frown came over his face. We ran out of food a while ago. What was Brooke cooking?  

He helped me down the steps. Soon it was clear we wouldn’t have the strength to go back up there and would need to bring down all the important items before that happened.  

My head was light and my eyesight was blurry from lack of nutrition. It took me a minute to focus on Brooke stirring a pot on the wood-fueled stove.  

My stomach sank to the floor with my legs soon following.   

“Hey, sweethearts. Sorry, I took so long. I made something for you.”  

She turned, face pale and clothing hanging from her now thinner frame. Blood stained her left side as well as the wooden floor. A now empty sleeve dangled down.  I found myself falling backwards and hard on the floor unable to deal with the gruesome sight. I didn’t see what was inside the pot, but I knew. Oh God, why didn’t we just go outside the cabin instead of letting it get this far?  

I don’t know how, but Jason got me back into the bed in the loft. I prayed I wouldn’t wake up again after that sight but I did. 

“Is she...?” I asked voice cracking.  

“I’ll keep an eye on her.” He told me and made sure I was comfortable.  

His face looked better. How long had I been out for? What happened while I was passed out?   

“You should eat something. It’s what Brooke wants.” He spoke as if he was talking to a child.  

I shook my head stomach churning in stress and hunger.  

“Let me die here.” I begged too tired to even cry.  

His hands carefully were placed on my cheeks so he could get his point across.  

“I’m not going to let that happen. I gave up everything I believed in for you. It can’t all be for nothing.”  

I flinched when he leaned over to press his lips over my own. If he was offended, he didn’t show it. I couldn’t face what was going on. Like a coward, I let myself fall asleep again hoping my dreams weren’t as bad as reality.   

Rumbling of the storm shook the cabin. Somehow, I had enough strength to sit up. I now had a goal. To get outside no matter what that thing did to me.  

Step by step I crept down the steep wooden stairs. Jason wasn’t in the loft and I didn’t see him or Brooke in the living room. On shaking legs, I carefully walked away from the stairs to look into the dimly lit kitchen area. Awful wet chewing sounds came from behind the dinner table. I didn’t see Brooke, just a dark shape hunched over eating something on the floor just out of sight.  

“Jason...?” I didn’t recognize my fearful voice.  

His head shot up; white shining eyes stared through the darkness. It suddenly grew completely silent. The storm outside that had trapped us finally stopped. The sky still appeared dark.  

I turned in my heels and bolted with him scrambling on all fours behind. My hand reached the handle before he grabbed my shirt. What I opened the door to wasn’t a snow-covered lake.   

That... Thing. That countless massive twisting shapes had pressed itself right against the cabin door. I stared directly into it. The mind-bending colors and strange emotions ripped through my brain all at once. Limbs like shadowy arms reached out so close and yet they appeared a million miles away all at once. A mad cackling laughter started and I faintly became aware it was mine.  

Strength came through me. I felt like I could run forever. Live forever. Become something else forever. My hand reached out trying to accept the offer.  

The door slammed shut and I was dragged to the ground. I thrashed trying to get free. Screaming to follow into that other existence. Anything to no longer be myself. Jason gripped my shoulders painfully with large clawed hands. He had changed, His eyes glowed with a white light inside dark voids. A large set of teeth threatened to rip apart my flesh. He didn’t look like the person I knew and yet, there was traces of the human he had been hiding underneath those monstrous features.  

Darkness spread into what felt like my soul. It threatened to overtake my mind no matter how hard I fought against it. Jason should just eat me and be done with it. Death was a far more comforting outcome than accepting whatever that thing wanted me to become.  

The glitter of the cross necklace caught his eyes. A more human expression came over his face. Fear pain tore through every fiber of my body. I wanted it all to end one way or another.  

“I’ll take it all for you.” His voice sounded raspy.  

I shook my head knowing if it took my burdens there was no coming back. He may be part monster now, but he could leave this cabin with some humanity left. The thing outside didn’t want him.  

My protests didn’t last long. Instead of sharp ripping teeth, he held us in a tight embrace. There was another way out of all of this. In the end, I accepted his offer and took a coward's way out. After being so cold for so long I didn’t think I would ever feel such heat again.  

The thing outside screamed knowing it failed to take its victim. The noise shook the world causing everything to fade once more.  

I woke up in a hospital bed, my head swimming. Slowly I recovered and was told what happened. A horrible storm ripped through the area and a small tornado destroyed several cabins including the ones we were staying in. The bodies of Brooke, Erwin, and Jason were never found, all assumed to be dead. Over eleven people disappeared in that storm. Whispers rippled through the community over how there had never been a storm that bad let alone a tornado. I refuse to believe it all. I know what happened to us. We were taken away by something no humans can ever understand. After all, no one could explain why I had lost so much weight in the three days it took to find me in the wreckage of the cabin.  

I still carry the memories and scars from that place. As well as the golden cross gifted to my best friend I made the mistake of falling in love with.  

He... changed. Jason isn’t human, nor is he something that that monster wanted him to be. He’s stuck as something in-between. I don’t know where he ended up. I refuse to believe he died in that storm. I need to find him again and somehow make things right. At the very least, he should have someone keeping him warm again.  

When my body recovers, I’ll be going back to the area to help with the cleanup effort. Also to look for a person who saved my life by taking all my burdens.
