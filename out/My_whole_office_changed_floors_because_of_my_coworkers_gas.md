It began with a fart.  
  
My next-door cubicle neighbor, Michael with the missing tooth, (or big Mike as we called him in the breakroom), felt comfortable enough this past Tuesday to let one rip while I was clacking away at a work email.

It wasn't a surprising fart, just a noticeable one. Clearly not loud enough to rattle the particle board with memos, my calendar, and a photo of my dog pinned to it, but still quite a sound to be heard half an hour before lunch in the middle of a busy office.

I understand that despite the professional standard we're held to here at Osman Bio-Corp. (OBC), we're all only human and sometimes, humans pass gas. I decided to let Mike do his thing, and get back to methodically replying and deleting my way through my inbox.

Halfway through typing a not-so-nice, yet irredeemably polite email to the Logistics Coordinator about the failed refrigeration on our last two shipments, Mike let loose again. This time it was a little more sonically poignant, I glanced at the wall separating us, and as if detecting my awareness of the fart, Mike let a little dry cough out. I shook my head, put on my headphones, and tried my best to ignore Big Mike and his interruptions.

After hitting send a few more times on some emails, it hit me: a sour, sulfuric stench, so strong and appalling, that it was **my** turn to cough. I tried my best to bury my nose into the crook of my arm, and wait for it to subside, gasping for any wisp of air filtered through my shirt sleeve. The smell was so powerful, it was like seeing the heat off of a highway in the summer, but above my keyboard instead. I had thought the days of rank, putrid farts were behind me, left in the late-night, drunk chili-dog air of my college dorm room, years ago. But the air I was unfortunately breathing then, took the chocolate cake.

After a few excruciating minutes, the smell either subsided or I (in horror) had accommodated to it, and before I knew it, the clock hit 1:00 on my screen, and I leapt out of my chair for lunch.   
  
Realizing this was the moment I usually spared a smile and a quick chat with Mike on my way to the break room, I decided instead to not look him in the eye, and grabbed my things and headed passed the elevators towards the breakroom, leaving our gas chambers and Mike behind. He deserved the illusion that no one had witnessed such embarrassment all morning. 

At lunch, I barely ate, realizing in perfect, odorous hindsight, that an egg salad sandwich was the worst possible choice to pack after the morning I've had. I took a couple courageous bites, but set it down, the smell setting off my gag reflex. I dumped it in the trash and sat, browsing Reddit on my phone. Soon, it was time to clock back in and I took a few quick breaths of cafeteria air before marching back to my corner of Hell.

After a few minutes back in my chair, the smell from Big Mike still faintly lingering (I wondered if it was in my clothes now), I realized I couldn't hear Mike typing at his desk. I decided not to look over the cubicle wall, and do my best to ignore the chemical warfare I had been subjected to earlier.

As my eyes met my inbox yet again, there was an email at the top of the list. With mental alarm bells ringing, I saw it was from Mr. Roper, the department head. With my luck, of course, it was a call to arms for overtime, and I realized my Friday evening would be spent in this creaky chair at this glowing screen. I had a lot of data filing to do, and Mr. Roper and I got along well enough that I didn't want the look of ignoring an urgent email like this, despite a looming weekend.

So away I went, clicking from application to application, keystrokes flying from my fingertips like lasers. I locked in, doing my best to quell the tide of time keeping me there late, while still showing what a value I was to OBC. 

I hardly noticed when half the fluorescent lights dimmed, signaling the departure of the office workers and the arrival of the broom-pushers, but I continued, knowing my work here would soon be done, and a more fun screen and a couple of cold oat sodas were awaiting me back at my apartment. 

Coming to an unusual problem with my inputs, I paused and my mind drifted. I thought of inane things and remembered this morning and Mike. *He must've left by now,* I thought to myself. I was the only one in the department, despite Mike's personal ties with OBC, who really enjoyed Mr. Roper's leash, and did my best to please when I could. Promotions, and all that...

I slid an ear off my headphones, and listened. Mike must have left after lunch, since I still didn't hear any sign of him from his desk. As I went to slip my ear back, I heard the most faint guttural outburst from the cubicle next to me. Another fart. This time, it sounded further away, almost like it was outside. But since the windows don't open on the first floor, and Mike's cubicle is in the corner, there's no mistaking where the sound must've came from. I thought about this for a moment, wondering how Mike could stay so still and silent for hours as the smell hit me again, this time more faint, yet still as pungent.

 I chalked it up to maybe the air conditioning moving the smell around, and maybe Mike had left a jacket or his lunchbox and I was smelling something residual from that. Besides, just a few more pages of input and I'd be home free.

An hour later, the cleaners had left (doing a half-ass job ass I didn't even see any of them) and I believed myself to be the only one left in the building. My eyes were beginning to really dry out now, from the lack of overhead light and the blaring whiteness of office software with no dark-mode programmed in.

As the album I was listening to ended, I sat in a muffled silence for a moment while I scrolled on my phone to find something else to listen to as I finished the night out. That's when I heard something, a soft voice. I jerked my headphones off and craned my ears. *Were the cleaners still in the building?*

*"Help mee..."*

It was coming from the cubicle next to me and with it, a fresh wave of that disgusting odor.

I slowly pushed my chair back and stood up, the smell amplifying at my new height. Now my eyes were watering.

With a kind of rising panic in my gut, I peered over the cubicle wall.

As my vision panned down, over pictures of Mike and the Osman family in boats holding fish and grinning, Mike with his absent front tooth, and a framed photo of a cabin, I saw Mike's chair. Or rather, what was left of it.

The back of the chair stood precariously on the remaining legs. Where the seat was, was a steaming void. I looked completely over and saw that where Mike was usually sitting, there was now a Mike-sized hole in the floor. To my horror, it looked deep. 

The smell was a real assault by then, choking me badly. With one last glance, I glimpsed the entire hole, and if I had breath, I would've screamed.

In the steaming, dark tunnel below Mike's cubicle, barely lit by the overhead fluorescents, I saw what could only be described as a face with bright white eyes. As it opened it's warped mouth, the last thing I saw was a missing tooth.

I spun around, grabbed my bag, and booked it.

*"Help mee..."*

A shrill, terrible noise lodged itself in the back of my throat as I hurried to my car in a full panic. I drove home faster than usual, and made sure the door was locked, twice. I paced, not taking note of my excited dog, happy I was home. I did nothing but stare at carpet and walk back and forth till I was sure the sun was rising and I had worn a path in the floor. 

I couldn't make sense of any of it. At times, I nearly broke down crying that weekend at what I had saw, it took me back to a primordial sense of fear, the kind you have as a child, racing up the basement stairs after turning off the light. I didn't use the bathroom all weekend, I couldn't imagine the smell of me taking a shit after that Friday. I avoided looking at my garbage disposal and trash chute. I didn't shower once, the drain was too intimidating. 

By the time I was sure my hair was beginning to thin from the stress, it was Monday. I had been weighing the options of never returning to OBC, the option of getting on a flight back home to Wisconsin. But, the thought of all the questions I would get for uprooting my life and leaving a promising career in Genetic Data behind, kept my feet moving down the stairs and to my car Monday morning.

When I swiped my keycard at the entrance of OBC, I was stunned to see Mr. Roper himself standing in the lobby.

"Hey, great work on Friday! I really, really appreciate what you did for the department. Just really grateful."

Before I could open my mouth to speak, he cut me off.

"So heads up, we're doing some renovating, something about a Radon leak on the first floor... construction will take a while, so the department has been moved upstairs. Hey, the windows are bigger, we could all use some more sun this Spring!" he chuckled in a corporate way.

My brain was frozen, before I could reply, he turned and swiped his own keycard to let me into the office.

On auto-pilot, I walked down the hallway. When I reached the junction for our department, I saw a few guys with ladders working on drywall and plaster. They must've started on the weekend because the hallway was now nearly finished extending around the bend, sealing off the first floor of cubicles. 

As I passed the last unfinished section, my willpower failed me and I glanced into the office. It was spookily dark. The windows had all been walled over.

I got in the elevator, and pushed "two". I had a passing memory of the only time I had been on the second floor when I first started and got a tour. Of course, the first and second floors were the only ones I could see. The remaining thirty two were off limits.

Michelle was waiting at a reception desk when I stepped off the elevator.

"Hey, welcome! Don't worry we kept the layout pretty much the same, you're still in the corner." she smiled at me.

"Hey, have you seen Mik-"

"Right this way!" she said pleasantly, walking away before I could finish. 

She led me to my new desk and I noticed that now I was in the corner, with no one next to me. It's like the space where Big Mike's cubicle was on the floor plan ceased to exist.

I sat there for awhile, my screen dark, my computer off, my desk unusually empty, and my cubicle walls bare. After a while, I thought: *I'll need to get a new photo of my dog*.



The week went by quick, I got a lot of really chummy emails and thanks for my extra work. It seemed like they really wanted to butter me up, yet I got lost in the praise and in my work.

I didn't think it'd be easy to block out what I saw that evening in Mike's cubicle, but after just a few days, I was just peachy. I would've just let things be if it weren't for a few minutes ago.

You see, my constipation from last weekend finally gave out, and I'm in the employee restroom on my phone.

I'm shaking, not from any physical exertion, but because I just heard a voice from the floor drain at my feet.

*"Help mee..."*
