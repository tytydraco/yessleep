I started this job two months ago, and things have been getting a little weird out here.

It was a seasonal appointment. The kind of position that exists mostly on paper and gets filled by people who need something quiet to bridge the gap between whatever came before and whatever is supposed to come next.

The posting said Winter Road Gate Monitor. It said housing provided. It said minimal public contact. Both of those were listed like warnings, but they felt like benefits to me. I prefer being alone. People are a lot sometimes, and I’ve always done better at the edges of things. When I saw the listing, I was actually a little excited.

There’s one access road that cuts through this section of forest, way up north. Six feet of snow isn’t unusual here. In summer, the road leads to trailheads and old pull-offs people use for fishing or picnics. In winter, it leads nowhere that matters. Snow makes sure of that. Ice finishes the job.

When I started, they issued me six keys, three gates, a cabin, a storage shed, and a very old snowmobile I use to check the outer closures. The road closes every year.

Someone has to stay.

That someone is me.

Vanessa.

I’m not completely alone. A food delivery guy named Dave comes every seven to nine days, depending on snowfall. He’s not too bad. Chats a little. Sometimes too much. I’m not great at small talk, but I don’t mind him. I think he either likes me or feels sorry for me. Either way, I’m grateful.

Officially, I’m responsible for monitoring the closure. That’s the wording they use. Monitoring. Not guarding. Not enforcing. Just making sure the gates are closed, intact, and logged. There’s shoveling, fuel checks, clearing ice from hinges. That’s about it.

I didn’t think the gate would be the thing that bothered me.

They’re standard forest service gates, spaced about a mile apart along the road. Steel bars, chipped green paint, reflective markers that only work if you’re already too close. Each one has a sign bolted on that reads SEASONAL CLOSURE – NO WINTER ACCESS, with a smaller notice underneath reminding people they can be fined if they ignore it.

The signs are newer than the gates.

The bolts don’t match.

None of them match.

Different sizes. Different heads. Some stripped, some shiny. It shouldn’t bother me, but it does. I swear whoever installed them just grabbed whatever was closest and called it a day. Ladies and gentlemen, the U.S. government.

I live on-site because the road isn’t reliably passable once the snow settles in. That’s what they told me. It sounded reasonable at the time.

They left some things out.

Like the noises. The wildlife.

And the footprints.

About four weeks ago, after the first major snowfall, I found them near Gate One.

Bare footprints.

Not boot prints. Not animal tracks. Bare feet. Clear impressions pressed into ice and nearly two and a half feet of snow, leading out of the woods toward the gate.

I reported it. I told the wardens I’d found tracks and made sure to be very clear about what kind. Someone, barefoot, walking across frozen ground.

I followed them for a short distance. I probably shouldn’t have, but I did.

They led to a large oak tree just off the road.

And then they stopped.

No return tracks. No disturbance. Just… gone.

Like whoever made them touched the tree and dropped out of existence.

I know how that sounds.

That’s why I’m writing this down instead of saying it out loud.

The cabin sits about fifty yards back from the road, just inside the tree line. You can’t see it unless you know where to look, which I like. It has heat, running water when the pipes cooperate, and a generator that sounds like it’s clearing its throat before it finally catches. Cell service is unreliable. I was advised not to depend on it. I don’t.

Books, candles, and alcohol have proven far more dependable.

Technically, I’m not supposed to have booze up here. I packed half my suitcase with cheap vodka anyway. Dave occasionally slips me a bottle of wine or a pack of seltzers when he delivers supplies. I don’t ask questions.

About a week after I found the footprints, Dave came by with a delivery.

He knocked loud enough to wake me up. I answered the door still half-asleep and hungover.

“Special delivery,” he said, grinning like he always does.

“Thanks, Dave,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

He lingered on the porch, looking past me.

“I noticed the snowman,” he said. “Very cute.”

I frowned. “What snowman?”

“The one right outside,” he said, shrugging. “Gotta kill time somehow, right?”

I told him to wait and shoved my feet into my boots.

The snowman was standing a few yards from the cabin. About four feet tall. Neatly packed. Coal eyes. A scarf I didn’t own.

It hadn’t been there the night before.

Dave swore he didn’t build it. I believed him but our footprints were the only ones in the snow, sooo.

I told myself it was early holiday cheer.

That felt like the most reasonable explanation.

The third thing happened yesterday.

It wasn’t outside.

It was in the logbook.

Every gate has one. Hardbound. Numbered pages. You’re supposed to write in pen, no corrections, no tearing pages out. Date, time, condition, signature. I’m careful with it. I always have been. Messy logs get flagged, and I don’t like being flagged.

Yesterday morning, when I opened it to log the overnight temperature, there was already an entry.

It was in my handwriting.

Same slant. Same habit of pressing too hard on downstrokes. Same way I loop my y’s when I’m tired.

The date was right. The time was wrong by a few minutes.

The entry said the gate was secure. That there had been no disturbances. That conditions were stable.

Under notes, it said: You’re making a big deal out of nothing.

I stared at it longer than I’m comfortable admitting.

I don’t write notes like that. Not here. Not ever.

I flipped back through earlier pages, heart was pounding.

There were more.

Short comments I didn’t remember writing. Phrases I hadn't heard in years. Things that didn’t belong in an official record.

You’re too sensitive.

This is why people don’t take you seriously.

If something was wrong, you’d know.

I could hear the voice as I read them.

I closed the book.

I locked it up.

I took the snow mobile home and proceeded to drink an entire bottle of vodka and I still remember it so that was super effective at helping.
