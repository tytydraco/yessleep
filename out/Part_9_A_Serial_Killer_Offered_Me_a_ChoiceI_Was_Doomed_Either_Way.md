It was strange. For the first time in days, I’d slept well—too well.

The title of Assistant Night Manager still felt alien, like a shirt that didn’t fit no matter how you adjusted it. When I woke, the weight in my pocket reminded me it wasn’t a dream. The dagger felt cold and foreign, as though it had a pulse of its own.

I arrived at 10 p.m., half an hour earlier than usual. I had to speak with the old man.

The moment I stepped through the doors, the store’s familiar chill wrapped around me, blurring the edges of yesterday like it had never happened. The old man was already at the reception desk, standing as if he’d been waiting for me.

“You passed,” he said with a smile.

It wasn’t a kind smile—it was a grin that didn’t belong on his face. In all my time here, I’d never seen him show any emotion let alone anything close to joy.

“Follow me.”

He moved fast, like he didn’t want us to linger in open space. We slipped into the employee office, and that’s when I saw it—the suit.

It was nearly identical to the Night Manager’s—tailored perfectly to my size, fine fabric catching the dim light. But the aura was wrong. Heavy. Familiar.

The same aura the Night Manager carried.

“Old man,” I said quietly, “tell me about the dagger.”

His eyes narrowed. “That dagger,” he whispered, “is the only thing that can kill the Night Manager.”

I opened my mouth, but he shook his head and stepped closer, so close I could smell the paper-dry scent of his breath.

“The store… keeps balance,” he said, the words like a confession. “The Night Manager wasn’t always what he is now. Three hundred eighty-five years ago, he came here as a teenager, chasing his dream of becoming a model. He had bright green eyes and an even brighter future. Came here for the paycheck. Thought he’d be gone in a month.”

His voice dropped, trembling now. “But this place doesn’t just hire people. It eats them. Turns them into their worst selves. After he killed the previous Night Manager, I thought—” the old man’s voice broke for a second, “—I thought he’d destroy this place and set us free.”

He shook his head. “But the hunger for power was stronger. He couldn’t control it. The spirits here… he bent them to his will. And he liked it.”

He fixed me with a stare that felt heavier than the dagger in my pocket.

“It’s your choice, Remi. Live under him as his right hand… or kill him. But know this—killing him makes you him. Most can’t fight it once they feel that power. They think they will. They swear they will. And once the store makes you a monster…”

He whispered so low that I almost didn't catch it.

“…you won’t burn it down. You’ll protect it.”

The old man stepped back, his face twisting into something I couldn’t place. Without a word, he slipped past me and vanished down the hall, moving like a shadow melting into the dark.

I ducked into the bathroom and changed into the suit. The moment I stepped out, a voice cut through the silence.

“Wow,” Dante said from the doorway, a crooked grin on his face. “That’s… intense. Didn’t know you could pull off funeral chic.”

“It’s not funny,” I muttered, smoothing the sleeve like I could stop the fabric from gripping me. “Feels like I’m wearing someone else’s skin.”

His smile faded a little. “Guess that’s one way to say you got promoted.”

I ignored that and instead recited the words from last night, the ones that had been gnawing at me:

“Time stands still where shadows meet,

Between the heart of store and heat.

The keeper’s pulse you seek to find,

Ticks softly, hidden just behind.”

Dante raised an eyebrow. “Poetry hour?”

“It’s not poetry—it’s where the Night Manager’s heart is. ‘Tick’ means clock. And if it’s in the center of the store… well, we already know where that is.”

The clock stood exactly where the main aisles crossed—tall, brass, and polished to a gleam no one ever maintained. We passed it every night without looking twice.

We circled it once. Nothing. Just a clock. No hidden panels, no strange vibrations, no ominous hum.

Dante frowned. “You sure about this?”

“Not yet,” I said, craning my neck to look up past the gleaming face. The second hand twitched forward with mechanical precision. Behind it, the inner gears clicked softly, steady and patient.

Somewhere above that… maybe there was something else. Something the spirits hadn’t told me.

The store’s overhead lights flickered. The sound system crackled.

Then the clock began to chime—deep and resonant. Eleven slow, deliberate strikes.

The first strike was just a sound. The second… I felt in my chest. By the third, the suit’s collar tightened slightly against my throat, like it was listening.

Dante glanced at me. “Shift’s starting.”

The clock finished its eleventh chime. And the store exhaled.

The shift had been… unnervingly calm. Dante followed every rule to the letter, didn’t wander, didn’t touch anything he shouldn’t, didn’t even crack a joke. I should’ve been relieved. Instead, I was still turning the riddle over in my head, staring at the clock every chance I got like it might wink back.

That’s when the door bell chimed.

It wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. My stomach tensed automatically, expecting the Pale Lady’s arrival. But when I turned, it wasn’t her.

She looked—wrong in the most dangerous way—normal.

A young woman, maybe mid-twenties, with a thick curtain of red hair and hazel eyes that caught the light strangely, flickering between green and gold. Her clothes were ordinary. Her smile was easy. And yet the old man’s words rattled in my skull: Humans rarely visit.

She walked straight past me and beelined for Dante. I watched them from the end of the aisle—he looked confused, head tilting like he was trying to place her face.

Then her gaze slid to me. She smiled wider and waved me over.

“You must be the manager,” she said brightly, her eyes skating over the suit. “Do you guys have giggles?”

“…Giggles?” I glanced around, expecting to see someone laughing behind me.

“The cookies,” she said, like that explained everything. “Two shortbread rounds with cream in the middle. Top cookie’s got a smiling face cut into it—like it’s happy to see you.”

Before I could answer, Dante’s expression shifted into something sharp. He stepped between us with a polite, too-wide smile.

“Give me a sec, ma’am.” His tone was polite, but his grip on my arm was iron.

He dragged me to the corner of the aisle, out of earshot. His voice dropped to a whisper.

“That’s not a customer.”

The clock at the center of the store ticked loudly—one… two… three…—each sound heavier than the last, like it was counting something down.

“There’s no way,” Dante muttered, voice low but tense. “But I swear… that’s the infamous Redwood Killer. Red hair, hazel eyes—it all fits. She was active in the 1980s, hunting hikers in the northern California redwood forests. I know this because my best friend did his senior year history project on her just two years ago.”

I blinked at him, expecting a joke. None came.

“When she mentioned Giggles cookies, it clicked,” he continued, voice tightening. “Her MO? She left a Giggles cookie at every crime scene. Eight victims—all young men, late teens or early twenties. And she carved smiles into their faces… to match the cookie.”

He swallowed hard. “She was executed in the early 2000s.”

The clock at the center of the store ticked loudly—one… two… three…—each strike heavier than the last, as if counting down to something.

She was still at the end of the aisle, the packet of Giggles cookies pinched delicately between her fingers, a smile tugging at her lips as if she’d been listening to everything all along.

When she noticed us, she opened the packet and lifted a cookie slightly—like raising a toast—and began moving toward us. Slow. Deliberate.

“Don’t move,” Dante whispered, his voice trembling.

Her footsteps made no sound on the tile. She stopped just a few feet away and tilted her head, those unusual hazel eyes locking on me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.

“You know,” she murmured, “these aren’t as sweet as I remember.” She took a small bite, the crunch echoing far too loudly in the otherwise silent store.

Crumbs fell to the floor, scattering at my shoes like they’d been placed there on purpose.

The clock above us ticked again—four.

Her smile widened, and she leaned in just enough that I caught the faint scent of something coppery beneath the sugar. “You wanna know where it is, don’t you?”

My throat tightened. “Where what is?”

She tilted her head toward the center of the store. “The heartbeat. I can hear it from here.”

Dante’s hand tightened on my arm. I knew exactly what she was talking about.

The riddle from last night burned through my mind:

*Time stands still where shadows meet,*

*Between the heart of store and heat.*

*The keeper’s pulse you seek to find,*

*Ticks softly, hidden just behind.*

The center clock. It had to be.

She walked away without waiting for a response, weaving between aisles until she stood directly beneath the towering clock. She then… looked up at it, like she was listening.

I followed, pulse hammering in my ears. Nothing about the clock seemed out of place—just an ordinary face, ticking toward twelve .

She stepped back and glanced at me. “It’s right there, sweetheart. You just have to look higher.”

The bell chimed.

Twelve O clock 

And the moment the sound rang out, the second hand on the clock *stopped*.

The moment the second hand froze, the air shifted. Not a gentle change, but like the entire store exhaled all at once. The fluorescent lights flickered violently, throwing every aisle into jerking shadows.

I could hear it then—a faint, slow thump, like a heartbeat, echoing through the tile beneath our feet.

The woman tilted her head toward me, still smiling, but now the edges of her face seemed… wrong. Slightly too sharp, too still, like she was stretching toward something beyond human comprehension.

Dante grabbed my arm again. “Remi… don’t—”

But the heartbeat wasn’t coming from her.

It was coming from the clock.

The gears inside it shuddered forward, but not in any human rhythm. Each pulse seemed to travel up through the soles of my shoes, crawl along my spine, and sync with the dagger in my pocket until the metal felt like it was breathing against my thigh.

The Redwood Killer took a step closer, her hazel eyes glinting like knives catching candlelight. “You hear it too, don’t you?”

I didn’t answer, but she smiled like I had.

“I can give it to you,” she murmured, voice low and almost reverent. “The Heart… it’s not something you can reach on your own. The Night Manager’s Heart. You could hold it in your hand… still pulsing, still alive.”

Her smile grew wider—too wide—until her cheeks split open, revealing the same carved grin she’d left on her victims. The raw, red curve stretched from one ear to the other.

“But,” she purred, “I want something in return.”

Her gaze slid past me to Dante.

“Give me your little friend here,” she said, her voice turning almost sing-song. “Just one boy. A fair trade. He’s exactly my type, you know… young, pretty, just old enough to think he can outrun me.”

Dante went rigid beside me, but didn’t speak.

She leaned closer, “One heartbeat for another. You hand him over, and I put the Night Manager’s heart in your hands before the next chime.”

My fingers twitched toward the dagger, but the suit gripped tighter, as if testing me.

“No,” I said, the word scraping out like broken glass.

Her expression didn’t falter. She just tilted her head and smiled that too-wide smile again. “Then you’ll have to be the right hand man forever and you won’t like what he makes you.”

The clock ticked—one.

And I knew the next tick would be louder.

She didn’t leave.

Instead, the Redwood Killer stepped past me like I wasn’t there, moving toward the clock again at the store’s center.

“The last Night Manager,” she sneered, each word sharp as a knife, “gave up his friends for power. Couldn’t stomach being anyone’s right hand.” She now stood directly under the clock. “But you? You can’t even take that step. You’re not fit to be the Night Manager. A fragile human like you… daring to refuse a deal from me?”

Before I could move, her body began to change—limbs stretching unnaturally long, joints bending backward, her red hair bleeding into shadow. Her face split open down the middle, jagged teeth blooming like shards of glass.

She let out a scream so loud the floor vibrated, shelves rattling, light fixtures swaying overhead. My eardrums felt ready to burst.

“DANTE—RUN!” I yelled, shoving him toward the back as she lunged, her claws slicing the air where we’d just been.

We bolted, the aisles narrowing into a blur, her inhuman footsteps hammering after us—faster, closer, wrong. Every shadow seemed to bend toward her, pulled by something I couldn’t name.

We sprinted down the aisle as another light exploded above us. Shards rained down, cutting tiny stings into my face and hands.

Behind us, she didn’t run so much as unfold forward, her body moving in jerks and lurches like something learning how to wear human skin. Her claws raked the shelves, sending cans and boxes cascading into our path.

“Left!” Dante shouted, skidding into the frozen foods section. The cold air hit like a slap.

A row of freezer doors shattered in unison, spraying glass and frost across the floor. I didn’t dare look, but I caught the reflection—her elongated frame moving too fast, joints bending the wrong way, teeth gnashing inches from Dante’s back.

We ducked behind a display of soda crates just as her claws slammed through them, splintering cardboard and spraying fizz in every direction.

“Where do we go?!” Dante shouted, panic threading his voice, eyes darting like he expected her to appear from every shadow.

“I… I don’t know, Dante,” I gasped, clutching my chest as it rose and fell with every ragged breath. “The rules… they said nothing about her.”

Her head snapped around the end of the aisle, those hazel eyes now burning gold, her smile wide enough to split her skull. She hissed, a sound that seemed to crawl under my skin.

The store itself felt like it was reacting to her—aisles shifting subtly, overhead signs twisting, the distance between each aisle stretching longer with every glance.

“Don’t make me chase you,” she cooed, her voice echoing from everywhere at once. “You won’t like how I end it.”

Then she was gone.

The silence was worse.

I grabbed Dante’s arm. “Move.”

We ran again, not knowing where she’d reappear—but the heartbeat from the clock was still pulsing in my chest, faster now, like it was keeping time with hers.

We tore down another aisle, weaving between towers of paper towels and laundry detergent. Every turn I took, I swore I saw her *ahead* of us—just a flicker of that too-long shadow slipping around the corner.

“She’s not following,” Dante panted, glancing over his shoulder.

“That’s the problem,” I said.

The shelves rattled on our left, bottles clinking like teeth. A second later, the right side shook, bags of chips bursting open in a spray of crumbs. She was corralling us.

“Shit—she’s *herding* us,” Dante said, realization dawning in his voice.

I didn’t answer. Because I already knew where she was leading us—straight toward the clock.

The air grew heavier with each step, thick like walking underwater. The heartbeat inside the clock matched mine beat-for-beat, urging me closer.

We tried to cut through housewares, but an entire shelf toppled over without warning, blocking the way. I grabbed Dante’s hand and yanked him down the main aisle, the one that ended right in front of the clock’s hanging frame.

She was waiting there.

Her head tilted at an unnatural angle, smile splitting wider as her voice slithered into my ear even from twenty feet away.

“Almost there, Remi. The store wants you right here.”

That’s when the suit moved.

It tightened around my shoulders and chest, like a hand shoving me forward. My feet locked, then pivoted—not away from her, but toward her. My arm rose on its own, fingers curling around the dagger’s hilt in my pocket.

“Wait—Remi, what are you—?” Dante’s voice barely reached me.

The heartbeat from the clock thundered in my ears, drowning everything else out. The suit whispered in words I couldn’t place, but I understood the intent: Strike. 

I broke into a run—my run, but not my choice—dagger flashing as I charged her.

Her smile faltered the instant I moved.

The suit shoved me forward, my hand yanking the dagger free before I’d even decided to act. My legs pounded against the tile, the heartbeat from the clock roaring in my head like war drums.

She blinked—actually startled—as I slammed the blade into her arm. The dagger flared with a sickly, golden light on impact, and the flesh around the wound blackened instantly, rotting before my eyes.

Her shriek split the air, high and animal. The suit didn’t let me stop. I ripped the dagger free and pivoted, driving it into her other arm. Again, that unnatural glow, and again her skin withered to something brittle and corpse-dark.

“Remi!” Dante’s voice cracked behind me, but I was already backing away, heart hammering, the Redwood Killer clutching her ruined limbs as the rot spread upward. Her scream made the shelves tremble, and I knew—whatever I’d just done—it had only made her angrier.

For a moment, everything froze. Her arms smoked with darkened rot, the air thick with the coppery scent of blood and decay. I staggered back, dagger still in hand, chest heaving. She hadn’t moved—hadn’t attacked again.

Then, with a speed that made my stomach drop, she lunged past me.

Before I could react, her clawed hand wrapped around Dante’s arm. He barely had time to flinch before she yanked him forward, holding him at arm’s length like a shield and a hostage at once.

“Last chance,” she hissed, teeth jagged and glinting, voice low and cruel. “You want to kill me with that dagger? Fine. But if I’m going down…” Her gaze locked on me, deadly. “…he goes down with me.”

Dante struggled against her grip, eyes wide, panic mirrored in my own chest. The heartbeat from the clock thumped faster, every strike hammering against my ribs.

I gripped the dagger tighter. The suit pressed against me again, urging, whispering, pulsing with power I still barely understood.

Her smirk widened, the rot creeping upward from her arms, spreading across her chest. “Decide, little human. Do you take the deal and get the heart… or watch him die losing both him and the heart?”

I froze, my gaze darting between her, Dante, and the rot snaking up her arms. The terms were blatant, cruelly one-sided, as if she expected me to pick the obvious choice—but at the cost of my own humanity.

My mind spun, frantic, until it hit me like a cold slap.

I had nothing to trade. No family to leverage, no safety to surrender. No life to give.

I had taken this job to fix my life. I had run from the place I once called home. I had nothing left.

“I can deal you anything other than Dante…” I said, my voice trembling.

Her eyes narrowed, sharp and cunning, as if she could see every calculation spinning in my head. “You think you have nothing,” she hissed, “but everyone carries something. Fear. Regret. A secret. Something precious you keep hidden even from yourself.”

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry. “What… what do you want?” I whispered.

A twisted smile stretched across her jagged, cracked teeth. “Not him,” she hissed, tilting her head toward Dante. “Not the life you’ve already lost. What I want… is your most treasured memory. In return, I’ll give you the memory of how to defeat the Night Manager—another way, without taking the Heart from the clock—the memory of the last Night Manager’s death.”

For the first time, I understood. I had something to give. Something she wanted that couldn’t be taken by force.

I gripped the dagger tighter. My chest pounded, heartbeat syncing with the clock, but now I knew—I could make a trade without losing Dante. I had the power to bargain with what was already mine: my resolve.

But fear twisted in my gut. I didn’t have many cherished memories left, and the thought of letting one get clawed from my mind, twisted and dissected by her, made me shiver. The memory was mine, fragile and private, yet here it was—the only currency I could offer.

I had no other choice.

So I did the only thing I could.

I said yes.

The world lurched around me as her claws slashed toward my mind, icy fingers scraping at the edges of memory.

Suddenly, I was there—back in the dim, suffocating living room of my childhood. My parents’ voices collided, sharp and violent, shaking the walls. And there she was—my sister, small and trembling, clutching her favorite stuffed animal, eyes wide and fearful.

I laughed, trying to make her giggle despite the chaos. Her tiny hands found mine, and for a heartbeat, the world outside vanished. I made a promise, voice trembling but resolute: “I’ll come back for you. When you turn eighteen, I’ll come. I’ll get you out of here.”

Even then, I knew the truth—I had no money, no plan, no means. It was a fragile promise, born of desperation. I had locked it away in a quiet corner of my mind, kept it safe. But she was here, prying it free.

My sister wasn’t eighteen yet. Five more years. I had five more years to build a life for both of us. And if I lost this memory, I’d lose that purpose too.

The warmth of it twisted, sharp and cold, as her claws brushed over it. Laughter, fear, the promise—it all tore from me. My chest ached, my stomach knotted. The living room blurred, voices echoing into nothingness, leaving only the raw sting of loss.

And yet… I clung to the edges. To the warmth of my sister's hand in mine. To that tiny spark of hope I had. Even if I could never be saved, even if I had nothing left… that spark was mine.

Her grin widened, jagged and cruel, as she drew the memory into herself. I felt it hover between us, tangible, almost breathing. It was gone from my mind, but its weight lingered—a tether, a reminder of everything I had fought to protect. 

The memory I had just given her surged back—only it wasn’t my own anymore. The redwood killer’s presence slammed into me like a tidal wave, her thoughts, her triumphs, her cruelty forcing themselves into my mind. I stumbled backward, gripping my head as flashes of her past assaulted me.

I saw the method to kill the Night Manager. To access his heart, one must enter the store without food for an entire day. Hunger and emptiness were the keys. And the ritual—oh, the ritual—had to be completed before entering, or the Heart would remain forever out of reach.

The ritual itself was simple in words, terrifying in practice. First, stab the hand you intend to use to kill the Night Manager. The suit—the unnatural, living thing hugging my shoulders—would heal the wound. Then, mix your blood with distilled water and drink it before entering the store. That mixture, that act, forged a bond between the killer and the would-be assassin, linking intent, violence, and the unyielding focus needed to claim the Heart.

Another vision struck me with brutal clarity: the previous Night Manager, a woman with bright blue eyes and blonde hair, perfect in every outward way, her humanity stripped away in the end. The current Night Manager had plunged the dagger into her chest, limbs flailing, a scream that was both animal and human. Four strikes to her arms and legs, then one straight through the heart. The screech that followed… it was her humanity clawing its way out, lost forever. I felt the echo of that death in my bones, and it made the air in my lungs thicken.

Her grin split across my mind, stretching too wide, too knowing. “Remember this, little human,” she hissed, her voice curling like smoke around my thoughts. “You weren’t even ready to give up your friend. The easiest path is gone—the heart in the clock should’ve been yours with a single stab. Now…” Her laughter scraped bone. “Now you’ll have to tear it from the Night Manager himself. You’ll need everything—every shred of cunning, every drop of courage. And even then…” Her breath coiled cold against my skull. “…you may still fail.”

I gasped, the force of her memories crashing into me, making my knees buckle. The knowledge was mine now, seared into me like a brand. The steps. The timing. The horror of the Night Manager’s kills. All of it burned behind my eyes. And I understood: the Heart could be taken, yes—but only through unimaginable pain, a ritual carved into flesh, and a battle with the store’s hungry forces.

The Redwood Killer’s voice lingered in my skull as her memories bled back into her, leaving me hollow. *“If you kill the night manager, you will become him”*

My body revolted. I doubled over, heaving until everything I’d eaten—pizza, water, Gatorade—spilled onto the floor. The bitter taste burned my throat. When I wiped my mouth and looked up, she was no longer the rotting creature but the redhead with hazel eyes, smiling like nothing had happened.

“Thank you for the excellent customer service,” she said lightly. “I haven’t had a deal in a while. A memory for a memory. Thank you again.”

And then she strolled out of the store, as if she hadn’t just gutted me from the inside out.

I don’t remember when I blacked out. All I know is that when I woke, my skull was splitting open with pain, and the first thing I saw was Dante, snoring in a chair. We were in the breakroom.

“Dante…” My voice was raw as I shook him awake. It was 6 a.m. We left together, the morning sun painting the parking lot in pale gold. 

I told him everything. Every detail I could still remember. His face darkened, shadows cutting across his features. Finally, he asked, voice tight with fear, “Remi… if you kill him… will you become him? I don’t want you to die.”

I swallowed hard, every heartbeat echoing in my chest. “If I become him… if I can’t destroy the store—which I won’t, because the old man warned me: no one can resist the store’s desire—then promise me one thing.”

His eyes searched mine.

“Promise me you’ll burn it down,” I said, voice low but steady. “The store is vulnerable when I transform to become the Night Manager. That’s when it has no protection. That’s when you strike. You’ll burn the store, and me, down together.”

Dante looked away, jaw tight, shoulders stiff. He didn’t answer, but the tension in his stance said everything. Then without a word he swung his leg over the bike, his grip tightening on the handlebars, knuckles paling as he held himself steady. 

He didn’t look at me, only letting out a dry, cracked laugh. “Burn the store down, huh? That’s quite the last request. You sure you don’t want me to bury you under the frozen pizza section instead? At least then you’d go out with pizza to eat later.” 

I shot him a look, but he kept staring straight ahead, shoulders stiff. After a pause, his voice softened, quieter this time. “Just… don’t make me do it, Remi. Don’t make me torch the place knowing you’re still in there.” Then almost immediately, he shrugged it off, masking his worry with a smirk. “Anyway, if you actually pull this off, drinks are on you. I’m not risking my fake ID for your ‘I survived the Night Manager’ party.” He revved the bike before I could even respond, shattering the heavy silence that had settled between us. I stood there, hoodie thrown over my suit, looking utterly ridiculous as he sped off.

That’s when it hit me. Tomorrow might be the final day. For the store. For me. Maybe both.

And already… things are slipping.

That’s the real reason I’m writing this. If I don’t, there won’t be anything left to hold onto. I can *feel* the gaps widening, pulling at me. I’ve already forgotten my sister’s name. I’ve forgotten her birthday. I can’t remember the number of the house we grew up in, or the street it was on.

Worse—her face is gone.

I know I had one person left in this world worth saving. I know I made a promise to her, something that kept me moving when I wanted to quit. But now, all I have is the ache of that promise, the hollow outline of someone I loved.

The Redwood Killer said she wanted a memory. I didn’t think it would unravel me like this.

I’m terrified of what else I’ll lose tomorrow night.

Because if I forget her completely. If I forget why I’m fighting.....what’s left of me to save?
