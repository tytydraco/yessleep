Okay, I don’t really post much but I need to get this off my chest because I can’t sleep.

We moved into a house on Redthorn Close earlier this year. It seemed like the perfect little cul-de-sac. Quiet, safe, family-friendly. We were excited for our daughter Sophie to grow up here.

The neighbours at number 16 (the Hargreaves) introduced themselves on the second day. Older couple, probably late 50s. The husband barely blinks when he talks, and the wife smiles too much, like she’s rehearsed it in a mirror. They gave us a pie as a “welcome gift,” but it smelled off, almost chemical. We threw it away.

That was the first red flag.

After that, weird stuff started happening:

At night we’d hear scratching inside the walls, like something was trying to get through.

Our locks kept jamming, like someone had been messing with them.

Sophie’s toys would disappear from our garden, then show up a few days later neatly arranged on the Hargreaves’ porch.

I asked Mrs. Hargreaves if she’d seen Sophie’s missing doll once, and she just leaned in and whispered:
“Children wander. Sometimes they don’t come back.”

I laughed nervously but I haven’t forgotten it.

At night we’d hear noises from their house thuds, dragging sounds, sometimes what honestly sounded like a muffled scream. My husband tried to call the police once when it got really bad, but weirdly the line was dead every time he picked up the phone. And their curtains always glowed red at night, like they had some kind of furnace burning.

Then one evening, Sophie disappeared.

The garden gate was wide open, and there was a trail of chalk drawings leading from our driveway straight to their house. I ran over in a panic and banged on their door. Mr. Hargreaves answered. His hands were raw and wet, like he’d been digging. He just said, “We haven’t seen her.” But I swear on my life I heard Sophie giggling inside.

My husband lost it. That night he broke into their basement.

What we found… I still shake thinking about it. The walls were lined with children’s shoes. Dozens of them. Some so old they looked like they’d been there for decades. Others looked almost new. There were shelves filled with dolls with missing eyes. And in the corner was a pit in the floor, covered with lime. Sophie was sitting at the edge of it, holding one of the dolls, absolutely terrified.

When we grabbed her, we turned around and the Hargreaves were standing there. Just standing. Smiling like they’d been expecting us.

“You wanted peace,” the wife said.
“But Redthorn Close keeps its children.”

We got Sophie out. We drove all night and we’ve never gone back to that house.

Here’s the thing: I’ve Googled them. There’s nothing. No record. No photos. Like they don’t exist. And if you go to Redthorn Close today, their house looks perfectly normal. Curtains drawn. Garden neat. Like nothing ever happened.

But sometimes… people still move into that cul-de-sac. Families with kids. And I don’t see them around for long.
