This has been a long time coming, but I need to get this off my chest. I grew up near a fishing town on the coast of New Jersey. It wasn’t anything special outside of the massive lighthouse near the rockier part of the shoreline. I suppose that’s what brought this memory back to the forefront of the mind, as I saw a similar looking one on a recent trip to Virginia. It was a monolith of white and gray, its age betrayed by the peeling paint on the exterior. The place always fascinated me as a kid, especially since I was never allowed to go near it. Everyone’s parents forbade their children from stepping as much as one foot towards it, which of course sparked my interest even more. I suppose in retrospect they had good reason to be wary. 

Darrin and I had known each other since kindergarten. It was such a small town that everyone knew everyone, and the same could be said for us kids. I recall the first time we met vividly, as he split apart a PB&J sandwich before throwing the side coated with peanut butter at my hair. Not exactly the most flattering first impression, I know. The irony is not lost on me that my first friend was also my first bully. Thankfully, he didn’t stay a bully for long.

Once we got into elementary school, our friendship only deepened. We could babble on about whatever things interested us for hours, especially since both of us were massive He-Man fans at the time. To an outsider we must have looked anything but precocious, as we continued our streak of acting younger than our age. Neither of us were the mature type, to be perfectly blunt. Those times have faded into little more than warm hazes of memory, but I still appreciate them for what they were. They were the only times I was truly happy. 

It wasn’t until fifth grade that we became properly obsessed with that lighthouse at the edge of town. My parents may have not been around all that often, working as contractors at a nearby company, but they were still strict about one thing and one thing only; don’t go near the fucking lighthouse. I don’t add the “fucking” for dramatic effect, that was exactly how they would phrase it. It was particularly striking to me as they would never curse under any other circumstances. Any swearing they did would come up in the same sentence as the word “lighthouse”. It had the opposite effect than what it was meant to have, as I became exponentially more interested in what secrets it could hold that would spur my parents to drop their calm facade, if only briefly. That interest was further compounded when I talked to Darrin about it. Mentioning it to him was and still is the biggest mistake of my life.

We were walking home from school on a particularly windy day when I first brought it up. The lighthouse was in view, which is what brought the thought to mind. All it took was a few words to capture Darrin’s attention completely.

“Have you ever been over there?”

Darrin’s eyes lit up. He brushed his drape of curly hair out of his eyes. Then he told me something which would be the epicenter of my interest for years to come.

“I saw the light turn orange last night! I stayed up till 1:00 and it was orange!”

He was so excited when he said it that I couldn’t help but become similarly excited. To anyone else, that would’ve been the biggest nothing-burger in existence, yet it was a revelation to my 10 year old brain. Any time I had seen the light cut through the darkness during late nights, it had shone a brilliant white. The idea that it could suddenly glow a dull orange was inconceivable. It brought up a simple question to me: Why? My curiosity was boundless. I don’t remember what else was said, but that question remains burned into my memory. Who knew one simple word could do so much damage. 

Nothing particularly notable happened for a while after, as Darrin and I made our way through middle school without incident, although that lighthouse still came up in conversation from time to time. It was in freshman year of high school that a rift formed between us. We started to drift apart in our interests, with each day having less and less for us to talk about. Eventually, we stopped talking entirely. It happened so slowly that at the time I didn’t notice. It was only once a profound emptiness in me started to grow that I came to terms with the fact that I had lost my only true friend. People tend to understate how much social interaction matters. I think I was guilty of that, until the lack of it started to affect me. That freshman year became a very lonely year in record time. 

Over time I became desperate to rekindle our friendship, especially as the summer neared its end. I refused to go through another school year alone. I just couldn’t do it. I racked my brain trying to think of something we could do that could be reminiscent of old times. It was in that state of mind that the epiphany of the lighthouse struck me. What if I could get him on board to visit it some time? Furthermore, what if we could stake it out until the light turned orange? I would be killing two birds with one stone, as I could solve the mystery we were once invested in and hopefully convince Darrin to be my friend again. This was naive thinking, but I was willing to do anything. No cost was too great. Too bad my conception of cost was far below the reality life would provide me with. Sorry, would provide *us* with. 

There was only one week left before sophomore year would start when I decided to bite the bullet and head over to Darrin’s house. I used to spend a lot of time there, but had not stepped foot into the place since the end of middle school. It was around 7pm and the lights were on, so I figured there was no harm in just knocking on the door. After about the third rap against the wood, the door swung open. Darrin stood in the opening, looking a little taller since I had last seen him, with his curly hair cut short. He looked surprised to see me. 

“Hey man, what’s up?” he said, the slightest hint of caution present in his tone. 

“How would you feel about visiting the lighthouse tonight when the light glows orange?”

A hint of recognition flashed on his face. Old memories brought back, perhaps. His inner conflict unfolded in front of me, the creasing of eyebrows making it all the more evident. I saw the cogs turn, and knew what Darrin was going to say before he even said it.

“Sure. It’ll happen at around 1:00. That’s when it always happens,” he said, an old excitement having been reignited.

He must’ve asked his parents to stay the night at my place under false pretenses, as they didn’t raise any concerns for the brief moment I saw them. My parents had been out all day for a job, so it was a perfect opportunity. Lord knows they would’ve never allowed us to do what we were planning on doing, visiting the “fucking lighthouse”. We waited long into the night, silences interspersed with scattered conversation. I was disappointed by the fact that we still had little to talk about outside of the standard catching up questions. He was certainly a different person than who he had been when we were closer, and it was painful to realize that in real time. In a rare moment of self reflection for high school me, I wondered if it would be better for me to move on rather than cling to something which had already run its course. I wish I could’ve come to that conclusion sooner. 

We were bored out of our minds when 1:00 finally rolled around, not to mention tired. Our decision making likely wasn’t in peak shape because of that. Darrin and I took 5 minute turns looking out the window of my house which faced the lighthouse, waiting for the white light to shift. It was my third time looking when something finally happened. It seemed impossible at the time, but the light turned from its blazing white to an eerie orange in a single short blink. I had to rub my eyes and do a double take, considering that I might be hallucinating. It was my first time seeing the light like that. The orange glow was unlike any hue I had seen, with no plant or animal I have ever witnessed matching it. It pulsed as if in tune to the beat of a faraway heart, beckoning and warning at the same time. 

“Darrin, look!” I said in a choked voice. He wheeled around to face the window, and I saw that orange light reflected in his eyes. There was hunger to his eyes. The hunger for knowledge, and for curiosity to be sated. 

“Let’s go,” he said, stealing my dad’s jacket from a chair as he went.

The air was surprisingly chill as we exited the house, with my short sleeve shirt doing little to protect me from the biting cold. Darrin had made the right call bringing a jacket. We stumbled over the gravel and rocks as we got closer to the intimidating metal door to the lighthouse. I tripped bad enough that I scraped my knee against one particularly sharp rock, the blood creating a deep red splotch on my jeans. I kept going, my adrenaline too high to register the pain. We were about to do something no one in the town had down before, ignoring the ghost stories and urban legends. The orange glow could fade at any second, so we had no time to waste. 

As my hands gripped the freezing metal of the door, a strange feeling overtook me. The feeling of subdued dread, creeping its way into my chest. The feeling that comes with doing something you know you shouldn't. I wrenched open the door, pleasantly surprised to find it was not locked. For something so feared by the community, you’d think someone would lock it up, but I suppose no one wanted to be near it to begin with.

“Wait a second,” Darrin said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “We should flip a coin, see who goes up the stairs first. I’ll take tails.”

He took a nickel out of his pocket, flipping it up in the hair. He missed catching it though, the coin uselessly clattering against the stones. We both kneeled down to see what face had come up, Darrin smiling as he saw. It came up tails. He walked in front of me with a confidence I had rarely seen from him, taking a small flashlight out of his other pocket. I hadn’t even considered that we might need a light source, so it was a good thing he brought one. 

We ventured in, Darrin’s flashlight painting the room with a similar blinding white to that which was normally produced by the lighthouse. I only fully grasped the magnitude of how tall the structure was when he pointed the flashlight upwards, revealing a circular abyss in the space not covered by the spiral staircase. It looked far taller than it appeared on the outside. At first, I chalked that up to just a difference in perspective, but a certain fear gripped me as we started our ascent. We walked up metal steps for what seemed like minutes, yet whenever Darrin pointed the light upwards, we seemed no closer to the top. There was no way it was that tall. Any normal person would’ve left the moment that things stopped making sense, but I felt an inexplicable compulsion to keep climbing.

After what must have been about five minutes of nonstop climbing, I began to notice changes to the interior. The smooth white paint started to give way to darker shades, complete with intricate designs. They almost looked like carvings in the wall, matching no architecture style I can think of. Darrin must have been feeling the sense of uneasiness that I was, but he too was compelled to keep going. It was as though the moment we stepped into the lighthouse, reaching the top no longer became a question. It was an inevitability. 

Both of us were exhausted and panting when we saw it. A dull, almost imperceptible glow came into view towards what must have been the top of the spiral. Darrin turned towards me, his eyes wild and his legs shaking. He picked up the pace, nearly tripping over the metal steps as he raced towards the orange light. I also quickened my ascent, but was unable to keep up with him, as he and his flashlight disappeared from view. I blindly fumbled towards the glowing orange when I saw Darrin by the opening which presumably led to the light itself. He had completely stopped, and was facing away from me. The moment he turned to face me remains as the worst moment of my life.

Illuminated by the orange glow, I saw that he was sweating bullets. Tears leaked from his eyes and splashed onto the harsh metal below us. Every part of his body quivered as though he had run a marathon. When I heard a consistent dripping sound, I looked down to see that Darrin’s pant leg was wet. There was urine running down his leg and onto the floor. It was in that moment that whatever spell the lighthouse had over me dissipated. I was not going to step foot into the room housing the light. 

It was in that moment of realization that I witnessed something snap in Darrin. Looking into his eyes again, I saw they were hollow of whatever was once there. He had been shunted out of his own flesh, and something else had taken his place. It shambled towards me, a puppet learning how to walk for the first time. Its joints cracked and bones twisted. It was like a toddler trying to crawl around in someone else’s skin, unaware of its own anatomical limitations. The worst part was the complete lack of expression on the face of what was once Darrin. I wondered for a split second if he was still in there, somewhere, screaming internally as his body moved on its own. My heart broke as I made my decision to run.

I shot down the stairs, my footsteps rattling against the metal and echoing in a cacophony of noise in the enclosed space. I could hear the same cracking and sputtering behind me as I went. It appeared like it was moving slowly whenever I looked back, yet each movement sounded alarmingly close. I was at the bottom in what felt like less than 30 seconds, far less time than it had taken to get up. The glow of the moonlight painted the opening, acting as a salvation to the utter terror which gripped me. As I took my first step out of the lighthouse, I heard a loud tumbling noise coming from behind me. I turned around, bracing myself for the worst.

I nearly breathed a sigh of relief when I saw Darrin’s crumpled form as it slowly heaved in and out. That relief quickly faded as I noticed the way its neck was bent. It looked completely broken, and I could only watch as its fingers and legs seized uncontrollably, racked with intense twitching. When I looked at its face, the same expressionless visage greeted me. That was, until I noticed its reddened eyes welling up with tears. There was now fear behind those eyes. Fear of dying. I broke down, sobbing as what was my only friend let out a few more gasps for air that wouldn’t come, its windpipe too crushed to receive it. I looked up, the light having returned to its normal white, apathetic to what it had just caused.

I moved out of town as soon as I graduated high school. I couldn’t bear to live there anymore after what had happened. His parents blamed me, and they even told me to my face that I should’ve died instead of him. Sometimes I can’t help but agree with them. I made up a story about us visiting the lighthouse in the dark, and that Darrin tripped, falling down the stairs and breaking his neck. Thankfully, it was believed to be an accident by the broader community. That was only half true, of course.

 I’ve never spoken about that orange light to anyone, nor the enchanting glow it produced. Not even my parents know of what really happened that night. I just wanted to get it off my chest somewhere. I still can’t help missing Darrin. To this day he was the one friend I ever had. I hope that when he looked into that light, he saw something beautiful. I know that’s probably not true, but I still hope. Now, I can only wonder, what would I have seen if that coin we flipped landed on heads?

If anyone sees this and lives in a coastal region, please stay away from abandoned lighthouses. They are abandoned for a reason.
