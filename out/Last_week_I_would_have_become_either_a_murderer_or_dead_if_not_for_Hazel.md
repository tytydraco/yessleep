My heart is beating. Am I really alive? Am I just a shell? Maybe I am just a real life zombie. If not, what else can explain all that emptiness? Something is broken inside me or rather something is missing.

Nothing enlightens my soul, not even that thing called love. Does it really exist? At least, there is a thrill I always wished I had the courage to try.

Alone among over 7 billion people, I sat in a night club drowning my misery in a glass of whiskey. Soon, the impulses arose again, and I decided to leave at around 2 am before committing the worst.

Let me just focus on the floor as I walk, let me not be tempted and just go home, I thought. However, as the saying goes, if you do not want to go to something, then that something comes to you.

"You should come and see that." The man said, standing in front of a tuck shop wall.

"What?" I replied, puzzled and looking around, not sure he was talking to me.

"Come and see for yourself." The man spoke with his low and deep voice.

I carefully approached and stood next to him, expecting to see something that would finally ignite something positive in my empty soul. The moment I saw what he stood there contemplating, I regretted approaching.

For various reasons ranging from advertising to announcement, many posters covered the wall, but the man had his entire attention captured by the ones displaying missing persons.

"Fascinating right? Three women in three weeks, or one per week." The man said with so much admiration that I looked at him with confusion.

"Fascinating? I said, watching him turn to me, his hair hidden in a beanie and his eyes hidden behind sunglasses during a winter night.

"No. You see this can work with everyone out there, but not with me." He said, still smiling. "I don't need eyes to see, but I can see it in your eyes. Let it out my friend, let it out and free yourself."

I did not say a word and started walking away. He just stood there watching me leave and smiling at me like the nutcase he is. What was I even doing outside? After all, I had classes to attend at college later.

Morning found me looking at the ceiling, something I had been doing for hours, my soul still tormented by last night's strange encounter. I was torn between good and evil as a raging battle ripped my soul apart.

"Should I finally give in to the temptation? Should I do it or not?" I whispered. I ultimately chose to let my heart decide. I chose to let my heart guide me and tell me what to do. I decided to give in to the impulses.

No school today, I thought when I finally left my bed. First, let me get the material I needed. In no time, I found myself speeding through the shelves of a supermarket, powered by a long time forgotten feeling.

Something had just been launched, like a machine or rocket I could no longer stop no matter what.

As a second step, I spent literally a whole day monitoring an abandoned candy factory where I hoped that I would enjoy maximum privacy to create my first masterpiece.

The careful selection had to be the third step. I logged on the campus website to retrieve the complete list of students currently registered to the institution, and spent long hours looking for the ideal candidate despite already having her name in mind. Obviously, I ended up choosing her.

I intended to launch a three day observation period before action. I even considered making it several weeks long, but I could no longer hold myself as the impulses grew stronger by the minute. I needed to do it, and it had to be the day after.

Friday, February 10th 2023

Today is the day, I thought, while driving to the campus at around 3 pm. For a reason only her knew, she never agreed to be given a lift to her address and preferred the long walk to the bus station.

Her usual behavior bore no consequences for my plan. I parked on the roadside and waited, just like a hunter ready to make a deadly move on its prey.

At around 5 pm, she appeared in the rear view mirror. Hazel, with her brown hair, glasses and headset. Not the social butterfly, always alone and minding her own business. I could not ask for someone better.

From the glove box, I retrieved a chemistry book, a subject I knew we both study currently. I waited for her to walk next to the car before talking to her.

"Hazel?" I called after rolling the window down.

"Austin?" She replied with her very soft voice after removing her headset.

"Hey! How you doing? It's been a while." I said, getting out of the car, still holding the book.

"Yeah I mean, you've not been there for like, the whole week?"

"Yeah I wasn't feeling good at all and there's this first chapter I really don't get." I said, showing her the book.

"Oh that? Relax dude it's only like the second week of the semester." She said between a few chuckles.

"Yeah but, I got all that pressure from my parents so, I really need some help."

"Okay so have you—"

"Can you help me? Please?" I cut her short, knowing she was about to direct me to the teacher.

"The Thing's that I really— can't right now I have to—"

"No, no, no, not like right now but even on Monday during a break? If you don't mind? Please."

"Well, yeah cool. On Monday."

"Oh thank you so much."

"Okay so see—"

"Do you— mind if I drop you off?" I proposed, but she kept quiet, thinking and hesitating. "Not at your home, like just there by the bus station? At least?"

"Bus station, yeah. That's cool. Thanks."

Hazel walked to the passenger side and I prepared for the decisive next move. She got in and started looking for the seat belt, while I reached out for something behind her seat.

"So what were you doing around here if—" She tried saying when I suddenly put my hand on her mouth and injected her in the neck with the content of the syringe I retrieved seconds earlier.

I then seized her right arm to prevent her from opening the door and waited less than 5 seconds for the powerful sedative to kick in. I released my grip on her and she just looked at me completely terrified, slowly fainting while trying to say something:

"Please don't let— he will k— he will— he will—"

There was no going back from that. I had to do what I had to do. After the little adrenalin rush from the action in the car, I had driven to the abandoned candy factory where the real deal was set to happen.

Hands and feet tied, Hazel lied unconscious on a table, while I prepared every tool I needed to let my impulses finally run wild and free on that innocent soul.

"Amateur." I heard from a deep male voice echoing in the silence of the factory.

"Who's there?" I asked, looking around with my nail gun already in hand. "Who the fuck is—" I stopped when I saw Hazel sitting on the table with her eyes still closed.

"I have to admit that I'm very, very disappointed in you Austin. A nail gun? Really?" I heard the deep male voice say, however, it was coming from Hazel's mouth and it sounded very familiar.

"What? What the—"

"Grown-up things aren't for brats. Kiddo." She said, using a herculean force to tear the buff tape and free her hands and feet at the same time.

I shot her with the nail gun but she caught the projectile with her hand while her eyes were still shut. I tried a second, then a third and a fourth time, yet she was able to catch all the nails, no matter the distance.

"I told you Austin, I don't need eyes to see." She spoke.

The words rang a loud bell in my mind. I had already heard it before, the previous Monday, from that strange man after the nightclub. Still, I could not comprehend why Hazel spoke like him.

Hazel then dropped all the nails she caught except for one that she yeeted straight to my thigh. It tore through the flesh and exited on the other side. I fell on the floor screaming in pain, turned and started crawling away from a prey that turned into a hunter.

She sauntered behind me, her eyes still closed, but following me calmly. I had no idea what to do for something so unexpected and crawled helplessly not knowing if each effort made would be the last.

"Quite unexpected, right? Well, Hazel and I share this little body. She's in charge when she's awake and I'm in charge when she sleeps. Only five hours a day, but with what you gave her, I think I'll have extra hours today. The disguise though, that's the part I don't like." He, she or whoever that freaking demon was, explained.

"HELP! HEEELP!" I shouted in despair.

"I could see you all this time you know. She can't because she's so gullible but me... During classes, at the library, you kept on just watching her. That's when I knew what was burning inside of you."

"Who are you? What are you?" I asked, when I reached a wall with no further way to escape the assailant.

"Me? Well, you can call me Twin or just T if you want. It doesn't really matter anyway, you're about to die."

I pulled out my pocket knife as my last mean of defense. Twin just seized my forearm and broke the bones like dry branches. I screamed in pain but stopped when he seized my neck and lifted me above him. That girl, that person was really demon possessed and too strong. It was the end.

"I thought you were worth it, but you're just a kid. I could have done a fourth girl this week but instead I had to handle this? This is my turf by the way, back off!" Twin said.

"Please, please,..." I painfully repeated.

"So pathetic! You lucky Hazel just convinced me to let you live." Twin said and dropped me on the floor. "Get up! I'm in a good mood today. Let me have a ride with your little baby out there." He added.

***

Twin drove skilfully, eyes still completely shut and humming a tune while doing so. I saw the bliss on Hazel's face, Twin was having the time of his life, maybe even doing it for the first time.

In pain and absolute shame, I was seated next to him, crying silently. The setting sun in the horizon looked like a door full of light I was advancing towards.

Whatever was broken inside me seemed to have vanished after flirting with death. Why was I trying to ruin my life? How killing would have fixed my soul? It would have only destroyed me further.

My redemption did not lie in the death of another soul.

"That was a blast!" Twin said after suddenly parking. He opened the car door and spoke before he exited. "Remember kiddo. This is my turf. If you wanna play, play somewhere else." He added.

I sped off to safety as soon as Hazel was out of my car and did not even look back at her. To this day, I am still recovering from the wounds and from the shock.

Nevertheless, I found the courage to work on myself and fight for a better life by doing things that are right. One of those things is to find a way to get Hazel/Twin in jail for what She/He did, demon possessed or not.

Who knows? Instead of killing, maybe I am meant to catch the killers. All I know is that a second chance has been given to me, and I intend to use it wisely and to the fullest.
