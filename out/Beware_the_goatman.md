Perched on the shoulder of a windswept Welsh hill was our new home. A stout, white cottage beside a lone gravel track that continued further into the rugged wilds of this green and grey landscape. Lichen-spotted stone walls snaked over the terrain and sheep grazed contentedly. I peered into the bedroom window and saw Ashleigh on a work call, nodding away, gesturing, making a point. It was refreshing to see her so lively after what the cancer treatment had done to her. Warm lamplight bathed that face I’d never get tired of seeing.

We’d ditched London for Western Wales once she went into remission, bringing our son Archie with us. I’m a doctor and she’s a marketing exec, so it was a simple case of me getting a transfer to the local surgery- her job was remote. Archie was just about to begin his schooling, so it was now or never. We chose the former. 

I went over to the wall and touched one of the many stones. Wobbled it around like a loose tooth. City boy that I am, I couldn’t understand how something so fragile could be so enduring. This wall, our wall now, I suppose, had undoubtedly stood for centuries. 

“Daddy, look at this!” Archie said. He was pushing a red tractor around on the front lawn, blonde hair whipping in the wind. 

“Wow!” I said, squatting next to him. 

He kept building a stack of pebbles, wreathing them with a tuft of animal hair that had blown onto the grass, and smashing it down with the tractor.

“Careful, Archie. You’ll break it.”

“But that’s how you get him, daddy. Die, goatman, die!”

“Goatman?” 

“Yeah, he’s a man with a goat's head. And he’s EVIL!”

With that, Archie smashed the rock pile down again.

“That’s enough now. It’s starting to rain anyway, look.” I said, pointing up at the leaden skies. 

Nobody likes to get rained on, yet I actually like the unpredictable microclimate out here. I’d read somewhere that South-East England was drier than parts of the Sahara. 

“Do you want to come to the shop with me, or stay here with mummy?”

Archie deliberated, a twinkle in his eye. “Can I get some sweeties, please?”

Chancer, just like his dad. “Maybe. Come on then.”

We bounced down the two miles of gravel track until the tyres of my car found tarmac. Ten minutes later, I pulled up to the convenience store, leaving Archie to snooze in the passenger seat. 

The shop was all dirty glass, rotten wood and chipped paint. A bell rang as I pushed open the door. A grey-haired woman stepped out of the back and took a seat by the till. I smiled but she was wrapped up in her own world, eyes unfocused, and presumably crushed by boredom. I grabbed the essentials Ash had asked for, along with something for Archie, and went to pay.

“Hello, just these, please.”

She punched some buttons on the till and I tapped my debit card. Everything about her was detached, casual, absent. Everything apart from the fidgeting hand at her throat. She was rubbing furiously at a silver pendant in the shape of a tri-spiral. It was an ancient Celtic symbol: the triskelion. 

“Diolch.” I said.

“Storm tonight. Stay in.” She said softly, still looking off into space. I hesitated, nodded, and left.

Back in the car, I felt a cold finger trace the length of my spine. 

“Baaaa.” Archie said, pawing at the window and the sheep beyond.

“Stop that, Arch. You’ll muck up the glass with your fingerprints”

He crossed his arms and scowled. “Goatman will get you.”

We pulled onto the drive and Archie charged inside to find someone more fun than me. I savoured a deep breath of that pure, mountain air, and went into the house. Archie was wriggling on the sofa next to Ashleigh, TV babbling in the background. 

“Leave your mum be, Arch. She’s had a long day.” I said, putting the shopping away.

“Do as your dad says.” Ashleigh said, giving me a tired smile. 

Tough as a nut, she was. Cancer survivor. Fighter. Mother. Friend. The love of my life. It’d killed me seeing her in distress throughout her treatment. The emotional agony. Tears. Fears. The what-ifs. Hair loss. Weight gain. Allergic reactions. Side effects. One night, as I held the bucket to catch her vomit in a pitch-black bedroom, feeling trains rumble by, I pitched the idea to her. Let’s get out. The three of us. Life is fleeting, after all. I couldn’t see her, but I felt her palm cup my cheek, and I knew she wanted it too.

“How was work?” I asked. 

“Yeah, fine.”

“Good.”

Time was sliding by. I cooked, and we ate, relishing this shelter from the downpour that had begun outside. While I scrubbed the pots, Ashleigh put Archie to bed before saying she was going too. 

“I’ve got a headache. Could be a migraine. Hope not.” She said, rubbing an eye.

“No problem, Ash. Sleep well.”

She kissed my cheek and glided out of the kitchen toward the bedroom. I sat on the couch, opened a beer and put on some trashy TV. Two men were sawing a hole through some ice in Alaska, presumably to catch fish. One of them addressed the camera, gesticulating and pointing behind him at his colleague. 

A fork of lightning lit the sky to my right and I snapped my head towards the window. Silhouetted there was the shape of a short, wiry man with the head of a goat, staring in at me. BOOM. The thunder rolled in, rained pelted the window, and I sat frozen. Another fork struck, further away this time. The light revealed a quite normal scene. There was nobody there. BOOM. I stood, and went to the window. Sheet lightning lit the barren landscape again, and I was still alone. Had I imagined it? BOOM. I went to bed.

Ash was asleep, but restless. She moaned and twitched and mumbled.

“I can’t see. I can’t.” She muttered.

“Shhh, it’s alright.” I whispered. She had flashbacks to low points in her treatment sometimes, so I assumed it was one of those.

“Where he. Where he goes. Nobody knows. They don’t know! He with the horns! He’s here. The calamity. He’s here!”

Beneath the curtain was the charcoal darkness of a foul night, the closest streetlight perhaps five hundred metres away, but it slowly grew darker. A purer black. Someone was standing there. 

“No. I don’t want to. Please!” Ashleigh mumbled, forehead slick with sweat. 

I rose, reaching for the curtain, where the shadow shifted. I ripped it across, and a shape darted around the side of my home. I burst out of the room, grabbed a kitchen knife, and swung open the front door. 

Gale-buffeted and rain-lashed, I stood there on the threshold of my new home in the middle of the night. I restrained my breathing to listen, eyes scouring the gloom for this phantom. The Welsh hills were the anvil for Thor’s great hammer as the next lightning assault struck, off to the north. I blinked raindrops away and caught a snapshot of the scene. I saw dry-stone walls, my lawn, my car. I saw looming hills framing a wide valley. And I saw a distant figure, naked and pale, crouched and running beside the path that led deeper into the wild. Body of a man. Head adorned with the skull of a goat. Two curved horns hanging above bony shoulders. Darkness returned, and with it, the soft peal of thunder. 

The next day, I was troubled. I resolved to get security cameras fitted, and floodlights. Should I have rung the police? What would I tell them? Had the guy actually committed a crime? Deeper down, I wondered whether he actually existed at all. I went outside. It was blustery and bright. Archie was arranging pebbles on the lawn. 

“What you making, Archie?”

“A shape goatman doesn’t like. I hate him.”

My eyes bulged. I’d seen the shape not twenty-four hours prior in the convenience store around the neck of a troubled woman. A triskelion.

I’m conscious of overreacting, but after everything Ashleigh has been through, I don’t think this situation is tenable. Even if it turns out to be some prankster. I’m seriously considering putting the house back on the market and getting out of here. Beware.
