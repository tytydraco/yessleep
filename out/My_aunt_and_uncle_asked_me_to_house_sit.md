I walked into my aunt and uncle's house, and as I was walking through the dining room, I saw a figure alone in the side room. I'm not sure what to call it, it was like a small room with a small table for eating alone, I suppose. 

I don't want to investigate. I have a sense of impending doom. But my aunt and uncle are gone and I'm house sitting, it's just my girlfriend and myself here and I want to make sure we are safe and alone. So I slid my back against the far wall to stay as far away from that room as possible. While I peek around the threshold of the door, I saw the figure.

The room was dim, but I could still make out who it was. It was my great grandma. She died back in 2018, but here she was. But she was younger than when she died. She wasn't super young again, maybe in her forties. I am not sure why, but I have a bad feeling that should be more important to me, but all I can do is cry because there she is, and I miss her so much. So many important things have happened in my life since she passed, like the passing of her son, my grandpa who was like a father to me. I wanted to know how he was, and I had all these thoughts racing through my head. How could she be here? All of this was processed in my head in a matter of seconds when I finally thought to increase my distance from her just to be safe. 

I still had a nagging feeling in the back of my head that she shouldn't be appearing to me at such an odd age. I wasn't sure why that specific bit of information was so important to me, but it was. The next thing I know, I'm about to move to run back to my girlfriend and stand by her side, but before I can even budge, my grandma is walking through the threshold. As she walks in, I notice she's not alone. There are two men with her, but I was so focused on her that I couldn't make out exactly what their features are. 

She starts asking me how I've been and so many more questions too fast for me to process. The sense of impending doom I had only moments ago has grown to an intolerable size, and I felt as though I would be crushed at any moment. Fight or flight had to have kicked in because I had no way to explain what I was feeling. I looked her dead in the eye, and I wasn't even sure why I said it. It's like I had no control over what I was thinking any longer. I screamed, "I banish you, devil," with an odd emphasis on devil. I didn't know if this was The Devil, but I knew it had to be evil. As soon as those first few words of my sentence left my lips, her face contorted into such anger, I had a bad feeling I was right, but I continued, "I banish you back to hell in the name of God's love and all that is light." 

The next thing I know is there's a lightshow behind my eyes, and I am on the ground. I must've passed out. My first thought was there's no way that was the top dog of hell, but I sure hope it's gone. I sit up to see a blast radius in the middle of the room, and my girlfriend is still right where I left her, but she's out just as I was. She must've been frozen in fear, too. I begin to get up to go to her to see if she's okay when I am stopped at the sign of movement elsewhere in the room. 

My head turns towards the movement, and it's one of those other figures that walked into the room with her. Before I know it, I start trying to "banish" this one, too, but I'm feeling much less confident. There's no way what I said earlier had any real power, but something came over me and gave me power. Something I no longer felt. The figure just looked like a disheveled man with a beard and long hair. He cut me off mid sentence and told me, "I am not like the other two, you can't banish me, I am only a human follower" then he lunged at me and shouted I must pay for what I've done. We start to struggle, and all I can think of is that I need to get back to my girlfriend to make sure she's okay. 

But the next thing I know is I wake up in bed, and she's next to me. We are in my aunt and uncles house, and I realize the house in my dream wasn't even their's, why did I have the idea it was while I was there? Why did everything feel so real? Why did it use the form of my grandma like that? I was so angry. 

The odd thing is, before she even died, years before, I had another dream while staying with her for a while. The short version of that story was as I approached her from behind, she split in two and as I caught her, I noticed that the second "her" that fell to the floor was evil and her face was twisted. But nothing else happened until now.

I knew I had to post my story to find some answers.
