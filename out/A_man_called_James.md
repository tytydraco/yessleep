it all started when i was walking down the street.

i saw a man, tall and slender. he walked up to me and said:

'ze zitten achter je aan' which translates too: they're after you

i looked at him and said 'what?' he replied by saying, 'you will understand soon enough.'

when i got home i went immediately to sleep. i dreamed about a man called james searching for me, in a room like the backrooms but the place had a red misty type of fog. i remember it clearly. when he finally found me, he said 'this is a warning and preview of what you will endure' before choking me, and the dream ended.

when i awoke i got up and browsed the internet for a bit (this was at about 3:30) and found a video i couldn't not see. it was a story of a murder called james who had been arrested for life. he eventually died in that prison. i have no idea why i watched this at that time, but i eventually forgot about that video and went to sleep. i keep searching for that video but i cant find it. so anyway, when i went to sleep i dreamed about the man called james again. this time the dream was set up like an interveiw but without any cameras. he told me he was dutch and before the dream ended he said, 'does it all make sense now?' i woke up and the time was 7:16, which is interesting because if clocks went past 60 it would say 6:66. when i woke up then, i realized the man i spoke to wasnt even alive. i also remembered later in the day, that in the dream, he had said something similar to an idea of 'i seek revenge on humanity for what it has done to me and my friends. i must collect the souls of men to have our plans work out. you seem to have a special soul more interesting than the ones ive heard of.'

it was at that moment i realized that maybe when he is saying 'they' he may be refering to his friends, and maybe he wants my soul before they can get me. i was terrified. i didnt know why he needed souls to have revenge on people but maybe it was something i didnt see.

i then felt something within me. it said, 'you are stronger than this, you just dont understand yet.'

i then found an ability i didnt know could even be possible, let alone be used on-command.

i could come out of my physical body and float around, and i could even basically teleport anywhere. i then realized i could see other souls too. i saw my soul body as a purple color and the rest of the souls as a yellow color. i could move objects with my mind and even decide to become visible to the human's  eye. i realized i could control my physical body while being a floating soul. like i could study for tests while exploring mount everest and other things like that.

i then saw another soul that happened to be James. he spoke to me. (i see its worth mentioning i wasnt scared when i came out of my physical mind) and said, 'i need your soul for its power. you have immense ability i must have.'

at that moment it all made sense.

they wanted to use my powers to terrorize/terrify people into doing what they want before killing them, so they could use combined power to be strong enough to become alive again.

i then felt a sudden feeling of power i had never felt before. i was stronger than them and no one exactly realized it. i could bend the human's perception of objects and time and maybe other things.

basically, i was the scariest and most interesting ghost i had heard of.

it was like a lucid dream but i could control exactly "everything"

i then absorbed the powers of james and his friends, and realized i could do very interesting things.

things like see into the near future and warn people of upcoming events. travel across the world and animate my body into a human state and disappear and stuff. (like james did when i first saw him)

when i animate my human body like that, i could do anything. stand on mount everest and chose to feel or not feel the cold. i could become friends with someone in another country and perhaps tell them im a ghost and show them cool tricks. i could make many duplicates of myself instead of just one duplicate, and spend time in different places at the same time.
