I imagined all of the hands it must’ve passed through over the years, but wasn’t surprised because Sam, the owner of Bristol Market, hadn’t thrown anything away since the place opened in the 80s. 

I was on the late shift, all by myself in a part convenient store part gas station out in the middle of nowhere Tennessee. Hills covered in a cobalt blue moonlight were the only thing to accompany me. 

No yellow headlights. No families scurrying to refuel for their vacation destinations, their little ones scraping their stuffed animals against  the oily, paved road. That crowd was gone. All I had was a hope and a prayer that I wouldn’t meet what haunted my imagination. 
 
I sat at one of the dining tables, resting my head on my arms while gazing out the black window next to me. 

Before I could blink- THUNK! The glass shook in my face. 

I fell out of the booth onto the floor, my heart pounding. I searched for air, my eyes slowly focusing on the new crack in the window. 

I scrunched my brow. “Damn crow,” I said, standing to my feet. Still searching for breath, I faced my reflection, then bid it goodnight with pastel yellow curtains. 

I sighed and looked at the creaky, hardwood floors, making a beat with my foot on one of the loose boards. I glanced at the clock. Thirty minutes into shift. The entire night to go. 

To pass the time, and to keep my mind off of  the stabbing black void outside, I decided to stock the shelves. I organized all of the Three Musketeers bars into piles, except of course for one that went into my mouth. 

As I was reading the label on the wrapper, something flinched at the corner of my eye. I looked at the few rows in front of me, and I was certain whatever it was was grey,  had a round head, and had been glaring right at me. 

I listened in silence, my eyes darting to all corners of the room. 

“Hello?” I turned the corner and looked down another isle. Stacked bottles of coke fell over on the opposite side of the room. 

I sprint down another aisle, leapt over the mini staircase into Sam’s office, and locked the door. Sitting against it, I took out my cell phone and called Sam. 

It didn’t ring- no service. 

I grabbed the landline and dialed Sam’s number. He answered in an expected way. “Girl, why you callin’ me a’tis hour? You know better than to…”

“Sam, just listen for one second. There’s someone in the store… with me,” I said, remembering to breathe. 

“Good. Let let them know about our discounted shelf,” he said. 

“No. I’m not talking about a customer. There’s something in here that’s.. not human. I don’t know what it is. I need you to come get me,” I said, holding the phone skin tight to my face. 

I heard Sam turn over in his bed. “Ah, there ain’t nothin’ out to get you girl. I bet it’s one dem roof rats. I’ve been meanin’ to trim back those trees that hang over the store.” 

I sat in thought. “Roof rats?” 

“Yep. How about you go check it out and if you see somethin’ you ain’t sure about again, call the police.” 

“They’re forty five minutes out at least. They’d never be able to help me,” I whispered, listening for potential noises on the other side of the door. 

“Fine. Call me back then if you need to. But I can’t promise I’ll answer,” Sam said. 

Click. 

“Sam?” 

I hung up the phone, it’s echo of a faint ring stinging my nerves. I cracked open the door, peeked through, and after deciding I was alone, I walked down the stairs into the quiet, lonely space. 

I scanned the store, then glanced out through the front door at the dimly lit gas pumps. Hugging my sweater, I gulped. 

Just relax, I thought. There’s no one here but me. There’s no one here but me.  

Then, just behind the register, the hardwoods creaked.
