Hey guys, I really need to share this with you all... Honestly, I’m not even sure how to start, but something’s been haunting me for the past few days, and I don’t mean just online. I think I got hacked—or maybe it’s something worse? Idk. I’m starting to feel like I’m losing it here.

It all started with a mistake, a childish ideal to enable DMZ on my router just for online game instead of port forward. For those who don’t know, DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) basically opens up your device to the internet without the usual protections from your router’s firewall. It’s supposed to help with smoother connections, especially for gaming, but it leaves your system vulnerable to attacks. I thought it would just make my P2P game with some strangers across the world run smooth (It did)... but it was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made online.

The next part might be because of some shady cloud storage app I installed the other night, something that immediately set off warning bells. I uninstalled it almost quickly as it popped some weird adulty ads. it, but I suspect the damage was already done.

I’ve always been careless with security. In the real world, I don’t even lock my house properly - just the main gate, because that’s always been “good enough” for me with CCTVs around my house. But looking back now, I see how my *small* negligence turned into a lingering eerily feeling.

The first wave hit hard. My Facebook accounts were linked to some spam IG, through Meta*,* I don't even have my own IG. By the time I realized what was happening, Meta took down my entire account. It was too late to save anything.

The second wave came the following night. I was asleep when a Discord notification jolted me awake. It was official, a suspension alert. In a panic, I scrambled to change my passwords and activate 2FA, thinking I’d at least beaten them to the punch this time. 2FA went for every social account I use. But, some of the apps didn’t send me the SMS codes for 2FA, which forced me to choose phone calls OTP instead.

The automated voice was unsettling. The signal at my house is poor, so the voice on the other end was distorted, broken, eerie in a way I can’t quite explain. They repeated the OTP once. This time I managed to activate the 2FA for all account, or at least, I thought I did.

THIS TIME, MY REDDIT!

At first, I received an email from Reddit about suspicious activity on my account, urging me to change my password.

The account’s login history was bizarre. I live in Thailand, but there were logins from places like the USA and Singapore. I figured the hacker was using a VPN to mask their location. But that wasn’t even the worst part. They had added me to tons of subreddits, mostly NSFW. And they weren’t just lurking in the background - they were *active*, like a regular user. They were commenting, complimenting posts, upvoting NSFW content, and downvoting random NSFW things I’d never touch. They even *hid* random some post. It felt like they were impersonating me, turning my account into their personal playground.

I didn’t think much of it at the time (Oh god, I spent 30-50 min to check what hacker did...). So I went ahead and changed the password, thinking that would be the end of it.

But then Reddit started acting weird, some random saved posts, upvotes, appeared TWICE (the content is about a self-promotion of some service, not sure if it was cable tv or isp, but surely not NFSW). I already DID 2FA for this account too, and things seemed to settle for a bit. I had regained control. But I was wrong somehow. I hope it was a pure technical issue from the system, like that the post has been hidden and shown up. So it appeared in my Profile.

It was last night—Saturday, 08.08.2024—when things truly spiraled out of control. I received another phone call from foreign country code. I was deep into a game, wearing my headphones, and had to take them off to answer the call. When I did, there was nothing but silence on the other end. *Nothing*.

Annoyed, I tossed my phone aside and put my headphones back on. And then, I heard it. A knock, twice, heavy knock on my wooden door, my bedroom.

But I live alone.

I immediately pulled off my headphones and walked around to scan the house. Silence.

The dog, usually so protective, had retreated into his house and refused to come out, even when I called for him. I checked every corner of 1F. From the bedroom to the living room, the kitchen to the yard—nothing was out of place. No signs of anyone entering. And yet, I felt watched, exposed.

I didn’t dare go upstairs. I haven’t been to the second or third floor in ages—they’re dark and unused. Something about those floors feels off, like they’re waiting for me to make a mistake.

Since then, strange things keep happening. Random knocks at the door, the sound of wooden furniture shifting, like a chair scraping the floor, always when I’m wearing my headphones. But every time I check the CCTV, there’s nothing there. Just me, alone in my house, or so it seems.

Now, I stick to using speakers instead of headphones. The sounds have stopped for the moment, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is watching, waiting. If it happens again, I’ll at least be able to tell if it’s coming from my PC... a funny virus, maybe, or something far worse.

**PLEASE take my advice:** always use 2FA, different passwords for every account, and if you’re lazy like me, at least make them unique. Something like “YourPasswordReddiiit” for Reddit, or “YourPasswordGEmail” for Gmail. It’s the simplest form of protection, but sometimes, it’s all that stands between you and a breach that could spiral out of control.

And for the love of everything, don’t leave your router in DMZ mode without decent protection and a really good reason to leave it enable. Every day, my newly installed antivirus blocks port scans—imagine if it didn’t. Imagine if I hadn’t activated that firewall in time. The attacks are constant, and if your system’s outdated, you might never know what hit you until it’s too late.

But it’s not just about your digital security, can’t ignore the physical world either. What’s the point of obsessing over online safety if some *real* windows or even doors are unlocked, like mine were? Especially when having unused rooms or closed-off areas in the house. It’s an open invitation for more than just hackers...

Lock your doors. Lock *everything*.

And listen closely, especially when the phone rings late at night.
