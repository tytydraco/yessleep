You can read the first and second part of my bizarre experiences in the small town of Kinsley when I was visiting with my boyfriend Nick here:

A child dressed in a pretty pink flowery dress ran up to me in a green field, blue waves crashing behind me. As she drew closer, I realised she has a small bright orange bird beak where her nose and mouth should be. She opened the beak and cawed very loudly, up into my face.

I screamed. The girl cawed “Help! “ I took a step back and fell down towards the ocean.

I opened my eyes.

I was on the bed in the bedroom Violet had showed me to. But the nightmare was continuing.

A large black feathered beaked face pushed itself into me.

I screamed again, a continuation of the nightmare scream.

Nick pulled off the bird mask, laughing. “Oh my god Lucille, the look on your face! It’s just a silly mask- look, I made it when I was a child!”

A wave of anger surged in me, and I thought I would explode from sheer emotion. But some hidden survival instinct kept me calm. Instead, I smiled at Nick and said brightly “That’s pretty neat actually! People here are so creative, I had no idea!”

Nick looked at me silently for moment, his hands busily stroking the black feathers.

Then he returned my smile. “Oh Lucille!” he said, the relief palpable in his voice. “I’m so glad you appreciate it! Outsiders have no idea you know- the talent and the energy here in Kinsley- on the peninsula. And you know what- it’s crazy, but the pandemic really brought it out. I was in my last year of high school you know, so I helped my Aunt Margaret and others with the homeschooling, we used to say the pandemic was the best thing that had happened to us! So much artistry, so much communion with nature, little kids talking to the crows, the scarecrows… “ his voice trailed off.

I said nothing. He picked up again. “And then my dad died, and Aunt Margaret, and Craig was just too much,I felt I had to get away, you know, I was feeling overwhelmed- and my mom supported me to get off the peninsula even though the others didn’t want me to-”

I prompted gently “Your mom sounds amazing!”

He said eagerly “Oh she is, she is- you have no idea!” His voice brightened up as he continued, “Let’s go down- she’s made the most beautiful supper for us!”

The rest of the evening passed smoothly enough. Nick was his usual loving self, and Violet was charming. We ate together, and helped with the chores, and even played a round of rummy. Then Violet went to bed, and we too turned in shortly afterwards. We made love, and I forgot all my worries and anxieties in the deep delight of true love. Afterwards I fell into an excellent sleep.

In the morning, I woke up to an empty bed. I went down, where Violet laughed at me “Good morning sleepyhead. Nick already went to town to catch up with his old friends- I’m sure if you follow you’ll run into him at the coffee shop or antique store!”

Despite her friendliness, I sensed she wanted me out of her way, and so I said I’d go look for him and grab breakfast in town. I texted him but my message remained unread.

I felt more accustomed to the town’s vibes now, and seeing the children crouched in corners by decorated poles, some dressed up in black feathers and wings but some not didn’t bother me. Some of them “pecked” at the ground, pretending to eat while others ran around flapping their black wings. I smiled at them and hurried, eager to see Nick and feeling hungry. I sent him another text.

A girl bumped into me - I thought I recognized her from the day before. She didn’t have the beak and crow-costume on. I smiled at her, and she said “You’re Nick’s girlfriend from off the peninsula aren’t you?”

“Yes”, I replied. “And you’re Louisa, right? You’re not wearing your costume today?”

“I hate the stupid mask and costume! I can’t breathe when I’m masked!” she said, angrily.

I was surprised. “Well, I’m sure you don’t have to wear it, right? Or maybe just wear the wings and not the beaks?”

She frowned. “Everyone has to wear masks, or we’ll kill the old ones, and then die ourselves. Didn’t they tell you that? Didn’t you have to wear masks off the peninsula? They told us everyone in world had to!”

I shook my head, the feeling of helpless confusion coming over me again. I said cautiously “I meant the bird masks. Are you talking about the pandemic? The pandemic is over.”

Louisa opened her eyes wide at me. Then suddenly her expression changed to pure terror. She cried out “No! No no no”- and rushed past me.

I looked back. Craig was standing in the middle of the street, holding a cat high by its scruff.

“I caught this one attacking the crows Louisa. That won’t do you know. We can’t have that here. It has to go” he cried

Louisa screamed loudly and people began gathering round. The cat was a beautiful big golden tabby, its fur glowing in the morning sun. It kept quite still. “Craig!” screamed Louisa. “Please no, I’ll keep her indoors. Don’t harm her- give her to me!” she reached up for her tabby.

A man held Louisa back. “If it attacked crows, on Festival day, that’s bad Louisa. Let Craig do what he does, and protect them. You can get another cat.” Another cried “Back off Louisa!”

Craig raised his other hand to the tabby’s neck.

Without thinking, I ran forward, my handbag raised, and hit him square in his chest.

The blow took him by surprise. He staggered back, and dropped the cat. Louisa scooped her up and ran off. The crowd parted for her. Craig squared up to me.

“Why you fancy city-slut- how dare-” he raised his hand. I looked around. The crowd seemed to have vanished- the street was empty.

I shrank back, waiting for the blow. I knew there was no use in running- where would I run to?

“Lucille- Craig- what’s going on?” Nick ran out of a shop.

Craig dropped his hand. “Nick- what the hell were you thinking, bringing her here?” he cried. “She interrupted me- you know she can’t do that- she doesn’t understand our ways.”

Nick stared at him. “Craig- are you still into that old stuff with crows? Let it drop cousin- the pandemic is over!”

Craig strode towards him. “Corvid is not over! My mother is dead, Nick, and your father too! What is wrong with you! The crows are here- they need their sacrifice!” he screamed.

I stared at the two men squaring up to each other in horror and began shrinking back into a crevice between two buildings, as I noticed people coming back into the street. I heard their mutters. “He’s right Nick”. “That’s what the townies say, but we know better.” “Corvid isn’t over”. “You got to protect them Nick.” “They need their sacrifice” “You’re worse than she is- she’s just ignorant, but you know better.”

I stepped back deeper into the crevice and crouched behind a garbage bin.

And from there I watched, as in slow motion, the town people led by Craig overpower Nick and take him away.

It happened so fast. Within minutes, the street was empty, the shops shuttered. I stepped out of my hiding place, and tears streaming down my face, ran back towards Nick’s house- not knowing what to do or whether I should even tell Violet.
