The Hillview Conservatory has been the sole art restoration initiative in our state ever since I've moved here. Essentially the only place that even remotely cares about art in our middle-of-nowhere town. You would think that not much happens here with the town being far removed from all the places with art that's actually worth restoring. Well surprisingly, they just launched a new branch for art restoration... The fucking AI restoration division. yaaaay.

I remember hearing about the division being pitched in my first week there. It was from two tech bros that just came back after their failed AI venture. They didnt develop their learning model, they really just bought a subscription and thought they could pass off anything from it as their own. When the generative models were coming around, they pitched to the conservatory that they could use it for the pieces that were missing certain parts to it, that they could revive what was lost.

Now idk if I'm being pretentious about this, but I think that the reason we're even preserving art is to bring a piece to its best condition, not to add anything that was already lost to time. Because if we start adding stuff back on to it, that changes the piece and its not the original artist's work anymore. The original message gets skewed by whatever was added and the story of how it came to be here is gone.

I'm getting ahead of myself. But I feel like I have to emphasize this because my distaste for their AI restoration program resonated twice as much when they announced that the first thing they were restoring was the towns oldest heritage piece, The Hill's Eye. It's one thing to sully an artist's work, but tampering with a fucking cultural monument?!?!? Are we the fucking British Museum over here??!?!

The Hill's eye is a large rectangular stone that was dated all the way back before any settlers or colonizers set foot here. It was always talked about like our own stone henge but its biggest distinctor is the marking on top that's been interpreted as an eye. It also had traces of other markings across its side but erosion and time erased most of it. So, I guess they saw it as a prime candidate for their "nEw TeChnoLogY." They did one pass of surface scanning on the stone and then they just put each side in the generative AI program to fill out the fucking inscriptions.

As pissed as I am about them tampering with the Hill's Eye, I also hate admitting that its what started getting more people to visit the conservatory. It was the most people I'd seen there and they're cheering for the reveal of their own bastardized monument. And not just that, looking at the "restored" monument myself, it really just looks like they took whatever symbol was already there and repeated it till each side was full. It's so stupid.

The unveiling of the new Hill's Eye was 2 weeks ago. People are still travelling from all over just to see it, so it was easy to overlook everything else in the conservatory. Now this is why I felt I had to share this story because I noticed the other pieces started changing.

The first one that I noticed was the signature. I was doing inventory checks on the pieces that weren't up for display yet and I saw that a bunch of them had a recurring signature. I knew for sure these were from different artists but the same sign kept showing up. The symbol looked like one of the markings on the Hill's Eye.

After noting the inventory, I checked the displays to see if anything else was tampered with. Funnily enough, I saw the same signature make it to some of the displayed pieces too. But when I got to one of the painting rooms, I saw that some of the hands on the portraits were getting extra fingers. I... I don't know what to make of it; if the AI department is fucking with the display pieces too or I'm just losing it. There were definitely more fingers on their hands and they weren't far from the style of the paintings they were on too, and it made it more unsettling for me.

Another recurring change was in the landscape pieces. Some of them had black rectangular silhouettes in the landscape. There's no detail on it, just an ominous black rectangle. I'm getting a hunch this is what messing with an ancient monument gets you but I've been keeping track of all these changes and it was getting out of hand. How did no one else noticed these in the last week?

This was so many infractions to report in one room alone so I just wanted to clock out and not deal with having to explain any of this to a supervisor on the same night. As I was on my way out, I suddenly felt an unshakeable stare from the room. As I froze, I felt more eyes staring one by one. I was also closing up so no one else was there. The portrait paintings hang on the sides of the room, but you know the illusion of how their eyes still follow you as you walk along? I dont know I've never been that offput by them, especially after interning here for like 3 months, but the stares just felt so strong that night and they felt... So real. When I finally got back some courage to keep walking out, I took one last glance back into the room. 

I saw the portraits heads fully facing me at the door. Their elongated necks stretching off their frames with their heads floating and warped with their eyes fully opened. Their eyes were like full white circles with single dot pupils, just staring into my soul.

I shut the door so fast and booked it. I've already had enough of that building with what they were doing and I just got probably the best reason to not be there anymore. It was my last day so I got my full credits for interning but I didn't get to file the report with all the weird things I found. Maybe that division could face some actual consequences for what they did defacing that monument.

So if any of you are planning to go to The Hillview Conservatory anytime soon, It's not worth the gas or your time. And if anyone reading is working at Hillview right now, I suggest you file that two week notice asap.
