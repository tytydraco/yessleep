So,I am a teen who really enjoys classic things.Cars,music,video games,movies etc

Anyway,I was scrolling though prime video last night when I came across a sitcom that I never heard of before.

The name of the show was called something like "A loving family on the outside" or something like that.

Judging by the quality and style of the show,it looked like it was from the 90's or late 80's,which are my favorite kind of shows.

I decided to give it a watch to see if it was any good.It had a decent rating according to the app.

The main characters consisted of a mother and her 3 sons living in a nice medium sized home.

The mother was fairly older and looked to be in her mid 50's, while her oldest son looked in to be in his early to mid 20's and was fairly handsome.

The other 2 sons were in there mid to late teens.I only assume that because one episode focused on them in high school

The middle son seemed to be more into theater and the youngest son was a athlete 

There was no father figure seen or mentioned one time in any episode I watched either which was weird as it clearly was an older show.

I do not think any name was mentioned once in the show.The mom was only referred to as mom and the son's were only called son by her.

The brothers only called each other names like "Bro,dude,buddy,man" in each episode.Which was odd.

Anyway.The show was your typical sitcom.One episode focused on the youngest son getting caught drinking with friends 

 And after learning about the dangers of drinking after a friend of his crashes his dad's car,pledges to never do it again.

Another focused on the oldest son,finally going on dates with women instead of being a workaholic(he worked in a factory btw).

It all ended hilariously bad for him though, as all of the women he took on dates ended up being either too naive, or crazy to him in funny ways

One scene involved a crazy woman on a date with him,getting on the table and throwing food around because she didn't like it.

The show was fairly good and funny for the first few episodes but it suddenly took a dark turn in the last episode which is why I am here.

It started off normal enough,the mother is upset about aging and tries on all different kinds of make up to look younger .

She even has a skin reaction to ine brand of make up and is embarrassed by the rash she gets and walls around with a towel around her face for a bit

She even made excuse as to why she was doing that when her kids would ask her.I won't say what she said as it wouldn't fly today but it did then.

The side plot deals with the middle son helping  a friend who just got dumped by his girlfriend cheer up by taking his mind off of her.

The oldest and youngest son were absent from this part of the episode entirely and were not mentioned at all by the mom or other son once.

Towards the end of the episode,the mom is sitting in a chair all alone and rubbing her face (now healed) and humming to herself.

This went on for almost 2 minutes and I was getting creeped out by it and was about to turn off my TV.

Suddenly,the mom stopped humming and looked straight toward at the camera as if she knew what I was about to do

She then started smiling in a weird way and her eyes began to change.

They went from normal light brown eyes to  completely black with what appeared to be many stars forming in them .

 Her face was frozen with  that same pearly white smile ,without moving or saying a word.

The camera then slowly zoomed towards those horrifying eyes until it looked like the camera was in outer space.

It was dead silent for a moment until finally the camera faded to black for a few seconds.

It then cut to a new scene when the oldest son was laying in bed asleep as if he was having a nightmare.

He tossed and turned before springing  up in bed and gasping for air.

Thankfully his eyes were normal which I was thankful for.But that didn't last long.

He then began to speak directly towards the camera...or me?

What he said chilled me to the core.

*Dark events are coming to the world soon.Towers will fall,manipulative evil people will take over every free nation until none remain.Civil wars will become common and  normal.One day the whole world will be covered in flames until we are all nothing but ashes*

He then reached for a bottle of pills on a deal by his bed and took the whole bottle of them at once and began foaming at the mouth and convulsing before becoming motionless in his bed

The camera slowly moved to the other side of the room to reveal his crazy date laying dead on the floor with a slit throat,her face stuck in a horrified state.


The screen faded to black again and then cut to a new scene with the youngest son entering his school with a very big back pack.

Yeah...you can assume what happened next.My mouth dropped to the floor when he started opening fire on everyone he saw.

The side characters screamed and begged to be spared as he gunned them down,with that same creepy smile that his mother had earlier.

All of the victims truly looked dead.Bloody corpses laid all around him .Many were missing limbs.Some were still taking last gasp for air.


The youngest son walked around several dead bodies and giggled to himself,admiring his work.I jumped when I heard his phone start to ring.

He answered it but he didn't do anything but smile and there was no voice coming from the other end.

This went on for a full 30 seconds and I would have assumed the show froze if it were not for him blinking a few times.

He then hung up the phone,put it in his pocket and then looked towards something off screen as police sirens were heard in the distance

The boy then broke the 4th wall like his mom and brother did earlier and looked at the camera,winked and turned his gun on himself

His head exploded into bits .The camera zoomed in on his now headless body .


I felt like I had to puke my guts out at this rate but something kept me glued to my chair.


The show then jumped to a new scene with the middle son sitting with his friend who was dumped by his girlfriend sitting on a bridge above a fast moving river.

The middle son puts his hand on his sobbing friends back and leans in close to his friend  and whispers something  in his ear

The friend looks shocked at whatever the middle son said to him and without hesitation,jumps off of the bridge into the water below.

The middle son starts to laugh as a new female character walks into the shot (I assume the other guys ex gf) and they embraced and kissed.


The son then grabs her by the hair as she is shocked and begans to scream and struggle to no avail ,as he calls her a whore and tosses her over the bridge 


He looks at the camera,like his other family members had earlier,and broke the 4th wall himself.

*People are so quick to trust others without a second thought these days huh*

He then laughed to himself before jumping into the river below,still laughing.


The final scene looked grainy but it clearly was the family living room...with what looked like the mom hanging from a  rope around her neck from the celing fan.


It went on for a solid minute before the show finally ended.

As if a trance had left my body,I began to cry as I fell to the ground for what felt like hours.

I finally gathered myself and took a hot shower to try to forget about that show.

I went to bed last night and had awful nightmares about that family just watching me sleep with creepy smiles on their faces

When I asked a few friends about if they had any clue about that show,they were clueless

I googled it...nothing came up.Its not even on prime anymore .

I KNOW it was real.

Please someone...please tell me you know what this show is

I am beyond scared
