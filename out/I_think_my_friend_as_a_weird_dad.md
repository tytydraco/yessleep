Apologies if this is incoherent. This is more of a vent post than anything. My friend and I were talking on the way back from a trip we took with our kids. We started chatting about the old days when we were kids ourselves just messing around in rural Arkansas. Some things struck me as odd in our stories now that I’m an adult. My friend, I’ll just call him ‘J’, disagrees though. I wanted to see which side you guys will take. I suppose I can start with the story that caused this disagreement to begin with.

 



In the early 2000’s, J and I lived in the Ozark area. Middle of nowhere, dusty ass mountain town. He and I were on the football team at middle school. That’s how we met, actually. His mom and my mom got to chitchatting when they saw us messing around after practice one day and we had this arrangement where we’d watch J until she can pick him up.



We spent plenty of afternoons trying to get through Ocarina of Time. Neither us understood the water temple so we thought we had to restart the game every time we got stuck. One particular afternoon drifted into the early evening and J’s mom only showed up after my mom called her. When she showed up to our house, J’s mom’s bright blue eyes had these dark circles under them. Her entire arm was shivering when she reached out for J.



J didn’t seem to want to go, we just got halfway through the Goron cave again and he really didn’t want to have to redo it all. But she grabbed his wrist and pulled him towards the new red F-150 idling in our gravel driveway. The license plate was still that paper one the dealer gives you.



My mom muttered to my stepdad something about it being odd his family keeps getting new vehicles. My stepdad silently nodded as J’s family’s truck disappeared onto the country round. I just parroted the same line I heard from J when I asked about it,



“J’s dad owns a construction company. It’s for his company!”



I remember mom just smiling and nodding.

 

I think it was later that semester when we had a ‘team building exercise’ during football practice after school. We were supposed to roll a log up a hill. That’s it. That’s the whole exercise. Looking back on it, I’m pretty sure it was just to relocate a powerline that fell.



J had a hard time keeping up with the rest of us and got his arm caught under the log as it rolled uphill. Nobody noticed his body was thrown into the air. It was his flailing legs that caught the attention of the coach.



Coach H called  J’s mom. While she was on her way, Coach H instructed us on how to get the log off J’s arm. I still remember how bent out of shape it was when we finally freed the kid. J wasn’t screaming or crying like I thought he would. Instead he was just… sitting there.



A blue F-150 pulled into the driveway and J’s big dad got out. He grab J and half-dragged him back to the truck muttering something like ‘dumbass kid’ under his breath. The rest of us went back to our log and pushed on it like we were told to. We were careful to not get our arms caught under it.

 



J wasn’t back at school for a few days. I remember asking the nurse about him, assuming she’d know how he’s doing. She seemed surprised an injury happened during football practice because she was never told.  I told her what happened, but she quickly told me to leave the office as she picked up her desk phone.



When J got back, he had a bright blue cast with signatures from a bunch of people I was certain didn’t go to our school. I signed his elbow before someone takes the good spot. The teachers refused to sign his cast, even when asked by J himself.



Even though he was injured J stayed for football practice. He’d just sit on the sidelines and hand me my water bottle between sessions of Kenny throwing me to the ground. While I was getting into position for our last practice play of the day I noticed a new green F-150 pulled into the parking lot. A blonde woman sits in the driver’s seat. I could have sworn she was crying.



Before my ears could finish ringing from the heavy hit I took, J’s bright blonde hair pops into view. His crooked smile blocked out of the sun as he told me that I get to hang out at his place today.



On the way to J’s house his mom told me that my step-dad and my mom were stuck at work. That wasn’t uncommon since they both worked very much out of town. J and I spoke about Lord knows what the entire way back, his mom silently driving down the country roads.



J lived in a double wide trailer in a small trailer park just out of town. His gravel parking space had two identical F-150s parked in it, along with a third parked in the grass. J’s mom had us hop out while she pulled down the street to park. J excitedly rushed towards the house saying something about his dad being home. Through the window I could see J’s dad’s ice blue eyes staring out at us.



He, along with several of his construction employees, huddle around a folding table. J’s dad’s lips curl into a grin and he waves to us. The others wave at us too, greeting both J and I. J reached for the nob before his mom shoo’d him back towards the gravel road. She told us to leave J’s dad to work.



We didn’t mind, though.



There were a couple girls down the street we had a crush on. Sisters named Emily and Mikayla. We invited them out to go ride dirt bikes in the field behind J’s house.



 As the sun went down, J, the two girls, Emily and Mikayla, and I went back to J’s house. Emily lingered on the porch for way too long. She kept peering at someone through the window. I remember Mikayla just pushed through the door right alongside J. I greeted the small group of men huddled around a plastic folding table and they waved back.



A few giving us friendly smiles before looking back at whatever construction plans they were working on. They had to plan their concrete pours for the next day. We didn’t want to be a bother (and J wanted to flirt with Emily some more) but J’s dad stopped us as we walked down the hallway towards his room.



I still remember his ice blue eyes staring into my soul,



 “Do not go back there, boys. We are fixing a leak.”



J shrugged and shuffled to the living room TV. Mikayla sat on the floor beside him and they spoke on what movie to watch. I could have sworn I heard a dog shuffling in the room beyond. Like paws scratching at the Linoleum flooring. Emily finally came in, nervously eyeing one of the construction workers. She sat all too close to, dang near leaning on me.



J’s dad called out,



 “Look who has a girlfriend!”



Emily only grabbed onto my arm harder. By the time my parents came to pick me up, J’s dad and a couple of his employees went to go try to fix the leak or whatever. The rest left in their trucks. Even Emily and Mikayla went home. I was telling my mom about my night and she reminded me of something I didn’t even consider; J's family didn’t have a dog.

 



J says he thinks he remembers that story. He didn’t want to talk about it in front of his kid, though. I just thought those couple weeks were kind of odd. I have a few more weird stories about J’s dad but I’m really tired. I have to get to bed soon. I wish I could sleep but the neighbor won’t turn off his damn headlights. Those new truck LEDs are freaking blinding. Anyway, let me know if you guys want any more stories. I’m sure I have them.
