Hi, this is my first attempt at writing and posting a creepypasta story. If you feel like it, let me know what you think in the comments. Any feedback about the story and writing itself is greatly appreciated. English is not my first language, so that is another aspect to writing I want to improve at. You will also stumble upon some dark humour in this story, as well as in my future work (if I ever decide post again), that may not be funny to everyone. I assure you however, it is only satire, my friends and I just have a fucked up sense of humour. Enjoy.  

... 

Do you ever get that weird feeling like you’re being watched? Like you are not alone? Like someone... or someTHING... is out there? Usually, it’s just that, a feeling. You look around and quickly see a familiar, friendly face waving at you. But what about that similar feeling, with shivers running down your spine, with a small voice in your head telling you that something is off. Telling you that, when you look around, you are not going to see a friendly face. 

...  

It was sometime between seven and eight in the evening and, since it was winter, it was already dark outside. I was at the gym in Ljubljana with two of my closest friends. Clever fit in Situla. That was probably my favourite gym. Since they opened another Clever fit gym in Bežigrad the one in Situla usually wasn’t too busy, the equipment was in good condition and there was plenty of space. On that day however, it was pretty crowded. After arriving and meeting out front, we entered through the main entrance, scanned our RFID bracelets and looked around.    
“A lot of people.” I said. “What do we hit first?”    
“A woman.” Tim answered my question with no hesitation.    
We looked at him with a slight smile and look in our eyes that said, there was something wrong with him.    
“A g\*psy?” Tim broke the five seconds long pause.   
“We need to find a girl with the biggest and sweatiest ass and just follow her.” We looked at Denis with confusion and laughed.   
Suddenly I got that creepy feeling I spoke about in the beginning. I felt like someone was watching me and that it wasn’t just a cute girl checking me out from across the room.    
“What’s wrong with you?” Denis asked after noticing I’d stopped following them towards the changing room and seeing the weird expression on my face.   
“Ehh nothing.”    
I chose to ignore it. I had gotten that weird feeling quite often recently. Ever since that night when I couldn’t sleep and decided to go for a walk. 

I woke up suddenly, all sweaty, from a weird dream that... I couldn’t really remember. All I could recall were some freakishly long, pale arms and fingers. The fingers were grotesquely pointy. There was also another thing I could not get out of my head for days. A fedora. It looked... normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. But there was this weird feeling that accompanied it. The more I thought about the hat, the more uneasy I felt. I tried to fall back asleep but couldn’t. So, I got dressed, put on some shoes and went for a walk before it was time to leave for work. It was around two am so I had about three hours until my alarm clock was supposed to ring. I didn’t get far before I got that same uncomfortable feeling. I stopped and looked around. Where I was standing, was the beginning of a very badly lit park. Because I could not make out anything out of the ordinary anywhere around me, I kept going. Just... on higher alert. There was no rational reason for me to worry, at least from what I could see or hear, but I also did not want to ignore my instincts, so I decided to take a turn towards the main street with more traffic. Well. As much traffic as you can get in the middle of the night. I returned to the apartment at around 0330 hour, had a normal breakfast for once, drank a cup of coffee, showered and drove to work. Even though I had gotten that feeling again, time to time, I didn’t think much of it. I sort of got used to it and wrote it off as a probable stress side effect. Until that evening. The evening, I went to the gym with Tim and Denis.  

We changed into our sportswear, locked our bags into lockers and stepped back out of the changing room. We took just a couple of steps looking around and trying to make a workout plan based on unoccupied equipment. That is when I felt it again. The feeling of being watched. The shivers. The goosebumps and the hair standing up on the back of my neck. This was the shortest amount of time between two separate incidents until now, not to mention this one was by far the more intense I have ever felt. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I looked around with a look that probably resembled that of a deer in front of a pair of headlights, if the deer was also pretty annoyed at this point.    
This time it did not take me long to find him. I just started staring, I could not look away. The awful feeling got even worse. And the man... the... thing... was staring right back at me. Even though I had never seen him before, I immediately recognised him by the long, thin arms and fingers... and the fedora. He was tall, wearing a dark grey woollen coat, his arms were as grotesquely long, like were his fingers, as in my dream. I couldn’t even see the end of his long, pale pointy fingers through the crowd from across the gym. Even though he was on the other side of the gym, it was like he was right in front of me, a meter (about three feet) away. I could clearly see the buttons on his coat, the long, slender, unnaturally pale neck leading up to... the face...   
The face had only one really noticeable feature. A long thin slit across, that I could only assume, was his mouth. It went from where one ear was supposed to be, to where the other one was also missing. I couldn’t even see the eyes from under the fedora, but I could feel his... or its... look. I was staring at the fedora, I got dizzy, the room started to spin slightly and everything else in my vision around the entity got blurry. Must've been seconds, but it felt like hours to me before I could finally get a sentence out of my mouth.   
“Are you guys seeing this?” I stuttered quietly without breaking eye contact.    
Tim slowly leaned towards me looking in the same direction.   
“Black people, am I right?”   
“What?”   
“What?”   
I looked at Tim with a confused look and as I turned back, the entity was gone. I noticed a large, muscular black man, roughly in the same direction. He was bench pressing the weight of a small car.   
“That one would’ve been pretty expensive back in the day.” Tim added.   
“You’re telling me you didn’t see the guy in the coat.”   
“Nope.”   
“What are you guys doing?” Asked Denis as he stepped closer to us.   
“Luka is watching dudes in coats.”    
“Gay.” Was Denis quick with his response.    
I let out a nervous laughter, as I still hadn’t completely shaken the dizziness, but genuinely found their comments funny, and told them to go fuck themselves. Denis then quickly informed me about the general lack of clothing of the female population and the appealing figures, as well as about his desired action, had he come into closer contact with one of the attractive females. I immediately wanted to erase that interaction from my memory.  

I was still shaken from the encounter with the materialization of my nightmare. I had a feeling this was not the last time that I had seen... or heard... of the creepy fedora. I had no idea, however, ... how right... I was.
