I stared at the door before me, its surface peeling like old skin. This wasn’t supposed to be here—I was sure of it. It hadn’t been on the blueprints. But old houses always have their secrets, don’t they? My curiosity gnawed at me until I couldn’t ignore it anymore. I reached for the knob, turned it, and stepped inside.

The air shifted instantly, sending a chill skittering down my spine. The room was empty. Completely empty, except for another door directly ahead. I turned back, expecting to see the way I’d come in, but my stomach dropped—the door I’d just stepped through was gone.

I froze, trying to make sense of what had just happened. “Alright… weird,” I muttered, trying to keep calm.

With no other choice, I approached the second door and opened it. The next room was smaller, just by a little. The walls felt closer, the ceiling a bit lower. Like the first room, it was empty, except for the door waiting at the far side.

I hesitated, but then I stepped through.

And again.

And again.

Each room was smaller than the last. At first, it was subtle—barely noticeable. But as I moved deeper, the walls started closing in. The ceiling lowered until I could feel it brushing against my hair. The air grew colder, thinner.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice bouncing hollowly off the shrinking walls.

Nothing. No response.

I turned to go back, but there was no way back. The doors behind me were gone. Only the next door ahead remained.

The rooms kept shrinking. The once-normal spaces became claustrophobic. I was crouching after a while, then crawling. The light dimmed to a faint, sickly glow, and my breaths grew shallow and panicked.

By the time I reached the last door, I could barely move. The walls scraped my shoulders, the ceiling pressed on my back. It felt like the house itself was trying to crush me. Somehow, I squeezed through the final opening. My chest was heaving. My heart thundered in my ears.

That’s when I saw it.

The room was the size of a coffin. And standing there, impossibly, was… me.

But it wasn’t me. Not really.

It had my face, my clothes, my build—but everything about it was wrong. Its eyes gleamed, too sharp, too bright. Its smile twisted unnaturally, stretching far too wide.

“You made it,” it said, its voice exactly like mine but colder, hollow. “I’ve been waiting.”

I tried to scream, to scramble backward, but the room was too small. The thing reached out and grabbed me, its fingers ice-cold and impossibly strong.

Before I could react, it yanked me forward. In a blur, I felt myself pulled into it. Or maybe it pulled itself into me. I couldn’t tell.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in the first room again. It was bigger now, back to normal. The doorway I’d come through had returned.

I stared down at my hands. They weren’t mine. The skin was pale, veined, foreign.

The door creaked open behind me.

A new figure stepped inside—a stranger, wide-eyed and curious, just like I had been.

I tried to scream, to warn them not to go any further, but my lips wouldn’t move. My body wasn’t mine anymore.

Instead, I smiled. That same grotesque, too-wide smile.

“Welcome,” I heard myself say.
