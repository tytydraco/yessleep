“We'll keep tabs on it. Anything else?” 

That’s the gist of what they all have said. By “they,” I’m referring to the various doctors I’ve seen over the years for my mental ailments. None have offered an explanation as to why reality blurs with the creations of my mind. Maybe it’s because I’m young and can’t possibly be going insane. Maybe the doctors don’t particularly care to fully help their hundredth depressed and anxious patient. Thankfully, trial-and-error has led to a lovely prescription cocktail that makes most of my issues manageable, but my hallucinations persist. 

All the anti-psychotics I’ve tried made my life worse; as if the figures I see are sentient enough to retaliate against my attempts to suppress them. My final try at one of those medications was a few weeks ago. I could feel an unfortunately familiar presence watching me as I shook yet another new pill into my hand. That night I woke up to the sound of my closet door creaking open. The drumming of my heartbeat pounded in my ears as blurred-together fingers slowly crept around the edge of the closet door, one by one, mimicking a spider’s legs.  

“I know I checked my closet,” I thought to myself while praying that the ghostly hand was all I’d see. Every night I check the corners of my apartment- under the table, behind the bathroom door- any place something or someone could hide while waiting for me to fall asleep. It's been my nighttime routine for a few years now. I feel especially childish when kneeling to peer under my bed. My paranoia over the years has led to keeping a baseball bat next to my bed, sometimes sleeping with it, clutched in my hands like a child with their teddy bear. Sleep has always been my rescuer, but I can’t help but wonder what happens while I’m unconscious.  

It’s a cycle of the same medical form with a different clinic name at the top, meeting with a new doctor who asks the same questions in their own way, mindlessly explaining my problems to them, and only getting their attention when I mention my hallucinations at the end of my playlist of ailments. It’s generally met with a look of brief but genuine surprise; which is always a nice change of pace from the usual faux-concern face and note scribbling. The thin sympathetic veil disguising their bureaucratic motivations has become lost on me. 

None of them seem to even try to understand what I’m dealing with. Over the years I’ve gotten pickier about who I see regarding their claimed “specialties”, their education, years of experience, reviews, and so on and so forth. Every referral to some other doctor and failed prescription cuts another thread of my connection to sanity. The pickiness has only dragged me further away from the fizzling light at the end of the tunnel. When I think I found someone who genuinely cares, it’s not long before I realize I was naive. They focus on the next medication to prescribe while I focus on the world around me warping and writhing as if I’m falling down the rabbit hole from Alice in Wonderland. If I didn’t know better, I’d think the doctors were conspiring against me. 

This desperation comes from my unease. Anyone would be uneasy if they hallucinated. I think it’s different for me though.  My earliest memory involves a man sitting in the corner of my childhood bedroom, his shadow elongating him in the dim light. The nightlight was supposed to keep the monsters away, and it was creating one instead. As a 4-year-old, it was traumatizing. Two decades later I’ve gotten used to them. They stay out of my way and only appear for a few seconds at a time  

However, recently, things have changed. They lurk longer, their demeanor has shifted from neutral to imposing. They seem intent on me knowing they’re there, encouraging fear. They’ve started talking to me too. The unintelligible whispers are always right next to my ear and it scares me that they seem to be learning and evolving as my mind deteriorates.  

I’ve stopped going to therapy because each session results in sleepless nights with laughter and whispers that are distant but simultaneously too close. The last couple sessions failed to provide relief or any form of comfort; they only drag me deeper into my fears. Digging up traumas became a gateway for them to latch onto my thoughts. 

My heart still stutters at the thought of what happened the last night. The whole of yesterday I felt particularly unsettled. When I first went to the bathroom after a restless few hours of sleep, there was someone in there. In reality, I just didn’t recognize my reflection. My eyes were particularly sunken, the bags underneath looking like bruises. My appetite has been minimal, and only then did I truly realize how thin I’ve gotten.  

The commute to work is a skip in memory. I don’t remember if I took the bus or decided to drive. The autopilot turned off for a few minutes when my coworker approached me while I was making coffee in the breakroom. Her name is Diane. She’s around 60 years old and aging gracefully. Her polite southern accent makes even reprimands feel full of care. 

“Honey, I’m going to be honest. You’ve looked like shit for a while now but today is somethin’ else. You look like you just crawled out of a pine box,” she said as leaned against the counter. I managed a weak smile. Despite her stern tone, there was concern softened her eyes. She reminded me of my grandma, worried for my safety. 

“Yeah.. I noticed this morning. I’m just working through some personal things.” 

She moved in a little closer, “You’re a sweet gal and have a good head on your shoulders. I’m not sure if you made the bottle or some other drug your only friend but you got to stop whatever is making you a sack of bones,” her voice droppping to a whisper.  

“It’s not drug related,” I assured her. She straightened back up with a sigh. 

“Well, you should get some support. Human support. I know you don’t like talkin’ much, however it’ll do you some good.” 

Diane continued to talk but her words became muffled. Right behind her a shadowy figure materialized. I kept my eyes on her to avoid acknowledging what only I could see, doing my best to stay engaged. The figure slowly shook its head “No” after Diane mentioned that I should get help. Never before have the hallucinations shown up when I was around others. Let alone acknowledge anything.  

“You okay, sugar?” Diane’s voice breaking through my distant thoughts. When my attention snapped back, the figure was gone.  

“Yes. Sorry,” I pinched the bridge of my nose, “I should get help.”  

My mind must have shut down after that because the next thing I knew, I was sitting on the couch staring at my reflection in the black screen of the tv. It was dark out, making it hard to determine how long I had been sitting there. Everything felt hazy and unfamiliar. I remembered my conversation with Diane and considered looking up support groups. What would I search for? Hallucinator’s Anonymous? My fingers hovered over my phone’s keyboard while I racked my brain for ideas.  

That’s when I felt weight at the other end of the couch. 	 

With a hard swallow, I looked up at the tv. My heart dropped. The figure I recognized from my closet was sitting beside me, one of its legs resting casually on the other. I knew it was them- their lanky build and hollow eyes were unmistakable. I kept my gaze on the tv reflection and a sharp-toothed grin gradually spread wide across its face where its lips would be, almost the width of its head. It disappeared when I looked to my side. In my head there was a low chuckle. 

“Good luck.”
