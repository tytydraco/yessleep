The foam earplugs I put in last night before closing my eyes did nothing for the reverberations rumbling through my wooden framed bed. “Fuuuuuck,” I groaned as I rolled over to let the piercing neon numbers of the alarm clock sting my swollen eyes. 3:52 AM. The bass beat from the apartment above was increasing in speed and tone then suddenly stopped. I made out the muffled voice as the verse climaxed through the ceiling: “Smack my bitch up!” The booming resumed.

*People still listen to Prodigy?* It was a mundane thought before my inevitable daily rage set in.

After weeks of disrupted sleep, I was beginning to lose my cool. I had tried confronting my clamorous neighbors on multiple occasions. First, in the lobby, by attempting to catch one of them on their way up only to be thwarted by a speedy elevator door. My building requires a key to get to each floor so knocking on their door was not an option. Calls to the building manager were met with recommendations to call the authorities but I knew what he really meant was, “leave me alone.” I even resorted to ramming a broom handle against the ceiling with the hopes that they’d get the hint. On that night, the electric-punk night-owls responded with synchronized stomping and laughing before cranking *Jesus Built My Hotrod* even louder. Assholes.

Another glance revealed 3:59 AM. A deep breath then I tossed the warm layer off. The alarm wasn’t due to sound for another hour. *Fuck my life.* I collected myself and found minimal solace in the idea of getting to work early enough to come home for a nap before DJ Tragedy and his sound man woke up for the “day.” I work in the city as a warehouse manager and set my own hours so leaving early wasn’t a problem, “as long as the shit’s done,” as my boss so eloquently puts it.

The air was brisk as the waxing moon settled onto the horizon. There were no signs of its warmer counterpart arriving anytime soon. I’ve boarded the 5:10 AM bus a number of times in the past for the same reason as today. It lacked the familiar exhausted and soulless faces I normally recognized during our shared trip each morning only replacing them with the unfamiliar. I always smiled at people in passing when I was growing up but was robbed of that desire only a few weeks after my move. Long ago, I confidently concluded that this city devours its inhabitants’ joy with absent affect. The 5:10 AM bus was no different in that regard. 

The driver was a salt-and-pepper haired black man in his 50’s kept warm by a poofy navy blue jacket zipped half way. The closed portion failed to disguise his round gut beneath. Rapid Transit was embossed on the left breast in yellow and orange. He offered no greeting only focusing on the machine between us to ensure I had the funds to ride. After swiping my card and an affirmative nod from him, I proceeded down the narrow isle stepping over the occasional outstretched leg or bag. I prefer to ride towards the back. Positioning potential nutjobs to the front was always safer than wondering what they were doing behind you.

The first six rows were sporadically filled with a few men in suits with briefcases resting on their laps or on the seat to their side. Their tight grasps and darting eyes deceived their attempted projections of calm… the regulars weren’t convinced either but showed no signs of interest. The city bus isn’t for everyone. Midway were a number of what I assumed were construction workers by their scuffed tan boots, unshaven faces, and bagged lunches. An occasional hard hat confirmed my suspicions. Various 20-somethings still drunk and/or high were working their way home from the overabundance of clubs and bars that populated my neighborhood. The bus faintly smelled of stale sweat and alcohol. I always appreciated how most drivers would keep the air circulating on high rather than adjusting the temperature and turning it down. It helped. A little.

The lights were turned off as I took the same seat I normally do on my regular bus and nestled against the cold glass. The city lights began their rhythmic dance as we pulled forward. *MY bus…* I laughed to myself. As if there was a difference. A neon-haired couple suckling pacifiers began jostling in their seats to what I assumed was an ill-attempt at dancing three rows in front. Thank god they weren’t blasting music from their phones as could typically be expected.

My initial scan of my peers while moving through the isle assured me it should be an uneventful ride. The gentle sway afforded by the vehicle’s airbag suspension began to lull me back to my creaky Ikea mattress.

The sound violently escalated from a low throaty tone to piercing shrill. “uuuuuhhhhhhaaaaaaauuuuuuuAAAAAAAAAAACK! \[snap\] TS- TSSSSS- CK-” I quickly sat up to see the woman had gained the attention of the rest of the bus; if only momentarily.

“For fuck’s sake…,” mumbled one of the construction workers loudly enough for me to hear four rows back. “Goddammit,” said another in a long-time smoker’s raspy voice. Crazies on the bus were nothing new. Few maintained eyes on the woman for more than a second before going back to their own thoughts or phone screens. I hadn’t noticed her earlier.

“ACK, KUH, KUH, AAAAAAACK \[crack\] TSSSS-” spouted the woman as she stood. Her guttural sounds somehow placed emphasis on her mechanical movements. Her limbs and head seemed to snap to each desired position. There was a hollow, wet, clicking sound coming from her throat when she didn’t use her voice.

The overhead speakers crackled and chopped as the driver fumbled the microphone. If anyone was still asleep, they were surely forced into our mobile circus now. “Ma’am, sit down and stop shouting or you’re off at the next stop,” demanded the driver.

Now, reader, here’s where I need you to pay attention. I assure you I was not drunk and I don’t do drugs. I know I told you that I didn’t get much sleep but I remember this next bit crystal clear; and I have no explanation. I honestly don’t know how I’ll ever sleep again.

Ignoring the driver’s ultimatum, “uuuuuuuUUUUUUGGGHHHH ACK- ACK- \[pop\] KRAT T T T T,” shrilled the tall, thin frame now standing in the isle facing rear. Her green summer dress hung loosely from her shoulders revealing rail thin arms and calves. It reminded me how it must look on a hanger in the closet. When the driver turned the overhead fluorescents on once again, I noticed that she wasn’t wearing any shoes either.

“MA’AM!,” exclaimed the now audibly angered conductor, “I SAID SIT DOWN!”

I leaned forward in my chair no longer relaxed against the window. With the newly added light I could clearly see her eyes between the long, lifeless strands of black hair that parted her partially obscured face. They were black. Completely black… and those obsidian orbs locked onto mine through narrow slits. I wouldn’t consider myself a coward and never fearful of your typical disruptive rider but I felt ice force through my veins at that moment. I couldn’t look away.

Her dark hair and eyes were an unsettling contrast to the pale skin below them. Her nose was thin and as her hair swayed, the ice I felt inside somehow got colder. There was only smooth skin from her philtrum to boney chin; she had no lips. *What in the fuck…some sort of new trendy body modification?* I didn’t anticipate feeling my back press against the seat. My tense legs began to cramp from the force pushing me back.

*OK, time for you to get off,* I thought to myself. The next stop was a block ahead.

The loudspeakers came alive again, “GODDAMMIT! SIT THE FUCK DOWN!” Only this time the anger coming out of them was muffled. My head felt… dull. As if I had cupped my hands over my ears. From my peripheral view I could make out the other riders beginning to adjust themselves to the commotion but I could not move my eyes from hers. I realized I could no longer make out the hum of the buss’s engine located beyond the firewall two rows behind. The passengers’ mouths moved and the sounds of gathered belongings should have made their way to my ears but they did not. There were no sounds other than the choking, clacking menace *somehow* coming out of her.

The awkward snaps and jerks from before became more deliberate as she moved toward me, mocking my earlier thoughts of safety in the rear. But she *was* moving toward me. *She’s got to be 80lbs soaking wet.* I thought to myself. *Get a grip.*

I gathered all the muster I could manage determined to snap out of whatever this was. *Did I fall asleep?*

“CK- CK- \[snap\] T- T- TELL \[pop\] TEEEELLL THEEEEEEM,” I heard her words but she gave no clue of their origin. Her jaw never moved but I could see her throat working.

“\[Crack\] EH- AH- EEEEYE I KNEEEEW \[pop\] CK- CK- YOOOOUUUU TOOOOO.”

*Tell them? Tell who? You know me?* My mouth failed me. In panic, I aimed to stand and confront… no, I planned to run at this point. No need to be a hero here. Psycho no-mouth bitch. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. I discovered limp arms to my sides and any effort to move my eager legs was met with unwilling stubbornness. I was frozen and could not move.

As she moved closer, I became aware of the rest of the bus moving farther from me. It’s like it was somehow stretching; placing an ever-widening gap between the world and my place at the back of the bus. The other passengers were out of focus and impossibly far away now. Her ratcheting steps drew her closer; only 2 rows separated us. The noises became louder. Odd and strange gave way to trepidation and dread.   

“EH- AH- EEEEYE I \[crack\] CK- CK- I WOOONDER TS- TSSS- WOOONDER \[snap\] IF YOOOOOU CK- YOU…”

*Wonder if I what? Jesus Christ lady! What the fuck is this??? FUCK!*

Closer.

I could make out her bare foot below the chair in front of me. One row was all that was separating us now. A frail hand of 8 digits slid onto the preceding headrest above as two thumbs dug in from the side. Black and gray nails pierced the fabric. A wave of rot and perfume forced into my nostrils.

“\[Pop\] IIIIIIFFFFFFFF YOOOOUUUUUU CK- TS- TSSSS- \[snap\] WILLLLLLL BEE TS- CK- BEEEE DIFFFFFFERENT CK- CK- CK-…”

 *Wonder if I’ll be different?* Her left foot stepped onto the seat to my right nearly on top of my useless upturned hand as her pointed knee pressed into the green fabric. The stench was forced into my mouth and stomach. *Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.* She pressed another sharp joint into the cushion to my left straddling my lap. Her skin was grayer than I noticed before. Terror took hold as I counted all 20 digits slowly reaching to cup my face. Hard nails pressed into my scalp. I’m not sure I could have moved now if I wanted. And I wanted. Her face drew closer to mine as I felt my head lift from the cushion; driven forward by those 20 piercing points.

Our eyes now only inches apart revealed my assailant’s to be… liquid? I can only describe them as flowing blackness that seemed to roll and slosh inside deep sockets. The pain from her nails in the back of my skull was intense enough to blur my vision. *DO NOT passout. You can’t passout.* I felt her clammy forehead press against mine then her nose. She did not stop.

The agonizing force of her face pressing against my own was unrelenting. It eclipsed the new growing pressure on my chest. She was pressing her entire body *into* mine. Her smooth “mouth” pressed my lips, our noses now deformed into each other’s cheek bones. The last I remember was feeling as if our eyes had actually touched. That she had moved *into* me. Liquid darkness was all I saw. It felt… lonely and cold. A vast nothingness.

A short symphony of squeals and the hissing release of hydraulic brakes did not obscure the driver’s announcement, “Cambridge and Townsend.” I sat up to find myself in the same seat I remembered. Two of the men in suits were already walking to the front and half the construction workers had been replaced with new hair styles from my perspective.

My hands raced to my head expecting to find torn flesh and hair and blood but discovered no wounds. I stared at my trembling open palms in disbelief.

“Cambridge and Townsend,” squawked the overhead voice once more.

Still shaken, I nearly ran for the door fearing entrapment if I stayed another second. I glanced at the driver anticipating some sort of acknowledgement of the nightmare we all just experienced. He frowned, “C’mon man, I’m already 5 minutes behind. On or off? Lets go!” As I stepped onto the sidewalk, the blast of cold morning air and sounds of the bustling city reassured me it was over.

I don’t remember much of the rest of my walk to the warehouse other than it was uneventful. Passers-by all equally oblivious to each other as they scurried about their morning business. *How can everyone be so… calm? What the hell just happened?*

I flashed my badge to the guard at the gate who nodded back. Then, a familiar voice from behind. “Early again, huh? You know, I know a guy who can *fix* your neighbor problem.” Greg was my boss. Kind of rough around the edges but personable enough. His colorful language helped pass the monotonous days of counting boxes.

I turned toward him as he flashed his badge then quickened his step so that we could walk together. “Huh? Oh… yeah…,” I mumbled. “Assholes were at it again.”

I must have spoken softly. “You good dude?” I could hear rare concern in his voice.

Studying the cracked painted lines on the ground as we walked across the parking area, I responded, “Yeah, it’s just… I uh… fuck man, I don’t know what to say. I think I dosed off on the bus and had some night terror or some shit. I dunno, it’s kind of fucking with me.”

He craned his neck jokingly analyzing my pants, “well, you didn’t piss yourself soooo…” His big palm nearly knocked the wind out of me as he slapped my chest. “Unless you need to go clean shit out of your drawers, we got 3 trucks in the back and Jose called in sick-…“ He abruptly stopped.

“Jesus dude!” He exclaimed.

“What?”

“What the fuck is wrong with your eyes?”

The 20 points of pain began to throb along my scalp.  *I wonder if Greg will be different*, the voice in my head cackled. I felt my lips being pulled together.
