When I first moved here, my home, I wasn't alone like I am now. When I first moved here, I couldn't quite hear the whispers clear enough, they were faint, distant. But in the darkness the voices would grow loud like a sirens wail or a bloody war outside your line of sight.

At first, I was horrified when I found her. In the basement she led a long gruesome sleep, and I stood atop the stairs that looked back into my kitchen. I approached her body, the voices consuming me. 

A monster was there that day for me too, in the corner where my light would not go, a gnawing cold spot in my house. Something terrible happened here, but I could not find it in myself to react as I should only adding to my diminishing mental state.

In my bed, I would sleep, and in the morning it would be as if nothing ever happened... though my house was becoming visibly twisted and dark. I lay on my side, with sweet nothings in thought, and the sounds of hell in my ears, I close my eyes.

I dream of what can only be described as heaven, with family and friends that I could not recognize anymore. Holiness is what I seen, with god overruling the castle in the sky, clouds as his chariots and stars for Jewry; nothing would escape his vision, and his judgment, was final.

As I awoke, the shadows scattered like a band of hunters wishing to remain unseen. It had become cold here, my home was changing, and I could not find it in myself to feel?! Why would I have been okay with this new reality of nightmare? Where was my wife? What am I, to be so unbothered? I asked the voices, and they answered.

A creature of raw terror appeared before be standing tall as if a man. Skin as dark as coal and eyes like a glowing blacksmiths forge. It stood tall and imposing over me with stained blood splattered across its inhuman hands and face composing of large teeth. It looked as if it were wearing my wife's bracelet, sapphire blue gems glimmered. As it spoke all light and sound was extinguished, the room in which I stood faded into black and it seemed all that was left in this world was myself and this creature of hell.

To me he said

“You who have sinned have been judged by the god king and here you shall be with me. Until the beating heart of this hell dies at the end of time you will repent, suffering will be your currency and death can not save you here. Look out the window and see your future of pain and sorrow, primal and brutal you will live and all at the same time you will know of your failures and sins. Those who you love will know suffering too, you will be the instrument of Satan, like me, you will grow strong, and you will loose any part of yourself you love until nothing but sin remains and then, you will be truly dead to god.”

After it finished speaking clarity washed over me, as if brought back to life I remembered my sin, and the reason I was bound for hell. I can remember her screams as if aware for the first time… the darkness I created. I made my home into a living hell, and now hell has come for me. 

I wonder what lies beyond this window.
