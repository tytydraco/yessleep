There’s an urban legend in my small rural town. You know, the typical boogieman story that parents feed their kids in order to scare them from ever wandering those derelict spaces. Ours was the sewer man.



Maybe there was some grain of truth buried in the layers upon layers, moulded by a decade of Chinese whispers. That being said, the story I vaguely recall being lectured on by my mother only seemed to go in one ear and out the other.



A while back, there’d been a man and women living in one of the outer suburbs. Each street would namedrop another, only perpetuating our rampant gossip as there seemed to be a physical location.



So, the story goes, this couple were into the occult, witchcraft or whatever mysterious rituals would scare their recipients the most. One day, one of their experiments went wrong after some local youths snuck into their home, resulting in a large fire that burned the property and killed the woman.



Being badly burned, and even deformed in some stories, the man retreated into the long-abandoned sewer system under our town, with his goal to bring back his lost wife. With that goal in mind, he needed either a sacrifice, essence or a vessel, which conveniently demanded a child.



As a result, each story forbade the kids of our town from travelling outside its perimeter, with specific focus being on a series of exposed sewer lines to the towns north. Obviously, the older teens didn’t take much notice to this wild story, often opting to scare my generation with additions to the tall tale.



Looking back, I never connected those handful of disappearances to that story, maybe due to them being swept under the rug pretty quickly. However, to my underdeveloped young mind, something more tantalising drew me to follow my brother out past our town’s boundary.

He was the rebellious type, often receiving a fair but all together ineffective lecture about the dangers of our surrounding wood. Turning fifteen and feeling way too big for his boots, he’d often rustle up a group of friends and wander over to a long-utilised hangout spot, just north of our town.



That spot was a tightly guarded secret, passed down from leader to leader and though it only really consisted of an old rundown shed and wall of miscellaneous garbage, it was prime real estate.



Me and my classmate Ethan had been dying to visit since our brothers had ventured up two years ago. Practically the spitting image of us both, our brothers were as inseparable as we were.



Likewise, our brothers ruled that hangout spot together, which definitely brought out their tyrannical side. Being gifted their lorded position by the since departing teens of last summer, they were envied by all.



Obviously, we begged to be let in, but as brothers do, they rejected us more times than I can remember. Sighting their ‘manliness ritual’ was too hard for a couple of kids, we were barred from their shared secret. Stupidly, that only emboldened us to try less credible ways to access that coveted place.



Ethan was the brains behind our poorly crafted plan. Knowing that our brothers would be out there delegating to their pack after school, we needed to catch up to them, before they entered the woods. The Birtchwick wood wasn’t anything to scoff at either, especially for two nine-year-olds, so the possibility of getting lost was a realistic factor.



Why I trusted Ethan after he got us lost there in a previous failed excursion, I don’t know, but he seemed hyper focused when he gave me the run down.



Ethan's idea was for us to write a note for our final period teacher, dictating that we needed to leave for a dental appointment. With us both having braces, we thought the excuse was a stroke of genius, though looking back at an old schoolbook of mine, there was no way that note would have passed for my mother’s writing.



Being out early, we’d ride my bike to the entrance of the woods and wait for them to guide us out to their hideout. At the time I had my reservations, with my bike chain being as reliable as the Uk weather. That being said, the slightest opportunity to get a glimpse of that coveted spot wiped away any doubts on the day.



By the time last period started, neither of us could contain our excitement, though as the best laid plans go, we didn’t start off well.



Firstly, the teacher didn’t buy our notes and second, as if fate would have it, my bike chain snapped as I unlocked it from the rack. Recipe for disaster.



Panicked, sweating and out of breath, we made it to our designated cover location, darting for the cracked bus shelter. Somehow, with all our mishaps we’d hit a stroke of luck. They were just entering when we stumbled round the corner, quickly diving behind that frail excuse for cover.



Maybe they’d stopped off at the shop or had just been walking slower that day, but the gleeful grins we shared still resonates with me now.



We were dumb kids. All we wanted was to feel cool and hang out with the older boys at their mysterious shed in the woods. Those warning drilled into our subconscious brain seemed so far away as we knelt there.



It wasn’t like we’d be going near the sewer line.

Walking far enough behind someone to the point you’re not picked up on their constantly scanning radar is hard, let alone for two overly excited kids. The walk wasn’t long, and to be fair the terrain was pretty even. The hard part was avoiding making any noise, something its evident now we weren’t very good at.



They must have seen us coming a mile away, forcing themselves to keep from bursting out at our sly shuffles through the underbrush. Ethan caught his jumper on a wildly overgrown patch of thistles, yanking it at first before I attempted to quieten him down.



This turned into a series of small snags which should have really been enough to force us back, though our desire pushed us forward. Cresting the top of the riverbank with wet feet, nettle hives and de-strapped backpacks, cradled like a child, we’d reached the promised land.



Though the site was nothing more than a series of junk piles, surrounding a crumbling shack, to our eyes it couldn’t have been anything other than a secret base, uncovered by two genius trackers.



I could see why this place was deemed a hazard by most of the parents in our town. Those pillarlike jumbles of rusted iron and splintering pallets formed a crude wall around its inherited throne room, lined with sprayed sigils and effigies to its current holders.



Watching us marvel at their rundown hideout, Kai shouted up for us to ‘get over here’. Rushing down, half tripping, we stood to attention hopefully awaiting our acceptance.



“Well, well, well, what do we have here? Mum’s not going to be happy if she finds out about your little adventure”.



His condescending tone, quickly dropped when Ethan talked his way into a bit of blackmail.



“Yeah, but mum said she’d take your PlayStation if she caught you out here again”.



His little wink, cluing me into how he intended on granting us access.



A frustrated eye roll and requisite sideways glance at Sam, quickly fell as a devilish smirk stretched across both boys’ faces.



‘Sigh’, “Looks like we’ll have to let you stay then, doesn’t it”.



Sam quickly chimed in almost as if they’d rehearse this song and dance before. 



“Oh, but doesn’t that mean they’ll have to become members. Ahh, guess they need to man up, don’t they?”.



Both boys laughs garnered the fear response they craved as we both stuttered to find an alternative. It was quickly clear they weren’t going to budge, so reluctantly we gave into their demand.



Walking us over a small banking behind the shack, we were presented with a large concrete cylindrical structure, broken in its centre. The one open end yawned like an earthbound maw, descending into a black abyss which the streams of light bursting through the canopy couldn’t permeate.



With its opposite end caved in, it became clear what they wanted from us. In a soft, almost goading tone, our brothers instructed us to enter.



“Ten minutes. Once you return, you’ll be a man, and you can hang out here as much as you like. Just ten minutes”.



Ethan’s legs didn’t seem to tremble as mine did, he was prepared to take the leap and with it, the reward we’d be granted on our successful completion. I, however, couldn’t move.



“Come on Dan, we’ve all had to do it. Don’t you want to join?”



His serpentine tongue relentless as it attempted to spur me on.



Even with my mind racing, I wasn’t able to picture anything that would have pushed me in behind him, not even the promise of that hideout budged me an inch.



Though, like the devil on my shoulder, Sam’s voice once again pierced my brain, with what could have been the only thing to reanimate my body.



“You don’t really want your best friend to go in there alone. You do know who lives in the sewers Daniel, don’t you?”.



His taunting voice echoed back my mother’s words as I fought between following my closest friend and leaving him to an altogether unknown fate.



At the time I couldn’t be sure if even they knew what was down there, but I knew they didn’t want to see me get hurt. Even in hindsight, with the crushing blame on their shoulders, I know they didn’t do it knowingly.



Mustering up whatever semblance of courage I could, I squatted down, nodding as I took in the final unimpeded image of his face, following Ethan into the dark.



As we entered a thick warm cloud slammed into us both. That burning smell of room temperature sewage mixed with the vague, but smoky smell of charred meat, placed us on the edge of bringing up our lunch.



Ethan gagged, shuffling backwards as his heels smashed into my unaware face. Reflexive jerk upwards into the concrete above, we were already prepared to leave and throw away our chance at being one of the cool kids.



Wincing from the collision and burning thick miasma, I attempted to shuffle backwards for the entrance, though in my horror, my feet collided with a hard object. School girl-esque giggles emanated from beyond the blockage as our brothers reiterated how long we had left.



With Ethan’s senses scattered, his retreat persisted, squeezing me against whatever the boys had plugged the gap with. Reluctantly removing my hand from my mouth, I exclaimed that we needed to push deeper in order to avoid inhaling anymore of those stomach-churning fumes.



With words alone not getting through, a hefty shove moved the conveyer as we crawled deeper, all the while Kai’s melodious tone rang out, excavating a pit deep enough to engulf the two of us.



“Say hi to the sewer man for me!”

 

\-

 

Ethan took the plunge first, though my senses were as dulled as his were by the time I realised what had happened. Falling the short distance onto the damp tunnel floor, we lie there for a moment, just attempting to siphon any semblance of clean air from the tainted fumes.



The sounds of sloshing liquids and a series of dense rotting clouds, fluctuated through the channel in waves, catching us off guard initially. With them, a fain whisper blew bye. In my current state I hardly even recognised it, but I can say for certain now, it was the voice of a child.



Though we were enclosed and for all intents and purposes there shouldn’t be any light, I do remember being just able to make out Ethan’s silhouette. It was clear he hadn’t acclimated as I had, as a wild swing almost caught me in the face again, more likely than not his attempt to feel his surroundings.



“Dan … Dan you there?”



His voice a stark contrast of the determined look he’d given before entering. Now reduced to the trembling tones of a scared kid, alone in the dark.



“Yeah, yeah, I’m here”.



My scraped right arm grasping his as I led him towards the wall of the larger system, we now resided in.



“Ten minutes … remember. That’s all we got to wait for. I’m sure they’ll shout us when it’s done.”



The belief hanging on by a thread as we both knew our siblings all too well.



Crouching there in the dark, the only sounds reverberating across the damp walls were the deep pants we exchanged and the faint drip of our sodden clothes.



“We just going to stand here for ten then?”



His question fell on deaf ears as my vision picked up a faint, but equally warm orange light as it trickled across a connecting passage.



“Dan?”



He shouted as a warm gust of breath connected with my stupefied face.



“Yeah, errrm … I guess so. You seeing that?”



My inquisitive question, stumping my compatriot as he swivelled in place, still using the wall as a crutch.



“What? … No, I’m seeing nothing, like nothing at all”.



Grasping his shoulders, from his apparent staring match with the wall, we both focused in on the faint embers of light.



My fear of what the sewers contained must have slipped my mind as I took a step closer. With an outstretched hand on my shoulder, he followed from the tunnel’s perimeter as our curiosity beckoned for the relief that light source would bring.



Another thick cloud paused us monetarily as I scanned our surroundings, still not sure if I was creating that soft whistling voice.



Rounding the corner, we were both met with a small industrial style red hand torch, as it lay atop a series of boxes. Clutter, clothes and what looked to be a selection of old food tines pilled up to the largest boxes right.



Blinding us both with its incandescent beam, we rubbed our searing eyes in unison, though as I reached out to grip our safety net, Ethan spoke.



“Did you … just then. A, a guy, he was right next to you, did you … not see?”



The words choked up in his throat as he stared down the long stretch ahead, before scanning back the way we’d come.



With my head on a swivel and my heart beating a vigorous tune, I shone the beam deeper into the passage, only illuminating the series of stone walled passages as they snaked out of sight.



“It was just your eyes, I didn’t see anyone. Let’s get back, it’s got to have been ten minutes by now”.



I tried to hind the growing pit in my stomach, more for Ethan's sake as to not connect any of the dots he was seemingly oblivious to. That being said, it was equally to push down the parting words Sam had burrowed into my mind.



Turning back, that once pitch-black sewer system, now illuminated, bore the image of a dripping oesophagus. Those cold stone walls oozed a thick, viscous concoction of rust colour water, which dripped down into puddles on the floor.



What I’d expected to see was nothing more than a straight cobbled tunnel leading back to that small vent, though instead, the passageway seemed to stretch on indefinitely.



Right there, standing in that maze of inky black tunnels, the heavy feeling of my soaked clothes and that foul stench disappeared. In their place a feeling far more uncomfortable and leagues stronger welled up as it filled my entire being.



As that single beam, once a lifeline, scattered across the moist cobbles, a third pair of bear footprints enlightened my already crumbling psyche. Though I think I’d always been aware, that sight guaranteed we weren’t alone.



Before I could attempt to contain it, my heart rate skyrocketed as it deafened my already weakened senses. Hardly even perceiving Ethan's hunched over posture as he regurgitated the stir fry he’d been so heroically holding down, another foul cloud blew through the passage. On its tailwind another voice stirred as it swept bye, equally as faint, though oddly from my right side.



Tearing me from my panic induced trance, a soft ear tingling breath trickled in from a passage to my right, I had been oblivious to. With only my head turning as the rest of my body stood motionless, petrified from the rhythmic beating, my wide eyes met another’s.



With my brain not fully able to piece together the picture before me, I squinted, gazing deeply into the two white pinpricks of reflected light. As I focused a foul warm gust brushed my face, almost sending me to the floor with Ethan.



Just as the moment seemed to clarify, an outstretched arm reached up from the lumpy puddle below and gripped my wrist. Twisting in place, the cone of light aimed at the cobbles below only just exposed Ethan’s tired form as he clambered up to his shaky feet.



Sighing with a momentary lapse, my mind flicked back to the out of focus image I’d been so desperate to reshuffle, now burned into my retinas indefinitely.

 

\-

 

Tethering his hand to my own I bolted forward, dragging the hapless boy with me as my cone stayed fixed to the area ahead. No matter how much those deep, primal recesses of my mind wanted to give form to it, my focus was on our escape.



Ethen’s pace quickly caught up, though I can’t say what triggered his mirroring flight response. Each dam step we took was hastily followed by the soft squelch of our pursuer.



Though my mind tried to block out those sounds, when they descended into a quadrupedal gallop, I could almost feel its hot laboured breath tickle the hair on my neck.



Rounding another corner, we attempted to put any amount of space we could between ourselves, though the scattered boxes and debris merely gave us an extra second or two.



I can’t say weather it was luck or an offering from God, but squeezing out of another passageway, the torch caught a small ascending hole in one of the walls. In the three of four seconds I took to recognise it, I had no time to make a clear decision.



Still holding Ethen’s wrist with enough force to cut off circulation, I dove up, screaming for him to follow. Dropping the torch to increase my crawl speed, I resisted the urge to turn back, fearful of what I’d see.



Unlike myself, Ethen did. Though I can’t say for certain, the short plea he sputtered out as I scraped my way up that cramped tunnel, crush me as I relive that moment.



“Please don’t let it kill me”.

 

\-

 

Carving into the surrounding concrete we both forced our way up, slowly exposing ourselves to the slivers of light piercing that blockage. Each knee sanding shuffle coincided with Ethen’s head, beating further into my upper leg. Heart wrenchingly, I was stalling him.



I tried to push through the pain, even a second or two faster, for his sake. Crashing into that heavy stopper, it barely budged as I screamed out for my brother’s assistance.  Ethen wasn’t willing to wait as he forced me up and against the wooden blockade.



Though my body was prepared to give in, I slammed all the residual strength I still held into that thick slab of wood. A bruised arm and shoulder were pittance to pay for my freedom from that labyrinth, as my full weight crumbled down into the underbrush below.



Gasping and sputtering to absorb the fresh forest air, my first thought was Ethan, though as Sam’s laughs filled the still wood, there was no movement from the tunnel.



Rushing over and gazing down into that abyss, the afternoon light barely illuminated a meter back into that tenebrous tunnel.  



Its cavernous maw had swallowed up another soul, with the only remnants a soft splash as that thing dragging his hapless body back into its depths.



“Bro, what took you so long? You’d passed the test like five minutes ago”.



Kai’s mocking tone faded as his startled eyes met my tear-filled ones, in a sudden soul crushing realisation.



“Where’s Ethen? Dan …?”



“… The man”.



Rushing to the entrance Kai screamed down, though no matter how much he pleaded, he wouldn’t get an answer.



Though I could see he wanted to descend that pipe to retrieve his brother as much as I did, the fear of those stories coming true petrified him as it had me. The only other option at the time were our parents.



We all expected to get berated and quite rightly too, though in that moment we wanted Ethan back. Another half-hearted police search of that system yielded nothing, and surprisingly this hadn’t been the first time.



Multiple disappearances over a number of years all on the north side of our town. Just like those, our experience was swept away, with practically no action being taken once again.



Maybe they’d influenced that story or vice versa, regardless nobody ever saw or found a trace of those missing children or the supposed dweller in its depths.



I still have nightmares about what he might have seen and his final words to me. The guild of not moving faster or letting him go first still weigh on me as I know it does for our brothers.  



Kai and Sam are back in town this week. I honestly didn’t expect them to ask me over for a chat, mostly as we’d not spoken properly since.



Their planning on going down to find some answers for themselves. Being their age, when the audial happened, I think I’m prepared to put my nightmares to bed and hopefully stop these same mistakes from ever happening again.
