"Duct tape, yeah?" I checked.

"Yes, for the third time," replied Sam, without looking up.

"Fourth time," corrected Jon, incorrectly.

"Look, it's important to check. If anything is missing this will all be for nothing. No mistakes." This had to work.

"It'll be fine. Worst case, one of us makes a run back for something. We've got rope, a knife, blindfold, chalk, everything. And it's perfect weather, too."

He was right. It was a thickly clouded night, with 0% chance of rain. A new moon, too. As dark as possible.

I wish we'd brought an extra knife. We had two ropes, but only one knife. I'd never even used a knife for anything but cooking. What if I broke it or something?

"Here we are, just coming up now." Jon pulled up to the lakeside, where, thankfully, there were no other cars.

"Right, lights off. Phones, too." I ordered. Sam rolled his eyes but complied. Jon was already scanning the area.

We waited five minutes, but didn't spot any phone screens or even the glow from a single cigarette. No teenagers. It was a weeknight, after all.

No-one else here. Just us.

The darkness pressed down. The black sky was too close, a low ceiling. Stifling, claustrophobic. I felt self-conscious.

"We're alone, yeah?" whispered Sam. Jon grunted. "Yeah," I breathed.

Don't stand out. Stay quiet.

We got out of the vehicle and gathered our gear without speaking further. It was hard to make out the trees on the other side of the water. This was technically a good thing.

"You guys wait here. I'm going to find a tree. I'll come back once I've got one. Then we can do the rope."

"Wait! Five minutes. I'll keep a timer."

"We don't need the time limit now, idiot."

"It can be like practice. Plus, don't want you getting lost in *this*." he said, gesturing. "We'd never find you."

"God, fine. Just wait here. Don't wander off."

He nodded. "Come on, Sam, let's get the camera done."

Walking was too slow, but jogging felt inappropriate. Around the edge of the lake, turning back to check where the others were. The only thing visible was a pair of pinprick lights from their phone screens. Vague, dark grey haze represented the sandy ground. A darker haze was the sky. The trees were black. And the lake itself was a gaping black hole, sucking in all the light. What should have been a reflective surface was impenetrable.

The water still soaked into my sneaker, though. I suppose it was water, after all.

Once there was enough of a curve, I stopped my dumb jogging and crept over to the treeline.

I read somewhere that tribal people and stuff who never use phones or computers have much better night vision. They can read a book on a night like this, apparently.

I wonder if they'd be unable to do what we were trying, then.

The first thick tree I came to seemed good. I tried to push it, but it was sturdy. Easily wider than me. Time for the chalk.

"Took you long enough," mumbled Sam when I got back. "Did you mark one?"

"Yeah, turn your phone off and look."

Neither of them could see the X, eyes blinded by their phones. That was okay. I was the only one who needed to be able to see it.

It took us a while to get the rope strung up. Turns out rope gets a lot heavier once you drop some of it in a lake, and then it's really hard to have it pulled taut. But we managed.

Jon asked, "So, we have to go away, right? I'm not walking into the forest like this. We'll drive a few minutes away."

I nodded. "That's fine. Now we actually need a timer. Fifteen minutes. Make sure you come back."

"You sure you'll be okay? You're not going to do anything... stupid, are you?" asked Sam.

"It'll be fine. Just come back in fifteen minutes, no earlier or later, and I'll tell you how it went. *And* you can watch it yourselves."

"Good luck. Be careful. It's dark, so just... don't go anywhere. If we come back and you're not here, your mum will kill me."

Once I couldn't hear the tyres, I laid down on the cool sand. Hands under my chin. Pulled the blindfold half-down. I could see the X, gleaming white, in reflection only. The solid barrier of the lake had a single weak point, and I could see right through it.

Focus. Don't blink. Look at the X.

As I stared, my eyes started making auras around the X, a kind of fuzzy smoke, pale grey in a world of pitch black.

Keep staring. Don't look away.

The black had little colours in it, indistinct blobs. I read that they're from the pressure of your eyeball inside the socket or something. The camera, obviously, wouldn't catch any of this. It was just a visual artefact. Not real.

The X was hard to make out now, having been almost completely consumed by the white haze that my eyes produced around it. Around it was the inky lake.

Keep looking anyway. Don't change direction. Keep looking right through the lake.

I read that when people stare at their reflection for, like ten minutes, they see all kinds of weird stuff. Human brains aren't good at keeping an image the same for a long time, or something like that.

The X was easier to see now. The haze was still there, but not quite directly over it. It was a bit to the side. I had to be more careful not to move my eyes away from the X, even a little bit.

The X was generating a new haze again, a new aura. Scintillating scotoma. Blurry space, like jelly, from staring too long with high contrast.

Keep staring.

The lake wasn't solid blackness. It was a hole. A giant pupil, staring up into the empty sky. And I was piercing it with my gaze, eyes trained on the X.

The new haze stayed around the X and grew, but the one on the side kept moving further away. It was agony not to look at it.

The rope was there, tied from the tree straight to me. And the haze moved towards the rope.

This is it. It might actually be happening.

Don't look away. Don't break eye contact with the X.

In my periphery, the haze kept moving, slowly gliding across my sclera, and began to shrink. Fuck.

Wait, no. It was just getting thinner. Without looking directly at it, the shape was unclear, but it was not unlike that of a person.

Look at the X. Keep the aura around it. Don't blink too much.

The haze was clearly on the rope now, moving slowly. I could see it in the corner of my eye, in reflection only. There was now something in the upside-down world of the lake.

I should have checked the camera. Was it pointing straight, or a bit down like I said? What if it didn't catch any of this?

It was moving closer still. Clearly a person now. Overall pale, with dark face and hands.

Just a bit more! Don't look away!

Being careful not to jolt my field of view, I slowly pressed the knife onto the tape. The tape connecting the rope to me. It had to be cut, not dropped, but tape is easier to cut than rope, after all.

Get ready.

She was so close now. The entire bottom third of my field of vision was her, walking, feet-over-head across the rope like a bridge. Above her, the X, and above that, blindness.

Almost! Just a bit closer.

She had just about reached the water's edge. God, she was so close. My hand was shaking, knife unsteady...

A hand firmly gripped my shoulder from behind. I yelped, dropped the knife, and *looked away*.

"Shit!" I hissed, and turned back. All the visual phenomena were gone. The last minute of staring wasted.

"Jon, what the fuck was that? It doesn't work if anyone else sees it!"

Jon was not there. Nor Sam. No-one but me. I stood up, removed the dumb blindfold, and looked around. Was the cold hand a part of it? Why hadn't anyone ever mentioned it? Did I do something wrong? Was it like the auras and stuff, just something that happens when you tense up for ages?

Fuck.

Sighing, I bent down to cut the tape. The rope went slack and floated away a little in the water. Best wait for Jon and Sam to get back.

The camera, though. I could at least see what had happened.

Feeling exposed outside, I slipped into the car to watch the playback. God, I hope it got *something*.

I watched the footage of myself, lying there like a fool for much longer than I remembered. It hadn't felt that long, but then again, it was hard to keep track of time.

The little speaker played the sounds of a car approaching. Did they come back early? I was too focussed to hear the car, I guess. Then Jon's voice, and an odd gurgle. They *were* here. Whose hand had it been? Those bastards just about ruined it.

Finally, both Jon and Sam came on screen. They weren't walking. Gripping their throats, pulling themselves through the sand, grasping at the oblivious me. Even with night view, it was too dark to see their expressions.

On the tiny screen, I saw myself stand up, sigh, and reach down towards them both with the knife.
