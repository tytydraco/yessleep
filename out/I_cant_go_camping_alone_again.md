I haven't told anyone why I stopped camping, mainly because I don't think they would believe me, but I have to tell someone, and this would probably be the best place to share my experience.

Growing up, I was never an outside kid. Staying inside, playing video games, and watching YouTube was my escape. In my late twenties, I began to gain an interest in spending more time in nature or just being outside in general. I've always been fond of camping with friends since I was young, but as an adult, spending time in the woods alone with nothing but my thoughts is one of the things I've grown to love the most. Don't get me wrong, having no one around for miles in the middle of nowhere is definitely eerie, but I find it comforting. I can't find the words to explain; it gives me time away from my home life and time to focus on me and my well-being, clearing my mind. I don't know, I might be talking out my ass...

Anyway, I'm not typing this to describe my love for camping. Usually, I stay on or near family-owned land, so I have some sort of familiarity with the area, but, due to a falling out with someone I won't name, I have resorted to driving for hours into the back roads of West Virginia for places to camp out for the weekend. I know it's technically trespassing, but, come on, it's an hour's drive off of any main roads and there are no houses within miles. Ok, it's a stupid thing to do, but I was desperate to get away. Plus, after a couple years of doing this, I've yet to see another person out there. I never leave a mess behind and bring just about everything I would ever need with me, so I don't take from the land more than I have to. I did this for a while, until about a year and a half ago.

This trip started like any other; I pulled off the highway at a random point and just kept driving. Roughly an hour and a half in, about 7:34 AM, I pull off onto a dirt road, passing a rotting shed and an abandoned van with no wheels. I chuckled at the eerie sight, and about 2 hours later, I pulled into a clearing to conceal my Jeep from the road. Not that anyone would be likely to drive by anyway. After packing my things into my oversized bag, I start hiking deeper into the woods.

''I must be in the valley'' I thought as I trekked through the dense fog that settled after I had left my car. Making a mental map as I progress forward as well as stacking small stones to mark a way back to my vehicle.

In nature you'll hear all kinds of noises from branches falling to animals just being animals. The majority would probably be paranoid and make assumptions about any sound they heard. Although the West Virginia hillbillies I call a family believe in cryptids and the paranormal, I 100% do not. To me, the noises I hear out there might as well be an invitation to stay and enjoy the natural peace.

The branches echoed through the valley as I stepped, as if there were a second set of footsteps behind mine. I almost seemed delayed, stopping only seconds after I stopped moving. Although calm and enjoying the hike, I can't help but peek over my shoulders, only to see nothing. Natural paranoia, I guess.

Call me crazy, but I enjoyed the slight uneasiness. The feeling of being watched. Knowing that there's nothing there but that lingering thought in the back of my head that something is just out of sight, beyond the fog,.

Another 15 minutes in, I notice a large tree with the bark scraped off, as if something dug at the tree trying to get inside or through it. As I got closer, I noticed there was a pattern to the marks. Not something from the Blair Witch Project or anything like that. It was lined with scratches every 3 feet, continuing up 15 feet above the first. The cuts were deep. I'm not sure how the tree wasn't dead if it wasn't already. I brushed it off as being caused by other falling trees or animals. I mean, when I say this tree was massive, I could have stood in the middle of it and stuck out my arms. Who knows how long it has been here?

Around 12:53 PM, I found myself in a clearing between the trees. This was as good a spot as any. I set my tent under a tree, made a makeshift firepit, and pulled a fallen log near for a seat. A few hours later, it was as comfortable as I could make it. It was where I would be staying for the next 3 days. Still bright out, I light up a fire. At this point, the temperature was starting to drop.

A thud came from the right, scaring the shit out of me. Something hit the top of my tent. A rotting stench filled my campsite within seconds. I search for the source; the smell grows as I get closer. Around the side of the tent was a half-eaten, half-dead snake. It had no head and was almost as thick as my wrist. Shaken for a moment, I start to rationalize what happened.

I mumbled to myself, "Damn birds." This wasn't the first time a bird has dropped its prey near me. When I was about 8–9 years old, a hawk damn near dropped a rabbit on my head. Another time, a dead mouse was on my windshield only a few years prior. Regardless, it caused my heart to skip a beat.

The stench of the rotting animal had become too much to bear. Grabbing the small collapsible shovel, I scoop up the corpse and bury it a fair distance away. The fog started to clear at this point, but the forest didn't grow any brighter since the sun had started to set. As I made my way back over to the barely illuminated campsite, I could have sworn I heard footsteps or something moving in the brush nearby. Stopping in my tracks, I try to listen closer. Right as I do, the noises stop. It was getting late, so I decided to call it a night.

I crawled into the tent and settled inside. Looking up at the roof of the tent lit up from the small fire, I could see the wet streak across it. I immediately assumed it was from the snake from earlier. After a mildly cold night of tossing and turning, I drifted into sleep. Waking up to what I can only describe as tapping? Clicking? Knocking? I'm not really sure. It was too quiet and distant. As much as I wanted to just go back to sleep, I unzipped the tent and peered outside. The fire was pretty much out, and a chilling breeze hit my face. I squinted and tried to listen again. The noise either stopped or was too faint to hear over the rustling and swaying of the larger trees. I crawled back into my sleeping bag and inevitably passed out.

The morning after I rose to a relatively quiet and clear morning, I made breakfast, cleaned up the tent, stretched, and prepared to set off for a hike. I had pretty much forgotten about the night before, chalking it off to another animal or branches falling from some dead trees. A good 45 minutes into my walk, I came across a creek. On one side was a steep cliff edge, probably 30-35 feet tall, and on the other was the relatively flat patch of wood I had been hiking through. I walked along the edge of the creek for a while until something caught my eye.

A football field down the creek had a dark figure that appeared to be on all fours. It looked like a bear but was too far to make out. I carried bear spray with me at all times while out there. Even then, I was still somewhat worried, seeing that I was the only one out here. I shouted loudly to try and scare it off. Something was off; the usual black bear would run off after a sec, but it didn't budge. After a minute or two and shouting once more, it seemed to turn slowly and take off from my direction extremely fast. Not wanting to stick around any longer than I had to, I made my way back to my campsite.

Halfway up the creek, I heard a splash behind me. I spun around, expecting to see the "bear." Again, I saw nothing. 10 minutes later, another splash, this time a little closer. I stopped, turned, and did nothing. I waited to see if there was anything. At this point in the creek, the cliff face was so incredibly steep, practically going straight up. A rock slid down the side of the cliff and landed only 15 feet away. I strained my eyes, trying to see if anything knocked a rock off the edge. Again nothing. I began to worry and speed up my walk to a jog. If it was a bear, I didn't want to be near it. An uneventful hour later, I made it back to the fire, which was completely out at this point.

I lit another fire and piled on small logs. As it grew, I warmed up, as it was substantially colder than the day prior. The wind began to pick up again, causing a symphony of howling winds and rustling trees to inhabit the forest. I cooked up some supper and started thinking about my relationships and home life. Unpleasant thoughts are filling my head. To take my mind off the things I came here to get away from, I pulled out my phone, which had nearly no service, and started listening to some horror podcasts that I downloaded off YouTube. I know horror stories in the middle of the woods, which is a great combination for me. The commentary on the stories and occasional humor cheered me up enough to take my mind off things.

As the sun began to set, the wind carried a familiar stench through the campsite, causing me to gag. Eyes watering, I search for its source. I found it. The same lifeless snake body. The same spot where it fell originally. Something had dug it up and drug it back here. I didn't know what to think, but it was too much. Just as I did the first time, I scooped it up and went burying it for the second time. This time, further than the last, I dug the hole deeper and tossed the snake in. As I filled the hole, my heart dropped.

A loud "ha" came from in front of me. Not a laugh or any word, but an exhale short and fast. Similar to a bulls snort. My eyes jolted forward to see what could lie in front of me. Nothing. I don't know if I wanted there to be something or not. I left the bear spray at the tent. Quickly, I ran to the fire, expecting something to follow, and tore the cap of the spray and waited. The howling wind slowly faded, and I stood at the edge of the fire's glow.

"Are you fucking kidding me?" A raccoon jumped out of the bushes, nearly giving me a heart attack, and ran away into the dark. I laughed at the whole situation, a bit embarrassed that the small rodent scared me, an adult man. The horror stories and the figure by the creek had me way too paranoid. I quickly calmed down and resumed eating by the fire, then settled back into the tent for the second night. Trying desperately to fall asleep.

I opened my eyes and found myself in my car. I was driving on the same dirt road I took to get here, passing the same shed and van. Before I pulled off the trailer, however, a tree fell suddenly onto the road. Not able to slam on the breaks fast enough, I hit the log, totaling my car. I crawl out in excruciating pain, holding my stomach with both arms. My shirt was stained with blood, and my ribs were certainly broken. I started hiking into the pitch-black trees, quivering as the chilling breeze shocked me awake.

I practically jump to my knees in my tent. I grabbed my stomach as an intense pain sent shocks through my body. I noticed my tent was partially unzipped, allowing the cold wind to fill the small space. Turning on the small lantern, I examine my abdomen to determine the cause of the pain. There were no cuts, only a large bruise that was starting to form. With no explanation for the open tent or the bruise, I zip up the tent and decide to pack up and leave first thing in the morning.

A long, restless night later, I got up with the sun on the third day and began cleaning up. Still sore, I took my time and noticed some of my things had been moved. As if something were looking through it frantically. I sighed and picked everything up, as most of my stuff had been spread out away from the campsite. Picking up the last bit of random packages of food and fire starters, I looked up from the ground and was met with a pair of eyes, peaking from behind a tree.

At the same time, the woods went quiet—an unnatural quiet. No rustling leaves. no animals, not even my own heartbeat. I couldn't breathe; I couldn't even move as it stared through me. They were wide and bloodshot, and the pupils were so small they were almost unnoticeable. One of the things that shook me the most was the size. They were a good 8 feet up the tree and the size of softballs. There was no head or body I could make out. It was as if they were suspended like snails.

I was broken out of the trance only by the loud, fast stomping behind me. Brought back to consciousness, I bolted in the direction of my car. Not stopping to breathe. I tripped over a root and landed on another, sending a sharp pain through my body. Adrenaline had already set in, and before I could get back up, a cold burst of air hit my neck, followed by the same loud exhale from the day before. I threw myself forward for the longest 10 minutes of my life.

I have never been more relieved in my life since my old beat-up Jeep came into view. I hop in, and as I fumble with the key, a soul-shaking tap comes from the passenger window. In fear of seeing something I didn't want to, I didn't bother looking and sped out onto the dirt road, nearly hitting every tree on the way. I stopped at a truck stop on the highway, about 45 minutes away. Exhausted, I sat there, breathing heavily, trying to comprehend what happened.

I made it home without issue. I'm sitting straight up in bed, trying to explain anything. Dwelling on it would only cause my mind to wander to unlikely conclusions. I haven't been camping since then and have tried to forget the entire thing until now. My childhood friend invited me to go camping with him on a property his family owns that's in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure what prompted me to agree to go, but I think it will be good for me. As I type this out, we're on our way to his property, and we just turned down a dirt road and passed a rotting shed and an abandoned van.
