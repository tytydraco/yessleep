**October 13, 2008**

It was a very dark, rainy night.

I remember that night very clearly. I remember it raining heavily as I sat at the bus stop waiting for the rain to clear out.

I remember checking my wristwatch, and seeing it was 10:47 PM on October, near Halloween. And of course, it creeps me out and spooks me out.



 Halloween was never my thing. I felt a numbing feeling behind me but brushed it off. The last bus of the night stopped in front of me. It was those regular yellow buses with huge windows where you could see the raindrops sliding down the glass panels.

 I thought twice and boarded the bus. I paid for my ride, hoping I could save it. Though, It would take hours for me to go home because of the heavy rain. I boarded the bus and walked down the aisle. I could still remember the blank faces of each possible passenger I could fathom, especially the driver. 



His eyes... He was staring at me intently, I think it was about to pop out. Each time I took a step further towards a seat— The people's staring gave me continuous goosebumps that I could still feel to this day.

 Finally, I sat next to an old man— very tall, I could assume he could reach my cabinet's top shelf and place my favorite toy there when I was little. I think he was around 6 feet.



 I wasn't able to get a glimpse of his face because of his ancient top hat dangling above his noticeable bald head. Yet, when I sat next to him, I vividly remember a stench looming towards me. It's like the stench I smelled when I went hiking and found a dead deer's body lying around the corners. Dead, retching animal corpses' decaying skin being eaten by crows, probably-kind-of-smell.



 I tried to cover my nose, but it didn't do any help. And so I tried to get off the seat and find another, but those eyes... They were all staring at me. Their seemingly astonished eyes crept up around my neck—circling to my nape and going down my spine. A shiver, I felt. Haunting it felt. I finally got away from that god-awful smell that old man was reeking of and got into a cozy little seat on the right side of the bus. I guess sitting beside an old man at the very back was a bad Idea.

 Curses. Why did it have to rain in a Saturday evening? The creepy staring, the disgusting smell, now this fogged-up window? My night couldn't be all better. Though, I felt a little weird the first time I put my foot down on this bus. All I could feel was the continuous goosebumps starting to creep all around my back and I felt very itchy. Wait, that temperature... I could hear someone breathing behind me.

 I could feel their breath... I could smell their stench...! Must it be the old man from earlier? What the hell is he doing smelling me like I'm some prey?! I couldn't just let him do this to me! But this might cause me a commotion and get kicked out of this bus.



 So I brushed it off and looked out the window. Minutes had passed by, and I heard some clicking in my left ear. I wanted to turn around so bad but something's telling me **NO.** And a while later I heard more clicking. I feel like it's just the old man clicking his tongue to pass the time so I tried to sleep. It felt like minutes had turned to hours, and seconds had turned to years. I wasn’t able to fully delve into a deeper sleep, woken up from an ambulance siren. Annoyed and bewildered, I checked my watch. And what I saw confused me. REALLY confused me.

  


The watch still says 10:47, as if time has stopped. It can’t be broken! I mean, it’s working perfectly earlier. And it’s still working now! I tried to sleep it away, but I just couldn’t. How could I not? No, it’s not because I can’t sleep. It’s because I CAN **NOT** SLEEP!



I remember. That old man. I can still feel the hot breath hitting my neck. 



I remember its hot rotting breath.

I remember it creeping behind me.



I was scared. I was scared, and no one was helping.



I was scared of what he might do to me.



I was scared to open my eyes.



I was scared.

  


I am scared. To this **day**, I am still... Traumatized.

  


I felt the need to stop it, so I opened my eyes. I opened it, and I saw everything. THOSE EYES. MY GOD, THOSE EYES! 



I FELT THE BUS STOP. I FELT THEIR STARES PIERCE ME LIKE THE STAKE THAT PIERCED JESUS. THEIR FACES WERE BLANK!



NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.



I TURNED MY GAZE TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE WORLD—TOWARDS THE WINDOW—AND SAW RED. THE **RAIN** TURNED RED! 

  


I jumped out of my seat and looked around, seeing everyone but **him**. 



The old man was gone.



How?



Why only him?



What about the others?

  


The darkness crept around me. I felt it engulfing me. SWALLOWING ME. EATING ME ALIVE. The bus’ rooftop flew into pieces and rain started to fill up my pants with yellow and.. AND—



I opened my eyes.

  


I saw it.



The tall, lanky man.



It's ruined top hat— sharp claws, freshly ironed business suit… I could hear his footsteps ringing in my ear. His face... I couldn't see it.



But all I heard was the clicking. The next thing I knew, the people sitting weren't there. It was just me and It.



It stopped. It chuckled, and there it was. It revealed to me his face.

  
  


It

was smiling.
