I hope whoever reads this can take my story and avoid making the mistakes I did. Please don’t fall for the trap I did.


The attic was suffocating, thick with dust and the weight of forgotten memories. The smell of mildew clung to the air, making it hard to breathe, but I pushed through, determined to find something—anything—that could distract me from the dull ache of my existence. That’s when I found it, buried beneath a pile of old blankets in a chest that should have been empty. The book.

It was heavy in my hands, the leather cover cool and cracked, as if it had been left in the cold for far too long. My fingers traced the strange symbols etched into the surface, each one sending a shiver down my spine. I should have put it back. I should have walked away, but something in the pit of my stomach—something dark and hungry—urged me to open it.

The pages were brittle, almost fragile, but the text inside was anything but. The words—if they could even be called that—shifted and twisted, like they were alive, teasing me with their secrets. The illustrations were worse. Horrors sketched in such detail that I could almost hear the screams of the tortured souls they depicted. My skin prickled with a sense of dread, but I couldn’t stop myself. I was drawn in, pulled deeper into the book’s twisted promise of power. And then I saw it—a ritual, ancient and forbidden, to be performed under the light of the blood moon.

The promise was simple: power beyond imagination. The kind of power that could change everything. My heart pounded in my chest as I read the instructions over and over, each time feeling that dark hunger inside me grow stronger. The night of the blood moon was only days away, and as the date approached, I found myself unable to think of anything else.

My dreams were the worst. Every night, I found myself standing in a forest clearing under that blood-red moon, surrounded by shadows that whispered my name in a language I couldn’t understand. The whispers would crawl under my skin, cold and slithering, leaving me paralyzed with fear. Each time I woke up, I could still hear them, echoing in the back of my mind, urging me on.

The house had changed too. It was subtle at first—objects moving ever so slightly from where I left them, lights flickering even when the power was fine. But soon, the sounds started. Footsteps in the corridors, creaking floors where no one was walking. The air grew thick with a presence I couldn’t see but could feel pressing down on me, heavy and suffocating.

I should have left then. But I didn’t. I convinced myself that I was being ridiculous, that the book was just a distraction, that the strange occurrences were all in my head. I needed this. I needed something to change, and the blood moon ritual was my chance. My destiny.

The night of the blood moon arrived, the sky dark and ominous, the moon hanging low and red, like a gaping wound in the heavens. I could taste the metallic tang of fear on my tongue as I gathered the items for the ritual—the mirror, the candles, the knife, and the locket my mother had given me before she died. My hands trembled as I drove out to the secluded clearing, miles away from civilization, where the trees seemed to lean in, their twisted branches reaching for me like skeletal fingers.

The clearing was deathly silent, the usual sounds of the night absent, as if the forest itself was holding its breath. I set up the ritual, my every movement deliberate, my heart racing in my chest. The candles flickered in the still air, casting long, wavering shadows across the ground. The mirror, positioned to catch the light of the blood moon, began to glow with an unnatural, pulsating light that seemed to draw me in.

The incantation rolled off my tongue, the words foreign and sharp, scraping against the inside of my mouth as I spoke them. The wind picked up, a low howl that seemed to come from all directions at once, carrying with it the stench of decay. I could feel the ground trembling beneath my feet, and the air around me thickened, as if the world itself was reacting to the ritual.

When I reached the final step, I hesitated. The knife was cold and heavy in my hand, the sharp edge gleaming in the light of the blood moon. My breath caught in my throat as I pressed the blade to my palm, the skin giving way with a sickening ease. The pain was sharp, hot, and I watched, almost mesmerized, as my blood dripped onto the mirror’s surface.

The moment the first drop touched the glass, the light in the mirror flared, blinding me. The world around me seemed to twist and warp, the trees bending at impossible angles, the ground beneath me rolling like waves in a storm. The air was filled with a deafening hum, a low, guttural sound that rattled my bones and made my teeth ache.

And then, the mirror shattered, the shards flying outwards like daggers, cutting into my skin. I fell to the ground, my hands grasping at the cold earth as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. My body ached, my mind reeling, but amidst the chaos, I felt it—a surge of power, dark and intoxicating, coursing through my veins.

I struggled to my feet, expecting to feel triumphant, but instead, all I felt was cold. A bone-chilling cold that seeped into my very soul. And then, I saw it—a figure, tall and cloaked in shadow, emerging from the darkness. My breath caught in my throat as it drew closer, its form flickering like a dying flame. Its face was hidden beneath a hood, but I could feel its eyes on me, burning with a malevolent intensity.

“You have called me,” it whispered, its voice a rasping echo that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. “And now, you are mine.”

The words hit me like a physical blow, knocking the breath from my lungs. I stumbled back, my heart hammering in my chest. I tried to speak, to scream, but the words caught in my throat, strangled by the overwhelming terror that gripped me. The entity stepped closer, its presence suffocating, pressing down on me like a weight I couldn’t bear.

“I… I didn’t mean to…” I managed to choke out, my voice barely a whisper.

It laughed, a sound that sent shivers down my spine, cold and cruel. “You sought power, and you found it. But power always comes with a price.”

The air around me grew colder, the darkness closing in, wrapping around me like a shroud. I could feel it seeping into my mind, twisting my thoughts, warping my perceptions. The ground beneath me seemed to fall away, leaving me suspended in a void, the world around me nothing but shadows and whispers.

Images flashed before my eyes—visions of those who had come before me, those who had performed the ritual and suffered the consequences. I saw their twisted faces, their eyes hollow and empty, their bodies contorted in agony as the entity consumed them, piece by piece. I could feel their pain, their despair, their regret, as if it were my own.

“No…” I whispered, shaking my head, trying to banish the visions. “No, this can’t be happening…”

But it was. The entity loomed over me, its form growing darker, more solid, as if feeding off my fear. I could feel it wrapping around me, its tendrils creeping into my mind, my soul, taking hold of everything that I was.

The locket. My hand tightened around the locket, the only thing I had left of my mother, the last piece of my humanity. In that moment, I realized what I had to do.

With a cry of desperation, I hurled the locket into the shattered remains of the mirror. The instant it touched the glass, a blinding light erupted from the ground, burning away the darkness. The entity screamed, a sound of pure agony, as its form began to unravel, torn apart by the light.

The pain was unbearable, searing through me like fire, as if I were being ripped apart from the inside out. But I held on, clinging to the locket, to the memories of my mother, to the last vestiges of who I was.

And then, everything went black.

When I woke up, the clearing was bathed in the soft light of dawn, the blood moon gone, replaced by the pale blue of the morning sky. The air was cool, fresh, a stark contrast to the suffocating darkness of the night before. I lay there for what felt like hours, staring up at the sky, my mind a haze of pain and confusion.

The book lay beside me, its pages blank, as if the ritual had never existed. But I knew better. I could feel the void left by the entity, a hollow place in my soul where it had once been. The locket was gone, along with the power I had sought. In its place was only the memory of what I had done, of what I had almost become.

I left the clearing that morning, the estate behind me, determined never to return. But I could still hear them—the whispers of the shadows, the cries of those who had come before me, echoing in my mind, a constant reminder of the darkness I had unleashed.

Years later, I heard rumors of the book resurfacing, found by another poor soul drawn in by its promises. I tried to warn them, but the darkness had taken root in my mind, warping my words, twisting them into lies. No one believed me.

And now, every night, I lie awake, haunted by the memories of that night, by the shadows that still linger at the edges of my vision, waiting. Every blood moon, I feel the pull—the dark, seductive call of the ritual—reminding me that once you’ve tasted the darkness, it never truly lets you go.

It waits, and one day, it will come for me again.
