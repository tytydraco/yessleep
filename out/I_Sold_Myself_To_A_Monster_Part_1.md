I was fired from my fulltime job. I’m not exaggerating but this may be the end of the road for me.   

I’ve worked as an engineer for a certain car factory, designing the machines that make parts of the frames. I knew one of the machines that would make the render rail was going to Mexico, but I assumed I would transfer my knowledge to somewhere else in the factory.  

Nope. They gave me two weeks' notice instead.  

I had planned on staying at that place until I retired. Sure, I made a decent wage over the years. I should have had enough tucked away to not worry. However, my younger sister got sick a few months ago, and all the treatments wiped out our savings.   

My father passed away two years ago. My mother is retired and still trying to recover from that. My sister worked two part-time jobs to support her husband who is still in university to become a lawyer. She was the one paying for everything. Cancer runs in our family so my mother pestered her into at least doing self-checkups. My sister found a lump and thank God, she found it when she did. I took all the overtime I could and worked my ass off to pay for as much as I could for her. And now my only source of income has dried up.  

At this point, I will work any job that will take me. The issue is I look way older than I actually am. My sister always said my only good quality was the fact I looked like a handsome refined middle-aged man when I turned twenty. I haven’t changed since then aside from more grey hairs and bags under my eyes from stress.  

My work experience is specialized in the automotive industry. Now all the companies are tightening their belts because no one can afford to buy cars. All the other jobs that don’t require a heavy resume have been scooped up by students or anyone who appeared younger than myself. Who would want to hire a washed-up older guy when they had a hundred younger ones lined up for an interview?  

Desperation and self-pity were the reason why I sat waiting for the subway near midnight. I spent the entire day pounding the pavement looking for job leads. When nothing panned out, I went to the bar drinking only enough to get buzzed. I couldn’t afford to get drunk. I sat alone silently wondering what I could sell to make fast cash or what organs I could live without.  

A thought I had been trying to avoid came to me as I stared ahead listening to the soft buzz of summer insects. I had a good life insurance policy. Hell, if I died in the factory the payout would be good. I still had one last day there to finish up. Could I pull that off though? The insurance doesn’t pay if you kill yourself, right? How hard would it be to make it look like an accident?   

“Money troubles?” A voice came from the bench next to mine.  

I could have sworn I was alone. I should have heard anyone else arriving. Glancing over I saw a man dressed in a well-fitting three-piece suit. The vest was a dark silky red as well as the lining of his jacket. He had a leg up so he could rest his head against his knee as he met my gaze. It was odd that a guy whose shoes were worth more than my rent asked me about money. His jet-black hair shone in the bright subway lights. Something about his eyes made the hair on the back of my neck rise. He must have noticed. A smile crept over his face and I swear it reached his ears hidden under his long wavy hair. A stupid idea came to me, one I couldn’t shake.   

“Are you the devil or something? Here to ask if I’ll sell my soul?” I half-joked praying it wasn’t true.  

“Nope. Only asking you to sell your body.” He said and gave a playful point and a wink in my direction.  

I silently got up from the bench and took two steps away when he called for me to come back. 

“If I can’t find a job I’ll give you a call. I’ve only been looking for a few days. Do you have a card?” I asked him after I turned back around.  

He rested his chin in his hand not letting his grin drop.  

“Can your sister wait until you decide to call me? Are you going to go all Breaking Bad on us?”  

The blood in my veins froze. How did this guy know about my sister? I could no longer pass him off as a weirdo in the subway. He knew why I needed money and how much. I couldn’t figure out why. I was a nobody. I wasn’t worth anything. 

“Why me? Can’t you get someone else?” I asked still in shock over what was going on.  

“You look like a tired forty-five-year-old man with a mean streak and bad eyes. You're totally one of my top bidder’s type. She has a weird older guy fetish and it’s hard to find ones that suit her tastes.”  

I frowned at his explanation. Really? There was someone out there attracted to a guy like me?  

“I’m not forty-five.” I corrected.  

“You don’t need to be. You just need to look like it and be over thirty. The last guy turned out to be twenty-eight after she made an entire creepy shrine to him. When my client found out her new hot crush was younger than her it took a few months to recover. I would like to avoid that mess.” He said with a sigh that made him lose some of the intimidating air. It seems like he’s been through a lot.  

“I don’t know if I want to deal with her.” I said with my arms crossed.  

“I’ll do up a contract and send half the earnings to your family when you’re sold. It is an auction but when she sees something she wants she puts down a huge bid to get it. No one else will want you so it’s a guarantee that you’ll be bought by her.” He explained and I hated how I was honestly considering this deal.  

“So, I’ll be some rich chick's sex slave or something?” I asked trying to hold back how uncomfortable those words made me.  

“No. She doesn’t sleep with the men she buys. You just need to get dressed up in suits or something. I heard rumors she makes private movies but none of the guys strip in them. I wish it was sex slaves. I can understand sex slaves. She’s just... weird.”  

“I still want to pass on all of this. Surely some things go behind closed doors you don’t-” I started with my hands raised.  

“She normally starts the betting at ten million.” The man cut into my speech.  

“How fast can you make a contract?”  

He was taken aback at how quickly I agreed to sell myself after I heard the amount. Five million should cover my sister’s medical costs. Heck, it should cover all her bills until her husband gets out of school and finally becomes a damn lawyer.   

“I have a car waiting. I’ll explain things on the way.” He stood up and I followed after him my heart beating as I wondered if this was really that good of an idea.  

If this was for my sister, I didn’t care what kind of stupid outfits I needed to wear or what odd fetish this person had. I’m her older brother and it’s my job to take care of her. Because of our large age difference, I wasn’t exactly around for her when she needed it growing up. I was going to make up for that now.  

I didn’t see much of the action house I was brought to. I was taken into a dark small room crowded with wooden crates. The man wrote out a clear contract we discussed on the way there. There were no underhanded tricks. Nothing was added and all I needed to do was to sign my life away. Then, I needed to wait for an hour until the auction started. I found it a bit odd how close we were to cutting it time-wise. Did he have his eyes on a few people and I was the only one who agreed? Or did he put off grabbing me off the street until the last minute?  

They left me with a bottle of water and an old magazine as I waited. An employee finally came to guide me through the back halls and to the stage. He was dressed up as well but wore a sheet of silk over his face. I wondered how he could see and navigate through all the boxes and items lining the hallway. They didn’t handcuff my wrist or anything like that in case I had second thoughts. Judging by the glimpses of the antiques and paintings waiting to be sold I knew this group had a lot of money at their disposal. Running away would be useless.  

On the way, the auctioneer told me that the five million wasn’t even that much for their company. But the woman had been in such a depressed mood for a while it was bringing everyone else down every time she showed up looking for a replacement man for her broken heart. In short, he found her a bit annoying.  

I heard the sounds of him speaking to the crowd trying to hype up the merchandise as I stood behind a large thick red curtain. My heart started to beat as sweat appeared at my temples. Doubt filled my mind. Would I even be sold? I looked terrible. Stress and lack of sleep bore down on my features. Anyone normal would pay money to stay away from me.  

I heard the signal to come out behind the curtain and onto the man stage. The worker gave me a small nod and I would like to think he smiled under his face covering. The lights were blinding for a few moments. The auctioneer started to explain the reason why I put myself up for sale. I didn’t know if a sick sister was enough to get rich people to feel enough pity to up the bid.   

Finally, my eyes adjusted as I stood on the center of the stage looking out into the crowd. Something was... wrong. At first, I couldn’t make out the kind of shapes of the people sitting in the front rows. They wore gowns made of glittering gems and well-woven suits. But their heads weren’t right. Were they wearing masks? I spotted some snake-headed people and some that had other animal-like features mixed in with their human ones. I either drank way more than I thought or this was a rich people thing. It had to be. After all, how legal was this auction? Of course, they had to be hiding their identities with odd costumes. The auctioneer’s voice snapped my attention back towards him.  

“Who will start the bid for us?” He called out to the crowd with a soft yet powerful voice.  

I squinted to see a pair of red curled ran horns he did not have before. And how did he made his legs appear so skinny and... goat-like?  

“Forty million! He’s perfect!” A shrill voice came from the crowd.  

The bidder had gotten out of her seat and into the alleyway waving her paddle with a number on it. A few bouts of laughter rippled through the crowd.  The guy said that the one who was going to bid on me was a girl, but how could anyone tell the gender of that person when they had on such a weird outfit?  

Long black wavy hair flowed over their entire body covering the entire face. Any exposed skin was jet black and she wore a large bagged sweater over top of some ripped jeans. For someone bidding that much money, you would think she could afford better shoes than dirty flip-flops. She was half my height and with the covered face it was hard to tell an age.  

I gave the auctioneer sideways glances praying this wasn’t the person I would get stuck with. He ignored me.  

“If there are no more bids-” He said ready to move on to the next thing.  

“A hundred million.”  

I nearly lost my balance at those words. I didn’t see who spoke. Murmurs rippled through the room as people tried to figure out if there was a reason why I may be worth that much and if they should take a risk and bid. When the second bidder came forward the room fell silent.  

It was hard to see with the lights in my eyes. The person was large. Just massive. The lights dimmed and a chill ran through the air. I squinted to see better. A dark haze surrounded the figure that stopped in front of the stage making it impossible to make him out clearly.  

“Any other bids?” The auctioneer struggled a little with his words.  

The person who arrived was a big deal. Even I could figure that much out.   

“Nope! The only thing I love more than a hot old guy is a hot old guy with a monster!” The small figure said and crossed her arms.  

“Sold.”  

My head shot between the stage and into the crowd so fast I almost broke my neck.  

Monster?   

All the movement must have made things finally click. I was the only human inside this building. I don’t know why it took me so long to realize that. My feet were frozen to the spot as the beast I had just been sold to easily stepped onto the stage, I could do nothing but stand in fear as that huge dark shape came closer, a clawed hand reaching out to take hold.  

“Duke, please pay first!” The auctioneer scolded the beast.  

The hand landed on my shoulder. It was covered in black fur and was as dense as a bear’s paw. His other hand was outstretched to pour out countless gems and gold onto the stage as payment. He must have dropped way more than a hundred million worth of just uncut gemstones alone.   

My mouth was dry. I wanted to scream, to run, to do anything. I forced myself to look up to meet the eye of the monster that just bought my future. When I saw was a pair of eyes so unnatural they might as well belong to the devil. I couldn’t describe their color or the twisting shapes of the pupils. Seeing them for a moment caused a primal fear to run through every cell of my body. If I looked at them for long enough, I was certain I would no longer become myself. My brain would be so changed by their influence that I wouldn’t even be human.  

I fainted which saved my life.  

For a long while I stayed in the darkness of sleep trying to avoid the horrors that waited when I opened my eyes again.  

I didn’t want to wake up again. My head hurt like hell but not from drinking the night before. Was it the night before? How much time passed? I sat up to see where I ended up finding myself in a bed large enough to fit six people.  

The room was gloomy. No other way to describe it. A large fireplace was on one wall with glowing embers was the main source of light. A large window took up most of the north wall but the sky was so cloudy it was impossible to tell if it was dawn or dusk. The entire room was covered in dust aside from the bed and a chair in front of the fire. All the almost gothic-style furniture had been left to rot. I was about to get out of the heavy blankets when a set of footsteps came from just outside the room.  

My heart nearly stopped as I had flashes of the fear I felt looking at that creature for a mere moment. What did he want with me? What even was that creature? If I was going to die, I prayed it would be quick. A large finger tapped my shoulder causing me to jump out of my skin.  

The beast stood next to the bed somehow getting into the room without opening the door. In the dim light, I saw him clearer than on the stage. He had a long-pointed snout that reminded me of an Afghan Hound. His eyes were covered with wavy locks of fur with two pointed stiff ears coming from the inky mass. At first, I thought the mane wrapped around his neck. He reached up with dark claws to slip off a long deep red cloak that covered his body dropping it to the floor. His body looked human enough aside from the black fur and his long animal legs ending in powerful claws. They appeared to be more like a lion than a wolf or dog. He wore some light pants that were tied at the sides, nothing else.  

“You...” I said and could barely speak with such a creature within arms reach. “Why did you buy me?”  

I mentally begged it was because he wanted to rip me apart and eat me.  

“To sleep with.” He spoke in an almost bored voice.  

I gave him one more look over as my stomach sank. This wasn’t going to end up as a sappy monster romance like the other bidder had hoped. If he tried anything I would die. Simple as that. There was simply no way anything could happen between us without me experiencing the most humiliating death ever.  

I let out a squeak of protest. I simply was too scared to do anything. This beast was too large to fight back. A million thoughts ran through my mind as I was forced next to him as he got into the bed. His one arm tucked around me as if I was a pet cat.  

I thought I could die from embarrassment. I wish my sister knew how much I loved her to go through with all of this. When she got better and if she ever had any kids I deserved to have one named after me.  

I expected the monster to do more but we stayed still in awkward silence. His eyes were covered but I knew he wasn’t asleep. What was his next move going to be? After a few minutes that felt like they stretched to the end of the world, he spoke again.  

“You’re too small. This won’t work.”  

He raised his arm and I scrambled to freedom. I stood at the side of his bed, legs trembling wondering if this was real or if it was all just a cruel game.  

“You are free to go. You do not serve the purpose I purchased you for.” He sat up in bed and turned a covered face in my direction.  

“I shouldn’t be complaining because of how much money you spent, but how could you not tell this would not work out before you made a bid?” I said trying to slow down my heart.  

“I have owned pets before. They warmed up the bed regardless of size however I could never move them in order to sleep.”  

I stood in shock instead of fear. The person who had mind-breaking eyes was also the type who couldn’t bring himself to move a sleeping cat.  

“You appear unsettled.” He commented but his tone never changed making the question sound insincere.   

“I just... thought you bought me for a different reason.” I sighed.  

“And that would be?” For a moment a slight inflection came to his words as if he was almost interested.  

I made a hand gesture that got my point across because I could not bring myself to say it out loud. His face didn’t change so it was hard to tell if he understood what I was trying to say.  

“It appears there has been a misunderstanding.” He stated the obvious. “I have learned your language from many different sources and time periods. I was unaware of the double meaning of those words.”  

I let my hands drop knowing I should be thankful I wasn’t in danger or dying one of the most painful deaths imaginable, but I now didn’t know what I was going to do.  

“You still appear unsettled. If you were hoping for that sort of physical interaction, I must tell you due to our differences it would be impossible.”  

“Not according to the books my sister reads...” I muttered mostly to myself.  

I saw his head move slightly. I put my hands up to try and say that was a joke.  

“I am thankful to you for spending as much as you did. It’ll ensure my family will never have to worry about money again. The issue is, depending on how much time has passed since the auction they probably think I’m dead. So, I can’t just go back to them. I’m in a bit of a hard spot.” I admitted.  

“You have caught my interest for the moment. Please elaborate.”  

He just forked over more money than most would ever see in a lifetime. The least I could do was explain what kind of a mess I got myself in.  

“I signed a contract at the auction house. Half of the funds would go to my family. But it would be suspicions of all of that appeared at once. My mother buys lottery tickets. They’re going to arrange a fake win that will pass whatever checks it needs to. Still, fifty million is a lot. So, they agreed to slowly feed it to them with fake investments over time.” I started.  

“Understandable. But why leave you out of the picture?” He commented.  

“The bidder I was supposed to be bought by provides everything their little harem needs. They also want their little toys to stay around for at least a year or so. If I asked I could have probably stayed with her till I died. But it would be hard to explain to my family what I was doing. I can’t call them up going ‘ Oh hey, congrats on the big win. I don’t need any money and sorry I can’t see you for an entire year, don’t go looking for me ok bye.’” I crossed my arms feeling an odd heaviness in my chest.  

“Dying is the way to ensure they do not use the winnings looking for you. Was it easy to separate from them like this?”  

I found myself unable to look at him as I gripped the front of my shirt.   

“There’s an age difference between me and my little sister. I moved out around the time she was born. It’s not as if we’re close.” I said as if trying to convince myself.  

“Dying because you have a sister. You can die if you are not close. A slightly interesting thought.”  

I didn’t know how many humans he had met before. I bet most of them wouldn’t throw their life away for a person they saw three times a year. But what life did I even have? I was fated to be stuck in a string of dead-end jobs until I retired. I’ve never been able to stay in a relationship for more than a few months. I wasn’t getting any younger looks-wise. It was easier to just be dead and buried.  

“What is your name?” He asked, his voice back to sounding bored.  

“Arven.”   

He stayed silent for an entire minute. I didn’t want to see his eyes again but I hated how I couldn’t read his expression.  

“Is that a popular name for your species?”  

Why did that sound like a backhand comment? I kept that thought to myself.  

“It’s on the rise.” I shrugged. "What about you?”  

“I am referred to as The Duke.”  

“Duke of what?” I said and glanced around the huge half-rotten room.  

“I have forgotten.” He said and followed my gaze. “It is entirely possible I was never a Duke. The name stayed due to where I live.”  

Judging by the size of this room this place must be huge. With introductions out of the way, I started to think about what I should do. Duke said I was free to go. Should I try and go to that female bidder?   

“You may stay here for the time being. I shall provide a room and stock the kitchen. However, I understand if you would like to start a new life with other humans you require currency. I can pay in gold if you work here. This place is covered in dust. Clean it and I shall pay you a certain wage by the end of the month depending on the effort you put forth.”  

That seemed more than fair. Even though he could hand me a few million worth of gold and let me go, he wouldn’t. The job Duke gave was easy enough. I had no idea how long it would take to clean this place or to make enough money to start over.  

“I got paid every two weeks at my old job.” I joked.  

“I shall pay you a certain wage at the end of two weeks depending on your effort.” Duke said without missing a beat.  

There was definitely a cultural barrier between us. I shouldn’t complain. From the looks of things, this was the best outcome I could have hoped for.  

“Create a list of items you require. A bat-like creature delivers to this area.”  

The Duke stood up to pick up his cloak. He walked past and started working on starting a new fire. He had given up trying to sleep for that night. I was told that I could pick out any room to use. I asked if I could have some things from my apartment. As long as I added the items to the list of things he needed to buy there would be no issue retrieving some of my items. I doubted my family was already clearing out my place.   

“I feel as if I should warn you that a few creatures may arrive here seeking my power. You are human but should be fine if you keep your wits about you.”  

I didn’t like the sound of that. I hadn’t gotten a good look at all the other monsters at the auction house. I had the feeling the Duke was a big deal. I didn’t know how many creatures would be dumb enough to try to start anything with him. This guy could bring down the entire world with a quick glance if he wanted to.   

I thanked him then left the room to look for one suitable enough to claim. This mansion was massive. It made me feel like a mouse running around. I kicked up dust with every step that hurt my throat. How long had he lived alone? And what suddenly motivated him to go to the auction that night? I didn’t have a lot of answers but I knew I had a lot of work ahead of me if I ever wanted to get this place clean.  

I found a bedroom down the hallway. I took off the first layer of heavy blankets finding the ones underneath acceptable enough to use. All the clocks had stopped so I wasn’t certain what time it was. My phone ran out of juice. I didn’t have a charger on me. Did this place even have outlets? Since I wasn’t tired, I got to work cleaning my new bedroom for hours. I took a shower before turning in for the first night.  The wind blew so hard outside it rattled the windows. This place felt cold and damp. It took a long while to get warm enough under the blankets to sleep.  

I found some paper with an old ink dip pen to make a list of items I needed. I couldn’t find the master bedroom again though. I could have sworn it was just a few dozen doors down from my bedroom. This place was a maze. It took me all morning just to find the stairs to get to the main floor. Duke found me to give some directions to the kitchen because I hadn’t eaten since I got there. He explained the delivery may be delayed due to a large storm coming our way. That was fine. I didn’t need the cleaning supplies right away.   

There were a few kitchens however the one with any food was down in the cellar. It was dark so I needed to use an oil lantern so I wouldn’t break my neck on the stone stairs. At the moment, there was only some bread, persevered meat, and cheese stored down in the small cooking area. That would be good enough until anything else arrives.   

I did try and work for the first day. I focused on sweeping up the dust and then dumping it outside. I needed some proper soap to make the floors shine. I worked all day and barely even touched the first floor. The grey clouds outside grew darker as the light fixtures along the wall started to glow. I wondered what they were powered on. They flickered as if a flame was behind the frosted glass. I was able to head to my room for the night when a knock from the front door caused me to nearly jump out of my skin.  

It came again. I stood for a moment listening for The Duke to come and answer. When he didn’t, I walked over to open the heavy door a crack to peek outside.  

A bright smiling face greeted me. With some effort, I pulled the door open more. A hard cold wind blew that chilled me down to my bones. The person outside was tall and thin. She wore a jacket and jeans with a heavy bag across one shoulder. A set of large ears came from her red hair. She smiled in a way that showed off her rows of sharp teeth.  

“I’m here to drop off some packages. Is The Duke around?” She said and showed a clipboard of papers.  

This must be the bat creature he mentioned. I shook my head. I hadn’t seen him since the day before when I gave him the list.  

“I really need him to sign for this. I can’t leave until he does.” She explained sounding a bit stressed out.   

I felt bad for her. I understood what it was like to wait on others for your job.  

“Come on in. I can check his room.” I said to step aside for her.  

She happily took up on my offer. I planned on going to his bedroom on my own but she followed behind. I didn’t know if The Duke would be alright with us invading his personal space. But he did make these orders, right? I walked up the long main stairway feeling winded by the time we arrived on the second level. The delivery girl didn’t appear phased at all. I should have told her to wait at the main entrance. Too late now.  

I walked over to the door I was positive was the bedroom I woke up in. I opened it and saw a dusty bedroom I hadn’t been inside before.  

“Huh, weird. I could have sworn this was it. Hang on let’s try this one.” I walked over to another doorway and opened it with the same result.  

The Duke's room had a carved wooden doorframe. A few of the bedrooms also had carvings along the door all slightly different from each other. Each time I opened an empty room I felt my face get redder and redder. At least the girl patiently followed behind.  

Finally, we stopped at one that had to be the right room. I knocked on it calling out for The Duke. The wind blew hard outside and I heard a sound come from behind the door. Since we were the only ones who lived inside this mansion, he must be inside.   

“He might be sleeping.” I explained to her.  

I tried the brass doorknob. It stuck hard and refused to turn. I didn’t want to enter the room without permission. I knocked again and planned on only rattling the knob to make a noise. It broke off in my hand startling me. My arm slipped. My exposed arm caught the stump of the broken knob scratching hard enough to bleed.  

“Sorry, I-” I started as I looked over my shoulder at our guest.  

My blood froze when I saw her expression. It was hard and honed into the cut. Her eyes flashed red. In a split second her human face changed into one that looked like a monstrous bat. A hiss came from her throat as her hands flew upwards, claws out.   

I screamed and fell into the door to get away from her. The next few seconds were a blur. Her claws ripped the collar of my shirt drawing more blood. I did everything I could to get away nearly tripping over my own feet. The room wasn’t The Duke’s bedroom so he wasn’t around to help. Instead, it looked to be some sort of storage room for a mixture of medieval weapons. Dust-covered suits of full armor lined the walls. Some boxes of weapons were left scattered around as I darted behind them trying to stay at arm's length from my attacker. I thought that these weapons would solve my problem. I grabbed a large mace left forgotten on the floor. It refused to move. To my horror, everything I might have used to protect myself was too heavy to use.  

The beast cackled amused by my weakness.   

“What a fool you are letting me inside! I’ll drain you slowly! I have all the time in the world to locate my real target!”  

The fact I let this monster inside without a second thought stung a little. I needed to think of a way out of this. My eyes darted around looking for anything useful. As I silently panicked she clawed at her face, the human skin ripping away to reveal a much larger creature that had been hidden inside. She tore away the last of her disguise. The sight of a stocky bat-like beast now charging in my direction made me screech again and back up hard into a suit of armor.  

The heavy piece tipped to the side causing the others next to it to fall apart. The armor I bumped into had been holding a large halberd in front of it pointing upwards. When I slammed into it, the hands came loose and the long weapon came downwards. Dust from items crashing to the ground blinded the monster so she didn’t see what was coming down on her head. The blade sank down into the monster's skull, forcing her large body to the ground.  

I stood, heart racing as things slowly stopped falling apart and the dust settled. I waited for her to make a move but the monster remained face down on the ground with a blade sticking into the back of her skull.  

A hand landed on my shoulder and I jumped, my body still shocked to let out a sound.  

“Is everything alright?” Duke asked, his eyes covered but he sounded almost concerned. “I heard a female scream.”  

I brushed off his last comment.   

“I think I let a vampire inside...” I said as my heart rate slowly returned to normal.  

A very long silence came between us.  

“Did you want a vampire to-” He started but I cut him off.  

“No! She said she was delivering a package! And that you needed to sign for it!” I defended myself.  

His expression didn’t change and yet it felt like he saw me in a new light I wasn’t too keen on.  

“I’ll clean this up for you.”  

With a gentle push, he guided me toward the door. How did he even get inside? I was facing the door the entire time. And there wasn’t a second entrance to the room. The body twitched so I didn’t want to waste time asking him questions.  

By some miracle, I found my bedroom and collapsed into bed. I was dirty and needed a shower. Yet, I didn’t want to do anything for a few days. I wanted to stay under the blankets safe from the horrors of the world.  

When I woke up again an envelope had been placed on my bedside table. Inside were two small gold coins and a short letter with cursive delicate writing.  

‘Payment for your trouble. Delivery to arrive in the morning.’  

After I read the letter, the words faded disappearing from the paper. I had thought Duke was going to kick me out. After all, I endangered us by letting a monster inside.  

On second thought, I only endangered myself. I doubted a little vampire like that could do anything to him. I sat on my bed for a few minutes trying to get my head in order.  

What was The Duke? Why were creatures after him? And was it really alright to stay here? For now, I needed a shower. I should be fine waiting a little bit longer for answers to some of my questions.
