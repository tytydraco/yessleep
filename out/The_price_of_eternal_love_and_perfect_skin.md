Everything hurts. I've long since left the bright, trembling hysteria of pain behind in favor of opiate blurred acceptance. It pulses under my skin like an abscess with every reluctant contraction of my ventricles. When it's time for my pills, I ask Eric *The Question* again. I even say, "Please?"

Eric doesn't answer.  His eyes, once bright with laughter are now as blue and vacuous as a cloudless sky. He says, "Sshh," and gives me something through my IV. As I begin to slip into a restless semi-consciousness, I hope that it's enough. Hope. A redundancy that still sparks uselessly between my fried synapses. An involuntary spasm of my wasted heart. 

Eric pushes the tray table away and closes the laptop where I compile glimpses of my fickle memory during my brief moments of clarity. Try to make sense of the senseless. My hands slide away from the keyboard and tumble into my lap. My breathing slows, but not enough, as memories rise like vapors in the swirling darkness behind my eyelids. Eric's honey-blonde curls are dyed dark like mine. Junior year, then. 

*Eric is sitting in the grass holding a guitar and laughing. His hand rests on the slender thigh of a young girl swallowed in the folds of his letterman jacket. Evelyn. The unlikely envy of every bubblegum smacking, glossy-lipped blonde who ever scrawled my brother's name in fervent loops of gel pen pink.*

*Evelyn is smiling. Her overbite dents the pink swell of her bottom lip. Her freckled features are mostly obscured by an enormous pair of glasses that she pushes up the slant of her nose every couple of minutes. Eric touches her frizzy halo of mouse-brown hair and kisses her cheek. He presses his thumb and index finger into his palm, pinches the skin, pulls a rose from the drop of blood that forms there.*

*Eric was always good at magic tricks. Taught himself, he'd boast. Evelyn laughs and clutches the thornless rose to her chest. Eric shows her his unmarked palm. I'm getting closer to them. Eric looks at me and smiles, opens his mouth to say-*

"Hey, brother," I slur without opening my eyes. I am swathed in blankets, anesthetic and memory. I wonder if Evelyn can hear me, now. Can any of them hear me? I graze the surface of consciousness but am soon soothed back under, only just,  by the whisper of the ventilators, the murmur of the regeneration tanks, and, of course, the drugs. Another memory rises through the fog of medication, this one's later. Senior year. 

*Red and blue lights flicker over Eric's heaving back as he crouches, pleading with god, over a smoldering, shapeless mass crumpled and oozing on the asphault. The air smells of charred meat, burnt rubber, gasoline, ozone.*

*A man is vomiting in front of a ruined pickup. I'm getting closer. The man is Benji, Eric's best friend. Blood is running down his forehead from a wound hidden beneath a thick shock of dark hair glittering with tiny shards of broken glass from the shattered windshield of his truck.  He's sobbing desperate apologies, choking on them, as Eric rises and goes to him. At first, I think my brother will embrace his friend, ease his agony. I realize my mistake as he draws back a clenched fist.*

*I begin to run towards them. The smell of burning hair and sizzling fat makes me queasy. My gorge rises as I notice that the smoking thing on the road is twitching. An unsettling whistling sound issues from it, like the air being let slowly out of a balloon. I think I knew then that the charred hunk of meat was Evelyn, even before I saw the burnt out husk of her Pontiac in the ditch. Even though I've always been bigger, I can't pull Eric off of his friend by myself. The cops have to help me.*

My body jerks in the bed and my eyes fly open. Someone is screaming over the ventilator. I think it's Mom. I know it's a scream, although it doesn't sound like one at all. Lacks the volume, the vitality of a true scream. This sound is not unlike the one Evelyn made lying on the pavement that night. A series of beeps rise over the sound as Eric presses buttons on the pump, adjusting the drugs. The whistling stops. I don't try to turn my head to look. I can't. Not now. I squeeze my eyes shut and surrender to the dark. Out of it blooms another memory.

*Eric pacing in the hospital waiting room. His clothes and skin are decorated in blood and ash. He clenches and unclenches his swollen hands. I come up behind him, put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. He shrugs me off, whirls around, eyes wild. This night has made the world his enemy.*

*"Don't fucking-" he begins, but is cut off by the double doors swinging open. His head swings around as if it were similarly hinged. The doctor steps in, looks around at each of us and shakes his head in silent apology.*

*I remember hearing later that Evelyn's body never made it to the morgue. Disappeared right out of the body bag, according to the hospital transporter. He said he felt the weight of it leave the cart. There one minute, gone the next. Now you see it, now you don't.*

*Eric was always good at magic tricks. Taught himself, he'd be glad to tell you, once upon a time.*

When I wake next, it is to the sound of someone crying. Slowly, I realize that it's me. "Sshh," Eric says. He is standing over me holding a syringe. "It's alright, brother," he murmurs from behind his surgical mask. His gloved hand is cold on my shoulder, squeezing, but not to comfort me, not really. Then there's the pinch of the needle, the sting of the drug and I'm floating through the ether of another memory. 

*Benji standing in front of a podium in his cap and gown. He clears his throat and smiles but his eyes are empty. Benji is Valedictorian, now, since Eric's grades went into free fall. Eric just stopped going to class, after what happened with Evelyn. Benji is expected to give a speech. He opens his mouth, and shuts it again. He looks down at his burn-scarred hands. "I-" he begins. His voice is tremulous. Someone in the crowd cheers encouragment and applause ensues. Everyone knows it wasn't Benji's fault. It was an accident. Almost everyone knows that, anyway.*

*Eric is next to me. It is the first time I've seen him in weeks. Although he stopped attending classes and extracurriculars, he seems to have found other activities to keep him busy and away from home. My brother remains standing, clapping slowly long after everyone else has sat down. I try to pull him back to his seat but he shrugs me off.  He stops clapping but doesn't sit.*

*Benji seems to shrink into the silence. Finally, he raises his eyes and, I think, he only sees one person in the room. "Eric," he says into the microphone, "I just want to say I-"*

*The shrill keen of feedback cuts Benji off, some rogue signal interfereing, just before he slams his own face into the podium. Blood fountains from the ruins of his nose when he straightens his spine. "Eric..." he croaks before he slams his head into the wood again. Someone screams. Ragged, bleeding mouth slack with wonder, Benji stares at the scatter of his own teeth and blood across his notes, but only for a moment before the next impact.*

*Many are screaming now. Myself among them. I am the only one, however, screaming for Eric to stop. A few move to help but find themselves tossed backwards like dolls. Eric was always good at magic tricks.*

*By the time Benji slumps forward, his face is a pulpy jigsaw puzzle of flesh and blood marinated in the vitreous humor of the exenterated globes that were once a pair of warm, brown eyes. As a riot of bone fragments, teeth and silver globs of wobbling brain tissue tumble from the fractured skull of his one-time friend, Eric finally sits down and smiles.*

*Benji never made it to the morgue either. Abra fucking cadabra.*

Pain, a shreiking phantom, yanks me into a rare lucidity, a reality scintillating with white hot agony. My eyes open to the pale sterility that is my home, now. Then my mouth opens, screaming. A true scream. Not a whisper, not a whistle. The vacancy that my legs and pelvis once occupied is filled with invisible razors, needles, knives. Every sharp, mean, unfeeling thing. I shreik helplessly at the tangle of tubes that snake out of my limbless abdomen, collecting my waste, filtering my blood. 

For me, it was an accident at my construction job. The temp agency crane operator was strung out, that day. I wasn't quick enough to dodge the fumbled support beam that crushed my lower half.

For Mom, cancer. Tumors. Her lunatic cells continue to divide in the bed next to mine. Her flesh is kudzu, climbing over the edges of the mattress, trailing along the floor. Perhaps Eric sees potential there, for the things in the regeneration tanks. 

In one, whats left of Benji bobs like a cork in a viscous, pale green stew. It would seem that Eric was able to salvage enough of his friend's gray matter so that he screams forever. Toothless. Soundless behind the buffer of the tank he is suspended in as he regrows his skin. Although, when it's time for him to come out, to be burned again, then, we hear him. Eric needs the skin to be perfect. Nothing less than perfection for her. 

In the second tank, the tangle of sinew that once was a girl with frizzy, mouse-brown hair and an overbite, sleeps, skinless, at the bottom. She waits for Eric to teach himself the magic of medicine. Of stem cells, of stolen skin, of rebirth. 

Eric's gloved hand is cold on my forearm as he pushes the medicine into my IV. 

"Eric," I say, and then I ask him *The Question*. "Will you let us go? Please?" I suppose it is a euphemism, but I know he understands exactly what I mean. 

"Sshh," Eric says. "It's alright brother."

My breathing slows, but not enough. Before my eyelids become heavy with sedation, I watch him approach Evelyn's tank. His shoes crush the dessicated plant matter that surrounds it. He pulls a rose from the palm of his hand, and lets it fall. He kisses the glass.
