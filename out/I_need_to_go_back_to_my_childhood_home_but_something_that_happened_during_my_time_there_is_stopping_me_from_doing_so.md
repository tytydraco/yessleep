Honestly, there was nothing creepy about the house I grew up in. No dusty attic or dark basement that any reasonable child would be afraid of.

But there was something. Something that, for some reason, absolutely terrified the shit out of me. It was one of those unexplainable childhood traumas that you would look back on and laugh at how stupid you were. Yet, I can’t bring myself to laugh. It just feels… wrong.

When I was about ten, I moved out of my sister’s bedroom into a guest room that my parents had been leaving empty for a while. They didn’t explain why it was unoccupied for so long, but I assumed they were saving it specially for me after I reached a “mature” age, and never questioned anything beyond that. I mean, could you blame me though? Such questions never crossed my gullible little mind.

But I won’t lie. I loved the room. It was tucked away, out of sight, hiding in a corner of the house that my family didn’t frequent. No one could disturb me. While the interior was plain, different from the extensive designs the rest of the house had, it was the largest of all the rooms. And to six year old me, that was like the best thing ever. So of course I would accept the room without hesitation, even if something unsettled me. Something being...

The curtains. I know it sounds stupid and I know it is stupid, but the wall curtains in the room never sat right with me. They hung opposite of my bed, stained like yellowing teeth. No matter whether there was wind or not, they would ripple as if pulsating, breathing… living. And as they swayed, the edges would just barely brush against the wooden floor, like a corpse dangling from a noose, whose feet would never touch the ground again. That was what I saw. That was what I was afraid of.

As long as I was in the room, those curtains would never leave me. They haunted both my waking and sleeping hours, whisking in and out of the corner of my eyes. I even put up posters, shelves of action figures, basically filled the entire place with all the toys and books that I liked in hopes I could distract myself from the uneasiness. But it wasn’t long before that uneasiness grew into fear. And in turn, that fear plagued my sight.

Soon, I began to see feet at the bottom of the curtains. A small pair of feet.

At first it was just fleeting moments, disappearing when I did a double-take. I thought it was just a speck of something in my eye. “Floaters”, I learned after searching a bit on the family computer. Yeah that had to be it, floaters and my stupid imagination messing with my head. I remember calling myself crazy and laughing it off every time. But it didn’t stop there. Oh by god I wish it did.

It was right after my 11th birthday party. The guests had long left and we were about done with the cleaning and packing up. Even though it was close to midnight, I remember not being tired at all. I still had energy. In fact, there was probably enough energy in me to keep me going for days. It was also one of the rare few times my strict parents allowed me to stay up. So naturally, the excitement added to my determination to stay awake for as long as possible.

My mom, knowing there was nothing she could do to possibly convince me to sleep, just sent me to my room after we were done. Humming, I headed over to my special corner of the house, twisted the doorknob and pushed the door open…

There were feet. They were unmistakable. Two little lumps of flesh and fat, under the hypnotic swaying of the curtains, were pointed directly at me. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. They didn’t disappear. Illuminated by the cold white LED lights of the neighbour’s house, those feet seemed to glow, as if asking to be seen.

A scream gurgled at the back of my throat but it only came out as croaks. I tried to run but my legs couldn’t move. I pulled and tugged and yanked but like the pale feet under the curtain, mine didn’t move. As my gaze locked, for the first time, being so far away from my family became a nightmare.

I inched closer. It happened before I could comprehend my own actions. Then again, and again, I found myself approaching the curtains against my own will. Their haunting billowing, the unnatural ebb and flow of the cotton sheets, begged me to come closer. I couldn’t stop. At some point, I think I didn’t want to stop even if I could.

The curtains were right in front of me, and that disgusting yellowish colour of maggots was all I could see. The fabric crawled on my face.

Then, I was drowning. I didn’t know how I ended up stuck in the curtains, but I was. They wrapped themselves around me and every push in an attempt to free myself only seemed to drag me deeper into their prickly grasp. My heart pounded. The air melted into a humid sludge and so each breath I drew grew shallower and shallower. My head spun. And it was then when I realised, there was no exit. There was no escape. Only the rotting yellow of the curtains and the cold white light that it soaked in existed.

As my consciousness started to fade, I remember thinking one thing very clearly:

*I was going to become the pair of feet under the curtains.*

I awoke a few hours later on my parent’s bed. As soon as I saw my mom standing over me, I bawled my eyes out and babbled incoherently about what I had experienced. Unsurprisingly, she didn’t believe me. She just told me that I had fainted in my room due to exhaustion and left it as that. But I didn’t mind. Her warm smile was soothing and I was away from the curtains. That was all that mattered then.

Despite what she said, my parents asked me to move back into my sister's room the next day. The suddenness of the situation was odd but I obviously welcomed it. Then they locked up my old room with all my stuff inside. As much as I wanted them back, it meant being near those awful curtains once more. So I left them there. And just like that, the room and its curtains were never brought up again.

I eventually moved out of my childhood home into my own studio apartment in the middle of a bustling city. My parents still live in that house. Well… lived. They recently passed away in a freak accident while traveling to visit me. My sister, as the new heir of the house, decided to put it up for sale since it was far too big for her family. So now, I’m supposed to help her clean out their belongings. Unfortunately, this includes my old stuff in that room.

I keep telling myself there is nothing creepy about the house I grew up in. Yet I can’t bring myself to go back.

*What if I see those curtains flutter? What if I see my own feet again?*
