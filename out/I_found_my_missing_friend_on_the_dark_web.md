  Most people have heard of the dark web. They think that most of it is just a bunch of killers talking to each other and weird sites or cursed videos.


  Maybe, I've never encountered anything like that. Most of the Dark Web nowadays is just drugs and illegal porn. If you are wondering how I know about this I found out about the dark web from a couple of youtube videos on the topic. 


  So one day i got bored from searching the regular net and downloaded the Tor browser. 


  I waited for it to download but as it did I got a couple of things ready. I got a price of paper and tape to cover my webcam that way no one can hack it. I also got an anti virus software on my computer just to be double safe. 


  When the notification dinged that Tor was done downloading my heart started beating fast in excitement. Like when you have your phone on late at night and you are worrying if your parents are going to bust in.


  I click Tor and I am brought instantly to the dark web search engine. I played around with a few safe sites from other youtube videos. I instantly became disappointed on what i did see. Most of the sites were drug and porn related.


  There were a few money laundering sites but still nothing unusual like what I was hoping for. There were a couple of site dump sites. I clicked a few of these but mostly came up with cult sites and red rooms where you had to pay a lot of crypto. 


  Not that I was interested in a red room. From a dark web forum that I saw most of them just play gore footage 24/7. 


  While scrolling through a dump link site a webpage instantly caught my eye. The site was called:


  X.missing.Y


  Intrigued I click on the site. Preparing to look away if something illegal came up as most of them did. What I came across was a bunch of missing posters. 


  I scrolled through the endless web of pages. Most of them were missing from 20 - 40 years ago. A couple of these names I even recognized from the news outlets. I thought at first this might be a site that documents missing people and hope that someone on the dark web can help find them. 


  I click on a couple of ones but it just brought me to another page that showed the missing picture but at the bottomw it showed zero entries.


  What do they need entries for? I thought as I hover my mouse on it. Then another black thing showed up on it saying 0 MB.


  Do these things have files on each of them? Another thought crossed my mind as I exit the page. I scroll through a few more missing people reports until I just stopped on one.


  My heart started beating as sweat was rolling down my face as I looked at the person on the poster. Chance Mclain Missing: April 14, 2010. 


  I remembered that face. He was an old friend I had at elementary school. He was 10 years old. A nice kid that always done as he was told by his parents and teachers. One day we were playing at the school playground at the jungle gym and the next second he was gone. 


  All the teachers looked for him before calling the police. No one knew where he was. They did a search for 3 weeks but no clues popped up on his whereabouts. 


  But why is his picture here? I thought as I clicked on it.  There like 5 file attachments added to it. It came up too at least a gig.


  I downloaded all the files. I didn't care if they had a virus or not. I just wanted to know what was in them. What they were letting other people on here see. 


  As the files got done downloading i exited Tor. I clicked open my file manager. There was 1 audio file, 2 picture files, and 2 video files.


  I clicked on the audio file first. 


  My heart was beating as I heard a man say, "is the camera ready?" Then I heard a shrill scream of Chance going "No! No! Noooooooo!" 


   I quickly turned the audio off as my ears were still ringing from the screams. Then as I calmed myself down I clicked on the first picture. All it showed was a picture of Chance with a BEFORE imprinted on it. 


  I already knew that in the next picture it wasn't going to be Chance smiling. I clicked it anyway and immediately threw up. I ain't going to give you the details of this horrific picture. 


  After this I'm scared of looking at the video. What should I do? Should I call the police?
