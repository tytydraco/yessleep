I was 10 when my finger got stuck in one of those chinese finger traps. i knew how to get out of them but i could because i could not move my fingers for some odd reason so i had my dad cut the trap off of my fingers.

 The next day i was thinking about was happened and decide to get my finger stuck in a place where i could easily get it out. i stuck my finger in a water bottle just big enough for my finger rendering it stuck. when i tried to move my finger nothing happened. i then knew that something was wrong but never brought it up to my parents because they wouldn’t believe me. at least that’s what i thought.

 fast forward 23 years later to now. i am living in an apartment on 23rd street because i lost all my money in the gambling industry. boy do i regret that, but that’s beside the point. i think of how i can recorder financially and can only think of one thing. robbing the bank in my city. i never thought my life would come to this but here it is and there’s no turning back.

 i go to the closet in my apartment and pull out my gun case. i only had a pistol because i sold all my guns to gamble. i realized i would have to do this quickly and quietly. i thought about doing it at night but, no i can’t there is no way to get passed the alarms and security with how broke i am. decided i would have to do an old fashion stick up, or sneak quietly into the vault. i opted for the quite way not wanted to risk dying for the sake of some money.

 i start drawing out a game plan. when i get there instead of going through the side door closer to the vault. i decided it would be more unexpected to go for the door out back leading to the gun safe where the extra guns are for the guards. there i could get at least a gun better than a pistol. then from there i will sneak down the hallway to the safe room that is guarded with two guards. that leads to my next problem.

 how am i supposed to take the guards out quietly when i have no suppressor and i need to move fast considering i have no way to take down the cameras. now i’m rethinking the sneak approach. i have ti get this perfect or i’m screwed. there is no way in hell i can afford going to jail for a bank robbery.

 my next thought is to sneak in the back 
 room then get some guns go out the door and back out front and run in there guns blazing hoping for the best. yeah… that’s it. i’ve decided it better to die trying to get the money than going to jail trying to get the money. i will head there tomorrow morning considering that’s when there is not many people there so i don’t have to risk civilian casualties.

 i get in bed and fall asleep alarmingly fast considering what is happening the next day. i wake up and get my pistol and put in my pocket and head out. it’s a decent walk so it takes 30 minutes to get there and now i’m ready. then i realize i forgot a mask. no way i’m turning back now. i sneak around to the back and find the door now all i need is to pick the lock which was surprisingly easy considering where i’m trying to get to. i grab what looks to be an AR. don’t know what kind though. i sneak out back and make my way tit he front hastily because i have a gun in my arms talking myself into going through with this.

 i make it up front and after a hesitation i burst through the door. 

 “PUT YOUR HANDS UP” i scream.

 i look around and realize that there is only the bank teller in the room. not wasting another second with this opportunity i point the gun at the teller.

 “where’s the key or what’s the code… i have no idea what you use to get in the vault so just give me that” i whisper hoping nobody heard me yell.

 “the code is 271945” the teller says with a shaky voice.

 just then two guards walk through the door and i see them they see me and they draw their weapons.

 “this is the end” i thought raising my gun.

 i hold the trigger down hoping for the best as the recoil kicks me off my feet and i fall to the ground. 

 i get up and look where the guards used to be two body’s with holes through them lie there as what happens just sets it. i get up quickly and ask for the code because forgot it after the commotion.

 “271945” the teller says with a even shakier voice than before.

 i run to the back expecting door here to be guards as soon as i get hallway. there weren't any which was confusing but i’m not mad. i find the vault and the keypad.

 i type in the code on the key pad.

2 7 1 9 5

the vault opens and i go inside i see the money and with no hesitation go over to it to start loading it in my bag. that’s when i realized i forgot my bag. i shove as much money in my pockets as i can and head toward the door.

 as i get about 5 feet from the door it slams shut. now this is an airtight vault door we are talking about that slammed shut in my face. i am amazed and just stand there for a second trying to process what happened. then i try to move.

 i cant move. i cant believe my curse that i found out about years ago came back to bite me in the ass. i try to scream but can’t. i’m dead. the vault opens after 30 seconds that felt like an eternity. turns out it was an eternity. 

 when the vault opens i see one person in raggedy clothing. the outside world is just vast forest that i can’t see the end of. i have so many questions. i start rambling.

 “what happened”
 “how did you get in here”
 “what year is it”

 the guy explains everything and basically he has the same curse as me. whenever your full body gets paralyzed the time fast forwards until you but you age normally. it also turned out that the vault I’m in is made of some material that is super strong so that’s why the vault is still standing. it is year 4025. it was year 2145 when i robbed the bank. it’s been 1920 years. i don’t know what to think.

 the guy starts to reach in his pocket and pulled out the pistol i had. he’s the bank teller. i probably dropped the gun when the recoil knocked me off my feet.

 “i’ve been waiting for this moment for centuries”

 he raised the gun and before i can say anything he pulls the trigger. 
 
long story short never mess with the bank teller of the Atlantic bank on 936 3rd avenue in new york city.
