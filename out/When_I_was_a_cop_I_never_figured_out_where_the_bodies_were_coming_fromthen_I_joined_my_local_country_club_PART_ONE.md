The guy walking towards the tee box in a pink polo and 60-dollar gray shorts dubbed “The Khakinators” by the online golf retailer from which they were purchased had no idea he was about to get shot. Neither did I. Until it happened. The president of the club, a guy named Dan Harrington, stood atop a plywood platform, holding a microphone, sneaking peeks at his Omega at regular six-second intervals. The guy wearing the Khakinators wasn’t going to make it. He was 40 yards out. He was digging around inside his butt crack, probably trying to readjust his boxers. I couldn’t remember exactly what he had said in the clubhouse. One minute he was there; the next he was gone. I think it was something about how coffee always gave him the “Hershey Squirts.” The guy had obviously lost track of the time.

Dan Harrington checked his watch one final time before stepping off the platform and walking over to a couple of guys wearing green uniforms and sitting in a golf cart. Dan whispered something to them and pointed towards the man in the pink polo. The men in the golf cart smiled. Their faces were pointy, weasel-like. The driver had a long, greasy ponytail that flopped around as he drove. The passenger had a tight, blonde mullet complete with a matching handlebar mustache. 

The two started driving towards the guy in the Khakinators, closing the now 30-yard gap at an insane speed. The cart lurched across the fairway, hissed, rocked, then screamed. The driver flipped a switch. A circular spot on the back of the golf cart began to glow a harsh red as it propelled the cart forward. Fifteen miles an hour. Twenty. Thirty. The guy in the Khakinators stopped, stared. They were going to ram him. He tried to jump out of the way but was too slow. His shorts were too tight, cutting off above the knees, revealing blankets of black hair covering thick calves. 

The cart struck him at an angle. The guy glanced off, stumbled, wobbled, then fell on his side. His butt was the first thing up. He stuck it into the air as if he had a white flag clenched between his cheeks. The cart slowed, made a U-turn, and stopped. The guy with the ponytail got out. He went around the back of the cart where a matching set of blue Titleist bags stood, belted in like patients at a mental institution. The guy paused for a moment, as if he were debating which club he should use for his next shot. After a second, he shrugged, said something to the passenger, and pulled a Benelli M4 Tactical shotgun with a pistol grip out of the bag. The Italian-made firearm had a ribbed barrel and looked like something out of a zombie apocalypse movie. Ponytail pumped the action and took his first shot at the Khakinator from the hip as he stood by the cart. 

A 100th of a second later, the Khakinator’s right buttock disappeared behind a pink mist. Ponytail pumped the action again, this time making sure he got a lot closer. The Khakinator was pulling up clumps of grass, desperately hoping the roots were strong enough to support his weight so he could drag himself to safety. 

“Hey!” Ponytail shouted. “I’m gonna have to fix that!” 

He stepped on the guy’s hand. Right first, then left. The Khakinator rolled over onto his back and tried flailing his legs, hoping to land a lucky jab with his cleats. Ponytail was ready. He danced around the guy, slapping at his raised cleats. He dropped the Benelli by his side and used his right hand to pick one of the guy’s cleats off his feet. 

“Stop! Please! Stooooooooooop!” shouted the khakinator. 

Ponytail didn’t care. He raised the cleat high above his head and used it like a hammer over the guy’s face. Whack! He raised it again. Whack. Again. Whack. The guy was writhing, moving however he could, trying to stay alive. After the sixth whack, Ponytail got bored, tossed the bloody shoe aside, and used the Benelli to finish him off. The spray of blood covered Ponytail. He used his fingers to pick pieces of brain out of his neatly-manicured hair. 

I used to be a cop, so I’ve seen my fair share of sickos and freaks, but this was something completely different. My stomach was hot with anger. The whole reason I left the force in the first place was to get away from the violence. I had always been a peaceable guy until I became a cop. There was something about being exposed to violence that was turning me into a monster. One night, I raised my hand in an argument with my ex-wife. Like I was gonna hit her or something. I never did, nor would I. But I remember the way she looked at me. I brought my hand down and the two of us just stared at one another for what felt like an hour. That was when I knew I needed to leave the force. I quit the next day and started taking night classes for computer programming. All things considered, my life was better. I felt healthier and happier, but I guess there was always a piece of me that missed the danger. Sounds kind of messed up to admit, but hey, we’re probably all a little worse than we like to admit. People make up all sorts of excuses for themselves. I’m not claiming to be some moral hero.

The dead guy’s body was still twitching when the men loaded it into the back of the cart. His pink polo turned red, but his gray shorts looked better than ever. Stain-free fabric. Just like the website advertised. Ponytail took one look at the torn up grass and shook his head. He took a shovelful of sand from a compartment on the side of the cart and filled in the divots before offering the club president a thumbs up and driving away towards the clubhouse. 

The rest of us were under no illusions after that, and I realized, for the first time, what would happen to me if I didn’t win this tournament. I felt my stomach roil with hot fear as I bent over and threw up the enchiladas I had for lunch.

  
\*\*\*

The rules were simple. You hold up the group—you die. Another golf cart came farting over the hill a moment later, this one carrying two guys that looked like the Blues Brothers dressed in green uniforms.

“Hello? This thing on?” Dan’s voice echoed over the tee box. Bulky PA speakers sat on either side of the platform. Whoever was in charge of running sound had forgotten to switch off the echo effect. “Hello hello hello. This thing on on on?” Dan pointed to a chubby, mustachioed guy standing right next to me. 

“Ryan Ryan Ryan.” He dropped the mic. “Can you help a guy out?” Ryan stood there, hands on his love handles, munching on a wad of Hubba-Bubba. “This is not my problem” was written all over his face. He rolled his eyes, broke stride, and climbed up onto the platform. The plywood groaned and squealed beneath his weight. The whole platform shifted and wobbled a little. Ryan didn’t even bother walking around the sound mixer. He reached over the back, twisted a single knob, and gave Dan a thumbs up.

“Technical difficulties,” Dan quipped. No one laughed, save for the green-uniformed men in the golf cart. Dan ran his hand through his slicked-back shock of black hair. He was dressed in a tuxedo. His tie was pulpy and green with a gold clip in the shape of a sand wedge. 

“Welcome to Preacher’s Pulpit’s 97th annual Memorial Day Men’s Amateur tournament,” he said. His teeth were whiter than white and he used the type of plastered-on smile religious leaders use when they ask for donations so they can buy a private jet. He paused for applause. When nobody so much as scratched their bum, he moved on. “I’m sure you’re all familiar with the traditional tournament style. Here at Preacher’s Pulpit, we do things a little differently. Each of you has been assigned to play in a foursome based on occupation. You are playing only against those within your own foursome. The scores of players in opposing foursomes have no bearing on your acceptance into our membership. You will play the front nine, after which we will reconvene and tally scores. The bottom two scorers will face elimination.” 

He paused after this statement. His lips began to curl towards the ends. The rest of the crowd was standing, staring, stony-eyed. Ryan climbed down from the stage and shoved another piece of gum into his mouth. When he saw that I broke rank, he cocked his head towards the platform.

“You got a death wish, idiot?”

I shook my head and turned back, thinking of what they did to the khakinator, and imagining how they would probably enjoy beating my brains in with a nine iron if I gave them a reason. Even though I emptied my stomach, my gut wasn’t feeling up to par. Excuse the bad pun. Staring down the barrel of death is something you never get used to. Even if you put on a brave face, it’s scary every time. I only hoped I’d be able to relax in time for the game. If I took my first stroke while I was still shaking, I might as well ask them to run me over with one of the carts. At least I’d save myself the embarrassment of loosing by double digits.

Dan continued. “The top two scorers advance to the back nine, where they will duke it out between each other. The man with the lowest score per foursome at the end of 18 holes will be granted admission into the membership of Preacher’s Pulpit. Any debts you owe to society will be erased by our legal team and you will inherit all rights, honors, and privileges associated with membership. As the kids say, ‘if you want more deets,” hit up Deb Rhiner. She will be available for one hour after the tournament to help fit you for a robe and answer any questions you have about the induction ceremony. If you want a tournament ring, you have to let Deb know. She will be placing our order tomorrow morning so the company we use will be able to make and ship them before the ceremony. Okay?”

The crowd murmured their understanding. The sorry bunch of jailbirds and losers didn’t look like they’d be much for competition, which was fine by me. Preferred, actually. Those rights, honors, and privileges were exactly what I needed to undue some of my mistakes and get Duke back. Preacher’s Pulpit isn’t an ordinary country club. They got something hiding in the basement. Under that castle they call a clubhouse. Something as old as the Ojibwe that used to call these plains their home.

“Okay?” Dan asked again. 

“Okay!” shouted the crowd in unison. 

Dan smiled. *Private jet*. “Let’s light this candle.”

  
\*\*\*

  
Dan asked the computer programmers to go first since Ponytail had blown the head off one of our members. 

“It makes a lot of sense,” Dan said. “Logistically speaking. Three guys play so much faster than four. Keeps us from gumming up the works. There’s nothing worse than waiting in the tee box for a group of fat-footers to finish their putts.”

“You want it? You got it,” Ryan said. “Hop to it, guys.” 

Our group leaders were supposed to remain objective, which meant they couldn’t follow us or give one guy advice that they weren’t giving to the others. Preacher’s Pulpit touted their strict meritocracy with great fervor. Only the best man for the job! 

“I’ll see you all on hole 10. Or, at least, I’ll see two of you.”

My hairs stood on end as the words left his mouth. Ryan slipped away, hands in his pockets, head down. The three of us stared at each other, then at the ground, then back at each other. The thing that terrified me the most was that I had no idea how good the other two guys in my threesome were. What if they just happened to be scratch golfers? I didn’t want to think it, but a little voice in my head told me anyway: “Ponytail is going to shoot you in the face.”

“I’ll take the first shot,” one guy said. 

Poor word choice. I grimaced. I probably looked weaker in that moment than I had ever looked before. My shoulders dropped over. My eyes were the size of silver dollars and I could feel the tears welling up behind them. I didn’t want to die. 

The guy lining up to take his shot was tall and dressed in a black polo and checkered black and white pants despite the sun which hung heavy off in the distance. It was just beginning to get hot. Bugs nipped at the back of my neck. I had to swat them away every 30 seconds. Sometimes they’d fly in my ear or get caught in my hair and I’d have to pick them out. In all the excitement, I couldn’t believe I didn’t pack any bug spray. I had sun block, water, protein bars, but no bug spray. Great. The tall guy in black teed up and gave it a few practice swings. 

“Hey,” whispered the guy next to me. He was a real fat guy wearing an XXL Hawaiian button-up with large pineapple decals on it. “My name’s Kevin Johnson. What’s yours?”

“You trying to get us killed?”

“He ain’t even lined up yet. Besides, we’re inaudible.”

“Brent McCloy,” I said. 

“Nice to meet you, Brent McCloy,” he said. Then, as if I forgot, as if I was a moron, he repeated himself. “I’m Kevin Johnson.”

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Normally, I wouldn’t be so arrogant and rude. I guess we all change a little when we’re scared for our lives. Manners go out the window.

The tall guy took his shot. Solid connection. The ball screamed through the air, sailed 150 yards, and started making its descent. It landed on the fairway in front of a sand trap about 80 yards from the green. Not a bad shot. Kevin Johnson went next. His wind-up was big and clunky and probably could’ve been picked up on the Richter scale. His shot was worse. He shanked it past the cart path and into the rough about 120 yards from the green.

He wet his lips and started walking away from the box. The scorekeeper, an old hag in a short white skirt and a pink top whistled at him. “Hey, Fatso. Your tee.” Kevin doubled back, grabbed his tee, and retreated behind the guy in black as fast as he could. His cheeks were red as blood. 

My turn. 

I stood in the box and did a couple of stretches. Twisted my abdomen back and forth like old guys do, holding onto their club for dear life, hoping they don’t throw out their back. In high school I remember reading a book called The Prince. I can’t remember who wrote it, but he advised would-be princes to care deeply about their perceptions. Particularly how they were perceived by their enemies. It was basically an elaborate argument for acting strong when you are weak and acting weak when you are strong. My knees were shaking. My lips were quivering, but I knew I needed to show myself strong. If I had any hope in the world, it would be in faking it until I made it.

“Ever heard of the movie Turbo?” I asked.

The man in black snarled.

Kevin poked his pink, pudgy face around the guy and held up his index finger. “The one with the snails? Sure. My daughter loves that movie.” His voice was almost passive. Hopeless, like he had just realized he might never see his daughter again. I couldn’t tell if he had brought her up on purpose. He could’ve been lying, I suppose, but I was pretty good at spotting liars. Kevin Johnson wasn’t lying, which made him a lot smarter and a lot dumber than what I gave him credit for at first. Dumber because he joined a to-the-death golf tournament when he had a small child still at home, but smart for bringing her up. Now anyone looking to putt Kevin Johnson into an early grave would have to reckon with the idea of robbing some poor little girl of her daddy. Not a bad strategy. People get mushy about stuff like that. I know I do.

I nodded and made like I was gonna take my shot. “The moral message in the movie Turbo is simple,” I said without looking up. “If you just want something more than the next guy, you can have it.” 

The man in black laughed. 

Kevin Johnson said nothing.

I lined up my shot and put the ball five yards ahead of the guy in black. The tournament was underway—and I was going to win—if I didn’t, more people were going to die.

A lot more.
