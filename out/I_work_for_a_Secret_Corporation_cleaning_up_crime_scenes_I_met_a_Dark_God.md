I’ve tried to see Victor as often as possible. He still had his bad days when he lashed out at the staff. Recently when I called to ask to visit, the staff told me he had ‘tried to fold an attendant like a paper crane.’ So, I skipped going over that day.  

My money problems were stressing me out. There was simply not enough to go around for my rent and Victor’s care. I think once he recovered enough to make his own choices, he wouldn’t want me putting my life at risk for him. Because I was human the Corporation put me on easy mostly harmless tasks. And I had almost been killed on the last one. I couldn’t imagine what kind of job they would force him into facing.  

A call came in for a scene clean-up. This time they said an agent they had sent ahead of time to clear the building and he was the one who requested the cleanup. I packed up my supplies wondering what I would be walking into because there hadn’t been that many details.  

I had a feeling it was a busy day for the Corporation. I was transported to a large run-down warehouse in the middle of nowhere without much explanation. I was told to collect the bodies inside and the agent on the scene would deal with transporting them elsewhere. I would then clean the entire building. It was massive and it made me think this would take me a few days, if not a week.  

I stopped in front of the door and gathered myself. Just because I didn’t show it didn’t mean I wasn’t frightened. Anything could be waiting for me.  

I opened a door next to a large locked shutter meant to open for forklifts. Inside was dark and a smell of perfume hit me. It made my eyes water and I took a few seconds to adjust. A hole in the ceiling was the only source of light. Swallowing hard I started through a path towards the person waiting in the light.  

The floor had been covered by countless dead animals gruesomely stitched together. I saw human bodies mixed in with the piles of death near the edge of the light. It made my skin crawl but I kept going.  

“Nice to meet you. I was the one who called this in.” The man said when I stopped near him.  

He stood in a circle empty of the bodies. He hadn’t cleaned up a spot beforehand. Rather, the person who laid all the bodies out left pathways and small clean openings. He held out his hand but mine were frozen by my side.  

I had a bag with my cleaning supplies over my shoulder. I held onto the strap tightly as my eyes went over what I could see of the room.  

“Where do we even start?” I said mostly to myself.  

“There is a larger door through that pathway there and on the other side of the building. We should start over there.” He said as he gestured towards a clear path leading into the darkness.  

The pale skin of his wrist and forearm made an alarm bell go off in my head. I nodded at his suggestion but didn’t move as I carefully studied his appearance. Unlike the other agents I have met, his suit jacket didn’t fit. It was small. His movements were stiff because of it. He wasn’t wearing suit pants, just normal black jeans. Hell, he didn’t even have a button-down shirt on under his jacket.   

My expression didn’t give away my suspicions but the movement of my hand to my pocket did. His bright smile faded from his face and his hands shot out. For a tall skinny bastard, he was strong as hell. I thrashed trying to get free but he easily wrapped an arm around my torso and pinned mine to my side. He struggled with me to steal away my phone and tossed it into the mess of bodies. I was then lifted off the ground as he carried me down the pathway I kicked and tried biting to get free.  

I was simply overpowered. No one was expecting me to finish this job for days. Would Samus check up on me? Would anyone even know if I died here until hours passed? I needed to think of a plan.  

He silently carried me over to something so horrifying it made me stop fighting for a moment. The bodies all lead to a dark and twisted shrine located in the middle of the building. We were far away from the sunlight. Hundreds of candles bathed the area in an orange glow that discolored the blood-stained floor.  

A tower of tied-together bones reached far off into the darkness. The agent that this man had stolen the jacket from had been bound to the tower with thick thorned wire. His throat cut letting black blood freely flow from the wound. Silver bowls sat on the ground collecting the blood. At the bottom of the tower was an odd flickering jagged light. It was dark with a strange crackling noise coming from it as it moved erratically.   

I was tossed to the floor hard enough to sprain my wrist when I broke my fall. The bound man moved slightly but didn’t raise his head. He was still alive which was good but we both didn’t have a lot of time. The man who dragged me away ambushed the agent, stole his phone, and called for more victims.  

“I was expecting an entire crew and they send a single little girl? How understaffed in this place?” He said in a false sing son voice.  

“What is the point of all this?” I asked voice calm but I didn’t dare stand up just yet.  

He didn’t appear pleased I wasn’t begging for my life.   

“The point? Can’t you tell this is art? Are you asking an artist to explain his work?” He said and spread his arms out to his side.  

A burst of light came as thousands of hidden candles came to life on their own. My breath caught as I saw the sheer horror surrounding it.  

The bodies didn’t just cover the floors but they were stuck to the walls and ceiling as well. The sight was enough to make me dizzy. I shook my head trying to clear it. Although most of the bodies were animals, there had to be over a few hundred human bodies mixed into the mass of death. How did he kill so many of them without being noticed? I looked harder and realized that most of these bodies weren’t fresh. If this man wasn’t human then that meant he would have had years and years to work on this feat. The warehouse looked to be at least a hundred years old with some newer updates here and there. Had he been working on this for that long?  

“Well? Isn't it all beautiful?” The monster smugly said.  

“I think you’re trying too hard to be edgy.” I replied in a deadpan voice.  

That was not the response he wanted. I heard him sputter like a dying fish, his face turning red.   

“You! This was all in service of the greatest dark God any world has ever known! I was going to use your blood in service of him but you do not deserve that honor!”  

He was clearly losing his cool. I glanced around trying to think of something. I needed to get the hell out of here but I couldn’t leave behind the still bleeding agent. That man left me no choice but to fight instead of flee. He lunged forward aiming for my throat.  

I gripped the weapon in my pocket and waited until he was close enough to strike. I stabbed the pen as hard as I could into his stomach causing him to cry out in pain. I then pushed the button to extend the pen into a blade to bury it deeper into his flesh.  

He stumbled backward and I wasted no time running around him towards the bound agent. I tore off my jacket and used it to protect my hands to pull away the wire holding him to the tower. It wasn’t properly made so it came crumbling down in seconds. It was a miracle I dragged the injured man away and didn’t get buried under a mountain of bones.  

My attacker hissed sounding like a wild animal. He ripped the dagger from his stomach tossing it aside.   

“You witch!” He screamed and it was a pretty mild insult all things considered.  

He could fill an entire building with the dead and yet he couldn’t swear? He might have had some stronger words for me but something distracted us both. The bloody blade he tossed aside landed directly inside the twisting crackling line of dark light.  

Sparks flew from it and the light expanded showing an alien landscape beyond. That man had created a rip between worlds, but it had opened somewhere he didn’t want. He screamed and raced towards the rip but wasn’t able to get close due to the sheer raw power coming from it.  

“No, no, no! Not yet! It's not in the right spot!” He shouted fighting against the harsh current in the air.  

I should have been more worried. I focused on dragging away the agent until I was forced not to.  

The air suddenly grew still. Everything around us froze in place. Every cell in my body screamed in fear as an unseen force took over.   

The orange light of the candles appeared dimmer. A pitch-black clawed hand came from the rip and took hold of the side.  I don’t think words could ever explain the feeling this darkness brought into the world. It was as if all joy had faded from existence leaving only a hollow empty feeling.  

Slowly the thing emerged. It was a Dark God but not the one the crazy man had wanted.  

A head made of dark tendrils came through. An ancient cracked skull of a long-extinct animal rested where a face should be. The body appeared to be mostly human with skin darker than the night. The legs were that of a beast and a long tail was the last thing to come into view. The creature first seemed to be seven feet tall, then a pair of dark wings spread out behind it.  

I knew it wasn’t possible but this creature appeared larger than the space it occupied. The wings might as well stretch past the sky. I had thought the infected corpse was terrifying. This creature was simply fear itself.  

The man fell to his knees, face pale and teeth chattering. His mind is on the verge of breaking.  

“M-y  Lord F-fee...” He said and stiffly bowed his head with tears in his eyes.  

Fee? Was that this thing's name? The monster directed an eyeless glance downwards to the man causing him to tremble so hard he wasn’t able to do anything else.  

“I made all this for you!” He shouted trying to get on the God’s good side.  

The massive form took a step closer and the body shark back down to its seven-foot-tall size. He paced on clawed feet, the skull moving to look over the room. It was impossible to tell if it was pleased or not.  

“I even prepared two playthings for you.”   

My head shot in that bastard's direction offended. The jerk was handing us over to save his skin. Suddenly a clawed hand was in front of my face. I didn’t even see that God move and yet he was right there ready to take me. If I let it touch me, then I would be subjected to torture no human could even dream of.  

“Fuck off.”  

My words were stern and void of the fear I felt. I was too scared to even shake so I just stared down the God in front of me. For once, my lack of an expressive face paid off. The hand paused but then started to get closer. My hand snapped up slapping it away as if I was dealing with a pesky sibling.  

The silence was deafening. We all sat at a standstill waiting for each other to react.  

Finally, it was broken by a long loud laughter coming from the skull. The Dark God bent over from laughing so hard.  

The killer’s mouth fell open, mind broken by the reaction. Fee reached out to try and touch me again. I kept slapping the hand away until he got the message.  

“Ok, I like you.” The God admitted speaking for the first time.  

I didn’t know if that was a good thing or not.  

“What?! Her! She disrespected you and I did all this!” The man shouted rising to his feet.  

Fee crossed his arms and the skull moved around to take in the room again.  

“Don’t you think you’re trying too hard to be edgy?” Fee commented.  

I didn’t think I would agree with a nightmare creature over anything let alone something like this. The man’s face turned red from rage and he charged forwards. His body shifted into something more animalistic ready to kill.   

Fee waved a hand and the threat was dragged away into the floor by countless dark tentacles. They were nice enough to leave behind the stolen suit jacket.  

“Anyway.” Fee said directing his skull toward me.  

I tightened my protective hold over the fallen agent. Sure, I wasn’t dead but that didn’t mean I was out of the woods just yet. This agent needed medical treatment soon or else he wasn’t going to make it.  

“Hand that one over. I need to mess him up.” Fee demanded making a grabby hand motion.  

“You can shove that idea directly in your ass.” I stated.  

He shrugged cracking his neck. The pressure came back into the air as if slowly came down on my shoulders threatening to suffocate me. Fee got down to my level, the tip of the skull inches away from my nose.  

“The one who foolishly made an open gate for me to hijack is a simple person. I can break him in a few months if not weeks. An agent is a different story. He'll take longer. I need a toy. If I get bored then I start taking it out on everyone else. Now, what would you rather do? This world be slowly thrown into nightmares beyond imagination, or for you to forfeit a single life?”  

His words echoed through my brain. The pressure became so intense I almost folded. It hurt. Just being near him made my skin feel as it if was melting off. I gritted my teeth and kept my head raised to stare into the dark empty sockets.  

“Just watch Netflix like everyone else if you’re that bored.” I said struggling to get my words out.  

The pressure in the air snapped back to normal. Fee’s demeanor changed and his body relaxed.  

“Oh shit, this world has Netflix?” He asked and stood back up.  

“There are other worlds?” I pressed still trying to recover.  

“Well, duh. Why do you think the Corporation is so busy?”  

My head swam from the answer. In such a short amount of time, I’ve found out there were supernatural creatures and an organization that keeps them in line. Dark Gods and now different worlds out there.  

“Are they all like this one?” I said wondering if there was a world out there with another version of myself.  

Was Victor changing into something else always meant to happen? Or was he happy somewhere else?   

“Hell, if I know. I’m sure there is a lot that are but I don’t pay attention to what you humans do for the most part. All I care about is booze, porn, and true crime dramas. Man, I’m like a basic white bitch when it comes to true crime dramas.”  

I let myself raise an eyebrow at him. I don’t think I liked this so-called dark God too much.   

“That’s good to know. I need to leave and get this guy to the doctor.”  

I started to drag the fallen agent backward again but only got a few steps when the pressure came down. It froze my muscles no matter how hard I fought against it.   

“I don’t think Netflix will be enough to keep me from having fun with this world. I need something else to keep my boredom at bay. What are you offering?” Fee said in a low raspy voice that suited his title.  

“I have an old 3DS and a lot of games.” I tried.  

“Cute. But not enough. Why don’t you do the world a favor and offer yourself?” He suggested.  

I was too scared to raise my head and I hated myself for it. Sweat started on my back as a chill went through my body.  

“In what way?” I asked voice somehow staying calm.  

“It’s simple. Keep doing this job. Involved yourself in the most interesting events as you’re able, and then hand over your memories to me.”  

I finally looked up. Confusion took over my fear.   

“Why would care about something like that?” I said not understanding the request.  

“I'll let you try and figure that out. That’s my deal. I’ll come to you whenever I feel like it. It could be six months or a year. In exchange for yourself, I’ll spare this world. And I mean that. You’ll lose everything you are when I take away your memories.”  

I chewed on my cheek debating on what to do. I didn’t have any power here. If I refused, he could easily crush every living thing on the planet and then move on.   

“Will you let me think about it?”   

Fee laughed again at my words. I doubted he had too many humans talk to him in the way I had been. It might be what saved my life.   

“Fine. I’ll show up again in the future and ask you again. Yourself or this world. Oh, and I would suggest you not tell anyone about this encounter. I’m a big deal and The Corporation may give you a hard time if they knew you lived being in the same room with me. Later Gator.”  

I blinked then the God was gone. Simple as that. My body fell into terrible shakes that lasted for a few minutes. I needed to collect myself before I dug around in the left-behind suit jacket to find the agent's phone.  

Another couple of minutes passed and then more agents came charging into the building. Samus and Toff were with them. Both of the men swept me up in an embarrassing hug. Samus near tears apologized I was sent into such a bad situation and Toff appeared angry with himself for not being there to help. I wonder if this is what having older brothers was like.  

I needed to fill out a lot of paperwork. I didn’t tell anyone about the deal I made with Fee, or that he even showed up. I lied saying the killer had been dragged into the weird portal by a monster I didn’t get a clear look at and left it at that. Lupa asked that I repeat my story to him. His eyes narrowed as if he knew I was lying but he didn’t voice his concerns.  

A few days passed before I was able to see the injured agent from the building. I met him inside a clinic run by The Corporation. His face was pale and his neck bandaged but he looked much better than I expected. I heard he liked books so I picked up a few used paperback ones instead of some flowers.  

“I’m sorry that you were put into such a dangerous situation. I should have been stronger.” He admitted in a soft voice when I entered the room.  

“I'm glad we both got out of there alive.” I told him but he didn’t appear like he had forgiven himself. “If you beat up that guy then we might not have met and become friends.”  

That cheered him up. The door opened directing our attention towards a man walking inside. He looked around my age with dark hair and Asian features. If he put more weight on his thin frame, he would be fairly handsome.  

“Seren, the doctor said you’re able to come home tonight. Do you want me to stay with you until check out?” The man asked after he gave a polite nod in my direction.  

“Are you two dating?”   

I wasn’t sure why I asked that. Normally I didn’t care about that sort of thing.  

“No.”  

“Yes.”  

They both spoke at once. Seren was the one who agreed and then became mortified by his answer. The other man looked over at the poor embarrassed agent and then back towards me.  

“Maybe.” He corrected and then sat on the edge of the bed. “Can we talk?” He asked.  

I peaced out a few seconds afterward leaving them alone, Seren looking as if he regretted that I saved his life.  

After all that I didn’t want to keep doing this job. But I needed to pay my bills and, you know, the whole fate of the world now rested on my shoulders.   

I don’t think I could stay motivated through all this if I didn’t have the support of the people around me. Even if some of them could be a bit overbearing. At the moment, I’m still ready to face death every day for these people.
