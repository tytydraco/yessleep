Look, I know, this is the last platform that will offer me any sympathy but please hear me out, I need your help! 

I started a new account posting Reddit videos on the TikTok app a few months back, mainly due to the amount of similar accounts that were on there that seemed to do well. I had previously come across a post from someone showing you how to make this style of video, it was titled ‘How to get Followers quick’. The man in the video explained how you would have access to unlimited Reddit content, to post daily with minimal effort. I uploaded my first five videos that day and was seeing real numbers in terms of likes, comments and followers. 

I passed 7000 followers in my first week and was posting 4 to 5 videos a day. I did mention the Original Poster’s username at the bottom and in the cut out of their post. Maybe looking back I should have asked for permission but at the time I felt this was enough. It would also hinder the amount of videos I could upload per day, as I’d have to wait for replies.

Within a 3 month period I had amassed a following of 345k, I was also making good enough money off this exposure to enjoy my nights out. 

I got the first message 2 weeks ago and this is what it read: 

‘Hello, 

I have noticed you have taken a couple of my posts from the NoSleep forum, my username is NoSecrets. I would kindly request you remove these videos as I haven’t given you permission to use them.

Thank you,

OP.’

I read it full of cockiness and humour, I didn’t even respond back as I didn’t see it worth my time. I deleted it and carried on making my 3rd post of the day.

Two days passed and things were going  well, I had gained another 10,000 followers, the post by the user that had messaged me was getting my profile a lot of attention! It had nearly 9 million views and 800,000 likes, I credited all of the users that posted the content in my video anyway, why complain, I’m doing you a favour. Getting your creativity out there!

I then received the second message from the same user:

‘Hi again,

Look. I have tried to be nice about this but you need to remove the video of my post. now.

If you do not remove it, there will, be consequences. 

You have been warned. 

You have 24 hours.’

Wow, I thought to myself, can you believe the audacity of this guy. I couldn’t resist sending them a message back:

‘Hey, 

I have credited you on the video, and in the caption, there shouldn’t be an issue?

Don’t threaten me or I will report you. 

Don’t message me again.’

I thought that would do the trick, how dare he confront me. Does he not see how well his post is doing, he should be flattered. 

I immediately received a response from them:

‘24 hours, remove it!’

I scoffed, is this guy for real? I just ignored it. 

The next day, I had three loud knocks on my apartment door, I answered it, but weirdly no one was there. I looked down to see a small package placed on my door mat. I picked it up confused, it had my name and details on it. But I wasn’t expecting anything, and normally the mailman would buzz the intercom if I had a delivery. I opened it in anticipation.

Beneath the crumpled layers of brown paper, a small wooden figurine stared back at me. It was a carved Buddhist monk, sat cross legged, in the lotus position, its eyes closed. It was covered in strange scrawled writing, it looked like some kind of ancient script. It just looked freaky, like a bad omen you would find in a fantasy horror film. I started to have an uneasy feeling like something wasn’t quite right. I didn’t like it, so I threw the wooden ornament away in the outside trash. I wasn’t keeping that thing anywhere near me. 

Later that night, as I was scrolling through Reddit looking for new content, I heard quiet footsteps coming from my hallway. The footsteps were followed by slight creaking noises that whined under my door. I muted the TV, and listened intently. Then, knock, knock, knock. My door rattled with every thump. It was 11pm, who the hell could it be. I decided, I was going to ignore it, whoever it was would leave soon. A few minutes passed and just as my breath had began to normalise it sounded out again, ‘knock, knock, knock’. This time I jumped up and grabbed a large kitchen knife from the block. 

I made my way over to the front door, keeping my footsteps as soft as possible. I peered through the peephole, my searching eye was only met by a dark empty corridor. I slowly twisted open the lock and carefully turned the handle. I pulled the door open slightly, while clenching the knife in my right hand, my arm  shook uncontrollably. I peered my head out, looked both ways down the hall and down the proceeding stairwell. I cautiously stepped out for a better view, there was no one there. It was all deathly silent apart from the muffled sound of neighbouring TV’s. 

I hurried in and locked the door once again, I felt a sudden wave of relief through my body as I walked back into the living room. This feeling didn’t last long, I stopped in terror as I stared at my coffee table. There sat, facing me was the small wooden figurine I had threw out earlier. This couldn’t be possible, was someone playing some kind of joke on me! I swung my head back as I heard someone whispering behind me, it was inaudible but echoing from my bathroom. I hesitantly made my way over. The door was slightly ajar and for a split second, I saw a shadowy figure looking at me through the crack. I couldn’t make out any prominent features but someone was definitely in there. I had a fight or flight moment, I ran at the door, I kicked it open, the knife, still clutched in my hand. 

I was then stood in my empty bathroom, panting, from a mixture of fear and adrenaline. It was nearing midnight and decided I would call my dad, asking whether I could stay over. I wasn’t going to spend my night in here, that was for sure. I made an excuse that my hot water had stopped and it wouldn’t be fixed till the morning. To be honest, I didn’t even want to go back to my apartment. 

I got set up in my old childhood bedroom. I opened up my TikTok app, I had forgotten to post any more videos. I didn’t care.  I just passed out on my bed. 

The next morning, I woke up and checked the app again, I had a new message in my inbox. It was sent in the early hours of the morning, from the same user. 

‘I warned you of the consequences! No one can help you now. ‘ 

I freaked out, I tried to report the user, but later that day the account was no longer there. I then went to their Reddit profile, it was already gone. In the days after, I couldn’t face staying in that apartment again. I ended up cancelling the lease and moved in with my dad. The strange terrifying occurrences seemed to follow me, and so did that wretched figurine. In the middle of the night I would feel my bedsheets move and tug. The en-suite bathroom door would fly open when I entered the bedroom. And worst of all, every time I would throw away that monk figurine, even chucking it into a river, it would end up sat, nestled upon my pillow the same evening. I shut down my account soon after and I even deleted the app, trying everything to make it stop. It hasn’t, if anything it’s getting worse. 

Please help me, I just don’t know what to do, and I can’t take much more of this!

Now, I’m begging you. If you ever get a message like this, take it seriously. Delete the video. Apologize. Do whatever they ask. Because if you don’t… you’ll hear the knocking too.
