After that day, I began spending all my time either at work or driving around in my truck. I couldn’t trust my house anymore, especially with the unknown territory I had recently ran into. I began carrying around a little pocketbook with me where I would jot down theories and observations I had about my situation so far. One of the ideas I spent the most time on was how there was possibly two creatures living in my house; one in the crawl space and one upstairs. If that was the case, how did they both have the same voice; my voice.


Thinking about it for long periods of time made me get anxious to the point where I didn’t even feel safe in my heavily populated store, but I could do nothing else. Every part of my day was consumed by it. It felt as if the thing would eventually crawl out of my head and finally relieve me of this torture. Even in my woodworking, I began creating crawling, monstrous creatures. There truly was nothing else on my mind.


I’d traveled back to the house just once at that point in order to get some clothes and my toothbrush. I was in and out of the place so fast, I was hardly able to process how the fog from the upstairs hallway had begun spilling onto the descending staircase. “It’s a work in progress” I told myself as I slammed the front door behind me.


Eileen’s asks to hang out never stopped either in those 4 days I was living in my car. She would sometimes suggest spending the night at her apartment, and while the offer made me heart lighten every time I heard it, the thought of the creature following me there and tormenting her in her own place never left me. To get her to stop worrying about me, I suggested we go on a coffee date at lunchtime.


​I watched as Eileen enter the old-timey café with an excitement at the sight of me. Her curly brown hair bounced with each step and when she arrived at my table by the large window, I stood up and pulled her in for a hug. When we released we sat in our seats across from one another.


​“I missed you.” She said.


​“I missed you too.” I responded, chugging my coffee, trying to stay awake. I’d gotten only an hour of sleep last night; I couldn’t stop thinking.


​“So how was your day so far?” She asked.


​“Pretty good.” Disappointment slowly poured across her face. “I mean I haven’t done much. Just went to work and stuff.” I gave my best smile to her, but I knew how fake it looked. “What have you been up to today?” I asked, trying to get the attention off of myself. She perked up and grabbed my hand; I felt my body grow less tense as she did so.


​“It’s been alright.” She said. “I talked with my Mom over the phone this morning. What she said to me when I visited her really hurt my feelings, and I didn’t want it to run our relationship, so I felt that I might as well talk to her about it. She said she was still upset that I decided to live so far away but she could live with it, and she told me that she’d come visit more, ‘cause she’s about to retire. I asked her if she could give the phone to my Dad so I could talk to him too about the problems, but he told my mom he was busy or whatever, but he didn’t even give her an excuse.”

I only half listened to what she said afterwards. My attention went from her face to over her shoulder, directed at the door to the employee lounge. A customer opened the door, but a worker walked up to him and pointed him to the bathroom.


This little interaction set off an idea in my head; what if the creature couldn’t leave the fog? The line it had drawn in the hallway only ended at the point where the fog did as well. It also would only enter rooms in which the fog had entered. 

Maybe that was the reason the fog kept expanding; the creature wants more space to move, it wants to dominate my house. What would happen if that fog were to go away? I had already tried to clear it when it first started spreading, but what if I tried again, and made sure it stayed away? I know Russel’s Everything Fix has air purifiers you can install, I could ask him to put those in, and then I could just wait until the creature, or creatures, were corned; that’s when I would take care of them.
I pulled out my pocketbook and began writing my thoughts down, but I was interrupted by the sound of my girlfriend’s voice. “Bruce, what are you doing?” I looked up to find her befuddled expression as she looked down towards my pocketbook.


“Nothing.” I said, putting the book away. “I just got an idea for a wood working project, didn’t wanna lose it.”


“Oh.” Eileen said. “Are you sure nothing’s up?”


“Of course. Why?” Agitation began building up inside of me.


“You seem off, and you’re hardly looking at me when I talk. You don’t even seem like you’re here.” I crossed my arms and leaned back in my chair.


“Wow. I’m not able to hang out with you for one week and you get all pissy like this.”


“What?”


“You’re just projecting your own problems onto me; I’m fine. It’s called being busy, but you wouldn’t know much about that.” Shock covered her face as she looked into my eyes. I stood up and shook my head at her. “I think you could use some space from me; you need to learn what it’s like to not hang on my shoulder 24/7.” I stormed out of the restaurant and hopped into my car, unsure as to what I’d just done.


In the next two days, I’d gotten everything prepared to take this thing down. I wanted to invite Russell over to install those air purifiers, but first I needed to cover up that scratch in the upstairs hallway. I bought a long, cheap rug at a department store one night, and traveled over to my house. When I opened the door, I saw that the fog from the crawl space had filled about 3/4’s of my living room and the fog from storage space was halfway down the stairs. 

I didn’t hear or see anything out of the usual, besides noting the pure thickness of the fog as I set up the rug. I worried it would be hard for Russell to work it was so dense, but I figured a guy like him could manage.


As I began opening the front door, I heard yelling, but not the yelling I’d expected when entering the place; it was from Joey’s house. I looked through a window and saw as Joey stormed out of his house and yell out “Bitch!” when he entered his car. I thought he was going to instantly peel out of his driveway, but what I saw shocked me to my core; he began to cry. His cry quickly turned to a sob, and though I could hardly hear a thing, I saw the pain and regret in his appearance as he put his face in his vein-ridden hands.


I waited 20 minutes in my foyer until he finished, promptly turned on his car, and peeled out of there.


I exited my house, letting the moonlight shine down upon me. I observed the burn marks upon Joey’s otherwise pristine driveway, and wondered what could have led him to do such a thing.


The next morning, I woke up in my truck, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and headed into work. I conducted everything as normal. Crafted a sign someone’s mom would love, talked to customers, and didn’t even write a single thing in my pocketbook. The only difference in the day was how I never failed to take a peek through my front window to look at Russell’s Everything Fix across the street. I felt I should wait until the end of the day to ask him to come over because I knew it’d take the most time and I didn’t want Russell to get mad at me for taking his time away from other customers. I knew the guy loved his job and he didn’t have a wife or family at home to get to, so I figured it was the best option to just wait.


5:00 PM finally came. I closed up shop and headed across the street, entering the brick building with a nervousness I always had when I was around Russell ever since I was a kid. His blue-walled store was fairly barren, only filled with tan metal shelves carrying some basic tools, but the main attraction of the place was what the man behind the counter could do for you. Russell was wearing his iconic denim overalls and button-up I’d seen him wear for my entire life. His moustache was still thick, but it’d grown much grayer than the last time I’d talked to him. He was counting his cash for the day as I grabbed his attention.


“Hey Russell, how are things with the store?” Russell simply responded with an ambiguous grunt without a single glance upwards. “If you’re up for it, I’ve got a job for you.”


“Can’t you see I’m closin’ up, son? I can do it for ya’ tomorrow.”


“It’s urgent.” Suspicion shot across the old man’s eyes.


“Urgent?”


“Yeah” I said. “The air quality in my house has gotten really bad lately. It looks like some big fog is all over my house, and it’s been spreading for weeks now. 


I’ve been sleeping in my car recently because I think I’ll get sick if I stay there too long.” The suspicion from Russell’s eyes still shot into me even after my explanation. “I was wondering if you could help me with some air purifiers to clear the place out.” I added.


“If you can’t put up a couple of air purifiers in your house, you’ve got lot bigger problems than ‘fog,’ son.” He said with that same frown I’d seen for years. My annoyance started to rise as it always did when dealing with the man, but I managed to stay externally cool.
“I don’t want those little ones you sell out here, I want a few that you can install onto the walls.” Russell sighed and pointed to a few installable air purifiers in the corner.


“How about I just sell these to ya’ and you can do it yourself.”


“I don’t know how, that’s why I need you to do it.” Russell looked down at his money again,


“Figures.” He muttered. “Well, I walked to work today so I don’t know how I’m supposed to get to your place.”


“I can drive you.” I said dryly.


“Fine.” Russell put the money back in the register. “Let me get my toolbox and we’ll carry those purifiers out.” He watched as I walked over to the box, and as I bent down, I heard a “You sure you can handle that?” from my new partner. I shot a blank look over in his direction and picked up both purifiers at once with a bit of a struggle.


On the drive over, I got a call from Eileen: the fifth one since our coffee date. I pressed ignore and refocused my attention on driving; it’d have to be a problem for another day.
We arrived at my front door, and as we entered, disgust poured over Russell’s face. “How in the hell did you let it get this bad, boy?” The fog had nearly completed its crawl through the living room and was also now over halfway down the stairs. Turning on the glass chandelier didn’t do much to help with sight, leading Russell to pull out a medical mask from his toolbox and put it on.


“You think you can fix it with these air purifiers?” I asked.


“Of course, but this is still ridiculous.” He gave me that same disappointed look again. “Where do you want ‘em at?”


“Kitchen and the upstairs hallway.” We made our way through the nearly fog covered living room and into the barely visible kitchen. I could see the discomfort on Russell’s face as he trudged through. “Everything ok?” I asked.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t it be.” He grunted. We chose a spot on the wall, opened the box, and Russell began putting the purifier together. I was the one who handed the tools to him when he called for them, something I’d been for him when I was a kid. I could hardly see a thing, and if my theory was correct about the creature, it could have been in any one of the surrounding rooms. 

One thing I knew for certain was that I couldn’t allow Russell to be by himself; he’d be too vulnerable by himself.


I looked towards the door to the crawl space and found it spewing out more fog at a rapid pace, leading me to walk over and close it so as for it not to look odd. Russell noticed my quick movement. “What was that about?”
“Nothing. Is this going to take a while.”
“It takes what it takes.”


“Ok, but can I have an estimate? I just want to sleep here tonight.”


“Stop getting your little panties in a bunch. I’m the one taking time out of my busy day to help you out of this mess you threw yourself into, so can ya’ just hand me the damn tools.” I wanted to punch the old asshole in the stomach, but I needed him to put these things up so I could take my house back.


After about thirty minutes of assembly, the thing was near completion. Russell asked for a large screw, but I couldn’t find it within the box or in his bag. “Oh lord, just let me do it.” He said as he pushed me aside. Russell couldn’t find the thing either. “Sorry son can’t do it tonight. Don’t have the right screw.” I almost laughed in disbelief.


“You don’t have the right stuff? What’s that you always told me as a kid about a good man always being prepared?”


“I don’t need this lip, especially from you. Just a little sissy boy that don’t know how to use a wrench; it’s not hard!”


“Why can’t you ever just shut up about how you can do things and I can’t? It’s all you’ve ever talked about.” Russell rose from his knees and pointed his finger in my face.


“You better back off, son. I’ve had enough of you. You’ve been breathing down my neck all night. Just buzz off and let me gather my tools.” I wanted to hurt the old bastard, but I restrained myself. I turned around, walked through the living room and foyer, climbed the stairs, and washed my face in the bathroom. I took a drink from the faucet and cleared out my mouth. I looked in the mirror and saw myself for the first time in months. The bags under my eyes had grown significantly and my beard was more out of control than ever.


“AHHH!” It came from downstairs. I turned off the water and careened down the staircase, stopping in the foyer. I saw the red creep towards me, it crept so much faster than the fog. It stained the carpet my parents got me, it stained my boots, it stained everything. The creature was bent into Russell’s neck as he lay limp on the floor.


I finally got a good look at the thing. Mouths. So many mouths. On its arms, in the chest, across it’s legs, on the tops of its feet and hands. There was a mouth everywhere except where one should be. Some of them had sharp teeth, others more human like. There were ones with long reaching tounges while a few were simple black caverns of pure white teeth. Regardless of their differences, all were in constant motion. They were mouthing words, chopping, frowning; anything I could think of. They never stopped moving. 


The thing had 8 limbs, three on each side and two on the bottom. They were spindly and weak looking, but from what the creature had just done, I knew that not to be the case. On the end of each limb, three fingers shot out with gnarled nails sprouting out almost double the length of the fingers. The eyes embedded near the top of its head were small, red, and surrounded my tiny, veracious mouths. It’s color was composed of a deep red mixed with purple. Veins stretched across it’s body in that same putrid color. It looked like it was in agony and seemed as if it had no concept of the agony it had caused me.


The creature stood up on its hind legs and cautiously walked to the edge of the fog, staring at me for minutes on end. It seemed as if my theory about the thing and the fog was being proven, but my excitement wasn’t present. The only thought on my mind was how to get Russell’s body out of my house, but this problem was solved for me as the creature backed away, got down on all of its limbs, and scurried out. Without wasting anymore time, I sprinted the few feet over to Russell’s body and dragged him back into the safety of the foyer. I continued to drag him out of the front door, and making sure to lock it, until I reached my truck, where I put him in the bed and sped off. As I drove away, I couldn’t help but realize it wouldn’t be long until that thing could reach the front door and it would be able to break the glass within it with ease.


I made sure to take the country roads to my destination; no one needed to look in my truck bed. My truck stopped outside of my shop, and I almost got out, but the weariness of my back made me long to sleep in a bed for possibly my last time. I put the truck in drive and headed towards the nearest motel.
The sun had long set after I got my room key and drove to where I’d be spending the night. Getting out of the truck, I saw the old man’s face; pure shock and pain was placed upon it. There were several bite marks through his overalls and button-up so deep I saw the ripped flesh lying beneath. By the looks of it, he’d bled out before I even had the time to drag him out of the living room. I couldn’t look at his horrified face any longer and lucky for me I saw the cover for my truck bed curled up beside him. I put the cover on and headed into my dingy yet fog free room.


I sat down on the bed, prompting dust to fly across the room, making my heart race for a moment till it quickly dissipated in the air. It hadn’t been too long since the last time I’d been in a motel; about a month ago at that point. The thought of that motel wriggled its way into my brain, and I couldn’t get it to leave.
That night, I got together with my old friend, and we went out drinking at some of the dingy little dive bars we would always drive past as high schoolers. It took a while, but my friend got absolutely hammered and I decided it was best if we ended the night there. I didn’t want to wake either of our parents in the dead of the night, so I led us to the only motel in town, surrounding by a dense forest. 


When we arrived, I ordered a room for us, got the key, and helped my friend inside where he instantly crashed onto the disgusting sheets. I wasn’t too tired yet, so I decided to go out to the black-top parking lot to get some fresh air. It was incredibly quiet that night, the only thing I could hear was the buzzing of the tall red neon sign that read “CHEAP ROOMS.”  


It took a few moments of silence, but eventually I could hear a painful groan coming from the nearby forest. I turned, and found a kid, holding his stomach, crawl out and stumble into the parking lot. I ran over to him, helped him get up, but he kept falling back over. I finally got him to lean against the side of the motel and found a splotch of blood spreading onto his blue-striped shirt. He looked to only be about 8 or 9. 


Instantly, I pulled out my phone and called the police. While they were on their way, I asked him what happened, and through sharp breaths, he managed to get out that a man had kidnapped him a few hours ago in a van, and as he managed to escape, the man had stabbed him. The kid said he’d been trudging through the woods for nearly an hour now, walking towards the red neon sign in the distance. I knelt down next to him and told him it was going to be ok, but I wasn’t sure of that as the blood continued to spread.


An ambulance eventually arrived, and as they picked the boy up, he gave me a face of desperation; I wanted to help him, but I didn’t know how. People began exiting their rooms to see what the commotion was about, all except for my friend, but I knew he wouldn’t be up ‘till morning.  Before they could even close the doors to the ambulance, one of the paramedics looked to the others and gave one of the gravest faces I’d ever seen. A police car pulled up soon after, leaving me to be questioned by them. 

After a few brief answers from myself, the cop closed his pocketbook and watched as I gazed towards the ambulance driving down the highway; its siren was silent. The cop patted me on my shoulder and gave me a nonchalant, “You’ll walk it off, pal.” The officers left to search for the man as the residents began returning to their peaceful sleeps, leaving me in the parking lot, unsure of what to do next. I looked to my room behind me, and the thought of telling my friend crossed my mind, but I realized he didn’t need to be bothered with this; no one deserves that. I took one last gaze at the now empty parking lot before heading into the room. It was incredibly foggy that night.


I finally escaped my thoughts as I laid my tired head to rest; it couldn’t possibly think more if it tried. The sun crept into the room and struck me in the face. I slowly rose and felt as refreshed as I possibly could have been in that moment. I’d have to return to the house that day; the thing was nearly to the front door, and I couldn’t let it out.


That morning, I began jotting down my attack plan for the night. After a few hours, I checked out and headed over to my shop for more preparation. I didn’t open up that day; I couldn’t handle the distractions. There, I grabbed my tools, including my buzz saw, wrench, hammer, and a flashlight. I also grabbed a hunting knife for extra protection. Lastly, I began creating a trap for the thing; it took me about an hour to make it as well as think of the best place to put it. On the way out, I made sure to grab a can of gasoline and a box of matches to put the trap into full effect.
On the way to my house, I got another call from Eileen, which I promptly ignored.


The sun was starting to set and as I turned onto my street, I saw something I didn’t expect; Joey unlocked my door and headed inside. Was he actually planning on ‘taking care of my mouse problem?’ How the hell did he get in? Pulling into the driveway, I recalled how when I first moved in, I had given his wife a spare key in case of emergencies, but I didn’t think he’d actually use that for something as idiotic as this.


As I pulled into my driveway and headed towards the house, I looked back at my truck and realized I hadn’t thought about Russell all morning. Maybe it was because of what I was dealing with or maybe it was because I was able  enjoy the unjudgmental silence.
I readjusted my duffel bag filled with my supplies, took the hunting knife out, and prepared for entry. Upon opening the unlocked door, I found the fog to have nearly reached the front door mat in my foyer. The only light came from the sunset coming through the few windows in the house. I looked around in a hurried panic and found nothing besides a fog that had grown even thicker since last night. 


My slamming and locking of the front door prompted Joey’s head to pop out of the living room. Before he could notice, I put the knife back into my pocket. “There you are! I was waiting for a call to tell me not to come all morning, but I got zip, so here I am, pal.” He was wearing the same clothes he’d worn when I saw him storm out of his house two nights prior. Joey gestured to the air, “Looks like you couldn’t figure out how to fix that dry ice machine. I’ll get that fixed for you too after I stomp the little bastards.” He raised his steel toe boots out of the fog on the floor so I could get a better look. The foyer carpet was still partially stained with dry blood, but Joey clearly wasn’t able to take note of it. “By the way, you need to change these lightbulbs, none of ‘em are working.” The creature must have cut off the power.


“Look, man, you need to get out here.” I said as I walked into the living room.


“Why? I told you I’d be here.”


“Yeah, but I never once asked you to.” I gestured to the air as well. “This isn’t dry ice; it’s a bad air quality. I haven’t slept here in over a week.” Joey stepped towards me,


“Does it look like I give a shit about air quality? I’ll be fine, unlike somebody.” He turned away and began walking around the couch, towards the kitchen. “You really just abandoned your house because the air was a little cloudy? No wonder you couldn’t handle this mouse problem.” He crouched and looked under my old wooden cabinet. “I’m honestly surprised that girl hasn’t left yet.” He said under his breath, probably thinking I couldn’t hear. As got back up, he shot me acheeky smile and entered the kitchen.  


My rage surged, but before I could act, I was knocked in the head and thrown to the ground. As I slowly clambered to my feet, with my head in agony, I could hear muffled screams along with the sound of something ripping and scraping. I regained my blurred vision and felt that my hunting knife was no longer in my pocket. It was somewhere else. It was sunken into the back of a gurgling, writing Joey thrown onto his stomach. 


When I walked closer, the man’s movements slowed until they stopped and never started again. On the ground surrounding his body, deep scratch marks were put into the hardwood, marking the next victim of this creature. There were bite marks all down the arms of my neighbor as well as many across his bulging neck. He laid so disturbingly still yet at the same time I’d never found him so agreeable.


I frantically searched around the body for the thing, but I couldn’t find it until I switched on my flashlight and found the sickly being hunched over on my kitchen counter, it’s mouths twitching and stretching in fear. Not moving my light from it, I pulled my buzz saw out of my duffle bag and started it up. With the sound of its ringing, the thing screeched in my voice and began crawling across the counter. I sprinted over to it and began slicing through the foggy air with the saw in one hand as I kept the flashlight trained on it with the other. The creature managed to evade my attacks and threw a few scratches from its nails my way. 


With every movement it made, it scratched up my wooden countertops even more, and it continued to scar the wood as it crawled onto the floor and stomped through the living room. The thing reached the foyer and was stopped when the fog did. The front door laid just a few feet from it’s disgusting grasp. “NO!” it’s mouths yelled in my voice. The creature turned around and saw as I put myself in the door frame to the living room; it was trapped. The fog hadn’t yet traveled to the foot of the stairs. It’s red eyes flared and in an instant, it disappeared. Fog quickly filled with space it had left open. I heard a clambering above, and as my eyes turned to the top of the stairs, I found the creature staring back down at me with those same sharp eyes. It got down on its legs and skittered down the hallway, marking up the floor as it did so.


I kept looking to the stairs in disbelief, it appeared the thing could teleport within the fog. My mind eventually regained the ability to think, and I commenced my plan. Digging in my bag, I found the trap I’d created in my shop and made the proper preparations with my buzz saw for its placement.


As I finished the job, I heard a knock at the door, and upon looking through the glass, found Eileen, her eyes piercing through the glass. I opened the door, and so as to not let her in, I exited it instantly and closed it behind me. I made sure my back was directly in front of the glass so she couldn’t see inside. “What do you want?” I asked.


“I wanna know what the hell is going on with you, and don’t say that nothings going on because I know there is.” She threw her arms up in frustration. “I know you wanted space and everything, but I think you really don’t.”
“Ok.” I responded, unsure of what to say. All I knew was that I needed to get her out of there for her own safety.


“Really?” Eileen said. “I just want to help you, why can’t you see that?” She pointed to the door. “Here’s something that’s up, why won’t you let me into you’re house? You always make up some excuse. Can we just talk in there, it’s dark out here.”


“No.”


“Why not?” I put my face closer to hers,


“You can’t see my house. No one should ever see my house ever again. I don’t want to see you, I told you that, but you don’t listen as usual. Get the fuck out of my life and let me deal with my shit. I don’t need anyone knowing about it.” Tears began streaming down her face, and after a brief look into my cold eyes, Eileen turned around, got in her car, and drove off. It was hard, but it needed to happen; she needed to be safe.


Reentering my house, stepping over the door mat, I saw that the fog was nowless than a foot away from my door. I walked up the stairs, flashlight and hammer in hand, to get things started. The door to the storage space was wide open, and as I walked across the scarred floor, which had even gone through my new carpet, I saw the creature run out of the box labeled “DVD’s” and furiously stomp down the hallway, into the guest bedroom. My limited sight made me cautious to move forward, but I had to; I couldn’t let the thing know my plan, so I played along with it. “Come out! This is it! I’m gonna smash you and put an end to this!” I ran into the bedroom and saw the vague shape of the creature on the floor, prompting me to slam my hammer down, but I missed, creating a hole in the wood.


“STOP!” My voice shouted in that same disgusting choir. It speedily crawled across the room, knocking over any pictures or lamps I had upon the bedside tables. The fog made me think very careful about my movements, as it knew how to move through it better than I did. I advanced steadily and managed to trap it in a corner, but before my hammer could go into one of its mouths, the thing disappeared again.


I realized it had gone downstairs. My decent led me to just barely see the figure of mouthed creature walk on its hind legs through the living room doorway. Upon it’s seeing me, it got down on all of its legs and retreated back towards the kitchen. I raced down the stairs, dashed through the thickly covered foyer and living room, leaving me just enough time to jump over the couch and cut off the thing. I spotted one of the mouths sprout a pained grin as the creature turned around and headed for the foyer. I followed and watched as it reached for the door, it’s mouths giving out variations of the word, “OUT!”


It's triumphant moment of breaking the glass of the front door was cut short as it dropped through the doormat and into my trap. The trap was something I would compare to the ones the Viet Kong used in the 70’s; a disguised drop into a pit of spikes. Mine was more advanced however, the spikes on the bottom cause the two walls of spikes beside it to clamp together; nothing would get out of it.
As the thing hit the bottom spikes, the walls soon followed, but before they could clamp onto the creature, it reached up, gripping the hardwood above with its claws, managing to pry itself up as a reddish-purple substance spewed out of it’s wounds. It couldn’t move any of its limbs except the ones closest to its thrashing neck.


I grabbed the head, seeing the terror in its eyes. It filled me with so much joy seeing my former emotions put onto what had caused them. I grabbed the buzzsaw from my nearby duffel bag and started it up. The mouths upon it’s body when into a frenzy, yelling out in my own horrified voice, “PLEASE! HELP! OUT! NO! EILEEN!” Hearing it say her name put me into my own frenzy, bringing my saw to the creature’s neck. As I did so, I whispered so close my breath stung it’s eyes,


“Shut up. You’re never leaving this place. No one will ever hear your pathetic begging.” I slowly cut through until the job was finished. That’s when the mouths finally stopped.
I let out a large sigh, setting the saw down, and laying upon on my tired back in pure exhaustion. Taking an observation of shut off glass chandelier, I saw as the fog began to disperse. It didn’t go anywhere, it simply stopped existing. Places I could hardly see previous were completely visible, and that then meant I could now perfectly see the desolation my house had been brought to. The reddish-purple substance from the creature had spewed across the foyer yet had surprisingly not gotten on my clothes at all. I could see Joey’s blood still running through the living room as well as the countless scratches upon the floors, furniture, and walls.


My duffel bag was still open, and at the bottom, I saw the bright red container of gasoline I planned on using on the creature stuck in the trap. There was no saving this house, and even if I was to have repaired all the damages, I could never have felt comfortable living there again. There was also another body I had to take care of, and maybe if the world thought that that was me, I could be ok with it. I rose from my spot on the floor, walked over Joey’s body, turned on the gas stove, and returned to the duffle bag. 

The main area I poured the gasoline over was the creatures body as well as Joey’s; no one needed to know what happened here. Before leaving, I took the knife out of Joey’s back and put it back in my duffel bag. With nothing else to do, I opened the front door, lit up a match, threw it onto the creatures decapitated corpse, and let the fire do the rest.


Now that I’ve finally recorded my experience, I now feel worse than ever. I’ve learned nothing from any of this. It seemed like my triumph over that thing was pretty final; what am I still missing? I thought that once I buried Russell’s body in the woods, I could have put this whole thing behind me. The fire at my old house is said to be an accident. They’re saying the body found there unidentifiable, and they didn’t say a word about the corpse of a monster, so it appears my plan worked. I’m just glad they aren’t saying it was a suicide.


I’ve wasted too much time writing this. The whole reason I decided to do this was because I found in the closest of this tiny little apartment I own, a little patch of fog. I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me again, but as I closed the door, I heard a loud bang from inside. So much fog has poured in over the course of writing and it’s going so much faster than it did before. The fog’s nearly to the front door, and I’ve heard my voice whispering through the keyhole ever since I started writing. Why is this thing still alive? What did I do wrong? I did everything I was supposed to.
