I work for a very special renovation company. 


If we get it wrong, your reno is free and half the crew dies.


I didn't know that when Theseus Construction hired me as a labourer. 


The boss, an old guy with wrinkly face tattoos, took one look at me and offered me the job. 


"Delos," he said. I guess I looked confused. "My name is Delos."


I'm not particularly big or strong or handy. Turns out that wasn’t why he hired me. He just needed more bodies.


I quit my cashier job on the spot. It sucked, and the construction job paid more and offered benefits.


The following morning, I was in the back of a van holding the broken pieces of my dad's old work boot laces; they crumbled when I tried to re-tie them. 


A nice guy, Tyler, had an extra pair. "Kind of like what we do on houses," he said. I smiled and thanked him and didn't point out that I had no clue what he meant.


We arrived at the house and Delos was already there. He didn't wait for us to get out of the van and went and knocked on the front door of an older looking house. It was made of orange brick and had at least three floors above the ground. A rusty staircase clung to the side like a soon forgotten thought for safety.


Six workers, including Tyler and me, got out of the van and waited in the driveway. The other guys stared at Delos. It was weird that we were just standing around. Shouldn't we save time and get our tools and equipment ready? Or at least talk about the project? 


Another van showed up full of workers. A dozen people for a single house. A big job, I figured.


The front door opened a little, but nobody was there in the narrow, dark space.


"Shit," Tyler swore, "it didn't work."


"It takes time," the old man said.


"It's been three years," Tyler said, despairing, I thought. "How many more people have to-"


Delos glared at him; Tyler shut his mouth and stood a little straighter. 


"We always get it right eventually. Someone has to. There's no one else." We watched as he opened a case of precisely rolled cigarettes and smoked. He backed out onto the lawn and scratched his eyebrow with his pinky, bringing the flaming end of the cigarette dangerously close to his eye.


Delos exhaled and ground the unfinished smoke under his boot. "Okay, try the basement. Cold cellar."


"I told you," Tyler said under his breath as he pushed open the door fully on a main floor stripped to the lattice. The rest of the crew came in and looked as confused as I felt. Three years on this?


Instructions were minimal. Tyler told me and the others to follow him. 


Delos had remained outside. "Take out the bottom shelf and-"


"Replace it," Tyler finished for him. "Not my first day, for Christ sake."


I hung back and watched Delos fish a weird stick from his pocket, a small dowsing rod. Superstitious farmers thought they were magic and could be used to find the ideal spot to dig a well.


"What’s that for?" I asked anyway.


"Your mom," Delos snapped. "Now get your ass downstairs."


We all went. The basement was the opposite of the main floor, finished and pristine. Evidence of people living there recently was on a coffee table; a hockey game played on the TV. Tyler picked up the remote and turned it off. 


I guess he saw my expression; it was weird to assume the homeowner was done watching the game.


"We can't afford distractions," he explained.


Moldy, orange soup had been left to rot on the coffee table. Gross. I bent to pick it up, intending to bin it.


"Don’t touch that," Tyler said. "Don’t touch anything," he told us all. 


"What do you mean?" a big guy asked. "What are we doing here?"


Tyler got right in the guy's face, though he must have weighed a hundred less and only came up to his chest. "Shut up. Do as you're told. Get paid. That a problem?" The big guy smirked but didn't say that it was.


The crowd of us watched Tyler open the door on a cold cellar where old but perfectly intact shelves lined the walls.


I stepped into the threshold to look.


Tyler walked the length of the room, which ran under the front porch of the house. An open grate near the ceiling let in the winter air. He checked his phone, swiping furiously, and then stared at the screen.


"Closed," he said to himself before sliding the grate shut. Next, he went to an empty shelf in the bottom row and popped it out. 


"Here," he said, passing the plank to me. "Take it upstairs and outside."


"Okay," I said. He watched. They all did as I went to the stairs and up them. Delos had gone back to the lawn with his dowsing rod and for another cigarette. 


"Drop it," he ordered.


"Drop it?"


"On the grass," he growled. Then he crouched and ran the miniature dowsing rod over the plank. "Fuck."


"What?"


He stood up. "Wrong fucking shelf. Take it back."


I didn't move because I didn't understand. "What is-"


"Just take it back!" He turned his back on me and touched his cheek with the back of his hand. When he sniffled, I knew Delos was crying.


It's sad that I didn't know how to comfort a crying man and only wanted to get away. Better to ignore a fracture in the masculine facade. It felt respectful to do so. 


This job was fucking weird. I could have quit and walked away. Instead, I took the shelf back to the basement.


The game was on the TV again. 


The door to the cold cellar was closed.


"Tyler?"


He opened the door enough to slide out and closed it behind him. "Wrong shelf, huh?"


"What’s going on?"  I looked past his shoulder. 


"Nothing." He took the shelf and curiously slid it into the cold cellar, careful again to not let me see anything.


"Where are the others?"


He smiled.


"Tyler?"


"Let’s go." He tried to gently guide me toward the stairs.


I shrugged him off. "Don’t touch me." I pushed him back and went for the door.


"Don’t!"


If I'd let him take me out of that house, I wouldn't see them when I try to sleep. 


All were dead. Bodies ripped apart and blood and organs leaked onto the concrete and were pasted to the walls. Under the grate, a hunched shadow turned. Its glowing red eyes created confusing light trails with the motion. 


It stood up, a translucent woman's silhouette, paradoxically still as if cast by a material body, little more than a refusal to let light travel in peace.


Absurdly, I apologised. "Sorry. I didn't mean…" 


"Why did you do that?" she asked with a voice unaffected by the circumstances or the lack of a visible mouth. "Why did you do it?!"


"I'm sorry-"


The shadow and its trailing eyes shifted to the ceiling. Footprints in the gore appeared as the thing came closer. 


I yelped and turned to run but the door slammed shut. 


"Tyler!" I called, trying the handle first, which wouldn't budge. Those eyes slid overhead, casting the scene in red. "Tyler! Please!"


I fell to my knees. Blood poured from a cut so fine across my forehead, I barely felt it. Another light impact touched the side of my neck. I crumpled to the floor. 


This wasn't possible. It had to be a dream or some kind of crazy hallucination. I struggled on the wet concrete to move until the tip of my fingers brushed the edge of the shelf I'd taken outside.


Another gash appeared on my forearms. Invisible claws gripped and tore while the shadow seemed to observe. 


Half unconscious and blind, I held the musty wood plank over my face, a pitiful shield against a nightmare. The attack relented and a quiet filled the cellar so fully I held my breath. 


When I peeked, the eyes were there on the ceiling and the shadow too. It waited for what I would do next. The wrong choice of action would mean death. I knew that without understanding how. Some deeply buried instinct whispered faint instructions to my overwhelmed brain.


I rolled over a little and put the shelf back where Tyler had removed it, resting the plank on nailed blocks of wood, warped with age but used to carrying the familiar load.


The red glow vanished. I stood up and had to skate across the guts painted concrete. To lift a shaking foot and place it forward and repeat the motion wasn't possible. I felt rigid and jiggly at the same time. I trembled and left the cellar.


Tyler had left. The TV played the hockey game; it was the same moment I'd seen twice before. Steam rose from the soup on the coffee table.


Delos tackled me as I tried to flee out the front door. I started shrieking, the sound alien and distant like someone else was losing their shit on the lawn.


"Nobody opened the door did they? Nobody opened the door!"  I wondered who was ranting until I realised it was me; the front door had opened on its own when we first got to the house. It hadn’t seemed odd then because we all assumed the owner, a real live person, was on the other side.


Delos knew though. So did Tyler. They argued in the van about the shelf. Each blamed the other for the massacre. I listened from the back, wrapped in a tarp.


"In all my years running this crew," Delos said, "never lost so many, so fast."


Tyler took us far down Patriot's Lane to the outskirts of Bridal Veil Lake. He pulled into the parking lot of a closed down strip joint advertising free hotdogs to patrons. 


"You should have been more specific about the shelf," Tyler said. 


"Didn't think I needed to be." The old man rolled down his window and spat. "Now we got to start again." He sighed as if that were the worst thing that had happened today.


"We still got him," Tyler said, meaning me. "I'm here. Better off than last time." In a rare and unfamiliar display of affection, he gripped Delos' shoulder. "As long as one of us is left…"


"It's the same crew." 


Then they each grinned, and I felt it prudent to intervene. "What the fuck is going on?!"


I found out. They told me. Maybe you understand by this point too, which means you're definitely smarter than I am and should come and work for Delos.


Hell, you should come even if you don't get it. We need the bodies. Safety in numbers.


But just so you're not completely blindsided, I'll make it clear the same way Tyler did for me: "We renovate the homes of angry spirits. Slowly. Go too fast, or move the wrong thing, and you get the carnage like today."


Why not just blow up the whole house and call it a day? I asked something like this but with more expletives.


"Too fast. Traumatises the already angry spirit. Now you got a full blown curse roaming the streets. Slow. You gotta go slow. Replace pieces of the home, until it's not the same place anymore. Trauma's associated with a specific location. Change the location, calm the mind. Angry spirit chills, hopefully moves on, or at least doesn't kill anymore."


"Then get paid," Delos added. 


"Have fun," I said and went for the door. The locks shut.


"It's not that simple," Tyler said. He shrugged and smiled.


Delos chuckled and coughed into his fist. "You're part of the crew now, boy. You're a part of that house."


So I can't leave until it's finished.


The pay is great. So are the benefits. Job security is guaranteed so long as you're alive. 


Tyler died at another site, changing out a chandelier, two weeks later. Another crew wiped a couple days after that. 


Then it was me driving the van and trying to comfort Delos.


I tell him not to worry. We'll get it right next time. Maybe. Sometime for sure.


He hands me a paycheque. He still prints them out. 


"What’s the stick for?"


"Nothing. Just had it a long time."


The sole survivor of the most recent slaughter leaps out of the van unexpectedly, and drops dead. Angry spirits grow attached fast. They kill what they can't keep.


"How come nobody remembers all the dead people?" I ask Delos.


He exhales plumes of smoke from his nostrils, an old dragon who's seen it all and become tired. 


"Because they weren't a part of anything when they died." 


"Oh."


I drive him home, and we get blackout drunk before we can think about trying again tomorrow.
