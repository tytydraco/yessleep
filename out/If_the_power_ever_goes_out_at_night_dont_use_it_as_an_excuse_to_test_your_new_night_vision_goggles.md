I think the relationship between eBay and certain drinks is well known at this point, it's usually days after the night you popped the lid that you get the box containing whatever thing you bought, that at the time soundest the best idea ever.

&#x200B;

That was me on the night i realized my alcohol tolerence was far lower then i thought it was, i didn't even plan to go on ebay, i drunkenly clicked the link.

&#x200B;

At first i looked at cars and stuff, then started going into all the catagories, i landed on one for military surplus and collectibles, and found myself scrolling through all the uniforms and stuff that i could have owned.

&#x200B;

I remember seeing the auction for the night vision goggles, it looked amateur, usually it's surplus companies that deal with this stuff all the time, it looked like a smartphone shot of something like a PVS-7, the seller was called 'Cam0flage' and had decent reviews, i don't remember much but i do remember checking his other auctions and finding out that he mainly sold battledress and stuff.

&#x200B;

What i could read of the description was pretty vague

&#x200B;

'Selling these goggles, don't know much about these, think they are Gen2 PVS-7, they come from a friend of a friend who was in the US Army, sold as is, untested'

&#x200B;

Now if i was sober i'd be googling about what i'd be getting myself into, what a PVS-7 is, what generations are, but the auction was going for £100 and due to end the next day, i put in £20 and promptly forgot.

&#x200B;

Cue my surprise the next day, at work, i receive an email congratulating me on winning an auction, i tap it and the memories come flooding back, sober me thought about telling the seller what actually happened, but i paid, i was fairly sure they're worth more then that even broken and even then, they'd look cool as a display piece.

&#x200B;

A week later and i was unpacking this new toy, it was in a dark green pelican type case, heavily used with scuff marks, opening to reveal a well used pair of night vision goggles.

&#x200B;

Just like the case they were scuffed and heavily worn, both the eyepiece and lens were capped and i quickly realized why the seller couldn't test it, two wires hung from the goggles, ripped off, they were obviously meant to run to a power supply, but in the bottom of the case was an equally tattered army field manual, reading it, i learned all these goggles needed was just a standard battery.

&#x200B;

So i kept them around and took them to a friends house on the weekend, a friend whose into electronics and stuff, and he obliged to solder a new battery holder as well as test them out, i called round just after nightfall and plopped the goggles on his bench.

&#x200B;

'Thats easy' he said

&#x200B;

We even did a quick test by hooking them up to a power supply, even with the cap on, a faint green glow came out of the eyepiece.

&#x200B;

We got a battery holder on and securely attached to the headstrap, then we left to test them.

&#x200B;

We decided on a cemetary, because they tend to be pretty dark at night and who knows, we could maybe.. see a ghost.

&#x200B;

We got there and finally uncapped the goggles, flipping a coin to see who will try them first, i did, much to my friends annoyance.

&#x200B;

I put the goggles over my head and suddenly everything came clear, a strange sort of clear, and everything was as smooth as real life, it was strange to say the least, stars glowed above and an airplane looked almost like a torch shining directly toward you.

&#x200B;

An annoying black spot persisted in the middle of the goggles view, i learned this is because they'd been exposed to a bright light at some point and there's nothing you can do to fix it.

&#x200B;

Still though, it was like daytime, my friend was equally blown away, we took turns using them to stargaze, as much as we could in the town, and just looking around.

&#x200B;

I took the goggles home and put them away, thinking one day maybe they'll come in useful and what a lucky find they were.

&#x200B;

That day came pretty soon, a month after testing the goggles, in the dead of night, the lights dimmed and struggled, something at a substation somewhere fought for the free movement of electrons for a good ten minutes, but the fault won, the whole neighbourhood was plunged into darkness.

&#x200B;

The darkness reminded me of my night vision goggles, so i reached under my desk and retrieved the case, quickly equipping the goggles and removing the cap, i reinserted the battery and the world became bright again, at least to me, and save for that one spot in the middle of the view.

&#x200B;

I walked outside, the whole neighbourhood was out, all the visual snow in the goggles tricked me into thinking that it was snowing for a second, i looked both ways down the empty road before reporting it to the electric company, who said they're on the case and that a van should be here by several hours.

&#x200B;

Walking around the dead neighbourhood felt like playing splinter cell, it didn't take me long to find the problem either, a transformer on the electricity pole was burned to oblivion, i made a mental note of the poles unique number to tell the electricity people when they got here.

&#x200B;

I decided to spend the next few hours just walking around the neighbourhood, it was dead, no cars on the road and not another living being, unless you count the moths, who were actually navigating correctly for once.

&#x200B;

As i walked around things just seemed too, dead, not a light burned, not even a battery powered light, it had been an hour at this point, and there still was no cars, no sign of the electric company, the only sign of life was a luminous cloud that loomed in the sky, light pollution from a nearby town stretching it's way across the sky.

&#x200B;

I took the goggles off to get some cool pictures with my phone but something felt wrong, it seemed almost impossibly dark without the goggles, even when my eyes adjusted, i took some pictures, then put them back on and continued walking around.

&#x200B;

Hours went by and still no cars let alone the electric company van, i pulled out my phone only to discover no service, back at my house it could only get a glimmer of signal i could use to call the electric company, who said they were on their way and should be here in half an hour.

&#x200B;

I decided to venture out one last time, i reached the end of the block, there was a cul-de-sac from which the woods peaked out from between houses, cars sat around, and a bright halo of light moved across the sky, an airplane, above that sat the stars, and even faint glimmers off satalites.

&#x200B;

I looked back down, there, in the middle of the street under an electricity pole stood this.. thing, a humanoid figure, only a few feet tall, it had no features, it seemed to be composed entirely of static, i took the goggles off and shined my phone light in the direction, there was nothing.

&#x200B;

I put the goggles back on, now there was at least 5 of these things around, one seemed to absorb into a car, just after it did so, the cars alarm went off.

&#x200B;

I ran down the block, i needed to get away from these things, what were they? but no matter where i ran, i couldn't get away from them, they stood on corners, near cars, beneath lamp posts, and even though they were featureless, it felt like i had eyes on me, as i ran i suddenly encountered a wall of them, blocking the street.

&#x200B;

That's when words formed in thin air, they seemed to made out of the static from the night vision goggles, the same static the things were made of.

&#x200B;

'Don't worry' it said 'you can talk to us, we won't hurt you'

&#x200B;

I asked them what was going on, what they were, it was at this point i noticed one sat beneath the blown transformer.

&#x200B;

'We're gremlins' flashed across my vision

'We feed on magic smoke, and we want to let the smoke out of those goggles' 

&#x200B;

No way, i said to them, they'd just taken out the power to the neighbourhood, why do they want to break my NVGs next? 

&#x200B;

They inched closer, i was now encircled by the gremlins, one seemed to show me their powers by flying into the sky, a light went out on an airplane.

&#x200B;

I contemplated my actions, should i take the goggles off and run? it didn't matter, these things exist even if you can't see them, one of them stepped closer yet again, the night vision became dim and staticy.

&#x200B;

Suddenly they all took off running down the road, the goggles went back to normal as they did so, i turned around, an electric company van sat on the street corner, two linemen looked at the transformer.

&#x200B;

I spoke to them, showed them my night vision, which they thought were cool, they said the problem was due to a water intrusion, they setup some temporary equipment while they replaced the transformer.

&#x200B;

Little did they know i had met who ccccaaussed it whhy is myyy keybboard dooing thisss? itss thhose ggremlllinnns aggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
