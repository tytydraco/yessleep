Everything was blurring together as I awoke in the darkness of that house, and I could feel something shifting. The realization that Cabman wasn’t just dragging me through these horrifying events of his past for his own amusement. He wanted me to see. To feel. To understand. Each memory, every visceral moment, was a piece of a larger puzzle, designed to prepare me for this specific memory. The suffocating weight of his will pressed down harder than it had before. This wasn’t random. The memories, the pain, they were a message. A twisted foreshadowing of something far worse.

I could hear the faint sound of creaking floorboards upstairs again, bringing me back to the grim reality of my situation. For a moment, it felt like I was in control of my actions as I ascended the staircase. It was almost as if my mind was separating itself from Cabman's influence. I knew he was puppeteering me, but I could feel a sense of my autonomy returning. Each step felt heavier; my breath shallow as I neared the second floor. From the hallway, I could hear a voice and see flickering lights coming from one of the rooms. It was a man’s voice—clear, authoritative, and delivered with a deliberate cadence. I approached the partially open doorway, peering inside. The flickering lights came from a TV, casting a soft glow that illuminated the otherwise dark room. A close-up of a news reporter’s somber face filled the screen.

“A police report was filed against a local cab driver by a woman claiming she escaped a violent assault,” the reporter asserted, his voice steady, avoiding dramatic fluctuations. “The victim, bloodied and bruised, alleged the cab driver attempted to kill her.”

A grainy photo of a man wearing a dirty flat cap and a tattered peacoat, the same clothes I had grown so accustomed to seeing on Cabman, appeared on the screen. My chest tightened as the name appeared beneath the image: Walter Culver. The reporter continued, “In a statement, Walter has denied all allegations, claiming the accusations were fueled by the town’s bias against him.”

The creaking of floorboards returned, drawing my attention away from the TV. This time, I could make out the distinct sound of footsteps producing the noise, each step quietly echoed from down the hallway. I could feel Cabman urging me to follow the sound. I felt as though we had become symbiotically connected. While it seemed I could now make some decisions for myself, Cabman still had the final say over my actions.

Stepping out of the TV room, the hallway seemed so dark that my eyes struggled to adjust. I pressed my hand against the wall to ensure I could find my way, realizing I was still carrying the crowbar in my other hand. The creaking had stopped, but I knew I was close to where it had been coming from. I found the edge of a doorway to my right, and I cautiously felt my way inside.

I could hear the sound of labored breathing beneath me, heavy and distressed. My pulse quickened as my eyes began to focus, taking in my surroundings. It was a small bathroom with narrow walls and cracked tiles. My attention shifted to a huddled figure near the sink. As I looked closer, I realized it was a woman. One hand gripped the counter for support, her face a mix of pain and defiance. It took me a moment to recognize her but it was the woman from the cab, the one Cabman had attacked before. Her eyes widened as she locked onto me.

Cabman’s voice echoed in my head, his rage bubbling to the surface. "She didn’t really think she could hide from me, did she?"

The woman’s voice trembled with anger as it cut through the darkness, "I knew you were following me!" She pointed an accusing finger. "I knew you were stalking me.”

Cabman growled, his frustration spilling out of my mouth like poison. "This could’ve been avoided if you’d just cooperated. All I wanted was your valuables, just that ring. You made this messy, not me."

“Messy?" she retorted, her disdain cutting through the darkness like a knife. "What’s messier than manipulating my son into giving you information about me!?" Her voice cracked with hatred. “Did you really think I wouldn’t recognize your screen name? CABMAN!”

My stomach twisted, sickened by what I was hearing, but Cabman only laughed, his malevolence overtaking my unease. "Smart kid, but not smart enough to keep his big mouth shut," I found myself saying, still unable to control my words.

"You’re disgusting!" she spat, her eyes welling up with tears. "Talking to a child online through a video game to get to me? Do you even know what it’s like to see your child terrified every time he logs in? To hear him cry because some ‘nice guy’ online turned out to be a monster? You’re a coward… a predator who preys on children to do your dirty work." She pulled herself up from the floor and started toward the door.

I stepped in front of her, blocking her path with the crowbar. “Move,” she demanded, her voice weak but fierce.

I couldn’t. As much as I wanted to step aside, I was trapped under Cabman’s control. “You should’ve just let me take what I wanted. Now it’s time to face your punishment."

She shoved me aside, desperately slamming her shoulder into my chest with all of her weight. I stumbled sideways, dropping the crowbar and falling into the sink as my arm struck the mirror above it. The glass shattered on impact, sending shards raining onto the counter and floor.

My hand shot forward, grabbing her arm as she reached for the door. I yanked her back with excessive force, throwing her to the floor. She landed hard, clutching her stomach protectively as she tried to catch her breath. That’s when I saw it… her swollen belly. My overwhelming shock battled against Cabman’s mounting hatred. "You’re pregnant," he scowled, his voice thick with malice. "Another life for me to ruin for the sins of the mother!"

In an act of defiant rage, she grabbed a shard of broken glass from the mirror and swung it toward my throat. “You’re a disgusting pig!” she screamed, putting all her might into the attack. My body jerked backward just in time, the shard narrowly missing my carotid artery but slicing deep into my shoulder instead. Pain shot through me; a sharp, searing pain that, for the first time, felt like my pain… not Cabman’s.

She held the shard tightly, breathing hard as she glared at me. “Stay away from me and my family!” she screamed. “You won’t go anywhere near my daughter!”

"Your daughter?" I scoffed, feeling Cabman’s twisted excitement as a cruel grin was forced across my lips. "You’ll wish she was never born by the time I’m done with you both."

Cabman’s desires clouded my mind, consumed by greed, malice, and an unnatural yearning to see her suffer. He was filled with embarrassment and rage; the feeling of humiliation she caused fueled his pursuit of revenge. Nothing would stop him until she felt the same shame he believed she had inflicted on him, until she felt his pain, until her life was destroyed the way he thought she had tried to destroy his.

My heart broke for this woman. I could sense her deep hatred for Cabman, but it couldn’t rival the relentless hatred he held for her. She didn’t deserve this kind of treatment, but she was being forced to fight for her life and the life of her family against an unrelenting monster. I wanted desperately to stop Cabman, to end this nightmare, but I was powerless until this memory played out.

Downstairs, heavy footsteps could be heard thundering through the open front door, making their way up the stairs. “Police! The house is surrounded!” a voice shouted, growing louder with each step. I could feel Cabman’s shock… he hadn’t expected this. As the light faded from my eyes, the woman’s demeanor changed, a fleeting sense of hope manifested across her face.

Cabman’s rage burned, and as his anger grew, the whispered, chastising voices from before began to swirl inside my head. They were the same voices I had heard in the game. I still couldn’t make out what they were saying, but the sheer number of them all speaking at once was overwhelming, making it harder to focus on what was happening. They were angry, chaotic, and impossible to comprehend. Feeling dizzy and disoriented, my thoughts becoming fragmented and isolating.

Then the light from the officers’ flashlights began to bounce off the peeling wallpaper in the hallway, growing larger and brighter with every step they took closer to the bathroom. My body leapt forward without my control, Cabman sent me charging headlong toward the window, forcing me to hurl myself through it. Shards of broken glass tore into my legs and hands as I collapsed onto the fire escape.

I staggered to my feet, blood dripping from my palms, while shouts and pounding footsteps closed in behind me. Without a second thought, my body turned toward the metal stairs, every movement dictated by Cabman’s desperate need to escape.

Behind me, I heard the cops clamoring around the woman, followed by a sharp clicking noise. I never deviated from my path, sprinting down the first flight of steps. Pain shot through my shoulder with each step. The blood loss made it harder to maintain my balance, but I forced myself to keep moving.

Just as I turned the corner to the second set of steps, an ear-splitting shot rang out. The hot, piercing sting of steel burrowing itself into my left forearm. I faltered, my body dropping onto the grated staircase. I tried to shield my face as I fell, realizing that for that brief moment, the shock of the bullet piercing my arm had given me back control to my body.

I had never experienced pain this before, the sting of the bullet burned through muscle and bone. My vision became clouded, and I could barely process the agony before a heavy weight dropped on top me.

"Stay down!" The officer's voice was loud, controlled, but I could hear the strain in it. He pressed his knee into my back, forcing my cheek against the cold metal of the fire escape.

Cabman wouldn’t let me stop. Even as the officer pinned me down, his rage still pulsed through me like an unrelenting force, refusing to surrender. My hearing was muffled, but I could make out the crackle of the officer’s radio.

“Suspect is on the fire escape. Shots fired…”

Before he could finish his sentence, I jerked my body as hard as I could. The officer swayed precariously but maintained his grip, feeling his gun burrowing into my back. My arm was throbbing, but adrenaline overpowered the pain. I had to get free.

The radio crackled again.

"Dispatch to all units: The victim has been identified as 35-year-old Abigail Davis. Abigail is being transported by EMT. She's going into labor. Repeat, Abigail Davis is in labor. The baby is stable for now, but the mother is in distress."

Davis…

The name hit me like a sledgehammer to the chest, my pulse quickening. I know that name. Davis. Abigail meant nothing to me—but Davis was Zoey’s last name.

The officer loosened his grip slightly to respond to his radio.

“Suspect in custody, requesting backup for transport.”

Cabman seized the opportunity. My leg kicked out instinctively, searching for an opening. I managed to trap one of the officer’s legs with mine, driving my knee into his side and pushing with all my strength to throw him off balance. Rain started to fall as the officer fell backward, losing his grip on me. His gun slipping from his grasp and sliding across the slick metal of the fire escape.

I watched in slow motion as it spun just out of reach. My heart pounded furiously… between beats, my good hand stretched desperately, fingers clawing for the gun. The officer struggled to regain his footing, but by the time he realized my intent, it was too late. My fingertips skimmed the cold, slick metal as I fumbled for a grip. My hand danced along the barrel, twisting frantically to turn the handle toward me.

The brief glimmer of control the officer had felt drained from him as he charged at me, his eyes widening in sudden panic. I saw the fear spread across his face. My own dread mirroring his, and pooling in my stomach as I fought against the reality of what I knew was coming.

His hands clamped down on the gun, yanking furiously to rip it from my grasp. I held on, my muscles aching as we wrestled back and forth. He bared his teeth, grunting through clenched jaw as he tried again to pry it away. I dug in, retreating just enough to create space, both of us breathing heavily. My fingers grazed the trigger, the sensation was so foreign to me. It felt wrong… unnatural.

The officer’s eyes narrowed, realizing the tables had turned. My anguish was too much to bear and I didn’t want to see what was about to unfold. The balance had shifted. He hesitated, but Cabman didn’t.

I pulled the trigger.

The gunshot cracked like the sound of thunder in the alley. The officer’s face twisted in shock and dismay as he staggered backward, his hand clutching his stomach. His legs buckled, as he collapsed onto the metal grating, the rain water slowly dripping down his motionless frame.

I scrambled to my feet, barely aware of the blood soaking through my sleeve or the way the officer groaned in pain behind me. My legs moved on their own, pushing forward, down the fire escape, across the pavement, toward the cab.
