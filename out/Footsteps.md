Hearing is a miraculous gift, thanks to it we can feel the sound of all of nature's wonders, like birds singing or a baby's laughter, or maybe even impeding danger.That's what my ears caught a couple of nights ago, but i am not grateful for it.

It is 4:55 A.M. and i am trapped in my bedroom with someone (or better something) that wants me dead trying to breach in. I want to give you a bit of context quickly: i am staying at my aunt's house for a few weeks to take care of the place because she just had surgery and needs to stay in the hospital for a long time.

This all started four nights ago,when i woke up at 2:30 A.M. to use the bathroom. My aunt's house has two floors, my bedroom was located on the top floor and the bathroom was on the ground one. While i was on the toilet i heard super fast footsteps run past the door, which was strange since I was the only person in the house. I decided to ignore this weird phenomenon and go back to bed. 

During the day i never thought of what had happened the night before,until the next night. This time i heard the footsteps while i was still in my room, they were bashing on the ground floor at an insane speed. "What the fuck?" I thought,while being terrified for my life. They randomly stopped,just like the first time,only this time they didnt come from the bathroom area,but from the kitchen. After that,they moved again, this time to the living room and then to the dining room,but they never came close to the second floor. 

Tonight was different. I heard them rush up the stairs and stop in front of my door. Two knocks came afterwards,accompanied by my aunt's voice: "Alex,let me in dear,the sink isn't working", said that creature,attempting to act like my aunt but failing miserably. It seemed like this creature could kind of imitate human speech but not in a realistic way. The voice was monotone and the way it pronounced words felt.... off. It knocked again, this time asking the same question but in a different tone, a demanding one.

 I stayed frozen in my spot,not daring to move or respond to whatever that shit behind my door was,even though it kept begging to be let in. Its words slowly became cries, brutal and animalistic cries that even the most mentally resilient would have found unbearable. Eventually it stopped and the footsteps started again,this time going downstairs. 

You might be thinking that thing should be gone by now right? Then why do i still feel its presence lurking behind that door? I am afraid of what will happen to me when i will eventually have to open it since if i don't i will starve to death.The only question i have right now is why was i its target, did it know i heard the footsteps every single night or did it just randomly decide to feast on me? I'll try to keep you updated if i survive.
