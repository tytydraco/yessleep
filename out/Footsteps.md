I (34M) live alone in a small 2nd-floor walk-up apartment in a quiet, older building in a suburb outside Montreal. Rent is cheap for the area, the neighbors mostly keep to themselves, and I've never had any issues until about mid-October last year.

It started with tiny things I dismissed at first:

Footsteps overhead at 3–4 a.m. almost every night. Not loud stomping, just careful shifting, like someone pacing slowly in socks. The unit above me is supposed to be occupied by a single older woman (Mme. Lefebvre) who I've only seen twice in three years. She uses a walker. No way she's up walking around at that hour.

A faint scratching sound in the ceiling above my kitchen, intermittent, like nails on drywall, maybe once or twice a week.

My kitchen pendant light (old cheap fixture) would sometimes dim for 2–3 seconds then brighten again. I replaced the bulb twice. Electrician came, said everything was fine, probably just old wiring in the building.

A smell. Not constant, but every so often, musty, like damp clothes and body odor mixed with something metallic. I'd open windows, run the fan, clean everything. It always came back.

I figured maybe Mme. Lefebvre had a cat I never knew about, or mice, or the guy below me was smoking weird stuff again. I complained to the super once. He knocked on her door, she said everything was normal, end of story.

Then in early December things escalated.

I woke up at 2:47 a.m. to the light in the kitchen flickering again, but this time it was rhythmic. On-off. On-off. Pause. On-off-on-off-on. Like Morse code, but I don't know Morse. I laid there frozen, listening. The footsteps were directly above the kitchen now, very slow, deliberate. Then silence for maybe 10 minutes. Then scratching again, louder, right above where the light is mounted.

I got up, grabbed my phone, stood under the light and recorded video. In the clip you can hear the scratching stop the second I stepped underneath. Dead silence. Then, maybe 8 seconds later, tap… tap-tap… tap. Three distinct knocks from inside the ceiling, directly above my head.

I noped out to my car and slept in it that night with the doors locked. Next day I called the non-emergency police line (514-280-2222). They sent an officer. He listened to my story, knocked on Mme. Lefebvre's door. She answered, seemed confused but polite. Officer asked if he could look around. She let him in. He came back down and told me:

Apartment is clean, normal.

No signs of anyone else living there.

She has a small dog now (explains occasional barking I never heard before?).

Ceiling above my unit is drop-ceiling in her place, old building quirk. He said sometimes rodents get in the space between floors.

I felt stupid. But the officer did say: "If it happens again, call us immediately. Don't confront anything yourself."

It got quiet for almost three weeks. I started to relax. Convinced myself I was paranoid, maybe hearing pipes or the building settling.

Then January 5th, around 1:20 a.m.

I was in bed scrolling on my phone when the kitchen light came on by itself.

I don't have smart bulbs. It's a basic switch on the wall.

I sat up. Heart hammering. The light stayed on maybe 15 seconds, then off. Then on again. Off. On for longer this time.

Then I heard it, very clearly, a man's low voice directly above me. Whispering. Not words I could make out at first, just murmuring. Angry murmuring. Then louder: "...told you... stay still..."

I grabbed my keys, phone, and ran barefoot to the stairwell. Called 911 from the lobby. While waiting for police I messaged the super and cc'd the landlord. They both showed up fast.

Cops arrived, banged on Mme. Lefebvre's door. No answer. They forced entry (landlord gave permission).

The apartment was empty.

No furniture except a mattress in the living room. No dog. No walker. Just trash bags, food wrappers, a sleeping bag, a bucket that smelled like urine and feces. And in the drop-ceiling tiles above my kitchen, one was pushed aside.

They found a roughly cut hole in the subfloor. Big enough for a person to lower themselves through if they were thin. Below it, in my ceiling space: a sleeping pad, several empty energy drink cans, a headlamp, a small battery bank, zip ties, duct tape, a hunting knife, and dozens of photos.

Photos of me. Sleeping. Showering (taken through the vent?). Eating. Working at my desk. Some printed, some on a cracked phone screen they also found.

The police believe the intruder had been accessing the apartment above mine for months, possibly since the old lady moved out quietly last summer and no one updated the lease properly. He probably entered through a shared attic hatch or fire escape, then lived in the ceiling cavity during the day and came down at night when I was asleep or out. The scratching was him widening the access hole over time. The footsteps were him moving around the joists to stay above me. The smell was him.

They think he watched me through the light fixture, there's now a small drilled hole next to the mounting bracket. The flickering? Him messing with the wires to see my reaction.

Worst part: one of the photos was timestamped December 24th. Christmas Eve. I was asleep on the couch after too much wine. In the picture I'm covered with a blanket, and there's a hand, his hand, visible in the frame, reaching down from the ceiling hole toward my face. Inches away. Like he was about to touch me but stopped.

They haven't caught him yet. Prints were in the system but no match. No DNA hit. Landlord is evicting the ghost tenant, sealing the ceiling, installing cameras. But I moved out two days ago. Staying with family.

Every time I close my eyes I see that photo. That hand. And I keep thinking: how many nights did he come all the way down? How many times did I wake up because he was standing there, and I just rolled over and went back to sleep?

I still check the ceiling lights in every room I'm in. I can't stop.

If you live in an old building with drop ceilings or shared attic access, check yours. Please.

Stay safe.
