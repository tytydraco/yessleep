I keep seeing things at night. Faces, usually. Or like some sort of silhouette in the corner. Relatable? I’m sure it is, because everyone’s mind plays those tricks. Pile of clothes on your chair? That shit turns into the hatman crouched by the end of your bed at 3am. But lately I'm seeing things that really aren’t there. I’ll see a figure in the corner of the room, but there’s no pile of clothes or hanging bag to explain why my brain convinced itself of this creature’s presence. I will see the outline of *something* in the dark, but as soon as I turn my lamp on, it is literally an empty corner.

Full disclosure, I’ve been known to have hallucinations now and then. I have a pretty mild form of bipolar, and when I’ve been under incredible stress as a teen, I’ve had these kind of dreams where I’m actually awake, but just barely. I used to occasionally see things or people in my bedroom, but it would never last long, and I'd always realise it wasn't real. I’m not sure if that meets the criteria for a hallucination or not, because it is in that half asleep state, but I guess it’s important context that I’ve been known to have a few issues with that kind of thing. You’re probably reading that and thinking ‘mystery solved, it’s just some sort of hallucination come nightmare’. That’s what I thought, too.

I started noticing it after my insomnia would flare up - it’s pretty typical for someone with bipolar to have sleep issues, so every now and then my body clock gets fucked over and I’m practically nocturnal. I work at a bar and my shifts vary from afternoon-evening and evening-night, so it’s not a huge issue for me as long as I manage to sleep a few hours in the morning. I tend to just lay in bed watching YouTube or Netflix, trying not to disturb my flatmates. I’ve had these sleep issues for years, and I’m not usually spooked out by the whole 3am ‘witching hour’ thing, but for some reason my skin started crawling at around 3am every night a few months ago. Not because I was aware of the time, to be honest the night becomes a blur of me attempting to sleep while keeping myself occupied with random video essays or shitty Netflix dramas, but after a few nights of this feeling, I realised it was happening at a similar time. You know that feeling when you’ve just watched a particularly disturbing psychological thriller, and you can’t shake the feeling it’s somehow real and you’re next, despite knowing full well that’s impossible? That’s how I’d describe the feeling. I knew - or at least believed - that it was a totally irrational feeling. But that didn’t make it go away. Usually I’d make sure I was watching something chilled out and funny to drown out the feelings, and eventually fall asleep.

That was until I started seeing things. It was just little shadows in my peripheral vision at first, easy to rationalise away as my mind playing tricks. The outline of a person, something moving in the corner - I think most people think they see things like that when it's late, you're tired, and have the creeps. I would just sense something off, get that feeling someone was watching, mistake a shadow for something more tangiable. It took some time before it became prominent enough for me to be actually concerned about it, but then it wasn’t just in my peripheries anymore. I could glance over and see something there, if only briefly. Sometimes it was just a black lump, similar to the shape of a person hunched up in a ball, sometimes I could swear that this thing had a face, just peeking out at me, watching. When I’d look away to grab my phone for the flashlight, or to turn my lamp on, it would be gone. Even before the light was turned on, I could tell it had vanished. Just looking away was enough to shake the 'hallucination', so eventually, whenever I'd see something, I'd force myself to look away for a few seconds, and it would be gone. I knew that the more you feed into a paranoia, the stronger it gets, so I tried my best to act like it was nothing. Because of my history with “kinda” hallucinations, I didn’t think it could’ve been real. I doubled down hard on my plan of just looking away and not giving this thing any attention, and I was sure it would just go away if I kept it up. Ghosts aren’t real.

The strange thing to me was that my life was going pretty well. As I said, the only time I had ever hallucinated was when I was under extreme stress, so I was pretty confused about the whole thing. I loved my job, I had made a lot of new friends, and I overall felt good about myself. So why was this happening now? I knew I should probably speak with a doctor, but honestly I thought once my sleep schedule got a bit more normal that things would clear up naturally. I’ve never enjoyed the times where my body clock gets stuck on nocturnal mode much, I never feel quite as rested even if I do get a full 8 hours, so I brushed it off as more of a sleep/tiredness issue than anything else. My nightly routine consisted of me trying my hardest to fall asleep before 3am, failing miserably, getting the chills, and avoiding looking at anything other than my laptop screen in front of me. It never quite worked, I’d often see a pale face in my periphery, just peering from the corner, but I refused to give it power. "It's all in your head", I'd repeat over and over to myself.

After a long shift at work one Friday night, I was incredibly tired, but knew my body probably wouldn’t let me sleep until 4/5am, so got stuck into a new Netflix series. I’d become so accustomed to the uncomfortable feeling that always struck me at around 3am that I nearly didn’t notice it beginning. But then it slowly got more noticeable. I couldn’t focus on the new series that I was actually enjoying, but I tried to tune back in. I kept telling myself that the less I focus on it, the less power these hallucinations have.

Then I saw it. 

In the corner of my room, the figure was just sat upright, staring straight at me. It looked like a person, but something told me it wasn't. I don't know if it was that its smile was too wide, or its eyes too dark and empty. I just knew it wasn’t. 

I looked at it. I looked away. I looked back. Still there.

It was so dark, my eyes could just about make out the figure, but I was certain it was there. Like I said before, there was nothing else there, just a blank wall. No furniture, no clothes, nothing that could be mistaken for a figure in the dark. This is when I really stated to doubt that this was just a figment of my imagination. My body froze, but my fingers scrambled to grab my phone to try and get a proper glimpse of this thing. I clicked on the flashlight icon and shone it to the corner of the room.

 There was nothing there.

 Clearly this was all in my head, there's just no way that thing was real. I knew something was wrong deep down, but I kept on blaming it on my bipolar and poor sleep. Sure, I’d never had anything like this happen to me other than the odd hallucination as a teenager, and sure this thing was sticking around longer and longer, but there’s just no way it’s anything but a hallucination. Despite trying to convince myself of this, I didn’t sleep that night. Not until the sun had risen.

I think the exhaustion of not sleeping properly mixed with the anxiety I felt for the rest of that day led me to be able to sleep a lot earlier that night, probably at around midnight, after a long shift at work. I slept with the light on, which I usually can't do as its too disruptive to me, but this time it was comforting. I slept for nearly 12 hours in a restless sleep, and woke up with adrenaline coursing through my veins. I often get nightmares that I can't really recall in the morning which have this effect on me, but with everything that had been happening it set me off on a bad tone. My room seemed a lot messier than I had remembered leaving it - clothes left across the floor, my art supplies scattered across my desk, glasses of water across the dresser. I guessed I must've been so tired I wasn't really aware of my own actions the night before, but it was odd. I had the day off, so I cleaned up and tried my best to relax for the rest of the day, knowing that stress would only make things worse. Throughout the rest of the day, I suffered with migraines and flashing lights in my vision. Everything felt wrong. 

That night, I started to doze off at around midnight again. As I looked at the time before I shut my eyes, I felt relieved. "This will be the end of those fucked up hallucinations, if I can just get my sleep schedule back to normal", I said to myself, knowing the creepy shit only seemed to happen at around 3am, and let myself fall asleep.

Then, I was woken up by something. Scratching, coming from the same corner I saw that fucking creature. I was almost rhythmic - four little fast scratches, a slight pause, and then a fast scratch followed by one long, loud scratch. Over, and over, and over. I felt terrified to open my eyes. I was sure I was awake, but I tried that technique they teach you about nightmares to try and lucid dream, try and imagine you are somewhere nice or you have a shotgun or something. It didn't work. I pinched myself to see if it hurt. It did. I was awake. I finally got the courage to look up at the corner of the room. Sat upright again, the figure had it's gaze fixed on me as it's wirey fingers played out their little melody. It's face was the same pale shade, with the same dark eyes, but this time it's smile was even more gaping and twisted. It’s teeth glimmered in the dark, they looked sharp and coated in a dark liquid. That fucking smile, it’s nothing I’ve ever seen before. It’s fingers looked pointed and rough as they more and more frantically scratched at my walls. I wanted to scream, to get my flatmates to come in and help me, but I didn't want them to think I was insane. What if it really was just my bipolar? What if I was in some sort of psychosis? They were decent people, but we hadn't known each other very long, and I wasn't comfortable sharing my mental health issues with them. I didn't want them to think I was insane. So, I bargained with myself that I would just turn the lamp on, and if it was still there, that was reasonable cause to shout to them for help. It wouldn't prove its not a hallucination, but it would probably mean I'm so far gone that I need serious help anyway.

So, trying not to look away this time in fear of it getting closer, I switched on my lamp. 

Gone. 

“What the actual fuck. I'm going fucking insane”, I cried to myself. I decided that first thing in the morning, I would arrange an appointment with my doctor and get some antipsychotics or some shit. But there was no way in hell I was sleeping that night, I didn't care that it was all in my head, that shit was way too scary for me to go through again. I went to go make some coffee, when I saw my flatmate in the kitchen, looking mildly infuriated and groggy whilst pouring a glass of water.

"Uh, hey Lexi", I said, wondering what she was doing up at 3:30am.

"Hey, what was all that scratching about in your room? Are you like... cleaning or something?".

My heart skipped a fucking beat. If she heard scratching too…

I ran back into my bedroom, I needed to see if there was any evidence to prove once and for all that this was not all in my head, that this fucking demon existed and wasn’t a product of my messed up brain chemistry. I looked at the corner of the room properly, with the main light turned on this time, and I could see scratch marks across the walls.

I haven't spoken to Lexi, or any of my flatmates. I haven't slept. I haven't turned the light off. But if I'm being totally honest, I don't think keeping the light on will prevent it from coming back. It already developed from a small glance in the corner of my eye, to a full figure I can stare at face to face - as if it was getting stronger and stronger, so I expect it will be strong enough to appear in the light soon. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've caught a few glimpses in my peripheral vision already. I don’t know what it is or what it wants, but I expect I’ll find out soon. One way or another.
