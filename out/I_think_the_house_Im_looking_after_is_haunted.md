Hey guys. I’m here for some advice because I’m really not sure what to do. Basically (and I know this is gonna sound crazy) but I think the place I’m house sitting is haunted. 

Ok, backstory. So last year my friend told me about this service she works with that places you with really rich people who need their houses looked after. It can be anywhere in the world and you basically get like a paid holiday and all you have to do is make sure these like multimillion dollar mansions don’t burn down or whatever. Which, since I’m trying to save as much as possible before next semester, was exactly what I was looking for. So, I sign up and they do the background checks or whatever and I get an offer to look after this place in Slovenia. I didn’t know this at first, but they don’t actually give you the address, you just get picked up and taken there- something about protecting the owner’s privacy. I’m a little freaked out already because I’m in this random country and they’re driving me just straight into the woods. Like no other houses or anything for miles. 

So the driver drops me off and I have this little check list of rules and things I’m supposed to do around the house. Like, I’m supposed to be barefoot in the house. Not no shoes, which I’d get, but actually barefoot. So weird but like fine whatever. It’s giving foot fetish but what do I care. At first its really fun. Its a big place and you feel a bit like a princess in a castle, pretending you own it or whatever. I was so tired after the trip, I was ready to get some sleep so I go around, make sure all the doors are locked and go to bed. In the morning I get up and go downstairs to get some breakfast, and thats when I see it. The front door is wide open. I’m thinking I know I locked it, but maybe there’s a trick to it, like I missed something. So I shut it and lock it again, but this time I make sure I put on the chain. I go to the kitchen to get breakfast and that’s when I start to hear the noises- like, something moving around upstairs. I’m thinking, big old mansion in the woods, it’s probably just the house settling or something. But I can’t quite shake it so I decide to go upstairs and check. When I got to the entry hall, I was totally freaked out- it definitely sounded like someone was upstairs. I called out and the noises stopped, which actually freaked me out more. 

This next bit is really stupid. I picked up this like, sculpture thing to use as a club and I went upstairs. I checked every room, locking every door as I go, but nothing had been disturbed. I guessed I was just nervous and hearing things so I went back downstairs. That’s when I saw it- this little rubber ducky thing. Like the one’s kids play with in bath. It definitely wasn’t there before, all the doors were definitely locked, and I was definitely alone in the house. I was so freaked out I didn’t know what to do, so I called the groundsman, who’s number they’d given me on emergency contacts. He basically laughed it off, until I’d told him about the duck. Then he got really quiet and told me to lock myself in my room and not come out until he called me back. I’m in my room now, but I’m really freaked out. I think I should leave but I don’t even know how to get to the airport. I’m only supposed to be here two more days, but I’m not even sure I can stay another night. What do you think- should I bail or stick it out?
