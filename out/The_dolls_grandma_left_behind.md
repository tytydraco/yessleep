I never thought I would come back to Grandma’s house. Not after she died, not after the nightmares started. But here I am, sifting through dusty furniture and faded photographs, trying to make sense of the life she left behind. The air smells like mothballs and old carpet, the kind of smell that sticks to your lungs and refuses to leave.

As I move through the living room, a memory hits me, sharp and unwelcome. I am six years old again, small and terrified, my grandmother’s sharp voice echoing as she shoves me into the closet. She said it was for my own good, that I needed to learn patience or manners or something. But I knew better.

Inside that closet, I would sit with the doll. The one she kept propped in the corner. Life-size, porcelain face, eyes too wide, too real. I swore it would move when I blinked, a hand shifting slightly, a head tilting just enough to catch me watching. I told myself it was just my imagination. But my six-year-old self knew.

I laugh nervously to myself and walk down the narrow hallway toward the old guest bedroom. The closet is still there. The door looks the same, scuffed at the bottom, the little brass knob tarnished with age. My heart starts beating faster.

I reach for the handle.

Inside, it is dark. The shape is unmistakable. The doll. My stomach drops. It is standing there, just like I remember, staring at me with that impossible, patient smile.

I take a step forward. My hand brushes the doorframe. The closet door swings shut behind me.

I try to pull it open. It will not budge.

The darkness presses in, thicker than the air outside. My breath comes in shallow, ragged gasps. Then I hear it, a faint creak, like the doll is shifting, turning its head.

I am trapped. And suddenly, I realize I never left the closet in the first place.

My fingernails scrape against the old wood as I yank at the knob. For a sick second I am sure it is not going to open, that I am going to die in this closet with the thing I have feared since I was a kid. Then, with a groan, the door finally gives way and I stumble backward into the bedroom.

The doll falls forward, its porcelain limbs clattering against the floorboards.

It is not smiling anymore.

The once-patient face is twisted, jaw open just enough to show faintly carved teeth, its painted eyes narrowed into an expression I can only describe as rage. The lips, cracked with age, look like they are about to split open and scream.

I do not wait to find out. I bolt.

I am halfway down the hall before I realize I am running toward the kitchen. The smell of old spice racks and stale coffee hits me, a smell I have not known in decades. My heart is hammering so hard it feels like the walls are shaking with it.

And then I see it.

On the counter, between a stack of yellowed newspapers and an unplugged toaster, sits a toy I have not seen in thirty years. A thick, hollow plastic Pillsbury Doughboy. Its tiny hands frozen in a mock wave, that stupid little chef’s hat perched on its head.

My knees go weak. Suddenly I am seven again.

I can hear it, even now, the soft pitter-patter of plastic feet running across the linoleum at night. The giggle. That high-pitched hoo-hoo echoing from the dark kitchen while everyone else slept. I used to tell my grandma about it and she would slap me for making up stories. But it was not a story. I remember it.

A sound breaks me out of the memory. A thud from outside. Heavy, like something hitting the wall just under the kitchen window.

I spin, yanking the curtain aside. Nothing. Just the dead yard and the skeletal remains of her rose bushes.

When I turn back, the Doughboy’s head is gone.

It is sitting next to the toy’s body on the counter, separated cleanly as if someone had popped it off like a bottle cap.

And the tiny, hollow body is still standing perfectly upright.


I needed to get out of the kitchen. Out of the house. But something inside me said do not run. Maybe it was pride. Maybe it was Grandma’s voice, the one I still sometimes heard in my sleep.

I forced myself back into the living room, trying to ignore the noise of my own heartbeat. The smell of dust and mothballs clung to everything. I grabbed a cardboard box from the pile near the sofa and started tossing her knick-knacks into it just to keep my hands busy. China teacups. A cracked snow globe. A dozen little figurines she kept on a shelf I was never allowed to touch.

As I wrapped each piece in yellowed newspaper, another memory bubbled up. Grandma sitting in her chair late at night, chain-smoking with the lights off except for the glow of the TV. She would tell me things back then, half-lullabies, half-warnings.

I know how to tie my spirit to an object, she said once, her voice low and rasping. When I pass, I can stay in this realm. Watch over you. Protect you from the evil world.

I thought she was just scaring me, or trying to make herself sound magical. She even showed me once. She pressed a hand against one of her little trinkets, a porcelain cat, a silver thimble, and whispered something under her breath. I did not understand the words. She said the items were her eyes. Her hands.

Now, packing up these same knick-knacks, I notice something. The items are warm. Not just warm from the house, warm like skin.

I drop one into the box and it rattles against the others. I swear I hear something shift in the next room, like a chair being dragged across the floor.

Grandma always said she would never leave me alone. She said she would be here when the world turned ugly.

And all at once it hits me, maybe she was not lying.


I freeze as I hear it, the soft gurgle of a percolator bubbling in the kitchen. The smell hits me, thick and red, almost black, curling through the stale air like it never left.

I step toward the sound, every muscle in my body screaming not to, and push open the kitchen door.

The sight almost stops my heart.

The doll is sitting in one of the kitchen chairs, its face still twisted with anger, jaw set, eyes burning like coals. The Pillsbury Doughboy sits on the table, headless, but now its hollow little face mirrors the same rage, like it learned from the doll.

And there she is. My grandmother. Smoke curling from the end of her cigarette like a wisp of something unreal, leaning against the counter as if she never left. She pours coffee into two mugs, hands steady and calm, completely normal except everything around her is not.

Her shadow stretches across the floor and the walls. At first it mimics her movements. Then it does not. It slithers and lingers, separating from her form, twisting as if watching me, alive in a way she is not.

Stop pissing your pants, James, she says, voice low and amused, the smoke curling around her like a halo. Come have some coffee with me.

The smell is intoxicating, warm, familiar, almost sweet in its thickness, but the color makes my stomach twist. My heart pounds, but against all reason, against all fear, something in me steps forward.

Her eyes meet mine. They are the same eyes I remember, soft, knowing, but there is something else there now. Something patient. Watching. Waiting.

And for the first time, I realize she has not left me. She never really left.
