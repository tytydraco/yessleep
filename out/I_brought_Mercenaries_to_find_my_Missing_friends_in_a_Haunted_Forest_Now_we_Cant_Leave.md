The moon turned black, the sky is raining blood, and the trees are moving. I think they just used my friends as a ritual sacrifice to initiate the apocalypse.

Before I get into how we are trapped in a haunted forest that never ends, I’ll quickly explain why I’m in a haunted forest hunting a cult/search and rescue for my missing friends with ex-SAS mercs.

After my friends went missing the other night, the police sergeant in charge of the investigation told me:

> “I don’t know how you got out and I don’t want to know. Don’t ever come back here, kid. Not just Cannock Chase—I mean the whole county. If we hear from you again, I’ll name you prime suspect for the disappearances of your weirdo mates.”

That flipped a switch in my head. The police aren’t incompetent or lazy. They’re actively covering up whatever those things are doing in the forest.

My mum picked me up from the station. I haven’t told her much—she’s worried sick though. I waited for her to go to sleep, then logged into her computer. She doesn’t do cyber security stuff. I don’t want to say how much money I took from her.

I forgot to mention this, but my mother is incredibly wealthy. So taking her funds to hire private, not-very-legal mercenaries seemed like the next best step.

I had been speaking to a guy online—he’s ex-SAS (UK special forces) and has a team ready to go. I paid them a ridiculously high amount of money in crypto and they were game.

The leader says to call him Milo. The rest of his men he says to call Trooper 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. They’re kind of secretive like that, I guess. They picked me up in their truck, all wearing balaclavas. Nice guys when they’re not pointing a gun at you. They handed me a pistol for my own peace of mind. I’ve never fired one, but it seemed handy to have.

We got to Cannock Chase forest early, around 7 a.m., and parked in that same gravel car park facing the tree line. I was trying not to cry or scream and look like a baby in front of these macho military guys.

I told them the rules.

* It gets dangerous when the sun goes down.
* Do not split up. Not into smaller teams, and certainly never alone.
* The things in the forest—whoever they are—they stalk you. They hide behind the trees and peek at you.

Now’s a good time to mention they thought I was crazy. They believed there was probably a group of lunatics, maybe even doggers, who had taken their activities too far and started abducting and/or killing. The guys still thought I was overreacting, but paid work is paid work, they said.

We crossed the bridge. It never gets easier crossing this damned bridge. I’d hoped the bridge would just collapse already with me on it, at least then I wouldn’t have to go back into these woods.

We patrolled the forest all day. Nothing. There was nothing. The place really isn’t all that bad in the day; I can see why people don’t believe me.

It was only as the sun began to set that we finally found the clearing. Something was different though.

The ground looked charred and burned, like a fire had been lit there. Not to mention the fresh, wet blood covering the forest floor. The team got shaken. They began pointing their rifles in all directions.

“This is the same clearing they took your friend in, right?” Milo said to me.

“Yeah, this is the exact same one. I think this is where they do something to the people. Like a sacrifice or ritual or something,” I said nervously.

“These blood stains look less than an hour old, skipper. Whoever did this is nearby,” Trooper #1 said to Milo.

As if we weren’t spooked enough, the moonlight shining into the forest changed. The sweet glow switched to a dark, beaming shadow.

The moon… turned black. Like a piece of coal in the sky.

The mercs looked at the moon and gasped in shock.

“That’s impossible. What the hell is this place, kid?” Trooper #2 screamed at me.

“We need to leave right now,” Milo commanded. We could tell he was done playing around here.

“Not until we find my missing friends. We can’t leave without them!” I screamed back, holding back tears.

There were no clouds, but the sky began to rain. Then we looked closer at the rain as it landed on us. It was thick and red.

Milo and his team began to run back in the direction of the bridge. I had no choice but to follow them. We ran as the thick red rain drenched us and the black moon cast its shadow.

They kept running until Milo ordered a quick halt.

“The bridge should be right here!” Milo cried, his composure beginning to crumble in front of his men.

They looked at their watches. The time hadn’t changed since the sun set.

They checked their GPS—no signal.

They checked their radios—nothing, not even within arm’s length.

They pulled out their compasses. All frozen, each pointing in different directions. No tampering could change them.

Oddly enough, we had a faint Wi-Fi signal though.

A cluster of leaves smothered my face. I couldn’t breathe. I tried to wipe them off but there were too many. The fallen leaves swarmed my entire body like a cocoon, suffocating me. It was tightening around me like being vacuum-sealed in plastic.

One of the mercs slashed me with his knife, then pulled my neck hard. I was bleeding, but I was free from the leaf swarm. The leaves were surrounding all of us now, like a pack of wolves. The men had their knives out, slashing away just to breathe.

Milo went berserk. A combat knife in each hand, hacking away at the boards of dead leaves in the barbaric wind that was trying to swallow his men.

This was not natural. This was not in my head. The forest was trying to kill us.

After Milo made sure his last man was free, we sprinted away. The leaves followed, the red rain shooting down on us like bullets, weighing down each step.

I was so cold, so drenched in thick red fluid. The leaves had left tiny cuts all over my body, like little thorn pricks.

Then we saw a hole in the ground, big enough to fit a person. We stopped and crouched by it. Trooper #4 turned on his night vision equipment and lowered himself in, the other men holding him by a rope attached to his harness.

“It’s a tunnel system—we can wait out the storm in here,” Trooper #4 shouted up to us.

We lowered ourselves into the hole one by one, the apocalypse of leaves and heavy rain still closing in.

Inside, we saw a tunnel only about 5 feet tall—you’d have to crouch to get through it. The hole was around 10 feet deep into the ground.

“I have no doubt those people you saw have been using this as a tunnel system, kid,” Milo said to me calmly.

“We need backup, skipper,” Trooper #1 said to Milo anxiously.

“I have some men, not exactly on standby for this op, but they’ll come help us if I ask. If we can still get that internet signal, I’ll email them for help,” Milo said.

At this moment, we realized we were well and truly stuck. The forest itself was trying to eat us.

I panicked and texted my best friend—the one I haven’t spoken to since Claudia went missing with us two years ago. Connor had to know I’d seen Claudia here again. I needed his help right now. I texted him on social media:

> “Connor, I know we haven’t spoken since that night we ran from those people, but I came back and saw Claudia the other night. Now I’m here with guns for hire but the forest has trapped us—we can’t find the bridge. Please come and help us. We need to bring Claudia home.”

In my heart I expected to be left on delivered.

Connor messaged back right away, in less than a minute.

> “I’m on my way.”

Milo and his team sat down against the tunnel walls, flashlights on and rifles in hand.

“Alright boys, the cavalry is on its way. We need to hang tight here and then we should be able to exfil,” Milo said swiftly to his team.

One of the troopers sitting closest to where the tunnel continued kept looking and looking into the darkness. He turned off his flashlight, put on night vision, and aimed his rifle into the darkness. The other men didn’t need to hear a command—they followed, leaving the tunnel in pure darkness, rifles raised.

That’s where I am now. In a pitch-black tunnel, with mercenaries aiming their rifles into the rest of this pitch-black tunnel. Waiting for more mercenaries and my best friend to come and save us. That’s only if the cult—or the forest from hell—doesn’t kill us first.

From somewhere deep in the tunnel, a sound echoed back toward us.
Not footsteps. Not breathing.
