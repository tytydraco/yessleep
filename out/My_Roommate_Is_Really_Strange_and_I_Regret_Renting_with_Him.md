Two months. Two months was the peaceful time I had.

I couldn’t stand the hell it was living with my parents anymore. When young adults reach a certain age, we tend to stray from our parents’ standards because we want to live for ourselves.

I already had a job, earning minimum wage, but I really wanted to move out. So, I did what anyone in my situation would do: I looked for an easy, affordable place to live. It took a while to find a place within my budget. Even small studio apartments are really expensive nowadays. I found a man renting a room that included food, internet, bathroom, everything in the house — André. It was perfect for me, only 500 reais a month, and my salary covered that with 1,000 reais left over. It was perfect.

I remember being nervous during the interview. The photo in the ad showed a man who looked intimidating. Pale, tall, with a piercing gaze and a wide smile. Now, I realize he was naturally creepy, but back then, I had no reason to be afraid.

At least he was polite. The house was big, and my room was nice, with a TV and a small couch facing the bed. It smelled clean, as if he had tidied everything before I arrived. I felt like the luckiest person alive, because the ad didn’t describe the room—I expected the worst. It was like a fairytale for a young worker like me.

The interview was smooth. He seemed a bit lost, but I thought it was just nerves. He said he needed some extra money but didn’t want it to be difficult to get. That’s why he priced the room low. He said he liked having company because he felt lonely. I told him my situation, and he seemed touched. He even gave me a copy of the key. It was easier than I thought.

The first week went well. I worked all morning and came home for lunch. I didn’t know André’s routine, but over time I noticed.

He woke up every day at 4 a.m. I thought he worked in another city, which seemed normal, since I’d done the same when I was younger, commuting for school. Sometimes I woke at night to hear the shower running. He always left his bedroom door wide open but never came into mine, and I didn’t want to lose my great room. If I respected his space, he’d respect mine, right? Fair enough.

He left at 5 a.m. every day. His schedule was always exact. He went to the kitchen at 4:20, turned on the TV at 4:25 to eat while watching. He never noticed me watching his routine. He came back at 10 p.m. sharp. I cooked dinner for both of us at first, but he never ate. I asked him to join me at the table, but he always said, “Thanks, I’m full. Enjoy your meal.” Always in the same tune. I gave up after the third day.

What started to bother me was his routine. Like him, I woke at the same times, and it was hard to fall asleep again. But I didn’t want to lose the privilege of paying 500 for a room with so much included. So I kept it to myself.

He always made the same noises, like a robot. One night I stayed up working on a project that could help me get a raise. It was 4:05 a.m. on a Monday, with a 700ml thermos of espresso next to me while I typed on my laptop in bed. The shower started running.

I was stressed and had a headache. I considered sleeping and finishing the work at the office minutes before the presentation. But I pushed on. At 4:25, the TV was louder than usual. I opened my door and saw the whole house dark except for the TV light shining down the hallway to our rooms. I asked André if he could turn down the volume. No answer. I asked again, and he turned it off without a word.

The silence was explosive. A feeling of unease hit me. I was afraid my stress had upset him. Only my room’s light lit the hallway. I didn’t hear a sound from André after that. I closed my door and listened, but nothing.

After a while, I heard his car leave. I went to the living room and saw him leaving through the window. The sun was rising. I hurried to finish my presentation and get ready for work.

That evening, he arrived at 10 p.m. sharp as always. He opened the door, paused two seconds, then closed it behind him. I paused my show and asked if I’d bothered him earlier. He gave me a distant, alert look but said nothing and went straight to his room.

I felt like I’d done something wrong. I stayed quiet, no matter what. That feeling of a lump in my throat was hard to explain.

The next morning, at 4 a.m., no shower sound. At 5 a.m., his car left. At 6 a.m., I noticed the couch in front of my bed was sunken in one spot. It confused me.

Days later, the couch spot was still sunken. On the sixth day, I woke to my door opening — a shadowy figure. André. He closed the door and sat across from my couch, staring at me. I froze. It was 4 a.m. He stayed for an hour, then left for work.

He did this for five days straight. I wondered if he would do it again. Just thinking about it made me crazy. At work, I could only think about it.

After the sixth day, I started locking my door. On the seventh day, I woke to him trying to open it.

His behavior made me anxious. I planned to leave. I asked a friend if I could stay with her for a few days. She said yes. Fátima is my best friend from school, the only one left. I left a note on my door saying I was with family for a birthday, not telling André.

The first day at Fátima’s was hard, but at least I could breathe. I kept hearing André trying my door open. I fell asleep after 2 a.m. I didn’t tell Fátima what was going on because she’d worry and call the police, file a report, get a restraining order. I’d already decided to return, grab my stuff, and never go back.

I hated myself for going back. Looking at the house was horrible. I imagined what he could do when I wasn’t there.

I unlocked the door, trembling. The street was emptier than usual for 2 p.m. The silence was oppressive. I felt like the walls watched me.

I went straight to my room, like a scared kid, drank water, then hid under the covers. The house felt alive.

I stayed in my room all day, sometimes opening the door to check if he’d arrived. His door across from mine was always ajar. I watched the front door, shaking with fear.

At 10 p.m., he came home. I stared at my phone clock from 9:57 to 10:00. I played music loud and left the light on to seem busy.

I heard his footsteps grow louder. My heart pounded as he neared. He stood at my door for three seconds. I held my breath. Then he closed the door and left.

I fell asleep eventually.

In the morning, I grabbed the recording from the camera I’d installed to catch him invading my privacy. I wasn’t crazy — he did come into my room at 2 a.m., sat staring at me for an hour, tried to pull the blanket off.

I stopped watching. I couldn’t face more trauma.

That day, I packed my bags, ready to leave.

Before leaving, I looked at his door, always in front of mine, taunting me.

Anger replaced fear.

I went into his room. I left my things on the bed and switched on the light. The door was usually open, but I closed it fully, bracing myself.

The room was normal. Ridiculously normal. A made bed, a few technical books, no photos. A lamp. TV off. A wardrobe with suits like he always wore to work. Everything neat.

It was staged. I didn’t want to believe it.

I left and took the recording and bags.

I heard his voice, muffled and trembling.

I grabbed a glass jar for protection and went to the room.

It was dark. I used my phone flashlight to look under the bed.

There it was — the floor wasn’t really the floor.

A wooden hatch, with a small circular cut disguised as a natural knot. A handle.

A secret cellar beneath his bed.

I moved the bed and descended three creaking wooden steps. The room was lit by yellow bulbs hanging by exposed wires.

There were cardboard boxes, a rusty metal cabinet, an improvised surgery table with straps, and strange liquids on the floor.

And there he was, curled up, dirty, hair tangled, mouth gagged with gray tape, hands and feet tied.

It was André. His face swollen and bruised, eyes full of fear, sunken like black holes.

He saw me, tried to get up, but couldn’t hold himself. He tried to mumble through the gag, crying, crawling toward me.

I slowly approached, in a trance. I removed the gag and cut his bonds.

He coughed and gasped, voice hoarse, barely understandable:

“Who… who are you?”

How could my tenant not recognize me?

Suddenly, a knock at the front door.

It was 10 p.m.

Only one person could be arriving at that time.

That voice stunned me so much I dropped the knives.

The door opened with desperation. The cold night wind rushed in.

I ran up the stairs screaming for my life.

I hid in André’s closet, among his clothes smelling of wood.

I twisted inside, praying to every god and orixá to keep me alive.

From the right side came André’s voice — gentle, calm:

“Clarice, I know what you saw. Whatever he told you… he’s manipulating you. He’s a duplicate. He made himself look like me. He trapped someone who saw too much and put him in the cellar to make it convincing. He’s done it before.”

That was the first time he said my name.

From the left side came the other André’s voice — desperate, shouting:

“Don’t believe him, Clarice! He’s a monster disguised as a man! I’m the real one, you have to believe me!”

The other André moved closer down the hallway.

“Clarice, I protected you all this time. I gave you everything practically for free. I never touched you.”

“He wants to study you, become you, take your life because he can’t stay in the same body long.”

Their voices grew closer to the closet.

I was shaking and sweating. My fingernails scratched my cheeks as I covered my mouth.

I looked down, moaning softly, tears streaming.

I wanted to be Lucy and have that closet magically take me to Narnia.

Outside, silence. The two had stopped arguing.

Then the closet door started moving — someone was opening it.

I heard it.

Both Andrés spoke at the same time, right in front of the closet.

“Clarice, believe me.”

With the door wide open, I saw the dark room, but two eyes — one from each André — staring deep into mine.

They were empty, doll-like, with no reflection, glowing fluorescent yellow.

I swear to God I could feel them smiling.

On impulse, I jumped out, crashing into both of them.

I don’t know what happened next.

The cold street wind hit me like a bullet — André had left the house door open.

I ran without looking back.

I could feel their gaze burning from the door to the street.

I stopped five blocks away when a biker almost hit me.

I looked back; they were far behind.

I think I’ve never run so fast in my life.

I went straight to the police station.

I entered sweating and shaking. My legs hurt.

The officers there were shocked and stopped what they were doing to help me.

They gave me water, sat me down, and asked questions.

Of course, no one believed me.

“Perfect timing?”

“Secret cellar?”

“Duplicates?”

Who would believe this?

But I had the recording. Luckily, it was the last thing I grabbed and I kept it in my jacket pocket.

I showed them André sitting, staring at me for an hour, then getting up and coming close.

The officer went silent and called a superior.

I knew they thought I was crazy.

A public defender was assigned against André’s case.

Thanks to that, I wasn’t hospitalized.

They filed an official report, but the file said:

“Confused report, potential paranoid delusion. Recording shows strange behavior but inconclusive. No evidence of abuse. No proof the abuser is real.”

Two hours later, I returned with three officers to the house.

Empty.

No sign of André… or either André.

The house was clean, spotless. Like a four-day cleaning.

The officers exchanged looks and whispered about me.

I was the crazy story.

In my old room, my things were on the bed, just as I left.

I grabbed everything and left angry.

I looked at his room — empty.

I crouched, and the cellar had vanished like salt dissolving in water.

Where the wooden hatch had been, now was a polished, level floor.

The metal cabinet, the lamp, the smell… nothing.

No sign of anything.

The detective said the house had been rented to someone else three months ago, which I knew was impossible.

I told them so, explaining the whole story like a play.

The officers exchanged looks.

One tried to hide a laugh.

The other wrote something in a notebook and said:

“Case closed.”

It’s been two years.

The case never progressed.

I had no proof. I didn’t even have André’s full name, just “André.”

Neither of them appeared.

Even with the detective defending my evidence, the police called it a “stress-induced psychotic episode.”

I cleared my name seven months later.

But my mind was never the same.

Since then, I live with Fátima.

She took me in again, no questions, no judgment.

Like she knew asking would only make it worse.

We grew closer.

She believed every word I told her.

But I don’t know if I believe her.

If someone told me this, I wouldn’t believe it, because I’m very down-to-earth.

“It would never happen to me because I’m hard to fool,” I’d say.

I’m the friend who watches true crime and horror movies and thinks this stuff is far from my reality.

But the perfect rental offer blinded me at the right time. I let my guard down.

Since then, I’ve had big trust issues.

I’m still in therapy.

Sometimes I wake at night with nightmares of a duplicate chasing or killing me in abandoned places.

Fátima and I share a small apartment full of plants and light.

Her company brought me back to routine. Sometimes even to laughter.

I catch myself wondering what would have happened if I’d stayed longer in that house.

If I had ignored everything André did.

If I hadn’t done what I did, would I still be alive?

I still don’t know which André was the real one: the one in the cellar or the one in the house.

I know I’m very lucky. Really lucky.

Fátima started dating a guy a few months ago.

He seems nice. Polite, handsome, I like him.

I’ve never seen anything strange.

His name is Jonas.

They get along well.

Even with my constant suspicion — which has become part of me — I try not to interfere.

For a moment, I thought I could live in peace.

But tonight…

I woke up to a sound in the hallway.

I don’t know what exactly woke me.

It was a continuous whisper, repeated, like the hum of a fridge.

Like someone rehearsing their thoughts aloud.

I got up slowly and went to my door without turning on the light.

I put my ear to it.

On the other side… silence.

I checked my phone: 10 p.m.

I almost went back to bed when I heard his voice.

Fátima’s boyfriend.

Jonas.

Calm, drawn-out tone, like he was waiting there.

He said:

“Took you long enough to find me. You still owe me the rent. This time… I’m not asking for money.”

He repeated it, over and over.

I don’t know how many times.

I’m writing this now. It’s about 1:57 a.m.

If I disappear, if someone finds this text or my phone, for the love of God, please believe me.

He’s back.

He remembers me.

I don’t know if he stepped away from my door.

And honestly? I’m too scared to check.
