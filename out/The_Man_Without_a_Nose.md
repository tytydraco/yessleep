A few years ago, I took a trip to Rome to visit a Van Gogh exhibition. Besides visual arts, I've always been deeply fascinated by the concept of magic, particularly black magic. Just days before my trip, I had immersed myself in books on the subject, convincing myself that magic was real—dangerously real. I would spend hours poring over ancient texts, absorbing forbidden knowledge, my mind racing with the thought that perhaps reality was more malleable than I had ever imagined. My obsession with the occult had become more than mere curiosity—it was an unshakable conviction.

The exhibition was mesmerizing. Van Gogh’s thick, chaotic strokes felt alive, as if his torment still pulsed beneath the paint. The swirls of color, the violent intensity—it all resonated with the strange energies I had been exploring in my readings. But as night fell and I made my way to Termini Station, I felt an inexplicable heaviness settle over me, as if something unseen had begun to take notice.

I was lost in thought when I first saw him.

A homeless man emerged from the shadows. His face was covered in filth, his clothes tattered beyond recognition, but it wasn’t his appearance that unsettled me—it was the fact that he had no nose. A dark, cavernous void sat in its place, like an empty window into something unnatural. My stomach turned at the sight of it, a deep, primal fear clawing at my insides. It was as if he wasn’t entirely human.

He stretched out a trembling hand. "Spare some change?" he croaked, his voice dry and rasping, as if his throat had been scorched from within.

I hesitated but gave him a few coins, my fingers brushing against his. His skin was icy cold.

Then he looked up at me, his hollow gaze boring into mine, and asked: "Do you believe in magic?"

A chill ran down my spine. I had spent days convincing myself of its power, reading forbidden texts, and now, here in the dim glow of Rome’s busiest station, a faceless beggar was asking me this question. His presence felt wrong, as if he had stepped out of one of the grimoires I had been reading.

"Yes," I whispered, almost involuntarily.

His cracked lips twisted into something that might have been a grin. "Then give me 50 euros."

I recoiled. "No."

His face darkened, his empty nose cavity seeming to expand like a gaping wound. He muttered something under his breath—a guttural, inhuman string of syllables that sent ice through my veins. The words didn’t belong to any language I knew, but they carried a weight, a force that pressed against my skull. My vision blurred for a moment. Then, from his grimy pocket, he produced a small, plastic coin and pressed it into my hand.

"Take it," he hissed. "Yours now."

My breath came fast and shallow. The coin felt unnatural, too smooth, too light. I didn’t want it. My pulse thundered as I dropped it into a nearby trash can and hurried away, my legs trembling beneath me. I told myself he was just another desperate man, trying to make a living through trickery. But deep down, I knew something was wrong. Something had shifted in the air around me, like an invisible thread had been pulled.

Days later, I lost my mind.

I became erratic, violent. I screamed in the streets. I claimed to be God. It was as if something had cracked inside me, my thoughts spiraling out of control. I felt something watching me, whispering in my dreams. I was forcibly hospitalized, strapped to a bed while doctors injected me with sedatives. They told me I had bipolar disorder and that I would never recover. But their words felt hollow, like a script they had repeated a thousand times before.

But they were wrong.

I found my way back—not through medicine alone, but through faith. I turned to the Church, to Jesus, and over time, I was healed. Slowly, the madness receded, like a tide pulling away from the shore. I returned to a normal life, one free from the darkness that had nearly consumed me.

And then, recently, while reading *The Cloud of Unknowing*, an ancient Christian mystical text, I came across something that made my blood freeze.

In one passage, the author warns that Satan sometimes manifests in human form—specifically, as a person without a nose. The reason? So that those who look at him can see inside his head, where his bleeding brain is the very essence of Hell itself. Staring into it brings madness.

That’s when I understood.

That night at Termini Station, I hadn’t just met a beggar.

I had met the Devil.

And he had tried to claim me.
