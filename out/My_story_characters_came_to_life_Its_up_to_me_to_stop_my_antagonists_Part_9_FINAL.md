“It sounds like we’ve got our work cut out with this one,” Sidney said.

“Yeah, it probably won’t be easy to track him down. I really shouldn’t have given him such a common name.”

“I’m glad someone said it. Davy Jones? You couldn’t have picked a more cliche sailor name,” Jake chortled as he tousled my hair.

I glared at him.

“Does anyone have any ideas? I doubt he has any social media, but even if he does, the odds of finding him are seriously low,” I inquired.

“Maybe the boat can help us? Is there, like, a registry we can search or something?” Sidney suggested.

“That’s a great idea! Try to find anything you can on the internet. The boat is called ‘The Queen Elizabeth’s Revenge*.’*” 

I spun around in my chair and began furiously typing. 

“Found it,” Jake said.

“Really? That was fast. What’d you search?” Sidney asked.

“The simplest thing I could think of. Boatregistry.com.”

“That’s ironic,” I muttered, “what’s it say?” 

“It’s says it’s registered to a Davy Jones, and he lives in a really small town right outside Tampa.” 

“Woohoo, road trip!” Sidney yelled.

“Yeah. Woohoo. Everyone get your stuff ready and prepare for a really long drive. It looks like it’s about seven hours from here.”

We all re-packed our bags from the last trip, and we were off in no time. The rising sun cast a warm yellow glow over the land as we set off for our adventure. It was sort of tranquil, if I’m being honest. Aside from the fact that we were off to fight some archaic malevolent force, that is. Just good music, great company, and seven hours of nothing but highway. I almost didn’t want it to end. So, when we arrived in a little town called Marbury, I found myself feigning excitement for the end of our drive.

“We should be able to find the wharf pretty quickly, right?” Sidney chirped from the passenger seat. 

“That’s what I’m hoping for. In a small town like this, I doubt it’ll be too difficult,” I said.

“Good call, bro. Look.” 

Jake jabbed his finger into my face, nearly causing me to swerve into the opposite lane. 

“All I could see was your enormous finger blocking my view. What did it say?”

“Oops,” he murmured.

“It said ‘wharf in five miles,’” Sidney interjected.

“Awesome. See, Jake? *That’s* how you point something out without nearly running me off the road.”

“Whatever. What’s the plan for killing this thing anyway?” 

“See those noise-canceling earphones in the seat next to you? We’re going to wear those and hope that her screams can’t penetrate them.”

“And what are the water guns for?”

A wide grin plastered itself across my face.

“That’s my favorite part. This thing doesn’t like water, right?” 

“So… we’re going to shoot it with super-soakers?” Sidney asked.

“Yeah. Do you have any better ideas? I didn’t think so. Hopefully we can find this Davy guy and get him to take us back to where he met that abomination. I doubt anyone else will know about it,” I said as we rolled over a hill, revealing a small dock with boats dotted sparsely among it. 

We rolled to a stop in the parking lot, and prepared ourselves for a long day of searching for a man that we only had a story to reference. We trudged to the dock and clacked across the wooden boards as the breeze ran its invisible fingers through our hair. I could almost taste the salt as we approached the water’s edge. 

“Um, am I seeing things, or is that the boat right there?” Jake asked, mouth agape.

“Uh… yeah. Good job, I guess. There’s no way it should’ve been this easy.”

“Yeah, get lost! One cigarette wouldn’t ah cost ya nothing, ya cheapskate!” a disheveled man shouted from atop the boat Jake had found. 

He brandished a whiskey bottle that he pointed vindictively at an old man in a Hawaiin shirt with a Marlboro jutting from between his lips. The old man flipped him off. 

“Fuck you, Davy! I wouldn’t give you one if your life depended on it.”

“Go fuck yourself, you slimy sack of shit. I hope you break your hip and drown in a foot of rainwater!” 

The man had already begun to storm off, again flashing Davy the finger as he went. The irate sailor then directed his attention to us.

“What are you gawking at? Hope you enjoyed the show. You can go screw yourselves too. Buzz off.”

“Um, sorry if we offended you or anything. We actually came to find you,” I said sheepishly.

“I already told you bastards; I’m not paying that car note. Beat it.”

“We’re not here about a car note. We’re here about your friends, John and Frank. Or, more pressingly I should say, the thing that killed them,” Jake confessed.

“The what?!” Davy yelled, holding a little bugle-like hearing aid to his ear.

“The siren,” Jake hollered.

“Louder, son. I can’t hear shit you’re saying.”

“The siren!” 

“The what?!” 

“THE SIREN!” 

Jake was practically screaming in the man’s face.

“Oh, so that’s what you landlubbers call it,” he said as a chill tremored his entire body.

“We were hoping you could show us where it lives. You don’t have to fight it with us, just take us to where you saw it,” I continued.

“No can do, young man. Too dangerous. Wouldn’t nothing get me to revisit that nightmare,” he mumbled, taking a long drag from his bottle.

“I thought you might say that. Would this sway your decision at all?” I asked, producing a crisp one-hundred-dollar bill from my pocket.

He chuckled. 

“It’ll take a little more than that-”

“Two hundred. Take it or leave it.”

“I-I don’t know if I could-”

“Alright, suit yourself. I guess I’ll just have to waste this on hookers and beer.”

“Woah, woah, woah. Hold your horses. I didn’t say no… Fine. Thirty minutes max, then we’re leaving, and I never want to see you miscreants again. Got it?”

We nodded in unison.

“Alright, careful stepping onto the boat now. Don’t scuff her up with your dirty shoes.”

Jake and I climbed aboard, and I took Sidney’s hand to hoist her up. We followed Davy to the cabin where we plopped onto the couch he’d had furnished inside. Davy slumped into his seat at the wheel. 

“I don’t want to have to do this, ya know.”

“We know,” Jake retorted.

“What?”

“We know!”

“What?!”

“WE KNOW.”

“WHAT?!”

“I SAID WE. KNOW!”

“I heard ya the first time. Just wanted to see how many times you’d repeat yourself.” 

“Asshole,” Jake whispered under his breath.

“Hey, I heard that!”

Davy threw the vessel into gear, and we sped along, flowing up and down with the waves. I took the opportunity to soak in our surroundings. The boat had been furnished with a couch, tv, and a kitchenette. Opposite us a bookshelf loomed, packed to the brim with novels and movies. Sleek oak cabinets lined the wall above the sink, presumably filled with non-perishables. The perfect vessel for days out on the open sea. Windows lined the watercraft, allowing us a clear view of the vast ocean encompassing us from all sides. 

“So, how did you kids know about my mates? I never told a soul what happened that night… And what’s with the squirt guns?” 

“It’s a long story,” I said, hoping he wouldn’t pry.

“I got time.”

I sighed.

“Alright, here it goes…”

I relayed everything I knew to him. He listened intently, hanging on every word. When I was done, he pursed his lips. 

“That story is pretty out there, boy.”

“I know it sounds ridiculous, but I promise that’s the truth.”

“I ain’t callin’ you a liar. I’ve seen the damned thing with my own eyes. That soul-sucker did God knows what to my friends. Wiped ‘em right off the face of the Earth.”

A tear trickled down his cheek as the words escaped his lips. He hurriedly wiped it away. 

“That’s why I’m takin’ you. It was never about the money. I mean, it didn’t hurt anything, but I want revenge. Nothing would make my soul more content than to see that monstrosity destroyed.”

“Well, that’s the plan,” Jake chimed in, “which is why we brought the super soakers. The siren doesn’t like water, so we’re planning on drenching it.”

“Not a bad idea. But I’ve got a better one. You, girl. See that bucket? Give it to me.”

“Girl? My name is Sidney,” she hissed as she begrudgingly followed his order. 

“Whatever floats your boat, miss. Pun intended.”

Sidney scowled at him. No one laughed.

“You three distract it with your pea shooters, and I’ll ambush it with this. That should do the trick. I hope.” 

I scanned my friends' faces to gauge their reactions. They nodded in approval. 

“Okay, so now that we have a plan, how long until we get there?” I asked.

“Funny you should say that. We’re here.”

Davy slowed the vessel to a crawl as we approached a cavern. The mouth of the cave ominously beckoned us inside. A shiver crawled up my spine as we gradually floated along. Sidney grabbed my hand. 

We continued to cruise, until Davy stationed us close to a receding beach at the far end of the cave. An impossibly dark pit tunneled further within, swallowing any light in its vicinity. A deep sense of dread bubbled inside me, consuming my mind like a jaguar devouring a fresh kill. 

“What the…” Jake mumbled, eyes wide and body trembling. 

Sidney’s fingers quivered in mine. 

“It’s going to be okay. We can do this. One last monster, then we can put all of this behind us,” I consoled her in a brittle shaky voice. 

I knew how weak I sounded. But it needed to be said. As much for Sidney’s sake as my own. 

“Ready? Let’s head onto the deck, Davy insisted, leading the charge.

We followed him above the lower level, wary of every creak and thump our footsteps produced. Upon stepping into the refreshing evening air, I immediately glanced up. Hundreds, if not thousands of stalactites glimmered stories above our heads. Light reflected off them like a grand chandelier. I stared in awe at the ornate stone formation, entranced by its beauty. 

“Enough with your starin’. You can look at the pretty rocks later. You brought ear protection, right? I’m mostly deaf already, so I ain’t got much to lose.”

“Oh, yeah, right. Here.”

I handed him a pair of earphones, resting my own around my neck. Jake and Sidney followed suit. 

“Perfect. Take your positions, everyone.”

We slipped from the boat one by one, splashing into the waist-high water. We marched to land like soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy. Jake and Davy stood to the right of the impossibly dark entrance, while Sidney and I stationed ourselves to the left. 

“When I give the word, put on your earphones,” Davy commanded. 

I flashed him a thumbs up. 

“Hey, woman! I’m back. I couldn’t resist your singin’!” Davy shouted into the all-encompassing black. 

I began to hear a melody emanating from within. My heart turned to ice. 

“Now!” 

I clapped the earphones onto my head and readied my super soaker. I felt like a navy seal on the front lines, ready to engage in battle. I leapt to the front of the passage just as an elegant woman emerged. Her appearance caught me off guard. A pricking sensation enveloped my back, like needles prodding my bare skin. 

The woman was stunning. Her beautiful eyes shimmered like the waves, casting a spell with their gaze. Perfect white teeth gleamed at us as she sang, nearly blinding me in the process. Long black hair flowed down to her sides like a lion’s mane. A spotless stark white nightgown hugged her petite form, advertising her body in all the right places. It was as if she was moving in slow motion. Each step seemed practiced. Calculated. 

A muffled song played beyond the earphones, enticing me to rip them from my ears. I quickly glanced over to Jake and Davy. To my abject horror, Jake’s earphones were still hanging around his neck, and he stood rooted to the spot, enthralled by the woman’s harmonious chords. Sidney raised her water gun. I blocked her, motioning to Jake. Davy noticed a second after we did. He rushed toward Jake and clasped the earphones to his head. 

Jake writhed and kicked, trying his best to break free of Davy’s iron grip. I didn’t waste any time. I sprayed the woman directly in the face. Her soothing melodic tunes instantly transformed into a shrill wail of agony. My eardrums pounded incessantly. I shuddered to think of the destruction it would cause to an unprotected ear. 

She dropped to her knees and threw her hands over her fizzling face. Sidney and I continued to relentlessly bombard her with water. Her skin bubbled and popped like hot magma. Davy slung Jake to the ground and darted for the bucket. He draped its contents over the crying lady. She immediately began melting into that all too familiar murky black puddle, steam billowing up to the ceiling. 

Davy stared in shock at the mush seeping into the sand. Jake gradually stopped thrashing on the ground long enough to take notice of what we had done. He sat up and began rocking back and forth. 

“It… it was beautiful. The most peaceful song I’d ever heard. I-I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay, Jake. She was an enchantress. It’s what they do. Now, let’s go home,” I said. 

“She’s… really gone. It’s over. May Frank and John finally be at peace,” Davy muttered. 

He fell to his knees and said a silent prayer. All the while tears stream down his cheeks. Once he was done, he abruptly rose and silently shuffled toward the boat. We followed, incrementally sloshing up to the vessel. The ride home was marred by a tense silence. None of us dared break Davy’s concentration. 

When we finally arrived back at the dock, it was nearly sunset. Vibrant yellows and reds splashed across the evening sky like paint on a fresh canvas. We stepped onto the deck, and I shut my eyes, relishing the feeling of the light breeze sweeping across my skin. A weight had been lifted. We were free. 

“Thank you, I guess,” Davy said, “have a safe trip home. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a hot date with some of the locals down at The Gold Club.”

We all chuckled as we hopped down onto the creaking boards. 

“Be safe out there. And don’t let the bedbugs bite, if you catch my drift,” I smirked.

“Ah, buzz off. I have a feelin’ I’ll be just fine.” 

He smiled as he disappeared into the parking lot. We took our time walking back to the car, itching for just another moment to drink in that breathtaking view. Eventually, we decided to sit on the back of my car, Jake opting to stand beside us, as we watched the sun dip below the horizon. Sidney rested her head on my shoulder, and I slid my arm around her. I wanted nothing more than to stay in that moment forever. I cherished every second that ticked by. 

“So, it’s all over, huh,” Sidney said.

“Yeah, I guess it is,” I responded.

“What are we going to do now?” Jake asked. 

“I guess we should start looking into motels. Any suggestions?”

“*Anything* but another Motel 6,” he chortled. 

“Duly noted,” I grinned.

“Before we go, I really have to piss. Turn around real quick?”

“Ew, no! I don’t want to hear you peeing. Go over there in the woods across the street,” Sidney said.

He nodded, and trotted across the street, disappearing into the foliage.

I turned to Sidney. The wind softly tousled her hair like a model during a photo shoot. Her eyes shimmered, and the way the waning light reflected off her face sent butterflies fluttering inside my belly. She looked beautiful. 

“So, um, there’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while now,” I said, anxiously rubbing the back of my neck, “I don’t know how to say this… I’ve never been the best with words, but… I just… I-”

“Oh, just shut up and kiss me already you idiot.”

She pulled me in close, and our lips locked. A shockwave of pure bliss coursed through my system, crashing down on me like a tidal wave. I savored every second. I kissed her more passionately than I’d ever kissed another girl in my entire life. My heart leapt with unabated happiness. This was it. The moment I’d been dreaming of for years. It was actually happening.

“What took you two so long? Finally!” Jake yelled, throwing his hands into the air as a big goofy smile smeared itself across his face.

He continued to beam at us as he jogged to the street. 

“I thought you’d never make a mo-”

*Crash…*

“Fuck. We forgot about [Zach.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yitafg/roadkill/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)”

I watched in terror as two tons of unforgiving steel barreled full speed into Jake’s body. The impact sent him flying into the air, and he landed on his back with a nauseating crunch. My high was immediately substituted with panic. Sidney and I sprinted to his aid. His limbs were mangled and twisted at weird angles. Deep lacerations and road burns encompassed his entire massive frame. He was bleeding everywhere, and he convulsed violently on the ground. Hot tears clouded my vision.

“Jake i-it’s going to be okay. We’re going to get you help. We can fix this,” I blubbered, holding his head in my palms. 

He attempted to speak through gurgly labored breaths.

“I-I w-wish. I wish. I w-wish…”

A torrent of dark liquid erupted from his mouth, coating his chest. 

“I wish it didn’t happen too, buddy. We’re going to help you, I promise,” I cried.

His eyes rolled back in his head, and his body went limp. 

“No, no, no, this can’t be happening. I can’t lose you too,” I wailed as I pounded the ground with my fist. 

The realization hit me like a freight train. I wish. I began frantically rummaging through Jake’s pockets. At the far end of the street, Zach had already maneuvered the car around, and he was rearing for another kill. I found what I’d been searching for as the vehicle came flying toward us. 

“I wish Zach had missed Jake and hit a streetlight, killing him on impact!” I shouted. 

I pinched my eyes closed, praying with all my might that my plan had worked. After what felt like an eternity, I painstakingly peeled them open. Jake was standing beside me, gawking at the steaming wreck before our eyes. I gazed at the monkey paw in wonder as the final finger curled closed.

Relief flooded over me, and for the second time that day, I found myself truly happy. I threw my arms around Jake, sobbing uncontrollably into his chest. Sidney soon joined me. We all stood there, holding each other until darkness draped itself over the landscape like a blanket. 

“I thought we lost you,” I murmured as we walked back to the car.

“It’ll take more than a few thousand pounds of metal to get rid of me, lil’ bro,” he said, ruffling my hair. 

And for once in my life, I didn’t mind.

In the end, Mason was set free from prison. The investigating authorities inevitably concluded that Zach was the one behind the murder he’d framed his roommate for. 

Our monster hunting days are over now. Well, sort of. Jake went on to become a police officer. He wears his badge with honor and pride, serving the community to the best of his abilities. Sidney and I started dating soon after we returned home. I’ve bought a ring, and I’m planning to propose soon. I thank God for her every day. 

As for me, I’ve picked up writing comedies. I’m hoping to use my ability to make a positive mark on the world. We never discovered the reason why my characters came to life. I may never get the closure that would accompany that knowledge, but for now, I’m content to keep it that way.
