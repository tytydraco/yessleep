The first note was in a book.

I picked up the book while I was browsing the library stacks for resources to write a research report. The book was clearly misshelved, a pocket-sized journal someone had left tucked in with the actual library books. On its cover was written DO NOT READ, with the name scratched out below, which of course intrigued me enough to open it.

It began:

*“In two weeks, I’m going to kill myself,” I announced to class this morning. And you know how the class responded? Silence.*

*I could see it in all their eyes. Scorn.*

*I will always remember how none of them tried to stop me…*

Wow. This was… raw. Intense. I was both repulsed and unable to tear myself from the pages filled with the author’s self-loathing. Halfway in, I stopped reading. It was so obviously personal. And the further I read, the more I felt as if… eyes were on me?

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.

That’s when a little scrap of lined paper fell out. The handwriting awkward. Clumsy. The point of the pencil pressed hard on the paper.

It read: *I HATE YOU*

I quickly looked around to see if anyone had noticed, picked up the paper and stuck it back in the book. It seems weird, but I almost felt as if someone had left the diary on purpose and was waiting to see who would pick it up and read it. I put it on the shelf and left, thinking nothing further about it. But that feeling, like someone hovering nearby, persisted.

The next day in class, I was shocked to find the diary nestled in my bag along with my textbooks. In my periphery, I thought I glimpsed a girl in a black dress, but when I glanced up I saw no one. Toward the end of class, when I reached into my pocket for my phone, I felt a rustle. Someone had tucked a note into my pocket and written in chunky strokes: *YOU DESERVE TO DIE*

I lifted my eyes to scan the classroom—a computer lab with a scattering of heads bent to glowing screens. No sign of the girl in black.

I crumpled the note and tossed it away.

Later I took the diary back to the library, intending to stick it right back on the shelf. Curiosity got the better of me on the way, and I read a bit further. It was all kind of… teen drama stuff? Girl meets boy, boy falls for popular girl, girl feels rejected and on top of it all gets bullied and ostracized for being the “weirdo” in her classes, girl summons demon…

Yeah. The last few pages got pretty out there. It seemed to have turned a corner from angsty journal to… whatever this was:

*The grinning version of me in the mirror had pointed teeth and hollows where its eyes should be. I asked if it was here to drag me to Hell. My wicked reflection asked me if that mattered. I thought of all the people who wronged me. The people who saw me drowning and did nothing. And I stared into my own reflection’s hollow eyes and said that I would destroy everyone—the girls who scorned me—the boy who broke my heart—and MOST OF ALL the people with pity in their eyes, who looked at me like I was a sad clown on the sidelines of their own self-important lives…*

*I will give the world one last chance.*

*Until October 5.*

*That’s when I will end… EVERYTHING.*

I checked the calendar.

October 5 was in two weeks.

That meant I had two weeks in which to confront this diary’s author and… convince her not to succumb to her inner demons, I guess?

Or at least not to do anything drastic that might harm herself or others. Since I was still pretty sure she was following me, I wrote a note on a sheet of paper and slipped it between the pages.

*Please don’t hurt anybody and certainly not yourself. How can I help you?*

Then I slid the book back onto the shelf.

\*\*\*

The lecture hall was mostly empty the next morning in class, sunbeams illuminating the dust. Students trickled in, slouched under backpacks and coats. Overhead, the projector whirred. I was distracted, trying to cram the answers for a pop quiz I was sure was coming—and then I felt it again. That sensation of being *watched*. My eyes drifted to my notebook and caught on the uneven scrawl of capital letters: *CUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WORLD*

I craned my neck to glance at the seats nearest me and over my shoulder behind me. But most of the classroom was empty except for me.

I rubbed at the goosebumps on my arms. Turned and slowly scanned the back row, wondering… was the author of that diary here? Was she angry I’d put it back? What was this?

A test?

A prank?

The notes persisted over the next few days. And every so often, I’d catch a glimpse of a figure just in the corner of my eye. A girl in a black dress. I had so many notes I started keeping them in a Ziploc bag:

*KILL YOURSELF. YOU SUCK. YOU SHOULDN’T BE ALIVE. HOW DARE YOU BREATHE. THE WORLD DOESN’T WANT YOU IN IT. DIE. DIE. DIE. DIE.*

One time, I almost caught her. I was sitting on a bench sipping coffee. It might have been only the wind that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. There came a flicker of motion in my periphery. A waifish girl all in black had her hand on my arm—but I was so startled I lost my balance and tumbled backward off the bench. When I got to my feet, she was already gone.

Recently, the threats escalated from notes to, well… attempted murder?

I don’t know how to classify it. What I do know is that when I took a sip from my thermos I immediately spat it out. It tasted like—well, I don’t know. It tasted *off.* Something had been mixed in with it, and I’m pretty sure it was some kind of chemical.

It seemed too obvious to be a real attempt to harm me. More of a… warning? A cry for attention? I dumped it out rather than taking it to the campus police.

I was fairly certain that if this person stalking me *was* in some sort of crisis, our campus police were the last people who were likely to be effective help for her. I went back to the library and found the diary—still on the shelf where I’d left it—and as I picked it up from the shelf and opened it, ostentatiously reading where anyone could see me, I *felt* it again. The sense of someone hovering near. Watching. As soon as I got that feeling, I deliberately tucked the diary into my bag and said loudly, “I’m here to help. Let me know how.”

Several students and the librarian at the reference desk looked up at me, and I blushed, but I just ignored them and walked out, taking the book with me.

I received an answer in the dead of night.

The campus neighborhood I live in is usually pretty safe, and sometimes I crack my windows at night.

I woke up out of a deep sleep with the feel of cold steel at my throat. For several seconds I lay tangled under my sheets, heart hammering, unable to open my eyes. I have night terrors sometimes where I can’t move. That was happening now. It was several seconds before I was finally able to sit up.

Something heavy and metallic clattered to the floor, and a breeze wafted from the open window. Looking on my floor, I saw a knife. And on the top page of the notebook that lay on my nightstand was a fresh warning:

*THE ONLY SALVATION—*

*—IS DEATH*

\*\*\*

The campus police told me to lock my windows and my door at night and took my description of the waifish goth girl. They also asked about the diary, but I lied that I didn’t have it with me. I felt certain if I handed it over I’d never see it again, and would lose my last chance to… I dunno, help its writer?

I didn’t want to think of her as a “sad clown on the sidelines” of my life. I wanted to extend a hand, or… something. To do more than everyone else who’d let her down, even if that put myself at risk.

Maybe my savior mentality was why she targeted me. I’ve been thinking about how she left her diary on the bookshelf for anyone to pick up. And I suspect, based on her ravings about how ugly the world is, that she planted her diary in a public place so that it would be read. She wanted someone to lash out at, someone who violated her privacy by reading her journal. But also—pouring chemicals into my thermos, breaking into my apartment—these struck me more as cries for attention than as serious attempts to hurt me.

Like, *Look at me! Look at my pain!*

And I felt more sorry for my stalker than fearful of her, even when the notes escalated in tone:

*CUT YOURSELF. CUT YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD. SOON. SOON.*

And hysterical warnings about the deadline:

*OCTOBER 5 IS THE END*

*ELEVEN DAYS*

*TEN DAYS*

I just didn’t have faith the campus police would handle any of this sensitively. So with ten days left, I took the journal back to the library and asked the woman at the reference desk if she’d seen anybody tuck this onto the bookshelves or had any idea who it might belong to. I showed her the notes and explained that I was being threatened and needed to find out by whom.

The librarian took one look at the notes and said, “The person who wrote this diary and the person who wrote the notes are probably not the same person.”

“Uh…” I frowned. “Why do you say that?”

“The handwriting is different.”

She was right, and I felt such a fool for not noticing sooner. The diary was in ball-point pen. But the notes were in gel pen, sharpie, on all different kinds of paper… and written in wobbly block capitals.

“… Ok. But I still need to know who she is,” I said. “I’m running out of time before she… Well, she doesn’t say it explicitly, but I think October 5 she’s going to kill herself.”

I opened the diary to some of the last pages, where it was less coherent and mostly dark squiggles and gibberish. I showed the librarian some of the lines that read: *I’ll show them how they have hurt me they’ll see the pain spill out of me flowing crimson and it will stain them the stain will spread…*

“… yeah, these are pretty alarming writings.” The librarian flipped through and then squinted at the scribbled-out name on the cover. I’d already held it up to the light and tried to parse it but only the first letters, A and W, were legible. Ana? Anne? “… let me search the campus directory,” she said.

I thanked her and sat down at one of the tables to peruse the notes again, wondering—if the diary author hadn’t written them, who did?

A few moments later the librarian called, “Found her! Her name is Ava W.”

“Do you have a way to contact her?” I leapt up.

“No, unfortunately.”

“Why? Is it restricted inform—"

“Because Ava W. died ten years ago on October 5.”

\*\*\*

*Ten years ago…*

The librarian showed me an obituary. In the image was a solemn girl dressed in a black gown, staring into the camera like she wanted to drag down the entire world.

“But… if she’s dead, why would someone *else* leave this diary for me? And write all these notes?” I wondered.

This wasn’t how I expected all this to end. I figured, of course, that it was possible the diary’s author wrote it a long time ago. October 5 could have been in any year. And the diary itself was… well, it was worn. But I didn’t want it to be true. I’d thought, I’d hoped…

“She didn’t want to kill herself,” I said, more to myself than the librarian. “She wanted someone to care enough to stop her.” This was hitting me hard. I stared at the hollow eyes of the girl in the obituary. Ten years ago, Ava W. carried out her threats. If I’m being honest, part of the reason I didn’t try harder to look up the name, to find out who she is, was that…

I didn’t want to know. Not if it was this.

“I’m sorry,” the librarian told me as I took the diary back.

I retreated to my table. Looked again at that first page:

*I will always remember how none of them tried to stop me…*

I like to believe I would have tried. That if I’d met Ava then, if I’d been witness to her despair, I’d have tried to pull her out of it. Even at risk of being pulled under.

But there was no saving Ava. And as for the notes—I felt like I was back at square one. I had no clue who was writing them.

I supposed my best guess was someone who shared classes with me, given that’s where they tended to show up the most.

Idly scrolling the class rosters, I shook my head. None of these were people I could imagine wishing death to me. And who was the girl I kept glimpsing out of the corner of my eye, flitting through my periphery? A ghost? But I don’t really believe in ghosts—

Goosebumps blossomed along my arms, and I stiffened at the returning sense of being *watched.*

“Hey,” said the librarian.

I craned my neck, wondering where the feeling of eyes was coming from—

“HEY.”

I glanced up, because the librarian was now looming over me, brow scrunched.

"What?" I asked.

"What are you writing?"

Surprised, I glanced at my hand. I was holding a pen. Pressed hard into the paper under the tip were words in block capitals. I stared—just stared, and the first thought that popped into my head was, *Did the librarian do it?* But no, it was *my* hand holding the pen. And yet, I had no memory of writing these words. None at all. But there they were:

*CUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WO* — the rest of the last word, the "O" was partially drawn, my pen mid-circle.

Apparently, *I've* been writing the notes to myself.

\*\*\*

The librarian was staring at me like I was some sort of lunatic, but I didn’t even pay attention to her as I dumped out all my books and notebooks. I flipped through pages in a ferocious flurry until I found a textbook with the margin torn off the table of contents. I pawed through the ziploc of notes until I found one written on a torn scrap of a contents page. I held it to the textbook margin's tear.

It fit perfectly.

*All* the notes were ones that had been written on things near at hand to me, with whatever implement happened to be in reach at the time. And now that I was realizing where each note had been written, I found that I *remembered.* But it was all so hazy... like when you can't find your keys only to discover them in your pocket—or worse, in your hand, where you've been carrying them but have forgotten you're holding them. It was like that.

“Is this some kind of joke?” asked the librarian.

I didn’t stay to explain—just packed everything up. Fled because now that I’d caught my hand in the act, now that the memories were starting to come loose, I realized… realized that it must have been my own hand that slipped the diary into my bag. My own hand that snatched a kitchen knife before I went to bed, and held it to my throat while I was sleeping. And my own hand, too, that poured turpentine into my thermos while I was doing some art.

How do I tell police that I poured turpentine into my own thermos and held a knife to my own throat?

\*\*\*

I’ve read her diary cover to cover, and it makes me sadder every time. I wanted to try to save her. I wanted her to know that *someone* cared enough to try to save her. But I also can’t allow her to harm anyone else.

Who knows how many she’s taken in the years before I found her journal.

I can *see* her now. Ava, I mean. I see her at my periphery in that black gown. I get those goosebumps all up my arms when she takes my hand. The notes are in capital letters because capitals are easier to write with someone else’s hand—she’s been writing the notes *through* me, guiding my hand across the page. She doesn’t even hide from me anymore.

But no one else can see her.

I’ve burned the diary. Destroyed it so no one else will ever read it.

But she already has a grip on me. She hasn’t let go of my wrist since I burned the book. And I know I can’t save myself because I know what she will make this hand of mine do.

I’ve begged. I’ve pleaded. But no matter what I write, she replies *IT WAS TOO LATE FOR ME. ITS TOO LATE FOR YOU*

*YOU SAW ME DROWNING*

*YOU KEPT READING*

*OCT 5*
