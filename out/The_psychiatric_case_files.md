“Patient File #4289-A”
First-Person Narrative – Reconstructed from Memory

⸻

I wasn’t supposed to see the file.

It was left on the metal desk in the evaluation room—sloppy mistake for a place like this. These people are usually too careful. Too clinical. I don’t know why I looked. I shouldn’t have. But I did.

My name was on the folder, but not much else matched.

Birthday? Correct.
Blood type? Wrong.
Emergency contact? Blank.
And then: Diagnosis – Dissociative Fugue with secondary psychosis.
No release recommended.

That wasn’t a surprise. What came after was.

“Memory reconstruction failed.”
“Subject responds inconsistently to environmental stimuli.”
“Baseline scan deviates from all known human patterns.”

Human.

It didn’t say mental illness—it said non-human patterns. I read those words again, and something inside me went very still. I turned the page and saw a timestamp from my initial intake, followed by the words: “Found walking alone through Black Hollow State Forest. Naked. Covered in blood. None of it theirs. No memory of origin.”

I kept reading.

Session 3 Notes — Dr. H. Morrow

“Patient asked: ‘Do you remember when the sky changed?’
Further probing revealed no memory of childhood. Not suppressed—just missing. No affect. No grief.
Said: ‘I don’t think this is the version I came from.’”

Staff Report — April 2nd

“Patient observed knocking on sealed Room 12. Whispered: ‘They’re in there. They’re waiting for me to remember.’
Room 12 has been sealed since the 1993 incident. No staff member was instructed to inform the patient of that room’s existence.”

Internal Memo (Unauthenticated Author)

“Brain scan irregularities observed. Subject displays deep theta activity during waking hours. Multiple staff report ‘feelings of vertigo’ or ‘static in ears’ after prolonged interaction.”
“Do not assign same staff member two days in a row.”

I stopped reading when I found the photo.

It was paperclipped to the final page. Black and white. A grainy still of me, seated in the evaluation room. But in the mirror behind me—something was wrong. There was a second me, standing over my shoulder. Same face, different expression. Staring directly into the lens. Smiling.

I dropped the file. Staggered back. One of the orderlies came in and calmly picked it up. Didn’t say a word. Just smiled and walked out.

That night, everything changed.

When I looked in the mirror in my room, I saw the other version of me again. The smile stayed even when mine didn’t. I backed away, but the image moved closer. The lights flickered, and when they came back—there was a handprint on the glass. From the inside.

I haven’t slept since.

This morning, I asked Nurse Carter if she knew who I really was. She didn’t answer. Just tilted her head and said, “You’re not the one who was admitted, are you?”

She walked out, left the door open a little too long.

I checked the digital registry on the nurse’s station computer during meal rounds. My file—#4289-A—was still there. But beneath it, a new one had appeared:

#4289-B
No photo. No data.
Just a single note:

“He remembers now.”
