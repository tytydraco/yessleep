I have been scared to share my story, because I thought no one would believe me. I thought I was going to be labeled crazy or conspiracy theorist. But guys, something is wrong here!!! I started using bluetooth headphones when they came onto the scene like everyone did. However, I have noticed something very strange. When I leave them plugged in or out of their case I can hear this humming and buzzing that does not stop. Not just random electrical noises, but persistent humming and odd noises playing even when I do not have music coming through. Then, things started to feel very off. I felt light headed, dizzy, and like I was hearing voices. This led me to ask others about it. I asked my roommate to try them on but she did not hear anything. I figured I had just spent too many hours online and staring at screens. My roommate mocked me and decided she would get a pair and use them to my dismay and warning. BUT GUYS, after about a month or so she said she was feeling weird and hearing things too. Static noise, voices, whatever you may call it. Does anyone have any experience like this? Check out the weird video ad I found for them from a few years back. http://static-website-gg.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Are my bluetooth headphones poisoning/ possessing me?

I AM NOT CRAZY!  I now have 2 other people telling me they have had weird experiences with bluetooth headphones. Others say they heard strange noises/ voices coming from their headphones and endured terrible headaches. Is this a case of shitty tech, radiation, or even possibly ghosts?? Please someone help me out. I can’t be the one person who has ever experienced anything weird with bluetooth headphones. I am getting more scared and feel like maybe I should just throw them away. But I also feel like I NEED to figure out what is going on!!

Next month:

Checking back in/ update: While I know I should have stopped using them, I just can’t. It started with curiosity but now I feel like I cannot let go until I know the truth. And now I have noticed my headaches have gotten worse and tend to come after I stop wearing them. The voices also make me continue listening to hear what is happening. I feel like I am gradually becoming more obsessed with these headphones than the music they function to play. I feel dizzy when I do not wear them and scared, I am 50% sure I am being haunted but the other half of me feels like this is a giant scheme from mega corporations to keep us glued to our tech. I feel like I am going crazy which is just made worse walking around seeing everyone else tuned into their headphones. I feel like no one looks or talks on the street anymore with their headphones in. Is it the loneliness driving me insane or is it the headphones slowly taking my sanity?
