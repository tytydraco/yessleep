My father disappeared when I was young. It was the great tragedy of my childhood, the sort of news that spread like a disease through the small town where I lived. There was more than one teacher who stuttered to a halt on my last name and looked at me with their eyes overflowing with sympathy, or pulled me aside to tell me how good of a man he had been. 

I’m not certain exactly how old I was, because my mother refused to speak of him at all unless she was drunk to hell and back, and even then her words barely made sense. I was small enough, though, that the only thing I remember of him is the warmth of his voice and a slice of a smile. 

We had lived in a mansion of a house, bought partly by my father’s salary as a professor, but mostly by my mother’s trust fund. My parents had been planning on filling it up with a whole host of children, but with just my mother and I, all that empty space was terrifying. I had nightmares as a teenager about walking into the abandoned corridors of my house and never finding my way back to the small pocket of rooms that we maintained as a living space. 

My father was a professor of architecture at a prestigious university, the sort of school that everyone recognizes by name, and he drove an hour to work every day and an hour home. My mother and his friends tried to convince him to move to the city, but he said that he preferred the slowness and solitude of a more rural lifestyle.

He was kind to fault, and always ready with a joke. In a crisis, he always knew what to do. I know this because in the years after his disappearance, I would regularly get accosted by strangers and held captive while they told me long-winded stories about him.

I left as soon as I could, at seventeen years old, and I didn’t go back for two decades. But my mother died last month of a heart attack, and as their only child, the duty fell to me to clear out the house. 

My mother had forbidden me from going into his office. She kept it intact, sealed, like a shrine to him.  Out of some sort of morbid respect, I left it for last. 

The light didn’t work, so I opened the curtains covering the floor-to-ceiling window on one wall, coughing at the explosion of dust, and worked by the light of the sun. There was so much of him in that room, in the way that he decorated and the neat, loopy annotations filling many of his books. His desk was an oak behemoth, the weight of it wearing holes into the carpet, so I didn’t want to deal with it until the smaller items had been packed up. 

When I finally got around to the desk, I was surprised to find that the drawers were mostly empty. The only thing inside them was a stack of letters, shoved off in a corner. They were addressed to Caleb Hawthorn, my father’s closest friend and a fellow professor of architecture at a different college. According to one of my neighbors, an older woman who couldn’t shut up to save her life, my father had enjoyed the charm of written communication, even though he and everyone that he knew had easy access to phones. The paper was yellowed with age, and felt brittle when I picked it up. I have transcribed their contents below. The letters appear to have been sent back to my father after arriving at their destination.

Dear Caleb,

I must admit, it is a surprise to hear from you so soon. I assumed that you would be kept busy by your new son for the next couple of months at least. I remember the days of having a newborn, and I truly do not miss it. Still, I wish the best to you and your wife, and hope that the sleep deprivation has not yet stolen your wits. When we last spoke, your neurons were already struggling; I would hate for you to lose the remaining few. As always, please remember that if you need me, I can be there within a day. 

Once you have settled in, my family and I would love to come see you. My son had been asking after his uncle Caleb. We could plan for Christmas, perhaps? 

As to your enquiries about my happiness at my university, rest assured that I am very pleased with my current job, and if you wish to claim me for your own architectural department, you will have to try much harder than that. 

There is something that I would like to get your advice on, however. It concerns one student by the name of James Bellsmith. He is, by far, one of the most promising students that I have encountered, and although this is the first year that I have taught him, my colleagues have only spoken positively about him. As you know, my class is mostly focused on practical design. My students apply the concepts they have learned in other classes and make blueprints for buildings that are both structurally sound and visually interesting. 

It’s bad form for a professor to show favoritism, of course, but I was excited to review Mr. Bellsmith’s first project. I had heard so much about his capabilities and seen his intellect firsthand, in the thoughtful responses that he gave to my questions, even if he was a bit spacey. He turned in his blueprint very early, barely three weeks after I first explained the assignment. It was the first to end up on my desk, and although I usually wait for all of the projects to be turned in and grade them all at once, I didn’t want to wait. 

He’d turned in a blueprint for an observatory. It was an unusual choice for a first project, but on first glance, he seemed to have done exceptional work. It was mostly of one vast room, with a recessed space for an impressive telescope and a domed roof that could open or close easily. A ring of smaller rooms arced around the circular walls, and Mr. Bellsmith indicated that they would be used to give presentations, contain various informational artifacts and books about space, and store smaller telescopes. He provided detailed information about the mechanism that would open the roof, as well as the stained glass windows that would be in each of the outer rooms. 

Have you ever seen those illusion pictures made up of dozens of circular lines that make it look like the image is moving? I was obsessed with those as a kid, and I had a couple books full of them. I thought it was magic, and nothing could convince me otherwise, even when my mother took my book and tore it in half to show me that it really was just paper. 

Mr. Bellsmith’s blueprint reminded me of that. The more I looked at it, the more I became convinced that it was wriggling on the page, like maggots caught on a fish hook, the lines squirming ever-so-slightly out of place. The dimensions looked off. I checked over his math twice, and it was factually correct, but I couldn’t shake the impression that the observatory was somehow too large for itself. It physically hurt to look at; it made my eyes ache and my head pulse with pain. I know that doesn’t make any sense, I know how I sound. When I told my wife about it, she put her hand on my forehead and asked if I was feeling unwell. 

I called him into my office to discuss his project, once I’d had time to calm down. He was smirking the whole time that I talked, sunk into his chair without a care in the world. I put the blueprint down in front of him and demanded answers, with probably not as much professionalism as I should have employed. He looked down at it in confusion. He asked me what the hell I was talking about. 

There was no remaining sign of the unsettling creation that it had been before. It was just a regular, if very technically proficient, diagram. But I swear to you, Caleb, that observatory was straining at the seams of its blueprint, bloating in the way of dead animals filled with gas. I am asking you, please, to pay heed to our long friendship and trust me when I say that there was something truly wrong.

Dear Caleb,

Alright, I get it, you don’t believe me. You didn’t have to be so cruel about it. The president of my university agrees with you, by the way. He got all pitying and asked if I needed a vacation. I took it, obviously, because I’m not going to turn down free time off and my students didn’t really need me for the next few weeks. They’ve been working on their next project, and I’m hoping that Bellsmith will settle down without me there to terrorize. 

Have you ever had a student that hates you? I don’t mean they dislike your teaching style, or think you give too much work, or don’t like how stern you can be. I mean they really hate you. They want you to be dead, and they would do it themselves if they could. You wake up in the middle of the night to a sound coming from down the stairs and you’re frozen with the fear that they’ve finally come for you, and even your wife, sleeping peacefully beside you, isn’t safe. 

I think Bellsmith hates me like that. Sometimes when he looks like me, there is so much fury in his eyes that it seems like he would burn the whole country down if it meant that I went with it. My wife thinks that I’m being ridiculous. Maybe I am. I don’t know anymore. 

He’s turned in two more blueprints. They didn’t have the same horrible quality that the first did, but they were both labyrinthine, with twisting corridors and dead ends that seemed to just appear. Both were designed to be huge, sprawling structures, one for a library, and the other for a towering apartment building. They went against every principle of good architecture. They would be counterintuitive to navigate at best and downright dangerous at worst, leaving someone to wander for hours without seeing any hint of an exit. The safety and building codes would be a nightmare, and I doubt that they would ever be approved to actually be built. Parts of the buildings stuck out at odd angles, hanging far out over the rest. They would probably come crashing down at the first hint of wind. 

The worst part is that they were still beautiful, despite all of that. There was something undeniably compelling about them. 

I’ve been dreaming about his blueprints. I’m in his buildings every night, in a different area every time, and I’m running. There’s no transition between being awake and being asleep for me. I’m in my bed and then I’m sprinting at full speed down a hallway, like I’ve been dropped into a run that has already been happening for a very long time. I race through the labyrinth and it never ends, there’s always more ground beneath my feet and new places to go. There’s something chasing me, always just a couple steps behind. I can hear its claws scratching against the stone and hear the wheeze of its breath. Sometimes it gets so close that I can feel its cold teeth graze my back. 

I don’t think I can do this anymore, Caleb. Is that spot at your university still open? 

**January 23rd, 1995**

You bastard. You utter fucking bastard. I am not fucking delusional and if you try to take my son away from me, I will make you regret it. 

I run the mazes while I’m awake, now. I’ll blink and suddenly I’ll be inside one of the blueprints, with the monster inches behind. When it scratches me, I bleed, and I keep bleeding once the labyrinth fades away and I’m back at home. 

I know Bellsmith’s address. It’s quite simple to get from the university database when you know what you’re doing. He lives alone, which makes this easier. I’ve got my gloves, my old rifle, and a mask to cover my face. 

This is an awful thing to admit to you, and I’m sorry for that. But I need you to know. If this goes poorly, I need you to make sure that my son is okay. Tell him that I love him. 

It comes down to this: I cannot allow Bellsmith to build any of his blueprints. I have seen past his smile and he is empty inside.
