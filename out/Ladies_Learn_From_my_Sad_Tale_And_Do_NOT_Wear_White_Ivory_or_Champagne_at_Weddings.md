However, I will say that the dress I had chosen for my brother Richard’s wedding was none of these colours, rather a very delicate lemony-yellow crystalline shade, quite unusual, and one which “clashed gloriously” as they say, with my vibrant waterfall of naturally scarlet hair, and cast a golden sheen on my pale skin.

Not that that little bossy tart (don’t worry, she’s not on Reddit) who has hooked her gleaming fake talons into poor Richard would know anything about the aesthetics of colour analysis.

And although I will maintain till my dying day that the crystal-yellow was not “White, Ivory, or Champagne”, I will embrace the fact that Richard’s wedding meant a great deal to me.

Weddings are for brides- NOT! Weddings are for the social aspect – a wonderful party for guests to look fabulous and dance and chatter and judge and eat and drink. If Boss-Tart wanted a nice private intimate wedding, then that’s what she would have had. You can’t have your (wedding) cake and eat it too! You can’t invite two hundred people to pose for your photos and then micromanage their dress and expect them to fall in line and get upset when they don’t!

I will say, the main problem wasn’t even Boss-Tart, it was her godawful gang of bridesmaids. Those hell-hounds who started the original fight and subsequent venomous bitching which led me to step down from being a bridesmaid. That happened – oh- at least a year ago, after I quickly realised I am cut from a different cloth than Boss-Tart and her gang, and I need, if only for my own mental health and sanity, to step back. DM me if you want the details- I have the receipts- I kept all the texts, and you can see literally none of it was my fault.  

Richard also came and pleaded with me, and of course I can never refuse him anything. He looked so sad. I don’t blame him, by the way, for any of this, what happened then, and what happened now. Men are just- well, men. You know.

Anyway, fast forward to the wedding day. Ever since exiled from the hell-hound, sorry, bridesmaid group, I reserved the right to keep my own dress and appearance private, even though Boss-Tart had the audacity, after everything that happened, to text me and ask to see what I planning to wear. As if!

Even though my therapist said it wasn’t a terrible idea, and might be a way to mend bridges (or fences?) before the wedding, I politely declined. I’m quite proud of the text I composed to Boss-Tart in response- sharp, brief, to the point, honest and from the heart. Pearls before swine.

Finally, the big day arrived. 

I look, well, just drop-dead gorgeous. I mean, let’s be honest, that's the real problem. Boss-Tart and the hellhounds simply fade when I am around. You can see it happening in real time. I have no doubt if they could have hired a hitman to kidnap me and keep me out of the way for the wedding, they would have.

As it was, they did the next best thing.

I roll up to the wedding venue by myself, obviously eschewing a plus one, glittering in my crystal-yellow dress.

Boss-Tart, who literally looks like every single bride you can ever imagine wearing that same exact dress and hair that every single bride has ever worn, shoots daggers with her falsely-eye-lashed eyes at me. An audible gasp goes up, not, I will acknowledge, just from the hellhound group.

Poor mother comes up to me, and lays a hand on my bare arm. “Darling- so pale! Are you sure? Do you want to change-”

A fierce shushing thankfully cuts her short.

The ceremony over, the party gets started.

I make my way to the restrooms for a touch up before joining the party.

And in the hallway leading out of the main hall, they swarm me.

I barely have time to feel afraid. Five dumpy angry harpies dressed in tight black satin which literally photographed like garbage bin bags grab my limbs and push me to the floor.

“What the hell- let me go-” I don’t struggle - too worried about ripping the delicate fabric of my dress. And they are gripping me too tight. I only later see the purple bruises their thick fingers left on my pale skin.

“Bitch!” spat the lead – I honestly forget their names, they are so forgettable- I want to say Sophiya?

I catch a gleam of metal and suddenly the fear hits me, like an actual blow. Their poisonous faces twist over me. Are they actually going to hurt me?

“No”- I cry as Sophiya leans forward with a small pair of sharp nail scissors.

Hands grip my head. “Hold still!” she mutters.

Pain shoots through my neck- my ears. My ears. She nicked both earlobes.

They drop me and vanish from the hall. The whole ordeal took barely ten seconds.

I lay winded on the floor, feeling the blood gushing from my ears, crawling down my neck and onto my dress.

After a few seconds, I get up. A kindly auntie seeking the restroom spots me struggling to my feet. “Oh my dear- did you fall, you hurt yourself! Are you ok? Your dress!” she gasps.

“I’m ok” I say.

She follows me to the restroom, and holds tissue to my ears. But it is too late. The blood is already coagulating on my dress, large glistening patches. I stare at myself, my hair dishevelled, the blood in rivulets down my neck. Aunt hovers.

“What happened?” she asked.

I shook my head, and knowing better than to press, she pursed her lips.  

“Let me help wipe the blood off you.”

She was always one of my favourite aunts.

Other women came in, and gave a hand. Nobody asked anything else. One of the guests undid my updo, and arranged my hair artfully around my face, covering my torn ears. My skin was clean in a matter of minutes, but my dress, of course, was a mess.  

Aunt offered to take me home and help me for a quick change- but that wasn’t even an option for me.

The splashes of blood looked like rusty-scarlet abstract flowers, on the bodice and down the dress. “I’m keeping this on” I said.

The women exchanged looks and murmured things, and I went back to the party hall.

I danced my feet sore. When the night was over, I politely thanked the broom- my portmanteau for bride and groom, and went home.

I give them five months.
