God do i wish i could go back. Back to that god forsaken day on the internet. I hate the internet. I blame the internet. If it wasnt for this unfiltered online space i would never have had access to such horrid and cryptic damnation. The zespool of collectiove human knowledge is a cruel fate for unsuspecting people, who merely seek to be included. You surf the web to be connected, rarely do you think of being connected to despicable creatures who dabble in practices outside of your natural climate. Humans that are so disconnected from reality that their only smile comes from the most esoteric nonsense that only has weight from creeps dwelling on its subject. If people touched more grass, or had more hobbies, none of these things would even be discovered. They would get buried in the millions upon millions of thoughts and creative, positive ideas the human race is capable of creating. Yet at some point you have to look at the underbelly... The disgusting facts of life that can easily be ignored if your scared enough. easily ignored if you have the wherewithall to recognize it, and the boundries to openly reject it.   
  
Not me, i love the esoteric, or at least i used to.  I was the casual creepypasta reader, the usual scary story enjoyer, i even wrote a few myself. I mean lets be for real, who didnt get interested by slenderman, who hasnt fallen down the rabbithole of SCP, or how to summon bloody mary at 3AM. I eat those things up, they bring me comfort, maybe not in the traditional way,  but they release me from the trials and tribulations of everyday life. I really got into it when i was younger, now im an adult with responsibilities, with goals and aspirations. Yet when its time to wind down for bed, i hop on youtube or the web and revert to my younger self. I listen to reddit horror, youtube ARGS, all of the fun weird stuff ive always loved. As an adult life gets harder, ive found myself escaping into these fantasies of the ethereal. the idea of something beyond the droning grind of everyday life comforts me somehow.  But as i write this post, it seems ive dug too deep, grown too interested, too consumed. If that werent true, i wouldnt have stumbled across this acursed ritual, game, challenge, whatever the living fuck you want to call it. I never would have bought these black candles.  
  
I am quite sure the reader has no idea what im refering to, because as im writing this ive only seen 15 active users on this dark webpage. Yes, i was heavily exploring the stupid dark web, fuck you mudahar.  I wont blame anyone influencing me to explore the dark web, but how else woulsd i stumble upon some garbage like "the sunset ritual". How did this become my hell? I'm nothing but bitter as i write this, because i am nothing but dead. All consumed, a mere statistic, a protagonist to a scary story for some mediocre youtuber. Part of me is happy my life can be a part of the dead internet, i mean why not? If there is no way out for me, and no reasonable options, why not write my experience out for sniveling children to hopefully scare them off from copying what ive done. Im not dumb, i know there will be copycats, to that i say knock yourself out.   
  
So of course ill talk about how it started, I would really like to preface this with saying it could happen to anyone. I mean really i dont think i was too far in the deep end, compared to these satanists and bronies, not even the sadistic fucks on 4chan. I was on the dark web so im not innocent, i downloaded a browser that could get me there and started looking into random websites. Right off the bat i had a simple criteria, real documented paranormal events/ occurances. After a while of dibbok box bullshit and fake redrooms, i stumbled across a website, different in appearance to all the rest. It wasnt an advertisement to steal my identity or sell me black tar heroin, it was a simple website called "ritualofthesunset.com"  
As i scrolled up and down this plain website, it became clear that it was an all black screen, dedicated to one paragraph, a step by step guide on how to summon something called the "God of the sunset." This is all i really feel like typing right now because I havent slept in days. Im gonna go fuck off and try to stay awake, as ive become pretty good at it, but if you want to hear wht i have to say just stay tuned, ill post more in the upcoming days because i really cant stay awake much longer.
