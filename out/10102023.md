I had ju**s**t settled in t**o** watch a movie when the intercom rang, jolting me from my relaxation. I pau**s**ed the f**i**l**m** and made my way to the door, expecting to find a delivery per**s**on who had dialed **t**he wrong apartment n**u**mber.  
  
But when I rea**c**hed the intercom, the call had already ended, leaving me with nothing but the faint buzz of silence. I peered through the small window, scanning the hallway outside, but there was no one to be seen. Shrugging it off as a simple mista**k**e, **I** retur**n**ed **t**o my movie.  
  
Minutes later, a sense of appre**he**n**s**ion **cre**pt ov**e**r me. Somethi**n**g about that brief encounter nagged at the edges of my consciousness. With a growing curiosity, I approached the door again, this time lingering by the peephole.  
  
As **I** watche**d**, the elevat**o**r i**n**dica**t**or blinked to life, signaling its ascent. It paused momentarily on each floor before continuing upwards, and I could hear each time the doors opening, somebody **wa**lki**n**g in and ou**t**, and **t**hen the do**o**rs closing.  
  
Finally, the elevator **d**oors sl**i**d open, r**e**vealing... nothing. The empty interior of our small and cramped elevator made the carpeted floor of the building look like a huge pool of blood. The movement that I had previously heard from the elevator had all vanished. But I kept staring. As I continued to stare, a shiver ran down my spine. Although there was nothing out there for me to be scared of, all of my senses were sending big flashy warning signs. It was as if I was staring at the void and the void was staring back.  
  
Many days have passed since then, yet the strange occurrences persisted. One day, when I was coming home from work, I realised that I had left my keys in the car, so I went down to the parking lot to get them. My car wasn’t where I left it, instead it was, doors wide open, left in the middle of the aisle, motor and radio still on. Which is weird, as I don’t like to listen to the radio. When I got in to grab my keys, I also found some pills scattered around the ground, so I cleaned up my car a bit before leaving it in my spot.  
  
I finally decided to look online for help as it seems that these instances where something weird happens have gotten more and more invasive and common, since just this morning, when I woke up, I was lying in front of the elevator, and I could see that something was knocking on my door, I just couldn’t see what it was, so I ran away, as fast as I could, with a sense of impending doom towering over me, getting bigger by the minute. And now as I’m writing this from the local library I can see that the lady who’s in charge of monitoring the computers is walking towards me, but it’s like she glitches because now I can’t see her face anymore and her walk is weird.   
  
I hope this uploads in proper time.
