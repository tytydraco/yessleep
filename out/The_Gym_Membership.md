Even with cheeks full of acne and metal braces covering my teeth, I still mustered up the courage to tell my high school crush that I liked her. I let go of all doubts and anxieties and took the plunge into the unknown. It was all worth it because Suzie smiled.


Then I asked her if she liked me.


Suzie frowned, then she laughed in my face. “What? Oh my God, no. I don’t like you at all. You’re too skinny.”


It has been fifteen years since I graduated high school but that memory has been embedded in my brain ever since. It made me feel overwhelmingly self-conscious for the first time in my life and pushed me to always consider what other people thought of me. If Suzie thought this about me, did everyone else? Was I too skinny? Was my body a problem? What about my hair? My clothes? My personality?


Instead of wallowing in self pity, I decided to do something about it - to change how people perceived me. After a few Google searches on the best ways to add weight to my body, I found an answer that changed my life.


Weightlifting.


I found a gym and started going there on Saturday mornings, which eventually led me to going every day after school. Within four months, I saw improvements to my body every time I looked in the mirror. I was hooked. 


My frame had filled out nicely by the time I was in my twenties. I was a dedicated gym rat and felt pride that I was changing my body for the better. I wouldn’t have won any bodybuilding competitions but that was never my goal. My goal has always been to push myself with maximum effort and strive for the best body I can get without steroids or demanding diet restrictions. 


Spending so much time at the gym had other perks. I met some of my best friends there and got a few dates as well. I loved the gym. It was my temple. 


Then everything changed in my thirties when I was forced to relocate for work. The small town I moved to didn’t have a gym and my apartment was way too small to accommodate home workout equipment. I tried to keep in shape by running but that routine didn’t last long. It was too solitary. Too rote and dull. I wanted to feel the burn of my muscles as I set a new personal best in the bench press or feel the delayed muscle soreness two days after a squat session. I wanted to feel the pump in my muscles like I did in my twenties.


It’s not difficult to understand my joy when I learned that a gym was opening soon right down the street from my new apartment. It was in a little strip mall, sitting between a boutique and a mom-and-pop hardware store. I was so excited that I joined the gym on the opening day. My membership dues were cheap but the equipment was nice. I got back into the habit of lifting weights and my happiness knew no bounds.


I’d found my temple again.


However, not everything was perfect. The owner of the gym, Baker, was the strangest man I’d ever met. The day I agreed to become a member, he didn’t offer me a tour of the place or comment on the types of equipment he provided. All he did was question me on the women I knew and if they’d be interested in joining the gym. To be honest, Baker didn’t seem to know anything about gyms or exercise. He stared at me stupidly when I asked if he had battle ropes or weight belts. 


His lack of expertise shouldn’t have come as a shock to me. It should have been apparent by his physical features. He was of average height but I doubt he weighed more than one hundred pounds. The guy was skinny - emaciated skinny - and much thinner than I’d ever been. A swift wind could blow him over. Baker had never even attempted to use the workout machines he was offering to customers.


Still, it would take more than one weird guy to prevent me from fulfilling my daily workout schedule. I went every day after work and on Saturday mornings. My habit was back and I loved every second of it.


Then the women started to join and I loved every second of that too.


Everytime I would work out, I was surrounded by dozens of women. Young, beautiful women, wearing skin-tight leggings and athletic wear that showed off their curvy frames. There would be times when the gym would have three or four guys but thirty women. I wasn’t a creep or anything. I didn’t hit on the women and only spoke to them if they spoke to me first, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel a little self-conscious about being one of only a few guys in a gym filled with women. It seemed that no matter where I looked I was engaging in some kind of faux-pas that might piss off one of the female gym members.


Over the next month my alarm bells started going off when I noticed the lack of men in the gym. It had been weeks since I’d seen another guy there except for Baker. I assumed that Baker was terminating the male’s memberships and only catering to women out of some kind of creepy intention. I didn’t like it.


Then Baker started calling the female gym members into his office at random. I was doing arm curls when Baker approached a tall silver-haired woman and told her they needed to discuss something about her membership. Off to Baker’s office they went and he closed the door behind them.


A few days later I was stretching out my hamstrings when Baker told a curly-haired woman with a pink Fitbit that he needed her to help him move a new desk in his office. She was a little hesitant but eventually obliged when he offered her a three-month free gym membership coupon.


I may be old-fashioned, but isn’t moving heavy furniture something you’d normally ask a guy to help with?


The following week, Baker angrily told a woman with a diamond cross necklace to meet him in his office because she’d broken gym rules and they needed to discuss her error. It seemed that no one cared about this strange behavior except for me. All the women in the gym kept walking on their treadmills or lifting free weights, blocking out the environment with the AirPods in their ears. 


It wasn’t like I could do anything - it’s not illegal to have a conversation - but the ordeal aroused my suspicions. After the pair were in his office for half an hour, I knocked on the office door. I wanted to make sure the woman was okay - that Baker wasn’t taking financial advantage of her by forcing her to sign a shitty membership document or something.


Baker opened the door and smiled his weasley little smile. “Can I help you?”


“Uh, yeah,” I said, peering into the office. “The bathroom needs more paper towels.”


“I’ll get that sorted out. Thanks for letting me know.”


He went to close the door but I propped it open and said, “Oh, I thought someone else was in here.”


I scanned the small office again but found that my eyes had in fact not deceived me. Baker was the only one in his office. The woman with a diamond cross necklace was gone.


“I thought I saw a woman come in here,” I reiterated. “You had to talk with her about something.”


Baker turned around and looked at his office. There was a small desk with a computer on it, the screen black. Two old worn chairs. A fake potted plant in one corner covered in dust. In the center was a brand new rug.


Baker turned back to me and gave me the worst fake laugh I’d ever heard. “Nope. Just me. I believe the woman to which you’re referring left earlier. You must have missed her exit.”


“Oh . . . right. Okay.” 


He winked at me. “Instead of working out your arms so much, maybe you should work out your eyes.”


His fake laugh came again while he closed the door in my face.


Was this a joke or did he really think people could “work out” their eyes?


***


The next day, I arrived at the gym to find a surprise. The woman with a diamond cross necklace was on the elliptical, going at a good pace and humming to some song blaring from her AirPods. I normally didn’t approach women at the gym but my curiosity got the best of me.


“Excuse me?”


She removed one ear bud and stopped using the machine. “Yes?”


“Weird question, I know, but what did Baker want when he brought you into his office yesterday?”


Her lips pinched together and she glanced at the ceiling. “Um . . . I’m sorry, but I think you’re confusing me with someone else. I’ve never been in his office.”


Before I could respond, Baker came around the corner and got our attention. He pointed to the woman beside me. “Ma’am, I need to see you in my office for a moment. There’s a problem with your paperwork.”


She looked at me and laughed. “Ha, what are the odds? I guess I’ll find out what’s behind curtain number one.”


I watched her follow Baker into his office and a sense of dread overcame me. She didn’t remember going into his office yesterday? I was positive it was her.


Something weird was going on and I had to figure it out.


I waited a few minutes before I put my ear to Baker’s closed office door. I could hear soft mumblings but I couldn’t make out any words. Soft rock music played from speakers on the walls of the gym so I used this noise to my advantage. I slowly twisted the knob and opened the door until I got a sliver of a view inside the office. I prayed the music would drown out any noise the door made.


With the door cracked I could make out their conversation. The words were soft but Baker was talking about a document, just like he’d said.


“Yes, this one here isn’t labelled correctly.” He slid a piece of paper across the table.


The woman put a hand on her head. “It looks correct to me.”


There came that stupid fake laugh again. “No, the subsection right here.”


He got out of his seat and went around to the side of the table where the woman sat. He put his arm around the back of her seat and pointed to the document. Rage boiled inside me. He was putting his arm around her in a way I didn’t like. I could see the woman getting uneasy.


“Look, Baker,” the woman said. “You’re making me a little uncomfortable.”


Baker turned to her then leaned down close to her ear. “Let me whisper something to you.”


The woman’s face twisted into a confused scowl. “Whisper? I don’t want you coming near-”


Baker mumbled something directly into her ear. I couldn’t hear specifics from my distance but the susurrations were strange. It didn’t sound at all like English words. Or any words to be honest. It sounded more like high-pitched clicks or a rattling noise. Even hearing the clicks from my range seemed to vibrate my core and made me feel nauseous, but I kept my eyes inside the room.


My mouth dropped when the woman’s arms immediately went limp and her head lolled to the side.


She was unconscious.


My hands made fists. My blood pressure spiked. My cheeks flushed. Rage like I’d never felt surged inside me knowing this fucking psycho was making women unconscious in his office. I don’t know how he did it, but that wasn’t the point. The point was the woman was now helpless.


“Stand up,” Baker demanded.


The woman lazily got to her feet, her head still loose on her neck. Baker flipped the large rug over. There, in the middle of his office floor, was a wooden trap door. He pulled open the door then demanded that the woman go down the steps. She did. Her gait was reminiscent of someone in a trance. She moved lethargically down the hidden steps inside the trap door and Baker followed before pulling the trap door shut.


“Oh, shit,” I whispered to myself. This had gone way past creepy. Now we were in serial killer territory.


I slipped into his office and inched the trap door open just enough so I could see inside. I found the woman and Baker in a small, crudely dug basement with a dirt floor.


Baker stood behind her and moved her hair to one side. Then he lifted his shirt up to his chin.


My legs grew tense. I was going to burst into the room and stop this weirdo right now. I was much bigger and stronger than Baker and I was about to give him a beating before I called the police. The asshole deserved it.


Then every muscle in my body froze from what I saw next.


A dark patch on his stomach began to move. It unhinged itself from Baker’s body and unfolded like the proboscis of an insect. A long thin tube extended from Baker’s belly toward the woman’s head then curled into a striking position. The tension was released and the tube’s sharp point shot out and stuck into the woman’s skull. I heard the meaty impact.


The translucent tube soon grew animated with material that was being sucked out of the woman’s head.


My body recoiled backwards. I couldn’t understand what or how this was happening. As much as I thought I was doing the right thing by defending this woman, I realized that I was a coward. I couldn’t help her. My lack of bodily control prevented me from bursting in to save her like I planned. My courage disappeared the moment I witnessed that Baker wasn’t . . . human.


I fled through the gym. Some of the women watched me with confused faces before I erupted through the front door and sprinted toward my car. I only made it halfway through the parking lot before I vomited.


I got home but everything felt numb. Nothing made sense. A shower didn’t help ease my mind. Neither did a meal or sleep. I lay in bed, unable to relax enough to get rest. I’d watched a woman get penetrated in the head and her brains sucked out but I was too much of a coward to help her. I’d let Baker win. I didn’t stop him.


Him?


It?


Whatever Baker was, he was good at pretending to be a weird little gym owner. Good at mimicking human behavior. I began to play back all the times that women had been inside his office. I began to piece together some semblance of what Baker was doing. 


He had some way to create a sound that when whispered in someone’s ear would make them senseless. Perhaps it only worked on women? Why? Do women process sounds differently than men? Or was he preying on women for some other purpose?


After his victim was unaware of her surroundings, Baker would use that tube attached to his body to feed from inside his victim’s skull. He didn’t kill his prey - that would cause too much attention - and the parasitic mechanism he used must create short term memory loss. That would explain why the women came back to the gym. Again and again. They never remembered the terror enacted upon them.


I always found it odd that Baker’s gym didn’t have cameras in the main workout areas, but now it made sense. He didn’t want his activities being recorded under any circumstances.


Whether Baker was human or not didn’t matter. I knew what he was. He was a predator. A parasite. And he had to be stopped before he took enough from a woman to kill her.


I jumped out of bed and put on some clothes. Then I headed to the gym.


I had to stop this.


***


It was two in the morning when I parked a quarter of a mile away from the gym and trekked behind trees and old buildings to stay out of sight. Although I brought it with me as a backup plan, I didn’t want to use my key card to gain entry into the gym, as each swipe is logged on his computer, so I was going to break in. I didn’t want him knowing what I was up to before I could find evidence against him, and my investigation might take multiple tries.


My hoodie did a good job of concealing my face so I wasn’t worried if someone saw me. It didn’t matter. I knew that as soon as I found evidence of his vile behavior I would have the police there in no time. Surely something incriminating had to be on his computer or in the hidden bunker under his office.


My plans were halted when I saw that the gym lights were on. I pressed up against an exterior wall and sneaked a look through the gym’s front windows. Only one person was inside. It was Baker.


And he was lifting weights.


He lay on the bench press, looking at the bar above him with curiosity. It was like he was trying to figure out why someone would do this workout. Why this particular exercise was beneficial to humans. Then he grabbed hold of the bar with both hands and tried to push the weight.


A smile took over my face when I realized that Baker was about to accidentally do major harm to his body.


He’d stacked the weightlifting bar with as much weight as it could fit. It was a completely naive choice to do such a thing. He’d fitted the bar with eight plates on each side. Each one weighed forty-five pounds. In addition to the bar itself weighing forty-five pounds, Baker was about to attempt to lift 765 pounds.


There are only a few humans in history that have achieved such a feat and all of them were unique outliers in peak human strength. Baker was rail thin and had a lack of muscle on his frame. The bar was going to be way too heavy for him and, once gravity took over, the weight was going to squash him like a bug.


I prepared my phone so I could call 911. This scene was about to get messy.


I almost dropped my phone when I looked up again. Baker had taken the bar down to his chest then pushed the weight up in a perfect bench press technique. Then he did it again. And again. His arms moved with ease as he continued this exercise over and over. Ten times. Then twenty. Then thirty. I was in complete disbelief.


My shock was warranted. Not only did this display how correct I was in Baker not being human, but it also gave evidence to something much more terrifying. Baker was much much stronger than any human.


And that meant much deadlier too.


Now my conscience was clear. Had I barged into his officer earlier and exposed his secret, he would have easily killed me - and maybe everyone else in the gym - to keep his secret safe. He was a menace, a parasite to the women of this small town, and I was the only one who knew what he truly was. Baker was a danger to all humans.


I had to kill him. Tonight.


***


I found a window cracked open in the back of the mom-and-pop hardware store next door. Opportunities like that should be taken advantage of so I wedged inside the store and began searching through the aisles. I needed weapons. Something to defend myself with and put an end to Baker’s terror.


A rake? No, not dangerous enough.


A shovel? Nope.


A screwdriver? No way. 


I stopped in aisle three when I found the axes.


***


I returned to my spot outside the gym windows and kept an eye out for Baker. He wasn’t lifting weights anymore but the door to his office was closed. It was a risk to sneak up on him but it was the only leverage I had. A surprise attack would be the most lethal.


Breaking in would be too loud, so I scanned my key card and the lock disengaged. I opened the front door as quietly as I could and padded between the workout machines until I stood outside Baker’s office. There was no music playing. It was completely silent.


Until I rapped my knuckles on the door.


“Yes?” Baker asked from inside. “Who is it?”


Instead of answering, I remained quiet and hoisted the axe over my shoulder.


I heard the rumbling of an office chair. Soft footballs. The soft squeak of a turning brass knob.


When Baker’s chest came into view I used every ounce of my strength to swing the heavy axe. The sharp head arced through the air and the impact into Baker’s chest should have put the gym owner down for good.


That’s not what happened.


The cutting edge of the axe slapped against Baker’s chest and bounced off like I’d swung into a steel wall. The recoil hurt my hands so badly that my weapon fell to the ground. Baker tripped backwards, catching himself on his desk. When he saw me his eyes narrowed.


Baker put a hand to his chest but there was no shock in his expression at what I’d just done. In fact, he looked a little amused. 


“What the fuck are you?” I asked, picking up the axe.


“What do you mean?”


“I saw what you’ve been doing, Baker. I’m not letting you hurt people anymore.”


“Hurt people? I’m just a gym owner.”


“What the hell is that thing on your stomach?”


He got his balance and as he stood I could see the slash the axe made in his shirt. Thick green slime leaked out. Baker didn’t seem phased by his wound because all he did was smile oddly and repeated that fake laugh I hated so much.


“The thing on my stomach?” He asked sarcastically. “You want to know what it is? Here, let me show you.”


In one quick movement he ripped his shirt off and the dark patch began to swirl. The proboscis stretched out, striking at me, but I lunged out of the way and almost collided with an exercise machine nearby. Baker calmly stepped out of his office but something was different.


His face was deformed.


“Do you think you’re the first human to discover what I am?” Baker asked, his voice very garbled and deep. “They all thought they could stop me too.”


It was then that I realized that my neck was craning up to look at Baker in the face. His legs had extended to extreme proportions. His arms were twice the length they should be. The skin around Baker’s head began to protrude and bubble from some kind of internal pressure.


Baker’s skin began to split. What was once a human arm was shed away to reveal a long insectoid foreleg. Tiny hairs covered the segmented appendage that ended in a pair of hook-shaped claws. Baker’s eyes lost focus while his mouth unhinged. His head split down the middle and what came out of the gory crevice was the head of a giant insect. Huge bulbous eyes watched me while antennas jerked and twisted to senses unknown to humans.


Baker’s jeans ripped from the transformation and the rest of his skin slipped off into a pile on the ground. A grotesque head with sharp mandibles sat atop a thorax that narrowed into a thick abdomen, all of his encased in a reddish black exoskeleton. Six legs brought Baker closer to me but by this time I had retreated back to a far wall, my stomach begging to relieve its contents.


Baker raised its upper body, similar to how a praying mantis stands, and the proboscis sticking out of his thorax curled in on itself. It was ready to strike. 


A foul stench saturated the air and Baker’s exoskeleton clicked and crunched against itself with every movement. I was utterly and deeply terrified for my life but I knew that if I didn’t stop him then he could continue his parasitic ways. I hefted my axe over my shoulder and prepared to swing.


There was a blur of movement when Baker came at me. A cackling hiss erupted from Baker as he lunged forward, his legs and proboscis groping for any part of my body it could grab. I swung my axe as hard as I could.


It made contact.


Baker fell back against the shelves of free weights, causing a thousand pounds of metal to fall on him. My hands were shaking from the pain of my axe swing but I gripped my weapon tightly and went in for the kill. I had to break through the exoskeleton if I wanted to kill Baker.


“Go back to whatever planet you came from,” I shouted and hoisted the axe above my head.


An excruciating pain ripped through my leg. The hooked claws of Baker’s leg had snatched me. With one tug, Baker sent me tumbling to the floor. My axe fell out of reach.


Baker crawled out from under the weights like they were nothing more than pillows. Before I had time to stand up, he was on top of me and pinned my arms and legs down. I screamed in pain at the incredible force. I could hear my arms and legs breaking from the pressure.


Those bulbous eyes got inches away from my face. Thick mandibles snapped together like they were promising future pain. Antennas dipped and skirted along my hair and forehead.


“Stop,” I screamed, tears running down my cheeks. “Why are you doing this?”


Baker’s mandibles stopped clicking together. His eyes caught and refracted the gym lights in strange ways.


“To survive,” Baker said, his voice now a resonant tone.


“Why can’t you leave?” I mumbled. “Go back to your home planet and live there?” 


“Stupid boy. Earth is my home planet . . . and I’ve been here much longer than primates.”


I screamed in pain again as Baker pushed his weight against me. I felt the tiny hairs along his body rub against my legs and torso. The proboscis uncurled itself and pointed straight at my head.


Baker leaned down. “Let me whisper in your ear.” 


I began to shout but a reverberating rattle emanated from between his mandibles and my mind withdrew within itself. A complete and utter calmness took over my faculties and suddenly I felt no fear. My body became instantly paralyzed before I blacked out.


***


When I regained consciousness, I was speechless when I opened my eyes to find the woman with a diamond cross necklace looming over me.


“Hey,” I whispered.


She smiled. “Hey. I found you in the gym and called an ambulance. You were in pretty bad shape. You’ve been in a medically induced coma for three days.”


I was in a hospital room. A nurse was examining a monitor. Three doctors were discussing something among themselves in the hallway and kept pointing to me.


The memories of that night came rushing back. My short term memory was intact. I’d been allowed to remember my fight with the thing that camouflaged itself as a gym owner. 


“Wh - wh - where’s Baker?”


She sighed, and her necklace shifted. “No one knows. The police have been trying to reach him but all of his documentation and identification records are fake. I can’t believe we were working out in a gym owned by such a creepy guy, right?”


“Yeah . . . right.”


The doctors came in and explained to me my diagnosis. Or, I should say, a lack of diagnosis. They told me that multiple bones in both arms and legs had been crushed and would need extensive surgery and physical therapy if I ever wanted to walk again. They said that a large amount of my marrow had been pulled from my bones and said that a head MRI revealed a portion of my brain had been . . . extracted.


They told me that they’d never seen anything like my injuries and asked how I received them. I lied, and told them I didn’t remember. They told me the authorities were trying to get answers from the gym owner named Baker but no one could locate him.


The doctor left when I began to weep. I knew Baker had sucked out something in my head. Was it a memory? Was it a motor skill? Was it my ability to understand social cues or do math? Combine that with the extensive surgeries I would need and my lack of bone marrow, I knew my chances of a full recovery were slim. I would never get to lift weights again. The gym - my temple - had been destroyed.


I wept like a baby, hot tears falling on my hospital bed sheets. I was a bawling mess and my chest heaved with each breath.


Then I felt the warm embrace of a hand on my cheek. It was the woman with a diamond cross necklace.


“Hey, you’ll get through this,” she said. “We can do it together.”


“Together?”


“Yeah. I’ll be here. I’ll help you.”


“Help me with what?”


She patted my head. “The transformation,” she said, then lifted my shirt.


On my stomach was a dark patch.
