I didn’t want to move to Hancock, Maine. After a month of living here, the birds suddenly fell from the sky in droves and the government blamed it on air pollution. I knew better. A few days after the first of a wave of erratic behaviour and unexplained phenomenon, we were contacted by Them. The Chosen humans interpreted Their messages and images, made them into something tangible, something more than disturbing pictures and indiscernible sounds that may have been language. Two days after They first made contact, They stopped. Globally, all governments hesitated on what to do and how to further communicate with Them. What they didn’t know was that They were still talking to us, but only a select few. My daughter and I were one of them. 

Francis and I lost her father Ryan after he took his life because of gambling debts he kept hidden until the guilt consumed him. He gambled away the mortgage payments he said we were making, the college fund we had been saving for Francis since she was a few months old, and fell massively into a debt our family still hasn’t recovered from. As a family of two, we started from rock bottom financially and had to support each other. I took a temporary teaching job at a college in Hancock, Maine, and Francis worked weekends and most nights after school to be able to afford our small apartment. In most months, it was enough and we were able to make it work. We lived our lives without Ryan and tried to rebuild as much as we could. In a little over a month, I felt the same hopelessness and depression I first felt when we got the news that we lost him to suicide, but this time it was our lives that were in danger. 

I was having nightmares for months before the First Contact, so I didn’t think of anything when my dreams started to become more realistic and nightmarish. I only noticed when my dreams started predicting things that would happen the next day. At first, I only saw a series of haphazardly put together images that I tried to shake off in the morning. The first night I saw images of a person transforming into a bird through my kitchen window, and the bird persistently tried to fly inside through the closed window. After a few violent attempts, its neck broke and it flailed around on the ground. When I went outside to inspect it, I saw dozens of birds with their necks broken in the yard. News reports flooded Maine that afternoon. All of the birds throughout the city were acting erratically and violently. They came down from the sky and attacked everything in sight, until they all stopped, as if all of their necks snapped simultaneously. It was said to be an air pollutant and every other species but the birds were said to have been immune. We were supposed to be safe. After my second night of nightmares, I knew better. 

The second night I dreamed of several world disasters — I saw images of floods in Metropolitan cities that wiped out hundreds of thousands of people. I saw distorted images of fires burning out all wildlife in forests and parks I’ve never seen before. I was a little girl trapped inside of our building elevator, and Someone was watching me, inviting me closer. I didn’t see Them yet, but I could feel Their eyes on me. I felt scared. Francis woke me up as They touched me in my dream, and my arm felt hot where they had grabbed onto me. Still quite young, it wasn’t uncommon for her to wake me up after a particularly bad nightmare. She told me through tears that she had a dream that she was trapped and alone in our building’s elevator, and she saw a strange thing reach out to her and grab her hard. I held her as she fell back asleep, but I was unable to sleep anymore that night. Within two days, Toronto, New York, and Detroit were flooded and evacuated. Half of the wildlife preserves in Canada and the United States were scorched, and like Maine, birds fell out of the sky worldwide like clockwork. There was mass panic, and all governments began to contact each other in earnest, putting aside all conflicts and working towards figuring out what was happening. 

On the fourth night, I knew. They visited hundreds of thousands of people overnight in their dreams, with some fanatics claiming that They were in contact for much longer. The nightmares broke some people mentally, and there was mass institutionalization for thousands. People claimed they had visions of bodily invasion, mass abduction, and foresaw even more devastating worldly disasters. No one believed them at first and thought their dreams were a symptom of mass hysteria. Francis and I decided not to share our contact in the fear of getting hospitalized and separated and so we spoke only to each other about our nightmares. On the fourth night, I dreamt of one of Them visiting me in my bedroom, producing images out of thin air of violent humans attacking each other, cult-like groups sacrificing each other, and children in faraway colonies that I couldn’t even begin to describe. Francis dreamt of being taken away in a few days to a place likewise impossible to describe. Just as the government was starting to, we trusted our dreams now. We were some of the Chosen, and we worked together sleeplessly until the sixth day to try to stop Francis from getting taken away like we both saw in our fractured dreams.

On the sixth day, it was as if tens of thousands of children and adults had suddenly vanished. Their beds undisturbed, their personal belongings untouched. Francis was one of them. I slept all day trying to force a vision from Them, but no amount of NyQuil or sleeping aids allowed me to contact Them during sleep. After a day of mass news reports of no contact from Them reported from everyone, we all thought that They were done now that They had taken some of us. I thought that like Ryan, I lost Francis forever. I drank myself to sleep that night, almost to the same oblivion I was sure I lost both of them to.

On the seventh night, I saw Their entire plan, from its inception to its end. They orchestrated every event from the past week, and meticulously selected the mentally healthiest, most durable, and fit children and adults. They came to visit me that night, and explained through images only I could make sense of that my husband’s death had affected me too much, that I wasn’t strong enough to see Their plan through or join Their future. Francis, still young and malleable, was thriving with Them, and I couldn’t detect any suffering or unhappiness on her face. It was as if Ryan and I never existed. I wanted to be hurt and angry at Them, but seeing her smile for the first time in almost a year, I felt at peace. After Ryan left, all I’ve ever wanted was to see her happy. As I was watching her smile and play with people like the carefree child she deserved to be, I missed the sirens in the background and the sound of the First Wave touching the Earth. As the first wave of bombs came rushing down, I was trying to memorize the smile on her face and the happiness lining the outer corners of her eyes. Millions of losses were felt worldwide simultaneously as I was reaching out to fix the lock of her hair that got misplaced while running around. 

It’s been some time since the Second Wave. I followed a group of survivors broadcasting a safe haven, promising safety and security, food and shelter. After the population there slowly dwindled, a group and I discovered that the survivors were being used as sacrifices for Them. We left and have been looking for a safe place for now, until the Third Wave hits. I’ve already had dreams of it but I haven’t shared it with the others. For a few nights now, I’ve dreamt that They were looking for us. They’ve never used words before to communicate, but I could feel their anger in my dreams every night as we successfully continued to evade them. But last night I dreamt that They found us. Suddenly, They were looking through my eyes at my group, and I almost felt giddy with anticipation while They were inside of me. 

If you’re reading this, it’s because you want to know what these last dreams meant, and how to survive the upcoming invasion. I wanted to say this: there is nothing to be afraid of. They have chosen our world for a special purpose, and the Chosen humans could help bring your salvation on Earth if you are willing to accept Them. Choose wisely. Choose Them.
