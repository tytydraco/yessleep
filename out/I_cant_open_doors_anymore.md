There's things that we do on a daily basis that are second nature for us. Driving, showering, waiting in line, even opening doors. We don’t give it a second thought, they are simple things, we repeat them over and over again throughout our lives. How many doors do you think the average human opens throughout their lifetime? A shit ton. 



This morning everything was normal. My day started the same. I woke up on my bed, got a fresh shower, and ate some quick breakfast. I left at the same time my roommate was just opening the door, so we walked together to the elevator. 



As I walked to my office I felt odd, there was sun but I couldn’t feel the heat. Actually my skin has been pretty pale ever since I woke up. A kid was running around and he fell in front of me, so I reached out to help him. He was 4-5 years old but he was heavy just like a football player. It took me a while to pull him up. 

“I’m so sorry he loves to run around like that. Honey I told you to stay close”  His mom said while struggling to grab her kid.



“No worries I used to do the same when I was little” I whispered while catching my breath from pulling him up. I whispered????? My voice was completely gone.   
  


The lady just smiled and slowly walked away with her kid, I kept walking.



I arrived at my office building, the entrance has two huge glass doors. I grabbed one of the handles and pulled. The door did not move, I felt an immense pressure coming from the other side of the door.



“What the fuck is going on” I thought to myself as I kept pulling the door. 



I stepped back and took a big breath. I placed both hands on the handle and pulled with all my strength my back straightened, I started to sweat. I felt as If I was at the gym doing a back row with some heavy weights. As I was pulling, my hands started to slip until they snapped off the handle. I got knocked back by the force and bumped with someone behind me. 



“Chris, are you okay man. What is going on?” Mike (my manager) said while holding me up. 



“I…. I don't ...I don’t feel so good” I whispered barely while recovering my breath. 



Mike couldn’t understand what I was saying. He held me up and opened the door for me. He sat me on a couch. “I will be right back please stay here, whatever you do don’t leave the building” he said as he reached for his phone.



He dialed someone and while he was leaving  I could make out the following words in his conversation: “... It happened…blue eyes….chris”. 



The couch felt safe, I could not move for hours. I was just laying there watching. Something interesting happened: the room started to get dimmer. It was 10 am but my eyes saw darkness. The reception hall was dark with the lightbulbs barely making enough light for me to see the room.



I am still sitting on this couch waiting for Mike to come back, it has been a couple of hours but I cannot move.  People come and go but they don’t seem to mind me, except for the blue eyed ones. As they enter the building I can feel their eyesight on my skin, they look just like us but their eyes are blue not just the iris but their cornea as well. In the dim room their eyes look like beacons. 



I am waiting for Mike… I hope he can help me understand what is happening to me.
