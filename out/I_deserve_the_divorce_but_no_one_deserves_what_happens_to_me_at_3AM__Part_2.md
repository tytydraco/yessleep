My name is Evan, and every night at 3AM, a monster loosed by my ex-wife pays me a visit. 

Since I shared the beginning of my ordeal last week, I’ve gotten a lot of questions, and even some helpful suggestions for getting out of my predicament. I’ve started trying to learn as much about what’s happening to me as possible, in the limited hours I have.

Since my first update, I’ve learned two critical pieces of information. First: he can’t take my time while I’m looking at him.

Last Thursday night — or I guess early Friday morning — I woke to the familiar pale face at the foot of my bed, staring and waiting for me to blink so it could steal my hours. Then a thought occurred to me: what if I didn’t blink?

I stared at the ghoulish intruder until my eyes began to water. Then I began alternating, shutting and reopening one eye at a time. The expression on G’s face went from curiosity to anger. He scowled, eyes widening into black pools. The shadows in the dark corners of my room grew, and spread. Soon the only thing I could see beyond my bed was that hideous, sneering face.

The creature clamped its cold, fibrous hands around my throat and squeezed. I reached up to try and pry the fingers away from my skin, only to find myself grasping at air. 

“Sleep,” commanded a distorted, primal voice from the back of my mind. Before I shut my eyes, I stole a glance at my alarm clock. 3:03. I’d managed to stall G for a few full minutes.

I woke to the buzzing of my alarm, and a painful feeling in my throat. I went to splash some cold water on my face, and found angry blueish bruising already starting to appear on my neck. “Ow!” The skin felt tender to the touch

There goes my nightmare theory.

Second, and perhaps more importantly: I’ve  also learned what actually happens to me during the missing hours—at least from the outside perspective. I thought I was scared to sleep before. Now I’m petrified. 

Scared the shit out of my friend Jacob, too.

His flight back home was canceled, forcing him to rebook from Friday night to Saturday afternoon. I offered to feed his dogs, spend the night and keep an eye on the place. Deal was a win-win-win for me: helping a friend; getting out of my dumpster of an apartment for a few days; and the chance to actually see what happens during the weekend.

Jacob has cameras all over the place to check up on his dogs. I figured if I crashed on his couch, I’d be in plain view of his home security system. 

There were a few theories I wanted to test. Firstly: was my haunting somehow tied to my apartment? Sure, as far as I knew, G was a supernatural entity. But could he track me to different addresses? If he could… would he show up on camera?

I headed to Jacob‘s first thing after my Friday shift. His career as a lawyer had been slow to take off, but paid extremely well. He lived in a gorgeous townhome; tall and skinny like something you might find on a winding European street. I walked his pair of German shepherds around the block beneath the warm yellow street lamps, willow trees, and Spanish moss. 

I fed them, ordered myself takeout, and fell asleep watching reruns on the living room couch.

When I opened my eyes, I spotted Jacob a couple seconds before he saw me. He tapped his fingers on the countertop, watching the coffee maker fill his travel mug, messenger bag already hung his shoulder. It was Monday, and he was running late to work.

One of his dogs leapt on top of me, tail 
wagging.

“Maisey, get down,” Jacob called from the kitchen. He started walking over. “You know you’re not allowed on the—“ his coffee cup clattered to the floor. “Evan? You’re still here? Scared the shit out of me man, I’ve been home for two days.”

I clambered to my feet. “Jacob…”

“I know you’ve been a mess since the divorce by this is not cool! What the hell are you doing?”

There was no way I could make him believe me on my word alone. I had to get him to check the security feed—as much to save one of my few remaining friendships, as to satisfy my own curiosity.

“You don’t understand, man. I went to sleep right there, Friday night. I haven’t moved since,” I said. “Something is happening to me. Sleepwalking or something. I’m not getting rest. Look—no, no; really look at me! I don’t think I’ve slept in a week.”

Jacob tilted his head and looked me up and down, like he was trying to figure out whether it was all some prank. “You look like shit.”

“Yeah, and feel ten times worse.”

“I’m sorry you got raked over the coals in divorce court. But Emma and Vicki are still tight. I don’t want to get dragged into this…”

I took a step closer. “I’m not trying to drag you into anything. Would you please just check your security footage? Let me prove I’m not lying to you.”

Jacob sighed. “I’m already going to be late.” He gestured down at his coffee stained clothes. “What’s another ten minutes?”

We sat down at his kitchen counter, where he opened his laptop and logged into his home security account. With a few keystrokes, he pulled up the video feed from the living room. “Alright. What do you want me to look at?”

I squinted at the computer screen. “I finished dinner and went to crash on your couch a little after ten. Maybe start there?”

“Wait, you stayed here?”

“Yeah that’s what I’m trying to tell you.”

Jacob frowned. “I got a noise alert at about a quarter after. Figured it was just you leaving for the night.” He scrubbed over to 10:13, right on the noise alert, and pressed play.

Both dogs were going absolutely nuts, barking, growling, and snarling at the couch where I’d slept. I stared at the screen in disbelief. I wasn’t there.

“What’s got them so worked up?” Jacob whispered.

After a few minutes, both dogs jumped, startled by something that wasn’t showing up on camera. They backed out of the room, whimpering.

“Do you mind…?” I reached for the mouse.

“Go for it.”

I slid the play head back a few seconds before the dogs started their tantrum. “There I am on the couch. Let’s see.” I hit the space bar. I tossed and turned, tangled up with the throw blanket then…

“Gone.” The word tumbled out of my mouth, but I didn’t quite feel like I was the one saying it. One frame, I was laying there. The next, I just wasn’t. 

I didn’t know what I expected, but it wasn’t this. If I wasn’t on the couch, where had my body spent the last two days? My heart raced as I considered the possibilities.

Jacob snapped me out of it.“You’re screwing with me.” He couldn’t believe his own eyes.

“No!” How could I convince him? “Go to today, how do I get to this morning?” 

“Here.” He took over the keyboard, skipping though the footage. I saw Jacob come home, greet the dogs, then bustle around as the weekend zipped before us on the screen.

“There—stop!” 6:00, on the dot, I popped back into existence on the sofa. In the background, Jacob continued his morning routine in the kitchen. 

“Did you get Kevin in on this?”

I shook my head. “Look at me, do I look like I’m in the mood to joke around?”

He remained skeptical, until he checked his security system activity report. The alarm had been armed, both when I vanished and reappeared. But the door and windows sensors confirmed no one had been in or out during that time.

We both called off work. Then we called our friend Kevin. He was a lanky beanpole of a guy; a cargo shorts-wearing cinephile who worked in VFX. He came over and confirmed that no, I hadn’t roped him into some elaborate prank. 

He watched back the footage a half dozen times before concluding: “This is legit. Can’t say what happened to Evan, but the footage hasn’t been tampered with.”

“You’re sure?”

“Think of what you’re suggesting. You’re watching on your security company’s site,” he said. “Evan would’ve had to somehow access their server, and replace the real footage with an extremely good fake. He doesn’t know how to do any of that.” Kevin turned to me. “You wanna tell us what’s been going on with you?” His tone was direct, but not unkind. And was that a hint of curiosity?

I couldn’t meet their eyes. I felt like a lunatic trying to get the words out. So I looked down at the kitchen table instead. “About two weeks ago, I came home drunk. Really drunk. There was someone in my apartment.”

“Like a break-in?” Kevin asked.

“No.” I shook my head. “He was waiting for me. Said he was a lawyer representing Vicki.”

Jacob scoffed. “Like you’ve got anything left to take.”

“That’s what I thought,” I said. “He wanted time, Jacob.”

“Time?”

“Every night at 3a.m…. He takes hours. Every weekend… he takes days.” 

“How does he take your time?” Jacob asked.

“You just saw how.” I pointed at the laptop screen. “Friday night was less than an hour ago, from my perspective.” 

Both friends studied me again. I was sure they were looking at my sunken, bloodshot eyes. 

“You’re really telling the truth,” Jacob said. “Something comes into your room every night to collect your time.”

“Jesus,” Kevin said.

Jacob just chewed his lip, staring at the screen. “What do you think would happen if we were with you at 3? 

I craned my neck and pulled down my collar, exposing my bruises. “I tested that theory myself last week.”

“Yeah, but you were alone,” Kevin pointed out.

“And you didn’t have your lawyer present,” Jacob said.

I raised an eyebrow. “What are you suggesting?”

“That you tell us exactly what you agreed to. And I help you get a fair deal.”

The rest of the day has been spent planning. Kevin went back to work to grab some videography equipment that he thinks will help us see where my body actually goes when it disappears.

Jacob dug up his old law text books. He said something about brushing up on contracts. I’m not sure what’s going to happen to me at 3 AM. Given what happened last time I tried to skirt the system, I’m worried what G will do to me when I come with friends.
