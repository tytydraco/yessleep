This isn’t a story. 

It was about a year ago now and i still think of it to this day. I was laying in bed next to my partner, we had both fell asleep around 10 or 11 that night which was kind of out of the ordinary for us because we are normally night owls.

 I wanna preface this story right here before going any further that neither of us do drugs, drink and have both not really even smoked weed since november of 2022, it had been at least a month or two at this point that neither of us smoked.

Have  you ever had like a dream inside of a dream? It was one of those. So I didn’t think I was sleeping but most certainly was. I turn over and check my phone it’s around 2am, and everything seems real normal then the door opens, it has to have opened only enough for a person to slip in and out.

 I open my eyes in the dream and i see what appears to be a man that’s around 8 or 9 foot tall standing at the foot of my bed. He leans over my partner and stares at him dead in the face but while standing there just slowly gets closer and closer and gets so close it’s like he could kiss him. 

The odd part is he’s still at the edge of the bed and his body is leaned over the bed. We have a queen sized bed and it’s raised, humanly this wouldn’t be possible. I try to move but it feels like there’s bricks on my chest, I’m stuck. 

My partner on the other hand, I’m  hearing him make uncomfortable sounds in his sleep like something is wrong but i can’t wake him up. I began using the only bit of strength i have left in my body to tap my boyfriend with my hand, we’re laying backs flat side by side and i’m on the edge. 

I finally am able to pull myself out of it, I wake up as he stands straight up and moves toward my side of the bed. My eyes open. He sees me, he looks as if he’s moving from the end of the bed to the side of the bed where i’m at then i raise my body up. 

It’s weird. It was kind of like I scared him if I was to put it in words. He slowly walks to the center of the room, he’s facing away from me now then the figure in less than 2 seconds vanished into thin air. 

Our room door is always shut at night and obviously at this point I’m not going back to sleep so I get up and check the door and it’s cracked open. I check my phone and it’s 2:32am. 

How long did this go on for, I wonder, was it real? How did this happen, I’m a witch, I thought I was protected. The truth is, No one’s safe from The Hat Man
