I'm not super tech savvy, but I have friends in low places and they assure me that even if you report this, the police will never track down the IP address. I just wanted to share with someone. Anyone. Maybe there are others out there like me.

Normally I have to sneak up on them, find a hiding place in the house and wait for them to let their guard down. Here, there was plenty of cover, but it was hard to move fast through the garbage, let alone quietly. Luckily she was in her own little world, and she's small. All I had to do was push one of the stacks over on her. She built her own booby trap.

Not like the last guy. He was huge. The stun gun wasn't going to do it and it would take too long to use a rag on him, so I went for a rear naked choke. It was hard to find his neck… or his pulse. By the time he did finally go under, he had left a hole for me to spackle. Took forever to drag his fat ass into the bathroom.

That's how I do it. Immobilize them, restrain, then leave them in the bathroom while I work on the rest of the house. I dust, I scrub, and I mop until it's all clean. Well, clean as I can manage given the window of time. Sometimes it's just faster and safer to paint over.

Then I go to work on them. Wax, shave, and bath. Usually they're awake by the time I get to them and I have to hit them again with the rag.  Some of them realize what I'm doing or they are too scared to move, and they just cooperate. The Brazilian is always their least favorite part. The enema is mine. I have cards with text that I can show them tone explain without giving them my voice.

“Hello, you are being visited by the Badger. Your burrow is unclean, but we're about to fix that, and then I will let you go. Please don't make me come again. This will all be over soon, and you'll have a fresh start.”

I had to add that part about “the Badger” just because I don't want the police to give me some moniker like “the Mad Maid.” I saw a documentary once about how clean badgers keep their dens, so why not? Their neat little animals.

I might have bitten off more than I can chew this time though. She's small. One of her credit cards isn't maxed out and I rent a dumpster. I’m already gussied up in cleaning equipment, so people just assume I was hired. They can't see my face. 

Just about threw my back out throwing all of the garbage away. Some of it was actually useful stuff, but I just don't have time to sift through it. There was so much. I had to jump up and down on certain things to get them to crush into the dumpster. They may still not take it.

That last guy, the big son of a bitch, lived in an apartment complex full of people just like him. I could have gone door to door. Luckily the bathroom still works. You know what they say about these people,

“When the toilet goes, everything goes.”

Unfortunately, they always say something else too.

“Why is there always poo?”

Mouse droppings. Lots of them. If she had been hoarding cats, I probably would have moved on and not picked her. I can't tackle that much on my own. I'm not even sure if I can handle this. It took a long, long time to work past the gag reflex. 

I pop by the bathroom and feed her an MRE.  I cut away the clothes. She's afraid at first until I put a reasonably clean blanket over her. I refill the 3 guinea pig water bottles hanging from the shower curtain rod and make sure they're where she can reach them.

I realize I've been at this for 16 hours straight and I need to sleep. I set an alarm and roll out my kit; a tarp with a sleeping bag. The clothes I strip off I swiped from a donation bin and then washed elsewhere. I give myself a bird bath with wet wipes and zip up. 

Sometimes I dream about how great it would be if you could just separate yourself from the filth. I imagine standing in a black void, and just taking a few steps backwards. I can feel the oil on my skin and hair tug away. Any blackheads or pus vacuumed out of my pores, because the filth isn't going to move, but I am. Imagine any unwanted growths, unwanted hair, dead skin, grit under my nails, tumors inside me, the little floaty things in my eyeballs,  the stool in my colon somehow traveling through me and out. Like the bone and tissue just part ways and then seal it behind it when it's gone, like pulling a rock out of the water.

I'm standing naked in the black void, and there's a sculpture made of refuse in front of me. A sculpture of everything disgusting about the human condition, and behind it, I am laboratory grade clean. Cleaning up to eat off of. But then the thing turns around and climbs into my throat. 

There's a rustling noise. I wake up with a nasty taste in my mouth. One of the mouse traps snapped. Where there is one, there are always more, so I leave decon in all the nooks and crannies they might find that no sane person would ever bother to look.

The place isn't clean. It's not to my standards, but I'm running out of time. There's a hole in the corner where something ate through. They are going to have to cut the plywood away and replace it, but it can't be my problem. Her family or whoever owns the place can do it. The fact they can reach it now means I already did them a favor.

I set to work on the bathroom. She has messed herself, which isn't rare. I kind of left her no other choice. So I ignore it for as long as I can while cleaning the rest of the bathroom. I start to work on her cleaning. She doesn't know what my intentions are, so she's frightened at first, then relieved. Then frightened again when I start plucking whiskers off her lip.

 The clawfoot bathtub only gives me a slight advantage in that she is propped upright more and elevated off the ground slightly, but my lower back is still killing me. Finally, she's all cleaned up and ready to…

Damn it! She isn't moving and has gone cold. In a panic, I pat her face. I forgot to put something underneath her. This thing is metal and sucks heat and this one has taken way longer than usual. She's hypothermic.

I have to finish, but it doesn't do any good if she dies. She'll never get a chance to appreciate this gift. I heat up the water to just tolerable and clean her, scrubbing gently and quickly as I can manage. There will be marks from the gag and zip ties, but I don't have time to worry. I lay out some clothes and dial 911, but don't say anything. The bath will be warm by the time they get here and all of the evidence outside of the dumpster will be gone.

I'm still trying to figure out a way to prop her head up above the surface of the water when I hear them come through the door. I slip out the bedroom window and I'm gone.

I can't keep tabs on her. Hopefully she made it and got to stay for a while. If not, the landlord probably appreciated it. This work is hard, but rewarding. I'm exhausted, but I can't take more than a few days off. I have a new client lined up already.
