The moonlight streamed in as I rested my head on the cool side of my recently flipped pillow. I closed my eyes and listened to the soft rustling of the leaves outside, gently swept by the heavy snowstorm. I could feel the draft fighting its way in through the narrowest of crevices. I welcomed the frigid wind; it blended and perfectly mixed in with the heat emanating from the fireplace. It could have been Christmas, the crackling of the burning wood echoing endlessly.

Sleep continually eluded me. I gazed outside at the woods slowly filling up with snow. Each snowflake seemed to follow its predestined path, never deviating. I followed some with my eyes unblinking when I noticed something else in the distance. Two white dots in the distance, the eyes of a snow leopard surely. Then, faint singing in the distance immediately caught my attention. I cupped my hands around my ear, closed my eyes and there it was. It was wane yet recognizable enough for me to understand the haunting melody.

“Blue moon. You saw me standing alone without a dream in my heart. Without a love of my own.”

I gasped and opened my eyes. It seemed impossible – someone singing out there at this hour of the night? I shook my head, trying to make sense of it. If there was someone outside, they would be at risk of getting attacked by the snow leopard as well. My heart raced at the thought of adventure, yet the warmth of my home beckoned me to turn a blind eye and embrace the comfort of my bed.  I nudged such adventurous thoughts away before I put away my chair and Geronimo Stiltoned my way under the sheets once again. I closed my eyes again, but I found myself intoxicated with the sweet melody yet again. It was on repeat. Every note resonated endlessly inside my mind, the soothing sound beckoning me to follow it to its source.

Thus, there I was, slowly finding myself waddling through the knee-deep snow. Mumbling under my breath like a worn-out grandpa while my youth dreamt up increasingly beautiful possibilities of what could be there in the unknown. Adjusting the rifle slung across my shoulder, I hoped it wasn’t the leopard.

“Blue moon. You saw me standing alone without a dream in my heart. Without a love of my own.”

I hummed as I slowly trudged through the snow, trying to pinpoint where the sound could have come from. Then I heard it once again. The very same lines. My heart fluttered at the thought of being able to see this singer that had bewitched me. In just a few moments, I found myself at the very edge of the lake behind my property. Enveloped by the trees, it was like an oasis in the summer. It even doubled as a place to ice skate in the winter. Surely some shy damsel must be practicing here, away from her own comfortable wooden home which lacked the auditory privacy for her to sing her lungs out.  I caught another glimpse of the very same eyes that I had seen before from my house. However, they were much closer this time. A leopard isn’t taking me out before I see this singer for myself. I grabbed my rifle in my hands and inched closer to where the singing was coming from. It was the third time I had heard those very same lines. They sounded so much louder now, I must be uber close. It was then that I finally saw her. The most beautiful woman I had ever seen, in a white nightgown, standing there as if in defiance of the very elements that we build houses to seek protection from.

I beckoned out to her, “Hey, lovely singing!”. Awkward but it was the best I could come up with. Yet she said nothing. She stood there smiling gently. I could almost feel the warmth oozing out of her body. There was nothing amiss about the situation, my memory gave me no recollection, yet I felt like I had known her for a long time. I almost longed to give her a long hug, as if I was meeting a long-lost friend. I slowly inched closer, her eyes were closed so maybe she could be deaf. It would also explain why she was singing without care and did not respond when I called out to her. As soon as I was a few steps away from her, I noticed it. The clouds over the moon made it darker than it was. Her eyes were not closed. I looked straight into her eyes and every pore of my body instantaneously bubbled up with fear. She had no eyes. I was looking straight down here eye sockets. I collapsed down to my knees. My body wouldn’t move at all. Time seemed to slow down. All I felt was a deep pit in my stomach and the wind against my skin. My senses slowly seemed to dumb down as if I was in a drunken stupor. Everything went blurry as I went to sleep. I don’t know what happened. I couldn’t feel the cold anymore. It was like falling into a deep coma. Yet I felt oddly wonderful. There was no fear anymore, the snow felt like the best bedding I had ever fallen asleep on.

I woke up in my room the very next day. I knew because the calendar said it was 2 June. My birthday. My memories, however, were still intact. I distinctly remembered every single detail of what had occurred the previous night. Yet nothing made sense. I was safe in my nightgown. The rifle is right on the wall where it is supposed to be. My snow boots are right next to the door, perfectly clean. So, I chalked it up to a lucid and vivid nightmare. I crawled out of bed and started making my early morning toast - perfectly golden and richly lathered with butter.  It would go perfectly with the tea I had just made. I sat down with my plate on the table. With the first bite of my perfect toast, I started laughing about the dream. The mind is a mystery we shall solve one day, I chuckled. As I went in for the second bite, my entire body froze. It was whispered right into my ear this time --

“Blue moon. Now I am no longer alone. Without a dream in my heart. Without a love of my own.”
