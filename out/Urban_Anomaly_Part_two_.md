I ran straight to the car and locked myself in, before realizing James was still out there. I opened the console and quickly grabbed the masks. 

I could hear yelling from outside, and from the window James was standing at a distance. He was waving his arms, presumably wondering what the hell I was doing. I jumped out and told him not to check out the smell. He told me he couldn’t smell it anymore, and I was stunned. What? I kept thinking. The smell was stronger than ever.

I told him about the fox, and he looked upset for a moment, then glanced at the ground solemnly. There was nothing we could’ve done to help it. He argued over what could possibly have done such a thing, and I had no reply. I just watched him pacing around. He looked back at me and asked about the smell. 

I told him it was still burning my nostrils, and he repeated that he couldn’t smell it anymore. Then he realized that he couldn’t seem to smell anything. I closed my eyes and just tried to focus; to think of some explanation for all this. He called my name, but I shushed him. He called for me again, this time sounding worried. I wondered what could it be this time? 

I opened my eyes to find James barely holding himself up from the gravel path, blood rushing from his nose. I immediately started to panic and rushed to help him up. We both started frantically trying to make any sense of what was happening but still, there was no explanation. 

I laid him down in the backseat of the car, and I locked the doors. We just remained silent for a while, staring off. My heart was pounding, and James was hyperventilating. Was it all anxiety? Were we just being hypochondriacs? I checked to see how James’ nose was looking. The bleeding had stopped, but he still felt cold inside, especially in his head. 

That’s a feeling I could understand. It seemed almost like an anxiety attack, given the hyperventilating and the constant nervousness. I’d supposed it wasn’t impossible for a more severe case to cause a nosebleed. I’m no doctor, but that was the only theory that resembled reason. James seemed to like the idea. I could tell things were easing up, and the atmosphere was settling down.

Ever since we’d arrived, the place had felt off. And every explanation came with a new question. But we couldn’t just leave now. If we pushed hard enough, we’d complete our goal. Not that we had any specific tasks in mind. Sure, we wanted excitement but this bullshit wasn’t the kind we had anticipated. 

I asked him if he felt like going home, or if he wanted to take a drive. He reminded me that we needed to check out the hardware store in the nearby town. I couldn’t believe he was still thinking about that. I paused for a second, then asked if he was serious. He just nodded, wiping his nose. I could tell he was embarrassed about everything that had happened. He seemed to look to me for advice and encouragement, so I told him I was nervous too.

He knew that, but gave me a smile. He said he just wanted to grab another beer and forget about the craziness. And that sounded like a good plan to me. But we were both making excuses to stick around.

It felt like we were walking into a trap. I like to think someone was watching us and just saying go! Turn around and get out of there already! But we decided to keep pushing further. 

We stayed in the car for a good half hour. I’d occasionally roll down the windows to see if the smell was gone, but it lingered. Over time, it got less severe but the stench didn’t truly dissipate until a bit later. 

Eventually I grew used to it and stepped out of the car. James jumped out with me. He looked fine enough, and his body was holding out well. He noticed me checking on him and started to walk ahead. Like my looking made him uncomfortable.

Back at camp, the fire was barely burning, and the ice in the cooler had partially melted. We each grabbed a can and chugged them down. That settled the nerves right, and we were able to continue talking about the drones, albeit with a sense of urgency. 

We were both pretty tolerant when it came to holding down a drink, so neither of us were drunk per say, but we most definitely were not sober. For some reason we agreed to start a flight test with the drone right then, and so we booted it up and made sure it had some juice. It was nearly fully charged. We somehow managed to get it up in the sky, but it was all downhill from there.

James handled the controls and I watched, focusing on the screen. But the image was wobbly and grainy. It was hard to make out much detail in the sea of green and brown through the low resolution picture. 

He kept steering around the tree tops, trying to capture clear angles, but he couldn’t seem to control it once we crossed the forest threshold. As soon as we had the frontside of the mall in view, the rotors malfunctioned, and the drone started pivoting and moving erratically.

We were both freaking out trying our damndest to safely land the thing, but it was losing more and more control. James was sweating, and I couldn’t blame him. That thing probably cost him a small fortune. He started mashing the controls even harder but it did nothing. The drone was gone, and the feed went dark. 

He threw his glass at a tree and shouted. I was mad too. Not only because James lost his drone, but because we had lost our best method of observing the surrounding area. We’d have to do it all on foot if the drone couldn’t be repaired. 

This was something we could at least partially explain as a technological failure. So we weren’t immediately checking the radar for ghosts and ghouls, but there was something undeniably wrong about the place. We saw it then, but we didn’t want to relent. Partially because we’re both stubborn, and mostly because we weren’t thinking straight.

I took a deep breath and sighed, while James went frenetic. I was used to seeing him riled up but this was an extreme outburst. 

His face looked about as red as a tomato and his cheeks were flush. I told him we could fetch it after cutting through the bush. That it was probably fine. Minor damage at worst. 

We both counted on it having been caught in the foliage. That would have at least mitigated some of the impact. It isn’t like searching the outside of the building on foot would be that much slower, but still, we really wanted to test out the drone and save time for exploring. 

I sat down by the dying fire and watched the decrepit mall peeking through the treetops. I felt watched back. The trees appeared to block any and all potential paths almost intentionally. This place was truly sealed off tight. It didn’t seem natural to either of us. There were literally no openings at all. Absolutely none whatsoever. 

At first, I had imagined the weaving branches as something akin to a wall or a fence, but now it began to resemble a spider web. I drowsed in and out of consciousness, feeling the drink coming down, and my worried thoughts just hit me. Why the hell couldn’t we see the damn place on any maps or GPS? I had to get the exact location off some sketchy website. What was up with the fox? The shit it was hiding. The nosebleed. All of it was so weird. 

Every location I visit has stories. People will tell you about all sorts of crazy shit, like phantoms and demons, or other kinds of enigmatic entities. And this place wasn’t any different.

People had mentioned that the area was cursed. Some claimed the building itself was some sort of spirit. A few whack jobs wrote about conspiracies. The same old nonsense. Obviously I wrote it all off as bullshit, but I still wanted to find out what was getting everyone so worked up. 

As the mall captured my stare, I realized the answer to my question. James called to me, snapping me from the trance, and I stumbled out of the chair, nearly spilling onto the ground. I felt more sober with each step, but James sounded like he hadn’t touched a drop in his life. 

He was hollering about how I had just left him. How I was gone for hours. I thought he was crazy. He knew where I was, I mean I wasn’t more than 15 feet behind him, not moving a muscle. You couldn’t have missed me. 

He wasn’t satisfied, and ran up to me with bulging eyes. His face read shock loud and clear. I knew something was up. He suddenly rubbed his hand down my cheek. Dirt and blood covered his fingers. 

He asked me where I went again and what had happened to me, and I repeated that I didn’t know what the hell he was talking about. That’s when I looked up to notice the sun already setting. I checked my phone and five hours had come and gone in a flash. 

James started to get the picture that I really didn’t understand the situation. I told him I had just taken a nap for a few minutes by the fire, but his story was a lot different. He told me that after I walked away, I completely disappeared. Vanished without warning. He thought I was fucking with him at first, but after five minutes he was concerned. 

I was baffled. I hadn’t just poofed out of existence. I was right there the whole time. We were genuinely considering packing up and leaving now. I grabbed my things and put my tent away. I almost started to take down his tent, but James tried to argue.

As we bickered about leaving, a devastatingly loud crash echoed from somewhere. I quickly shuffled into James’ tent and we sealed the flap without a second thought. We just sat there quietly, making sure to be unheard and preferably unseen. That was our last straw, or so we thought. We didn’t need to parse any words to know we were going the very moment we could get gone. 

The crash reverberated outside, snapping back and forth between all directions. Shit man! I mumbled to myself. I was done for one night. My heart pounded in sync with the thunderous echoes. We were both tired.

I locked eyes with James and he gave me the same confused look I had grown angered of. After a while I fell back, and rolled onto my side facing the tent wall. I passed out soon enough, in spite of the noise. 

When I woke up, I felt dazed and confused. I reached for my phone, unable to feel it beside me. Then I looked over to see James. He was on his knees, staring at my phone screen. Something was wrong with him. I asked him what he was doing and he just pointed the screen to me. The time hadn’t changed at all. The sound had also stopped. 

James started to laugh under his breath. He told me he couldn’t get any sleep, so he waited there for nearly an hour watching me, but time didn’t follow. It was weirdly quiet. More than it had been before. The only sound to be heard was our own voices. No insects chirping or wind blowing. 

My anxiety began to finally take over. It was getting so damn hard to hold out. I told him to stop laughing. To just listen. His mouth quivered and his neck twitched left to right. I just focused, trying to hear something. Anything at all. The silence felt like a substance that penetrated through my ears and into my brain. 

That was it. I jumped up and started to unzip the tent door. I nearly tore it in two the way I yanked so hard. And as it opened I fell through into a mid-day storm. 

Somehow, the sun was out, albeit covered by thick stormy clouds and the sound of a low rumble reverberated through the sky, not unlike the noise from earlier. Light now shone through the tent. 

A jolt of lightning cracked in the distance, and not a second later did the sound emit once more. James was freaking out. He didn’t dare leave the tent as he paced in circles. I checked my phone, but the screen flickered off. The button wasn’t working. I kept tapping the screen and pushing the power, but nothing happened.

Unsure of what to do, I put my phone into my pocket. I stared at the sky, trying to think of something. How the storm seemed to appear from nowhere. How the night turned to day without a trace. James was barely managing, but he was coherent. At least I wasn’t alone in this shit show. 

I grabbed him by the arms and shook him good. His teeth were chattering and he grabbed me back. He clung tightly to me. He was beyond terrified, and I was tired of playing brave. I was scared too. 

We had convinced ourselves to stay by rationalizing the strange occurrences, but this couldn’t be reasonably explained. Even if I could conjure up some excuse, nothing good could possibly follow. 

Did some sort of EMP wipe out our systems? That would explain the phone and the drone, but what about the storm? What about the sun? It was pitch black outside, and then it wasn’t. 

Maybe the time was wrong, but that didn’t change much. The tent was partially transparent, and thin enough that any sounds outside could be heard loud and clear. And that sound. The thunder. It’s the same sound we heard before. Like a warning. No explanation was good. But neither was observable reality. It didn’t work. The logic didn’t fit. 

James interrupted my moment of pause and shouted that we had to get out of there immediately. I told him I was thinking the same thing and we ran out of the tent. Both of us were booking it faster than we ever had before. The car was right there. Escape was near. 

There was no time to think about what we left behind. The mall could keep it all. As far as I was concerned, the rumors were true. This place was as cursed as they came.

I put the key in the ignition so fast I almost sprained my wrist. The sound of the engine running was like magic at the time. But something was wrong. The car wouldn’t fully start. 

James was pounding against the dashboard telling me to hurry up, but I didn’t know what to do. After every twist it would roar to life before shutting down again. I cursed loudly and slammed my fist into the horn. No! Not now! Come on! I screamed internally. 

James told me we should have taken his truck and he was right. We were trapped, and it was all my fault. It was all because of me. My despair surged as I felt something warm trickle down my chin. It was my blood.
