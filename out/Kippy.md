Baby dont worry its just an imaginary friend every kid has it at their age.

I stare at my beautiful babygirl, Leia giggling at the corner of our small condensed living room. I know I sound crazy but something about “Kippy” her friend feels weird, odd even.

Marcus notices my hesitation in replying and pulls my chair closer so I am wedged between him and kisses my head.

It's okay Mare, it will work out, is just a phase Marcus says, clearly not on his mind anymore.

I watch Leia giggle again, her tiny frame shaking with delight as she clutches at the air, as though her small hand has found something—or someone—to hold onto. Marcus's warmth beside me is grounding, but the unease in my chest refuses to dissipate.

Leia is still giggling, her wide, curious eyes locked on the empty corner of the room, her laughter melodic yet unsettling in the stillness of the evening. Kippy loves playing with me, Mama, she says suddenly, turning her head toward us but still speaking to someone unseen. He says I’m his favorite.

Marcus squeezes my hand. Mare, don’t overthink this. She's just a kid. Kids make things up. It’s their imagination. His voice is calm, steady, but I can’t stop myself from leaning forward, trying to understand what Leia sees.

Who is Kippy, Leia? I ask, my voice careful not to betray the growing knot of dread in my stomach. What does he look like?

Leia’s head tilts to the side, as if she’s genuinely confused by my question. She doesn’t answer for a long moment, and then, in a voice so soft I almost miss it, she whispers, Kippy says you already know.

I shiver involuntarily, and Marcus notices. It’s just a phase, he says again, this time a little firmer, as though willing me to believe it.

Leia, come here, baby, I say, my voice trembling. Leave Kippy for a bit and sit with us.

Her giggle stops abruptly, like someone flipped a switch. Her face, still so young and innocent, darkens with something that doesn’t belong there. Kippy says he doesn’t like you, Mama.

Marcus laughs nervously. Kids say the weirdest things, don’t they? 

But I can’t tear my eyes away from Leia. The way her posture stiffens. The way her gaze flickers back to the corner of the room.

He loves me more, Leia says, her voice suddenly defiant, as if she’s challenging me.

Marcus stands, trying to lighten the mood. Alright, Leia, let’s give Kippy some space. He probably needs a nap or something. Why don’t we—

Leia screams, piercing and sharp. Her small hand shoots out, clawing at the air in front of her. Kippy doesn’t nap! He says you’ll never make him go away!

Marcus freezes mid-step, his face paling. Leia, what’s wrong? he says, but she doesn’t answer. Instead, she clutches her arm and bursts into tears. Marcus turns to me with bewildered eyes, I rush to her, scooping her up as she wails. Her arm is red, and deep, angry scratches trail down the inside of it—scratches that hadn’t been there seconds ago. My blood runs cold.

What happened? I demand, my voice sharp with fear.

Leia sobs into my shoulder. Kippy got mad because you don’t believe in him mama, why didn’t you?

Marcus stares, wide-eyed, his composure cracking. Mare, that… that looks bad. What did she do? Did she scrape against something? Did she—

I didn’t do anything! Leia shrieks, her face wet with tears. It was Kippy! He’s mad, Mama. He’s so mad.

We exchange a look, Marcus and I. Neither of us says it, but the unspoken words hang in the air between us, heavy and suffocating. This isn’t normal.

That night, I barely sleep. Leia is curled up between Marcus and me, her tiny body trembling even in her dreams. The scratches on her arm seem to pulse under the dim light of the bedside lamp, as though alive.

Marcus whispers to me in an urgent whisper unlike his usual demeanor, careful not to wake Leia. Mare, we should take her to a doctor tomorrow. Maybe a child psychologist. They’ll know what’s going on.

I nod, though my mind races with questions, I knew Marcus was right but could we afford all those treatments? What if they had to take Leia away? How do you explain scratches like that? How do you explain Kippy or whatever the fuck Kippy pretends to be?

Around 3 a.m., I heard it. A faint tapping sound, rhythmic and deliberate. It’s coming from the corner of our bedroom. The same corner Leia had been staring at earlier.

Marcus, I whisper, shaking him awake. Do you hear that?

He groans, barely opening his eyes. What is it now?

Listen, I say to him in a hushed whisper.

The tapping stops. Before Marcus can reply, we hear Leia scream awake on our bed.

She’s huddled in the center of our bed, her knees pulled to her chest, her face pale with terror. The room is cold—unnaturally cold—and the air smells faintly of sulfur.

He’s here, Mama, she whispers, her eyes wide and unblinking. Kippy’s here.

Marcus sits up and shakes Leia awake with his jaw tight. This is enough, Leia. Stop this nonsense.

But as soon as he says it, the room grows colder. And then, as if an invisible force slams into him, Marcus is air yeeted out of the bed and crashes into a wall.

I scream, pulling Leia into my arms. Marcus groans, struggling to his feet, but his face is etched with fear.

Leia, baby we have to leave now, I say, my voice trembling. We can’t stay here, we got to go okay, let’s go.

I carry Leia in my arms and rush to check on Marcus.

Wha-What the fuck Mare, Marcus says groggily.

No questions, just follow me. We are leaving now. 

Marcus nods as if the memory of him being ziplined across the bed has been jogged and we both make our way to the door of our bedroom in the darkness of the night.

But as we move to the door, it slams shut on its own. The sound reverberates through the room, shaking the walls. Marcus holds me tighter and we both take a step back, realizing whatever this is it’s bigger than both of us.

The air is eerily still. My heartbeat thunders in my ears, and I clutch Leia tighter to my chest. Marcus stares at the door, his jaw clenched, his body tense as though preparing for a fight. The room feels alive, the walls pressing in on us, suffocating.

Marcus moves to the door and grabs the handle, twisting and yanking with all his strength. It doesn’t budge. His knuckles whiten as he pounds against the wood. Open this damn door, he yells, his voice raw and desperate.

Leia giggles softly, the sound chilling in the silence. I thought Kippy was mad, but he’s happy now. He likes when you’re scared.

Marcus snaps his head toward her, his face pale. What did you just say, Leia?

I shush Marcus, trying to calm her down, my own fear masked for her sake. Leia, baby, listen to me. Kippy might not be nice, okay? We have to tell Kippy to leave us alone.

Kippy doesn’t want you to go, Leia says, her voice eerily calm. He wants to play.
