  It’s crazy how easy it is to know things now. The knowledge of the universe is constantly at the tips of our fingers. How would the world have turned out had social media not been invented? I was scrolling through tiktok and realized how much media I consume daily. It really does blow my mind. Not that I mind. It’s awesome that I can learn the answer to literally anything in seconds. But it’s also sort of terrifying. Like, I can know anything about anyone at any given time. I can search a random person’s name and find out their surname, where they live, if they have kids, etc. That also means they could do the same to me. They could probably track every single thing that’s happened in my life since the second I was born if they wanted to. I just think about this stuff all the time. I wonder, how much more of this can our species take until it collapses? I recently heard about a new compony that can literally grow babies inside a pod, and you can even customize them. It doesn’t seem too scary when you first think about it. In fact, on surface level it seems like a good step forward. People who may not have had the chance to have children do now. But if you then think about all the movies about things like that, take “The Matrix” Movies for example. What happened in those movies?? Nothing good, that’s for sure. AI took over the earth an the few people who broke out of the simulation were forced to live in underground colonies. I know a lot of people back in say, the 1990’s had notions like this one, too. 

“What happens on the year 2000?”

“Everything’s going to collapse” 

“How much more of this can we take until society collapses?” 

But unlike those times, I believe we may actually be nearing the end. Not that that’s bad. Maybe the world would be better off with us gone. Actually, there’s no question about it. She would be better off without us. And it is all a part of evolution. We develop, live out our short, mortal lives, and then die. So why is it so scary for our race to die that we’re even trying to transfer our consciousness into AI? Immortality is a scary thought for me. I take comfort in the thought that one day I won’t exist. Some will argue that that’s scarier than eternity, but to me, it seems peaceful. Peaceful enough. But there is an animalistic fear in me, and in everyone, that doesn’t want to die. An urge. You may ask yourself, as I am asking myself, “Humanity has survived this long, so what’s stopping us from going on for longer?” 

Well, it’s simple. The world is dying. We aren’t doing anything about it, and frankly, I don’t believe we can anymore. 100 years ago, I’d say it’s more than possible. But now? Absolutely not. One might suggest terraforming another planet and then living there. But that would take a much longer time than we have. Unless we’d be doing it all from a spaceship, like “Wall-E”, then there’s no hope. Not to be a pessimist, but I really do believe that there’s no future for the human race as it is. If we somehow evolve to live somewhere else or get the resources to do so, then good for us. But there’s really nowhere else for us to go. The observable universe as we know it is a wasteland, and our planet was once a perfect paradise. 

We have ruined it.
