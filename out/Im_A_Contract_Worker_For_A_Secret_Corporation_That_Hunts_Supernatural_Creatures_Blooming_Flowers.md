A week went by without a single job. Not even an email about medical plant collection or a lost supernatural creature job. Nothing.

August took some time off to recover. I didn’t want to go over and bother him. I spent most of my days picking up trash in the neighborhood. Allie had already moved on. He didn’t like staying in one spot for too long. He promised we would see each other again at some point.

I called people looking for work. Harp replied however she asked if we could meet. I hadn’t seen her in a while. I thought seeing a friend would be nice. The moment I saw her waiting in a dark park I knew this wouldn’t just be a pleasant catch up.

“You look terrible. Have you been getting enough sleep?” She said but her voice sounded forced.

“I’m fine. Just a lot of weird jobs lately.” I shrugged.

I hadn’t looked at myself recently. My hair needed to be cut. I bet I could use some new clothing as well.

“Are you part of a Hunter bloodline?” She said getting right down to the reason why she wanted to meet.

I expected people to ask this question and yet I didn’t have the words ready. Guilt was heavy in my stomach as she waited for my answer.

“Yes. I wasn’t raised in the family. My mother wanted to forget her past. I wasn’t trying to hide anything. I just didn’t consider myself one of them.”

She took a deep breath letting that sink in. We were friends. If I wanted children, we could have been more than that. Her hatred for Hunters conflicted against how she cared for me.

“I believe you. I know you have nothing to do with them I just... I’m having a hard time with this.”

I understood that. I was glad Harp wanted to clear the air in person. I would never force her to keep being friends. She could take as much time as needed to get her feelings in order. She leaned down to offer a hug that may be the last one we’ll ever have. I let her go wondering if we’ll ever work together again.

I headed back to my apartment feeling utterly sorry for myself. I needed a distraction. Thankfully April responded to my texts. We exchanged a few cat memes then suddenly she said she needed to go. She must have gotten a job somewhere.

Then someone I had been avoiding called.

Dr. Fillow said he had an opening in his schedule. He was going to come by to check on my leg regardless of what how I felt. Within the next few minutes, he was pounding at my door making it impossible to ignore him.

“You should make appointments for checkups more often.” He scolded after walking inside.

He adjusted his mask then set down a heavy bag of tools. I should have the cash on hand to pay for this visit. I had done a lot of high paying jobs recently. However, at this rate I would finish paying off one leg only for it to be replaced with a new one. Now I always felt a dull pain from it that went up my hips. With everything else going on I could easily ignore it. It wasn’t a very good sign though.

“I’ve been busy.” I defended myself.

He raised his eyebrows in a way that expressed how he felt about that comment.

“I’m surprised you’re even home right now. Your leg must be bad enough to not accept the current job that has your friends running around.”

I had sat down and lifted my bad leg for him to look over. When I didn’t reply he realized he said the wrong thing. I hadn’t been called and yet there was a big job happening? He sighed and stood up already giving up on any progress.

“Are you going to start calling people demanding information?” He asked with his arms crossed.

“This would go faster if you told me what you knew.” I told him standing up and walking towards the door.

“A hospital is on lockdown. You might know the creature causing problems. I’ll tell you the location. I don’t know much more than that.”

I thanked him trying to stay calm. This was clearly why April stopped texting. And from the looks of things everyone wanted me to stay away. Why? I’ve heard of supernatural creatures snapping and going feral. It was one of the reasons why Agents worked in pairs. I thought hard on trying to figure out who I knew that would ever start a problem like this.

Dr. Fillow created a connection to the hospital. I wasted no time running down the hallways pushing past people who were evacuating patients. I focused my sight looking for magic sources I recognized. April and August were here one floor above me. They were waiting outside a room with another creature pacing. Was it just one creature? It looked like it had two smaller sources of magic feeding off of it. No, they were joined together.

My leg screamed in pain when I ran up the stairs. I needed to ignore it. I turned the corner nearly knocking Evie over in the processes.

“What are you doing here?” She hissed at me.

I could ask her the same thing. August and April looked at each other to see who might have secretly called me.

“Who’s inside that room?” I asked her out of breath.

“We can handle this. You need to leave.” August said in a gentle yet stern tone.

He moved in front of a small shape on the ground as if trying to hide it. I took a step back when I saw a bundle of empty clothing laid down on the floor as if someone had melted out of them. They were a pair of blue scrubs and shoes next to a wheelchair. He wanted to hid the nametag but was too late.

Gina.

I’ve only met her once, yet everything snapped into place. My body moved on it’s own. They all reached out to stop me but I opened the door to the hospital room to see who was inside.

Jacob stood his long hair swaying in the breeze from an open window. He had his hand on the chest of a person resting in the bed. I felt August grab me from behind to start dragging me out of the room. I stood firm to watch what was happening.

We walked into the middle of a gruesome and yet almost peaceful transformation. Small vines came from Jacob's palm sinking into his sleeping mother’s chest. They over took her body in seconds. A bulb appeared on the side of his face as he drained away the body in front of him. A bright blue flower opened up as the vines died off crumbling away leaving nothing behind. The person he loved the most had been absorbed into him.  He looked over his shoulder, his eyes dull. His cold grin froze my feet to the spot.

When Jacob had been infected, the plant transformed him into something inhuman. At first, he didn’t appear dangerous so no one watched him properly which caused him to slip away. What he had done wasn’t out of malice. By absorbing others, he could be with them forever however they would lose their humanity. If he lashed out there was a chance, he could infect the entire hospital. August and Apri had been ordered to not confront him until people had been evacuated. As a result, his mother had been a sacrifice.

Jacob knew he couldn’t deal with the four of us. Since the building was mostly emptied out there was no point to him staying here. He bolted easily slipping through the window and out of sight. I pushed out of August’s grasp to follow after him without a single logical thought going through my head.

We were six floors up. Normally I would have broken something. There was a forest by the hospital. It was a stretch but I pulled enough magic from the air to cushion my fall. If we were in the middle of the city I would have been screwed.

Jacob landed first running like the devil off into the woods. If he put down roots, he could drain the entire forest dry making it impossible to deal with. We needed to stop him before he became a bigger problem.

I ran hard pulling every ounce of magic out of the ground with each step leaving dead soil behind. As a result, I moved faster than any human should. Every muscle strained against the motion as some started to tear. Faintly I felt the pain. I knew it was there. I just was far more focused on catching up.

Jacob finally stopped before my body gave out. August and April were a few seconds behind us. He spun around to face me, an expression of pure job over his face.

“Come and join me! We’ll be friends forever!” He cheered as he spun gracefully on the spot.

He looked like a child. Any stress had faded with his humanity. He only wanted to add new additions to his body unaware that killed the person in the processes. A chill ran down my spine when I thought of what it would be like becoming an apart of him. Everything that made you into a person was lost only to become a simple flower blooming on the side of his face.

A vine shot out latching on my arm to start the transformation. It wanted to drain my life forced, instead I started pulling power from him through the connection. I wanted to rip away all the magic out of his system. Maybe if he was fully drained, he would turn back to normal. I wanted to see the moody yet well-meaning kid I saved from the bugged hotel. Whatever he was now was simply not the person I knew.

August arrived carrying Evie. He stood in front of April defending her from more vines. He was too busy protecting the girls to do anything else. When the vines buried themselves into his flesh they shriveled up and died off. His blood protected him from poisons or infections. For some odd reason it wasn’t the same for April. The vines struggled but was able to latch onto her arm for a second until she ripped them off. Her magic always appeared slightly different than August. I didn’t consider the idea she may be a mixed breed. Due to that August needed to fight extra hard to protect her from becoming a part of Jacob.

He noticed his attack wasn’t working on me. He cut off the vine which caused me to close the distance between us. I grabbed his arm pulling out as much magic as possible determined to turn him back. He let out a yelp of pain. His arm shriveled up the broke off. He backed up creating a wall of plant matter between us that shot up from the ground. By the time I ripped through it he drained enough power from the forest to regrow his arm.

I went for him again blinded from what I was actually doing. He flinched away appearing scared. That reaction hit me hard. He was frightened of me. Of course he was. If I drained all his magic away, he would die. He wasn’t human any more. Nothing I did would change that.

I lowered my hands. Jacob backed away his eyes darting around considering his options. He already had roots down. If he followed through becoming one with the forest we would be forced to kill him. I doubted the four of us could handle that much power though. People would die if he went down that path. I hated myself for almost forcing him into that.

“You want to be friends, right?” I asked him my chest aching so much it felt like bursting.

He slowly nodded too trusting for his own good.

“I’ll let you have me. Just, let me give you a hug first.” I offered.

Any fear he held instantly faded. He accepted the request and fell into my arms letting me hold him.

“You did something nice for me before I was like this, right?” He said as I kept a tight hold him unaware of my plan. “I think I always wanted to be friends with you.”

Jacob tried to pull away but I didn’t let him. I needed to hold him still. Afterall, there was a reason why Evie was here. He finally noticed something was amiss when he felt a pressure around his neck.

“I’m so sorry.” I whispered to him knowing he would never be able to forgive me.

He let out a small strangled gasp of air as a spell started to tighten. He kicked unable to get away no matter how hard he struggled. His teeth came down on my shoulder drawing blood. I refused to let go. The process might have only taken a few minutes but it felt like hours. Finally, the spell clicked into place and his body fell limp. Carefully I placed him on the ground watching him weakly gasp for air. A new black band settled on his neck.

“This was the best outcome for him.” August said leaning over to see how I was doing.

Depending on how strong Jacob was he could be put to work fighting monsters. With the wrong Handler all of his freedoms could be taken away. August and April were lucky they had Evie. But she was just one person. She might not be able to watch over another creature. It was possible Jacob would be passed along to whoever was willing to pay the right price for him.

I felt my hand twitch. I wanted to do something. I didn’t know what though. I stood up and saw a nearby tree. An emotion I’d never felt before took over. Without a second thought I lashed out punching the trunk as hard as I could. The impact blew a huge chunk out of it. Seconds later the tree crashed down away from us the noises echoing through the normally quiet forest.

Glancing over I saw April behind Evie as if she was scared of what she just saw.

I flexed my hand surprised I only tore up the knuckles without breaking anything.

“I think I need to go.” I told them.

August called after me but he didn’t stop me from leaving. I don’t remember much of what I did for the rest of the day. I walked around completely randomly, a swarm of thoughts buzzing through my head until I finally got back to my apartment. I should have called Dr. Fillow to finish his checkup. I knew that and I didn’t listen to that thought.

I sat on my bed, my arms resting on my knees I tucked up to my chest. A strange popping sound brought me back to my senses. I was confused to see my index finger red and swollen. The pain was there at the same time I didn’t feel it. Slowly, I watched my right hand take hold of my left middle finger and pulled until something snapped. I watched it happen unable to take control. The sight of two broken fingers almost felt right. Somehow, I needed to do that. I didn’t break anything after punching the tree and I felt disappointed.

“What the hell is wrong with me?”

I didn’t even recognize my own voice. Slowly I laid down on my side thinking I just needed to sleep. Hours ticked by. My fingers started to change from red to blue. I didn’t move. I couldn’t sleep. A thousand thoughts came to mind. I should have called someone. No, I knew that was a bad idea. I couldn’t risk taking my emotions out on anyone.

A knock came from the door.

Ignore it I told myself. They’ll go away. Just stay in bed, don’t talk to anyone right now.

My cellphone started to ring. I let it go to voicemail. The person outside my door spoke to leave a message. Since my apartment was so small I could easily hear who it was.

My will finally gave out. It was as if I was watching my body stand up to open the front door. If I just focused, I could have stopped what was going to happen. But I didn’t.

“August called. He said you had a rough day.”

Ito looked like he just got off a job. A slight crack on the side of his perfect face and his suit covered in dust. He came by so we could talk. Or maybe August sent him over to make sure I hadn’t done anything stupid. He spotted my hands then carefully took the left one with his own.

“What happened?” He said clearly concerned.

Leaning over I brought him in for a kiss.

“Stay with me tonight.” I asked.

His jaw tightened at the suggestion. He thought of a million excuses to leave but didn’t say a single one. Ito wasn’t dragged inside my apartment. I didn’t ask him twice. He could have left at any time. He stayed because he was a good person. He knew what I asked for wasn’t healthy and gave in anyway.

I was the one who crossed all the lines he set that night. The light stayed on so he could see all the scars I tried to hide. I whispered words of affection he didn’t want to hear. I made it impossible for him to consider our relationship as just a casual fling.

And I hated myself for it.

Ito left silently in the morning without a conversation about what happened. I heard the front door close behind him while I pretended to be asleep. Hours went by. I just stayed in bed waiting for a text I knew was coming. Around noon my cellphone went off.

*‘Let’s take a break.’*

Ito was too kind hearted. He knew I needed him more than he needed me. He wasn’t ready for what I wanted and it was unfair if we kept seeing each other. This was clear from the start. I was the one who didn’t accept those facts.

While I was asleep, he wrapped my fingers. They still needed to be properly treated but it was something. I raised my hands to look at them bandaged and sore.

“What the hell is wrong with me?” I asked myself again to an empty apartment.

I didn’t think I would get any answers to that question. For now, I needed to get cleaned up and keep working. It was the only thing I could do.
