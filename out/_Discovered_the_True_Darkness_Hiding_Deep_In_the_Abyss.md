As I took a minute from my skull crushing routine, I made an attempt to stimulate my brain by taking in my surroundings. The at times sisyphean task of moving myself from the ironclad safety of my bedroom, before even the sun kisses the horizon, to a desolate room put me in a state of misery. The way the whole place rocked back and forth just felt like I was sitting on a buoy. The harrowing fluorescents cutting into the hallway to my office wasn’t any relief. The lights, which I'm very certain are the same used in interrogation rooms, seemed to glare at you as their overhead rays reflected right into the hospital white of the walls. My mother told me being a dentist would get me the cushy lifestyle I desired, but a few laps at the local pool coerced me into a job as an underwater researcher. I assumed that this job would involve sitting at home analyzing some odd squid caught by some gap-tooth fisherman. Instead, I became a member of the 20,000-workforce at the 70,000-square-foot research facility in the middle of the ocean. It sways no matter how many reinforced beams hold it up. Every day tests my resolve, challenging how long I can keep this position. **I hate it here**.



To provide a distraction from how “anything could be better than this” my work-life turned out, I began to get to work. In my inbox a classified message sat, differentiating itself with red bordering the subject line. My brow creased, and I began shooting out a million different possibilities on what this message could possibly entail. Without wasting any time, I spent a few moments looking at my rap sheet, just in case this message could mean I was getting fired–or maybe sued. Deciding to take my fate on the chest like a man, I opened the message with all the heart and bravery of a mouse.

Subject: Investigate these logs!!!! Re: team A total disappearance. 



*Hello,* 



*Just recovered all of team A’s written and video footage from the moment of surface tension breakage all the way to blackout.* 



*I've made a motion to relieve you from whatever current work you’ve been handling. This requires all your attention. Attached are the log files.* 



*Any deviation from course, or any rumor spreading and I will personally lay you out over the starboard.* 

  


*That is all.* 



*PS: If you take your usual slackers approach to this, and attempt day leaves because of “sea sickness” you will be denied. I am not a stranger to your methods, neither did I want to assign you to this project, but I lost by popular vote.* 



End Communication. 



A deep chill hit me harder than the blinding light of the desktop screen in my dim, steel, barely decorated office. My eyes, pressed close to the screen, fervently reread the short communication, a twinge of anger sprouted little by little when I glanced at the last passage. Yet, if my brows were not raised enough, they surely reached my hairline by the time I opened the log folder. 



**8:00 am MST, Start log**



Research Captain Jamieson Pecunia, head of Nauftes Team A exploration team aboard the B23.

Vessel contains 8 souls, all personally vetted by me. 

All systems have been inspected and follow Nauftes code of conduct for operation and maintenance standards. 



Descent will begin at 0830. 



**9:30 am MST** 



We’ve reached 5000m, well beyond the reach of sunlight. 

The B23 appears to exceed its predicted depth capacity, a promising sign for future missions. The vessel has held its structural integrity, and crew performance meets expectations. Nothing in this ocean can hold us back. I intend to test out how deep we can traverse, and have looked over the contracts the crew members signed– no liabilities if anything goes wrong. Hoping for the best. 

However, there was an unsettling incident: Oliver Mansted, our hydrographic surveyor, reported a sighting of something he described as resembling “Cthulhu.” The crew took it seriously, but after further inspection revealed nothing, the mood shifted back into silence. Mansted’s credibility is now in question, and he faces isolation. \\\\

As we began to dock at Delta 1, an unidentified object crashed into one of the thrusters. The Technician assured me the damage was superficial. 

I intend to have a drone assess it during our stay at Delta 1.

**9:50 am MST**

The walk from the docking bay to the common room in Delta 1 was frigid. I will add a mental note to pack heavier next trip. 

I let the crew settle into their respective dorms, then sent the drone out to scan B23. Results say 30% chance of catastrophe due to impact. I intend to push forward with those odds, and replace the technician as soon as we get back to the surface. Even if it takes the crew’s lifes, and mine, the report we will be sending back will be in its own league. 

I intend to get some rest now. 

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

As I read through the log, I saw a hyperlink to a separate pdf on the word Delta 1, and investigated it immediately. Underneath a mountain of confidential remarks, the most I got was that Delta 1 is a deep sea permanent structure. It is small, for Nauftes standards, with just enough space for 16 individual dorm rooms, a kitchen, and a captain's quarters. A bead of sweat dripped down my forehead as I imagined living conditions underneath how many psi of pressure in such depths. Must be the first of its kind. 

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

**6:00 pm MST**

It is 1800, and we’ve reached a depth of 7600 m. Sonar scans tell me that there are tens of thousands more miles underneath us unexplored. Abandoning current directives to study at 11,000 m, then returning to surface. However, we will still take samples at around 10,000 - 11,000 m.

I feel cold, and this cold makes me uneasy. It's as if frost is crawling inch by inch down my spine. I’ve spoken with the technician and he assures me temperature controls are functioning correctly. Despite this, the chill persists. 

**6:30 pm MST**

We’ve reached a depth of 10,000 m. I've let the researchers spend some time analyzing whichever it is they wanted to analyze. Early reports indicate groundbreaking findings. There seems to be a wide variety of unique fauna ripe for the picking. I’ve forwarded a notice to prepare a team for sample collection in the following weeks. 

**8:00 pm MST**

Some innate fear almost led me to send the team back up at around 2000. Currently 11,000 m. The fauna observed is unlike anything previously documented.

The initial discomfort was momentarily forgotten. The researchers’ enthusiasm about the unique fauna was palpable, and it felt like a rare reprieve from my now constant unease.

However, each meter seemed to drill ice deep into my skull. 

**8:20 pm MST**

I’ve noticed that the crew's behavior is growing increasingly bothersome. The technician keeps fiddling with the equipment, and others seem distracted, staring at the monitors as if expecting them to reveal some grand secret. I don’t recall this kind of behavior during training. It’s odd but not entirely concerning. I’ll need to address it soon.

Aside from that, things are going smoothly. I am still fairly worried about that damaged thruster, but after so much time without much issue I believe everythings going to be just fine.

**8:30 pm MST**

We’re at 13,000 m, deeper than any man has ever traveled. The fauna at these depths are even more perplexing creatures. 

However, we've been alerted of an alarming anomaly. Oxygen levels have risen significantly 1000-2000m below us. There is something producing oxygen. Mansted found a little relief, as the crew began buzzing with interest. 

Usually, I would have commanded silence, but I shared a similar excitement. 

The chill persists, and It’s unnervingly dark, I never really took the time to notice. 

The rise in oxygen levels was not just a curiosity—it was a potential breakthrough. This suggested an unknown biological process at these extreme depths, and the implications for our understanding of life in the deep sea were monumental.

Why is no one else shuddering? 

**9:00 pm MST**

As we descended further, shadows seemed to dance just beyond the edge of my vision. I blinked, but they were still there, shifting and curling. I began entering my quarters with slight hesitation. 

I can no longer ignore the creak of the vessel. 

**9:00 pm MST - Audio transcript from Samantha Begardi**

\*sonar beeps faintly\*

Jamieson seems a bit off edge, and I’ve spoken to Matthew, the technician, he just keeps getting the short end of the stick.

\*A voice can be heard from the distance\*

He thinks it’s *my* fault for every sound he hears in this hunk of \^$&#! The guy won’t stop yelling at me every chance he gets. Actually, I would rather he yell than give me that stare of his. Ouff, just makes me want to pull his gray beard right off.

\*Samantha laughs\* 

Keep it professional Matthew! This is an official log. Anyway, we’ve witnessed some insane species down here, it's like, like an alien planet or something. Not to mention oxygen readings are off the chart. Imagine there's a whale down here or something. 

\*a stifled laugh\*

Oh shut up Mansted.

* **Audio over**     -

**9:30 pm MST**

I have ordered the crew to slow travel down to 0.5m/s. I do intend to miss anything or rush past potential findings. 

I have reprimanded the crew for abusing voice logs. Aswell, the biologist seems so content to be using his notebook as opposed to the perfectly fine electronic logbook. He has been reprimanded as well

**9:30 pm MST**

I can almost see the research papers with my name on it. This has become the most fruitful escapade yet, with only minor faults here and there

**9:40 pm MST** 

The deeper we go, the more I feel that we’re crossing a threshold that shouldn’t be crossed. The sonar readings are showing something, but it’s not right. It’s like the ocean itself is moving, breathing. I don't think I can trust the data anymore.

**10:00 pm MST**

The crew has become increasingly suspicious. They give each other little glances when I assert my authority. 

This venture is becoming more bothermore than I thought. 

I’ve let them know we will have a mandatory rest period with the vessel on autopilot going 0.1m/s until 0830. Unbeknownst to them, I’ve disabled communication between them during this time. Before the technician went to his individual dorm, I informed him that when he wakes to cite lack of comms as an issue with the pressure gauge and that he will address it immediately. 

He was informed that any disclosure is a breach of contract.

I do not trust the technician. 

**8:45 am MST**

I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were hiding something from me, or that I was being watched. 

Has the technician exposed me? 

We are reaching 15,000 m, and ever so close to the source of oxygen production. This is a bound for the company. If I could ever find the words to express the greatness we hold in the palm of our hands. Sonar is enticing me, mysterious readings litter the radars. I am so close to uncovering the nest of something beautiful. It's as if a siren is pulling me in closer.  

It seems to be something alive! Something, somewhat, there is a presence in this deep and I will study it. 

**9:00 am MST**

We’re deeper than any man has ever traveled. it’s the feeling, the overwhelming sensation that something is terribly wrong. I see things now, shadows darting just out of sight,I can’t shake the sense that this is just the beginning of something far worse. The cold—god, the cold—it’s more than mental. It’s like it’s inside me, consuming me. I can’t trust the crew. I can’t trust anything. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

**9:15 am MST**

It's some monstrous presence. Dear god–it's beyond comprehension. I am not crazy, these are the crew's words. I will update the log with more information later.

**9:30 am MST**

I have disposed of the technician. 

He breached his contract.

I sent him inside a remote control drone under the guise of exploring an unknown light, then sent him into the gaping mouth of a large lifeform.

He breached his contract.

Even so, that puny man deserved all that was coming to him. He was always a weak link, a liability. Now, nothing stands in the way of greatness. We are on the brink of discovery—no sacrifice is too great.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

The crew reports that the captain has destroyed the keyboard, unable to make electronic logs he resorted to a notebook, which is now lost forever. 

The following audio logs come from the crew, and are those deemed important to your investigation, over 300 logs have been vetted from this folder. They are available upon your request.



**9:40 am MST - Audio transcript from Samantha Begardi**

Matthew’s dead. I don’t mean to sound like such a stone hearted &(@#$, but I will not accept his death till I’ve left this god forsaken ship.

\*sob escapes Samantha’s Lips\*

I didn't even believe in god before this trip…But now… now I’m praying for something, anything, to get me out of here. God, or the devil, I don’t care anymore. Just get me off this ship…



**10:00 am MST - Audio transcript from Deen Casona**

We are doomed to hell. The captain has not washed, slept, or ate for 3 days and counting. 

\*sighs\*

If this is my last log, so be it. 

There is a presence about 1500m below us. A mysterious green light emits in the pitch black. 

I had the steady assumption the crew was overreacting, never been too close to the whole lot anyway, and the readings we were receiving was just a form of dark oxygen. 

This is something inhuman, alien, otherworldly. Whatever other words can even come close to describing it. I know it doesn’t matter. We’re already dead. The B23’s just a coffin now, sinking into hell. And I’m the one who sealed it.

I will hide this information from the rest of the crew, but I've noticed we're beginning to be sucked in. I've turned off all navigational features of the B23.

If the likely scenario becomes the likely scenario, tell my wife I knew about her infidelity. I only took this trip to get enough money to keep the kids with me, and I wish to see her in hell with me. 

 **10:30 am MST - Audio transcript from Oliver Mansted**

I have no clue whose more bonkers Samantha or Captain Pecunia. 

Deen theorized that the light is a gate, or something worse. “Whatever it is, it’s waiting for us. And we’re going to meet it. Maybe it’s better this way. No more lies, no more running.”

That guys )(\*\^#%@ nuts too. 

We are nearing the sea bed. There are Nauftes ships laying waste, emergency flood lights lighting each other up. 

There are maybe 30 or so ships with fronts ripped off, sides torn open, etcetera. 

Something prehistoric, everlasting, and intelligent is sitting at the bottom of the sea. Evolving so quickly it’s already begun luring in humans, and trapping them.

This is Nauftes doing. You all are idiots. 

You’ve given a monster the taste of blood. 

There’s at least four lifeforms down here. 

I know they drove Pecunia crazy.   
  


I know because I heard one laugh through the rader. 

The green light is the size of a semi truck. 

And it multiplied.

The green light is an eye.  

These bastards took me as a joke for trying to lighten the mood.

Now what?

\*A laugh echoes around the console, Oliver’s resolve falters\*

They’re… they’re not like anything we’ve ever seen. The eyes… God, those eyes—they see everything. Every thought, every fear. I swear they know what we’re thinking.

It knows I’m listening. Dear God it know’s I know. 

I should’ve never come here. Should’ve stayed home, where it was safe. God, what have we done? I… I can’t do this anymore.

I can't do this anymore

**10:35 am MST - Audio transcript from Deen Casona**

Our only chance of survival flew off. The thruster is done. I've told Steven to attempt an emergency maneuver but he hasn’t got back to me. 

**10:36 am MST - Audio transcript from Steven Diyaus**

it’s… inside my head. I can’t… I can’t think straight…

I can’t trust.. not a single… one of them. 

\*gaeh\*



**10:40 am MST - Audio transcript from Samantha Begardi**

HE MELTED..

DEEN I SAW HIM MELT… LOOK AT HIS SKELETON IT”S CHARRED..

STEVEN MELTED..

DEEN!

**11:00 am MST - Audio transcript from Jamieson Pecunia**

This is Captain Jamieson Pecunia. 

I am mere moments away from sudden death.

I have been in a period of lucidity as soon as we lacked an escape method. 

I sent two fine men in an escape pod.

I watched two fine men be crushed by an outstanding pressure, and at these depths pressure the pod should've handled with ease.

After witnessing the impossible deaths of multiple on my ship, I've executed all remaining personnel and ready to face the horrors of this world by myself.  

Godspeed. 

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

My heart pumped to some imaginary beat, I could feel it drumming through my ears as I read through the last page of text; “Note: this was the only logbook we’ve ever retrieved from underwater missions. Team A had uploaded said log only seconds before destruction.” 

I smoothed a stack of papers on my desk, stood up, stretched, and began a detailed report to deliver to the Head. I think I’ll resign right after.
