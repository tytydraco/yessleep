Most people labor under the delusion that social work is a calling, something you are born into - a destiny preordained by the virtuosity of one's saintly soul. That has always felt like ten pounds of bullshit in a five-pound bag to me. 

But hey - maybe that's true for some of my colleagues, maybe some of them are saints-in-training, guided solely by the desire to provide philanthropy to the downtrodden. That ain't me though. The job certainly isn't saint-work, either. Saint-work implies that the process is godly and just, which it plain isn't, not on any level. Social work puts you in the trenches, a soldier "fighting the good fight", so to speak. Last time I checked, we didn't send the pope and his bishops, armed to teeth with sharpened crosses and lukewarm holy water, to storm the beaches of Normandy. It's a messy, messy affair - no place for someone who isn't okay getting their hands a little dirty. 

Assisting the desperate puts you in touch with all sorts of heartache, misery, depravity, tragedy, sadism, loneliness - the list could go on, but I don't want to turn this story into *Infinite Jest.* But don't just take my word for it. As a frequenter of the social worker subreddit, I'll direct you fine, upstanding, inquisitive lurkers to this quote posted by a fellow solider a few years back that I made a point of favoriting:

*"Social work is easy ! Just like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, and everything is on fire, because you're in hell"*

But I'm getting off track. Back to the point, you may be asking yourself, why does Corvus do this, if not for good of mankind? Also, what the fuck kind of name is Corvus? No idea about the name, but I got reasons for doing what I do. Two reasons, really. First and foremost, I've been doing this job for what seems like an eternity - started in the early 1990s, well before Monica Lewinsky was a household name. Been doing it so long that it's practically all I know how to do. Secondly, it distracts me. Hell ain't fun but it sure is stimulating, hard to be preoccupied with anything else amidst the brimstone and lake of fire. I don't like to think about my past, too painful. Rather be somewhere else, even if that somewhere is the metaphorical equivalent of the DMV in *Dante's Inferno.* And I'm a bit of a hound dog regarding my caseload - when I'm on the job, I barely feel the need to eat or sleep. I get lost in it, and I've grown fond of that feeling.

And that is what I would have believed, to my last goddamned raspy death rattle, if it weren't for Charlie. 

So I'm sitting at my desk, minding my own business between clients, when I see this young guy walk in the front door of the office a good hundred yards from where I am. A real tall, dark, and handsome type. Medium-length curly brown hair, disheveled to the point that it looks intentional and post-coital. Black blazer, black turtleneck, brown chinos. A comfortable six-foot-two inches. Honestly, I think he caught my eye because of how out of place he looked. Young, attractive, put-together, tall - couldn't imagine what the bastard needed us for. 

And he's over there scanning the room, searching for someone, and I feel pretty confident it's not me 'cause I don't know this Casanova, but then our eyes meet. We're staring at each other, and I can tell he's stopped searching. He starts to make an absolute B-line towards me, and I have no clue what this heat-seeking missile wants, but in social work, you get pretty attuned to the possibility of violence from complete strangers. Maybe this is the angry husband of a domestic abuse victim I tended to. Maybe he's a father that hit his kid so I sicked child protective services on his ass. 

The possibilities are, unfortunately, kind of endless. I clutch a screwdriver under the palm of my right hand and brace myself for the worst. 

As you may be able to discern, I am pretty desensitized to insanity. Not exactly subtextual to this whole thing. But insanity suits me. It takes up a lot of space in my mind and my autonomic nervous system, which is kind of the whole appeal. I've got a lot of repressed traumas I think, a real treasure trove of adverse childhood events that I sometimes can feel rumbling in the back of my skull. I've done an excellent job keeping locked tight, mostly. There is one thing that slipped out, however, and If it weren't important to the rest of this, trust me, I wouldn't even mention it. When I was real young, I almost drowned. I fell right to the bottom of a pool for some reason, no one around to help; who knows where Mommy and Daddy dearest had gotten off to. A lifeguard pulled me up at the last second, just as the thick, murky water began filling my lungs. At least, I think she was a lifeguard; all I remember afterward is the sun in my eyes and being dazed. Don't remember much before or after that, and I don't care to. Can't even go near a pool nowadays, or any body of water for that matter. Over the years, I've gotten a lot of heat about my absolute unwillingness to get help "unpacking" everything. But as far as I'm concerned, the work is all the therapy and medicine I'll ever need. In fact, I've made a point not to see a "professional" about it - never been to a therapist, never been to a doctor. People consider me a "professional"; trust me, being behind that curtain is eye-opening. 

Before I had this job, though, I was living on the streets. Theo, a social worker who was a legend of my office, God rest his soul, found my withered husk one fateful night and offered to help. Over time, I got back on my feet. Thankfully, back in the 90s, you didn't need a master's degree to pursue social work, and a bachelor's degree was pretty easy to fake before the internet. One short year later, I was working alongside my mentor. Best fifteen years of my life. My only regret is not getting closer to him. He was always open and vulnerable with me. The number of times I rejected an invitation for dinner with his wife and family is probably in the triple digits. It just never felt possible. Never felt right. 

So anyway, the stranger gets to my desk, and I am ready for whatever argy-bargy this psychopath has in mind. Instead of trying to wring my neck, the lunatic stops a few feet from me, proceeds to slam a weathered newspaper on my desk, crosses his arms, and then waits impatiently like I'm the one holding *him* up. It takes me a minute to mentally acclimate to this new absurdity and respond. All the while, this maniac is glaring daggers at me, then looking at the paper, then back at me, so on and so forth. Tapping his right foot as if to say: "I'm *waiting, old man*". 

Eventually, I put on my readers to examine the disintegrating parchment, and its a copy of *The New York Times* from the winter of 1993. I bring my gaze back to his, completely befuddled, and in the sweetest, most saccharine voice I can muster in these trying times, I ask him: *"Can you kindly explain to me what the fuck I'm looking at?"*

He rips the paper from my hands, I watch him flip through it, and again, he looks livid with me for not understanding. Finally, he gets to the back of that ancient text and apparently finds what he is looking for, at which point he flips the paper back at me and points to an article circled in blue ink. The column he circled was in the reader-submitted "dating tips" section. And for those of you young enough to be asking - Yes, people used to legitimately look towards the wisdom of other people who would go out of their way to send "dating tips" to a major newspaper. God bless and keep the 90s.

I almost didn't read the title of the article that he circled. I mean, would you have? I don't necessarily seek out opportunities to cameo in *every* schizophrenic crisis playing itself out on the streets of New York. But, hell, maybe I kind of do. Veteran social worker and all that, I mean.

So I looked at the title, and immediately, I recognized the article. It became pretty infamous back when I started out as a social worker, and not because it gave excellent advice on how to pull off an up-do. I still don't know why this silent stranger is presenting me with it, but it did generate a tiny spark of interest, I will say. He had circled the first and only big break in the "Lady Hemlock" ritual killings that terrorized Brooklyn that winter, which was titled:

*"An Occultist's Guide to Love and Loss in the 20th Century"*

For those of you who weren't on the NYPD upwards of thirty years ago, allow me to give you a quick synopsis:

Six unexplained corpses in a little over three months, all killed by a singular puncture wound into the back of neck and out through the front. Two middle-aged men, an elderly couple, a wealthy widowed small business owner, and a rising football star out of one the local high schools. All terrifying, but the kid's death - that was kerosene to the growing wildfire. The people wanted answers, but the police had none to give. This killer was busy, too. A new body had been discovered approximately every two weeks, like clockwork. But the police didn't even know where to begin - the victims were seemingly selected at random: no unifying age, gender, job - really no unifying anything other than the manner of death, at least at first. Eventually, it was discovered at autopsy that each victim had a different shape carved on the *inside* of their skull, right between the eyes. How did the killer do that? Who the fuck knows. If the police had any ideas they sure as shit didn't let the public in on it. If you're an avid fan of *Unsolved Mysteries,* like me, you would eventually learn that experts in the occult couldn't all agree on a particular cultural origin for the strange marks. Or, more hauntingly, how they were seemingly inflicted before death. 

Now mind you, this was at the height of the "satanic panic", so before the words "nordic-looking rune" could even leave the police commissioner's mouth during a press conference, people were raring up for a witch hunt. They needed something to chew on, some piece of evidence to assure them that the authorities were closing in on this killer. Thankfully, some real Sherlock Holmes type in the NYPD noticed something in the paper one day that would give everyone something to think about. About a week before each body was found, a contributor who went by the name "Lady Hemlock" had been published in the "dating tips" section of the New York Times. Now overall, the advice itself was pretty benign. Bizarre, cryptic, and borderline nonsensical, sure - but it wasn't a confession to the crimes or anything. Nothing like "Hi, I'm Jeffery Dahmer, and here are some tricks on how to break the ice on the first date by discussing the benefits of low-income housing". With each article, however, a certain shape would be printed alongside it - shapes that, one week later, would be inscribed on the inside of someone's skull while they were still alive and breathing. 

Thus, the search was on for this "Lady Hemlock." The police initially theorized that she actually worked at the New York Times because it was suspicious that the killer was able to reliably get their articles published ahead of time while still staying on a tight every two-week timetable. No "person of interest" was ever identified in the Times, however, and there was only one more victim, but it was hands down the most confusing and gruesome. All the internal organs of some poor sap were found in a trash can by a local park, and I mean all of them - lungs, colon, liver, spleen - every gross viscera present and accounted for, excluding the brain. None of it belonged to the prior victims or any other corpses that found their way into the morgue in the decades to follow. The murder was determined to be related to "Lady Hemlock" due to a shape carved on the outside of the heart. 

And while that is all very interesting, I still had no idea why this man had preserved the article for three decades to then forcefully shove it under my nose for appraisal. So I asked him again, *"what, dear God, are you trying to tell me?"*. Then began the wild gesticulations that inspired his namesake: he pointed at the paper again, then at him, then at me, then at the paper, then back at him, then back at the paper. We'd come to know him around the office as "Charlie" in an outdated reference to Charlie Chaplin, due to his mute nature and his vigorous pantomiming. At one point, it seemed like he had a flash of euphoria, and he began to take off his blazer and turtleneck - and that is when I decided I had seen enough. 

*"Marco, get this perv out of here !"* I called over to everyone's favorite security guard. We liked him for his work ethic, but we loved him for the beatboxing he did while on shift. 

Kicking and screaming, Charlie was dragged out of our office, Marco throwing the newspaper out after him. In the process, however, a sticky note fell out of the folds onto the entrance mat. He looked at it, read it, and then walked back and handed it to me:

*"What are you doing that for, man?"* I said, wondering why everyone had selected me as their target for unabashed weirdness today.

*"I think it's for you, bud"* Marco replied, still huffing and puffing from the commotion.

The note in my hand said: *"Thanks Corvus. Appreciate the help."*

—-----------

Charlie and his one-man performance would become a regular staple around the office the following month. At first, it was mostly just silly because Charlie never seemed intent on hurting anyone. He just harbored this arcane compulsion to present me with dating advice from a serial killer that, to my knowledge, is still roaming free to this day. But he was never physically aggressive or violent. I offered to help him if he could talk to me or provide some documentation about where he was from, what he was doing here, and what he needed help with, but it always came back to that damn article. Eventually, Charlie needed to find new and creative ways to get the paper to me because security was starting to recognize him on sight: he came to the office early, then he mailed a copy of it to me, then he waited for me to leave, and followed me to my car with it. Why did I never call the cops? Well, as I said, I'm pretty resistant to insanity. As long as it never turned violent, I would wait for Charlie to tire himself out and instead start to badger someone else. 

Over time, though, it transitioned a bit from comedy to tragedy. Every time he came in, he was wearing the same clothes. Then, I noticed he wasn't shaving his beard or showering. Clearly, he was unhoused. I wanted to help him, but he seemed unwilling to accept the type of help I was able to offer. 

One fateful night, I was working late in the office, typing up a case report, when Mr. Chaplin somehow materialized out of thin air in front of me. Scared me halfway to Val Halla. Weakly, he once again handed me that article. I looked up at this odd, frightened-looking man and wondered if this was how Theo felt seeing me for the first time. Whether it was exhaustion, pity, or me channeling my mentor, I relented:

*"Sit down and keep your shirt on."* I grumbled.

He did as he was told, and I once again began to examine that article, "An Occultist's Guide to Love and Loss in the 20th Century." Charlie, for the thousandth time, stared at me and said jack shit. I guessed that he wanted me to read the whole thing while he watched, and there was no way I could have anticipated why at the time. I sighed, turned on a lamp, and began to read the column. Judging by the date, I believe this was the first one printed (i.e., the column that preceded the first victim):

*Dear readers, please spare me a few moments. The world is lost, made blind by circuitry and the advancement of the physical, the material. Yet, in doing so, we are rejecting the immaterial - the omniscient current that ebbs and flows through those favored by The Six-Eyed Crow, our universal mother. And in rejecting the current, what do we have to show for it? A bevy of suitable mates to help carry on the bloodline? The prosperity that cometh with our rightful place in the celestial hierarchy? Dominance and control over those who would suppress the leyline? No, I think not. Yet, in the face of defeat, I remain firm and steadfast. I will continue to preserve the sanctity of the current by performing the old ways.* 

*Grandmother always used to tell me: "Do not take under what is owed to you; compromise is the corruption that pollutes and festers every choice therein". She lived these words, as grandfather was an amalgam, congealed from the essence of the many. Our coven, and even my mother, rejected the practice, the old ways, and questioned the divinity given to us by the universal mother. This rejection did not deter Grandmother. It amplified her gospel. Her sermon only grew louder. It made her a symbol of devotion and, eventually, a martyr.*

*I desired to live her words, and in this, I have succeeded. I have had many an amalgam over the years, but I have yet to achieve the perfection necessary to sire my kin. And because of their imperfection, I have cast them out to wander the mortal plane. Alone, forced to endure divinity unlived in penitent singularity.* 

*But lately, I find myself tormented by my own imperfections. Although I continue to live Grandmother's words, I have not the bravery to spread the gospel openly, which I believe is required to revive our coven. The voice of the current grows quiet among the noise of the world and the voice of my current amalgam. Allow me an opportunity to rectify this error. Hear these words: every soul carries a part of the leyline, however small, and it can be harnessed as a means to draw closer to the universal mother. Follow me, my example, my instruction, and my image, into the next dawn, and witness as I construct a new amalgam, casting aside the defunct and imperfect predecessor. A golem born of a new six: the devotion to adhere, the courage to fight, the desire to take, the wisdom to live, the faith to believe, and the monasticism to remain voiceless and pure.*

*If you follow these words and learn by my example, your ascension is sure to follow."*

When I finished, I noticed Charlie was scribbling something down on a small square of paper. I reached over to take it, assuming it was some explanatory message for why he had been so dead set on me reading this looney nonsense. He raised one index finger to my hand, however, and pushed it back. He then stood up slowly, inhaling, exhaling, and closing his eyes as if to center himself. In one fluid motion, he revealed a pocketknife he had concealed in the breast pocket of his blazer and buried it into his own chest. 

He then dragged the knife up the length of his sternum, smoke and steam rising from the wound that was otherwise completely sterile and bloodless. In stunned horror, I watched him put one hand on either side of the new slit on his chest, pulling and wrenching the tissue agape, only to reveal an empty cavity. He watched me intently while he did so - no pain or discomfort on his face, just despair and longing. 

Before I could react, he drew and arced the knife into the air, then sent it careening down to splinter my chest. I released a bloodcurdling scream, not out of physical agony but out of unbridled existential terror and shock. I couldn't find the will to move as Charlie put his hands through the wound and pulled outward as hard as he possibly could. Nothing. No blood. No pain. Just steam, useless mist rising up and dissipating unceremoniously. I'm just as empty as the nightmare standing before me, I thought. My scream eventually stopped and transitioned more to catatonia as Charlie reached into his pocket and handed me the square of paper to read: 

*"We are kin"*

—----------------------------------

As with every house of cards, you pull one card loose, the damned whole thing comes toppling down. Proverbially, that card usually isn't as extreme as a knife through your chest as a means to reveal a very noticeable vital organ deficiency, but I digress. 

Charlie and I spent the entire night in my office after I recovered from the shock. Through a series of writings, he explained that a "bright, fuzzy light" handed him the old newspaper and the note, at which point he found himself outside my office. The sticky note was also written in a completely different handwriting than Charlie's, so we suppose it was penned by "Lady Hemlock" *("Thanks Corvus. Appreciate the help")*. No memories before all that, though. So, he stood outside the office, read the article a few times, and then wondered what to do next. Took him a while to figure out he was supposed to go inside, knowing he should look for something but not even really knowing what he was looking for. When our eyes met, suddenly, he knew what to do; he was "struck by lightning", according to him. Kin recognizing kin.

In the end, he theorized I was an amalgam like him. I mean, the timeline does add up: I met Theo in '91, got the job in '92, and the killings started in '93 - meaning I would have already been abandoned by the time Charlie was made. Why Lady Hemlock put us together is an entirely separate issue, as it directly contradicts what she said in that article. Maybe she had a change of heart about isolating her so-called imperfect creations. Regardless, the revelation certainly gave my obsession with distraction some new dimensions. Hard to "unpack" your childhood memories if you don't have any. It's probably not a great idea to attend a dinner at your mentor's house and not be able to eat, assuming the food just kind of plops down into some unholy internal nothingness. I may or may not have actually been drinking booze when Theo found me on the street. If I was, I imagine it didn't do a lot other than pickling the inside of my empty abdomen. The weight of it all sometimes overwhelms me to the point of tears; I'm man enough to admit it. 

One day at a time, Charlie tells me (more accurately writes down and hands to me, he still can't talk). He doesn't remember what his name was before, so he still goes by Charlie. We do worry that his appearance portends a new series of "Lady Hemlock" killings as she attempts to create a more perfect amalgam, but we'll cross that strange bridge when the time comes. We've certainly contemplated going to the police, but at the same time, not sure how they will react to the whole "organ deficiency" thing. Both of our chest wounds were healed by the time we left the office in the morning, though, so we're assuming they probably couldn't kill us even if they wanted to.

It's been nice, honestly. Having Charlie, I mean. Whatever we are, we can at least be it together. That counts for something. 

He *will* have to get his master's if he wants to pursue social work, though. It's 2024, after all. Not everyone can be so lucky as to be abhorrently congealed under some godless death ritual in the 90s.
