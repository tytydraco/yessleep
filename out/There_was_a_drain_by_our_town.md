After a lot of thought, I just can’t keep this to myself any longer. Maybe there will be legal repercussions, maybe not. I don’t even know what crime this would’ve counted as. The point is, I can’t keep this to myself, and I no longer know any of the other people from this story, so I can’t talk to them either.

I’ll use initials and try to keep it broad - just in case one of the others finds this, I don’t want to implicate them for something that’s already done. But if any of you are, by chance, reading this - please reach out to me, my DMs are always open.

Back during my childhood, I lived in the Midwest - and that’s as far as I’ll go in terms of sharing my location. Our small town was surrounded by an expanse of farmland, just grassy nothingness in every direction, which our parents let us roam in from a very young age. In retrospect, I don’t know why my mom let me, a 7-year-old, just run wild with the neighbouring kids - sometimes until dark. I guess times were just different back then.

Well, there was a spot outside of town that the kids in my neighbourhood would call ‘Danger Tunnel’, an entrance to some sort of drainage pipe; its infamy was known by pretty much all of us through tales and stories on terrible things that happened in that pipe. We’d often dare one another to go near it or run a few feet in and back out again. Harmless kid stuff. 

Well, sometime in the summer, me and some of the older neighbourhood boys (must’ve been only 11 or 12 years old) decided that we were finally brave enough to go out there and explore the tunnel. Of course we’d never tell our parents this, so we all snuck out what we could from our homes: I brought crank flashlights, B brought his airsoft pistol (for defense) and the two other boys we were with, brothers K and J, raided their pantry for snacks. All equipped, we walked through the bushland for a decent twenty minutes, finally converging on ‘Danger Tunnel.’

Imagine the entrance to a bunker - two slanted walls at an angle, either side of a big flat wall where the door would be. Now, replace that door with a circular shaped set of metal bars with a hinge to open it, and you’d have the entrance to Danger Tunnel. The whole thing was fucking massive, but maybe that’s just because I was probably still four-foot-something. 

We gave out the crank flashlights (one to B, one to me) and, after some convincing, K managed to be the one to hold the little airsoft pistol. We took a decent bit of time trying to get that heavy circular set of bars open enough to crawl through, but we managed. Off into the pipe we went.

The pipe itself was as big as the entrance - pretty needlessly so, actually, I couldn’t really imagine why it was expecting that much runoff, our area only had the occasional summer rainstorm but nothing major enough to warrant Danger Tunnel. All four of us could comfortably walk side-by-side and still leave a gap in the middle, where the smallest trickle of water was going further and further down into the dark. It took me a bit to realise we weren’t walking straight, but at the smallest declining angle down underground.

After taking an L-bend, all the light seemed to drain almost instantly. The tunnel reverberated with the noisy cranks of our flashlights.

There was this tapping sound we started hearing after 10 minutes in the tunnel. 

I couldn’t tell you when it started up, the cranking noises of the lights must’ve masked it. But it was there. A pretty discernable tapping.

K said that it was probably just water dripping somewhere nearby, which kept us from thinking too deeply about it. Apart from me, though. The tapping just didn’t feel as rhythmic as a water drip - it overlapped with itself, came at weird intervals, and yet I felt invincible when surrounded with older kids and didn’t want to be shot down if I said anything. So I didn’t.

It must have been another ten minutes before we neared the end of the tunnel - not to an abrupt stop, but an opening to a chamber (if that’s the right name?)

You could see the faintest trickle of light from the top of this large room where there was an opening to the surface, a grate. It shone down directly over the pit, or reservoir, in the center of the room: a circular opening that stretched out of view where runoff water would’ve been collected. 

I have no fucking clue how drainage systems work.

We walked towards the edge of this opening and B clocked that the tapping sound was coming from inside of it. ‘Well’, we thought, ‘There’s our answer - it’s just water dripping off the edge into the pit below.’

But we all nervously teetered around the edge and, with shaky legs, peered over the ledge and down below. Pitch black. The tapping sound was more of a scratching, actually.

I pushed the crank on the flashlight and a small beam of piss-yellow light went down into that reservoir-pit-thing. 

There was a guy there. A man.

From what I saw, he was either standing or kneeling in gunky still water that was up to his waist. His chest was pressed up against the side wall of the pit and, by the whites of his eyes, I knew he was staring back at us. At me. What got me were his arms. They were raised up against the wall of the reservoir, stretching up toward us. We must’ve been like 30 feet up from him. He was a shadow. I couldn't make out anything else about him.

But his fingers kept moving against the wall. He wasn’t speaking, his mouth wasn’t moving. His legs were underwater, the surface not rippling once. The only thing about him that had any sort of motion were his fingers against the concrete, his fingernails creating that fucking awful sound.

We were kids. We saw a man in shitty water, staring up at us from the dark in a fucking sewer, so we just ran. I remember actually locking up in fear, losing my balance and feeling like I was about to fall down there with him. Thankfully B gave my shoulder a hard pull, hard enough for me to completely drop my light over the edge, and I heard it hit the water with a splash. That noise was the final straw to get us running straight back into that tunnel.

We turned a 20 minute walk into a 10 minute run, stopping only momentarily to catch our breaths before hearing the noise and getting scared again. Finally taking that L-bend back into the light, I remember us all pushing against the opening bars to get back out like our lives fucking depended on it. We didn’t even stop there. We ran until we passed a hill that blocked Danger Tunnel from view.

In the commotion, K had lost the airsoft pistol - and I remember B getting really pissed about it. Which was odd, because all I could think about was that figure. They had some pretty harsh words to say to each-other on the way back and not once did they bring up my missing flashlight.

K’s brother, J, didn’t actually get a look at what was down there. He kept asking the others questions, not turning to me because I, of course, was the small one. I think I was the one that got the proper look and it’s stayed in my head for the better part of two decades. 

Too scared that we’d get in trouble with our parents, none of us notified anybody when we got back to town. I remember being scared to go to the bathroom for weeks afterwards, scared that the man was in the pipes. Little did I know, this fear would be exacerbated when I’d watch IT with my older sister a little later, and it led to a whole headache for my parents with me waking up screaming from nightmares and arguing whenever they asked me to take a bath. 

I don’t know why, I just started thinking back to this memory recently.

Probably because, with the maturity of age, I can’t help but think that man was tapping on the wall because he heard our flashlights in the tunnel - and he was trying to signal us to get help. Maybe he fell. Come to think of it, I don’t even know if I saw any sort of access ladder to get down there. It was dark. Maybe that’s why he wasn’t moving much. Or maybe it was some old guy who decided to play a prank on us by somehow descending down there. But why would he submerge his lower half in filth just to prank a group of preteens?

And what would he have been doing in the tunnels in the first place?

There’s a lot of questions I probably won’t get answers to. I can’t help but feel like our inaction led to a homeless man (or maybe a maintenance guy?) dying a slow death in the bottom of a sewer pipe. All because we were stupid kids and were too scared to speak up.

If any of you guys from the story do find this, again, please reach out. What I hope is that one of you eventually told somebody, hearing that would ease this burden I’m carrying about this all. Is it too late to tell the authorities? If I did learn he died, I don’t even know if I could deal with that.

Thank you Reddit, I needed to get this off my chest.
