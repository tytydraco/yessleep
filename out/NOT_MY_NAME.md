I know this might seem like an odd place to post this, but I need someone to know what I’ve just witnessed. As I write this, I am hiding at my brother’s house. I know my husband Victor doesn’t use any social media – nothing of the sort. It’s as if he’s unaware this place exists. Still, I can’t shake this bad feeling that I won’t stay hidden for long.

I just keep hoping the blow I dealt was enough to *stop him for good*. I never imagined I’d be saying something like that, but I really.. really hope he doesn’t come back after me.

I never thought anything between us would go wrong, especially not today, on our anniversary... I met Victor two years ago at a medical conference, and it’s only been a year since we’ve married.

He’s an accomplished neurosurgeon, and from the moment we started talking, I was *charmed*. There was this strange attraction between us, and I couldn’t help but want to get to know him better. Now I can’t even say his name without feeling a repulsive, cold shiver of disgust and horror. I remember being approached by him, and he went on for minutes about how I reminded him of a certain someone.

*I thought I knew him* – how could I have **missed** the signs? He had nothing unusual to his character before we married. He was confident, well-spoken, intelligent, and had the physique and looks that really attracted me – everything I thought I wanted in a partner. When we clicked, it felt like fate. 

Victor told me *I reminded him of someone he loved and lost* quite often. I didn’t care to ask because at first, I felt flattered; and now this remark of his makes my skin crawl.

In the beginning, everything about us was so natural. We had issues, but none that stopped us from being together. He was so attentive. He bought me gifts – clothes, jewellery and everything he thought I’d love or would look good on me. But *there was something* about the gifts he’d bring – he would get really, really upset if I didn’t appreciate or wear them enough. Not angry – not typical, but *really quiet* and *withdrawn*. It got so intense he would give me the silent treatment for days.

  
His estrangement from me began with little, mistakable things – *he started to get my name wrong,* calling me *“Evelyn”*, instead of *Emma*. When I pointed it out, he smiled and said he liked the name, insisting it suited me better. He even claimed it to be a special nickname, *something just between us*. I didn’t mind at first, and never felt anything special behind the purpose of him doing so.

He then landed into an obsession of making me do things in a certain way. **It never felt right.** Sometimes, he’d ask me to do my hair in a way he’d like, wear a certain set of clothes on a certain day, eat in a specific manner, all of which felt… initially innocent yet increasingly pervasive with each demand he made. 

I couldn’t make anything meaningful of those requests, until one day I stopped listening to him. We got into a huge argument that day, and he really started growing distant. I tried apologizing to him if I hurt his feelings, because I was afraid he didn’t really express much. We happened to patch up again, and he was mature enough to realise he really did become too controlling. *I let it pass.*

I thought, *maybe he was just particular*, or maybe I wasn’t paying enough attention to him. After all, I wanted this to work. **I should have known better.**

I thought he was just.. I don’t like to put it this way, not satisfied with what I offered to him. So I tried being intimate (he never gave any effort) and he always dismissed my approaches – and this was the case even well before we got married. He was always so obsessed with *keeping me “pure”* and saving the bedroom for marriage. 

Now that we are married, and I have seen nothing go in that direction – and I feel a little lost. However this really isn’t a problem for me since I'm not the most physical person either, but yes.. everybody waits for their moment.

He began to sense this, I think - and he had found a new obsession. He often insisted on giving me massages, and at first, I loved the attention – it felt intimate in a way nothing else between us did, aside from our usual kisses. But the more he offered, the more it started to feel strange. I didn’t really get why it had to be so frequent, and why he seemed so focused on my body in that particular way.

**I felt worshipped.**

The oil he used had *a peculiar, woody – almost piny scent* that I could never place. He often said it was something very special he’d brought just for me. Now I cannot stop thinking how all of it was leading to this.

Just when he stopped with his suggestive massages, he took things to another level one night. I haven’t felt so harassed or vulnerable before. I think I am being overly speculative, but let me explain what I thought he was doing.

I often woke up in the middle of the night, with the unsettling feeling of being watched. At first, I thought I was seeing things, but then I’d see Victor standing in the doorway leading to our bedroom. He was completely naked, his tall, muscular silhouette motionless, his eyes *gleaming faintly* as he stared at me, a *wide grin* etched across his face. **It felt predatory, animalistic.** I thought I was overreacting, but this was the first time I began to fear his presence.

**It felt like he had some really interesting plans for me. But sinister ones.**

The first time, I froze, too afraid to move or let him know I was awake. I pretended to be asleep, my breath faint and shallow, desperately wanting him to leave. He eventually did – disappearing into the darkness without a word. When I confronted him the next morning, he brushed it off as me having having a bad dream. *I wanted to believe him, but it happened again.*

This time, he wasn’t just watching. He was murmuring something indistinct under his breath, his lips moving in deliberate ways, like he was chanting something. His hand moved rhythmically near his waist, back and forth - before his privates. I think I heard him moaning, but it also felt like he said something under his heavy breath. I caught some fragments that disturbed me:

***“So perfect… love, … it’s only.. only time.”***

I tried twitching slightly in bed, raising my head a little, making it clear I was awake through a silent cough. His eyes snapped to mine, and the intensity of his gaze was *utterly suffocating*. *It felt like I’d intruded on something deeply private, something very sacred to him.*   
  
**The air felt so thick I could barely catch a breath.**

This behaviour, was coming from a man who had no interest in any of my physical urges. The very thought of us going at it repelled him, so much - it was hard for me to even bring this topic to the table without embarrassing myself. 

**I didn't know what he was saving me for.**

This continued sporadically for about a week. Each night, I was terrified he’d escalate. We didn’t have the habit of cuddling as we slept, so I really could not make out if he was off bed without turning to him. I feared I’d see him stare at me as I slept, or something worse. My imagination ran wild. And then, without any signs, *he stopped.*   
  
**I should have felt relief, but instead, it left me on edge, wondering what he might do next.**

Nothing really disturbed me until early this month. He gave to me a vase – no, a pot as a gift.

*“This is a gift that is very dear to me.”* He said, *“I really want you to know that I love you so, so much. I hope you’ll come to appreciate what I do for you, my love.”*

I didn’t know how to feel. His words seemed heartfelt, but something about the way he handed the pot to me, so reverently, unsettled me.

The pot felt *oddly warm* to the touch as it rested in my hands. He had told me it was filled with “some very precious sand” he had spent time collecting. At first, I thought he was joking, but his expression was completely serious. I don’t know when he’d done this “collecting”, but I think it was at times when either of us was at work, or in separate places, or *during one of his mysterious absences*.

The pot was beautiful on the exterior, adorned with intricate patterns. He said he had scented some of the sand with the smell of daises, a flower we both liked. *However, I couldn’t help but smell a faint, acrid scent emanating from beneath the floral charm.* I placed the pot on the central mantlepiece of our living room, a place he’d often spend his free time.

Then, a week before our anniversary, that was today, he said, *“Evelyn, dear, I need you to do a little something for me.”*

**I suspected it would be one of his quirky requests.**

*“Yes?”*

*“You know how close our first anniversary is. I really want to make this special for us, for you. But for that, I would need you to stay away from the guest room - for the entire week. I’m preparing something.. really special for you.”*

His tone was firm, almost pleading. I thought he was really putting some effort into a surprise - and I wanted to appreciate it, so I said, *“Of course, if you’re so insistent, I’ll stay out of your way.”*

*“Thankyou, dear. I knew you’d listen. I hope you never forget the months of my careful preservation – oh sorry.. perseverance. I really want you to never forget our first anniversary.”*

I really did not know what to expect. The guest room was a place I wouldn't even bother to enter, because of how dull, and how large it was for a guest. I didn't have much to offer, so I never entered it unless I had to run my usual errands. He'd often spend some time there, and as was expected, it was more frequent now than ever before.

Each day of this week at work, I’d often get messages from him, like:

*“I hope you’re excited for what’s to come.”,*

*“I’m almost ready for you ;)”*

*“Just one more day, dear. Can’t wait to see you in the room..”*

And this afternoon, he sent:

**“BE HOME QUICK. TODAY’S THE DAY!”**

It was evident he was really excited, and I tried to not spoil his mood. So I replied, as unassuming as I was,

“I CAN’T WAIT!! :)”

***Little did I know, I wasn’t actually prepared.***

  
He gave me no other *"special"* instructions, so I sprang into my car as soon as I left the hospital (work), and drove home, constantly thinking about the surprise he had readied for me.

As I parked my car in our garage, I stepped out to see that the lights were off, as if the power was out. I could see he placed some candles by the doorstep, and got a new, *"Welcome Home!"* mat. The door was unlocked, so I entered the house with a sense of uneasy awe.

It was drenched in candlelight. There was that same, piny smell from that oil he used previously – but I could feel the faint scent of daisies and lavender fill the air.

The pot sat on the central mantlepiece, casting a shadow on the adjacent wall. The dim orange light from the candles reflected on it in the darkness. *I could however, notice that its lid was slightly open.* 

As I went further in, the door closed in behind me with a jingle of tiny bells adoring its corners. It briefly startled me.

I walked around the living room, seeing rose petals and daisies scattered on the floor. While I liked the sight, I felt something was off. As I bent to pick one flower from the floor to smell it, I heard paced, heavy steps sound the wooden staircase and upper flooring.

Anxious, I gave out a call, *“Victor?”* and instinctively, I was scared. It resurfaced a lot of my childhood, and rather recent fears of the darkness.

**I was starting to not like this.** I felt shaky, but I remembered what Victor had said to me. I thought I should not ruin his efforts, only hoping the surprise he planned for me better be good.

My call was later replied with the faint, yet fast jingling of bells. It was, as I had expected, coming from upstairs.

I slowly ascended the steps to the upper floor of our large house. The path of candles led me to the guest room. It was slightly much brighter than the rest of the rooms.

**The jingling grew louder.**

My heart raced as I walked towards it, the bells like a countdown for what I was about to witness. My gut told me to make a run for it, but I had a hard time acknowledging these thoughts. Perhaps I was too tolerant, too foolish. *I really should have listened to it.*

As I enter the room, I don’t see Victor anywhere near. Something very jarring, however, catches my eye. The bells stop abruptly.

**I see a severed head.** 

A head, of a… woman, who resembled me so closely.. it was hard to believe that.. she was, in fact, once alive. *Maybe, maybe.. she was who Victor had been talking about? The one.. I so closely resembled?*

***Evelyn?***

When I saw her face, I couldn’t place who she was.. until it clicked to me. Maybe, it was Victor’s former wife.. who he had lost.. and was so obsessed and in love with.

He found a resemblance in me. He wanted to bring her back to life.

**And I was the only one who could have made it possible for his crazy mind.**

Her head, was placed on the wooden floor, in the centre of a pentagram.

**A pentagram.. that I think was drawn in blood.**

*I was paralysed at the sight. Was this his surprise?*

I heard the door sound a thud and close shut behind me. Slowly, I turned to see Victor stand with the door behind his back, blocking the exit. The orange light from the candles flickered on his manic face, smeared with ash, undeniably from the pot I saw previously.

He was completely naked again, as if his nudity was a ceremonial necessity, and he held in one of his hands, a rusted, sharp sickle. His eyes bore into mine with sadistic intent.

*“Beautiful, wasn’t she?”* he said, his voice soft yet menacing.

*“Don’t worry, love. I’ll give you your head back soon,”* He grinned, raising the sickle to the level of my neck.

I screamed, *“Victor!? What are you talking about?”*

He stepped closer, his grin widening, *“Hush… dear. This won’t hurt, I promise. And when we’re done giving you your head again, we can finally..”* he trailed off, blushing like a groom at an altar.

It all came to me at once. The gifts, the massages, his controlling, quirky requests, and demands for how I looked and acted – it wasn’t me he loved.

**I wasn’t Emma to him. I was her.** 

***Evelyn.***

*“The pentagram,”* he said with a reverent tone, gesturing to the bloodstained floor, *“An ancient symbol of the Divine Feminine, misunderstood for centuries. But not by me – I do not hold this belief.”*

***“Tonight, dear – we worship her.”*** He announced.

My heart raced as his words sank into my paralysed body. 

**I was his offering.**

He lunged at me, swinging his sickle close to my chest as I backed off. The sharp, rusted edge glinted in the flickers, and I felt the air hiss as it narrowly missed me. My back hit the dresser, and the sound of the gilded trinkets crashing to the floor startled me. *“Running won’t help.”*, he hissed – through his gritted teeth. His wild eyes locked onto mine as he screamed, *“Stop ruining this for me!”*

I didn’t think – I just reacted. I grabbed the nearest object – a heavy candlestick and hurled it at him. It struck his shoulder as he stumbled back and I made a narrow escape, pushing him aside.

I rushed down the staircase, nearly tripping as my feet slid on the polished wood. The sickle clattered behind me, and in a fury of rage, he roared – **“EMMA! YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME!”**

My breath broke into short gasps as I reached the living room. My eyes darted around as he made his way to me. In a rush of cold blood, I grabbed the pot of ashes (likely the cremated remains of Evelyn now that I think of it) and stared at him as he barrelled down the stairs.

He stopped. ***“No.. No.. NO! Emma.. listen, you’re perfect – Don’t you dare!! DON’T!”***

With all the strength I could muster, I flung the pot to his face. It happened to land just below his forehead, striking him with a sickening crack. Down it shattered, and so spilled out the ash and “sand”. He groaned as he fell to the floor like a stiff, wooden doll. The sickle clattered as it hit the floor.

I stood there, frozen, watching as the blood pooled from his head. The acrid-mixed floral scent overwhelmed my senses.

**His body lay motionless. I didn’t want to see if he was incapacitated, or** ***worse.***

I bolted for the garage through the front door, grabbing my keys and any belongings as I ran. My hands fumbled as I unlocked the car door, and threw myself inside, slamming it shut.

The engine came to life, and I reversed out of the driveway without a second thought.

My eyes welled with tears as I sped down the dark road to my brother’s house. I couldn’t think or breathe.

*All I could do was get as far away from that house – and Victor, as possible.*

…

Now I’m here hiding at my brother’s house. I told him everything, **every fucking detail** – watching his face shift from sheer disbelief to horror as I spoke.

I begged him not to answer any calls from Victor if he tried to reach out, and not to let anyone know I’m here.

I can’t shake the feeling that whatever I’ve done is not enough. Now I fear that blow to his head wouldn’t have stopped him for good.

*This fear of darkness I had ever since as a child – has only been encouraged by this persona of his I glanced through.*

I don’t feel like sleeping anymore.

I thought I knew him. 

I thought I understood what love meant.

**But now I feel like I don’t know anything.**

I have not a clue of what will happen next.

All I know is I have to keep hiding.

**And pray that he doesn’t find me.**
