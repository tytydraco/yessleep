**July 2nd: "The Second Night"**

I park in the same spot as last night, under the one flickering light in the otherwise dark lot. The mall looms ahead, a silent monument to something forgotten. I take a deep breath, gripping my notebook before shoving it into my jacket pocket. I’d taken it from the office last night, intending to write down everything from last night when I got home… but things didn’t go as planned. I somehow got home, although I have no recollection of the journey after leaving the mall. I’ve spent the last few hours debating whether I should even return, but like I said, I need the money.  It’s just another shift, I tell myself. Just another quiet night of walking empty halls and checking locked doors.

But the moment I step inside, something feels *off*.

The air is thick, stale, carrying a scent that wasn’t there before, something faintly metallic, like old pennies left in the sun. The silence feels *deeper*, heavier, as if the mall itself is holding its breath. I scan the entrance, the rows of shuttered storefronts, the dead electronic kiosks covered in dust. Everything looks exactly as I left it.

Still, my fingers tighten around my notebook.

I pass the department store where the mannequins stood last night. They’re there again, still as ever, their plastic limbs locked in artificial poses. I don’t stop to look at them this time. I won’t give them that power.

My boots echo against the tiles as I make my way toward the security office. I try to convince myself that tonight will be different, that if I focus on the job, if I write everything down, I can make sense of what happened before. Maybe even prove that nothing *did* happen.

But as I reach the office door and punch in the security code, a single, intrusive thought worms its way into my mind.

*If nothing happened… then why do I feel like something has been waiting for me to come back?*

My pulse is slow and steady, but there’s a cold pressure at the base of my skull, an animal instinct that tells me I’m being watched. I stand still, listening. The air hums with silence. The PA system stays dead, no lingering hiss of static, no hint that it was ever on. Just darkness and the quiet hum of my own breath. I turn back toward the hallway, shaking my head. It’s just the acoustics. An old building full of hollow spaces, the sound bouncing around and distorting itself. That’s all.

But then…

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

Footsteps.

Close.

Not an echo, not mine. Something deliberate. Someone else moving when I’m standing still. I whip around, flashlight cutting through the dark. My beam glides over the tiled floor, across the rows of lifeless storefronts, sweeping past empty chairs and tables. Nothing moves. I hold my breath, straining my ears, but the sound is gone.

It was just my imagination. Just a trick of an old building settling, I tell myself. But when I turn again, my stomach knots. Because the store clock, the one that read 4:02 AM last night, now reads 4:02 AM again.

And my watch?

11:15 PM.

I step back. My fingers tighten around my flashlight. The mall is playing with me.

\*\*\*\*

I grip my pen too tightly as I find an empty page and scribble in the notebook. *Second person on camera. Security guard in old uniform. Heard voice on PA. Footsteps.*

My handwriting is uneven, scrawled in a way that betrays my nerves. I force myself to breathe. I can’t lose control. That’s how fear gets in, how it starts to rot you from the inside out. The mall is playing tricks. That’s all. I shove the notebook back into my pocket and continue my rounds.

The food court is empty, just as I left it, but the air feels different: charged, like right before a storm. I move carefully, scanning every darkened storefront. Then I see something that stops me cold. A tray of food, sitting untouched on one of the tables.

It wasn’t there before.

The burger is still wrapped in wax paper, the fries arranged in a neat little pile. A full drink sits beside it, condensation still fresh on the plastic cup. I step closer, pulse thudding in my ears. The logo on the cup… it’s not right. It’s from a restaurant that hasn’t existed in this mall since the early ‘90s. I reach out and press a finger against the cup. The ice inside shifts, clinking gently. It’s real. Fresh. And then, right behind me…

*SCRAPE.*

A chair moves. I spin, flashlight sweeping over the tables.

Nothing.

The chairs are still. Except for one. It’s pulled back, like someone was just sitting there and stood up. I scan the food court again. I feel it before I see it.

Something watching me.

I snap my head toward the nearest storefront, heart hammering. For a moment, I think I see movement in the glass. A shape shifting behind the display window. But when I focus, there’s nothing. Just a reflection.

Just *me.*

I swallow hard and turn away. I need to check the cameras again. I walk faster than I should back to the security office, gripping my flashlight like a weapon. The moment I step inside, the monitors flicker.

Static. Then…

The food court, live feed.

I see myself, frozen in the frame, standing exactly where I was seconds ago. But there’s something else now. A figure, sitting at the table where the fresh tray of food was left, head  bowed, hands resting on the table. The screen distorts, flickering again. When the image returns, the table is empty. And the tray of food?

Gone.

I run my hand over the cover of an old logbook, feeling the cracks in the old leather. It’s warped from time, the pages inside stiff with age. The mall kept records of its guards, but this isn’t part of the official reports. This is something else. I flip through the pages, scanning the cramped handwriting. Most of it is mundane: notes about trespassers, maintenance requests, the usual. Then, the entries change. The writing grows shakier, more urgent.

*"Night One: Small things. Lights flickering. Thought I heard voices, but the mall creaks a lot at night. It’s probably just the vents."*

*"Night Two: The patterns are becoming clearer. The mall doesn’t sleep when we do."*

*"Saw someone at the food court. Didn’t belong. Uniform was wrong, like from another decade. Checked cameras: nothing there. But I saw my reflection in the glass later. There were two of me."*

I stop breathing. This isn’t possible. I flip through more pages, my pulse hammering. The dates don’t make sense. The ink is old, faded, but the last entry… the last entry is from over thirty years ago.

*"Night Three: The stairwell appeared today. I know it wasn’t there before. The others didn’t see it, but I did. I went down. There was another mall beneath the mall. The food court, the stores—untouched by time. And the people…"*

*"They weren’t people."*

I slam the log shut, my hands trembling.

No.

This is just a prank. Something left behind by a bored employee. Except I know better. I *felt* the difference in the air tonight. I saw the figure in the food court, the old tray of food. The second *me* on the cameras. And now, I know I’m not the first to see these things. I have to get out of here. I turn toward the door… And then the PA system crackles to life. A voice. Low, distorted. Garbled, like a record skipping over itself.

*"D—o—n’t—l—e—ave—"*

I freeze. It’s not just static. It’s a voice. A voice calling to me. The mall doesn’t sleep when we do. I don’t know how I know this, but something tells me…

Neither do they.

My breath is shallow, my pulse hammering against my ribs. I tell myself to turn back, to go up the stairs and walk out of this place, to never return. But I don’t. I step forward. The floor is different here: clean, unscuffed. The tiles haven’t been dulled by decades of footsteps. No dust, no decay. It’s as if this food court never closed, as if it’s been waiting for me.

The smell of food clings to the air, hot pretzels, greasy fries, sweet, artificial cinnamon. My stomach turns. These scents shouldn’t exist in a place abandoned for years. And yet, the trays, scattered across tables, half-eaten meals still on them… look fresh.

My eyes scan the storefronts. "Taco Town," "Great American Pretzel," "Hot Spot Burgers." Logos straight out of another era. They match the old advertisements I saw in the security office, the ones from the ‘80s. The neon signs glow with a faint hum. It shouldn’t be possible. The mall’s power is dead. Then something shifts at the farthest table.

A shadow.

Not a trick of the flickering lights. Not my reflection in the polished tile.

Something *moves.*

It’s not walking. It’s not even standing. It’s *sitting* at one of the tables. I take a step closer. The air changes; it’s warmer, thicker, as if the very space around me is reacting to my presence. I can see it now.

A man.

He sits perfectly still, back straight, hands resting on the table. His uniform is a security guard’s, like mine, but older. Outdated. The patches on his sleeves are sun-faded, the colors drained. He doesn’t react to me.

I swallow hard, my throat dry.

"...Hello?"

No response.

I force myself forward, inch by inch, until I can see his face. Or rather… what’s left of it. His skin is smooth. Too smooth. No wrinkles, no pores, no features. Just a blank, mannequin-like surface where his face should be. A breath of cold air brushes my neck. I spin around.

The tables aren’t empty anymore.

More figures. More people, wearing faded ‘80s fashion, slumped in chairs, standing behind counters. Their clothes hang loose, like the air inside them has gone out. Their faces are *wrong.* Empty. Smooth.

Mannequin faces.

I stagger back. My vision tunnels. The room feels smaller, pressing in, suffocating. And then… The sound of footsteps. Coming down the stairs behind me. Someone is following me. I turn…  And see myself. Stepping off the last stair. My uniform, my stance, my flashlight gripped tight. But its face is blank. The second me tilts its head. Then it takes a step forward.

I *run.*

I don’t look back.

The air thickens, pressing against me as I sprint up the stairs. My legs burn, my breath comes in ragged gasps, but I don’t stop. I *can’t* stop. The walls feel closer. The sound of my own footsteps echoes back at me, distorted, wrong: like there’s a fraction of a second delay, like something else is running just behind me. The stairwell is longer than before. The steps stretch, multiplying beneath my feet. The air smells different: dustier, older, tinged with something faintly metallic.

I reach the top at last, spilling into the back hallway, nearly losing my footing as I slam the heavy metal door behind me. The silence swallows me whole. I brace against the door, my hands shaking. My skin is clammy, my uniform damp with sweat. The mall is deathly quiet. No breathing. No footsteps. No movement. But it’s not over. The air feels *alive*, like the mall itself is awake now, watching me.

The walls seem closer. The floors groan softly, almost like something shifting beneath them. The fluorescent lights overhead buzz and flicker, dimming for half a second before stabilizing. I force myself to move, my legs unsteady. I need to see. I need to know what’s happening. I push through the hallway, past the mannequins in the department store windows. I don’t check if they’ve moved. I already know the answer.

When I reach the security office, I slam the door shut behind me and collapse into the chair. My pulse is a hammer in my throat. The monitors glow in the dim light, stacked four by four, displaying every corner of the mall. My fingers hover over the keyboard. I don’t know what I’m hoping for, proof that I imagined it, maybe. Some kind of rational explanation. But when I flip through the feeds, the cold certainty settles deep in my stomach. The cameras are showing *below.* The food court beneath the food court.

It’s not empty anymore.

Figures sit at the tables, perfectly still. Their clothes are from another time—denim jackets, pastel windbreakers, thick-rimmed glasses. Their faces are blank… but they’re *watching.* Not at the security office. Not at the camera itself. They’re watching something beyond the lens. I click through the feeds, scanning, my fingers twitching. Then… One of them moves. Slowly. Deliberately. It tilts its head toward the camera.

I freeze.

The movement is wrong. Too slow. Too calculated. I lean closer. The figure shifts, turning fully now, lifting its featureless face toward the lens. And I swear… It looks like *me.*

I don’t check the time when I leave. I don’t look back at the mannequins, or the food court, or the cameras. I just get in my car, start the engine, and go. The mall disappears in my rearview mirror, swallowed by the night. The air outside feels thick, humid, but the cold sweat on my back refuses to fade. My hands grip the wheel too tight. Every instinct screams at me to *keep driving*… to *never come back.*

But when I reach into my pocket, my stomach drops.

My notebook is gone.

Instead, my fingers close around something older. Leather-bound. Dusty. The old security log. I don’t remember taking it. With shaking hands, I flip to the last page… the page that held the final, chilling entry from the other guard. The one who wrote about the patterns. About how the mall doesn’t sleep when we do. There wasn’t space for more writing before. But now, the ink is fresh. The pen strokes still wet. A new entry.

*"Night Two. The patterns are becoming clearer. The mall doesn’t sleep when we do.*  
*We never really leave."*

The breath catches in my throat. My pulse hammers in my ears. I tear my eyes away, gripping the log as if it might disappear. Then I notice something else. Something written in the margins, almost like an afterthought. The ink is faded, older than the last entry. Maybe years old. A single sentence, scrawled in unsteady handwriting:

"Check your reflection."

My heart stops.

Slowly, I tilt the rearview mirror. And in the dim glow of the streetlights, I see my reflection. Only… it isn’t looking back at me. It’s watching.

And then…

It smiles.
