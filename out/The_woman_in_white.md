   For some context I’m 17, just finishing up high school. I’m not very popular and have a very small friend group of outcasts. Everyone in it is pretty geeky and nerdy but their nice so who cares. We have get together a where we meet up at the grave yard, which I know sounds pretty weird but it’s quite chill and calming. Nobody is usually there, but every once in a while there will be a family or somebody grieving the lost of a loved one.

   This all started last Monday when I went to the graveyard to chill by myself and listen to music. I grabbed my headphones and headed out. I wasn’t paying attention on my way there, but as I got to my crossing point I realized how quiet it was. There was nobody outside it seemed. No cars on the road, not the sound of birds in the trees, not even the sound of kids playing on the neighborhood playground. I also noticed how foggy it was. Dense fog surrounded everything. I couldn’t see 100 feet in front of me. I brushed it off just as being bad weather causing the seemingly lifeless mood. 

   When I got to the graveyard I was expecting to see somebody there mourning, but again not one person was there. There was a few benches around so I went to my usual spot and took a seat (which happened to be by the entrance),turned some music on, and started doodling in my journal.

   After an hour I figured it was time to go home. I packed my things up and got ready. I got up and looked around. Just out of my view was a figure. I couldn’t  make it out with all of the fog, so I crept up towards it. I thought I was being a weirdo sneaking up on some random person, but as I got up there I noticed her features. She looked like a normal woman I couldn’t tell her height from the fog but she had black hair. Her skin looked pale, almost a very light whitish-grey color, she had a white dress down to her knees, and was wearing a white hat that women wore in the past. She was just standing there, not looking at anything not facing a grave just standing facing one of the walls. I looked to the entrance, she couldn’t have gotten in without me noticing. I looked back and she disappeared. It creeped me out so I just left. 

   I got home and continued my normal routine. I went to bed at around 11:00 pm. I woke up to the sound of tapping on my window, it was still dark out so I couldn’t see much. I was a bit anxious but thought it was just bugs hitting the window. I wanted to check so I grabbed my phone and turned the flashlight on. I looked at the window and nothing. The tapping stopped and I didn’t see anything at the window.

   The next morning I thought that the women probably just walked into the graveyard without me realizing but I still couldn’t figure out how she got out. Despise what happened yesterday I went back to chill again. Today was a lot sunnier and the weather was quite nice. I got there and as I walked in I saw her. This time 40 feet from the entrance just staring as if she was waiting for me. All I could do was stare back, I was paralyzed with fear. Her skin was extremely wrinkled and looked rotten. The smell coming from her was putrid. Her face was rotten as well. She stared at me with a wide uncanny grin, and her nose was pointy and long. I noticed how tall she was. She towered over me had to be at least 7 1/2 feet tall. She stared at me with the most piercing and malicious stare I’ve ever seen. Quickly I turned and ran home locking the door behind me out of fear she followed.

   My mom was at work so I couldn’t tell her what had happened. I went up to my bedroom and scrolled through Reddit to get my mind off of what happened. I heard what sounded like footsteps in the pebbles that covered the garden. I looked out and saw the woman in the garden near my window. I quickly ducked down and ran to my closet, luckily I locked the front door. I quickly started dialing 911 but didn’t get an answer from a dispatcher. But as that thought of locking the front door came back into mind I realized I didn’t lock the back. My heart sunk. As tears flow down my face, I am writing this in the closet and hear the footsteps coming closer and closer to my room.

Edit: y’all this is my first post on this subreddit and I’m blown away from the support I’ve seen THANK YOU!!!
