In the void between stars, a signal sparked. A pulse of electromagnetic waves, broadcast innocently from a small blue planet orbiting an average star. Earth’s first tentative steps into the cosmos, its radio waves rippling outward in every direction for nearly a century, whispering of life.

It was a signal that reached far beyond its intended audience. Beyond the neighboring stars, it pierced the great black ocean of interstellar space. Somewhere, deep within a distant solar system, a listener woke.

*The Yedderal*.

A species ancient and vast, living within a dim system on the edge of the galaxy. For millennia, they had expanded through the cosmos, their knowledge of physics, biology, and time surpassing anything a human mind could imagine. They were survivors of countless cosmic wars, their civilization honed by paranoia and shaped by the cold logic of survival.

When the signal from Earth reached their observatories, it was not met with curiosity or excitement. It was met with dread. A new intelligence, a civilization at the very beginning of its technological ascension. The Yedderal knew that this was how it always began. A new species sends out its first signals, unaware of the predators lurking in the cosmic dark. The cycle repeats: discovery, expansion, and inevitably, war.

But the Yedderal would not allow it. They had learned, long ago, that the only way to ensure survival in a hostile universe was to eliminate threats before they could rise. No negotiations. No mercy.

Inside their vast artificial habitats orbiting their dead star, the Yedderal’s ruling council convened. The analysis was swift: the source was a young civilization. Limited interstellar capabilities. The time window to act was shrinking.

They gave the order: deploy *The Black Seed*.

The Black Seed was a weapon unlike any other. A sphere the size of a human fist, made of a material denser than anything Earth’s science could comprehend, and packed with energy that defied the laws of physics as humanity knew them. It was a bomb designed to end stars.

The seed was launched from the Yedderal’s outermost colony, hurled into the vast emptiness of space. It would travel at unimaginable speeds, using gravitational slingshots around dead planets and black holes, bending spacetime as it went. Its target: Sol, the star of the humans.

On Earth, the day was just like any other. Scientists at observatories tracked routine signals from distant galaxies, mapping the cosmic background radiation. No one was aware of the catastrophe racing toward them.

Months passed. In an underground bunker, a group of SETI scientists detected a strange gravitational anomaly heading towards the solar system. It was unlike anything they had seen. The object moved impossibly fast, not following the natural arcs of planets or comets. It was heading straight for the Sun.

The news spread quickly through the scientific community, but by the time the world's governments were briefed, it was too late. The Black Seed arrived.

When it entered the Sun’s outer layers, it activated. The explosion was not immediate. Instead, the Black Seed began to disrupt the star’s fusion process at a quantum level, spreading an invisible cancer through the very core of the Sun. The star, which had given life to Earth for billions of years, was being rewritten.

Two weeks after the Seed’s arrival, the first signs began to show. Solar flares erupted in violent arcs across the Sun’s surface, far beyond anything seen before. Satellites and space stations were the first to be hit, their electronics fried by the sudden spikes in radiation.

Then the storms reached Earth.

The power grids failed in a matter of hours. Communication systems collapsed. But that was only the beginning. The Sun, once stable and predictable, began to brighten. The heat surged. Within days, the oceans started to evaporate. Crops withered. Entire cities were consumed by wildfires as the temperature soared past survivable levels.

Panic spread. Governments tried to respond, but there was no stopping it. The Sun had become a weapon, and it was dying. So too would everything in its orbit.

In the Yedderal system, the council watched in silence. Their long-range probes confirmed the outcome: the humans would not survive. Another threat extinguished before it could rise.

They had done this countless times before, across countless worlds, each time with the same result. The galaxy was no place for mercy. It was a place of ruthless survival, where only the most prepared civilizations endured.

As they deactivated their monitors, the Yedderal turned their attention to other distant signals, faint echoes of life still too far to be dangerous. But they knew the cycle would continue. New species would rise, send out their signals, unaware of the predators that listened.

And the Yedderal would always be there, ready to strike from the shadows of the stars.
