I always had this weird story I wanted to get off my chest. But until recently I never got a chance to. But anyway, this all happened two years ago one year after my sister died. After I got out of college I needed a place to stay before I could find a job. So I moved back in with my parents.



Now one thing you have to know about my parents is that they own an Airbnb. And they were currently renting my old childhood room to someone who I couldn’t remember what his name was. But anyway I was staying in my recently late sister's old room which had an old pink TV from the 90s if I remember correctly.



Now it felt kinda of sad to see the room was stripped of its girly decor. but the pink TV was still there unplugged. I plugged it in because there was nothing else to do for the day. So I thought that I could watch some reruns of shows I used to watch as a kid to quell the time. So I took out some old VHS tapes including one unlabed from a box hidden under the bed.



But even though I plugged it in and turned it on with the pink remote it would not turn on! I thought that age must have caught up to it so I was a little bummed out. So without anything to do, I went to bed early that day.



As I was sleeping at 3:15 AM I heard the TV bolt-on it woke me up for I was not yet entranced into slumber. And well on the TV, I could see it was playing a video of the room I was in! 



But it wasn’t a prerecorded video it was footage of me in that moment Illuminated only by the glow of the TV. I raised my hand and at that moment, the me on the TV raised their hand!



I was a little taken aback by this but when my alarm clock hit 3:16 AM the TV shut off leaving me back in the dark. The rest of the night was Normal.



When I woke up the next as I was eating breakfast with my mom reminiscing about the old days over some eggs and toast. I told my mom about it. She turned to me once pleasant now cold and in a matter-of-fact voice said



 “stop making things up Matt!”



Before she then left the kitchen to go talk with my dad in the other room. Now although that was an odd response I felt like she was kinda right. I mean I could have just dreamed it. 



But then the next night as I was sleeping at 3:15 AM I heard the TV turn on again. This time however I decided to record this with my phone so I could have some proof about the TV turning on! 



But although I was recording it the Phone could not pick up footage of the TV being on! Even when I turned the Lights on there the phone still showed it as if it was not on! Then as the clock struck 3:15 AM. the TV turned off. So now even more confused than before I turned the TV off and went to bed.



The next day I got out of bed and walked in on my parents talking about the person who was in my room Airbnbing saying odd things like how Cubbey he is and how they need better supplies. But when they saw me they quickly changed the subject and asked how I was doing!



I was going to bring up the TV again but remembered that my mom was upset at me for bringing it up so I decided to keep my mouth shut! After that, I spent most of the day job searching on my laptop. Then at night, I decided to wait for it to become 3:15. And once it did instead of being greeted by the sight of my room. I saw text appear on the TV!



“Matt is that you?” 



I was taken aback by this because how could the TV know my name? But I replied.



“Umm yes.” 



The TV took a moment to respond before saying.



“Are you okay?”



I was confused but said.



 “Yes, I think I am?”



The TV said back to me!



“Could you do something for me?”



I asked back.



“What?”



But by then it was 3:16 so the TV was cut off before it could answer! So once again I was left in the dark with more questions than before. Like how does it know my name, and what does it want?”



But knowing that I’ll have to wait for tomorrow I went to sleep. After waking up the next day I noticed that my Parents seem to not be fully awake! So I asked them what they were up to. My dad told me they were taking care of the Airbnb guy last night before my mom glared at him and he shut up! 



My mom then asked me!



“So when are you moving out son?”



I was taken aback by this! And asked her concernedly!



“Why?” 



My mom then told me in a tired but calm voice!



“Because we will need your room for another client!”



I was a little bit annoyed by this because I had not found a job yet and also wanted to find out more from the TV. So I told them.



“I’m not quite sure yet, to be honest!”



So she told me.



“At the end of the week okay!”



Now because of this deadline, I called a friend who lived a few miles from town to ask if I could stay over till I find a job! They were super chill and said,



 “yeah for as long as you want.”



So for the rest of the day, I packed up some of my things. But unfortunately, because I did not have the strength to finish packing I decided to wait until morning to finish packing. So I went to bed.



At 3:15 the TV turned on I saw the text again saying 



“Are you awake Matt?”



I exhaustedly said back.



“Yeah.”



The TV then said to me



“Remember how I said I wanted you to do something for me?”



I said back with a bit more energy.



“Yeah, what is it?”



The TV then asked me.



“Could you take the unlabeled VHS tape and show it to someone anyone but our parents!”



At that moment when I read “our parents” something just occurred to me. Who is using this TV to talk to me? I then asked the TV one more question.



“Who are you?”



The TV then said to me.



“You don’t remember me!”



It then cut to the video of the same room with me in it only this time it was different! For hanging above me was my sister! She hung like the night she died by what we thought was suicide! She is now above me dead as she was found by my parents! 



I just screamed!



I must have awoken my parents for they were the only ones that came for me! And they were the only ones in that house who heard me scream. They ran into my room yelling.

“Matt, what’s wrong?”



I pointed at the TV showing my dead sister on it they should have seen it! But they didn’t. Instead, they just said to me now angry.



“Why are you screaming at your sister’s old TV it’s not even on!”



They then started to lecture me about how I disturbed them for no reason. But I could not pay attention because the tv was now telling me something.



“If you don’t leave now you’ll end up like me!”



After my parents unplugged the TV and took it out of the room. I now completely unable to fall asleep decided that this was a warning to get out now! So I finished packing up my things and then I remembered to take the unlabeled VHS tape so I grabbed that too.



And ran out of the house to take the nearest bus to my friend’s house! As I was running to the bus stop could see my parents walk into my room holding some rope. 



Luckily I got to my bus in time so for the next few weeks I and my friend would reminisce about our youths and life in general! As I would try to find a job. But then at the beginning of the next week. As I was sleeping my friend woke me up! I asked him.



“Why did you wake me up?”



my friend told me very concerned!



“You the police are here and they want you!”



I was taken aback by this because why would the police want me? But I got out of bed and went to talk with them. One of the officers said to me!



“Are you Matt?”



I told the officer.



“Yes, I am!”



Then the other officer told me.



“We’re here to tell you about your parents!”



I was relieved that it wasn’t me they wanted but concerned as to what they were telling me about my parents. So I asked.



“What for?”



The officer then explained that the guy who was Airbnbing at my parent's house was missing and that they wanted me to tell them what happened at their house when he disappeared! As they were telling me that I thought of the unlabeled VHS tape. Something was telling me to play it.



So I asked the officers if I could do something real quick. So I got the VHS out from my backpack and put it in my friend's old VSR. and for a majored of the tape, it was just old nostalgic memories of me and my sister playing. 



It was honestly hard to watch knowing what happened to her!



Then near the end of it, I saw an odd part it showed her with a distressed look and tone on the night she supposedly killed herself! She was talking into it saying.



“Hello if anyone was watching this I am going to be found dead, I just want you all to know that the people who are about to kill me are my parents! If you find this, please  tell anyone that their Airbnb business is a disguise for them to murder their clients”



Oh my god, I thought they killed her. Then I remembered that my parents had gone back to my room with a rope. That just made me feel even worse! 



Then the tape cuts to a scene of my sister struggling to get herself free from a noose as my Mom berated her calling her a little rat! As my dad was writing the suicide note that we found near her dead body! 



She struggled from 3:15 tile she died at 3:16!
