The first horror film I ever watched was An American Werewolf in London. I remember the transformation scene vividly, and unlike my older cousin who was traumatized by it, I loved it and it got me hooked on the genre. 

  
I eat up everything horror and do everything short of buying the Funko’s, which in my opinion is a waste of money. Back when streaming wasn't a thing, I collected an entire wall full of DVD’s dedicated to horror films. From classics, to foreign to cheese. I couldn't get enough of being scared. 

  
I read that horror stimulates the primitive part of our brain that is hardly ever activated in modern times. Unlike our ancestors we are on the top of the food chain and rarely have to worry about being eaten by sabertooth tigers or being wiped out from the flu. Because of this horror films, video games and even things like roller coasters are used vicariously so we experience the fear of nearly dying but not actually being in any real danger.

  
Haunted houses are a prime example of this. Every year during the halloween season these places become extremely competitive with each other, all trying to be scarier than the others. The problem is that people are sort of desensitized from horror, and it's not just from movies or television, but from the nightly news and social media feeds. Mass shootings, patricide, abduction, natural disasters and so much more.

  
However, for fans of extreme horror, this is a blessing. For people like me, we live for this kind of stuff and will go out of their way to find ones that only allow you to enter if you sign a waiver. 

  
Over the years I found a few like minded people online and became real life friends with them. We have a group chat where we share movie and book recommendations, we called ourselves The Gore Hounds. While we were always communicating, it was during the halloween season that we would share the scariest haunted houses to visit. 

  
Most of the “extreme” haunted houses were not advertised to the public. Most of them were illegally set up to make it feel more dangerous and the really good ones were set up in places that were already creepy and riddled with a sordid past. A hotel where a fire killed dozens of people, a warehouse where a serial killer tortured the homeless, etc… 

  
This year, a member of the group told us about a new place. A place that she claimed would be crowned the best of the haunted houses: Goose Creek Sanitarium.

  
After a quick search online, I found that Goose Creek Sanitarium had a dark history. It was abandoned in the late seventies due to a fire and since then it just sat there, gathering dust and mold. The most recent thing I could find on it was a short article from a small newspaper that said it had been recently purchased. Other than that, there was nothing. 

  
The drive there took a few hours, but we’ve driven more than that over the years in our search for the scariest place. Unfortunately there was little to see on the way there so most of the drive I slept.   
When I woke up it was nearly dark and the car was rocking on a dirt road that hasn’t been maintained for decades. The trees that hugged the road and covered the sky like skeletal fingers looked perfect for a scary movie. 

  
Goose Creek Sanitarium was a large five story building that saw no upkeep in decades. Surrounding it was a black iron fence to keep its patients from getting away. 

  
Very little had to be done to make the place spookier, the people who put it up knew this and didn’t want to ruin it with many decorations. To me this made sense, after all a little salt goes a long way when cooking and too much will spoil the meal. The same is true with decorating a place that is already creepy.

  
The line to get in only had a few people in it. Like us, they were horror connoisseurs. We knew some of them from other extreme haunted houses we visited over the years and this time we invited some of them to be members in our group chat.

  
Like those other places, we had to sign a waiver. This allowed the workers to grab us, pull hair and more. 

  
Getting into the main building required us to walk through a garden that was overgrown with weeds and littered with broken statues of angels that were covered with moss from years of neglect. Like the rest of the place, not much had to be done in order to make it creepy. 

  
Before entering the building one of the workers grabbed Renea, one of the founding members of The Gore Hounds, and ran off with her on his shoulders. This caused everyone to laugh, including Renea as she was being taken further away.

  
“Bring her back when you're done with her” Aaron, Renea’s boyfriend, called out while laughing.   
At the entrance to the building was a so-called “tour guide” who was dressed like a ghoul who just crawled out of a grave. A man wearing a jacket and shorts asked why an extreme haunted house would need a tour guide, but the guide just smiled and said that everything would be explained later in the tour. 

  
He explained the history of the place as he led us through each of the rooms. Most of the rooms didn't have anyone jump out and grab us because they didn't require any. The history of the building was terrifying so it did not need to resort to embellishment. 

  
Not only were the mentally ill treated like animals here, but Goose Creek Sanitarium also housed people with tuberculosis and they were equally mistreated. Whenever someone died, they were brought to the basement's crematorium by being dropped down a dumbwaiter made for corpses.   
According to the guide the smoke stacks that were connected to the crematorium in the basement would have to be cleaned out every month because the remains would stick to the wall. That job was given to one of the other inmates because of how damaging it was to peoples lungs. If someone died while doing it, they would simply be added to the chimney's ashes. 

  
While others in the group thought the story was bullshit, I believed every word of it because of the horrible things I discovered online about the place. 

  
After this introduction, we headed to the cells. As soon as we left the lobby, iron bars in the doorway dropped. Preventing us from leaving that way. The sound of the heavy metallic clang was deafening and caused us all to nearly shit ourselves.

  
The guide chuckled. “When Goose Creek Sanitarium was first constructed, the biggest fear was that someone would escape. That is why there are bars in each of the doorways and windows.”

  
That wasn't in anything I read while doing my research on the place, but it sort of made sense. After all, this place used to house the worst criminals and lunatics the state had to offer.

  
In the cells, people were reaching out to us on both sides of the hallway, moaning and screaming. Some pulled us towards them and we would do our best to avoid their hands or just slapped them away. While this was going on the guide told us about some of the famous murderers who once lived there. The most famous of them was Solomon Gidien, who killed thirteen people in a two day span. He called Goose Creek Sanitarium home for ten years before the mysterious fire that caused the place to close down allowed him to escape. Where he went is still a mystery.

  
I could talk for days about Solomon Gidien, but that's a story for another day. 

  
While being told all of this, a man wearing a dirty surgical mask came out of one of the hallways, grabbed someone I didn't get the name of by the hair and dragged him away. 

  
The man being dragged away tried to fight him off, but the masked man not only had the element of surprise, but was also very physically imposing. Because of this no one stepped in to help. All we did was look on helplessly. 

  
We all signed up for this. 

  
As we left the cells, more bars fell, preventing us from leaving the way we came.

  
Deeper into the bowels of the sanitarium, we came across what I assumed used to be the mess hall. When we walked in, it seemed to me that the inmates had taken control of the asylum. Hanging from the ceiling was wet meat hanging from hooks and cages. Inside the cages were people begging for our help. 

  
The guide spoke over their cries and told us more about the history of the place. How the doctors were known to perform experimental surgeries and procedures. When someone in the group asked if they meant frontal lobotomies, the guide smiled and said while those did happen in Goose Creek Sanitarium, there were far worse fates. 

  
“Rooms were constructed with the sole purpose of driving insane men sane. The idea was that if something could make a sane man insane, it could have the opposite effect. This included flashing lights, prolonged darkness, sensory deprivation, being wet, cold, hot. The people who had to endure this were even starved” the guide said as we left. 

  
Again, more bars fell down preventing our escape and I would be lying if I said that I wasn't scared by this. 

  
Our next stop was one of the operation rooms where blood was splattered around making the place look and smell more like a charnel house than a hospital. I didn't think much of this. After all, it isn't uncommon for extreme haunted houses to use ground beef and the blood that comes with it as decoration. 

  
The guide told us to look around and that we would meet back up at surgery room three in thirty minutes. We stayed in small groups and wandered around a little, all the while having our hair and clothes pulled by people wanting to be freed. 

  
“Their makeup is Hollywood level” Andrew said, pointing out someone who looked to have been a captive for weeks. She was so thin that I assumed that she was a recovering drug addict or a method actor and her dirty white dress highlighted the fact that she was as pale as a ghost. 

  
The more we explored, the less we saw the other groups that were with us. Occasionally we heard screaming but we couldn't be certain that it came from them or the actors locked away in their cells or tied to steel gurneys. 

  
After twenty or so minutes went by, I noticed that the guide was nowhere in sight. I was concerned about this, but the rest of the people in my group assumed it was just part of the show.   
“He abandoned us so we would have to escape on our own” Aaron said as he started making his way back the way we came, forgetting about the iron bars. 

  
Making our way back to where we last saw the guide, we looked for an escape route. At the time we were relieved, after all up to this point it wasn't overly scary. Now that we were left to find our own way out, we felt that it was about to get good. 

  
We spread out to look for a way out, but kept close enough to each other so we could hear if one of us called out. After a while I came across a dark hallway that had six different directions to go, including the way I came from. Calling out to the rest of the Gore Hounds, we met in the grand intersection of hallways. Some of us wondered why the hallway was designed like that, but Andrew was quick to scout ahead to find a way out.

  
Before he could open the door at the end of the hallway he chose at random, one of the women from the other group barreled past that door and ran by us. She didn't even try to stop or to explain herself and the look on her face was pure horror. 

  
Under usual circumstances, we would have followed her just as quickly, but we came here to get scared, so we went in the direction she came from. After all, we had to know what made her freak out like that.

  
We couldn't see much in that dark room, but there was an echo and the floor was sticky. Somewhere close was the sound of shallow gasps.

  
We had to feel around to navigate our way through. On the way we got separated, made worse when some of the actors came into the room with night vision goggles and took some of our hands as if they were in our group and led us away from the others and the exit. 

  
By the time the few of us discovered that half of The Gore Hounds were no longer with the rest, we were in the next room, a surgery room made to host an audience. The smell of fresh blood was unmistakable. In the middle of the room was the body of one of the people in the other group. She was tied to the operating table and the surgeon who appeared earlier in the cells was standing over her. 

  
Some of us freaked out when we saw this, but Debby assured us that it was all part of the show. That we were looking at a dummy and the person we met in line was a plant to make the experience feel real. 

  
As she said this, I inwardly applauded. We all had experienced extreme horror houses before but we never came across anything like that before. 

  
In the distance there was the sound of someone yelling orders in a bullhorn. “Stay where you are”, “Don’t come any closer” and more. There were even a few gun shots. 

  
We all froze, wondering if this was part of the show too. If it was, it didn't fit the rest of the experience.  
The surgeon aimed his scalpel at us and warned us not to move before running out the door, towards the shooting. Naturally I didn't listen and went to look out into the hallway.

  
I thought this was all just part of the show, however when the surgeon started stabbing the officers before getting gunned downI knew it was real. 

  
After the raid and the police took everyones statements, we were let go. They promised to do all they could to find Renea and the others that went missing, but after two years we don't have much hope in finding them alive. 

  
In the days that followed, details of what happened emerged. In the ten days the haunted house was up, thirty six people went missing and at least fourteen were murdered. 

  
The man responsible for the haunted house was best friends with a shady prison warden. The two of them had a deal that the warden would supply prisoners (to make the horror experience “authentic”) for an unspecified amount of cash. 

  
Those acquired from the prison included eight murderers and ten violent offenders. The worst of it though, was a known cult leader who would dine on the blood of his sacrifices and must have recruited the others. Why this person ever saw the light of day is a mystery to me. 

  
Seven of these people were killed in the raid, the rest are among the missing, including the man who paid off that warden. 

  
Aaron killed himself a few weeks after that night, I think he blamed himself for laughing as they took Renea. The Gore Hounds broke up soon after that, nothing officially, its just that we no longer update each other on horror movies or other haunted houses. 

  
I sort of talk to Debby, but never about anything horror related. Most of the time when we hang out we silently fish and or drink.

  
I can't speak for the others, but I cannot bring myself to watch horror anymore and got rid of my horror [collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/).
