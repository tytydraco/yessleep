I am a murderer.

Well, sort of. 

It’s weird seeing reality for what it really is—even if it’s in splinters which don’t seem real. For months, I had been blissfully unaware of my second existence, and the family I had found myself part of. But I was never allowed to fully see it. 

And now that I had glimpsed it, or at least pieces of it,  I wanted to stay in the world where I was ignorant and peered through rose tinted glasses, submitting to the bleeding darkness rotting my thoughts. Where I went to class, drank Starbucks with Nona, and pushed myself to the very back of my mind.  

[It told me not to look.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zvvslb/two_months_ago_someone_was_kidnapping_the_writers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

It told me to never look because what I would see would wake me up. Never find the corner of your eye. Never find me. That is what it told me. And if I did, if I peered into the abyss, I had seconds to look away before it swallowed me whole.

But in those bursts of clarity, I realised that I was splitting in half. No. I was already halved. I was already broken into two pieces. And one of those pieces was so far out of reach, a shadow of myself sharing who I was. Body and mind. Now that I was partially aware of this shadow, I saw her in glimpses. I saw what she was seeing.  

Images came like a flickering VCR. I could hold onto them as long as I closed my eyes and breathed in deep, wrangling these memories which had been shoved back. They caused pain.

They made me bleed from my nose. 

But I had to see them. I had to see my reality for what it was. A room resembling a cave.  Sharp edged ceiling. Walls spattered a deep, intense red which took her breath away—and a slithering darkness spider webbing across tough brick. It acted like mould, like a living thing, sprouting from walls made of crumbling rock.  She wasn’t alone. Four shadows surrounded her. Three of them matched her, while another towered over them. Far bigger. 

Older.

There was something wet clenched in her fist. It was wet and warm, trickling through her fingers and staining the palms of her hands.

“Did we do it?”

Her words came out in sharp breaths. She squeezed the wet thing tighter until it was coming apart between her fist.

The others were silent, but she continued, her tone darkening. Impatience. I felt it creeping up on her. Doubt.

Seconds passed. They felt like minutes. She stared into the dark, and it stared back. Three pairs of eyes found hers, while the looming larger figure cleared their throat. “Try again.”

The man’s voice was disembodied with enough static to tear away an identity. My shadow opened her mouth to speak, to try it again. 

She licked her lips, her tongue in knots. Before it came. I’m not sure how. The image is not completely clear. I just know what one minute my shadow was glaring at the ground with her arms folded, ready to blame anyone and everyone in  the circle—and then something was happening. And that something was bubbling and brewing, spouting from the floor. Like the mould which crawled up brick. But fresh. It ran in rivers like blood, surrounding them. And I felt her delight. The ignition of joy they all shared. Synergy. 

What she was supposed to feel with her writing class, she finally felt with them. 

The darkness was at their feet. It bled from the ceiling and the floor, creeping up legs and twining around her waists, tendrils with needle-like points protruding into the back of her head and entwining around her spine and cracking into skulls, wrapping itself around minds choked with fog. They welcomed it. She welcomed it. I felt igniting pain when it filled her, bleeding into her being—her lips opening in a soft O. But she didn’t feel agony, or fear. Instead, my shadow revelled in unimaginable pleasure which sent her to her knees begging for more. It liked that. It liked that she was begging, pleading for it to go further. Deeper. Until it was rooted deeply inside her skull, already leeching itself onto her soul.

Splitting her in half.

The others followed her, falling like dominoes. Exhales of breath tangled in intoxication.  Sharp. Cutting.

“Miss Hughes?”

The receptionist’s voice was a southern drawl. Friendly enough. It tore me from another splinter of what I had pushed deep down.

Do you know hard it is to turn yourself in for kidnap and murder?

I’ve seen it on cop shows. I don’t know, I guess I figured these criminals had no emotion. No empathy.

So, they didn’t give a shit.

Blinking rapidly, two different realities contorted into each other. I wasn’t sure which was real. Which one was mine?

Was it the room filled with shadows, strangers with no faces? Or the sheriff’s office. 

Wide windows I was sitting next to, a ceiling fan which hummed lightly, and the very faint smell of ramen twisting my gut into knots. Who knows. In my mind, both were as real as each other. While I was Alice, tumbling down that rabbit hole. Plunging further and further into insanity—or perhaps an insanity which was always inside me.  I did know one thing for sure. 

Jumping up, I grabbed my bag. I was shaking. I couldn’t stop fucking shaking. I didn’t know what to do with my hands.

Did I fold them across my chest or let them hang? Did I try and hide them under my jacket sleeves or stuff them in my pockets? 

So many questions buzzing around my brain. I already knew what I was going to tell the sheriff’s office. But I wasn’t sure how. I had been sitting on a not so comfy bench for what felt like hours, rehearsing what I was going to say. Maybe the receptionist knew that. Maybe she had a good eye and could see Kenji’s blood staining the tips of my fingers and tingling my jacket sleeve. I couldn’t get it off. 

No amount of soap and water and scrubbing could get it off. The receptionist was giving me an odd look. I wasn’t surprised. I could barely stand still, my breaths coming out in sharp pants I had to hide between clenched teeth. I had already told her my name was Cassie Hughes, and I needed to talk to someone—but every time someone came up to me, I seized up. I couldn’t breathe. My tongue was in knots. Alphabet soup at the back of my throat. “Miss Hughes,” The receptionist cleared her throat, offering me a smile which matched her friendly trill. 

“Are you alright?”

Her gaze flicked to my right sleeve, and my heart dove into my throat. She knew. I could tell. I could tell by the look on her face.

She knew what I had done to him.

Suddenly, it was so easy to say it. Now that I had exposed myself, exposed what covered me, painted me—fucking stained my skin. I had no reason to hide anymore. My eyes filled with tears, and I was wondering how. How could I feel sad? How could I possibly have empathy when I was covered in my classmate’s remains? 

It was still warm. Dried, but warm. It still felt like it was alive. I remembered how it felt slick on the palms of my hands and running down my wrists. I remember it staining my lips. “I want to turn myself in.” I managed to choke out. There was a beat, and I gave up and folded my arms tightly across my chest. I wanted to hide Kenji. 

Even if I had already exposed it, I wanted to hide what was left of him.

The receptionist’s demeanour abruptly changed. She stiffened up, her eyes darkening. “Calm down.” She said softly. I almost laughed when she handed me a handkerchief. No, I did laugh. And then I wondered if it would scrub off intense, stubborn red.  “Turn yourself in for what?”

How would she say it? I wondered how my shadow would admit to her—our—crimes.

It’s funny. I said it like a joke. I was laughing, but it was more of a sob I was muffling with my sleeves. I wondered why I felt emotion. I didn’t deserve emotion. I didn’t deserve to cry. 

So, I got a hold of myself. I dropped my arms to my sides and heaved in a breath. My shadow never felt for what she had done. She drew blood like it was child’s play, revelling in the pleasure of bleeding mortality and the darkness wrapped around her. Around them. There was only one way to stop her, to stop whatever this was from continuing—and that resolution was to hand myself in. I’m not sure how I said it.

I must have waited a long time, playing with the words in my mouth, seeing how they would taste and feel on my tongue. They felt foreign. Because they weren’t mine. They were hers. “For the kidnap and…and murder of my five classmates.”

I waited for her reaction, but she didn’t have one. So, I continued. With bile creeping its way up my throat, I named them in a singular breath.

“Rowan Carlisle, Imogen Rode, Tao Aster, Eleanor Martinez, and…” I drifted off, my voice breaking out into a shattered sob.

Fuck. With quivering fingers, I feverishly pulled my sleeves over blood soaked hands, sniffling, and snottering, and wondering why the fuck I felt like this. I didn’t deserve those tears. I didn’t deserve an aching chest and twisting gut. 

Stop being sad! I wanted to scream at myself.

Why are you sad? Are you sociopathic? 

Are you just… copying emotions? 

Mimicking tears? I thought back to Eleanor. 

Maybe I had subconsciously drank in exactly how she reacted to trauma and pain. 

Was I perfectly copying her freak out?  

Why was I so fucking sad?!  

I wasn’t allowed to cry over my stained skin. I wasn’t allowed to break apart and say his name over and over again until my chest was heaving. The urge, my god, the urge to slam my fist into my head repeatedly— it was overwhelming. Like a drug injected directly into my veins. Ignoring the voice inside my head, I kept going, squeezing the edges of her desk like it was my own personal anchor. “Kenji Cato.”

Several hours earlier, I was on the way to my parents’ summer cabin with enough hope and denial to fill my emptying tank. I was aware of the blinking red light signalling I was running out of gas, but I was almost there. Just a little more. 

Squeezing the steering wheel, I stamped on the gas. It was cold. Fucking cold. The kind of cutting cold which sliced into the back of my neck, sharp needles protruding into my flesh. 

But this cold was good. This cold was a distraction to what I was doing. 

Winding down the window, I laughed into a particularly ice-cold gust, and I didn’t feel any better. So I laughed again. And this time I got an answer in the form of a loud bang coming from the trunk. Kenji was being unnecessarily difficult. However, I could see why he was being an asshole. I had thrown him in the back of my car after promising to let him go. But he didn’t know how important his presence was. Kenji Cato was the fourth writer to be taken and had been stuffed into my trunk. 

According to the guy himself, I was his kidnapper. But I wasn’t working alone. And along with my fellow partners in crime shrouded in anonymity, I had tied him up, stuffed his mouth with prunes and covered him with embalming fluid, with his apparent fate being my parents’ summer cabin in the woods. 

I wanted to call him crazy. I wanted to tell him there was no way I was involved. But there was solid evidence showing I was. Eleanor Martinez’s sleeve stuffed under my pillow, and incredibly incriminating evidence showing me driving towards the apparent scene of the crime. I had two choices. 

I could either let him go and get myself arrested, or keep him for… investigative purposes. Kenji was the only one who knew who Brontë was. He was perhaps the only lead to what the fuck was going on with me—and where the missing writers were. So, yes. I understood why he was making as much noise as possible, muffle-screaming over my Spotify playlist. But I was also aware of cop cars passing and had found myself contemplating knocking him out. Morally wrong, yes. 

But.. helpful.

“Mpphmmphh!” Kenji’s muffling was getting progressively more aggravating when it was cutting into my lo-fi tunes.

Thank god my parents decided they wanted some semblance of privacy. We were in the middle of nowhere, driving down a particularly bendy road. It was nice scenery. 

If I wasn’t in that situation I might have pulled out my phone and took a photo. Instead, I gripped the wheel tighter with one hand, and with the other I thwacked the passenger seat in what I hoped would come across as threatening and intimidating.

“Kenji. Stop.” 

Speaking through my teeth, I didn’t mean to sound so pathetic. I was aware of my twisting gut and aching chest. Keeping my eyes on the road, I fought against finding the corner of my eye. Where I knew it would be waiting for me. Waiting to tell me to turn back. Ignore. 

I could already feel it, wet slithering darkness crawling up my leg and suffocating my mouth and nose. It smelled rancid, a mixture of rot and mould, and the chemical covering my classmate. But it was also another flash of what I wasn’t allowed to see—a glimpse into why exactly it was there, and why Kenji Cato was stuffed into my trunk. Why three other writers in my class had been kidnapped and whisked into oblivion.

Look away.

I did, and thankfully, the bleeding tendrils let go of my legs. I reached out and tried to grab something tangible, but there was nothing.

“Mpphmmphh!”

Kenji wasn’t helping. If I thought he was actually going to tell me what was going on, I was a naïve fucking idiot.

“I’m going to let you go.” I hissed out. And when he answered with an equally annoying muffled cry, I hit the seat again.

This time my words emphasised each feverish slam. I didn’t realise how dusty my seats were until the air was sparkling, and my gaze was catching something poking from the compartment. Look away. The voice was louder, more scathing. Submitting to the voice, I turned my gaze to the road, and thwacked the seat again. Harder. “I. Said. I’m. Going. To. Let. You. Go!” I yelled. “Just stop, okay? Kenji, stop!”

 Silence.

The sounds of shuffling.

“You want to know what happened to Rowan, right?” I choked out. “Imogen and Tao?” I was less enthusiastic with Eleanor’s name.

“We’re going to find out where they are!”

“Mpphmm?” I had grown so used to his muffling in the short time we had been forced together, it had almost become comprehensible.

Really? I translated his sarcastic laugh.

“Mpphmmpmphmmhpph.”

Are you fucking serious? You’re crazy!

“Mpphmmphmmmmmhmmphmmmhppmh.”

You’re going to jail, Cassie. I hope you like prison food!

I thought he’d stopped after a while of shuffling and the occasional loud bang, which I secretly hoped meant he’d managed to knock himself out. For one glorious moment there was only the sound of my Spotify playlist, and my own heavy breaths. Before he started all over again, and I ended up ignoring him. But it didn’t stop my anxiety shooting through the roof every time a cop car appeared behind us. 

Thankfully, though, I managed to find my parents’ summer cabin, which was tucked into a clearing in the middle of the wood at the edge of town. The feeling of dread began to uncoil in my gut when I jumped out of my car and breathed in the thick smell of mildew and soil.

I should have been hit with nostalgia. Memories of running around with my siblings, having picnics in the dirt and playing on the tire swing dad had made for us. Instead, though, I found myself being hit with memories of crunching leaves beneath four separate pairs of shoes—and a squirming body being dragged in dirt. 

If I concentrated, I could feel something wet on the palms of my hands, stringy rope dangling from my hands. Low voices. Someone kicked the squirming figure, a strong pair of hands lifting the lump into their arms, slinging them over their shoulder. 

My gaze went to a nearby tree. I could see traces of deep red, ancient symbols carved with fingernails shaved to bloody stubs.

Slowly, I was making my way over to the tree in long strides, my breath in my throat. I couldn’t breathe. Bird song which had one sounded beautiful to a younger me, suddenly sounded deafening. My legs felt like they were going to give-way, and I felt it again. I felt… him. He was there, tangling around my legs and creeping up my body, winding himself around my being, sticking needle-like tendrils inside my skull.

They perforated, and I screamed.

Whether it was pain or pleasure, I wasn’t sure.

Risking a glance, I turned. Slowly. Ever so slowly. Until I could see him—it—hanging in my peripheral. Inky darkness fraying my vision.

I wanted to look further.

To find it.

Before a bang, which tore me from reverie. More muffled screaming. This time it was less of a frustrated yell. It was scared.

Hyperventilating. 

Kenji knew we had arrived. The cabin was just a few feet away, hidden behind a crumbling brick wall. It used to stand tall when I was  a kid. 

Now it was a shell of its former glory, battered by seasonal elements. Taking in deep breaths and forcing myself to stay calm, I strode over to the trunk and yanked it open—and the first thing I saw was a blooming red bruise in the middle of Kenji’s forehead. So he had smashed his head on something. My guess was some old piping I’d pulled from the engine. 

The guy was startled, shuffling back, his eyes wide. They flicked from me to the expanse of green surrounding us. I already knew what he was thinking. Kenji was a writer. Best known in our class for his horror. This was the perfect place to kill, and then hide a body. To reassure him, I raised my arms in what I hoped looked like surrender.

“I’m not going to kill you. ” I said. When I reached forward to grasp hold of him to pull him out of the trunk, he squirmed, shuffling back.

“I’ll prove it.”

He raised his brow, still on edge. I could see him desperately trying to pull apart his restraints.

“Are you going to scream?” I asked him.

Kenji seemed to contemplate his answer before shaking his head with an eye-roll. Which was not the attitude I was expecting.

I nodded, ripping off the tape. He still smelled of that chemical. It was a lot stronger mixing with the stink of BO and axe spray.

“Ow!” He spat, shooting me a glare. “That fucking hurt!”

I didn’t understand how he expected me to rip duct tape from his mouth and nose without it being painful.

“I hate you.” He said with enough gusto and saliva frothing on his lips to mean it. “You’re going to jail for a long fucking time.”

It was nice he was finally revealing his true feelings. I knew the smile he shot me in class was fake.

“As you keep saying,” I said. “And for the record? I’m not exactly gung-ho about you either.”

To my surprise, Kenji didn’t speak for a moment. His eyes wandered past me, settling on deep greenery and woodland. He stayed on his knees, seemingly deep in thought. Looking back, I think he was in shock. I think he was wondering if those woods would be his final resting place. 

Kenji was a writer, so maybe he thought like one. Maybe he was subconsciously drinking in the scenery, already carving out his own fantasy world. Probably not. From the look on his face, he looked like he’d given up. Like he was ready for me to kill him and had accepted his fate. Despite me making it clear repeatedly that I had no intention of hurting him. I thought about speaking to the boy, before my gaze found the strip of duct tape hanging from my fingers. It was stained deep, dark red. Polluted and sticky with blood. I hadn’t been focusing on Kenji’s mouth and chin. 

The Looney Tunes like bruise the size of the grand canyon sprouting from his forehead was distracting. But then I was looking at the state of him, at dried splatters running down his lips and chin. Fuck. I couldn’t resist reaching out and grasping his chin.

“What happened?” I found myself saying. And then I was voicing questions I’d totally forgotten about. It definitely wasn’t normal to randomly start spitting out spattered red. Kenji didn’t shake me off. His eyes narrowed into slits. “I have no fucking idea,” he said. “Why don’t you ask Bronte?”

I ignored that.

“You’re bleeding.” I pointed out the obvious. “You’re bleeding bad. I mean… did someone give you something?”

Poison? I thought. Maybe. But wouldn’t that have killed him by now? Besides, I doubt they sold sparkling cyanide at Walmart.

My classmate rolled his shoulders, wincing. “How about this?” He said. “You untie me, and I’ll tell you what you crazy fucks did last night.”

“You’re speaking in plural.”

He raised a brow. “Did you skip basic English? Do you know what plural means?”

“Yes.” I seethed. “You keep implying there are more of….” I choked on my own words, remembering shatters of a memory.

Four pairs of footsteps.

“Us.”

Kenji nodded. “Well, I’ve lost all the feeling in my arms and I’m baring shit up. I think I deserve some leeway. Untie me, and I’ll tell you.”

I didn’t move. “You’ll run away.”

“In my state? Really?”  Kenji leaned forward and coughed right in my face. Something wet hit my cheeks, and I inwardly squirmed. The blood barely fazed him, trickling down his chin. He licked pooling red on the corner of his lip with a sharp flick of his tongue, like he was making some kind of statement. This guy was had internal fucking bleeding and was somehow the one in control. “Even you’re not that stupid.”

He was right. There was no way he was going to start sprinting once I untied him. But I was also paranoid he was someone faking it.

“I’m not untying you.” I said. “But. I won’t gag you again. If you’re…” I flinched every time my eyes happened to find the state of his lips and chin. He looked like a fucking vampire. I grabbed hold of his arms and yanked him from the trunk, settling him on the ground, helping him stand when he swayed off balance.

Immediately, in pure Kenji fashion, he started struggling violently, hissing when the rope cinching his wrists together didn’t shift.  “Calm down.” I said. “If you’re barfing blood, then I want to keep an eye on you. You know, if it happens again.”

Kenji actually laughed. 

A throw-your-head-back laugh which boiled my blood. He attempted to pull away, and I dragged him back. “Oh, wow, thank you so much!” He gushed, stumbling almost drunkenly.  “Really. I am truly fucking grateful you’re nice enough to make sure I don’t barf up my internal organs.” 

Kenji didn’t stop there. Being the drama queen he was, he mockingly dropped to his knees and bowed his head, spluttering on another cough or laugh. “My liege.” He choked. “Thank you for doing the bare minimum. Really. I am truly fucking grateful.”

I found myself smiling. Maybe I was high on adrenaline, or I actually found him funny.

“You should have joined the theatre club.”

He lifted his head. “The theatre club didn’t drag me from my bed in the middle of the night and force feed me prunes—so yeah. I should’ve.”

“Get up.” I dragged him to his feet, and it hit me that I was actually acting like a kidnapper, tightening my grip on his arm. “You’re not funny,” I spat in his face. “I asked a simple question. And you’re going to answer it.” I heaved out a breath. “Please. Just tell me what happened.”

We started to walk. Or I did, dragging my disgruntled classmate along with me. Kenji started to talk once we were in silence, the sound of our footsteps crunching through the ground eerily relaxing. “It was last night,” He started in a mumble. “You all dragged me out of bed.”

I nodded. “Go on.”

He sighed, squirming away from me. Kenji was trying to put as much space between us as possible. “Lesson your grip, I’m not an animal.”

I did, loosening my fingers slightly. Ahead of us, I could see my parents’ summer cabin coming into view.

“There were four of you,” Kenji said. “Two guys pulled me out of bed. A girl slammed something over my head, and when I woke up in the trunk of your car…” He turned to me, his expression contorting. I saw fear in his eyes. Fear he was trying to hide with sarcasm. “And there was you.” He turned away with a hiss. “You were the only one wearing a mask, and the others called you Brontë. You had this look in your eye. Like you were going to fucking kill me. Rip me apart and not even care.” Kenji choked out a laugh. “You were like a monster."

Something cold slithered down my spine.

“That wasn’t me.” I found myself saying, and he whipped his head around with a scoff.

“What, so is this a Split situation? College edition?” His lips curved into a scowl. “What did you do with Rowan, Imogen, and Tao? Did you kill them?"

Pulling Kenji up the wooden front steps to the cabin, I swallowed barf making its way up my throat. The closer I was getting to the cabin, I was feeling sicker. Like something was inside that I wasn’t allowed to see. That I had to ignore. “I told you already,” I told him. “I.. I have no idea.”

“But you did do something.” He whispered.

I didn’t have the heart to tell him yes.

He didn’t answer. When I stepped inside what had always been my childhood solitude, I only felt a sickening sense of foreboding. The place was exactly how I remembered it.  The rainbow welcome mat my grandpa always complimented when he stepped inside. 

Old paintwork which felt both old and nostalgic. Peeling wallpaper and the wooden staircase I’d fallen down at the age of five. As I took slow steps inside, childhood memories threatened to resurface. Mom and her pumpkin pie. Halloween with my friends, slumber parties and senior parties, and secret bonfires.

My first kiss. I pushed it all down, focusing on the missing writers. They were here. They had to be. But there was nothing abnormal with my parents’ cabin. The lounge was still as cosy as ever, threaded couches and a flat screen TV sitting on a crumbling table. The kitchen was still well-stocked. I filled a glass of water for Kenji, but he just turned his nose up at it. 

It’s weird. It’s like he knew where to go. While I was pottering around in the kitchen, trying to find anything which would signal someone had been there—my classmate strode over to a battered wooden door next to the crumbling staircase. He gestured to it with his head. “I’m going to guess it’s in the basement.”

He was right. And to be honest with you, I was fucking terrified of opening that door. I didn’t want to know what was down those stairs.  

“Hey.” Kenji coughed again, blood splattering his lips. “Are you going to check down here or not?”

Nodding, I followed him, getting a good grip on his arm. When he sent me a sour look, I swallowed a yell. “Do you want to fall down a dozen cement steps?”

It was a rhetorical question, but Kenji was Kenji.

He answered with a splutter. “Are you asking if I’d rather tumble to my death down concrete steps than end up with the same fate as the others?” Kenji stumbled when I pulled open the door. I yanked him back before he could eat his words. He didn’t finish the rest of whatever snappy comeback he’d been thinking of. 

As the two of us descended concrete steps, something hit me. I think Kenji noticed it too, stiffening up next to me. That smell. The stink which had covered him, Chemicals. Embalming fluid. The smell only grew stronger as we made our way down the stairs. When lights flickered on one by one above us, my classmate let out a strangled breath. “I knew it. You’re in a cult.”

“What?"

When his stumbling feet almost went over the edge, I pulled him back. “What are you talking about?”

“We’re walking down a secret passageway in your parents’ cabin in the woods,” he hissed out. “You’re definitely in a cult.”

He was close.

Not quite a cult, but almost. As we got closer, orangeade light began to bleed into the dark. 

Candlelight.

A sound suddenly trickled into my ears, and it took me a moment to realise what it was.

Kenji was already speaking in a sharp hiss. He jolted next to me, almost slipping.  “Fuck.” He whispered. “Is that… is that typing?

Instead of answering, I quickened my pace, dragging him along with me. Inside my parents’ basement was different. it had been… renovated. There was no sign of the shelves full of wine or my brother’s swimming pool.

Instead, I found myself staring at a several plastic chairs placed in an odd formation. There were candles set up on the floor. They were fresh flames. Just lit. Standing at the bottom of the stairs, with Kenji next to me, I wondered if I was hallucinating. Maybe that chemical smell had gone to my head. But no. Each chair was occupied. The guy was right. 

It was typing. The sound which had been pricking into my skull was the sound of synchronous typing. And then I was putting two and two together. I was seeing slumped figures in odd angles. I was seeing blurs of blonde hair and dark hair, reddish curls poking from a ratty baseball cap. And… movement. I was seeing movement. Typing. Click, click, clicking. 

I don’t know when it was when I remembered how to move. But Kenji was first. He was lunging forwards with me, stumbling over to each chair. Imogen. Tao. Rowan. Neither of them were tied up, and that was where things grew confusing. They were just sitting there. The boy’s were slumped, while Imogen sat bolt upright. Typing. They were just typing. 

When I knelt in front of Rowan and slapped his cheek, screamed at him to wake up, he didn’t move. His eyes were glued to the MacBook Pro sitting in his lap. They held no light. Like they never had light. Turning my attention to the laptop screen, there was a word document open. But what he was typing was… gibberish. 

No. No, it was a different language. Symbols which hurt my head. Rowan was typing at a speed I didn't think was possible, his fingers crooked and bent. 

“Rowan.” I was shaking. When I poked his skin, it was slimy. It stunk of that same stink. That chemical. I noticed his face was… different. His cheeks were pinker, lips plumper. Eyes wide. He was wearing makeup, I thought, a slither of panic sliding down my spine. Like he was being preserved. Again, I felt his cheeks. I pressed my hand against his forehead. He was ice cold. Ice fucking cold. Resisting the urge to jump back, I tried to ignore Kenji who was hyperventilating. 

His breaths were sharp, heavy gasps for breath as he struggled with Tao and Imogen. I grasped Rowan’s shirt, fisting the material—and there it was again, at the corner of my eye. That same wet tendril of black trying to coil around my ankle. I ignored it, pressing my hand against my classmate’s chest. 

No heartbeat. There was nothing. No beat of life, no sign of bodily fluid or struggle. 

There was one thing. I had already noticed it, but my brain didn’t want to register it. Because part of me knew what I had done to my classmate. Part of me knew exactly what I had done. I think Kenji realised, several feet away from me. He cried out, shuffling back. Rowan’s nostril was… crooked. Wider. Like it had been previously forced open. My gaze flicked to empty, unseeing eyes and smiling lips.

I couldn't look at him anymore. 

Just being near him was making me sick. 

“Tao! Hey, can you hear me?" Crouching in front of my other classmate, his skin was ice cold. This time, a pinkish froth was dripping from his nose. Which confirmed my suspicions. I heaved, then. But nothing was coming up. “Get away from them,” I managed to gasp out to Kenji, who was prodding Imogen in the head. He was… crying. I had been so focused on what I was seeing, I didn’t notice tears splashing down his cheeks, mixing with tinged red. 

“What… is this?” He whispered. “What did you do?” His voice cracked. “Is this… is this what you were going to do to me?”

He gestured to Rowan. “What the fuck did you do? Why are they… why are they typing?”

It was a writing factory, I thought dizzily. Whoever I had been working with, we had created a writing factory under my parents’ cabin.

What were they, some kind of farm? Why create a human farm created to write?

And why were they writing?

“This is what you did to them?” Kenji hissed out. He stumbled back, eyes wide. “Are you going to do this to me?”

"No!" 

"But you took me! You were going to do this to me!?" 

He backed away, and I found myself grabbing him. I was desperate. I needed him to know I didn’t do this. I didn’t do this!

Hours of confusion and frustration finally reached a boiling point.  “Why are you looking at me?!” I yelled, fear and frustration taking over. “Do you really think I have the time and effort to do all of… this?! You think I’m the grand mastermind to whatever this sick shit is?”

Kenji spat at me. “They’re dead.” He said. “They’re fucking dead! They’re dead, and they’re writing a novel? How is that possible?!”

My attention flicked to another room in the corner. The door was slightly open. And I saw it. I saw spattered dark shrouding the doorway, like this thing, this thing inside my head, was protecting it. Slowly, I started towards it, but Kenji’s voice sliced into my thoughts. He was frowning at something on the wall. It looked like notes. I didn’t recognise the handwriting. 

“Caulfield.” The boy said in a low murmur. 

Cocking his head, Kenji managed to get a hold of himself, focusing on the notes. I followed him, skim-reading through writing. It didn’t seem that important. It was just story ideas. He turned to me, his eyes slightly unfocused. “That was the name of the guy who dragged me out of bed.”

“Did you see his face?” I asked.

“No, it was too dark. They hit me so I could barely concentrate on anything,” Kenji’s eyes lit up. “But you’re Bronte. And he’s Caulfield. Like Emily Brontë and Holden Caulfield. I think another of them was Finch. I’m going to say you and the girl are the Brontë sisters.”

Atticus Finch. Holden Caulfield. 

The Brontë sisters. 

“Famous writers.” I murmured. "So, code names?"

Kenji nodded. “Obviously.” He muttered. “But there’s more. You were talking crazy shit. Some kind of halving, and… and Thoth. You said something about Thoth."

“Thoth?”

“Thoth. God of literature.” Kenji paled. “But that can’t be… what this is, right?”

Before I could register what he was saying, I noticed something move at the corner of my eye.

I could have sworn… just for a second. Had Tao straightened up? 

A trick of my mind, I thought dizzily.

Kenji was smart. He knew what the fuck he was talking about. So, I was going to listen. 

Suddenly, he was the one leading. While I was stumbling along behind him. But he only got several steps before he was doubling over, a wet sounding cough sending him to his knees.

More red trickled down his chin. When I gently grabbed him and pulled him to his feet, his eyes were wide like an animal. “You need to get this shit off me,” He hissed out. “Get it off me! Now!” He coughed again, and this time his whole chest moved. Like something was being dislodged inside him. Before I could help him, he was diving to his feet and staggering to the door I swore I wouldn’t open. But he didn’t go fully in, instead stopping abruptly in the doorway. Kenji coughed again. This time through a sob.

“What the fuck.” Kenji said. “Is that?”

Spread across the carpet, was what was left of a deer carcass, it’s heart ripped out— and smeared all over the walls, were symbols. A  surgical bed was set up, blood staining steel. Velcro straps. I had another flash of shoving a body down and pinning squirming wrists down. 

Eleanor.


The memory was short, but it showed me everything I needed to know.

I heard her rattling cough in perfect clarity in my head, and something splattered in my face. And I was reaching forward, pulling at something scarlet and slithering through her bulging lips. My gaze went to a metal bowl, and my gut twisted into knots. He runs back to the writers, and I stumbles. My gaze goes to what looks like instructions. “Oh, god.” He dropped to his knees and heaved, choking on bloody saliva.

“I think I know what they’re doing.” He said in frenzied cries, trying and failing to scrub at himself. “I know what they’re doing. Oh fuck. Jesus. I know what they’re doing!”

I knew what he meant.

Because then I was seeing it.

Hearing Kenji’s spluttered coughs, I could suddenly hear Rowan’s. Tao’s. Imogen coughing up liquidised red lumps streaming from her nose and mouth. The embalmment made sense. The dead bodies were just empty of thought, but everything else. Even the prunes in Kenji’s mouth. What I thought was some prank. 

I was seeing preservation.

Mummification.

Or at least the start of it.

The only thing which didn’t make sense was the symbols on the walls. Whatever they were writing.

Kenji was laughing, sobbing, a hysterical mess.

“This? This shit all over me? It’s inducing it!”

He heaved again, and part of me splintered. Whatever he had been embalmed in… I had to get it off.

The sound of engines, however, stopped us both dead. I didn’t have time to think. Dragging my classmate back up the stairs, I grabbed his face and forced him to look at me. “There’s a river two minutes from here,” I gasped out. “That should help you a little. Then get the cops.”

I couldn’t take my eyes off of sharp red rivulets snaking from his nostril. He nodded. “Untie me.” Kenji slurred in a panic. His chest was rattling. “Now!”

Grabbing a knife, I remember the blade cut through his first zip tie. Then though, I was seeing it again. This time it pooled from the floor and rained down from the ceiling. My vision turned foggy, and I felt myself drop to my knees, and then face-plant the ground spilling inky black. "Cassie?" 

Kenji's voice collapsed into a whistling sound. 

"Hey, what are you doing?" 

"Cassie!" 

I don’t know how long I was out for. I dreamed of a room with sharp edges. Shadows in front of me.

My own voice speaking in tongues.

I woke up at home. I was lying on my bedroom floor, and when I sat up, my head spinning, my hands were slick red. The most beautiful, terrifying, mesmerising shade I’d ever seen. It streaked my palms and drenched the tips of my fingers, staining my wrists and arms.

Kenji.

His name was the first in my mouth—because it was his. It must have been his, I had been with him.

I was going to let him go.

Let him run.

What happened after I blacked out? The last thing which was concrete in my memory was the blade of my knife cutting through his restraints.

I showered four times that morning. But it wouldn’t come off. Like Kenji’s blood was as stubborn as Kenji himself. I don’t know what my shadow did. I don’t know how she had driven my body back to my house and left me to pick up the pieces of what I was sure was my classmate. I didn’t wait for the announcement of Kenji’s disappearance. I knew I was involved, and that was all I needed to know. My dizzy and foggy thoughts led me to the sheriff’s station. And I was admitting to the crime my other half, my splintered shadow, had committed.

I said their names, and they sounded so strange coming from my lips when I knew their fate. When I knew where they were.

“Rowan Carlisle, Imogen Rode, Tao Aster, Eleanor Martinez…” I stuffed my hands in my pockets. “And Kenji Cato.”

There was a pause, and I thought the receptionist was going to speak before her gaze wandered behind me.

Her eyes widened. “May I help you?”

“Cassie Hughes, what are you doing here?”

A gruff voice sent me twisting around, and I found myself face to face with my creative writing teacher. His smile was friendly.

Professor Peterson.

In my head, another memory was brewing.

A fourth figure looming over three small shadows.

Prof Peterson cleared his throat. “I apologise for this,” He said cheerily. “My student is under a lot of stress right now. I can assure you she has nothing to do with the disappearances,” His arm slung around my shoulder, and in turn a soaking darkness wound around my throat. I felt it choking me, and once again I was all too aware I wasn’t just painted in what was left of Kenji. But Rowan, Imogen and Tao. Eleanor.

“Come on now, Miss Hughes.” Professor  Peterson said, as cutting tendrils found my neck, choking words from my throat.

“Let’s not be dramatic.”
