I don’t know where I am.

One minute, I’m sitting at my desk doing a bit of research on how taxes work and the next I’m in a library. It was so sudden that I didn’t even notice it happen, I look down at my screen and suddenly realize I’m nose deep in a book, look up and I’m suddenly not in my home but a giant library. The book didn’t even have anything to do with taxes, at least I don’t think it does. I can’t read it but it looks like its in Spanish?

I don’t know where to even begin, there wasn’t even any of those classical warnings through out the day or weird webpages. My day was a normal office job, doing mundane shit for a company I don’t care for. I get home, eat dinner, and then start looking up how my taxes work. I didn’t go to any weird pages or anything, I went to my government tax website. I haven’t done anything to warrant getting magicked into this goddamn library.

…

I guess I should describe it, maybe someone knows where I am or what happened to me.

Well to start with, there’s two floors and everything is a giant hallway, all of the walls covered in books. The second floor is accessed by some wooden ladders that are strewn about and the second floor is more like, a really tall walkway kind of like those prisons or malls you see in movies. Also the hallway thing, this place just goes on and one forever, except it occasionally turns into a Y or X crossing going off into more forever. I’m also pretty sure it doesn’t obey the laws of physics because I think I took 4 left turns in short order and did not end up where I started. It’s also all in the old wood with red carpet and gold trimming style with what looks like an eye stenciled onto the occasional pillar.

I am also completely alone. I’ve been walking for hours now and was actively making as much noise as possible for the first one and nothing has answered me back.

The only thing I have to keep me company are the books, when I can find one in English at least. Most of them are in languages I can’t read, but I think they’re all real languages so there’s that. There also isn’t any sort of rhyme or reason to how the books are placed. I found a book on taxonomy between a French copy of Harry Potter and an Italian porno.

UPDATE:

I’ve been here for about a day, according to my phone. The thing is, I haven’t felt it. I don’t feel tired or hungry or thirsty and my battery hasn’t budges from 47%. I don’t think I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m going to be stuck here for a long time, otherwise I’d probably be panicking.

I also haven’t found any books which can help me. The closest I got might have been some book on theoretical physics and teleportation.

If anyone has any ideas on how to get me out of here, or even where I am then please help me.
