As she wept into my shoulder, I heard the siren start up again. It sounded muffled inside the church, but still vibrated the floors and the walls all around us. I didn’t know what the siren signified, but I doubted it was anything good. After all, the last time the siren had sounded, we had run into something horrible: dozens of walking corpses with white eyes that seemed to look at us with thirst and hunger.

But I had no plans, not anymore. We were unarmed and seemed to be in a relatively safe place. My main thought was that we should hide in here until morning, when daylight arrived and made travel safer. We could always try jumping the police car, or even finding a car where the tires weren’t totally flat and jumping that to drive it out of the town. I had seen dozens of car keys in the diner, and one of them had to fit with one of the more reliable cars parked on the street. If I had to, I’d drive my car on the rims as far as it would go and then abandon it once we were outside the town limits. Anything would be better than being trapped here another night.

The siren wound down again, its haunting echoes dissipating in the night. I turned to Betty, flipping my phone over to get some light.

“Let’s search this place,” I said. “Maybe we can find a weapon. This is the priest’s living quarters, I think, so that means there should at least be knives for cooking somewhere around here. If we’re lucky, maybe the guy even had a gun.” This was a thought I had considered already, going from house to house to search for guns. This was, after all, rural New Hampshire, deep in the mountains, where people liked to hunt, and where farmers would likely keep some sort of shotgun or rifle for pests. If we were armed, our chances of survival would rise exponentially- at least, so I hoped. For all I knew, ammo would be as useless as a squirt gun against those things we had seen coming out of the forest.

My wife wiped away her tears, then she reached into her purse and pulled out her keychain. She dropped it into my hand. I looked at it for a moment, confused.

“That black thing,” she said, pointing at a small canister connected to the chain, “is pepper spray. I don’t know how effective it is, and I’ve had it for nearly ten years. It might not even work at this point. I don’t think pepper spray really goes bad, though. It should still be able to stop someone in their tracks.”

“Yeah, someone, as in, a human,” I said. “We don’t even know if those things feel pain. Their eyes…” I didn’t need to finish the sentence. She had seen their strange, cataract eyes. She knew as well as I did that we weren’t dealing with the living.

I got up, sighing. I took her hand and helped her up. We grabbed our phones, and she grabbed her purse and plastic bag of goodies, lighting a cigarette with trembling fingers. It took her nearly three tries to get it lit. She reminded me of a Parkinson’s patient in his last days.

We explored the rectory area in silence, finding a small kitchen. As I suspected, it had a knife block with some long, wicked blades. I took one for myself and gave one to Betty. We went back to the rectory and searched every drawer and closet, but I could find no sign of a gun or ammo.

Feeling slightly better now that I at least had a knife, we went back to the chapel. I shone my phone’s light across the immense chamber, and my heart leapt into my throat.

The front doors stood wide open now, letting the dim moonlight stream into the nave. Even worse, the corpses were all gone.

And, while we were in the rectory, someone had used blood to write a message across the wall, covering the stained-glass windows and aged beams in letters five feet tall: “THE BLACK SUN AWAKENS.”

As I stood there, gaping, not sure what to do, Betty grabbed my arm and pointed outside the door.

“Look!” she cried, a note of triumph in her voice. “Someone’s coming!” I saw with excitement that she was right. I felt a surge of hope rise in me so powerful that I felt light-headed. Headlights streamed down the dark street, casting long, twisting shadows across the buildings. I grabbed her hand and we ran outside without a second thought.

The car traveled slowly down Main Street, coming from the same direction we had originally come. We ran out into the middle of the road, and I started waving my arms frantically, trying to get the driver’s attention. A chubby old man pulled up beside us, looking at us with suspicion and narrowing his eyes. I gestured for him to put his window down. He hesitated for a long moment, looking between me and my wife, and then lowered it an eighth of an inch. I heard all his doors lock as he quickly pressed the button.

“Um, does anyone live here?” he asked. “I need gas. The map said there’s a gas station here, supposed to be 24 hours, but there’s no one inside. It doesn’t look like anyone’s been inside in weeks. All the food in the refrigerators has started to rot, and there’s not even electricity. So…” He trailed off. I didn’t even know where to start. I certainly didn’t want to start rambling about walking corpses and messages painted in blood. But Betty, always my smarter and better half, thought quickly instead.

“We had a massive electrical failure,” she said, lying smoothly and smiling at him with her disarming charm. I saw the old man relax slightly, though he still glanced over at me with suspicion from time to time. “We really need help. Our car broke down and everyone besides us was already evacuated.”

“Yeah…” the old man said skeptically. “Makes sense, I guess. OK. So you both live here?” I nodded, building on the lie.

“Yes, we used to, but we missed the evacuation. Can you please give us a ride just to the highway?” I said, giving him what I hoped was a neighborly smile. He frowned, the lines on his face deepening.

“What’s your name, friend?” he asked, not answering my question and refusing to roll down his window anymore than the tiny crack he had made.

“I’m Jonny Redfern, and this is my wife Betty. Please, sir, we really need your help.”

“How come you two didn’t just walk out of here?” he asked. “The highway is only a ten-minute drive. It’s not exactly around the corner, but it shouldn’t take you more than a couple hours to walk it.” I swore inwardly. Of course we had to get an old man who was as sharp as a tack. If he kept talking to us, he would inevitably pick up on our lies. In fact, he probably already had. The story wouldn’t make much sense, especially when he kept driving and saw the messages painted in blood on the police station. 

“And, um… well, I’m not saying you’re being dishonest or anything, God forbid, but if people were evacuated, why are all their cars still here? Did they walk out? Did they all take a bus? It sure looks like they’ve been here a while.” I froze, not knowing what to say in response. I looked over at Betty, her pretty dark eyes narrowing with consternation as she stared at the old man.

“Sir, what’s your name?” she asked him pleasantly, changing her face in a moment back to the beatific and friendly smile she always used in her job as a real estate agent for difficult customers.

“I’m Freddy. Freddy MacKenzie,” he said. He looked like he considered rolling the window down to shake our hands, but instead, he quickly looked away.

“OK, please listen to me, Freddy. Something strange is going on here. We don’t know what it is. We really need your help. I’m afraid if we stay in this town any longer, something… something really bad is going to happen to us,” Betty said, her smile fading. Freddy’s bright blue eyes shone with intelligence as he weighed her words, looking from my face to hers before frowning slightly and wrinkling his forehead.

“Yeah, no, I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sure you two are very nice people, but I don’t pick up hitchhikers, ever. I don’t know you guys from Adam. But, if you want, I can call you a tow truck when I get on the highway. Or even a police officer. They can sort this mess out. I really don’t know what’s going on here, and I don’t want to know. This is none of my business. But I wish you both good luck.” He put his car back in drive and rolled his window back up. Waving in a friendly manner but not meeting our eyes, he pulled away at a snail’s pace, going at least ten miles under the speed limit as he languidedly drove down the road.

“I should’ve maced him,” Betty said bitterly, watching the old man’s tail lights as they grew smaller. “I really should’ve. I thought about it, you know.”

“What would that have accomplished?” I asked.

“Well, it would have made me feel better,” she said. We both laughed, an anxious and nervous release of tension that I felt I needed at that moment.

 A gunshot pierced the night. I jumped, almost falling on the sidewalk curb as I quickly backed off of the road. I grabbed Betty to steady myself. She was looking down the road, at the old man’s red brake lights. They cast a bloody glow across the Main Street. Another gunshot rang out, and I could hear a loud hiss, as if a monstrous snake had just awakened.

But it wasn’t a snake. We watched Freddy’s car as clouds of smoke and plumes of exhaust began rising from the engine, and the hissing grew louder. I realized something must have given in his engine when the bullet passed through. His tires looked fine, but even from this distance, I could see a puddle expanding around his car. I didn’t know anything about cars, but from my meager knowledge, I assumed it was likely coolant or transmission fluid. Either one was not good.

“What should we do?” Betty asked, grabbing my hand tightly.

“I’m not running in the direction of gunshots, if that’s what you’re asking,” I said quickly. “We should take cover. Let’s go back to the church for now.”

“What about the old man?” she asked, more loudly now. “What’s going to happen to him?”

“We should worry about ourselves!” I yelled at her, not meaning to raise my voice. She shrank back as if I had slapped her. I stepped forward, taking her hand and whispering. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to get angry.”

“What if he dies because we did nothing?” she asked.

“He did nothing to help us!” I said.

“Well, he was going to call for help, at least. I can’t really blame him for not picking up two wild-eyed strangers with a bullshit story in the middle of an abandoned town.” I kept watching his car, but he didn’t get out. “Do you think he was hit?” she asked.

“God, I don’t know,” I said, feeling like things were quickly spiraling out of control. Our potential rescue had turned into a potential burden. Luck was not on our side today.

The old man’s tail lights changed as he put his car in reverse. He tried to slowly back up in our direction, but the engine made loud knocking sounds when he pressed the gas, and the thick cloud of smoke began to expand, rising up in the air in huge, billowing plumes. I heard metallic groaning sounds as the knocking died down. And then his car stopped moving, and the engine shut off by itself. 

He hadn’t managed to reverse more than twenty feet in that time. I wondered what he was thinking at that moment- whether he thought we were part of some band of robbers who had staged a gunman up ahead. If I were in his shoes, I felt certain that would be my first assumption. After all, who else in the town was there to blame? A secret gunman and vandal who hid in buildings or in forests, yes, and corpses who got up and moved around. But no one in their right mind would buy that story- at least until they had seen it for themselves.

“OK, fuck it, let’s go get the old man out of his car and make sure he’s…” I started to say, but then the siren came on again, seemingly even louder and shriller than before. I covered my ears with my hands, and without thinking, I ran forwards towards the old man’s car, hoping I would live to regret the decision.

***

By the time I had run through Main Street, the siren had started to die out again. It seemed to be getting shorter every time it ran. I didn’t know what to think about that. I tried to justify it by saying perhaps the building where the siren was located ran on generators, and they were running out of fuel, so to compensate, they ran the siren less and less each time. But why run it at all? There was no tornado here, no hurricane or tsunami. I felt like I was missing an essential piece of the puzzle. As I got to within ten feet of his car, I saw the old man moving inside, apparently unharmed.

Freddy stumbled out of the driver’s seat, shaking and pale. He looked at me with wide, accusing eyes.

“What did you do?!” he asked me. “I’m warning you, I have a gun!” I looked around, at his hands and next to his seat. I saw no gun, and I assumed he might be bluffing. However, I wasn’t going to risk my life on it. I still had the butcher’s knife tucked into the back of my pants, the blade looped through my leather belt, and had even pulled my shirt over it so the old man wouldn’t see it and get scared.

I put my hands up and backed slowly away. His eyes narrowed even more, as if he suspected a trick.

“Please, I’m just trying to help,” I said. “My wife and I, we’re not actually from here. We’re from Connecticut. We came here, just like you, just to stop for a minute. But someone slashed our tires, and this town has some… strange things happening in it. I can’t explain it. That siren, every time it goes off…” I didn’t know what to say next. “I think it’s a warning, or perhaps a signal. Every time it goes off, we see people walking around. Maybe they’re part of a cult, or a terrorist group. But we need to get to safety now. There’s a church just down the street with deadbolts on all the doors. It can be locked from the inside and maybe even barricaded. We should go there immediately. If you won’t come with us, that’s your decision, but I’ll tell you right now, you probably won’t survive out here.”

“Is that a threat?!” he asked, his blue eyes blazing with anger. His chubby face reddened, and even his bald head had a crimson hue.

“OK, fine, I tried,” I said, giving up and turning to leave. “Stay here and die.” I started walking away, not looking back. I heard heavy footsteps slapping against the pavement, and suddenly, he was at my side, walking with me. He sighed heavily, the redness slowly fading out of his face.

“I’ll come with you,” he said. “But if this is a trick, know that I intend to report all of this to the police as soon as possible.”

“My friend,” I said, quickening my step and starting to jog towards the church, “if the police were coming, don’t you think they’d already be here?”

***

After we got into the church and locked all the doors, we saw dark silhouettes walking past the stained-glass windows. They surrounded the church, their strange gait revealing their inhuman nature even based on their shadows. I knew it was the corpses, like the ones I had seen come out of the woods. Off in the distance, one of them started to scream, a shrill, piercing noise that carried on the wind. It sounded like she was here, standing right next to me in the church. I shuddered.

I heard a few of the corpses respond, until it sounded like the shrieking came from all around the perimeter of the building. Yet they didn’t try to get in. If they had smashed through the stained-glass windows, they could have easily crawled through, yet they didn’t. At least, not yet.

Soon, I heard a sound like a man crying in pain. This scream sounded far different than the empty banshee wails of the corpses. I looked through a pane of clear glass and saw the woman from the forest, the walking nightmare with the black, matted hair and white cataract eyes. 

Next to her I saw two children, twins from the look of them, dressed in nearly identical clothing. Two little boys, holding hands and walking behind her. The skin on their faces had mostly peeled off, showing the eternally grinning skulls underneath. Their eyes had turned white, with drops of thick, black blood dripping down their face like tears. Their bodies looked partially decomposed, just like the woman, with sharp finger bones poking out through the skin. On their hands, I could see the tendons and ligaments and muscle underneath in places where the skin had been eaten away.

In front of them, I saw a man crawling on his hands and knees out of the dark forest on the perimeter of the town. His leg looked broken, the area around his knee twisted at a 45 degree angle, matted blood soaking into the denim. By the time I realized what I was looking at, all three had caught up to him. The woman’s corpse gnashed her teeth as she drew near, biting at the air and smiling. The twins looked serene, as if they were just going on a walk to the playground. They didn’t hurry or run, knowing their prey was injured and doomed.

The man looked back at them, an expression of sheer terror twisting his face. And then all three were on him, eating him alive from the legs and stomach. His agony-filled shrieks shattered the night. I turned away. Within a couple minutes, everything had gone quiet again. But I saw dozens more of those silhouettes passing on Main Street, or coming from the graveyard behind the church. I wondered just how many of them we were up against.

Over time, Freddy warmed up to us. He seemed to realize we weren’t lunatics who were going to stab him and eat his heart while praying to a serpent-god in Aramaic. He ended up being much more talkative than I would have expected. When we talked to him in the car, he came across as an aloof curmudgeon who wouldn’t have helped his own mother if she fell down.

“You know what this reminds me of,” he said, his eyes widening, as if he were telling a ghost story around a campfire. “Roanoke. Those people disappeared without a trace.”

“I’m pretty sure they just interbred with the Natives,” Betty said. “The Mary Celeste was similar to this, though. The crew just disappeared from the ship in the middle of the ocean. No one knows where they went.” The two of them acted much more relaxed than I felt. My nerves felt jangled, and I just kept waiting for the next siren. Or, maybe, the gunman who shot out Freddy’s engine block would show up, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and carrying buckets of blood around with him to paint messages whenever he felt like it. I could see him in my mind’s eye- a nutjob in a ski mask, two dark eyes glaring out at me, his heart filled with bloodlust and murder.

“These people didn’t really disappear, though, did they?” I said, turning to look at them. “We found the corpses of a couple dozen of them here, in the church. And we have seen more of them outside.”

“But where’s the rest of them?” Betty asked. Freddy looked at her, raising an eyebrow. “There’s way more than a few dozen people living in this town. Where’s all the bodies? Maybe the rest of the town isn’t even dead.”

“You didn’t tell me that someone staged bodies in this church,” Freddy said accusingly, looking at Betty. She shrugged.

“So?”

“So maybe,” he lowered his voice, “this place is haunted. Did you ever think of that?” Betty laughed at that, and even I cracked a smile.

“My friend,” I said, “this whole town is apparently haunted. I wouldn’t worry about the church.”

***

I don’t know how much time passed, but after they talked for a few more minutes, we ended up just sitting there in silence. Betty and I smoked cigarettes, and Freddy drank some of the whiskey she had grabbed.

“Just to steel my nerves,” he said, and he looked like he needed it. He was still shaking, and he would often get up and pace in a circle, muttering to himself and sending dirty looks towards the blood-stained pews. Ever since we told him about the bodies, he had seemed much more uncomfortable and frightened. I knew how he felt. I felt the same restlessness and terror within me. It seemed like we were trying to hide in the closet as the house burned down around us. But what else could we do?

Soon, that decision would be taken out of our hands.

I realized the church seemed to be getting brighter. Freddy and Betty didn’t notice for a few moments, as they had started up another conversation, this time about the sigil painted on the mutilated body of Jesus hanging upside down from the ceiling. But I noticed the lightening immediately. For a second, I thought maybe the electricity had come back on but that the lights were just dim, or that maybe someone was driving outside and their high beams shone through the windows.

But I quickly realized that this light had a different texture. It was almost like a black light, giving off an intense, purplish glow over everything it touched. Betty had gone silent, her mouth open in silent awe. Freddy rubbed his hand over his bald head, opening his mouth.

“...uhhh, what?” he said. He stopped his pacing, nervously smoothing out his shirt. “What is this? Is this some sort of stage trick?”

“Not from me,” I said, looking around the church. All the dark corners were now illuminated, shining with the eerie light. I could see the bloodstains glowing on the pews, looking almost black against the shining mahogany hue of the wood. The sigil of Lucifer shone with an intensity that dwarfed everything else in the church, however. It was so bright that I had to turn away.

The light it gave off was a dark red, and when I closed my eyes, I could still see that crimson symbol burned into my sight. As I looked out the side window, I saw that the light seemed to be coming from the forest at the edge of town, deep behind thick groves of evergreens and muddy swamps. It felt almost like looking into a second sun, and I quickly moved away from the window, my vision still swarming with bright dots and white light.

The strange slogan I had seen painted on the police station came into my mind: “We follow the Black Sun.” Was this what they meant?

“I want to go investigate,” I said. They looked at me as if I was crazy. “We can’t just stay here forever. Maybe we’re supposed to figure this place out, or stop what’s happening.”

“And who, may I ask, gave you this divine order? God?” Freddy asked, smiling. “No one is ‘supposed’ to do anything except survive. If you want to die…” He never got to finish, as the siren sound had started up again. I realized, as I listened intently to the shrill, deafening wail, that it appeared to be coming from the same place as this eerie light that flooded the town. It shook the floors and walls, and caused the upside-down statue of Jesus to start moving from side to side, swaying like a pendulum.

As soon as it had stopped, I heard crashing at the back door. It sounded as if dozens of people threw their bodies against the locked doors that led out the rear entrance, towards the graveyard. Yet no one tried to break down the front doors. Without thinking, I undid the front door’s deadbolt and ran outside, not looking back to see if they would follow me.

With the light flooding in, I could see much more of the town illuminated. Looking into the cop car, I realized it was not empty at all. The body of a police officer sat in the driver’s seat, lying sideways so his head rested on the center console. He had a single gunshot through his temple, and I saw the gun, still in his hand.

I opened the driver’ s side door, and a horrible odor of rotten eggs, rancid meat and feces hit me immediately. I held my breath, trying not to gag. I took the gun from his hand, and quickly undid his belt, pulling it off. I turned and saw Freddy and Betty behind me, pale and watchful, looking terrified as they continuously glanced back at the church.

“Hide,” I said quickly. I got on my belly and slid under the cop car, not looking back to see if they would follow my orders. If they didn’t, they would probably die.

As soon as I was underneath it, a gun in one hand and a heavy police belt with mace, a taser and extra ammo in the other, I saw bodies stream out the front door of the church. Many were no more than skeletons with some tendons and gore still clinging to the bones, yet they still were able to walk. They moved quickly, looking around with empty eye sockets and rotting faces.

Betty had, by this point, crawled underneath beside me. I turned and saw her, watching the corpses with wide, girlish eyes. I didn’t see where Freddy had gone.

The corpses emerging from the church split off in groups, going in different directions. After a few minutes, none remained on the street, at least from what I could see. Looking back and forth quickly, the pistol extended in my right hand, I slid out from under the police car. I took the weapons and ammo off the belt, giving Betty a taser and another canister of mace.

“Give the extra mace to Freddy,” I whispered. “Where is Freddy?” A half-smile crossed her face, and she pointed to the dumpster in an alley behind us. Quietly, I walked over and opened the lid, peering inside. I saw Freddy, maggots writhing in his hair, a banana peel stuck to his chest. The smell from inside the dumpster was bad, though not nearly as bad as the rotting corpse smell from the police car.

Freddy climbed out, grumbling and wiping himself off. Betty gave him the cop’s mace canister, and I started walking towards the source of the eerie, black light, hoping to find answers.

Though this happened three months ago, I still question my decision that day. For that was the moment when I sealed our fates. The moment I set my mind towards walking towards the Black Sun, I ensured we would see Hell itself.
