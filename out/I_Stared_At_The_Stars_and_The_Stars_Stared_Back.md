I had always been fascinated by the night sky, ever since I was a child. The brain of a child barely able to walk upright and articulate thoughts beyond incoherent babble found itself easily entranced by the inexplicable glimmering lights glowing in the blackness above us. Growing up in the city, the stars would scarcely make themselves known to me as the overabundance of light drew them away, but during the drives away from the hustle-and-bustle, they would come back out and dot the skies with their shimmering splendor. It was during these drives where I found myself, strapped to a baby chair in the backseat of my parent’s car, staring up through the sunroof as the lights peppered the sky as we drew further from the city as my dad would play his assortment of classics over the speakers - a likely reason as to why when even later on in adulthood the sight of stars would cause Pink Floyd and Sade to play in my subconscious.

These simple, serene memories nestled themselves deep in my head; a cozy warmth for me to return to while fronting the chaos of it all. I would grow older, ultimately, this innate fascination blossoming into a profund curiosity. Why did some stars grow brighter than others? Why were they spread out so haphazardly? Why did some shine a different hue? How far were they away from us truly? What orbited those stars? I could go on - the adolescent mind, wholly innocent and all too curious, had far too much idle time to flood its mind with cascading lines of thought. I would fine myself idling away, daydreaming about the night sky.and its mysteries. This curiosity would ignite a flame that would smolder deep within me in my formative years - a yearning to learn and understand what lay beyond the unreachable vastness of the night sky. To even touch the surface of its infinity. Dreams of working at NASA or any adjacently prestigious institution spurred me through my education.

But sometimes, dreams aren’t enough.

The older you grow, the more you realise dreams are often just that - dreams. As life happens, you make compromises. In those compromises, you give up a little bit of yourself with each harsh reality you are forced to confront. Whether you like it or not, those dreams, once crystal-clear, will begin to fade and waver, turning murky and hazy, eventually dissipating entirely as compromise and necessity overwrite the naive aspirations of a younger self that lay buried beneath the burden of reality. And it was so that I found myself working a job I hate to make ends meet in my early thirties. Clock-in, clock-out, repeat ad nauseum. 

Until I found myself caught myself gazing into the sky during the drive home from working overtime one Friday night. An orange star shone ever so slightly brighter than the rest, naturally catching my eye. The roads were uncrowded at this hour, and so I was able to gaze upon that singular star as I slowly drove home upon the route I could drive practically on autopilot at this point. From that cozy corner tucked away in the back of my mind, long since forgotten, Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here” echoed out as a wave of nostalgia washed over me. I felt a familiar spark flicker within, catching flame to long dormant kindling. I felt as though I had just regained a part of myself I had lost for so long. The child lost in the chaotic crowd of the real world - how confused and scared he must have been. I reached out my hand to the child, and grasped his hand, unbruised and devoid of any callouses, in my mine. In that moment, we were reunited, and I promised to not let go this time. 

For the first time in a long time, I felt whole again.

I wouldn’t let the child’s hand go again, I decided. I got home and immediately took to scouring for telescopes online. The good, professional stuff was pricey - unless you were willing to bump your standards down and get them used. Which I was. Behind every single one of those telescopes, I wondered if there was a person that had lost their inner child too. It didn’t take long for me to find it - it seemed to be antique, boasting a hefty wooden frame with thick lenses and a smaller telescope mounted atop the main scope, typical of telescopes of the time. Based on the photos provided, it seemed to be in mint condition, the wood shining with a varnished sheen, and the golden ornamentation embellished over its frame was unworn and unscratched, bar some strange engravings etched into their surface that I figured was part of the design. It was a beautiful piece of history. It was also very cheap. Too good to be true levels of cheap.

After a few day’s wait, it arrived. I set up the telescope on the small, but better than nothing, balcony that was one of the few selling points of my apartment. Its stand was just as antique and well-crafted as the main piece, and it wasn’t until I had physically interacted with the telescope that I truly came to appreciate just how well-maintaned all of it was. The crystal lenses gleamed immaculately under the light, the wood smooth and faintly smelling of resin, and the gold ornamentation, even if mock gold, was of fine quality and had a professional finish to it. The strange etchings upon it however, did not seem so professionally done. On closer inspection, they seem to had been made after the telescope’s assembly, rather than being a part of its whole design. They were done by a previous owner - still, with remarkable precision and care as every line and curve was expertly carved onto its surface. I figured it was once an art project of some sort, and had outlived its purpose to its owner. The engravings would also explain why it went for dirt cheap online.

From that day on, it became ritual for me to set up the scope right around evening as soon as the stars would stop hiding away, play a playlist of the same classics I would hear all those years ago, crack open a cold one, and just stare into the skies just like before. The inner child would come to play again, pondering, dreaming, fantasizing. The wonder of it all itching parts of my brain that had not been itched in so long. Behind every star, a story untold. A story no one would ever know - not in my lifetime, at least. Who knew if the stars in our sky were even alive anymore? For all we knew, Earth could be one of the only planets that could view these ‘ghost stars’ - stars long extinct, their afterglow burned onto our night sky, only to one day fizzle out entirely. These sessions became therapeutic for me, and I even began to journal every night’s stargazing session. Even if changes were marginal night-to-night, it didn’t matter. Even the littlest things are exciting, given you have the passion for it. Most entries were mundane and uneventful to anyone else, but that didn’t matter. It was something that was entirely mine. It felt like every facet of my life began to improve - sleep, work, socialising, everything. A pleasant normalcy had been established.

A normalcy that would not last.

Most stars have been observed and documented - every single star we could ever see, is likely known and named. Certain stars were only visible to us under certain conditions, and with how polluted with light our skies have become it isn’t uncommon for most stars to be entirely invisible to us.

These were not those stars.

The ‘phantom stars’ started appearing around a month ago. These were stars that should not - *could not* \- have existed, yet I saw them, more appearing each following night. At first, I thought them bright, distant stars whose light had only just reached Earth. Such an event would have made waves in the astronomy community, yet it never did. There was never any mention of newly discovered stars, at least none that were made public for whatever reason. And I didn’t know which one was more harrowing, the fact that these new stars were being covered up for whatever reason, or that I was the only one that could see them. That wasn’t even the strangest part about them. Their appearances was unlike any other star, and each one was unique. Some had a phantasmal glow about them that pulsated at regular intervals, like a heartbeat. Some strobed through the known spectrum of colours. Some seemed to swirl and pull in the light around them, like wormholes. And the strangest thing?

There were all invisible under the naked eye. It was only when I peered through the telescope, could I even glimpse them.

Documenting these stars had become an obsession of mine. Workdays were spent longing to get home to see what new discoveries I would make through the telescope. My journals were now dedicated entirely to the study of these phantoms in our night sky. Every night was different. There was no consistency to the position, shapes or colour of these stars. It made documenting their properties practically impossible. Through these stars’ inexplicable nature, I once again felt a familiar sensation, unbeknownst to me since my childhood. That wanderlust. That boundless curiosity. My imagination ran wild once more, unrestrained by our known reality.

Months would go by. Filled out journals piled at my desk, each one of them containing observations of hundreds upon hundreds of phantasmal stars. As time would pass, their appearance grew more and more abstract. Shapes that seemed incomprehensible and nonsensical. Non-euclidean masses of colour shifting and contorting like serpents coiling in the beyond. It was as if the universe itself was transforming before my very eyes. After witnessing such spectacle, how could I not have made it my mission to ascertain just how this telescope functioned?

The secret was in the runes.

After some time, I was convinced that behind every rune engraved upon its gold ornamentation lay some esoteric meaning, and carried some ancient purpose - but what it was, I could never decipher. I imitated some of the engravings onto the frame of my own pair of reading glasses, curious to see if that was what made the telescope special. And sure enough, it was. I gazed into the night sky with my glasses, and was able to see faint impressions and hazy images of the phantom stars. It wasn’t as potent as looking at it through the telescope itself, but it proved that there was more to these runes than I had initially thought. It was then that I began to experiment. I had carved the markings into the frame of the sliding glass door that led to my balcony, and once again, through the glass I would see the unclear and fuzzy visions of phantom stars. Their lack of clarity I had figured to be due to my sloppy imitation of the runic symbols. And so I committed myself to learning to carve them with the same intricacy as they were carved with on the telescope. Every line as straight as can be from point to point, every arc curved with subtle intent, every circle made perfect.

A few more months would pass. Even more journals littered my desk, now documenting the journey from scrawled and haphazard runes to near-perfect imitations of the ones on the telescope as I honed my craft. I hadn’t gone to work during this time. Understandably, I was laid off. But I didn’t care. This was far more pressing at the time. It was then that I began carving the runes onto my walls. My floor. The furniture. The sheer curiosity to see what would happen had my mind in a haze. The stars began to lose any semblance of being any recognisable cosmic phenomenon, having turned even more abstract. Their forms wholly unrecognizable as stars, writhing and swirling, their forms overlapping and folding in on themselves. Whenever I looked outside through my windows or balcony, even through sunlight could the phantom stars be made out, and at night, the sky turned into a beautifully bewildering tapestry of moving colours.

Even when I slept, I would dream about them. Visions that seemed of outer galaxies, of some strange dimension that went beyond the known laws of astrophysics, or perhaps even defied it completely. There were so many mysteries to unearth here, so many truths to discover. Who inscribed these markings onto the telescope in the first place? How did they discover them? Whoever this person was held the answers to the myriad questions bouncing in my head. I had to find them. This kindred spirit of mine, another soul bound tight to the stars, would be the key to understanding the truth behind everything, I thought.

The address the telescope was delivered from was a quaint rural town in the countryside across the country, the kind you would only ever pass by on a trip somewhere else. It was quiet and comfortable - by no means a bad place to live at all. It was also the perfect place to study the stars, uninterrupted by high rise buildings and light pollution. The perfect place for someone likeminded to myself.

So I tidied up my dishevelled appearance in preparation for the first bit of human interaction I’d have in a while, unmounted the telescope and packed it and my journals into my suitcase, alongside the bare essentials I would need on such a long drive. Five hours, and I would have some form of true understanding - at least, that was what I hoped for. 

Little did I know, the truths I would learn would be all too harsh. All too destructive. And most of all, all too beyond mankind’s scope.

A day later I would arrive at the origin of it all. An unassuming, antiquated house well-maintained throughout the decades it stood. Visibly lived in, but with clear signs of care put into its upkeep. As I rapped the door, almost immediately a young man, roughly in his mid 30s, not far off from me, answered the door. He seemed normal enough: neatly dressed, articulate, well-groomed somewhat long hair. His clothes didn’t seem inexpensive, and he looked as if he would fit in better hustling in the streets of some big city - not some old-money house in the middle of nowhere.

“Hey, how can I help you?” he asked as he flashed me a cordial smile.

I rustled through my bag, pulling out the telescope and unwrapping it from its cloth covers. Upon seeing it, his smile turned into a gawk as his brows raised halfway across his forehead. 

“I have questions about this telescope. I believe this was the shipping address, no?”

“Oh shit, I sold that off months ago. So you’re the guy, huh? Man, this is crazy. Yes, this is where that telescope came from. It’s my father’s. A family heirloom, I guess.”

“Your father? Is he still… still with us? I apologise if-”

“No no, it’s fine, and yes, he’s alive. This is his house. I’m just here to visit. I’m off work for the week, and he gets lonely shacked up here all alone. You see, he’s not exactly the man he once was…”

He pointed his finger at the telescope.

“...and it’s because of that thing.”

“Have you ever looked through it?”

“No. I’ve always been too scared to, seeing what it did to my old man. The thing drove him insane. It’s why I pawned it off online - didn’t expect to ever see it again, but here you are, with it in tow. Guess there’s no escaping this family curse, huh.”

“Family curse?”

“Yeah, before it was my dad’s, it was his dad’s. And his dad’s dad’s. It’s been passed through every single son in our family. How old it actually is, I genuinely have no idea. But… I didn’t want any of it. I watched my father turn into a husk of himself the more obsessed he grew with it… And judging by the look on your face, I see you’ve caught a glimpse into its secrets, huh? I’ve kept you out long enough, would you like to come in? Oh, name’s Kurtis, by the way.”

I nodded, and made my way inside. The interior of the house reflected its exterior; old, with a thin layer of dust hanging above everything, but reasonably looked after and loved. Kurtis clearly did his best to honour his family home while he was there. We sat down for a while in the living room, discussing the strange heirloom. Kurtis explained how his father only ever started stargazing through the telescope after his retirement, and early on, it just seemed like a hobby he enjoyed post-retirement. He said that ever since his mother passed, it helped ease his father’s mind.

The comforting embrace of the night sky, getting lost in its splendid lights. But, with every visit, his father’s state seemed to deteriorate. Runic scrawls upon the walls, notes with those same runes littered everywhere. Drawings of nonsensical shapes. Writings of a reality beyond ours. It sounded all too familiar.

“It was ruining him, man. I couldn’t stand to see it anymore… His eyes, they got all fucked up too - I really don’t know what happened. I was scared of that thing, so I sold it for dirt cheap online, just to get it off our hands… I should have just destroyed it, fuck…”

“Your dad, where is he now?”

“Upstairs, in bed. He’s getting better, but in his old age he should really just be resting now… Please, he can’t know that thing is here.” 

Kurtis’ phone began to ring from his jeans pocket. He pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

“Ah shit, work call. I’ll try not to take long. Just stay here for a sec.”

He walked out of the house, out of earshot. Guess he really didn’t want me to hear about his work. But this was the perfect chance. I needed to know more.

So I went upstairs. 

There was a door, slightly ajar. Its time-worn hinges creaked as I pushed past it. In a rustic, ornate bed lay a sweet looking old man swaddled in a blanket, resting his head, sparsely populated with wispy white hairs, upon pillows leaning against the bedframe. His eyes were closed, but he was conscious.

“Son, is that you?”

“No. I’m a visitor. I was the guy that bought the telescope… *your* telescope.”

“Is… Is it here?!” he blurted as he jolted upright in a burst of energy his body seemed physically incapable of producing.

“No. But I have questions. Many, many questions.”

Upon hearing my question, the old man relaxed, and rested against the pillows again.

“The questions you wish to ask… I will not have the answers for. The further you go… The further you reach in, grasping at answers, the more is unknown to you… Listen, boy, destroy that goddamned telescope. Had my son not taken action, who knows what would have become of me. It already took so much… So much I can never, ever, take back.”

He opened his eyes.

As I gazed into them, I could not believe what I saw.

The whites of his eyes, completely gone, replaced by a void. In that void, what looked like stars drew constellations towards his iris. Within his iris, swirling nebulas and twisting galaxies clashing in beautiful chaos. The longer I looked, the more I felt a familiar urge to keep looking. Before I was fully lulled into that trance once more, he closed his eyes, in an act of mercy. What I saw in his eyes is what awaited me, had I continued to toil away at the telescope’s secrets on my own.

“You see, lad, what it has done to me? Even closing my eyes offers no reprieve. Open or closed, I still only see one thing: the truth… Leave, destroy that accursed thing. I can offer you no more.”

He sounded resolute enough. I feel as though I got all I could out of him, and no convincing would make him divulge any more. On my way out, though, I got a glimpse of something. A journal tucked away in his bookshelf, upon its spine, the very same engravings found on the telescope. I carefully slide it out from its neighbouring books, and tucked it into my bag.

“I’m sorry for bothering you… Have a good day, sir,.” I said to the old man as I made my way out of his room.

“Just please, destroy it…” he murmured, half to me, and half to himself, it felt like.

I got everything I could get out of here, I felt. So I left. I walked by Kurtis on my way out outside the front door as he was still on his call.

“Hey man, something came up, I gotta head back,” I said as I passed by him. He gave me an acknowledging nod and waved me off as he continued talking about some business deal over the phone.

I drove a good distance away from the house towards home, and made a stop on the side of the road. I pulled the old man’s journal out from my bag, and began to flick through. The old man was just like me; an avid lover of the cosmos. The journal started off innocent enough, but in a way I was all too familiar with, devolved into unintelligible scrawlings of symbols and shapes - unintelligible to anyone other than someone like me. He had seen similar things, made similar observations, and was similarly enraptured. Except his notes went further than mine. Much, much further. The following is an excerpt of the old man’s journal, towards its very end, at the peak of his insanity. Or rather, the peak of his understanding.

*“How many nights has it been since I last could experience normality? Even after boarding up my windows, their shapes dance in the darkness. Even when I close my eyes do they flicker in the nothingness. They call to me, they yearn for me to glimpse them once more. And so I did. I went outside, this telescope capable of seeing beyond our dimensional constraints, clutched firmly in my hands. I decided I would look deeper into the cosmos than every before. Gaze uninterrupted, fully attempting to comprehend each writhing specter of light, each undulating mass of nebulae, each and every single one of those phantom stars flickering in and out of existence. Perhaps should I gaze at them long enough will I understand their truth.*

*I know not how long I stood there, the frame of the telescope pressed up against the socket of my eye, my vision transfixed through its lens. But I felt it. I was beginning to understand. The plane beyond ours, was so close to me. The true, inner workings of our universe. Those that pull the strings behind every all that has ever happened, and all that has yet to happen. Even as I lay the telescope down, I look up at the night sky, and I see it.*

*An infinite number of eyes. Eyes belonging to those that reside in that transcendental plane. They have glimpsed me as I glimpse them, at last. I have been acknowledged.* 

*I stare at the stars.*

*And the stars stared back.”*

I write all of this a month after my visit to the old man’s house. I’m on the hunt for a new job now, and beginning to piece my life back together. The night sky still calls to me, but I realise that the only remedy for something like this is time. What I had learned will never truly leave me, but I don’tt want it to. After all, the telescope lay idle in its box, tucked away in storage. One day, I’ll continue what the old man couldn’t. To reach the very end. To uncover the truths of our cosmos, and if not me, then someone else.
