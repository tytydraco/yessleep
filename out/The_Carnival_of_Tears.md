The thing about carnivals is the sights and sounds of all things fun! We all had that one carnival we called our favorite and the foods that come with them. But one thing is for sure, when they become abandoned and left for rot, they become a searchers paradise of the unknown thrills.

Zak, Ryan, Derek and Mike made a pact with each other that if we were going to something fun, we'd always do it together, whether it's exploring old abandoned places or going on a fun trip! There was always a reason for doing these adventures, not knowing what they would be getting into!

After hearing of an old abandoned carnival in the woods near their town from one of their other friends, they decided to go find it over the weekend! After they all got back home from school, they started texting each other to figure a way to get in the woods without their parents knowing. They quickly devised the plan, but little did they know, their lives were about to end.

That Friday evening, they met up at the open field next to the woods on the outskirts of town. They made their move right after sundown, making sure no one saw them! After two hours of grueling hiking, they gazed upon the target they were after!!

"ClearWater Carnival" is what the sign said nearest to the old run down ticket booth

"Lets go in and explore!" said Derek, flashlight in hand!!

"I.........................I dont know about this guys. It fells off!" said Zak, shaking and trying to get a better look.

They all decided to go in and check out the place, and right as they got inside, all of them felt an ominous feeling! The whole place lit up like it hadn't missed a day!

"Dude, lets get out of here!" Said Mike, but no one listened!

They were all in shock at this and no one knew of the danger that was in front of them! Thats when they saw the sights!

BLOODY BODIES! Bodies strewn everywhere! Used as prizes in games, child bodies strewn like puppets and bodies used as seats on most of the rides!

The boys ran but didnt get far!

"WHERES THE EXIT!" said Zak, visibly freaked out!

"IDK, just run and search, we'll find it!" said Ryan

They heard a BIG crash behind them, and saw the clown! He was drenched in blood, and carried a large axe! He gazed at the four boys, smiled the biggest smile they'd ever seen, then came charging after them!

"RUN, GO GO GO GO!!" They all yelled, and they didn't make it very far! The clown was too fast

He hit Zak with one swing and killed him instantly! The other boys tried to fight back but no luck! The clown got the best of them too! They all ended up part of that carnival, but no one knows where!

I still remember the newspaper stories the next day of the four boys that went missing! The next day at school, I overheard one of the seniors touting that he had done the bloodiest scam ever. I never said anything, and rightfully so, because I learned a few days later that the same senior was arrested for trespassing at Zak's house!

That goes to show you, never trust your friends, no matter who they are!
