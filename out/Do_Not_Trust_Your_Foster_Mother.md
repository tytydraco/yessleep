DO NOT TRUST YOUR FOSTER MOM



That was the subject of the email. The sender of the email was blank. It was a white space where an email address should be. It should have been marked as spam, right? Yet, it rested both pinned and starred at the top of my email. I need your help, reader. Should I believe them, and if so, what should I do? 



The first line of the email said, "Read your attachments in order". 



I yelled, "Mo—" to call my foster mother and then slammed my mouth shut. 



My foster mother was a good woman, in my opinion, a great woman, and I should know.I've lived in seven different homes, and I've only wanted to be adopted by one person, my current foster mother. I've only called one matriarch "mother," my current foster mother. She was the only good person I had in my life, and even she couldn't be trusted, according to this email. That's what scared me. 



Sheer fear gripped my chest. I gnawed at my fingers, a habit I thought I had abandoned in my new home. My stomach ached. I was sixteen, a tough sixteen-year-old, and I felt like a child again in the worst way. Another adult wanted to hurt me.



My insides were messed up. I wanted to be left alone and never see anyone again, and at the same time, I wanted to be hugged, have my hair brushed, and told everything would be okay. 



I slammed my laptop shut and ignored the email. I didn't want to know the truth. I didn't delete it. I couldn't delete it. I had to know. However, I did my best to ignore it. I lasted six hours. I opened it half an hour ago today, and this is what I saw. 



The email sender wrote: 

Hello, I have something big to ask you. It's going to involve a lot of trust, but I need that from you, and I have proof to present to you at the end. I need you to kill your foster mom. If you need a gun, I'll get you a gun. If you need poison, I'll get you poison. If you need a grenade launcher, I'll have it to you by Tuesday. Trust me.



Your foster mother killed my daughter. My daughter isn't coming back. I don't care about your foster mother going to prison. I don't care about justice. I want revenge. Before you become a coward or self-righteous, I want you to read this. Read this as a mother, and then you tell me what you'd do if it were your daughter. 

Attachment 1- written in the penmanship of a 13-year-old girl. Hearts over I's and all that.

Hi, Mom and Dad, this is Ivy. I'm leaving because everyone treats me like crap and I'm tired of it. I'm not exactly sure why everyone does. I just know they do. Okay, I don't know everyone in our town, but it feels like everyone in our town does. In the last few weeks, I've met someone outside of town, and they like me. We've been talking every night while Dad's sleeping and you're out of town, Mom. Anyway, I'll be with them soon. Don't worry, they're a responsible adult; they're older than both of you. 

I haven't told anyone about them yet because they asked me to keep them a secret. They said soon they'll either come to my town for me or they'll teach me how to get to them. Anyway, I'm writing this letter to let you know, Mom and Dad, I'm okay. And don't worry, they're a good person. I know it in my heart. Let me tell you how this got started.

So, remember how I told you guys my favorite book was "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"? Yeah, so the edition you gave me was great, but the cover is from the movie and not the original art. I'm grateful for the one you gave me. I'll take it with me when I leave, buttttt… It's my favorite book by my favorite author, so I needed one with the original cover. So, anyway, I stole it. Please, don't be mad. The story gets better from here. 

So, I open the book. It was nice and chilly, and I snuggled under my covers. I didn't lay in the bed though. I was in my covers under the window and let the illumination from the moon and street lamps outside give me enough light to read. I was at the part where Eustace Scrubb enters the dragon's lair. He's a miserable guy at this point. He has zero-likable qualities, so the tension is high and I'm excited to watch him get what he deserves. I'm reading a scene I ABSOLUTELY know , and BOOM, I arrive on a nearly blank page. 

The only words were dead center on the page, blood red, and they said, "Hello, Ivy."

SMACK

I slammed the book shut and threw it across my room.

"Shut up, Ivy!" Dad yelled at me from his room. "I'm trying to sleep."

"Sorry," I whispered back. I was afraid the book could hear me. I buried myself in my covers and watched it.

That book was the first and last thing I ever stole. I really wondered if it knew something. If C.S. Lewis put a Christian spell on it to punish kids who stole. I opened my mouth to pray Psalm 23 then shut my mouth because I realized God was probably mad at me for stealing. I did pray though! I promised I would return the book, and I begged God to not let me get in trouble. I wondered if it was a magic book that was going to tell the store, tell the police, or worst of all, tell you guys. That last part scared me. I know I'd never hear the end of it. And honestly...

You guys can be pretty mean. You play dirty when you're mad at me. It's like you want to hurt my feelings, and I know you'd be so embarrassed if you heard your kid was a thief. Like, I still remember everything you said to me when I got detention for that one fight in school. You knew I was being bullied all that school year, and I finally stood up for myself. And you guys still told me how much of an embarrassment I was and that I bring it on myself sometimes. That's mean.

Anyway, yeah, so I was scared to hear that again, and it got cold, really cold.  And I'm sitting there afraid to move, and I hold myself in the cold. I wasn't going to open it, but as I shivered, I got lonely, scared, and curious. I crawled forward toward the book. I pushed it open and flipped to that same page again.

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, Ivy." The new words on the page said.

SMACK

I slammed the book closed. I made that 'eek' sound that you guys make fun of me for. I crawled back to my covers in the corner in the moonlight.

Dad heard it and yelled at me. "Ivy!!"

"Sorry," I whispered again. I listened to the sound of my breathing and the crickets outside, and then, for a third time, I opened it. 

"Everything okay, Ivy?" the words said. 

"Uh, yes," I whispered to it. "Are you mad at me?"

"No, dear. I could never be mad at you," the words changed again. The initial set disappeared, and then the new words wandered onto the page as if they were hand-written. 

"Oh..." I whispered, relieved. "How can you speak?"

The words vanished, and new words came on the page. 

"That is complicated. Unfortunately, I'm trapped in this book."

"Oh, no! I'm sorry. How can I get you out?" 

"You're sweet, dear. There will be time for that. Just wait. You've grown into such a lovely girl."

"You know me?"

"Yes," the words said, and I paused. 

"Who are you?"

"Take a guess, sweetheart." These words were written with surprising speed. She said she saw I had grown, so that meant it was someone older. And they were someone who could never be mad at me.

"Granny?" I asked the book.

"Yes. I'm your granny. You haven't seen me for a long time, have you?" 

"No," I said. I honestly don't remember us visiting granny. I remember her coming by once. She told me the truth about you though, so I see why you don't let me visit her. 

"Are you really my grandma?" I asked.

"Absolutely."

"Prove it."

This time it paused for a while. I almost called out to it again, but I didn't want to call it granny if it wasn't really granny. Then finally, Granny wrote again.

"Look in your heart," the page said. "Look in your heart, and you'll know the truth." 

And I did. I promise you. I looked in my heart and knew she was my grandmother. Like when I asked you about Jesus, Mom. How did you know he was real? And you said, "You just know that you know, that you know. Deep in your heart somewhere."

And like my Muslim friend Abir, I asked her why she was so convinced that Mohammad was the prophet and Islam was the truth. She said she had this deep peace and joy in her heart when she prayed.

I had that. I believed in my heart she was my grandma.

"Where have you been?" I asked Granny.

"I've been trapped. Bad men locked me away."

"It wasn't Dad, was it?" 

The words didn't come for a minute. My heart pounded. I think you and Mom are mean, but I didn't want to believe you could do this. This was too far. Finally, the red ink appeared.

"How did you know?" Granny said. "You're so clever, like your mom used to be." 

"I just did! He can be mean," It felt good for someone to encourage me. 

"Yes, and unfortunately, he's involved with your mother as well." 

"Oh, no. How can I help?"

"You speaking with me has helped a lot."

"Thanks, granny. Is there anything else?"

"Well, you can get me out of here."

"Really?"

"How?"

"Oh, it'll take a few weeks or so. You just have to get me a few things." 

Attachment 2- sloppily written perhaps by an older person.

My parents did not receive that letter. Excuse my poor spelling or miswritten words. It is painful to write now. My fingers are withered, my back aches, and it hurts to breathe. If anyone was around me, they'd hear it. They'd hear my big labored breaths, but I am alone on the floor. I tried to write at my desk, but I stumbled over. 

"Help," I begged.

"Help," I whimpered.

"Help," I only thought because it was the same as my cries.

No one would be around to hear it anyway. I lay on the floor downtrodden and defeated. Even gravity's lazy pull-outmuscled me now. 

It took a month. I gathered everything she needed. A strange cane that was in some thrift store, a heartfelt letter saying how kind she was to me, a letter saying that she was going to help me with a problem I had, and a letter that said she was a reformed citizen. I stuffed the letters inside the book. They disappeared in a melted mess. It was like the paper turned into wax.

She crawled out face first. It hurt to watch. I imagine it was painful like a baby's birth except no crying, no blood, no stickiness. She came out in silence, smiling, and with skin as dry as a rock. Once her face was out, her neck pulsed and stretched to free itself. 

Then came her shoulders draped in an orange sweater the color of a setting sun. And I thought that was fitting because I knew my life was about to change. Her arms followed, and then her chest, and then eventually her whole body. My eyes never left what rested on her body though, that horrible sweater.

I screamed. I yelled and crawled away from the book until I hit my wall and my voice went hoarse.

"Ivy!" Dad yelled, and his voice broke me. He wasn't mad but concerned. He banged on the door, demanding to be let in, but it was locked and I was incapable of moving forward. If I moved forward, I might get closer to that thing coming from the book. Dad banged and pushed the door. It didn't budge.

"Ivy!" he yelled, scared for his only daughter. My eyes could not leave the strange woman's sweater.

People were on her sweater. Living people! Probably around my age. They were two-dimensional, misshapen, and sewn into the fabric, like living South Park characters. They all had oversized heads, sickly slender bodies, and eyes that dashed from left to right. Every eye on the sweater looked at me. Robbed of mouths, they had to use single black lines to speak. All of them made an ominous O.

"Granny?"

"Hello, child," she said. Her back was bent. Not like a hunchback but like a snake before it strikes. "You said your town was bothering you, child? I have a gift for you." She picked up the cane before her.

The door clattered open. Dad jumped in, bat in hand. He swung it once; the air was his only victim. He breathed ferocious, chaotic breaths. I wanted to push him out of the room in a big hug and we both pretend this scary woman didn’t exist. 

"Ivy! Ivy!" he cried. His eyes didn't land on me. He was too panicked. I never saw him so scared.

The woman's eyes didn't leave him. They went up and down his petrified body.

"I'm sorry," she said. "Are you from this town?"

"Where's my daughter?" he barked at her.

"So, you live here then? This is your house? I don't mean to be rude. I only mean to do my job. Nothing more. I'm reformed after all," everything she said was so arrogant, so sarcastic, and demeaning. 

"Where's Ivy!"

"Yes, yes. Broken door and to speak with such authority and without regard for my questions... you must be the man of the house." 

She tapped her cane once. Her body left the room. Dad looked for it and found me instead. We locked eyes. I was mute and scared. He tossed his bat away. He ran to me. I pushed my covers off and lept to him, wanting one of his bear hugs more than anything. 

The old woman appeared behind him. She floated in the air. She smacked his ribs with the cane.

BOOM!

SPLAT!

He went flying into my wall. His body bounced off it and landed on my bed where it bounced again, unconscious.

The woman smiled at me and shrugged once, then tapped her cane again, and she was gone. 

The screaming started in my brother's room, and then my dog yelped in my garage, and then the neighbors screamed, and then the whole neighborhood screamed. 

That whole time, Dad was still breathing, his body bent and distorted into a horrible V shape. He shuddered. He sweated. He leaked from all over, from his mouth and his bowels. 

I am a monster, Mom. I am so sorry. I did not ask for this. I asked her to stop everyone from being so mean.

The woman. The liar. The woman who was not my grandmother did come back for me at the end of the night. She stole my youth. Time shredded and slashed at my body. I shrunk and ached and gasped as my future was stolen. My hair grew, grayed, and then fell away. My body ached for sex and then love, and then I only wanted to be held. 

She said I didn't have much longer. Three days and then I would end up as another soul on her sweater. I am so sorry, Mom.

Attachment 3 -

It was a picture of my foster mom. It was all wrong. 

I didn't know my heart could beat this fast. I typed on my phone under my covers and with my dresser pressed against the door for my safety. Sorry, sorry, I don’t know why I’m apologizing you’re not here with me.

 I keep retyping everything because I miss letters because my hands won't stop shaking. My mouth's dry. I'm so thirsty, but I won't leave this room. I still say it has to be Photoshop, some sort of Photoshop that affects everything because after I saw it, I walked into her room and there was the sweater! Below is a note from the email writer that I'm struggling to click. I really can't take anymore. I really don't know what this is**,** but I don't want it anymore. I want off!

I say all that, but I read the note anyway: 

*You see it now, don't you? Who your foster mother is. Next time you see her, she'll be wearing that sweater. Don't be embarrassed you didn't notice until now. She can disguise herself. She can make you think you've known her forever. But now that you've seen a picture of her, you know what she is.*

*She is the Old Soul. She isn't from this world. She's from a world where many are as cruel and powerful as her. Don't think I'm getting on my high horse. I know I'm cruel, as well. I know I neglected my daughter. I didn't love her as I should, so she fell right into the arms of the first person who was kind to her.* 

*I bet you think I'm a terrible parent after all of that , huh? Well, welcome to the club. It's only me and you in there, and we aren't recruiting new members.  Our only goal is to give Satan your mother back, except screaming, full of holes, and missing a limb or two. Then I'm following her to keep doing the same thing for all eternity. Are you in? I need an answer.*

Guys, I need your help. Up until now, my foster mother has been perfect. What should I do?
