I finally received an updated witness list for my upcoming disbarment hearing. The ‘surprise witness’ that caused the delay is my former managing partner, Kara Young.

I think it’s worth mentioning that she was let go from the firm shortly after the events of [my last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fmhiyo/tales_at_law_the_last_will_and_testament/). In fact, I haven’t seen nor heard from her since. She’s been a ghost in the wind.

Let me tell you why.

-

After everything that happened with the Kellerman family, I was fearful of returning to the work, so I took a short vacation down the coast (I won’t mention which one to yinz). 

I continued receiving calls from the young Kellerman, Jacob. I stopped picking up after a while, even tried changing my number, my phone, and my carrier. He kept calling anyway. 

He left voicemails too. Sometimes, they were filled with silence, offering nothing but tension, waiting for Jacob to speak, before eventually ending with a click of his receiver. Other times, he spoke in that same low, raspy voice. He would beg for help in cooling the fires of the Kellerman family. I stopped listening to those as well.

When I was ready, I returned to work. I finally felt like I could confront Kara and find some clarity as to her role and knowledge of the Kellermans.

I got in early, hoping to catch her before the day ramped up. She didn’t come in. I absentmindedly worked through the case load that had piled up on my desk during my absence. For hours, I would stand in the doorway to my office, staring at Kara’s closed office door, impatient for her to return.

One night, I got my wish. I was in the office much later than usual, accompanied only by the ticking clocks and the auto light present in my office.

I hadn’t slept right since the Kellerman meeting, my vacation doing little to ease my nerves. Jacob’s warning plagued my sleep deprived mind. On top of my lackluster sleep, I was falling behind at work. 

So, I stayed late to catch up, putting Kara at the back of mind. I figured if I wasn’t going to sleep anyway, I might as well try to salvage my job.

I must have dozed off. I woke up disoriented, my computer was asleep, my office was dark — the auto light had switched itself off. I fumbled with my smart watch, tapping the screen several times and turning my wrist this way and that before it revealed that it was just past midnight.

Then I heard it, the unmistakable click of an auto light down the hall. I froze, my nerves were shot, endless possibilities of who it could be ran through my mind. 

Another click, different this time, from the latch on a door.

Silently, I rose from my chair, neck stiff from my brief nap. I slowly made my way towards the door. My auto light clicked on causing me to flinch. Pausing, I took a few uneven, nervous breaths to calm myself.

An unmistakable smell punctuated the air, stale cigarettes. Alarm bells sounded in my head but I couldn’t quite place why. Gathering my courage, I peeked out of my door. My eyes darted from office to office before settling on an office door with light pouring through the crack beneath it.

My heart rate slowed as I realized it was just another associate. I let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

Slinking back into my office, I slumped down into my chair. I rubbed my eyes and clicked my computer back on, hoping to eke out a little more work.

Another click from down the hall, it barely registered through my exhaustion. 

Tap, tap, tap — that sound caught my attention. The unmistakable tap of heels on tile. I looked up just in time to catch Kara strutting past, several files clutched tightly in her manicured hands. 

I shoved my chair back from the desk and jumped from my seat, narrowly avoiding tripping over an extension cord running the length of my office. 

Tap, tap, tap — click. 

I caught sight of her cherry red heels disappearing into the stairwell at the end of the hall.

“Kara!”

I called out after her and rushed towards the stairwell. Flinging the door open, I called her name again.

I looked down the gap between the stairs. I should have been able to see her descending but was greeted only by dim fluorescent lights. The smell of cigarettes filled my nose, taunting me… or maybe beckoning me to follow.

I flew down the stairs, taking them two at a time, and opened the door to the parking lot. I looked around, desperately searching for Kara. She was nowhere to be found.

I sighed, resigned, and turned to head back up the stairs when something caught the corner of my eye.

A half-smoked cigarette had been hastily stamped out against the pavement. Its embers dimly glowed. 

I bent down to inspect the remnants of the cigarette, its acrid scent still pungent in the air. The sight of the embers made my stomach church. This wasn’t just any old cigarette; it was a branch I had seen Kara smoke. My instincts creamed that something was terribly wrong.

An uneasy feeling crept over me. I retraced my steps back up the stairs, each footfall echoing my apprehension. 

As I reached the top of the stairs, I glanced at my watch. It was nearing 1:00 AM. The firm was beginning to feel more like my tomb than an office. I needed to find Kara.

Pushing through the door to the main floor, I paused, taking in the oppressive silence. The lights flicked on one by one as I made my way gingerly back to my office, casting eerie shadows across the empty desks and offices. I took a deep breath and headed towards the office Kara had been in, hoping it would contain some answers.

As I approached the still lit office, I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. The door was slightly ajar, and the dim light inside flickered sporadically. I knocked lightly before stepping in, images of her rifling through case files danced in my mind despite knowing she was long gone.

Instead, the office was in disarray. Papers were strewn across the floor, and the desk was littered with empty coffee cups filled with butts — some still smoldering. It all felt… wrong, like I was staring at a snapshot of her unraveling.

The air was heavy with the smell of stale smoke, intensifying the dread I felt.

I fingered through the scattered files, looking for something — anything — that might explain her frantic behavior. My hands brushed against an unlabeled, thick, manila folder. Opening it, I was greeted by the unsettling sight of notes, emails, and printed conversations related to the Kellerman case. None of which were present in the case file she had given me and some of which mentioned me…

My heart raced as I read through the documents. Kara had been in contact with Jacob’s family long before they had approached our firm. The notes suggested she had been embezzling from the Kellerman account, and that Jacob had caught her.

Why? What could drive her to this?

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from down the hall, snapping me out of my thoughts. I turned, adrenaline surging as I ducked behind the desk.

I strained my ears, listening out for any sign of movement. I heard muffled voices coming from the direction of the conference room. 

Crouching, I snuck out of the office, fueled by a mixture of fear and curiosity. I reached the door to the conference room and peeked around the corner just as the lights flickered on. Inside, a group of the firm’s partners was gathered, their expressions mirrored that of the Kellerman’s, anger. I caught snippets of the conversation.

“Unbelievable,” one of them said, his voice rising. “She thought she could play us? We can’t let this slide.”

“We need to cut ties NOW! I’ll get the ball rolling with HR,” another partner responded.

Panic course through me. I slipped back into the shadows, straining to hear more. Their voices grew more heated, discussing the consequences of Kara’s actions, how her interference had hurt the firm.

“We have to fire her before it gets out.”

The implications of their words hit me like a truck. Kara had betrayed not only the Kellermans, but her colleagues. The consequences of which were crashing down on her. 

A sickening feeling washed over me, I realized that Kara had tried to manipulate me as well. She had distanced herself from the Kellerman family while lining her pockets in the process.

“If she reaches out to anyone outside the firm, we need to make sure she understands what’s at stake. She cannot ruin us.”

The door to the conference room swung open and I retreated back to the office she had been searching through, not wanting the partners to know I was there. 

Pushing open the door to the office once more, I found something that stopped me cold. A small tape recorder, seemingly forgotten on the window sill, the kind used for dictation.

A red light on its side was blinking. I clicked it on, hearing the last moments of a frantic conversation play back. Kara’s voice, raw with panic, spoke hurriedly, “I’m not going down for this. I’ll fix it, I promise.”

The response chilled me. Jacob’s rough, raspy voice came through, pleading but firm, “You don’t understand. They will ruin you if you keep this up. You need to end this.”

The tape ended abruptly, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. Kara had woven the web but only caught herself, and now it was too late for her to escape…

The next day, news broke that Kara had been officially fired from the firm, her name dragged through the mud on the local news. She became a cautionary tale, a shadow hanging over the firm.

Now, I was going to see her face-to-face once more when she testified at my hearing, and I had no idea what she might say.
