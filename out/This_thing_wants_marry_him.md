Gibson woke up in the middle of the night—something he hated. Going back to sleep wasn’t an option, so he figured he might as well watch something on TV.

He went to the living room, turned on the TV, and flipped through random channels. At this hour, only strange content played—it felt like some kind of DeepTV. He kept switching channels, hoping to find something decent, until one in particular caught his attention.

This one showed a gray screen, with a figure standing still, draped in a cloak that covered its entire body.

Gibson wanted to change the channel, but his curiosity was stronger. The figure on the screen began moving closer, step by step. As it neared, he started hearing footsteps in the living room. The closer the figure got to the screen, the louder the footsteps became—until the TV suddenly turned off.

Now, the footsteps were right in front of the TV. From that moment, he had the eerie feeling that there were more people in the room. But after a few minutes, everything fell silent—until the TV turned back on. When he looked at the screen, the figure was gone. Only a gray background remained. But when he glanced above the TV, the figure was sitting there, staring down at him.

Then, it jumped off the TV, lunged at him, and began strangling him.

In a panic, Gibson flailed his arms wildly, knocking the remote to the floor and turning off the TV. The figure vanished. Trembling and drenched in sweat, he tried turning on the lamp. It flickered on, but the room remained dark. That’s when he noticed the walls—they were covered in a strange black liquid.

He tried calling the police, but when he unlocked his phone, the figure was there on the screen. This time, he could see its owl-like eyes and… no teeth. It stared at him and then spoke:

"Turn on the TV, Gibson. Turn it on. Come with me forever—isn’t that what you wanted?"

"Sarah? How are you here? You died..."

"Yes, but I still have the wedding ring. I came to take you to the altar… with a very special priest."

She turned toward the kitchen window, and Gibson saw the silhouette of a tall, horned man staring at him.

The man—or creature—shattered the window and climbed inside, holding a bloody shovel. Before it could reach him, Gibson bolted, running as fast as he could out of the house.

It was pouring rain, but he didn’t care. His phone fell to the ground, and before he could pick it up, the creature was already sprinting toward him. He had nowhere to go—he lived in an almost isolated area, surrounded by forest. Then, in the distance, he spotted a light.

He ran toward it and found an altar, with a massive coffin at its center. Written on it were messages like:

"Where were you?"
"Wasn’t I good enough for you?"

Meanwhile, a distorted wedding song played in the background.

When he turned around, the Horned Man was there. Without effort, he struck Gibson in the head with the shovel. Gibson collapsed, dazed, his vision blurry—but he could still see the creature digging a hole, nearly 23 feet deep.

Then he saw her—Sarah, in her wedding dress, covered in insects, dirt, and mold.

After finishing the hole, the man lifted Gibson, dressed him in a black groom’s suit, and threw him into the coffin. Sarah climbed in beside him.

The man picked up a pitch-black book and spoke:

"Do you take her as your wife, until you never again see the light of the sun?"

Gibson’s mouth moved on its own, answering for him:
"Yes, I do. Until I never see the light again."

"And you, madam? Do you take this man, until you are reunited beneath the earth?"

"Yes! Let’s go, Gibson… where no one will ever see us again, where no one can stop our wedding… where the living go… but never return to speak, breathe, or be heard again."

The man declared: "The union is sealed."

The hole began to widen, deeper than before. The creature approached them, lifted the coffin, and carried it to the edge. When Gibson looked down, he couldn’t believe his eyes—below were the rotting corpses of other brides and grooms.

The man closed the coffin. Sarah laughed uncontrollably in excitement, while Gibson sobbed in despair.

He felt the coffin being lowered into the hole. Outside, he heard hands pounding against the wood.

Sarah whispered: "Don’t worry… soon, you won’t need to hear, speak, or move anymore. Soon… you’ll be just like me. Until death joins us… forever."

The last thing Gibson heard was the sound of dirt pouring into the grave.

The End.
