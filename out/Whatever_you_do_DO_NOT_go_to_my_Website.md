I'm writing this in a desperate plea to anyone that may know me or happen to be around me. If you see me, whatever you do, do not go to my website. 

Now that that's out of the way, most of you may wonder why I'm asking this of you. It's a lot to explain, but I can't take the chance that this will happen to anyone else.

About a couple months ago I lost my job. Thanks to budget cuts, I was tossed out onto the street without so much as a warning. As you might guess I was pissed, but what the hell could I have done?

I slammed the door to my apartment shut and kicked the shoes off my feet into the wall as if they were the ones that fired me. I slumped into my couch with a deep sigh and rubbed my face with both hands. A small meow jutted me out of my emotional state and I looked down at my cat, Grover. My best friend in the entire world, I had adopted him when I went to the shelter. The poor little guy only had three legs. That never stopped him though, he was still as graceful as any other cat.

Patting my lap, I beckoned him up. He gladly did so with a purr and I ran my hand through his soft black fur. I relaxed and closed my eyes, letting myself sink into his rumbles. Grover, at that point, was the only thing keeping me going.

After allowing myself to calm down, I opened my eyes to scroll through my phone. I knew I had to find a new job quickly, but one app in particular was calling my name. Clicking on YouTube I proceeded to start doom-scrolling shorts, still stroking my best friend. I willed myself to zone out and forget about the days events, that is, until a particular short crossed my feed. 

"Are you a sad and lonely person?" the person in the video asked. "Are you looking to change your life for the better?"

I rolled my eyes, I've seen this kind of influencer before. They claimed they could change your life, if only you paid them your entire life savings of course.

"You're in luck, my depressing friend!" The guy continued. "For the low low price of FREE you can completely remove yourself from your current life!"

"Oh, for FREE, huh?" I laughed, mockingly. I looked at Grover with a smile. "This guy is a total scam artist, eh boy?"

Grover didn't respond, just stared at me waiting for the pets to continue. I obliged.

"I know what you're thinking, this guy is a total scam artist, huh?" The influencer wagged his finger while shaking his head.

"Ok, creepy" I chuckled. But despite the absurdity, I decided to continue watching.

"I can assure you, my process is completely free. Just visit my website and you can learn how to leave your old life behind like a toxic ex!" The guy then proceeded to spell out his website's address several times, like he was making sure it was ingrained into my skull.

Probably out of pure boredom, I was convinced to visit the site. The page was completely devoid of color. I squinted my eyes as the bright white background burned my retnas.

"Why the hell doesn't anyone make their websites dark mode?" I grumble.

After blinking a couple of times, the only thing I see on the page is reviews. Each one had five star ratings with people raving about how they're enjoying their new lives and how much this guy helped them. I figured that they were probably bot accounts, Dead Internet was running rampant.

Scrolling through the reviews I finally landed at the end of the page. It had one question for me.

"Are you ready for your new life?"

I was about to click on the "Yes" button, purely from curiosity, when Grover started growling. I tore my eyes away from my phone to look down at him. His yellow eyes stared back at me, seemingly annoyed. I put down my phone and proceeded to scratch the ear he normally couldn't scratch because of his missing leg. Satisfied, he leaned into my hand, purring once again.

I then forgot about that site for some time after that.

After what felt like an eternity of searching, I had gotten no leads for a new job. Apparently the jobs that always seemed to be urgently hiring have really high standards. Unlucky for me, I guess. Rubbing the bridge of my nose in anxious defeat, I suddenly felt the urge to visit that website again.

Disappointed in myself for even considering asking for help from what could be considered as an alpha male podcaster, I go to type in the website. To my surprise, the website is already in my tabs. I must have forgotten to close out of it.

I swept past the reviews to the bottom like I did before, but instead of the question being there, it asked for my name and age. Being completely broke and useless to society, I shrugged off any fear that getting my identity stolen would help anyone. I typed in my information and pressed enter.

I was sent to a loading screen for what felt like minutes until a message appeared.

"Thank you for choosing us! We hope you join the list of satisfied customers!"

I waited for something else to happen, but nothing came. Rolling my eyes at the waste of time, I got up to go feed my cat.

As soon as I filled his bowl, I heard a knock at my door. I froze, debating where I could hide from social interaction. I slowly tip-toed over to my door and looked through the peephole.

No one was there.

Keeping the latch on the door, I cracked it open. On the ground before me was a plain white box. The only thing on it was my first name marked in big black letters, like someone let their 3 year old send mail.

I unlatched the door and stepped out into the empty hallway. Glancing around, I picked up the box and scurried back inside. The pure confusion of receiving the package was enough to drown out the fact that I could be holding a bomb.

Shaking that thought from my brain, I tentatively removed the scotch tape on the box and lifted the lid. I blinked a couple times at the inside contents of this random box.

"What the..." I trail off as I pick up the white, labelless bottle. Underneath was literally just a post-it note stuck to the inside of the box.

"Consume once a day! :)"

Yeah, like I was going to take random pills from some random person who draws smiley faces on post-its.

"Who even sent this?" I asked no one as I turned the box over, searching for any clue as to where it came from.

As if it heard me, I got a notification on my phone.

"Congratulations! You are about to start your path to a new life!"

I legit thought I was going crazy at this point. It felt like I was being pranked and any moment now a camera crew would burst in. Whoever sent this must think I'm desperate.

Little did I know how right they were.

Weeks passed and I still had no luck in finding a job, I was starting to feel like my only solution was to make a social media account for my cat. That's when I got another notification on my phone.

"Start finding your way to your new life, and you'll receive amazing compensation!"

I read the text over and over, furrowing my brow in concentration. I read those words like money would suddenly fly out of the screen.

Giving a apprehensive sigh, I grab the pill bottle. Grover meows at me curiously.

"Welp, if I die, I give you permission to eat me" I state as if he could understand me. Hesitating for a moment, I pop the pill into my throat and down it with water.

As I was deeply regretting my decisions in life, I once again heard my phone. What I saw made me choke on my own breath and sent me into a coughing spree.

Five thousand dollars had been transferred into my account.

I stared, dumbfounded. I then closed my eyes slapped myself to wake up from this dream... but when I opened them, the money was still there.

Ignoring how downright creepy it was that these people seemed to know my every move, I continued to take a pill daily. With every one I took, my bank account threw a party. I started feeling stronger, faster, and fitter. My body felt like brand new, and it was as though I could run for hundreds of miles without getting tired. I had more confidence than ever!

My doubts for these pills had been tossed away as I continued to improve every day. The money I gained was partly used to get the best gadgets and toys for cats. Grover and I were living like royalty, and all I had to do was take a little pill every day.

I realized a couple days ago that I was on the last pill. I held it in the palm of my hand, anxiety creeping into my brain.

What if this was the last pill they're sending me? What was all of this even for? Why was this even happening?

I looked at the small white tablet for a few more seconds before swallowing it.

The moment I blinked, I found myself in a white room, devoid of anything but a tall window. I rubbed my eyes, believing myself to be hallucinating, but I was still stuck in that white void.

I run over to the window and look out, but for some reason the only thing I saw was... my ceiling?

I called out, screamed, banged my hands into the window. Fear sweeping over me. Then, a full sense of dread hit me like a truck as I saw myself look at me. The other me picked up my void and tapped on the window in precise movements and strokes.

That's when I realised, I was in my phone. It wasn't a window, it was my phone screen. I pressed my hands onto the screen and yelled at myself to notice me.

The thing that appeared to be me never even gave me so much as a glance. It just sat the phone down and stood before it. I could see my cat hissing at this imposter and I started sobbing. I needed to get out, I needed to get to my best friend.

The imposter proceeded to speak.

"Are you a sad and lonely person? Are you looking to change your life for the better?"

I couldn't bear to watch anymore of this. Standing there, shaking, I hoped and prayed that this was some kind of sick joke or a dream.

On the screen, a question appeared. But it wasn't facing outside, it was faced towards me.

"Would you like to start your new life?"

Desperate to get put of here, I pressed the yes button, which was a lot bigger now that I was trapped behind the screen.

"Congratulations! You are now one thousand six hundred eighty second in line for our New Life Waitlist!"

Please, for the love of God, if you see my videos, if you see me on the street, DO NOT GO TO MY WEBSITE.
