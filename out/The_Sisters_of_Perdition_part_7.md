I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found another journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.  


  
My name is Ewan and I live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained under our leader Max since I received a halo. I was 25. It was 1865.  
Our monastery kept in contact with the cesareans and I was able to buy ammo for the weapons I had acquired. 
 
Much like 4 years ago our monastery was holding a meeting today. The American civil war had been long and bloody but the south was on the run. They had turned Dixie into an impenetrable fortress and the north was laying siege to it. They were calling for all available troops to gather outside Dixie for an assault.  

The north had gained the upper hand mainly through numbers. Though the south and north had at one point had similar populations the casualties of the 2 changeling crises had changed that. More than 2 thirds of military aged men in the south had been lost too the two crises.  

On top of that the north had utilized a new invention to deal with the gator animals and wendigos. The Gatling gun was remarkably effective on both accounts and had helped the north against Dora’s creations.  

That morning I sat beside the water, praying with my mentor Max. We were both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us. 
 
“The orcas will return,” Alziza said from behind us. 
 
I opened my eyes and within moments saw the pod of orcas coming into shore.  

Me and Max swam out to the orca pod and before long we were surfing as I had before.  
Max spoke loudly as we surfed along the river. “You know in my entire life I have only gone for 29 of these orca rides! How many are you up too child?”
  
“This is only my third.” I responded playfully.  

“Well why don’t we take this opportunity to go over some things! You’ll remember it better because we are surfing I assure you." Max said with a grin. 
 
“Sure.” I responded. 
 
“Well now.” Max started. “Charlemagne the Great was the first since the fall of Rome to rediscover the phasing power. Do you know who Charlemagne reincarnated as?” 
 
“Napoleon Bonaparte of course” I responded, rolling my eyes.  

“He was brilliant!” Max exclaimed. “In a world of traitors the only logical response is personal liberty! Let no one else have control over thee! It’s such a shame Napoleon didn’t practice what he preached. His own personal liberty went too far... Now then, the watchers! “ Max hacked and spat in the water, then paused.  

“What about them?” I asked. 
 
“They are a reminder to us all. No matter how powerful you think you are, if you turn against Yahweh, the law of this world will come for you. You have read the book of Enoch, no?” Max asked. 
 
I looked at the willow trees as we surfed by. “Of course.”  

“The watchers thought that Yahweh would come himself to expel them. Instead he sent Enoch. He was the messiah of the pre flood humans, much like Jesus christ is our Messiah. Yahweh sent a junior kindergartner to expel an entire grade of 9th graders if you want to think of it like our school.” Max monologed.  

“It is said that men lived a up to 1000 years before the deluge. Why did Yahweh shorten our lives so much?” I asked. 
 
“Death can be a blessing down here. People are so evil that it is necessary Yahweh doesn’t give us that much control. If we lived 1000 years there would be men in cages for 900 I tell you. These people are all evil, child. Trust no one fully.” Max monologed. 
 
Before long we returned to the monastery and swam to shore. Alziza was waiting for us.  

“The tides pull out. We must be ready to ride them to victory.” Alziza said, with death in his eyes.  

We gathered all the monks from the monastery and began our journey to Dixie, rendezvousing with the monks from other monasteries on the way.  

By the time we started seeing gator deer we had a force of 300 monks.  

We arrived at Abraham's Lincoln’s encampment the following day. I noted that the old fella had finally gotten his halo. Just as he had said 4 years ago he had 40,000 troops encircling Dixie. Thus far they had not been able to breach the city, being repelled every time they tried.  

Abraham and all his Generals gathered that night to speak with Max. They were plotting a plan of attack when Alziza brought an idea to the table. 
 
“We shall strike at sunrise with all available troops. IT will be a long hard battle, and many of our men will die. But by nightfall we will have the enemy where we want them.” Alziza said ominously.  

No one seemed mentally capable of refuting the wise ass’s points as he scolded the skeptics like children.  

Everyone agreed to the plan and we readied to strike at sunrise.
  
As sunrise approached I stood with our troop of monks overlooking Dixie. 
 
All of our artillery was lined up. We had renaissance era cannons with cannon balls and primitive exploding shells. The ones that are just bombs with a timed fuse. 
 
We started firing upon Dixie as soon as the sun cracked over the horizon. I was not prepared for the horrors that were about to ensue.  

Minutes after we started firing, squadrons of giant black wasps came flying out of Dixie in giant V’s.  

The wasps were as big as grizzly bears. They had alligator jaws and wendigo heads on the end of their antenna. Some of their legs were replaced with wendigo arms. 
 
The men tried to aim their Gatling guns at them but couldn’t fire high enough. The wasps flew into the groups of men, slaughtering them by the hundreds.  

Then a cavalry charged came out of the city. Hundreds of white knights came out riding gator horses. Gator bears and dogs ran at their side. Dora flew above them, riding one of the wasps.  

“Allow me to introduce you to my latest creations!” She screamed into the megaphone.  
Wendigos then came running out of the city, gaining on, then passing the white knights as they charged towards us.  

I then looked towards the sun, and atop a ridge stood Alziza. He was silhouetted against the sun and stood there like the angel of death, surveying the battlefield. I felt an incredibly strong presence from the spirit world and looked upon Alziza with my third eye.  

In the spirit world Alziza was an alicorn, with wings and a single horn. He led a legion of 200 2 winged angels.  

One of the angels flew over the battlefield and sounded a trumpet. Immediately bullets started curving through the air towards wendigo hearts and klansmen. That battle swung wildly in our favour for a second and then I saw it.  

The red, serpent-like, dragon Saren flying through the spirit world towards Alziza.  
“You think you're as powerful as me, jackass?” Saren laughed.  

Immediately the remaining 199 angels pulled out weapons and all flew at Saren, attacking him. He laughed as he swatted them away like flies. The battle started swinging in favor of the enemy and I fled to a bush to avoid the carnage.  

The wendigos overran the force I deserted and killed them en masse. Their aim was not true and our side took heavy casualties. The klan was pushing us back and there seemed to be little we could do.  

I looked back to the spirit world to see Saren swatting away the last of the 199 angels. 
 
“Now you're mine, jackass!” Saren laughed.  

Alziza’s eyes narrowed and then from all directions, 20 4 winged angels flew in at a tremendous speed. One of them flew over the battlefield with a goblet of wrath and dumped it. The others gathered around Alziza, and then all flew at Saren, attacking him.  

The battle swung in our favor momentarily as bullets curved towards klansmen, gator animals and wendigos. Even a few of the wasps were hit by stray cannon balls. Then everything reversed and our side was being massacred.  

I looked back to the spirit world to see Saren crush the last of the 4 winged angels.  
“Is that all you got, jackass?” Saren laughed.  

I looked to Alziza and saw 7 6 winged angels all clinging to him in the spirit world. They chanted “Glory, glory glory, the lord god the almighty, who was and is and is to come.”  

Then all 7 angels along with Alziza flew at Saren attacking him.  
The battle continued for hours. The upper hand going back and forth constantly. I used guerrilla warfare, getting in shots when I could. I had the pistol and cesarean rifle with me.  

After a while I noticed a wendigo wasp flying straight at me, me cover was blown.  
I only had enough time to dodge or shoot and I chose to roll to the side, as the wasps sword fingers raked the bush.  

I stood up and faced towards in as it came back for another try. I fired at it's left wendigo head, then the right, knocking them both off as it's sword arms raked across the ground closer and closer to me.  

I said a prayer as it approached, not ready to accept death, and terrified of which angel of death would appear to me. I was too young I thought, I still had so much left to do.  

As the wasp's sword arms were about to hit me a stray cannonball stuck it broadside, blowing it too bits. The sword arms exploded from it's body like the quills when you shoot a porcupine and stuck around me. I was pelted with guts.  

I crept back into the overgrowth and wiped myself clean with leaves before returning to the bush.  

Morning turned to afternoon, and then to evening as the battle raged on.  
Bodies of both sides littered the ground, tens of thousands were dead in heaps as the battle raged on.  

I watched the spirit world as the battle raged. Saren took out the 6 winged angels one by one. As sunset approached the last of the 6 winged angels fell. Alziza was wounded and fell to the ground as Saren laughed. 
 
Wendigos sucked men’s blood like mosquitoes, gator bears chomped men in half. Gator dogs yelped with delight as they tore off body parts and swallowed them.  
Wendigo wasps raked groups of troops with their sword arms, killing them all.  

Bullets curved towards northerners and our troops were being slaughtered. I watched helplessly as Saren took control of the battlefield. Bolts of lighting started hitting troops on our side as they lost hope.  

My attention was diverted from the battlefield when out of the corner of my eye I spotted a group of 6 gator dogs running towards me. They either had smelled or heard me because they were coming right at me.  

I knew I couldn't shoot them all in time and I lept from the bush and ran for my life. The dogs chased after me and I could hear them barking. I was terrified knowing that even one of them could tear me limb from limb.  

I ran through the overgrowth trying to lose them as their barks got closer and closer.  

I knew I couldn't outrun them and my mind raced as I tried to come up with some way to save myself. Then I saw a tree that looked just perfect for climbing.  

I scrambled up the tree as the gator dogs lept at my feet. I felt one nick my shoes as I climbed. When I reached the top I looked down at all 6 dogs, who had surrounded the tree.  

They barked at me and I considered shooting them. But instead turned my attention back to the spirit world.  

Alziza cried out to Yahweh, and for a moment I thought his plight fell on deaf ears. Then a number of men came out of the overgrowth, their horses pulling some very advanced looking canons. 
 
In the spirit world I saw 2 dragon heads floating above the men. The black one I didn’t recognize was smouldering uncontrollably. The other, Yahweh was glowing a profound gold light. 
 
“Saren is too powerful! My lord, I have failed!” Alziza cried.  

Yahweh looked at Alziza with amusement. “I don’t like to get my hands dirty in these hell worlds.” Yahweh spoke. “I’ll let Nibiru take it from here”  

The black dragon cackled and then teleported beside Saren, flying at the same speed as him.  

Saren swatted at him, only for him to appear behind him. Nibiru took a bite out of his back and Saren screamed. Nibiru continued teleporting around, taking bites out of Saren as they fought. 
 
All the cesareans had halos. One of them came to the front and screamed, quoting Napolean "God fights with he who has the best artillery!"  

The battlefield took another turn as the Cesareans opened fire with their advanced cannons. The exploding shells swerved towards their targets, hitting the wasps and klansmen. These were not primitive exploding shells and detonated on impact. Wasps fell from the sky, burning, klansmen ran, screaming at the tops of their lungs as they burned.  

Buildings started bursting into flames and Dixie started to burn. The klansmen ran towards the Cesareans, being mowed down by gatling gun fire. I looked towards Dora’s who seemed humiliated that her creations were being killed. 
 
I looked back to the spirit world and saw Saren and Nibiru duking it out. Saren was on the run as Nibiru chomped away.  

Suddenly Nibiru’s head grew a body with legs and he cackled at Saren. Nibiru pointed at Saren and a gridded fabric wrapped around Saren leaving him unable to move.  

“Please don’t kill me!” Saren cried, unable to struggle. 
 
“Oh you know me Saren. I like to play with my food. I won’t kill you now. I’ll play a game with you. I’ll offer you a chance at redemption, and if you don’t take it, I’ll have Julius Caesar damn you, just like Yahweh had Enoch damn the watchers. IT seems right since you plan to reach godhood by eating him, no? Now Sarnen, flee to the ends of the earth. Go to the bottom of the ocean, hide behind the clouds, burying yourself under miles of rock. If you don’t take my offer, there is nowhere I can’t find you Saren. You can’t hide from me.” Nibiru cackled. 
 
The fabric unraveled and Saren flew away at and incredible speed. Dora fled in the physical world, followed by many of her troops.  

Abe Lincoln and the Cesareans seemed focused on a singular task. Burning Dixie to the ground. Cannons fired all night as the city was reduced to total rubble.  
I climbed down the tree since the dogs had gotten bored and left. I saw Max and a group of monks heading after Dora and ran to join them.  

Max had rallied a small force and we tried to follow the Grand wizard Dora. Tons of her underlings gathered on steamboats that sped off down the river. Dora and her squadron of wasps landed on the boats.  

We could not pursue them any farther and they fled with many klansmen, and monsters.  
The next day me and a force of monks went into the rubble to look for survivors. We found 1 building that was miraculously still standing and we went in to investigate.  
There was a family sitting down for breakfast, all dead. 
 
I looked at them and recognized the family as my own. Grandpa Mike sat at the table along with Christie, Jean Robert, Josephine, a man I didn’t recognize, along with Jeff’s wife, another man I didn’t recognize and Jeff's two kids. All of them sat full of bullet holes around an untouched hog on the table. 
 
After Dixie was destroyed what was left of the south surrendered. The grand wizard had fled to who knows where.  

The remaining monks headed back to the monastery and I continued to train under Max for years.  

Unfortunately, shortly after the south surrendered we got news of Abraham Lincoln's assassination at the hands of the KKK. Still, the north had won the war and Abe’s people kept his memory alive, and kept the south in check. 
 
5 years passed and in 1870 we located the Grand Wizard. She had fled to Antarctica.  
We mustered a force of northerners who wanted to avenge Abe as well as all the monks we could and sent a convoy of steam ships to head to Antarctica.  
Me and Max stayed behind as they left.
  
“Why aren’t we going with them?” I asked.
  
Max smiled. “I told you only 7 monk’s in the history of our order have been able to phase through objects, but I have gained the power after that on the chain. The chariot it is called.” 
 
Later that day we got on a steam ship and headed north. Everyone on the ship gathered in the boiler room and prayed as Max activated the chariot.  
  
We sat in the boiler room for numerous hours while the boat chugged along. When we went back to the deck after many hours I couldn’t believe my eyes. We had traveled close to 1000 miles in a single day.  

The next day we did the same thing and within two days we reached our destination, Igloolik.  

“When I was 8 years old I met a green man by the name of Hugo. He inspired me to be the man I am today. I always knew that one day we would meet again.” Max said.  

We found a group of Eskimo’s and Alziza asked something in their language.  

We walked along the ice near Igloolik and found someone frozen in the ice. While we went to boil some water a monk’s dog named Mutt peed on the ice block.  
  
The ice block started to shake, and then shattered as a green man stood there screaming. He had glowing gold eyes; and teeth like the dragons did.  
  
Energy swirled around him as the green man screamed,“I have come for the white witch!” . The ice started cracking around him and for a second I thought we would all be plunged into the freezing water.  
  
He settled down after a moment and he headed back to the monastery one last time before heading to Antarctica.  
  
I record this here so that my contemporaries, as well as future generations, may have a true account of what happened the night they drove old Dixie down
