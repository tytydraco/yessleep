For a long time, I’ve been reliving my own death, day after day. I know it sounds stupid. Who dies more than once? And if I’m already dead, how can I write this down? But please hear my side of the story. Because it’s a pretty tough one.

I had previously led a completely normal life with a normal family. In case you can call my family normal. My parents are workaholics and have provided a stable environment for me and my siblings once I was born. Besides me, there is my older brother Hutch and my little sister Julia. Since Hutch joined the army a year ago and Julia’s puberty phase became apparent when she stayed away from home for hours at a time, it was relatively quiet at home. I myself am a rather unsociable type and like my time alone in the house, which I like to spend watching TV shows or playing PS5.

Then October 15^(th) came. I remember the day I first met my death vividly.

It was a special day because it was the first time Hutch came home to spend a few days with the family. My parents decided to have a picnic on the outskirts of town and then go shopping. I honestly wasn’t in the mood to go out. It was nothing against my brother, I loved him, but I would be seeing him for a few days anyway, so I wanted to stay in the house and just wait until he and my parents came back. Julia was at some party as usual, and I really hoped she wouldn’t call me later and ask if I could pick her up.

My parents left the house around noon. They were a little disappointed that I didn’t want to spend time with Hutch, but the joy of seeing their son again was too great. 

The afternoon was relaxing. I played on my console and finished watching the last episodes of the TV show that I had started last week. When I got bored, I even did my homework and solved the crossword puzzle in the daily newspaper. For lunch I ordered pizza and, since I can never estimate my hunger, I also put fries in the air fryer.

Eventually it was evening and the sky darkened. I heard nothing from my parents or Hutch. No one called. I assumed they were somewhere where there was no signal. They never put their phones on silent because my parents thought that was tactless. I also heard nothing from Julia, which I initially dismissed as a good sign. 

But when the clock struck eleven, I started to get worried. I wrote to my parents, to Hutch, to Julia, called everyone, just to make sure everything was okay. It was extremely rare that I was home alone late at night without a good reason. Or maybe I was just too worried in general. I’ve always been the more withdrawn and anxious type of person.

Eventually I got a message from Hutch. I was so relieved to hear from someone in my family that he was okay. He asked me to pick him and our parents up in my car since they had a flat tire and couldn’t get through to breakdown service. 

I didn’t even bother asking questions. I immediately grabbed my car keys and rushed outside. It was very windy and cold, and I had to fight the oncoming wind several times before I could reach my car.

Suddenly a newspaper hit me square in the face and I ran in different directions in panic. Before I knew it, I was standing on the street and a light shone through the newspaper, getting bigger and bigger. Before I could even take newspaper down, a truck hit me in the middle of my body.

I can still feel the overwhelming pressure very well. It felt so painful, so intense and so real. And how real it was. Or so I thought.

Right after the impact with the truck, I woke up with a start and saw my bedroom. My phone screen showed October 15^(th).

Dreams usually feel real and you only remember them in fragments, but I swear I’ve never had a dream that was so lifelike. I could also remember every detail, as if someone was thinking back to yesterday.

I didn’t think about it any longer and went to the kitchen to have breakfast. My parents and Julia were already sitting at the table. My mother seemed to be in a good mood as I saw her slap a perfectly fried omelette onto my plate.

I asked her why she was in such a good mood and she said: “Your brother is coming back today, remember?”

Hutch? Hadn’t they met him already? No, that all happened in my dream. So they hadn’t met him. Not yet. Was my dream also a vision?

“We’re going to have a nice picnic somewhere in the park and then I thought we’d go to the mall and do some shopping”, my mom continued.

That’s exactly what she had planned in my dream. 

“Without me”, Julia interrupted. “I’m meeting up with Holly and a few friends." 

“By ‘meeting up’, you probably mean some kind of party again”, Mom said sourly.

The whole thing seemed very odd and creepy to me. I had a strange feeling of déjà vu when I got up, but with every second that passed, everything became more and more recognizable.

Just to be really sure that I had hopefully only dreamed all of it, I opened my homework assignment that I had done yesterday or in my dream. The page in the math book that needed to be done was blank. I could still remember writing down the answer to each math problem. What was going on here?

Around noon, my parents left. I didn’t come with them again because I was still too confused and had to make sense of everything.

Instinctively, I wrote to my parents and Julia directly and asked them to keep me updated about their whereabouts and to call me every hour. I tried to sound as serious as possible without explaining too much.

An hour later, the first call came from my parents. I was relieved when they told me that everything was going well, and Hutch had arrived safe and sound. There was no call from Julia, as I had expected.

I spent the afternoon doing my homework, even though I had already done it, and ordering pizza and heating up fries. I already knew how my current TV show ended, even though Netflix showed me the notification that I still had three episodes left.

After another hour, my father called to tell me that the three of them were sitting in a park having their picnic. Julia didn’t call again. 

When the next hour rolled around, there was no call from Julia or my parents. I was sure they had simply forgotten about our agreement, so I texted each of them to call back. No one received my message. 

Later that evening, Hutch called me and asked me to pick him and Mom and Dad up because of a flat tire.

As I had done before, I grabbed my keys and ran outside. Only then did I realize the danger that had cost me my life the other time. It was very windy and cold, but I fought my way through the wind with small steps.

Suddenly a newspaper came flying and smacked me in the face. I immediately stopped and ripped it off me. Not this time, I thought to myself.

I finally got to my car and drove off. On the way there I grabbed my phone and texted Hutch to tell me where they were. I was apparently way too excited because I wasn’t paying much attention to the road.

That ended up being my fate because before I knew it I crashed straight into a tree and flew forward.

I remember feeling like my head had been pierced. The feeling was insanely awful. But it didn’t last long, as I found myself safe and sound in my bedroom. My phone screen showed October 15^(th).

I hadn’t dreamed. I hadn’t had any visions. I was caught in a time loop that always ended in my death.

I really didn’t know what to make of it and what caused it happen. I was panicking at the thought of having to live the same day for the rest of my life. 

This went on for a while. I don’t know if I just wanted to keep testing the time loop or if I was just getting depressed, but I decided to take advantage of that time and altered my daily routine every day. One day I blew all my money gambling. Other days I hooked up with Tinder dates or just trashed the house. Every day was different, as was the way I died. I either had a heart attack, fell down the stairs and broke my neck or I deliberately unalived me by jumping out of the window. With each day I changed drastically and with each day I mourned my old self. 

Finally, the 24^(th) repetition of October 15^(th) arrived. I slithered out of bed and staggered into the kitchen. My parents commented on my odd behavior and I waved it off as usual and let the day come. 

“Are you excited about seeing your brother?” Mom asked me.

“Sure, I can’t wait for him to walk in the door”, I replied sarcastically, shoveling omelette into my mouth.

“What? You don’t want to come with us? It’s your brother.” 

“I’m going to see him for a few more days anyway, so who cares?”

“Don’t be so disrespectful. Don’t take everything for granted. What if your brother can’t make it today? Wouldn’t you be sad about that?”

I stopped eating. I became alert to what my mom had just said.

I toyed with the idea that maybe the way out of the time loop depended on my choices. Maybe I just needed to see my brother again to continue the events.

Since I had nothing to lose anyway, I changed my original plan to do a Harry Potter marathon and agreed to come and pick up Hutch.

We left the house around noon and drove to the airport where we were waiting for Hutch. He appeared in his combat uniform and seemed relieved to see us. But he also seemed tired, which I could understand given the fact that he had spent months in the Middle East witnessing the horrors of humanity first hand and had to sit and wait for hours for the enemies to come. 

I hugged Hutch and welcomed him. For the first time since the time loop began, I was overwhelmed with joy. Was this the key to getting out of here?

Everything was going well so far. We drove to the edge of town and had the picnic that my mom wanted to do.

After we sat on a blanket with sandwiches and iced tea and did some chitchatting, my dad eventually steered the conversation to the conditions in Afghanistan, where Hutch was stationed.

“How are you coping, son?”

“It’s terrible, Dad. Day after day I sit there, staring through the sight of the rifle, waiting for it to happen.”

My mom and I looked up.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I’m waiting for death. This routine repeats itself every day, nothing changes. We all just sit there and and wait for it to be over. Sometimes I even hope that we’re ambushed and it’s all over for good.”

My mom started to whimper. I was also worried about Hutch’s behavior. He didn’t sound like himself. The war had changed him too much.

“Please don’t say that”, my mom said gently. 

Hutch suddenly got angry and stood up.

“So I shouldn’t tell the truth, Mom? I’m sorry my time in Kabul isn’t like summer camp!” 

Suddenly he pulled a gun out from behind and pointed it at the three of us. I couldn’t believe it.

It took me a few seconds to put two and two together. Finally, it dawned on me. The reason my parents hadn’t contacted me the whole time during the time loop was because Hutch had shot them. They never made it home because they were already dead.

I instinctively stood in front of my parents, who were so shocked that they couldn’t assess the situation.

As I slowly moved toward him, with the intention of taking the gun away from him, I spoke to him gently. “You don’t want that, Hutch. Look at yourself. The last months have changed you completely.”

“You have no idea what I’ve been through!” he screamed desperately.

“You’re right, I don’t know what you’ve had to go through. But I know the feeling of waiting every day for something to change. Until you’re out of this nightmare.” 

Hutch didn’t say anything. He actually seemed to soften up. He lowered his gun slightly and became withdrawn.

I took the opportunity and made another step forward to take the gun from his hand. He didn’t fight back. Instead, he burst into tears. I hugged him tightly and just let him collapse. My parents came over and joined in the hug.

After a while, we drove straight to a therapy center and left Hutch under the care of nursing staff for the next few days. Then my parents and I drove home. Our car never broke down on the way home either.

It was already dark when we got home. I couldn’t believe it. I had broken out of the time loop and could finally get on with my life.

But when we reached our driveway, something was strange. A police car was parked in front of our door and two police officers were standing next to it, apparently waiting for us.

This is how I found out that during our stay with Hutch, my sister Julia had been in a car accident with some friends. The driver, her best friend Holly, had driven drunk and hit a lamppost. All the passengers were dead on impact.

While the officers were informing us, I suddenly realized that I hadn’t checked my phone the entire time. My phone screen showed October 16^(th). And three missing calls from Julia.
