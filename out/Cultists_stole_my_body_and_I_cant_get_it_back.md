night after night, i kept having nightmares, all of the same thing. in these dreams i keep seeing these people in my yard, they always gather  around in a circle or something, and i keep hearing something about a curse. in a lot of them from a low ground angle i see them gathering around an unconscious, or maybe even dead body, before it being swallowed by the earth.  
one night i woke up in a cold sweat after one of these dreams. i felt sick and unsteady. i crept down the stairs and looked out the window, where i saw a glow at the edge of my yard. i stepped outside, barefoot and started walking over. the whole time extremely nervous.  
i see the figures that were in my dreams. they were gathering around in a circle. it seemed like they were getting ready for some kind of ritual.  
 my heart was racing and i kept repeating to myself "holy shit holy shit what the hell" I took out my phone to start recording. they snapped their heads to me all in unison. i started getting pulled towards them. it felt like my head was being ripped out of my body. it's the last thing i remember before i was unconscious and it felt like i was being ripped and torn from myself.  
   
 i wake up thinking it was another dream.  
 something was very wrong.  
   
 i see myself sleeping.  
 i try to go up to myself but i feel small, i can't feel my legs, i have no arms. I fall off the bed and slowly crawl over to the mirror in the corner of my room, and in it, i see something someone would never expect. in it, i see a snake. "was this the "curse" i kept seeing in my dreams?" i thought. at this point i was really tired and confused, on the verge crying from confusion. i go back up to my bed and see myself. i try to climb up but fail. after a few attempts i finally manage to slide up. i try pushing my body over, but it doesn't wake up. why would it? i snap back to reality, clearing the haze and see myself, on the ground. and me, for some reason now a snake. i can't do anything; the figures, that looked like some sort of cult, used literal black magic on me, and took me from my own body. i thought this had to have been a dream, but no. i was fully aware, could feel pain, i could think. but the only thing was that it felt like reality was breaking before my eyes. some sort of horrible magic is real, and got me trapped in the body of a danger noodle, and i just had to ask myself: why.  
 i slither out of my room and almost fall down the stairs. i stop.  
 i hear a knock on the door. it's the middle of the night and i hear a knock on the door. i hide under a dresser.  
 after some time waiting. the door busts open. the people seem to be searching my house as i hear their boots clack against the floor. one goes upstairs. i hear the muffled sound of them go into my room.  
 i know whats happening.  
   
 i hear the sound of clothes being dragged across the floor. i peep out and see the person, dragging me down the stairs. they all carry my body and start to head out the door. i try to go after them as fast as i can, but i can barely go that fast because i can't run. they start moving to the corner of the yard where i first found them. i try to follow but can only keep up for so long, trying to get closer feels useless, i try to bite closer but there's no stopping it. the soreness feels like hell but i keep going and i don't know why. they're there.  
 i witness the nightmares before not my very eyes.  
 i see it at a low angle. i now know that it's my body they have taken.  
 they are chanting around me, until the earth takes myself beneath it.  
 they all scamper away into the woods. but i, am still there.   
   
 i'm left with a hollow feeling.  
   
 all these nightmares weren't just nightmares, they were warnings. and with the knowledge that i will never walk or run again. i rest there in the silence that is this curse. 

these people sacrifice bodies to something, and the beforehand step to doing that, is putting the people in something else. I don't know how many people they did this to, i don't know if it's about ethicality, or if it's about making it easier, or even so about covering it up. or even just the slight chance that this is all a dream.  


 i get closer and find where i dropped my phone. It's  bent down the middle, unsalvageable.   
 i go back to my house and just don't know what to do. i just roll around and silently mope, until i fall asleep. the next day i turn on my computer and painstakingly start typing letter after letter very slowly. it took days to write but here it is. nobody would ever have believed me.  
   
 about a week after it happened, i see missing signs of myself. whenever i see them i get the hollow feeling again. i don't have many resources left but it's enough to keep going.
