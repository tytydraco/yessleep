I got on the other me’s bus.

I’m not gonna claim I was in the right headspace, or that I had particularly bright ideas. But I can tell you that my chest was cold and tight, even though my heart was beatin’ fuller and stronger than it had in longer than I could remember.

I walked out of that hospital, I found they’d already gone and buried her, the others, without calling me up. That miffed me a bit. But I thought about it. I thought about that thing descending from the shining stars and the black void up yonder, and how it wanted to take things so badly. Things that it had no right to take. And I pictured something scuttling off with her body. Dead don’t have to be respected, except by your own manners.

It was still up there, somewhere. I wonder what it does to get hold of you. At what point do you give enough of yourself over that it can just do what it does? Or is it immune to rules? Maybe it’s…

They told me they - the rabbits, that is - always came back for checkups and other things. Nothing more, nothing less. Doctors are as liptight about gossip as they’ve always been. Though I don’t remember when they all started to look like the same handful of people, with slight variations. Some of them had a badge with that jumble of words on it - *ECFK* \- and they looked a lot more individual-like.

I asked em’, the nurses that is, if they’d be able to take care of the ones left behind still. They said hopefully. I think that’s why I decided to do what I did. I’m tired of hopefully, of maybe, of they *could* be okay.

I make a bet. I leave my bus out front, ask the receptionist if someone can watch it for me. They tell me sure, and I take a good, long look at it. White and blue, a wolf painted over the leaping silver cat. A little longer, a little wider and taller than most, just a tad faster. Ramp, the roll-down windows. Hatch inside that most other buses, I’m sure as certain, probably don’t have.

Long, long years. Long, long roads that most folk who’re like me genuine instead of pretending can’t quite make out. They wander, and try to help, and don’t matter if they bring shining armor and big guns or a good heart. They get lost, and something snatches em’ up. So they stay in the walls, huh? And leave the between things to other folk. Lot of like-mes out here, both sorts. I’ve driven many of both before.

At some point, it got so hard to tell. And when you drive enough folks about, you stop caring. Everyone’s the same, till they stop being uncivil. And you make up rules, your own special ones, that don’t matter quite much. But it’s the thought that counts. That’s just the way the world works.

I’m rambling. Are you listenin’? Do you know what’ll happen if you forget, too?

I bring my laptop. The rifle. My bag. All I really needed, wanted, at the moment. The things down under stopped meaning much. I guess in a way they never quite did. It was the thought that counted, like I said. And I’d stopped having such good thoughts for the moment.

I wait. Sitting on a bench low enough for me next to ones for stranger shapes and longer, shorter legs. The post is right there, in front of that hospital. Has all the usual postings on it. My bus and Copyhat’s both have the red circle today. Someone sits down next to me, someone I don’t quite look at. But I think they look at me. I think they must’ve ridden with me before, and if I looked I’d remember em’.

I heard them breathing hard, awkward. I don’t think they liked seeing me waiting. I think, even for folk as strange as the ones out here, when routine breaks so blatantly with the things you think are safe, you get real concerned. Was it for me, or for the sense of order I bring?

He don’t make me wait long. Maybe fifteen minutes. I figure maybe he’s got some of the senses I do, twisted as they are by now. His bus pulls up, and I know it’s not mine because it wears the weather of years on the outside, not the inside. Broken windows, patches of rust that don’t make sense with how random they’re placed. They’ve tried to clean it up, looks like, but all it did is make it shine too bright and let the eye notice the dimmer bits all the more.

He tried to paint a wolf over the side. But it’s lopsided, ugly, and sad. I think it might be truer to the real thing than mine, though. And I don’t mean to speak ill of anyone in particular. You just. Every person has an honest version of themselves, beneath the hat-tipping, smiles, and pretenses.

I get on. I put some money into his box. He’s got the same count as me, same cardboard. But when he looks at me I see myself, if my eyes were sunken and sad and all my weathered lines and wrinkles were more pronounced. I look mighty confused, one of my glasses’ lenses cracked. I don’t look like a monster. Not quite. But I’m hunched and broken, and they tip their hat too far down, smile too wobbly.

“How do you please to do?” I swear they degraded in a different way every time I saw them, a slow decline that loops and changes a little every sighting. Ever since they went into the Unknown and didn’t come back quite the same.

“I’m fine.” I had a thought. Rolled it around in my head. “Go where you want to be goin’. And don’t pick anyone else up till I’m off. You hear?”

They stared at me a while. Were they thinking things like *danger*, *unreasonable*, *what’s that even mean?* But they were a people pleaser, must be, since they just muttered an okay. Waited till I sat down, put things into gear and started going.

I looked at the back. Saw a hatch.

I watched the landscape as it went by. He ducked and weaved off of the roads plain and not-quite-so, in and out, without much rhyme or reason. He was jittery, paranoid, would do slight swerves or even stop outright for as long as minutes at a time. Like he expected the world to come crashing down around him whenever it so pleased. But he kept going. He stopped sometimes, at the posts. I saw folk debating getting on. Referencing the signage and white papers with all their pictures and symbols and words.

They seemed to make sense to some more than others. And I saw at least two look at *me*, specifically, and one relaxed and the other tensed. World out of order.

Someone tried to get on. Tapped the door. I noticed then he had scribbled slips taped all over the inside, with polite mangled phrases. *On you get to good well*, *no thieves loved just you*, practically illegible garbage versions of the sentences I and so many others used as charms. I suppose it was for the best. You don’t want polite eyes your way when you don’t know quite what it means.

After that knock he stopped trying to let people on. Well, rather, he stopped freezing up and wondering what he was supposed to do. How to walk the fine lines, where my words meshed with his wants and others.

I was waiting to see if he’d try to make convo. To see where he’d stop, if anywhere. Maybe he’d just keep driving forever and I’d starve to death on the bus. Not that it was an actual danger, mind. I’d given him something. If I got off I’d be voiding a transaction, or at worst putting him in trouble stead’ of me.

Sides’, I’d said “go where you want to be goin”, never said nothing about when or where to stop or that where I ended up mattered, and I’d plainly put a “when I’m off” statement at the end. Funny thing, words. Intent and the dotted lines both matter. And if you’re not careful, you can back yourself into a corner you can never find your way out of.

My mind went all the way back to the day I’d seen him drive through that blizzard, poor old Copyhat. What mattered so much beyond that white light that the woman with the umbrella let herself get tangled in obligations and words? And who in the hell decided there were things out there that get to break the rules as much as they so damn please?

Have I ever really told you much vivid about the world passing me by as I drove? Probably not. It was normal to me. So I painted a picture with my words, like I’d been told, till something got fuzzy in a way I didn’t quite like.

I’ll give it another go, right here and now. We passed by open grasslands that broke off into suburbia, streets and buildings from a dozen different countries that no longer had names for public lips. Rivers and lakes that stopped, came in, and ended where it didn’t make a lick of sense, water too bright or too dark. They’d tried to fit in architecture where it could only make sense in theory. Playgrounds, hallways, just sitting on or running through hills where nobody would ever think to have a need for em’.

If you paid attention to some of the watery places, you might see those old waterpark tubes or white tiles sprinkled in. Signage for beaches and pools. There were buildings built where roadstops should be, and some of them made sense, other times you’d see an office section or an elevator that might go in one sitting all exposed out in the open. Deserts got especially weird, holes black as tar that went who knows where, half-glass handfuls of dunes.

Strangers in strange lands try their best, I think. The ones who want to make a home somewhere new instead of just slink into someone else’s. People with bad intents more often than not just want in to cause harm, they don’t care about having something of their own or fitting in a space they think is decent. They just want you to not quite pay enough attention to em’ till they’ve got a knife in your back.

“Do you. Deer. Do you feed the deer?” I heard Copyhat’s voice in front of me. I pulled back from my thoughts, fixed on him. We went into woodland. I heard hooves in the distance, gently plodding. Keeping up better than they might’ve been able to if they were regular sorts.

“I have, a couple times. Why?” I asked. I clenched and unclenched my hands. Less fight or flight over the situation, more the impending conversation.

“I want to feed the deer. Everyone needs to eat. We have to have diners. We have to have jobs. We have to have people willing to take us to places we can eat and have jobs.” His eyes glazed over, and he drove so straight and plain he almost missed a curve and took us right into a tree as the road bent sharply.

“That’s what we’re for, huh? In your mind.”

“You need money to buy food to feed the deer. To have gas to drive buses. To get things for. For friends.” He called me by my full, actual name then. I startled a bit at that. Then his voice changed. “Hey, Jxxx. Was I ever a good friend?”

I remembered something. Something that put me on edge and made my guts twist with guilt and remembering. The deer moved a bit slower. The bus slowed the same. The world got quieter, like the whole of it was taking careful steps. It got quiet enough that I panicked, almost. I did not want them to come. I forget them, in particular, for a reason. And they only came when it was quiet, so low you could only make out learned sounds.

I saw the birds leave for safer pastures. But I still heard their song, just slightly. A bit of static overlaid it briefly, then it went away as something righted its manner of speaking. Sometimes they were quiet, completely, sometimes they weren’t.

“I think you were. I think you could’ve been.” I saw a younger fellow there, then, in the driver seat. And he was real scared.

*I think I’ve made a mistake, Jxxx. I don’t think we’re… Shit. I need to get them. Someone has to pick them up. If I don’t come back…* The words of someone that weren’t there anymore whispered in my mind. Shaking voice. Nobody would lift a finger. Not if they had to go where they weren’t meant to, if they didn’t know if they’d come back.

Cowards.

“That diner. Where they treated me so… Kind. And I saw him and you sitting there. He took me wherever I wanted to go. If I hadn’t… We weren’t supposed to go…” I saw them mimic one of my gestures, hand gripping the wheel so hard I heard a crack of whitening knuckles.

“I know. Everyone wants to be where they want to, not where they’re meant meant to, huh?” And there’s all sorts of ways you can take that.

“I tried. For a very long time, I tried. And I wanted to show you. I wanted you to know I could, too. When he came back. When you came back. But things changed. And I had to learn again. It needed to be perfect. So I wouldn’t make any mistakes. But everything kept. *Changing*.” I saw someone else, someone I’d forgotten, from way back before the world stopped making sense the first time. Not everyone fits in, even when the world changes again to be like somewhere you’d think they’d thrive.

They went away, too. It was me again. “I don’t think he’s coming back, Jxxx. I think Jxx is dead. It’s so easy to say his name, now. Like I know if someone hears it, if I throw every letter in for kicks, it won’t matter a lick.”

They stopped. Went off-road, first, careful as you please. Then they stopped in a clearing with a patch of dark water in front of it, shining with a light that didn’t belong somewhere so black. Someone had put up little drawings all around, hanging from the trees, most of them faded and old. I saw a little fellow in a yellow raincoat with a light for a head holding the hand of something that was only like him a little.

That one was fresher. It had a bubble next to it with words in it. *“I have a voice.”*

I don’t think it’d ever gotten to say those words.

Crows flocked around us, standing hesitantly on little black feet in the trees. They watched. Waited. Something about them seemed expectant, at first, then forlorn. I don’t know how or why I got that particular feeling. I’ve been here before. I remember it clear as day now. I just didn’t get to know them well enough.

The deer started to come around, too. Long necks, fat heads, everything about them stretched too far. But they didn’t look so strange to me anymore. They peered around all curious, clopped forward. A wall of black eyes and twisting shapes surrounded us on all sides. I heard them breathing.

“We’re here.” The me that wasn’t me said.

He went into his own little hatch. Came up with a box. I helped him carry it out. Then I sat with him, and I watched the lake. It was still here. If I parsed my memory, the things around it were different. The tunnel was new. I could feel the roads around me, and where they went didn’t quite match up. I think the tunnel goes somewhere regular and fair. Or somewhere where, even now, you aren’t meant to dread. Even when all boundaries are broken, it is not for you or me.

I don’t know who it’s for. But I wondered who the other tunnels belonged to now. Those black, creeping shadows alone?

He fed the deer. And he gave them curious bits and bobs. He’d only traded for practical things. Things to trade for later, to get less practical bits that didn’t quite matter as much to him as they did these strange things. Funny how value works. I guess currency matters most when it doesn’t, but what you can buy with it does.

He told me about photos. About things he’d taken pictures of for longer than I should’ve been alive. Between three eras. Of friends, of secret places he wasn’t meant to see, of routines and things that could make everything else make sense if only they paid enough attention and pondered long enough. Pictures don’t matter much. Images aren’t voices, and I can’t tell you why. But you still need eyes to see what you’re drawing, or snapping clicks at. And not everything wants to be seen, and not everything cares about wants so much as vague notions of privacy.

Someone creeped up on us. I listened as quiet settled, heard something made of timber hunker down. I think it could’ve taken me, if it’d wanted to. I don’t know why it didn’t.

Copyhat became someone else, and they asked me questions they weren’t meant to. Spoke the names of people it wasn’t meant to know. Let loose secrets not meant to be loose. I think he got a mad little idea in his head. I don’t think it’d seen my old trainee, the first one, with not a bit of light left in his eyes. I don’t think it’d seen me go through that tunnel, a sour feeling in my gut and a damn strong need to find out what was what and see if I could fix things.

Memory is a funny thing. You get old, or you get hurt, and you try to forget a lot of things, or can’t help but do it. And you often don’t remember until it’s too late. Until someone has said something to jog your brain into position, but it doesn’t matter anymore.

The world got stiller than it had any right to get. I heard the sounds of normal things. Bells, familiar songs you’d hear played over the radio. Someone moving a box. A carton of milk being jostled. The whoosh of a bus door closing, the sound of wheels crunching on gravel. Quiet forests, traffic. Mail shuffling into place.

I heard a gunshot ring out. When the world stops wanting you, it doesn’t care what happens to you anymore. The world is a cruel place. So sometimes it only allows mercy when it shouldn’t have been needed in the first place.

A staticy voice rang out somewhere behind me. “Humane kill. Trophy.” It sounded strangled.

But it didn’t take the body. The normal sounds of the world retreated. The deer came closer now. Their expressions changed in a way I couldn’t quite place, their breathing became a struggle. They bent their long necks down, licked the forehead of the fallen where the blood was welling.

I don’t think they were animals. Not quite. I think they were just curious. I think that, when I counted, a handful were missing who weren’t supposed to be. And I don’t think they’d been shot.

I went into their hatch. Privacy is dead when the person keeping secrets is. They didn’t have paper slips strung up. In a way, I was blessed to have the chance in the first place, even if sometimes the people I was hoping would guide me along were quieter than I needed them to be. Someone was out there for me, at least.

All they had was photos. Hundreds of them, of people they never knew, or who didn’t want to know them. Of old diners back when they made sense, taken from dark places in black and white. They got color as time went on. They traced a path through history. But once they got color, they stopped featuring certain people who smiled when they saw them. The old office building they wandered into only started being seen from the outside.

Grainy, at first. Then fully developed. And the world kept pattering on, one they didn’t belong to. One they could try to help, but could never understand. They had their role models, but maybe they’d been afraid of trying to be like them, of not quite holding up to snuff.

Some of them I just knew not to look at. I think at least a few showed me what was beyond that bright light that was always at the end of the road no matter where you turned.

The world I knew was gone. I’d stepped out of it into one I didn't quite belong to. And I kept doing my job anyway. Time was a blur after that. I guess part of it was the roads I traveled, the other half was me not knowing where I’d been before it all went to jigsaw madness.

I think I tossed my license away, rather than losing it. I guess they remembered me cause I’d done good all those years. But I couldn’t stand the color. It was too bright.

I’m going to hitch a ride back to my bus. Someone’ll take Copyhat’s after it’s left long enough, I’m sure. Who knows where it’ll end up. I’m thinking, probably, in pieces, sent back to Society where it should’ve been in the first place.

I’ve got to drive the bus, one last time. I think a lot of people will be upset with me. But I know where I need to go, and where I want [to](https://www.reddit.com/user/PattableGreeb/comments/1hspca3/outside_of_society_belong_or_be_forgotten_master/) [go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hrc2sa/i_drive_a_bus_along_special_roads_i_dont_remember/)
