Well, that's the name that I've given her anyway. I've told no one about this and don't intend on telling anyone in person, this is as far as I'm willing to go and then maybe with a lot of luck, I can put this haunting visage of terror in the back of my mind forever.

Every few days or so I go on a midnight drive to ease the mind and sooth the body. The stereo humming quietly the songs of some pop star's messy love life, just turned up enough to tickle my ears, and the chilled breeze strolling into my face through the cracked windows of my humble little vehicle. It really helps calm the worries of the bleakest parts of our everyday realities. I'd really recommend it.

I was enjoying such a ride like I do for the fourth time that week - I had a lot on my mind that week - and when I was about halfway through my 20 minute midnight drive, my headlights picked up a twinkle of pale movement in the distance. I slowed my car, but made sure to leave it turned on just in case. Squinting my eyes at the shifting, grey mass in the distance, I discovered it was a naked person, bloody and ghostly white.

Without so much as a second thought I bolted up out of my seat and sprinted headlong in the direction of the distressed figure in front of me. Yet despite my burning need to help this stranger that clearly needed it at a first glance, my sprint slowed to a jog which soon came to an idle stand.

I was maybe 5 meters from her at this point. I knew it was a woman, her sobs were high pitched and ever so fragile. They carried the most profound sense of dispair that I've never been able to describe in my head or even been able to fully comprehend.

Her sickly body was towering, maybe over 2 meters tall while hunched forward. The vulnerability in her aimless ambling from a distance made her look so much smaller. The poor thing's frame was wobbly and quaked with every heaving sob that escaped her.

I took in the horribly depressing sight of this giant of a lady from head to toe. A messy mop of tangled, blond hair spun ropes along her back, and the grease slicked vines clung to her skin and wove into each other, creating a kind of frizzy halo around the diameter of her head.

Her torso was pear shaped and lumpy. She didn't look obese, more like a painfully thin, overloaded flesh bag that threatened to split under every convulsing bulge that grew, shrank and reappeared all over her lower back, and they were massive, about the size of watermelons.

In spite of the torso's large shape, her spine was still visible through her tight, leathery skin that clung viciously to her skeleton. Thick, inky veins snaked along her bruised and diseased looking skin, like cracks in marble and they throbbed with viscous blood. Her shoulder blades were jagged and pointy, they almost threatened to break through the tired layers of flesh.

In contrast, her arms hung akimbo to her body, spindly and boney. I almost thought her arms were pure, pristine bone they were so thin and white. Talon - like fingers curled into half fists and twitched with every jerk of her agonized body.

Her legs were slightly more plump than her arms, but not by much. Her knees buckled and cracked like an engorged penguin under her immense weight that was pulsing and shifting in her belly. The inside of her thighs were bloody; fresh, slimey and near neon crimson slathered on crusted, oily, sooty brown stains of past pains. 

I realised then that I was holding my breath. I sucked in a breath of air that stung my throat and nostrils, so much so that I had to cover my face and hold in the stomach churning wretch from escaping my mouth. I could smell burned pennies and tasted sour afterbirth coating my tongue. I couldn't hold it in and I vomited with such force it nearly brought me to my knees.

This prompted her to turn in my direction. I only saw her feet at first, shifting and balancing her weight with wet slaps of calloused skin on the tarmac. As my eyes traveled skyward her undulating belly began to gyrate and spasm in random intervals, as if several masses were aware of my treacherous observing and wanted to burst from their host to stop me. Pitch black stretch marks dashed along her bloated abdomen like slashes in the very fabric of space. She was like a human termite queen.

My eyes raced up to her face. The eyes were near invisible, hiding under the tangled dreads of oily hair and they were so sunken into their sockets it almost seemed to me that she jad no eyes at all. But I could spot a pair of jaundiced eyes that glistened and radiated the most genuine agony and terror deep within those withering pits of saggy, purple flesh.

Besides the skin around her eyes that sagged and inflated under her eye pits, her paper like hide wrapped around her skull so tightly that her jaw chattered and her mouth was locked into a permanent snarl from which her anguished cries became swine - like snorts and wheezing gargles which ejected thin jets of venomously yellow spittle from between her equally yellow teeth.

Her nose was all but absent, leaving a fleshy, mucus caked bat snout that gaped in the middle of her ghastly visage. Stray strands of golden hair dragged themselves along her tear soaked cheeks, hanged in front of her quivering lips. and the swaying ribbonsoves stiffly with every laboured huff that carried her evident anguish. 

We locked eyes for a moment, before she let out the most shrill, throat shredding cry that rumbled like thingernin my eardrums. I held my ears and lost my footing from the stun of her booming scream which sent me down on my ass. Blood shot and spat from between her tremorimg legs and the crowd in her belly were more vigorous than they'd ever been. Her pelvis crunched, snaped and unhinged like a snake's jaw to release the spawn in her rotten guts.

Something fell out...

It splashed to the ground with a wet plap and was so sticky and slimey that it stuck firmly where it landed. It wasn't clear what it was at first, but the shiney gums and oily tongues that poked curiously out of the many toothless mouthes of the beehive shaped mound that stuck to the tarmac then began to cry with many voices simultaneously.

It was a cluster of baby heads.

I shot up spinning 180° and ran as fast as my adrenaline pumped legs would carry me to my car. The baby-cluster screamed after me with childlike whails and the aphid mother followed shortly after them. The cries were so alive, so anguished, so reality splitting that I began to cry as I ran. I got in my car with haste, I couldn't even close the door or put on my seatbelt. I slammed down the acceleration, fully intending to crush the beast and it's heir beneath my tires.

I tried to see out of my windscreen but my eyes were so flooded with tears that i could only see blurred and hazed shapes and colours. I braced for the impact of the collision but it never came. I wiped my eyes until the carriageway became clear again and I sped home, not daring to slow down until I could hunker down in my own fortress.

It's been months since then and it's all I think about. I think about it at work, when I'm with family, when I'm with my friends or my lover, when I do literally anything! (If) I fall asleep after I've pushed that haunting image out of my mind for a fleeting moment, I dream about it. It's consuming every koment of my life and I'm too scared to tell anyone. In person, anyway...

Hence why I'm typing this. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get some sort of closure from my telling, but I'm not holding my breath. Maybe one day I'll cave in and tell everyone why I've been so hollow and fucked up recently. Everyone asks about it and I can never find the words to explain. Even now, I can't grasp the pain that felt that woman's lips when I found her that night...

And I know I never will.
