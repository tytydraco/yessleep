I keep seeing her in the corners of my eyes, even when she’s not in the room. At first, I thought it was stress, lack of sleep… but it’s not. Something about her follows me. Lingers. Watches. And now, I can’t tell where she ends and I begin.

I know I’m breaking every confidentiality rule in the book, but I don’t care anymore. I can’t handle this alone. I think I’m treating a succubus. And she’s slowly draining me.

Her name is Clara T.S. At first, she seemed perfect. Too perfect. Black hair, green-hazel eyes, brown skin, a smile that could hypnotize anyone. Calm, elegant, composed. But now? I swear she isn’t human. Every session leaves me drained. Sometimes I can’t remember the last ten or twenty minutes. My notes are all I have to piece together what the hell just happened.

Session 1 – 09/08/2025  
She sits there for fifty minutes. Doesn’t say a word. Just smiles. Later, I noticed a faint reddish-purple lipstick mark at the bottom of my notes. I didn’t even remember seeing it at the time.

Session 2 – 12/08/2025  
She finally speaks. Nightmares. Harming people. Devouring them. Insomnia so bad she hasn’t slept in days. No fatigue though—like she’s powered by something else. Calm. Creepy calm. Eyes never leave mine. Low, soft voice, lightly playful. I felt uneasy but shrugged it off.

Session 3 – 15/08/2025  
She shows me scratches and bruises on her hands, neck, back, legs. Handprints. She mentions her partners getting sick after encounters. My stomach twisted. Later, a faint lipstick mark appeared on my cheek. My skin crawled.

Session 4 – 18/08/2025  
Late-night session. She tells me about a dream where someone violently assaults her… eats her. Calm. Almost seductively happy. Then, I can’t forget this:

“I felt her hand. Sliding over my thigh. Soft, almost tender at first. For a heartbeat, I wanted to believe it was human. Then the chill hit. Ice. Sharp, creeping under my skin. Her nails dragged upward slowly, deliberate, leaving a sting that burned long after she pulled away. It should’ve been intimate. But it wasn’t. It was predatory. Completely predatory.”

That night, I fell asleep drained. I dreamed I woke up in my bed. Clara T.S. was there. I felt her hands on me. I couldn’t move. Then I woke up… again. Same room. Same paralyzing presence. My mind shattered trying to separate the layers. Every time I woke, I wasn’t sure if it was real or another dream. The scratches on my skin were real. Ice burned under my veins.

Session 5 – 28/08/2025  
She smiles at me. I ask about her nightmares. She describes men attacking her, leaving bruises… and I feel it too. Scratches, burns, weakness—same exact symptoms. I can’t stop crying. I’ve lost control of myself.

She steps closer. Hands on my chest, on my face. I am not me anymore. My thoughts aren’t mine. I feel her inside my head. I fall asleep in her arms.

3:37 AM

This time, the dream layers collapse. I wake. She’s above me. Naked. Hair gone. Skin pale as chalk. Blood dripping from her mouth. Two red horns erupting from her head. Eyes deep, unnatural purple. She tilted her head slightly and let out a low, throaty laugh—soft, feminine, cruel.

I jolted awake. Sweat, shaking. Every nerve screaming. Then I realized… I wasn’t awake. Another layer. Her shadow detached, sliding across the floor, slow, silent… watching me. I couldn’t move. Legs wouldn’t respond. It lingered closer, almost breathing, almost alive… then merged back with her. She wasn’t just in the room. She was everywhere.

I tried leaving. Canceled appointments. Fled to another country. I stayed there for a long holiday, tried to relax, and regain some normalcy. But the scratches? The bruises? Fucking real.

11/09/2025 – 20:00  
I walked into my office. The air thickened. She was there. Clara T.S. Radiant. Too radiant. My vision blurred; the lights dimmed unnaturally.

“Doctor… do you feel it too?” she whispered, silk coiling around my chest.

I couldn’t speak. Pen fell. My thoughts weren’t mine. She’s rewriting me. Eyes purple. Skin chalk white. Limbs heavy. Heart slowing.

I’m writing this now… but it doesn’t feel like me. She’s inside me.

The last thing I remember: her tongue brushing my face, body sinking into mine, and a voice in my head:

“You thought you were helping me… Look at you, you poor little thing… It’s okay now. I will help myself. GO. TO. SLEEP.”
