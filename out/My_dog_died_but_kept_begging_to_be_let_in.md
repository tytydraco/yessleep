It's my fault he died, honestly. I'm 16 and I was supposed to be watching him outside. We live out in the countryside, some southern county no one cares about in the middle of bum fuck nowhere, and Rudy is always allowed to go out without a leash because he's trained to not go too far and come right back after doing his busines. He's a chocolate lab with a red collar and the biggest, sweetest wet eyes you've ever seen. He was, at least. 

I let Rudy out after putting in a pizza, home alone since my parents were at work. As he played around our large property, I sat on the porch and watched videos on my phone. Suddenly, I jumped up, having forgotten about my food, and ran back inside. I'd burnt an entire frozen pepperoni pizza, and I was cussing up a storm, taking it out the oven and trying to figure out what I was gonna tell my parents so I wouldn't be scolded for wasting food. I forgot about my dog for a while and rummaged through the fridge for something else to eat as the sun went down. That's when I heard the most God awful sound. 

Tires screeching on the road at the end of the driveway, a vehicle grinding to a sudden halt just as the loud pained yelp of our family's best friend rang out in the humid, evening air. 

I ran out the house, across the lawn, down the drive, and fell to my knees where Rudy was lying on the road with his chest and stomach caved in. The car was gone, speeding down the road, leaving tire tracks and gore over poor Rudy's crushed abdomen. I cried harder than I've ever cried in my entire life as I watched him squirm and whine in agony before finally the light faded from his big brown eyes. 

Rudy had gone up the drive for no real reason. He usually stuck to the woods around our house, digging up holes or peeing in bushes. He never had interest in exploring the road, and he never once tried. If I had told him to come in already, he would be alive to this day. 

My parents mourned deeply, and I had the sense they were blaming me as well. A week passed and we tried to move on, but then one evening I went outside to walk around the yard and talk to my friend from school on the phone. We were laughing about something or the other, and I was enjoying the cool breeze on my skin as the sun set overhead, when suddenly I had this weird feeling. The feeling you get when you're being watched. 

I looked around, then my eyes fell on the driveway, which was surrounded on both sides by trees and curved sort of to the left, so that you couldn't see the road from the front lawn. What I could see, however, several yards away, was a chocolate lab standing still as a statue at the bend, under the shadows of the trees. One with a red collar, tire tracks imprinted on his side, blood soaked fur, a completely crushed and mangled face, and entrails hanging from his gashed open stomach. 

My breath caught in my throat and I felt like time went to a standstill. My friend asking me if I was still on the phone became white noise as I stared at what seemed like Rudy, and he stared right back unmoving. 

We had buried him, far out in the woods where he couldn't be seen from our property as a reminder of what we lost. He was definitely dead, there was no doubt about that. Was I hallucinating? It was starting to get dark, after all, maybe my imagination was playing tricks. 

I turned away from the horrible sight as I choked back a sob. I rubbed my eyes and after taking a deep breath, I looked again. He was gone. I returned to my phone call and quickly went back inside the house, choosing to play it off as my mind fucking with me due to the guilt of Rudy's passing. 

But things were never the same after that. Since my parents are too busy working to drive me, I catch the bus each morning to school. That means walking all the way down our winding driveway and waiting at the spot Rudy was hit for that yellow bus full of obnoxiously loud teenagers to pull up. Every time I walked down the drive, I felt uneasy. The trees lining the gravel path on both sides blotted out the sun and covered me in shadow. Nature was silent and still, when usually birds were singing and squirrels were skittering up trees. I felt like I wasn't alone. 

I waited for the bus, and I felt the skin on the back of my neck burn. I turned around and saw him, closer this time. Rudy. His corpse just stood there and watched me, he didn't so much as twitch, blink, or move his tail. I didn't know what to do, he was blocking the way back home and the house across the street was for sale, meaning the closest neighbor was yards away. An overwhelming sense of fear enveloped me and I staggered back into the road, expecting him to move at any moment. To lunge at me and attack. After all, if he wasn't some sort of zombie, then what was he?

The school bus screeched to a stop dangerously close to me, and this scared me so bad I screamed and fell back on my ass in the middle of the road. I had been so terrified that I didn't even notice it approaching, and apparently the driver hadn't noticed me until the last minute for some reason. When I got my bearings and stood up, I felt utterly flustered. I looked away from the driver's angry face in the windshield to the driveway, and Rudy had vanished again. When I got on the bus, the driver yelled at me, asking if I had a death wish, and a few of my classmates made fun of me, but I didn't care. I was absolutely terrified. My dog was haunting me, and its presence felt hostile, like it wanted me to suffer the same gruesome fate since I couldn't help him. 

I wasn't able to focus on class at all that day. When the bus dropped me off that afternoon, I stood and waited until it left, then booked it down the driveway. I felt silly but at the same time I didn't want to be there long enough to see him again. When I  ate dinner with my parents that night, I was distant and moody, and my mom noticed. 

“I made your favorite dinner and you're just pushing it around with that glum look on your face.” She had said. “Honey, what's wrong?” 

I told her that I was hallucinating Rudy, in his post mortem form at that. I could tell by the looks on my mom and dad’s face that they were intensely uncomfortable at the subject. They had been close to Rudy too, he was an old dog and they had adopted him just before I was born. Yes, he was *that* old. 

“I just wish I'd stop seeing it.” I finished my vent with that. 

After a short moment of silence, Dad grumbled without even looking at me, “Son, you've been watching those freaky movies at night and barely getting any sleep. You can't be surprised you're seeing zombies when you're running on three hours of sleep and marathoning every zombie movie ever made.” 

“Your dad's right.” Mom agreed when she saw the way my face balled up in frustration. “Plis, you've been sleeping past your alarms and missing the bus almost everyday now. I want you to start going to bed earlier and take a break from the horror genre in the meantime. Okay?” 

“Yeah. Okay.” I thought that maybe they were right. I mean, dad was definitely exaggerating about the three hours of sleep thing, but I probably should lay off the scary shit for a while. I don't think I could stomach it anyway, after what's been happening. 

Despite me following my parents’ advice, things got worse. I heard scratching at the door at night, and the whimpers and whines of a dog. My bedroom is on the first floor and closest to the front door, whereas my parents slept like a log upstairs. Even if my mom wasn't a heavy sleeper, she probably wouldn't be able to hear it over the sound of dad's booming snores that reverberated through the whole house. 

I laid there in bed, too scared to get up and check it out. I knew there shouldn't be any dog out there, as far as we knew no one around us owned dogs. Still, I told myself a neighbor's dog got out and had snuck into our yard so I wouldn't shit myself. Let me tell you right now, I'm not a horror movie protagonist, I'm a coward and I'm not the type to go investigating. I run and hide, I don't fight. So no, I wasn't going to creep into the kitchen and peek out the window to see what the hell was pawing at our front door. I did not want to see my dead dog again. 

But, as I listened to Rudy whine and whimper, I thought something sounded off about his voice. I can't describe it, it just didn't sound like him, it was a bit gruff and little too deep in pitch, like a mockery of our dog. Then again, he was dead, so I understood his vocal chords weren't going to be in good shape. Or, maybe his body was possessed by a demon? Either way, the thought of this made it very difficult to fall asleep. 

Paying attention at school was starting to become harder than ever before as I lost sleep due to this. My grades suffered and my parents were threatening me with therapy, or grief counseling as they called it. If anyone at school somehow got wind of that, I'd be cooked, I could already imagine what the guys would say. It all came to a head when one night, the scratching and whimpering started up again. 

I decided that I had had enough, and stormed out of bed towards the kitchen. I was going to be a horror movie protagonist if only to get some sleep, I'd decided. After a few stomps towards the direction of the front door, the sounds stopped, as if Rudy or whatever it was heard me coming. I started to lose my nerve. When I got inside the kitchen, I tiptoed to the window and craned my neck to look out at the porch. 

My blood ran cold. 

Rudy stood unnervingly still on the porch, facing the window. He looked deader than a doornail, and now that he was closer I could see his hollowed out eyes and how his gray tongue hung limply out of his dislocated jaw. I jumped back and yelled, running upstairs to wake my parents. I could barely formulate a sentence as I shook them awake, sweaty and terrified. 

Dad led the way, wielding a Louisville slugger, and mom and I stayed at the top of the stairs, a phone clutched tight in her hands in case she needed to call the police. We listened tensely as dad threw open the door, shouting. However, there were no sounds of any altercation to follow it, just some confused mumbling from him. We met him in the kitchen a few minutes later and he told me there was nothing out there. 

“What did you say you saw again?” Mom asked me, looking skeptical. “A man?”

“No, not a man-” I began. 

“You said ‘he’s out there'!” Dad snapped. 

“I meant 'he' as in *Rudy!”* I watched them give each other looks, my face getting hot as I realized how this looked. 

“Dylan, we all miss Rudy…” Mom said with a sigh.

“No, it's not like that!” I begged. “He's been haunting me! He shows up-” 

“It’s your guilty conscience!” Dad cut me off, a mix of frustration and concern on his face. 

“I have nothing to be guilty about, it was an accident!” I ran to my room so they wouldn't see me cry. I locked the door behind me, knowing Mom would try to come in.

When she tried the doorknob she groaned. “We're going to talk about this after school tomorrow, and we're taking you to a shrink!” 

I heard their muffled voices complain about me all the way up the stairs. I cried into my pillow like a baby. I just missed my damn dog, and I missed having a good night's sleep and not having my parents think I was going crazy. 

The next day, I was so tired I felt like I could pass out. I missed the school bus for the millionth time so mom once again ran late to work driving me there. I could tell she was pissed, she was silent the whole time. I went into the office to check in late, and I saw one of the guys sitting there. 

“What are you doing here late?” Toby, one of my friends snorted. “You look like shit.” 

“What are you doing out of class?” I asked with irritation as I signed my name onto a clipboard in front of the receptionist who was always talking to her boyfriend on the school’s phone. 

“Got in trouble.” Toby shrugged. 

“Already?!” I looked at him judgmentally for already being sent to the office so early in the school day. 

“Whatever, man.” Toby scoffed. “At least I don't play with dead dogs.” 

“What?!” I whirled on him, ready to kick his ass for saying anything negative about Rudy. 

“Easy!” Toby threw his hands up, genuinely surprised by my reaction. “If you're so sensitive about it, why does your family keep trying to use him as a prank?! I mean, you gotta admit it's weird, dude. Alexis rides your bus and she keeps talking about how your dad keeps putting your dog on the end of the road. What's that about anyways, is he trying to scare them? Does he think they're kindergartners?” 

“What are you talking about?” The room felt hot all of a sudden. I was sweating as I tried to connect the dots but couldn't. “My dad is at work everyday by the time the bus comes, and we buried Rudy in an empty field somewhere.” 

Toby frowned. “You know, now that I think about it, I saw your dad once, right? He's this big buff guy. Alexis keeps saying it's a skinny guy with pasty white skin in a black hood. So that wasn't your dad moving Rudy around? Didn't you guys get Rudy stuffed? Or - what's it called, erm… 

*Taxidermied?”*

I stared in silence for a moment as I realized what exactly was going on. “What did she see him do?” 

“She said today that he came out of the woods and left it there, at the end of the driveway.” Toby seemed to get nervous as he caught on to how weird the situation was. “Then he just smiled as the bus went by. She thought maybe it was some kind of prank to scare the people on the bus, since it was like a freaky taxidermy job, I mean, his guts were hanging out. People don't do that when they get their animals stuffed, though, do they?” 

“We never had him stuffed!” I cried out. 

Everything else happened so fast. I harassed the receptionist into allowing me to call my mom, who then called my dad. My mom came by to pick me up, and we went to the house with the police. They searched everywhere, and found that Rudy's grave had been dug up and that someone had been hiding under our house. That's where Rudy's body was found, the man had left him under here when he heard me coming and hid himself in there, too. Dad never thought to check under there. He had been the one to scratch on the door and mimic the sound of a dog whining and whimpering almost to a T. 

They found the nutjob hiding out in the for sale house across the street, he'd broken in and had been living there for weeks. When he was taken into custody, he admitted he'd been watching us, and that he had dug up Rudy, stuffed him himself but purposely left in gruesome details like an intestine and bits of broken bone, and used his corpse to torment me. When I wasn't looking, he would place Rudy out in the open and hide in the trees, and when I left, he would take him back. Then when I kept getting up late he would just display Rudy for the kids on the bus and enjoy their understandably freaked reactions.  

That's why he always seemed so still when I looked at him, it's because he was stuffed! I couldn't believe it. 

The worst part about it was the fact that the asshole was also responsible for killing Rudy. The police told us that he had laughed as he openly told them that he'd laid dog treats on the road to lure him, got into his car, and ran him over. He hid the car in a field by the empty house, which you could access by a wide trail, so that no one would know he was living there. It's how he got around, buying cheap beer and the things he needed to stuff our dog with. He was a mechanic with a weird hobby, apparently, and he'd recently lost his house and had been living in his car before he came all the way out here to squat in that house. 

And why did he do all this? No reason. Absolutely no reason other than the fact he was fucking psycho and wanted to torture some kid for fun. He was charged for trespassing, harassment, animal abuse, and some other bullshit I can't remember. We moved shortly after because mom didn't feel comfortable with the fact that asshole knew where we lived. 

I feel so dumb, thinking Rudy was a ghost or zombie or something like that. I never investigated or stuck around long enough to notice anything amiss. More than anything, I feel angry. I hope that dick has a life full of nothing but misery and misfortune waiting for him. If it weren't for Toby, who knows how long he would have kept it up, maybe he would've escalated things and tried breaking into our house next to place Rudy in there. He was clearly not dealing with a full deck, if his wild eyes and crooked, creepy grin were anything to go off of. 

But at least Rudy can finally rest in peace… we buried him again, and this time, mom and dad spent the money to place him in a proper pet cemetery. Sometimes I go there and lay treats on his grave. He will always be a good boy to me.
