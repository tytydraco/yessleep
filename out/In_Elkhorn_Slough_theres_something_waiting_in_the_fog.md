I remember the nights I spent in Elkhorn Slough years ago, camping out under the stars, foolishly looking to sate my curiosity, I learned things that I wish I could forget, I went to the Slough to find answers about my great-uncle, but I only found trouble.

They say that if you listen closely at dusk, you can hear the cries of the lost echoing over the waters of Elkhorn Slough in California. This serene estuary, located just north of Monterey, has long been a picturesque haven for wildlife enthusiasts and kayakers, lined with tall grass and Cyprus trees, you can lose yourself in the place's seductive beauty. However, beneath its tranquil surface lies a history steeped in mystery and tragedy.

In the late 1800s, this area was bustling with life as settlers flocked to the region, drawn by the promise of fertile land and abundant fishing opportunities. But in 1886, a series of unexplained disappearances shattered the idyllic facade. Families ventured into the slough to fish and gather, but they never returned. Local newspapers, including the *Monterey Cypress*, chronicled the strange events, detailing frantic searches that turned up nothing but silence. The authorities combed the area, but no bodies were ever found, leaving behind a tapestry of unanswered questions. The echoes of their cries transformed into folklore, feeding tales of the “Elkhorn Hauntings”—whispers of dark figures lurking in the fog, watching, waiting.

My great-uncle Thomas was among those who vanished. In the summer of 1895, he set out to fish with his young son, William. They were last seen near the slough, their laughter mingling with the calls of the birds. When they failed to return, the local community rallied to search for them, but after weeks of fruitless searching, the investigation was called off. The absence of closure turned the slough into a place of grief and fear, haunted by the memories of those lost.

Thomas' wife, Agatha, was especially devastated, as you would expect. She had lost her loving husband and her beloved son, but it wasn't just memories of these two people who meant the most to her that haunted her, it was her account of the event she witnessed shortly after she had grown concerned when Thomas and William hadn't returned home, as you will soon see.

Thomas had built a humble but well-equipped fishing shack close to the Slough, originally to store his equipment, as Agatha found the pervasive storage of his rods, baits, and fishing gear in their small home to be irritating to say the least, however, the weather there was unpredictable, and Thomas had frequently used the fishing shed as refuge when the storm raged outside.

Agatha knew that it had been raining throughout the day, quite heavily I might add, so she likely thought Thomas and William had hunkered down in the shed close to the slough while the rain bucketed down on them. You might be wondering why the man went fishing with his son during such miserable weather, Agatha tried to discourage Thomas from taking young William fishing that day, worried William might catch a cold, but Thomas was adamant that he'd take the boy fishing, as they hardly ever got to spend time together.

Thomas was a fisherman by trade and would spend long periods of time out at sea as the Slough was a bad choice for gathering enough fish to make a living off of. Thomas knew William would be going to school soon, as they'd been travelling for so long, putting schooling off until they had finally settled into the little town, this was really the only time he'd be able to go fishing with his son.

In a few days William would be going to school, learning new things, making friends, he'd no longer be the little boy who'd cry in the carriage whenever it got cold as Thomas drove the cart, commanding their stubborn horse as they rode across the countryside, his wife hushing little William and trying to keep him warm. Thomas knew this, and it hurt, so he didn't care if it rained, he'd take William fishing and spend as much time with him as he could, like all fathers should.

Agatha went out to the Slough to see if Thomas and William were still in the fishing shack, the rain was letting up, now a gentle sprinkling compared to the heavy downpour from that morning, she opened the door to the shack, with its tin roof and surprisingly well-crafted windows in their wooden frames, the space inside was empty, aside from the fishing equipment stored inside, she saw that some of the bait was gone, the two rods were missing, along with some other things, so they'd have had to have gone fishing that morning, but outside, she could see the slough, and there wasn't a soul nearby. She scoured the area, searching for them, but a dense fog had rolled in, she could hardly see a thing, so she started making her way back home to get help.

That's when she saw it, when she had reached the dirt path leading back to the town, she turned around, one last look in case her loving husband and son would be behind her, smiling, with a silly story about how they had gotten caught up in trying to catch a particularly stubborn fish or something of the sort, dear god, only if it was so, her account of what she saw got printed in the *Monterey Cypress*.

"I looked back in the direction of the slough, and that's when I saw it, the fog had concealed everything which made it hard to make out the shape I saw, but the fog had begun to part, just in the middle of my field of view, and then I saw it, a tall, thin figure, it was dark as the night and quite large, it was facing me, I couldn't tell where its eyes were due to how it was concealed in shadow, but it still haunts me, that thing I saw, god, I only wanted to find my sweet baby boy and my husband there fishing, I just wanted to know they were alright, that thing, whatever it was, it haunts my dreams, I can't stop thinking that it took them, my family, I can't keep..."

She trailed on about how she couldn't keep it together anymore, not without her husband and son, it was so long ago, but I still remember the sorrow that was in my father's eyes when I asked about his uncle, apparently Agatha died to breast cancer not many years after her family's disappearance, I couldn't imagine how hard that must have been, bedridden, dying, with no immediate family left to be with you in your last moments, my grandmother and grandfather lived far away from Elkhorn, but they did come to visit her during her last few days, she died two days after they left her, I hope I never die alone as she did.

Years later, as I delved into my family history, I stumbled across these stories. Driven by an insatiable curiosity, I decided to venture to Elkhorn Slough in the fall of 2011, hoping to uncover the truth about my great-uncle’s fate. The moment I arrived, the air felt heavy, as if the land itself held its breath, haunted by the secrets of the past.

The day was overcast, with clouds hanging low in the sky. I parked my car along the edge of the slough, the scent of brackish water mingling with the earthy aroma of decaying leaves. I set up camp near the water’s edge, the sound of the wind rustling through the reeds surrounding me. As night descended, I felt a creeping unease, as if the darkness was alive, watching my every move.

That evening, while I sat by the flickering campfire, the flames danced against the encroaching shadows. The soft croaking of frogs filled the air, creating an eerie symphony. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being observed, a shiver running down my spine as the fog rolled in thickly. Stories of the Wraith—an entity said to haunt the slough, using the voices of the lost to lure the living—played in my mind, feeding my dread. But I brushed it aside, convinced that I would find the truth.

The following day, as the sun struggled to break through the fog, I set out to explore. My heart raced as I walked along the marshy banks, each step leading me deeper into the unknown. The twisted cypress trees loomed over me, their gnarled branches stretching like skeletal fingers. I scanned the area, hoping for any sign of my great-uncle.

Suddenly, something caught my eye—a glint of metal half-buried in the mud. Excited, I approached and brushed the dirt away, revealing a small fishing lure, its once-bright colors faded and corroded. My heart sank as I wondered if it had belonged to Thomas. What had happened here?

As I continued my search, I stumbled upon a small clearing nestled between the trees. Here, remnants of an old campsite lay scattered—a rusted kettle, broken fishing rods, and a tattered blanket left behind in haste. I knelt down, running my fingers over the blanket’s frayed edges, imagining the families who once gathered here, their laughter echoing through the trees. The sight filled me with a deep sense of sorrow, but I pushed on, determined to uncover more.

That night, as I sat by the fire, the darkness enveloped me. Shadows danced among the trees, and the soft rustle of the leaves grew louder, filling the silence. I thought of the local legends, the accounts of people who had wandered into the slough, only to be drawn into the depths by the Wraith’s eerie call.

Just as I began to drift off to sleep, I was jolted awake by a low murmur that sent chills down my spine. It was a voice, soft yet unmistakable, calling my name. “Help me… please.” I bolted upright, my heart racing. It sounded just like Thomas. My pulse quickened as I scanned the surrounding darkness, my breath caught in my throat.

I stepped toward the water’s edge, the fog swirling around me. “Thomas?” I called, my voice barely above a whisper. The air felt charged, heavy with unspoken words. Suddenly, I heard a splash, and the murmur became clearer. “Come… play with us… we’re waiting.” The haunting refrain echoed, luring me toward the water’s dark depths. My instincts screamed at me to turn back, yet I felt an irresistible pull, a desperate need to uncover the truth.

Over the next few days, I continued my search, but the presence of the Wraith became more palpable. I found more signs: a small fishing pole with the name “William” etched into the wood, a weathered photograph of a smiling boy holding a fish, his eyes bright with innocence. Each discovery seemed to deepen the darkness surrounding me, pulling me further into the slough’s embrace.

One evening, while organizing my belongings, I heard Thomas’s voice again, clearer this time. “Help me, please.” My heart raced as the familiar warmth wrapped around me, coaxing me closer to the water’s edge. The fog swirled, and I felt an overwhelming urge to step forward, to answer the call. But just as I was about to succumb, a gust of wind swept through the trees, sending a shiver down my spine. I hesitated, the dread creeping in.

I packed my belongings and fled the campsite, racing to my car as the fog closed in around me. The whispers turned frantic, begging me to return, to join my great-uncle in the depths of the slough. “Come play with us,” they sang, the chorus echoing through the mist, growing louder, more insistent.

Once safely on the road, I glanced back in the rearview mirror. The dark figure stood at the water’s edge, watching me leave, its form blending into the shadows. The weight of what I’d experienced settled over me, a chilling realization washing over me. Thomas’s fate was now woven into the fabric of this haunting land, a warning for anyone who dared to seek the truth.

So, if you ever find yourself drawn to the serene beauty of Elkhorn Slough, heed this warning: the darkness beneath its surface is very real. The Wraith is ever-present, the fog is dangerous. Stay away from the water at night, for you may find yourself becoming part of the tragic history that haunts this place, lost among the echoes of the past. Although in all honesty, I'd implore you to never go to Elkhorn Slough to begin with.
