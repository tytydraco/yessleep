After asking several times, I decided to let my mom take my daughter Iris to the movies. They both wanted to go see some new kids' movie that just came out. My husband and I have all the streaming services, so I offered Mom my home to watch it, and we would leave to give them time alone. Not good enough. Mom had to go to the theatre.  
  
My mom has been an addict for as long as I can remember. She'd take money from my dad and go buy whatever she could get her hands on. She would buy from several people, but as soon as dad put a stop to it, she'd get vodka instead. She had been in many accidents with me and or my brother in the car.  
  
But, shortly after Iris was born, I went no contact with my mom. I loved her, but she was too dangerous. She settled down a lot. She still drinks, but only beer now, and I have never seen her drink when my daughter is around. Hell, I’ve even let her babysit for me when I have to work. Granted, my job was only five minutes away from her.  
  
So this was different. I agreed because she was getting better, and I really don't think she will be around much longer. I told Iris to put her phone in her pocket, make sure the volume is off, and zip her pocket. If anything happens to her, or grandma does happen to drink, call me immediately. My daughter is eight going on thirty. She understands and will do as I ask. But still, I'm sitting here in a mess of anxiety waiting for them.   
  
It's been an hour and a half now. I haven’t heard from her yet so everything should be okay. It takes about 45 minutes to get there. I checked and the movie lasts one hour and fifty-six minutes. They should be leaving the theatre in one hour and ten minutes now. Shit, I'm obsessing. Okay, I’m going to go try and write something for now.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
Okay…I've wasted an hour and a half. They should be here any minute now. God, I want to call them so bad. But I think my mom at least deserves the impression of trust. She has worked very hard to be a part of my family.   
  
“Take me for who I aa-” I snatch my phone off the coffee table.  
  
“Iris?”  
  
“Mommy?”  
  
“What’s wrong honey?”  
  
“Um…Grandma got ..*static*.. and I *..static*.. she won’t wake up.”  
  
“Iris, you're breaking up. Try moving around to get a better signal so I can hear you better. You remember the four bars that show up next to your battery, right? That's how strong the signal is”  
  
“Mommy, .*.static*.. Scared. I don't want to move.”  
  
Shit. This can’t be happening.  
  
 “It's okay. I know you're afraid. But you have to. Do you know where you are?”  
  
“..*static*.. Dirt road. Lots…*.static*… trees. Grandma said ..*static..* Scenic route”  
  
“Okay. Are there any signs? Anything that stands out? Focus honey.”  
  
“..static.. Dark. Can’t see.”  
  
“Okay. Go back to the car. Keep trying to get grandma up. If someone comes by, hide.”  
  
“Okay Mommy.”  
  
“I need you to try finding Grandma’s phone too. Turn on your flashlight and search the car. It’s very important that you use it to call 911. But I’ll stay on this phone the whole time.”  
  
“Okay Mommy.”  
  
“Any luck?”  
  
“Mommy, it's not here.”  
  
FUCK. “You looked everywhere? Try again sweetie. And stay close to the car. I can hear you now”  
  
“Okay Mommy. I still can’t find it.”  
  
“You know what? It’s fine. You won't be able to hear me for a second, but I'm still here honey. I’m going to call 911 and add them to our call so they can help me figure out where you are and get you home.”  
  
“Okay Mommy. I’ll wait.”  
  
I have never done this before, so I turn my phone on speaker and mess around on my phone trying to figure it out. There it is.  
  
“Hey Mommy, there’s a car coming.”  
  
“Hide. Now.”  
  
“Okay Mommy,”  
  
“It stopped. I'm hiding in the back seat.”  
  
WAIT. I immediately focus on the conversation.  
  
 “Honey, why would you hide in the car? You were supposed to run and hide”  
  
She doesn't answer me. Shit why is the emergency line still ringing?  
  
“Iris? Iris honey, i need you to answer me so i know you're okay”  
  
A few seconds go by. Every second feels like an hour.  
  
“It’s okay Mommy. This nice man is going to take me and Grandma home and he’ll fix us up until you can get me. Grandma was really good. I hope she gets better soon.”  
  
Click  
  
“Iris?”  
  
The phone drops from my hand just as the operator answers.
