9:33 AM

The morning alarm buzzed, and the phone vibrated on the nightstand. I killed the ringing noise in a second and turned on the other side of the bed. Feeling the cold, empty sheets, I thought Alice left downstairs to make breakfast and coffee.

Down in the kitchen, the fresh smell of toast, bacon, eggs, and freshly ground coffee hung in the warm air. Yet, no sign of Alice. I didn’t worry much because, after all, it was a Saturday. Many days, she liked going out to run and stay in shape. Other times, she wanted to sleep until noon.

My stomach howled as if possessed by three demons simultaneously, and I knew I had to devour that breakfast to make them leave back to whatever hellscape they came from.

11:41 AM

A bad feeling came crawling up my spine. We always gave each other our space and talked about things a lot. Communication is key. That’s why I didn’t want to bother her with calls and texts, but her run was usually about one-hour long.

I tried calling her, but her phone went straight to voicemail. That’s when the panic—like an old friend you’ve never seen in over 25 years— kicked in. And it kicked in pretty badly. Elevated heart rate, heavy breathing, mouth dry as a desert, sweating like a pig under the hot summer sun, and intense nausea. The whole room spun around me.

11:45 AM

I gathered my marbles and sat down on a chair. When the world returned to focus, it felt like an invisible force guided my eyes toward the fridge door. A magnet held a small piece of paper in place. How could I have missed it until now? I took it down and read it.

“Morning, sweetie! I’m out to run and then go to the mall for a few hours. My phone died, and I think the battery is faulty. Will check it at the mall. I left some breakfast and coffee on the table. Will try and call you later. Hugs and kisses, love ya!”

Well, that felt odd. The note was sweet, but why didn’t she stay a little longer so we could talk? Maybe it was just an overreaction, but the feeling of things being wrong still permeated all around me.

12:27 PM

The front door opened.

“Honey, I’m home! Sorry for running away like that, but I did come back, didn’t I? Where are ya?” she said. “Lucas, baby, did you miss me?”

“Hi… How was it?” I replied. “Did you get your phone fixed?”

“Yes, they also cleaned the cache and uninstalled some apps I rarely use. Did you have your breakfast?”

“Yes, it was delicious. I think I had a panic attack, I got distraught when I called you, and you didn’t answer. I saw the note about forty-five minutes ago….” I said.

“Oh, I’m sorry, babe. I didn’t want to wake you up,” she said. She locked the door and touched the handle three times.

“Why did you do that?” I asked.

“Do what, silly? I just locked the door,” she replied. She turned to face me and blinked a few times while the corners of her mouth twitched uncontrollably. Even if it lasted mere seconds, it scared the living crap out of me.

“Alice, are you sure you’re all right?” I asked her.

“Why wouldn’t I be, sweetheart? The air in the woods was different this morning, and I feel energized. Even a bit changed, I don’t know how to explain it, but it feels amazing!” she replied.

Her voice had an unnatural vibe to it, and it made me squirm. Again, things felt wrong. This wasn’t how Alice behaved. She seemed erratic and unaware of her behavior.

She kissed me on the cheek, which made me feel very dizzy. Then, leaping two steps, she ran to the first floor to shower. I didn’t understand what came over her.

3:37 PM

Loud scratches made me realize I had fallen asleep. I had no recollection of when or how this occurred, which felt bizarre. The whole house smelled of wet soil.

I called Alice, but no answer came back. Instead, the scratches grew louder, and a staccato banging made the walls tremble.

“Alice, what the hell is that? What are you doing?” I yelled. This was turning into an unbearable day of confusion and fear.

I went to the bedroom upstairs and opened the door. The bed stood against the wall, the dressing mirror had been shattered to pieces, and thirteen piles of soil, dead leaves, and small branches had been carefully laid on the ground.

Alice faced the wall drawing circles with her bare fingers.

“Alice! Stop it! What is this madness?” I screamed.

“The circles in the woods are beautiful, Lucas. They are perfection incarnate. I saw them in the morning, moving in the clean air. They circled and circled, and the beautiful voice inside them told me to come to visit again,” she said as she finished the last circle.

Thirteen circles on the walls. Thirteen piles of dirt on the floor.

Her dress was all ragged, tattered, and torn. Her hair was a mess with dead leaves and branches that seemed to be attached to her scalp.

I turned her around and saw her fingers all bloody. The nails fell off in the manic process of drawing those circles. The room was shrinking on me like a vice grip on something unnatural and evil that had plagued the house.

Her bloodshot eyes looked through me.

“Lucas, the colors in the woods are so beautiful. You have to see the colors. The colors speak in different hues and shades, and they are perfect. They show things beyond this world. The colors want to come into our world, and I will help them. They said we could have whatever we desire, Lucas,” she rambled.

My eyes welled with tears. Something had flipped inside her head, and she had lost it. A significant shock made my heart explode into a million tiny pieces scattered throughout this vast, unending universe.

“Alice, snap out of it, please!” I screamed, rivers flowing down my face.

The circles started moving clockwise on the wall, the blood dripping endlessly inside them until complete. Then, the dirt began moving too. Strange colors filled the air; it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

“Do you see them now, Lucas? Do you see their true beauty? Do you see the beautiful beings that want to visit us?” she asked.

“Yes, I do,” I replied.

“LET US IN!” a baritonal voice instructed me. “We are hungry for weak minds. Let us in!”

The dirt and blood circles connected and moved. This sort of tunnel seemed to come to life. Then, from inside them, I heard the voices again. They were angry and greedy.

“No!” I screamed. I snapped out of the trance the situation subjected me to and scattered the dirt over the floor.

“What are you doing?” Alice snapped. She lunged toward me and grabbed me by the throat. She squeezed so hard that my life felt like a fleeting memory.

“Stop, Alice… This is not you. Please,” I replied.

She threw me against the wall, and I welcomed the air back into my lungs.

“Let me do this. They need to come, don’t ruin this!” she screamed as she piled the dirt together.

“Alice… Stop it, please,” I whimpered.

She snapped her head back. “SHUT UP!” she screamed, her voice baritonal and grabbed me by the shoulder. “LET THEM COME IN PEACE!”

I heard a pop. The pain that followed was the worst physical pain I have ever felt in my entire life. The world I once knew was gone.

A low hum made the air vibrate like a giant from another planet remembered his childhood lullabies.

I saw hands made of dirt coming out of the tunnel that connected the walls and floor. They were crooked and twisted, the fingers trying to imitate those of a human being.

The humming began again. Bruised as I was, I lunged one more time toward the piles of dirt, trying to stop the process. If those creatures came here, it meant the end of us all. I didn’t get the chance even to reach the dirt. Alice’s knee connected with my jaw and sent me to a place where only nightmares roamed.

I gasped for air and became conscious again. Alice lay on the floor on her back, mumbling words I had never heard before. The tunnels of dirt and blood were still well and alive. I considered them some passage that needed to grow stronger for the creatures to come here.

“Alice, wake up! Alice!” I screamed. I grabbed her head and tried to see if she was still there. Her skin had gotten pale and brown as if made of soil.

She rose and looked up. Her teeth were made of earthen clay and tree sap now. It felt like she was decomposing to become one with the earth.

“It’s almost done, Lucas,” she said.

“No. This ends now,” I replied, knowing what to do. If she was their vessel…

I got in a chokehold and squeezed as hard as I could. She tried to escape, but my pain made me understand this was the only way to end.

With a turn, I broke her neck.

I wailed in desperation, waves of sorrow crashing violently on the shores of my broken heart.

Alice lay lifeless on the floor. The dirt and blood fell too. Nothing made sense anymore. If hell existed, this was it.

My shoulder sent pain spikes throughout my whole arm, and I fainted.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

9:33 AM

The morning alarm buzzed, and the phone vibrated on the nightstand. I killed the ringing noise in a second and turned on the other side of the bed. An unbearable pain pulsated in my shoulder. I jumped out of bed and gasped. It was a bad dream, after all.

Why? What the hell had happened?

I almost kicked the door down and flew straight to the kitchen.

Alice cooked breakfast, and when she turned, I froze.

“Hey, baby… Did you sleep well?” she asked.

“Oh, my God!” I exclaimed. I jumped and hugged her. “I had a goddamn nightmare.”

“Good thing you woke up before you died, right?” she winked.

“Guess so… I dreamt that you died, Alice. But, Jesus Christ, I need to calm down; my heart is going like crazy,” I said.

“Well, I’m here,” she said. Alice came and kissed me on the cheek. “I think I’ll go for a run, babe. The colors outside look amazing this morning. I’ll be back in an hour.”

“Have fun and be careful in those woods. I don’t like it there,” I said.

She unlocked the door and winked at me.
