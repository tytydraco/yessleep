It’s not against my will, don’t worry. I’ve got some interesting work, and this is my first job out of college, so I can’t complain. The professor is really pushy about me getting through this journal, though.

There are four of us here, a skeleton crew. Most of the stone that once made up Thorne Chapel has crumbled into the wetlands around, swallowed back into the eerie Welsh countryside. We did find an almost perfectly preserved record in the undercroft. 

Let me take a step back. We’ve spent the last two weeks in the middle of Bannau Brychheiniog. Don’t even try pronouncing it, Welsh is pretty much impossible.

For those of you who don’t know (I imagine most of you), Bannau Brycheiniog is a national park that takes up a good part of south Wales. The nature out here is beautiful, flat mesas, waterfalls, serene lakes. Unfortunately, we’re working out of a damn swamp.

Our project manager, based out of Liverpool, brought us here after years of petitioning the college for a dig site grant. Professor Yarrow finally got the money together. The problem is there’s almost no documentation. It’s an unspoken agreement of the crew that this isn’t sponsored by the college.

Professor Yarrow explained some of the folklore around Thorne Chapel on the drive out here. Mostly local ghost sightings, a mish mash of old wive’s tales, the usual things that surround church ruins. They were unnerving sure, but it was how emphatic Yarrow was that really got me uneasy.

Yarrow is fine, if eccentric. He insists on isolation while I translate, which is okay because it’s time consuming. This is my first job post B.A, so I agree to most of what he says, even if it feels strange. 

The investigation has been smooth, and within the first week Yarrow easily located the sinking ruins. Within two more days, we found a half submerged chamber and retrieved a few artifacts and a very well preserved journal. 

Yarrow handed me the text and told me to get to work. I’m not sure why, but he had a specific starting point for me, near the end of the book. Usually, one would work from beginning to end, but here I am. I think he’s onto something though, because where I started seems like an important part in this guy’s life. 

The professor halted the dig, and I’ve spent the last *week* translating this godforsaken language into English for Yarrow. He keeps pushing me to move faster, but translating is hard work. The rest of the team has been categorizing artifacts we found, but I’ve been holed up in our farm lodging this entire time. 

Every few *hours* Yarrow comes to check in, eager for some kind of progress. So far, I’ve only translated a few pages, but what we have is fascinating. The recounting of some strange folk practice called ‘sin eating.’ I asked the professor if he knew about it, and he only nodded and left me to my work. 

To his credit, Yarrow was the only one on the team who listened when I told him about the strange smell coming from the book. He listened, but unfortunately didn’t say anything. 

I’m gonna post my work here against Yarrow’s wishes, but it shouldn’t be a big deal. That, and it’s pretty freaky. I figured some of you on here might know something about “sin eating” as a cultural phenomenon. Any insight would be helpful, and would probably make the translation easier. 

The author is extremely articulate for the time and despite the difficulty, I’ve found myself absorbed in his words. The last few pages have especially captured me. There is something eerie in his words, and I can’t tell whether it is some madness or schizophrenia from ages ago or something… else.

I’ve only got a few pages down, but I’ve gotta take a break at this point, it’s been half the day and the words on the page are starting to move around on their own. Here’s the translation. (I’ve added break points where the handwriting or ink color changes, and a break in time is apparent.)

**November 17th 1584**

I had just washed the taste of murder from my mouth when the nun appeared. I sat in front of a gravestone marked ‘Ruth B.’ the ash bread already consumed, and my chalice empty of the sacramental wine. 

Ruth Baker had been dead for several days now, and her sin tasted like hot coals in my mouth. She had killed her husband, but there was no regret in her sin. She, at least, believed it was warranted. 

A sin is a sin, though. Ruth deserved her place in the Kingdom of God, and I sat here with the key like Saint Peter. I rinsed my mouth with cool water, and with it the unfortunate memories Ruth had shared with me. After a deep breath, I turned to the woman who approached.  

The nun was young, in her early twenties probably. She was shapely with a pleasing face, but I quickly quelled any impure thought that rose. Her dress was black and white, the customary frock of a nun. Thick blonde hair curled out from under her habit, like ivy. The church had finally come.  Were they here to bring me in for apostasy? For sacrilege, perhaps? Let them call it blasphemy, they always do. 

“Good morning, Eliphas. Quite pleasant weather out here, wouldn’t you say?” The woman’s soft and smooth voice was nearly impossible to hear over the rolling thunder around. Her cadence was musical, and held the edges of a strange accent. It was her eyes that surprised me, though. This woman had caught me in the middle of my rite, and held no disgust towards me. 

It was always the first thing I noticed. Even after I have done my divine duty, and ensured a loved one’s entry into the kingdom of Heaven, the fear and disgust are palpable. In my youth it had bothered me, but these days I take strength from it. The uneducated peasants who wallow in sin know nothing of my burden, nothing of what I do for them; nothing of how I suffer for them.

I rose and prepared myself. Initially, I thought I was to be tried or put to an inquisition, but instead she handed me a letter. It was clean parchment, and sealed with fine red wax, but the rain had left dark spots on it. Pressed into the wax was a familiar sigil, a family crest that I had known once before. 

Her wrist struck me. On the inner side, there was a mark like a brand. I saw it only for a heartbeat, a circle with waving lines around it. Did this nun have a tattoo? How strange. 

Before I could ask, she spoke. “Father Thorne’s fire has become a flicker. He beckons for your services.”

“I do not concern myself with the living, sister.”

She did not hesitate. “Father Thorne insisted that it must be you. Only you. You have felt the corruption of the church firsthand, have you not? Their faith is but paper against flame. Your’s however, is strong steel.”

The nun spoke in poetry. It confused me, and it took longer than it should have to realize who she spoke of. A name that once held sway over my young mind. Father Thorne.

Many years ago I studied under the priest, then in his late twenties- I in my teens. Seminary had been my goal back then, but life has a way of choosing directions for us, even those we wouldn’t walk on our own. Like Rose. 

Truthfully, I should have told her no. The living are not my domain; that is the charge of the clergy. *Their* purpose, and *their* responsibility. My domain on the other hand, is the dead and forsaken. 

Time and time again nearby churches have threatened me, scorned me, and damned me. Despite this, how could I deny a soul in need? One that I already knew, even if it were in a past life? I carry already the heaviest of burdens, and my life has led nearly a hundred others into God’s embrace. 

**November 19th 1584**

The journey to Wellcourt was two days by carriage. Sister Christine, as I had come to know her, accompanied me. She minded her distance and did not engage in much conversation, but I found her more curious than disgusted with me. Through much of the journey, I found comfort in the Psalms, but to my surprise, my companion had chosen something different. It was not a bible, but she studied it with rigor and notes, as if it were. 

The town of Wellcourt was small, nearly as small as my own. A handful of thatched-roof buildings, boldly outlined with grey mold, lined the throughroad. The peasants here dress in such a strange fashion. Odd black vestments decorated with a crest on the breast, and hemmed with green at the edges. 

When I asked sister Christine about the quite ornate black dress, she explained it was a local mourning custom.  I elected not to pry into the death itself, despite my initial instinct, but I did not find the meandering peasantry to be mournful or reflective. 

The carriage brought us to a stone church, large enough that it pushed against the line of ‘small cathedral.’ It rose three stories high and dwarfed the nearby buildings. Despite its size, the exterior was in disrepair. A war between faith and entropy was waged on the stone facade. 

Creeping ivy vines and moss of verdant green seemed to show that entropy was winning. The primitive and inarticulate stained glass struggled against hazy moss, creating unintelligible scenes from the outside.  I was delivered to the large oak door, strong and ancient by my eye. The church itself seemed to be some archaic monument, around which the village was built. 

I was brought through the altar room and pews, which seemed quite standard. Small groups of worshippers walked about, dressed in their strange dark clothing. Being so accustomed to the customary whites, reds, and golds, I find these dreary vestments somewhat unnerving. I had hardly even noticed that all of the denizens had shaved heads. Only a few days ride from my hovel, and such strange sights. 

“Is Father Thorne attempting some kind of monastery?” I asked

Sister Christine tilted her head and looked around. “No, no,” she said. “It’s more of a unique approach to scripture. The locals hold onto old superstitions, and Father Thorne has come to understand a more earnest approach to redemption. Many locals believe that hair holds negative memories, so during confession Thorne offers to shave them. They leave the church with light shoulders and a new life.” Christine clicked her teeth, and gave a rueful smile. “The two centuries without papal guidance have set us quite backward, I’m afraid.” 

We ascended the stairs to the third-floor study. Sister Christine and an attending nurse have been in the next room caring for Father Thorne, while I peruse his library.  To my surprise, there is quite a fair amount of secular literature here, written in many different languages that I don’t recognize. 

Thorne has requested me for three days, and unease has begun to creep into my heart. How different will this be? What will live, fresh sin taste like? Never in my life have I been asked to do something like this, and I’m unsure of my capabilities. Even at that, there’s only one other’s sin’s I’ve had to consume who I had known in life. Rose. She however, had already passed.

No matter, this is my lot in life, my burden to bear. I am the only one who can carry weight like this, and I shall continue to do so.

—-

My first experience with Thorne was difficult, as expected, and I can tell there is more to my charges here then I’ve been led to know. For this reason, I will recount last evening with more precision than I usually do in this diary.

“You’ve grown a beard.” Father Thorne said his voice hoarse and full of decay. “I was afraid you would wait until I was sleeping in the churchyard.”

I nodded to him. “Thorne, it is good to see you. You’ve grown ill, I see.”

Thorne seemed amused by that, but the sight of his earthly vessel’s decay was hard to look upon, even for me. I took a deep breath and continued. “I must admit, though, I'm unsure of my purpose here. You do know what it is I do, Father? I’m sure a priest-“

Thorne cut me off with a violent wet cough, rife with sickness. 

“I know what you are, Eliphas. I called for a sin eater, not a priest.  I don’t want these words to leave. You have no one to speak to- no place to judge. You’re exactly what I need.”

A sad grin crept across Thorne’s lips, like some centipede in search of shelter, attempting to retreat after an attack. “Plus, I’ve already one foot in the grave. It can’t be much different for you, no?” 

Despite myself, I laughed. The dead do not have a sense of humor, and I was in no right to reject the request of last rites. In one way, I should have felt respected for the request, but the anxiety of the awaiting rite held me back.

I began setting the black candles that I had brought with me around the priest’s bed. Next to the head of the oak wood frame I laid my prayer mat, basket of bread, and chalice. Thorne waited patiently; quietly. The silence was welcome, as I did not really plan on conversation.  We had both become very different people, and the inevitability of my looming suffering weighed both my mind and body down. 

Despite the two decades since my wife’s death, I never really knew what to expect from the ritual, every soul was different; defined by its unique desires and impulses. I have never felt lonely at a gravesite, and by the end, I know quite well who the person was in life. Having the person still alive, speaking to me, is what frightened me now. 

“Do you still paint?” Thorne asked, breaking the silence of my preparation. 

“No, my duties take up my time.”

“A shame. What about your scriptures?”

I bit my lip, this was the prying I had feared. “That I do keep up with.”

“And what of Rose? You’d talk about her all the time, but I never met her. Did she come with you?”

That one cut deep. He had no idea what happened, just that I had left the abbey one morning. Or did he? Was he picking me apart for some kind of examination, like when I was a child?

I took a deep breath to steady my hands, and I arranged the incense around the circle of candles. “I live an entirely different life now, Thorne.” 

With chalk, I drew the geometrical patterns I had learned over the years- concentric circles and three triangles flanked by the awesome and terrifying names of God. Each triangle breeched the first outer circle, and encompassed one of the Hebrew names. 

There is no was to really explain how I had developed the circle. I had added to it over the years, experimenting with what brought more power to my ritual. The majority of these advances had been through my own intuition, and they worked. Casting the circle was one of the more frightening parts of my rite, and led to accusations of witchcraft if someone came upon me in a graveyard. 

The now lit thurible began to radiate with the smooth blue smoke of frankincense and copal, until the room was clouded in the fragrant haze.

When I asked if he was ready, Father Thorne sat up in his bed with a struggle. “As I’ll ever be. Let’s get going, I don’t have all day.” An abrupt summation of our years apart.

I began with the lord’s prayer and the invocation of St. Cyprian. I was surprised to see that Thorne had no objections to my invocation, as this is what usually began the allegations of heresy. Strange, the differences of separate sheep of the same flock. If it bothered him, he did not make it evident. Afterwards, I placed ash bread on his chest and nodded for him to begin.

“When I first arrived at this parish, I knew nothing of its people or its customs. Despite being so centralized, the people here speak their own strange language,and only a handful of people spoke Latin here.” Thorne let out a weak laugh. “These people didn’t trust me. They missed the last priest. There was something special about him, I’m told. None of them would bring me into the fold. I needed to know these people, so I searched through my predecessor’s belongings.”

Thorne’s face was tight and twisted in thought, seemingly manifesting his words moment to moment, through labored breath. There was more to this than simple thievery and snooping. There was more to the sin he was pushing onto me. I nodded for him to continue.

“His journal was… illuminating.” Thorne began. “Strange artifacts in the undercroft, the strange habits of locals, but there was something more in his chest. I knew that I shouldn’t have touched it. Hell, I don’t think it should have seen the light of day.” Thorne’s words trailed off, losing himself in the memory.

At this point, I had begun to make circles around the wine with the censor to consecrate it. I stared down at the black bread I was to consume, a fetid taste already coating my mouth. In an attempt to continue the confession, I spoke. 

“What was it?”

Father Thorne shook his head. “Something older than this church, older than anything I’ve seen, Eliphas. It was a skull. A small one, like a child’s, covered in layers of red and black wax. I-I could feel a heat from it, almost like candlelight. I riffled through Smith’s journal, and found only a single passage about the relic. He found it in the undercroft.”

The memory was broken up by another loud and decrepit coughing fit. Thorne attempted to catch his breath and speak through the affliction, but I could made no sense of it. 

When the coughing subsided, I coaxed him. “What did you pull out from this place, Thorne?”

He spoke with an urgency now, through gasping breaths.“Deep below this crumbling ruin, there is enlightenment. Upon a pedestal, the Crown bequeathed me a new tome- a new bible. Not one of a saint, or any earthly man, but of something more!“

Thorne’s words had been too much, and he fell into a fitful slumber. The confession was done, for now. Though I did not know the entirety of his sin, this was my moment to see what plagued him.

The dead are usually regretful of the transgressions they made in life, but it is distant. An emotionless apathy that looks back on life as one does childhood.  The priest’s whirlwind of twisted emotions and mystery were fresh, and full of something more than regret. 

Despite my growing disgust, I know my lot in life- my personal service to my Lord. I tore a morsel from the ash loaf on his chest, and placed it under his black and swollen tongue. He was, to my surprise conscious enough to swallow. 

From his hand, I made a small cut on the palm. Thorne’s blood was thin and devoid of vitality or color, but there was enough to fill inch to the chalice. I mixed in the consecrated wine, along with myrrh, and prepared myself.

The sin tasted hot that night, as if it were bread baked with fresh peppers. Each mouthful burned my lips and tongue, and cheeks. It was difficult to swallow and hard to chew. The bitter wine assaulted me with a sharp acid that reminded me of rotting lemon. 

All these were flavors I had known before, tastes that the dead had placed on me before. Tonight however, it was stronger. More pungent. 

Each bite of bread weighed me down, one small stone after another- pulling my body closer to the ground. The wine landed in my belly with a sickening, sour slosh, circling like a whirlpool that pushed bile upwards to my mouth. 

I persisted through the rancid meal; each sip and bite harder to consume than the last. The meal’s potent, fetid flavor grew more intense- until it became almost unbearable, even for me.  The taste of ash and acid. The taste of blasphemy. 

Father Thorne must have still been slightly conscious, because I heard some manner of speech come from him. “Thank you, Eliphas.” What a strange thing, to hear it in words- in person. I had never truly been thanked before. 

Nevertheless, I was grateful for the reprieve. My body was threatening to revolt. A strong hand gripped around my chest, claws closing in around my heart, holding me in fetters while my stomach churned. Thorne’s eyes opened halfway, dim and yellow.

“Have you no words for me Eliphas? Or is it just ‘sin eater’ now? No words of wisdom?” 

Fighting back the coming onslaught of bile, I replied. “You wanted a silent witness.”

A decomposing laugh escaped the priest’s throat. “A man of God speaks of dark magics and mysteries, and you’ve nothing to say? Did I teach you nothing?”

I was already standing and heading to the door.“If I were to seek absolution from someone, I would not criticize,” I replied, suppressing my retches. As I left, I heard his wet laugh from the room.

In the courtyard outside I found a water bucket, presumably for the dogs, and attempted to wash the sin from my mouth. The taste of transgression never really leaves one’s tongue, but running water helps somewhat. *This* taste, however, refused to subside in its acrid intensity. 

As it festered in my mouth, I came to understand the subtler notes like burning iron. Hints of wrath amongst the more forward flavors of confusion and desperation. This was when I truly knew that there was more to his story than he let on. 

Sister Christine caught me by the hound bucket, as I was cleansing myself in a manic frenzy. Seeing her shocked me into a more respectful and controlled manner, but the damage was done. The gardeners and strangely dressed acolytes were staring at me, and there I found the fear and disgust I was so accustomed to. To my surprise, Christine gently helped me to my feet, and helped guide me to my quarters. 

Along the footpath, Christine held my hand. It was warm, but her touch of life against me was foreign, but not unwelcome. I felt her wrist brush against mine, and it felt like hot iron against my skin. I pulled my hand away, it had come from that mark on her wrist. 

“Your heart carries much.” She said. I was unable to respond, my senses chaotic from the sickness in my body. I simply nodded. 

These quarters are humble; much better than my own living arrangements. A true bed, as opposed to rotting straw; wood floors instead of dirt. Unfortunately, there is a mirror and vanity, and I caught a glimpse of myself. I have gained a little weight, thanks to the food that the priest’s men offered during travel. 

The lines around my eyes were deeper and darker than the last time I saw my reflection, though. I had not the bravery to look at my teeth or gums. The rot I’ve consumed over the years has taken its toll, and there's no reason to remind myself of that. 

When I turned from my reflection, hate and defiance lingered. It was hard to tell if it was Thorne’s sin or my own disgust with the mirror. Nevertheless, I could feel the echoes of Thorne’s confession digging into my soul like the gnarled roots of an oak tree.

——

After the candles had been snuffed in the church- near midnight, I decided to go for a walk. I had hoped the fresh air would help clear my mind. The strange village had settled into my mind like the foreign chatter of its inhabitants. A narrow hallway led from my quarters, lined with portraits of the former priests, surprisingly back to the 1200s. 

There seemed to be a two-hundred-year gap, from 1350 to 1575, when the last custodian before Thorne took charge, Father Rowan. It seemed as if this church had been forsaken through those missing years, leading to its current condition. From the strange customs and state of the village itself, it seemed as if the entire place had been forsaken. 

The portrait of Father Rowan was relatively ordinary, almost crude. He had been a thin man, with sunken eyes and a trimmed black beard, according to the artist. There was a red gold halo surrounding the priest’s head, a painting of blaspheming deification. Vanity and pride. The man’s image was set against a background of twisting black ink vines. 

The ominous vines were painted in exquisite detail, each one with thorns and leaves of dark green and pitch black.  The background had just as much, if not more detail than the portrait itself.

As I investigated the portrait, I was alerted to a sound from below. Someone having a conversation? Curious, I snuffed my candle and headed downstairs. The stairwell led to the oratory where lines of pews led up to the main deas, which was very ornate in comparison to the rest of the church. 

Behind the pulpit, Sister Christine was talking to a young girl in a hushed voice. The girl was around ten, by my estimate, and dressed in rags. The nun held her by the hand and led her down into the undercroft. I did not approach, so I was unable to hear the nun’s hushed words or the girl’s response. 

Something about Christine unnerved me, but I could not tell what it was. She wore the same frock as earlier today, and outwardly, nothing was amiss. It was her hushed words. They carried through the pulpit, almost as if the words meant for the child were weaving their way through air to me in quiet whispers that I couldn’t quite understand. They scratched at the edge of my mind like mice in the walls of my hovel.

Christine opened the door to the undercroft, and for a heartbeat I could hear chanting below. The words were foreign, but the cadence was similar to Latin mass. No, they were similar to my own words to St. Cyprian, hushed and secret. small cuts of There were half words that I could almost understand, but the chants went quiet as quick as they began. 

The girl followed Christine downstairs by the hand. As they passed the threshold, the child turned her face, and met my eyes. It was the briefest moment, but I could see a strange, eerie contentless in her misty grey eyes. There was recognition of a greater purpose in this small child, something that I once had worn myself. I do not know how to explain it, but those eyes reminded me of Rose, when we were still children, and I shuddered against the memory. 

After they had descended, I made my way forward to investigate. I didn’t attempt to descend into the undercroft, but instead my eye was caught by the pulpit. The bible was cushioned by fine silks, and flanked by striking gold statuettes of strange chimeric creatures. There were three, each distinctly made with skilled hands. 

The most striking one seemed to be an amalgamation of a rooster, with serpents where feet should be. There was another book underneath the bible, bound in grey sheepskin with no cover adornment. When I opened the book I saw that the ancient parchment was without ink. The tome was completely empty, but by the condition of the pages and spine, I could tell it was used often. 

Strangely, the book felt familiar in my hands. I could fight through the mists of my mind and come across a strange script of aggressive and sharp curves inside the pages. I cannot explain it, but it felt like some distant memory of a fiery speech I had made many years ago. How had that happened? I had never been here before.

I was shaken out of my hazy memory by a loud rumbling sound below. Instinctively I returned the pale grey book to its spot on the pulpit and rushed away. The dim candlelight of the room revealed nothing around me, the sound must have come from the undercroft. When I heard footsteps coming up the stone stairs, I rushed back upstairs to my quarters. 

I haven’t had much success in rest so far. My mind is racing with thoughts of the girl and strange artifacts. Should I ask Thorne about it? Or perhaps I should investigate the undercroft myself? 

Strange sounds echo through the walls around me. They sound like whispers, a woman’s voice. Christine perhaps? Is she stalking the pulpit below?

Regardless, I must remember my purpose-my higher calling. No matter what strange things are happening in this church, I am here to bring absolution to this priest. I have already been damned, and even if it only one more soul I can save, it is my charge.

This is as far as I’ve gotten so far. You can see why I’m not sure what’s going on. Obviously this guy is disturbed, but his hallucinations seem to be vivid by his recount. I’ve never heard a peasant so eloquent before, it’s really fascinating.

I can’t really explain why, but typing this in English online felt strange, like I was shining light on something that wasn’t meant to be known. It’s an invasion of privacy sure, but it’s more than that. I’ve struggled with mental health issues, and I wouldn’t want anyone to know, even six hundred years later. 

It just makes sense to share it. What a weird contradiction. At a certain point, it felt like my fingers were moving without even looking at the paper notes. 

Anyone here have any insight on this stuff? I think this is a new first. Yarrow claims that the first mention of “sin eating” is in 1686. This account is an entire hundred years earlier, and it’s *first hand*! 

I’m kinda wrapped in the discovery myself, and looking forward for Yarrow to show up for his usual check in now that I’m so many pages is. I’ll let you guys know when I’ve got the next day’s worth of pages translated.
