I awoke in the middle of the night with a stabbing pain in my belly and an urgent need to defecate.

When I say urgent, I mean *urgent*.  I was afraid to move, afraid that doing so would somehow trigger Diarrhea-mageddon before I was safely on the toilet.  But if I stayed put, I would shit the bed.  If I moved, I at least had *some* chance of making it to the bathroom, however remote it may seem at the moment.

So I moved.

The moment I found my feet, my stomach began to gurgle ominously, and the pain intensified; it really felt like a red-hot blade being driven into my gut.  My teeth sank into my bottom lip as I tried not to cry out, not wanting to wake my fianc√©e.  Things had been crazy for her at work this past week, and she was pretty tired; I wasn't about to disrupt her well-earned rest with my middle-of-the-night tummy trouble.  I just needed to get to the toilet.  Everything would be okay.

Well, that's what I told myself, at least; I sure didn't *feel* like everything was going to be okay.  I was practically doubled over in agony as I shuffled across the hallway to the bathroom, clutching my stomach with both hands.  I was sweating, both from the pain and from a sudden, crushing feeling of dread.  I couldn't tell you why or how, but I suddenly knew, with a terrible clarity, that this was no ordinary bout of diarrhea.  No ordinary stomach virus or food poisoning.  Something was *terribly* wrong, and I was completely at its mercy.

I made it to the toilet without soiling myself, and almost sobbed with relief as I collapsed onto the seat, my legs wobbly and weak and giving out at the knees.  The relief was short-lived, however.  The knife in my gut was now being twisted around, sending searing lightning bolts of pain all throughout my body.  Sweat poured down my face, mixing with the tears I was now shedding.  Us women experience some pretty intense stomach cramps every month, if you know what I mean.  But this was far, *far* worse.  I felt like I was dying.

Whatever this was, I had to get it out of me.  I braced myself against what was to come and let go.

It exploded out of me with a vengeance, complete with wet fart noises so loud I feared they would wake not only Sarah, but the entire freaking apartment building.  It kept coming and coming, pure liquid diarrhea gushing from my ass like a spray from a high-pressure firehose.  Drops and splatters landed on my bare ass, and on the backs of my legs.  But the pain slowly began to dull.  I had been right.  I just needed to get it all out.

Once it was over, I stayed sitting on the toilet for a good five minutes, not wanting to risk getting up in case I was in for a round two.  But my bowels were calm once more, the sweat cooling on my face, and I felt better.  Not great, but nowhere near as awful as before.  The worst, it seemed, was over.

Oh, how wrong I was.

I gripped the towel rod for support, shakily stood up... and gasped as a new sensation took hold, an immense pressure in my anus.  Like something big was lodged there, straining to get out.

Hovering over the toilet, I pushed--and something flopped between my legs.  A hank of hair.  Coated in a greasy film, its exact colour was hard to pinpoint--but it looked red.  Like the hair on my head.

My head swimming with confusion, my throat tight with mounting panic, I grabbed the hair and pulled.  It was slippery, and felt like it was attached to something.

The something inside me.

Hyperventilating, I began to pull.  It budged.  I pulled harder.  It budged some more.  It was big and hard and might just rip me open, but I didn't care.  I wanted it out NOW.

I pulled and pulled and pulled... and out it came.

It split me in two.  Not really, but that was how it felt.  I howled as the pain tore through me.  The edges of my vision turned white.  Hot blood was streaming down my legs.  I tossed whatever it was into the toilet with a wet plop.  Behind me, the closed bathroom door rumbled with three hard, frantic knocks.

"Jess? Jess!"  Sarah was wide awake and panicked.  "Jess, what's wrong? I'm coming in!"

The door slammed open, and a second later, her arms were around me.  "Shit! Jess, you're BLEEDING! What the fuck happened?"

What the fuck HAD happened?

"Something... something was inside me."  My voice sounded garbled.  I looked down into the toilet bowl.

Something looked back up at me.

Floating in a fetid pool of diarrhea was something with matted, filthy red hair; rheumy green eyes; a sunken nose; and no lips, just a ragged tear for a mouth.  A grotesque replica of a head.  MY head.

It blinked those watery eyes.  Flared those crumpled nostrils.  Then it GRINNED at me, revealing a mouth full of rotten brown teeth.

I think it might have started cackling then, but I can't be sure, because any and all other noise was drowned out by my screams.
