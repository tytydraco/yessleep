background info:
I live in a apartment with my boyfriend and we are both 18 and probably the youngest in our apartment complex. We live on the second floor. The apartment is in a sketchy part of town where I live.

A few days ago at about 9:30 at night I was in the bedroom watching YouTube and I had the window open. All of a sudden there was a honk in the parking lot right below my window. Not a small little quick one. A long and loud one. It went on for probably about 5 full seconds. I didn’t think much of it at first because this was something that wasn’t new. People are dumb and loud and clearly don’t care.

Anyway, after the loud honk I heard a man outside and he started yelling. He started to swear and say racist things. I knew it was the man below us because he had just moved in and I knew for a fact he was white. So I was a little shocked at first hearing what he was saying.

I thought he would stop swearing after a few minutes but he just stayed out there yelling. I looked out my blinds and he had a flashlight on circling cars. I thought maybe someone hit his car but I don’t really know what exactly happened. 

It was about 10 now and he was still outside swearing. I went to the living room and grabbed my boyfriend and told him what was going on. I asked him, 

“should I call the police? Or a non emergency number?”

He just shrugged it off and said I was overreacting which, honestly I can be sometimes. He left the bedroom and I just stayed in the bedroom silent listening to my neighbor. I was contemplating if I should call for help. He could be having a mental crisis. I didn’t and tried to let it go.

The time was about 10:45. He was still outside. I looked out the window more but never saw him. The light was off.

Around 11 it finally stopped. So I had thought. My boyfriend came into the bedroom ready to go to sleep. I told him how worried I was. While I was talking to him I heard a noise from outside our front door. I got up and looked through the peephole. There my neighbor stood staring down at our door. I immediately started to cry and shake. I ran to my boyfriend quietly and told him to look in the peephole. When he looked our neighbor was on the floor by another door still swearing up a storm and then I looked and he had moved and stood in-front of our neighbors door. 

At this point I was terrified. After a few minutes he came back again. He was circling the halls. 

An hour later he stopped showing up. I told my boyfriend I wanted to barricade the door. That night after we tried to feel somewhat safe i didn’t sleep at all.

Idk what his deal was. I can only think drugs but holy shit. 

Thanks for reading. Me and my boyfriend are moving next month. Wish us luck!
