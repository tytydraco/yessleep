I need help. Desperately.

My sister is going to kill me.

I suppose calling her, it, my sister is wrong. She's not my sister, it has no relation to me whatsoever.

I don't know what it is, or how to stop it. I have been running since I found out. Since I discovered. Even now, I struggle to come to terms with it. I remember.

I remember the day Mom gave birth to her, I remember helping raise her, she was the fourth child, fourth of six. I remember watching her take her first step. I remember hearing about her first word. I remember helping her learn to ride a bike. I remember rocking her to sleep. I remember it all. Everyone did. But it is all a lie.

We were always a pretty tight knit family, we always took pictures. Mom loves pictures. Every time anything she concidered important, which was a lot. She had pictures our first time walking, of our first time riding bikes, of our birthdays, of us in the park, of us napping on the couch. Pictures of all of her children. All five of them. Until I turned seventeen.

I didn't even realize, until I was going through old photos, putting things away after Mom died. After she, it, took her.

For a bit of context, I am now thirty five, and for the first seventeen years of my life, I was the second oldest of five children. Then Savana showed up. And she was the fourth child. She was ten. We have pictures of her, with us, doing everything with us. But not before I turned seventeen. When she showed up, it was like she was there all along. Everyone was happy. We love, loved? Savana.

It is hard, hard to hate her. I still love her. My little sister. But she's not. I know she's not. But I... But I believe that she is. I remember. I remember her.

Uncle Bradly died a month after she arrived. He had gotten sick, then died. A shock, a sad affair. He was always so big, bigger than the world to us. He was the awesome uncle, rode a Harley-Davidson, wore leather, took us fishing, hunting, and out to bowling, all with a missing hand. A combat veteran. Got it shredded, then amputated. A great man, who looked rough but held a depth of love that is hard to express.

His death took us all by surprise. Even Savana.

A year later, Aunt Rachel died. Same thing. She got sick, then died. Little more than a shriveled husk of what was once a very bombastic person.

So many people died. All of them falling ill, surprises every time. We morned, we wept, we recovered, and moved on.

Then Cynthia died. My older sister. By this time, we were terrified. It was only us. Only those of us in our family. At first it had been just those on the outside. They were all dead.

Brad, my brother, named after Uncle Bradly died next. Then my father. We did everything we could, we went to specialists, the best doctors, the best hospitals, even looked to some crackhead mystics at one point. None of it mattered. They kept dying. I'm the only one left. Aside from Savana.

When I found the pictures, or lack of them, I confronted Savana. I demanded to know.

She laughed. She said it was so easy. So easy to get us. She told me I had a year left. I bought a gun, twelve gauge. I had to buy it off an old hillbilly. It works decent, not great, but well enough. I found her, living in our old house.

I couldn't do it. I couldn't shoot her. I love her too much. She's my little sister. I still remember. Why do I remember?

I tried, trulg I did. But I couldn't. I couldn't do it.

I've been running for the past eight months.  Trying to get away. But I keep on seeing her. She's getting closer. My time is almost up. I don't know what to do, how to stop her. Can I stop her? I can't kill her. I don't even know if a weapon would harm her. But I can't pull the trigger. I love her too much. She's my little sister.

I don't know what's to do, I don't know how to escape. Why is she doing this? Why did it choose us? Why does it hurt so much? I just want to stop it all. I have to stop her, or warn other people, if I can't. I wish I could stop her, but I don't know how.

She looks like us too. But now that I know, when I see her, if I look too longer, it's strange. I can't put my finger on it, but she doesn't look right. Something, I don't know it is, but something looks wrong. Something is wrong.

If anyone has any idea, on how to stop her, it, whatever it is, please, help me. And if you don't hear from me in four months, assume I failed. Assume I'm dead.

Check your pictures, old family photos. Make sure, your family is real. I don't know if there are more like it, I hope there are not, but just in case. Please. Check your pictures. Don't let it take them too...

I saw her earlier today. I stopped in at a dollar general. She was the cashier.

I ran.

I didn't pay for my stuff, I ran.

I don't know. It might be too late. I have to stop her. I miss her. I love her. I hate her. She took everything from me. My darling little sister. I want to see her again, desperately. But I have to stop her. Can I stop her? I don't know. Please. Help me. I need help. Please. She's going to kill me. I can't stop her. I don't know how.

If you can help. Please do. If not, please, keep yourself safe. Keep it away as best as you can. If you can.

I need help.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I need help.
