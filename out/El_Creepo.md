As long as I can remember I've always had an extreme phobia regarding mirrors. In fact it's so bad that my parents removed all the mirrors in our house and even convinced the schools I attended to remove them from the boys rooms. The other boys actually brought hand mirrors with them to school which was nice of them to accommodate me. Of course it was the parents and school administrators who did the accommodating, not the kids.



The kids themselves teased me relentlessly about my phobia as well as my other quirks. Due to this I pretty much kept to myself. I didn't go out at all after school or on weekends until about halfway through high school when I began to venture out to the local mall and other nearby locations within walking distance of my house.



My name was Max, but years earlier the other kids had given me a fairly mean spirited nick name: "El Creepo". No matter who I asked or how often I begged, no one would give me an explanation for why I was being referred to this way by the other kids. The teachers wouldn't even explain it. They just acted annoyed by the question and said they didn't know or that they didn't have time to talk with me about it.



Once I began going out to the mall, I noticed everyone looking at me with the same look on their faces. It was as if they were all terrified of me. Small groups of children would often run away from me screaming for no reason at all. 



I went to a Catholic church once when they were having confession. I entered the booth and for the first time in my life I had a conversation with someone who really seemed to care. The priest listened to me explain my problems and told me to say some prayers. I was so relieved I was crying. I exited the booth and sat down nearby so I could get a look at the Priest when he came out and thank him. The confessional booths prevent the sinner and the Priest from being able to see each other so that people can remain anonymous while confessing.



About an hour went by when the Priest came out. I looked at him with glee and warmth in my heart. He casually glanced over at me and stopped dead in his tracks. His expression immediately changed to that of repulsion. "Oh no", he said as he approached me pointing to the door, "Out!" 



One time I went to give blood at the Salvation Army. I could see the woman at the reception desk look up from her work and notice me through the glass doors. She quickly got up, beat me to the door, and flipped the open sign to "closed" while shaking her head 'no' with a sour look on her face.



There was a girl named Jenny at school that smiled at me once. She wasn't attractive to me, but I thought it was so nice of her to show some compassion. One day I was outside between classes and running late after the bell had rung when I noticed that she was running for the door behind me. So I stopped and held the door for her.



As she approached the door, that same old look of terror and disgust came across her face. As she darted passed me I could see tears welling up in her eyes. I was so moved. She was feeling sorry for me! She was crying with a heart full of sympathy! I was on top of the world. I sat through class oblivious to what the teacher was saying because Jenny cared about me as a human being. My faith in the human race was renewed. 



About three quarters the way through class a student "runner" came in and whispered something to the teacher. These "runners" were seniors who spent one class per day assisting the school administrators. I think they got some kind of work experience points for it or something. The guy kept glancing up at me as he whispered to my teacher. He left and the teacher called me to the front of the class. She told me the principal wanted to see me in his office post haste.



When I got to his office, some woman in the front room told me to sit in his office and wait for him. I was sitting there for about ten minutes when I heard Principal Brooks talking to her. 



"He in there?", he asked. I didn't hear an answer but I did hear the sound of what sound like a walkie talkie type radio. Someone was talking on it in a kind of mumble. Then there was a short "beep" sound as Principal Brooks entered the room followed by a police officer.



The cop spoke up. "This the guy?" he asked.



Mr. Brooks replied "That's him" as he took a seat at his desk. The cop just stood there behind me to my right.



Principal Brooks then addressed me. "So you want to tell me what happened?"



I had no idea what he was talking about. I shook my head and told him I didn't know. 



"Come on Max. You know what I'm talking about," he said. I shook my head 'no' again. "You know Jenny Hartford?", he asked.



I almost laughed it was so ridiculous. "I don't know her," I replied, "but I know who she is."



"You know she's dating Paul Kincaid don't you?" I nodded. "You know he's on the wresting team right? If it were me, I wouldn't want to get that guy on my bad side. In any case, the girl's not interested in you. Can you grasp that?" I nodded again. 



This couldn't be about my holding the door for her, I thought. It just couldn't be! It was too absurd. I literally had never so much as spoken to her one time. I never called her, followed her around, or even looked at her for more than the fraction of a second in the halls when she'd coincidentally pass through my eye-line. As Mr. Brooks spoke, the pure idiocy of the insinuated accusation started to cause a laugh to rise up from my stomach and spill out of my mouth repressed into a mild chuckle. Upon hearing it, Mr. Brooks stopped mid sentence and glared at me with a scowl.  



At that point the cop spun my chair around and leaned in to glare at me eye to eye, then raised his voice. "You think this is funny Max? You think scaring young girls half to death is some kind of joke?" I shook my head 'no'. He continued: "You know she's crying and hiding in the girls bathroom right now as we speak? Afraid to come out cuz you might be waiting for her outside in the hall? You know that? Do ya?"



"What?," I muttered, "I didn't do anything that would make her think that."



"So she's lying to us huh? That what we're supposed to believe? I tell ya what. I'd believe her over you any day of the week. How bout you Mr. Brooks?"



Principal Brooks nodded as his scowl intensified.



"What did she say?" I asked nervously.



The cop started up again. "She said you intimidated her. She thought you were going to attack her. You knew she had to walk through that door to get to class on time so you stood there and made her go around you glaring at her the whole time like a god damn psychopath!"



This was as humiliating as it was hard to believe. "I suppose she misunderstood my intentions," I said "I was just holding the door for her."



Principal Brooks stood up and pointed at me. "Yeah right! I guess you help little old ladies across the street too don't ya? What do you take us for? Come on Max, we all know what kind of guy you are!"



I was dumbfounded. What in the hell were these two fools talking about? I refused to say anything more until I got to call my mother. She came and picked me up from school. The cop gave me a written warning and said if there was ever any more trouble from me, then I'd be heading for Juvenile Hall. That's jail for kids. 



I got grounded for the rest of high school. I spent that time looking at the floor as I walked the hallways lest I incur the wrath of another one of my fellow students and wind up in front of a Juvy Judge who might have a similar irrational outlook as that of the Principal and that cop.



After high school I got a job digging ditches for an earth works company. I'd get dropped off by the dump truck driver in the morning with a shovel. I'd have to dig out the weeds on the side of the highway before getting picked up at about four PM.



Every once in a while they'd send someone out with me who had some court imposed community service to serve. And wouldn't you know it. One day they sent out Paul Kincaid, Jenny's boyfriend. I just didn't talk to him. I didn't need any trouble.



We stayed pretty far away from each other most of the time and just focused on our work. Lunchtime was approaching and that had me nervous. When it came I sat down on a fallen tree's trunk an opened up the Kiss lunchbox that my uncle had given me. That's when Paul spoke up.



"El Creepo, you got any cold drinks? I'm dying in this heat." I shook my head 'no'. He went on. "You know, Jenny's working at the Piggly Wiggly now. She said she saw you lurching around there last week. Eye-ballen her. I tell you what Creepo, Happen again and we gonna lock horns. Get me?"



I looked up at him confused. "I was there with my mother. We were buying groceries. I didn't even look at her."



"Bullshit," he said. "she told me you were staring her down the whole time. She almost had to clock out and go home for the day she was so upset. So you calling my girlfriend a liar? Is that what you're doing Creepo?"



I didn't say anything. I was done going back and forth with literally everyone over non existent crimes I supposedly committed. We finished out the day's work without speaking again.



It was about two weeks later when I saw on the News that Jenny had been brutally murdered. Her body had been found in the alley behind the Piggly Wiggly grocery store where she worked. It had been laid in a dumpster. I knew I'd get the blame. I figured the smartest thing for me to do was to flee the area. I also knew that doing so would make me look guilty but as far as these locals were concerned I was already guilty so I actually stood a better chance elsewhere. Maybe I could contact a lawyer in another city and agree to turn myself in so long as I could be held and tried there instead of in the town where everyone already thought I was some kind of psychopath. I could make the case here to the judge upon arrest but I honestly didn't think I'd live long enough to do that.



I didn't have a car or a driver's license. Hell, I didn't even have a picture ID. I didn't need it to work because I was working under the table for a friend of my mother. At any rate, I just packed a few things in a backpack and headed for the woods. 



I could take the wooded area behind the high school to the edge of route 34 and follow it all the way to Monroe, the nearest real city. I was heading into the school grounds when I saw a police car headed my way. I also noticed the silhouette of several people walking along the road. It looked like they saw me. I heard some shouting and noticed them starting to run towards me as the police car pulled up next to them. I was identified. So I ran.



I was almost to the treeline when I got tackled from behind. Three guys I recognized  from school started kicking and punching me. I tried to block their blows with my arms but that only worked a little bit. A couple minutes into this a cop walked up shining his flashlight in my eyes. The beating stopped. I was terrified and shaking uncontrollably.



"Well, well, well. Who we got here boys? Looks like El Creepo on the run" he said. "Whatcha running from Creepo? You're wanted for killing Jenny Hartford. I'm taking you in."



One of the boys spoke up. "He'll probably get off on insanity."



The cop put his hand on his face and thought a minute. "Probably right. I tell you what though. If he tries to kill us, then we got a right to defend ourselves." The three boys laughed. I mean they were really hooting and hollering. "I think I'll take him down to the station and let's see if he tries to escape. You boys meet me down there I need your testimony how you found him out here."



About a half hour later I was put into a small holding cell. The room had blue/green paint on everything and a single cot. I was trembling in fear and crying. I instinctively examined the room as if to see if there was some way out. There on the wall in front of me was an uncovered mirror. Christ, I'd never even seen my own face. I couldn't die without knowing what my own face looked like. My life was a tragedy already but that was too much to bear.



I forced myself despite my phobia, to stand up and hobble over to the mirror. Gazing upon my own image, lit by the blueish tint of the jail's florescent light, and peering back at myself I stood there in abject horror at what I saw. At who I really was. At what an atrocity I had been all these years. No. Not an atrocity. An abomination. A god forsaken, grotesque, abomination.



My nose was tilted to one side and turned upwards, revealing wide nostrils which gave everyone a perfect view right into my head, displaying every nose hair and bit of snot that might happen to be there on any given day. My eyes were crusty and hazed over with whitish cataracts. I had a uni-brow and unkempt hair. My neck had large visible veins which bulged out like a swollen inner tube. My skin was all pimples and blackheads on a base of blue spotted yellowish-white leathery skin which had wrinkles across it like an unmade bed sheet. My mouth was crooked with jagged teeth and drool running out.



No wonder! It all made sense now. The children running away, the disgust, the fear, the taunting, the hate. It wasn't me they hated, it was how they saw me that they hated. It was who I appeared to be to them that they hated.



But surely they were smart enough to know that you can't help how you look. That I was born looking like this. Surely even these small town clods understood that my face isn't who I am on the inside. That it's not the real me. 



Of course they knew that. But they just didn't care. My empathy for them gave way to disappointment which in turn gave way to disgust for them and then finally as the cop and the three boys beat me to death it collapsed into hate and rage. And in my dying breath I spoke a curse upon the town and vowed vengeance if at all possible from the grave. 



As I rose up above my lifeless body, looking down on my killers as they high-fived each other, I could feel it coming on. My mind connecting with the universe. I saw everything. I saw Jenny's killer. It was Principal Brooks. He'd been fantasizing about it for years. There was a suggestion trying to wind it's way into my awareness. It was to forgive them but I was already burning with rage and hate as that is the state I was in when I had died. 



I realized that the dead do have power just as the living do. While I knew others move on to the light and do grant that forgiveness, I also knew that doing so was a choice. I chose to stay. I chose revenge.



And so I manifested back into the physical world and by choice even more hideous than before. I've posted this account online just now from Paul's computer. His lifeless body sits next to me now as yours will soon, for I'm not stopping with this little town. You expect me to believe that it's only these people here who are like this? Come on man, what do you take me for? I'm starting with everyone who reads this. That's right, I'm looking in through your window right now at you reading. Come to the window won't you? Pull back the curtain. I've got something to show you.
