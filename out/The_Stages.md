*A week now.*  Some part of me still tells myself he'll love this cool snap when he gets back from the hospital,.,

But he's as back from the hospital as he's ever going to be.  Cancer works fast when it gets to your liver, then your kidneys, then your pancreas.  You hold out hope because you need to, they need to, everyone really fucking needs to, but some situations don't warrant much hope, no matter how much better it makes everyone feel.  Sometimes you get hand-deilvered to your wife in a tiny cardboard fucking box on a sunny Friday afternoon, too.

*2 weeks now.*  It just really, really hit me today that he's gone forever and not just that, as if it weren't enough, but the world is still spinning despite it all and I have so much to do.  It feels overwhelming.  What I want is to lie on my couch and just cry.  Again.  I'm so ineffectual.  He tried to prepare me but I fought it so hard.  As always, I should have listened to him.  He was the brains and the logistics.  I haven't done this on my own for almost 20 years.  I don't think I fucking can.  I really don't.  I really don't think I fucking can.

I started therapy.  I had a lot of questions about hating myself and missing him and also about WTF is wrong with my hormones.  I literally went on a chat site to "aid my marital aid", so to speak.  It was so stupid, I feel guilty, but Dr. Blatty says it's completely normal after losing your partner.

*2.5 weeks now*

I went back to work today.  I can't afford to miss any more, nor do I want to take advantage of a great thing.  I managed to get through the day.  I didn't even cry until I got home.  It feels almost a little better to get back to life.  But my house is a wreck, my life is a wreck, my heart is a wreck...

We moved far from home, it's no one's fault I'm alone right now.  Besides, the dog is my constant companion, forever napping at my feet, except when I lock myself in my bedroom alone for a bit.  
It's strange... I can't seem to go in there.  Except when I need to hide away and, well, take care of myself.

*3.0 weeks now*  I met a guy at a bar and he bought me a dry martini, but I didn't go through with it.  Instead, I went out and bought a new toy, with a clit-stimulator and a g-spot thumper.   And I went back on that rando chat site again.  I legit made my username PLSDNTPLLOUT.  RIP my inbox.

I got a message from someone local, apparently only six miles away.  I could really use a little confidence boost, and that's not to mention a good fucking.  But not tonight.  I've had too much to drink and I really need to get some rest.

*08AUG2024* I don't like to use the proper date but I'm feeling like I'm making too many entries here, anyway.  Fuck it.  Four fucking years I've waited, hoping for a miracle, rarely touched.  ANYONE would let themselves go, so fuck your judgments, thanks.

All that being said, I may have played it a little fast and loose with my internet safety tonight.  I kinda gave out my phone number to a horny chat.  Then I promptly fell asleep, because anyone can be a ho, but some of us really suck at it.

I was trying to sleep on the couch because I can't quite see going into our  bedroom yet.  And I guess this guy kept messaging me on this chat app and I didn't notice he was going from 10 miles to six to four.....

I answered my phone once, I won't make that mistake again.  "You're broke.  You can't afford wine but look at you pissing yourself drunk, crying over photos and tv shows and all your sad, sick self-pity.  You disgusting fat fuck."

"What?"

"Look at you, look at you look at you!"

I hung up.  I left the phone on the coffee table.  I went to work without it.  The hospital wasn't going to call me with an update.  He was ashes on my mantle.  There would never be another frantic call, another difficult decision, another chance to kiss his face, another moment's joy in my miserable life.

"The Bottle is next to you, just there.  Pour a drink.  It's hot out, add one of your silly ice cubes."
