In the underwater cave system known as the Wakulla-Leon Sinks, there is something called the Squeeze.

It is a two foot by two foot underwater tunnel filled with sharp rocks, and a strong current. It is of an unknown length and leads to an unknown destination.

Only three people know about its existence.

I saw it for the first time on a video made by my cave diving instructor, Dave. Cave diving, for those who don’t know, means strapping on scuba gear and going where no god-fearing person would ever go: the flooded depths of the earth.

Imagine all the intensity of caving, all the beautiful sights, and all of the tight spaces where getting stuck might mean breaking your collarbone to get out.

Now do it underwater, strapped to bulky air tanks, and half blind from all the silt you’re stirring up just by breathing.

That’s cave diving.

When I saw the video, I didn’t recognize the Squeeze at first. My instructor had to rewind the footage. He paused it, then pointed. “There.”

I squinted. It looked like a shadow under a pile of rocks.

“It’s bigger than it looks,” Dave promised. “We aren’t sure how far back it goes.”

He explained we would be going past the Squeeze on our way into our scheduled dive. It was right next to another gap that led to the exit. Both looked almost exactly the same.

If we weren’t careful we could mistake one for the other and risk getting stuck.

“Have to be aware of every eventuality,” my instructor looked at me seriously. “One mistake too many,” he snapped his fingers.

Done-zo. Sayonara. Goodbye.

Dead.

We moved on with the lesson, but sometimes, when I was supposed to be reading a safety manual or memorizing our route through the cave, I saw him staring at the still from the video.

The look in his eye, it was almost…longing.

Dave was a weird dude, but to be honest, we all were. We liked risking our lives. For fun.

The next day, we set off on our dive.

My instructor had a special spot for cave diving. He was a purist, and complained that the popular local diving spots had become overcrowded. The sport was gaining notoriety, and now it  seemed like everyone wanted to try it. The best places usually had four or five dives scheduled a week, and it was impossible to schedule a time without booking it two months in advance.

But Dave had a private cave only he and a few close friends knew about.

It was about an hour out of civilization, in a thick grove of oak trees on some old farmer’s property near Tallahassee. Just to get to the cave, we had to climb all our gear down into another cave, the entrance being a tight fit between two large boulders.

After about fifteen minutes of walking, we reached our destination at the bottom

A black pool.

I remember flashing my light over the surface. It made my stomach jump a little. Rather than reflecting the beam, the dark liquid seemed to suck in the illumination.

We got out our gear and got to work.

I had done one or two practice dives in swimming pools with Dave. But this was my first cave dive. Dave had assured me that we weren’t going to do anything crazy. This was routine stuff. Even though there were sections of the cave that were a bit of a tight fit, it eventually expanded out into a large bell shape that we could explore at the bottom. It didn’t even break 30 meters in depth.

He was confident we would be fine. He mapped out this cave himself, knew it like the back of his hand.

Once our gear was on, we entered the pool.

Our dive lights were bright, but still the water had a strange opacity to it. Dave had warned me it might. There was a lot of silt in this cave, decayed cave rocks dissolved by the years and liquid surrounding them. But we hadn’t stirred up much yet, I could still see the guideline that would lead us in and out, so I was able to calm myself down.

It’s important to be composed when you cave dive. Panic can kill you if you’re not careful. At shallower depths, it multiplies the mistakes you make. In deeper situations, it can increase your heart rate, increasing your breath rate, giving you something called Nitrogen Narcosis.

At first you feel like you’re drunk. Eventually you pass out.

You pass out underwater, you drown. No exceptions.

The first part of the dive went by without a problem. We got to the narrow part of the passage, the exit gap Dave had mentioned earlier. Pushing through was uncomfortable, but I was prepared. Dave had made me practice going through a similar gap in full gear on dry land, the “tunnel” consisting of printer paper boxes stacked on top of each other.

He wasn’t taking any risks with a newbie.

As I felt the rock brush against me, I was unnerved knowing there were two tons of unforgiving earth above me and countless tons below. I felt myself run cold thinking that even with a subtle shift, Both could come together and squash me so completely that the only thing left of me would be a cloud of murky blood, silt, and shattered bone for Dave to swim through.

I tried to control my breathing. Before I knew it, I was through.

As Dave made his way through the exit gap, I felt my attention drawn to the Squeeze.

The hole looked bigger than it did in the video. Darker. It pulled on my flippers, like a toddler tugging for my attention. The pull was an underwater current Dave had warned me about. I didn’t even realize I was staring long and hard at the opening until Dave waved his light and got my attention. He was through and ready to move on.

I cleared my head, and checked my gear.

All set.

We continued on.

The cave opened up into the bell shape, and for the next twenty minutes we looked in awe at rock formations, shined our lights on different oddities, and explored every nook and cranny that caught our attention. Even with our masks on and regulators inserted, I knew that Dave was grinning like a little kid. The energy that he had, even underwater and weighed down with gear, was infectious. He jumped from formation to formation so quickly I struggled to keep up. He was in his element.

The hour we had planned was up too soon. Dave checked his pressure gauge, and gave a half-hearted signal that it was time to leave.

We started our ascent.

We took things slow, making sure to readjust to the pressure. The bends are just as dangerous in cave diving as they are in the open ocean. We finally got to the passageway at the top of the bell, and came to the exit gap. Dave went through first. I checked my gear, keeping an eye on my air. I was above two thirds, which was considered within the safety parameters, so I wasn’t anxious. It didn’t even faze me when it was my turn to push through the gap. I was too busy thinking about all I had seen in the cave below.

However, what did freak me out was getting to the other side and not seeing Dave.

At first, I thought he had just gone on ahead. But it was dark except for my dive light. Not even a distant beam around the corner. I started wondering if his light had gone out. But when no other light came on, I knew something was off. Dave carried three spare lights at all times. Years ago, he had gotten stuck in a cave without a backup and had to pull himself out blind. He was paranoid about it happening again.

Then, a horrible realization hit me.

Dave went down the wrong path.

He had gone down the Squeeze.

I had taken my eyes off of Dave for a moment to check my air. When I looked up, I couldn’t see him, so I had assumed he had already gotten through the exit.

I doubled back, and forced my way through the gap I had just gone through. The narrowness of the passage now terrified me to full effect as I tried to not get stuck while going through as fast as possible.

When my tank scraped against a low hanging portion, it felt like the earth was warning me. Telling me not to go back.

I ignored it.

I got through. I found the Squeeze and looked in. I felt the pull of the current and scanned the darkness.

In the distance, I saw the flash of a dive light, and a glimpse of a flipper.

Dave was in there.

For a moment, I hesitated. If Dave got himself into trouble, the only way I would be able to help him was if I went through the tunnel myself. Even Dave didn’t even know where it led. It could be a maze of tunnels, with plenty of places to get lost. Or it could be a dead end, meaning we’d have to swim out backward and blind since we couldn’t turn around.

It was dangerous.

But I was Dave’s dive partner. I was all he had down here.

I pushed myself into the Squeeze.

It was easier than I thought to make progress. The current was stronger inside the tunnel then outside. The slight pull grew to a  frightening strength, like a thousand hands grabbing my body and pulling me forward. I heard the sharp clink of my tanks on the rock, and I prayed none were sharp enough to puncture the metal casing.

I was hundreds of feet from the entrance. If my air failed, I was too far to make it back in a single breath. 

I felt my wetsuit catch on long rocky protuberances like fingers. One was so sharp it even tore my glove and cut my hand. I winced, putting my dive light on it and watching my blood cloud, pulled by the current further into the depths. I swallowed and continued pulling myself forward with my hands, my flippers useless in the tight space.

All the while, Dave’s light went deeper and deeper into the passage.

The Squeeze took a downward slope. It got narrower, and the current got stronger. I had to take an awkward position to keep my tanks from hitting the sharper rocks. I pressed against the cave wall to fight the flow of water and slow my descent.

One of my handholds broke. My stomach dropped.

I tumbled forward, and was thrown headlong through the Squeeze.

I closed my eyes and waited to hit a rock, for my tank to burst, and for it all to end.

Nothing happened.

I opened my eyes, and looked around. The Squeeze had opened up. It was a vast space, so large I couldn’t see the walls. The water was black, blacker than it had been in the pool, and seemed to take all light and stop it in its tracks.

I couldn’t tell up from down. It was like I was lost in space, weightless and isolated.

Then I felt the thrumming.

It wasn’t a sound. It was a movement, like a great beating of wings, or as if the earth itself was trembling. It throbbed through my body at regular intervals, passing through my flesh, my bones, my brain. Slowly, the beat of my heart aligned itself to it. For a long time, I didn’t think, I just let the thrumming move through me. It was strangely relaxing.

Then Dave’s dive light caught my attention.

It was moving down, down, down. It was so quick, I knew Dave wasn’t sinking, He was actively swimming. I started after him. He was disoriented, he needed to be swimming the other way, I needed to get to him. I needed to save him.

I descended fast, paying no attention to how deep I went. I needed to reach Dave. I was panicking. I didn’t register the pressure growing on my face, my body, my ears. I didn’t notice how cold the water was becoming.

Then, below me, Dave’s light flickered and went out.

The thrumming stopped.

I had a sudden moment of clarity. I checked my air gauge. It was broken from when I had tumbled through the Squeeze, but even without its reading I knew I was low on oxygen. Dangerously low. I had no idea how long it had been since I had passed through, but I knew it was long enough to be serious.

I needed to get out. If I didn’t, I would die.

But that meant leaving Dave.

It took a moment to make the decision, but I reluctantly began to swim back up toward the Squeeze.

It was tiring. Even in the vastness of the space, I felt a current pulling me down, like the entire cavern was a siphon. I dropped weights, trying to lighten my load. I dropped extra lights, unneeded materials. I needed to get out. The thrumming began again and grew stronger. It felt like each of my individual teeth were vibrating. My air started to get a stale taste. I knew it was only a handful of minutes before CO2 poisoning would kick in and I would start seeing spots.

My joints started tingling. I felt tired. I couldn’t stop to repressurize. I had to keep going. The air was running out.

I reached the roof, and for a heart stopping moment, I felt panic. I couldn’t see the Squeeze.

But then, a strong current blew past me. I looked toward its source, and there it was, the Squeeze. Waiting like a gaping, rocky esophagus.

I reached the entrance, pulling on the rocks like a manic climber. The current was so strong, it felt like I was lifting three people out instead of one. I traveled hand over hand in the narrow space, feeling the rocks shifting underneath my fingers.

I couldn’t stop or be cautious. My strength was failing. I had to keep going.

I was halfway up the passage, when one last thrum went through my body. It shook me to my core, each bone reverberating like ripples on a pond.

There was silence.

Then, a searing pain ripped through my head

It felt like a railroad spike was being jammed into my ear. The pain was so bad, it almost made me spit out my regulator. I bit so hard, the plastic casing cracked. The world began to spin, like those teacup rides at amusement parks. I couldn’t get it to slow down. It took all I had to cling to the rocks, trying to ride out the pulses of pain that wracked my head with every heartbeat.

As I tried to manage the pain, my only dive light flickered once, then twice, and then failed.

I was in the dark.

I couldn’t think. Everything was spinning, and everything ached. It took tremendous effort even to breathe. On instinct, I pulled myself forward, hand over hand, rock by rock. It felt like I was working against a hurricane. The passage grew narrower and more sharp rocks punctured my wet suit, feeling like digging claws grasping me, holding me back. I ripped through them.

Each gasp of air felt thinner and thinner.

Still I climbed, hands trembling, flippers helplessly digging into the side walls.

When the bright spots appeared in my darkened vision, I prepared myself for death.

Then I felt my hand burst out into an open space.

Powered by adrenaline, I pulled myself out. It took every remaining ounce of my strength. I fumbled around on the cave wall, and panicked again when I felt only rocks. Then I felt a small piece of nylon. The guide rope. I touched it gently, not wanting to tear it from the wall. I found the exit gap, and pulled myself through. It felt like I was being born again. The world was still spinning, but the current had reduced to its earlier innocent gentle pulling.

I got away as fast as I could. 

I followed the guideline up, through the passage, and finally to the dry cave.

I broke the surface of the underground pool, tore out my regulator, and took in deep breaths of wet air.

It took an hour to crawl out and call the police. I passed out mid phone call.

It took another hour for them to arrive.

They got me into a hyperbaric chamber as soon as they could, but the damage was done. I had gotten an air bubble in my inner ear, and a severe case of the bends. Any sense of balance I had was destroyed. I couldn’t stand up on my own, and most of the movement in my hands was gone. I would need to learn to walk again.

But that wasn’t even the worst part.

I contacted Dave’s friends and told them what happened. They set up a recovery dive so they could get their friend's body. No one kidded themselves, Dave was dead. He had been in the cave for a week at that point. His friends hoped that the gases in his decomposing corpse would bring it up to the top of the Squeeze’s cavern, making things easier and safer.

But when they got to the cave, they found something even worse than Dave’s bloated body.

The Squeeze was missing.

They showed me the footage. Its opening had been replaced by smooth rock, no trace of the crag that had been there before. Dave, in his secrecy, had told only one of his friends about the Squeeze. The rest questioned if it had even existed. They went through Dave’s footage at my request, and even there, the video had changed.

What had once shown the Squeeze, now showed just a smooth face of rock.

They searched the rest of the cave. Nothing. The place where Dave had died no longer existed.

Everyone thought I was lying. Only one of Dave’s friends believed me, the one Dave had confided in about the secret cave and the Squeeze. He tried to get the others off my back, but it wasn’t long before a police report was filed.

I was accused of murdering Dave.

After a year-long investigation, and the police finding no motive or evidence, the charges were dropped. It’s been three years now. I’ve lost contact with most of the people I knew in the diving community. I sold my diving gear and focused on healing, learning to walk again and regaining some of the use of my fingers. I’ve been content to stay on dry land, work my nine to five, and try to forget what happened that day in the cave.

But recently, I’ve been thinking about the Squeeze.

Sometimes at night, I’m back in the expanse. I feel the thrumming, the pulse of the earth. I close my eyes, and instead of cold, I feel warmth. I feel the water itself embrace me, and despite the ache of my old injuries, I feel whole.

I open my eyes, and see Dave swimming up to meet me. He doesn’t wear gear, and he’s full of that same little kid energy that was so infectious. The energy that convinced me to try cave diving.

He opens his mouth to tell me something.

Then I wake up.

Last week, I began repurchasing diving equipment, stocking up on lights, air, a suit. Got about a thousand feet of guide rope and a spool. Have to make sure I’m prepared.

I’m going back in. There’s something waiting for me there.

If I get back, I’ll let you know how it goes.
