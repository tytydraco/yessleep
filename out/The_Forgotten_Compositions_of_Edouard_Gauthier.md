***\[Transcript starts\]***

&#x200B;

**Young:** Right, so we’re starting the recording now. Thanks again for taking the time to chat with me, Miss Hart.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah, for sure… this is about Ashley, right?

&#x200B;

**Young:** It is, yes.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Right… so where should I start?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Why don’t we start with your relationship with Miss Hall?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Sure. I um… I met Ashley Hall while we were at Upper Lake University. We were both in the music studies program. Upper Lake doesn’t have the most prestigious music program but it’s still decent and by going there, I could focus on my studies while staying relatively close to home. It was a win/win. Ashley was in a similar boat. Her father lived in Sudbury, and he wasn’t in the best of health. Studying at Upper Lake was better for her than going anywhere else. She didn’t really have anyone else. She’d lost her mother when she was a kid, so she and her Dad were really close. Honestly, I’m pretty sure she wouldn’t have even been attending school if he didn’t push her to do it. Upper Lake was their compromise. She could study music like she wanted to, and she wouldn’t need to leave him behind while she was there. If there was ever an emergency, she could be back home to be by his side in about half an hour. Honestly… I understood. I knew what seeing a family member in the hospital was like. I’d watched my grandfather succumb to cancer a few years back, so when she talked to me about her experiences with her Dad, I could relate to it and I knew how to help her through the harder days. I think that’s part of why we ended up such close friends, actually.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. Grief has a way of bringing people together, doesn’t it?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah, it does. I guess it was a morbid thing to bond over but, we did bond over it… and she *was* a good friend. I don’t mean to imply for a second that she wasn’t! I was always a little bit jealous of her, though… I never said it out loud but, I was. Ashley and I were both pianists. We’d both been practicing since we were little, but while I was good, Ashley was… well… she hated the word *prodigy,* but I really don’t think there’s any other way to describe her. She could play most tunes by ear, even some fairly complex ones and when she played, it was like all of the air had been sucked out of the room. She seemed so lost in what she was doing, so consumed by the music around her. It was captivating to watch. She used to say that when she played, she was able to forget about all of her problems for a little while. She could just get completely lost in the music. It was therapeutic for her, I think. But she never attributed her skill to raw talent. She attributed it to hard work. Nothing else. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see. That jealousy didn’t put any strain on your friendship?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** No! Not at all! If anything, she gave me something to aspire to! I wanted to be just as good as she was… and to her credit, she did *try* and help me reach her level. *Try* being the operative word. Don’t get me wrong, I did learn a lot from Ashley, and I’d like to think I’m a good player in my own right. But no matter how hard I practiced, no matter how much work I put in, I could never be as good as she was. It was frustrating… but I never hated her for it. Like I said… I kinda looked up to her. She had so much talent, but she never flaunted it. She was proud of it, sure, but she was never haughty. She never looked down on others, rarely boasted, and was eager to teach whenever she could. If she’d wanted to, she could’ve gotten into Julliard *easily…* but instead, she chose to study at Upper Lake University. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** For her father.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yes… looking back, I can’t help but wonder if she would’ve been okay if she got to study anywhere else. Maybe if she didn’t have to stay so close to home, she never would’ve found that book…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Why don’t you tell me about that book, Eliza?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Right… well, for starters, I never actually found out where she got it. Ashley said she’d found it at a store in town, but she never told me which store. All I know is that I’d gone over to her place to practice one night, and when I got there I could hear the strangest music out in the hall. Intense and booming, a relentless crescendo of notes being played on her piano. It almost didn’t sound like music. It almost sounded like someone was hitting the keys at random, but there was clearly a melody there. Something humming beneath all the chaos. The music was loudest outside of her door, which was unlocked when I tried it. I stepped inside, the wild music seeming all the more deafening as I did.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Ashley was playing this?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah, she was sitting at her piano when I came in, eyes shifting between a book on her sheet music stand and the keys in front of her. She had that look of trancelike focus on her face, hands moving deftly across the ivory keys as she tried to play whatever it was that was set before her. She didn’t even seem to notice me coming in, not until I’d been standing right behind her for several minutes, watching her play with an almost morbid fascination. Then she’d put on this sheepish smile and the bizarre music stopped.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did you get a look at this book?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I did, actually. I asked her about what she’d been playing and she showed it to me. *‘The Forgotten Compositions of Edouard Gauthier.’* I didn’t recognize the name so I took a look at the blurb on the back.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I don’t suppose you remember what it said?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** As a matter of fact, I do… ‘*Renowned for his legendary skill but dismissed as a madman, the history of Edouard Gauthier is wrought with tragedy and despair. A gifted pianist whos aetherial works were said to shake a listener to their very soul. Gauthier failed to achieve the success of many of his contemporaries. Regarded as a madman, Gauthier spent most of his life either destitute, in poverty or committed. Tragically, many of his works have been lost or destroyed. What remains has been collected in this volume, along with the tragic story of Gauthier’s life, a grand testament to his memory to preserve his story and his works for future generations.’*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Hell of a memory, Eliza!

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Thanks. I’ve always been good with stuff like that. I might’ve gotten some of the wording wrong, but that was the gist of it. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** So what did Ashley say about the book?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Plenty. She seemed pretty fascinated by the whole thing. She said she’d heard of Gauthier before. Apparently, he’d studied under Alexander Scriabin. He was a Russian composer. I guess the comparison wasn’t too out there. Scriabin was known for his dissonant musical language that was tied with his own metaphysical beliefs. His works were… intense. Not really my cup of tea, but I knew that Ashley enjoyed them. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I’m familiar with his work, actually.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Oh… right… sorry. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** It’s fine, it’s not a name you hear tossed around all that often. 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah, exactly! Sorry… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Just relax, you’re not in trouble or anything. I’m not grading you, okay? We’re just… having a conversation. 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Right… right… um… anyways. Ashley seemed pretty fascinated with that book. She started telling me about how Gauthier’s own religious beliefs tied into his music. How a lot of his songs were intended to be like… prayers, to the Gods he worshipped. Apparently, he seemed to think he could *talk* to God, through his music and even claimed he’d used his music to… well… to travel to ‘*other planes of reality*.’ She even showed me a little bit of the one song she’d been practicing. ‘*The Malvian Psalm.’* I can’t say it’s what I would’ve pegged as church music. It was just… way too chaotic for a hymn. Ashley said she hadn’t really perfected it yet, but I’m not entirely sure *how* she could’ve perfected it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Interesting. I suppose that makes sense. What are hymns if not prayer in song? 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I guess, but this was just… I don’t know. Listening to it kinda made my head hurt. I ended up steering the conversation away from Gauthier. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Although that wasn’t the last time she discussed him with you, was it?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** No. It wasn’t. For the next two months or so, all Ashley seemed to talk about was Gauthier and that book. I'd usually hear her trying to perform his music whenever I went over. Like I said, the music usually made my head hurt but… I didn’t really *mind* her latest obsession. Especially since I could kinda see through it.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What do you mean?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I mean… she never told me what was going on, but I could see it written all over her face. She was looking for a distraction. It wasn't hard to guess why.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Her father?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah… it was clear to me that she wasn’t ready to talk about it yet, so I left it alone. I figured that when she was ready, she’d say something to me. I just sorta let her dive into Gauthier… was… was that wrong…?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I don’t think so, no.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** But maybe if I’d seen the signs, I could’ve…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Eliza, there’s no way you could’ve known what was going to happen. Please… don’t blame yourself for it.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I… 

&#x200B;

*\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Young:** Do you want to take a short break?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** No… no, I’m fine. I just… I knew that there was a lot on her mind and I just wanted to let her keep her mind off of it. I figured it was the best thing I could do.

&#x200B;

**Young:** I understand. And it wasn’t the wrong thing to do.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Wasn’t it?

&#x200B;

**Young:** You can’t blame yourself, Eliza. You had no way of knowing.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** No… no, I didn’t… did I?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Can you tell me what happened next?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Ashley’s Dad died… I guess I’d know it was coming. He was really sick. And I’d known she’d take it hard too. I tried to be there for her, I really did! But…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Grief is a difficult thing for people to process, sometimes. 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah… and like I said she took it hard. She stopped coming to classes, started shutting herself inside. It was… it was difficult to see her that way. I tried giving her space at first, texting her to let her know I was there if she needed to talk. I figured she’d come to me when she was ready. But after a while, I started to get worried! 

&#x200B;

**Young:** You checked in on her?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah. It was about two weeks after her Dad died. She hadn’t been responding to my texts, so I swung by her apartment. I figured I could take her out, get her out of the house… get her to talk to me… something.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What did you find?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I could hear that piano music from down the hall… it hurt my head, just like it always did. I don’t know why the neighbors weren’t pounding on her door to get her to stop. She was playing faster than before. It was like… like some sort of whirlwind of music, chaotic and beautiful all at once. It barely even sounded like piano. By the time I made it to her door, I was actually starting to feel sick to my stomach. I knocked a couple of times, but she didn’t answer. She’d left the door unlocked though, so… I just opened it and went inside. That’s when I saw her.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What kind of state was she in?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** She was thin… pale… hadn’t seen sunlight in a while. She looked like she hadn’t even showered. Her hair looked stringy and dull. She used to have really bright, blonde hair. Now she just looked… she looked dead. And she just sat at her piano, eyes fixated on the sheet music in that book and playing frantically. She didn’t even respond to me when I spoke her name. She didn’t react until I put a hand on her shoulder. And when I did, she looked at me like… like she was confused. Like she’d never seen me before. She asked why I was disturbing her… and she told me to leave. Said that she was close to finishing her work.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Her work?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yeah, I asked that same question. And she just… she just started rambling at me. Talking about how Gauthier had figured it all out. How he’d figured out the language of God… it didn’t make a lot of sense to me at the time. It still doesn’t.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What exactly did she say?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** That Gauthier knew how to speak to God… or… maybe Gauthier had *become* God, by learning how to speak like Him using music. It was hard to tell. She said that she was learning the language and that she wanted to… I don’t know. Either she wanted to send a message to God or… or she wanted to send some sort of message to the universe… it was confusing. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** What were her exact words?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** She said: *“I’ll write it so that he’ll come back to me! I’ll write it so that he was never sick in the first place! I can write it so that none of them were sick! So that none of them died!”* It didn’t make a lot of sense to me. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I see… 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I tried to talk her down, tried to get her to come out with me, to leave the apartment for a little bit, but she got angry when I suggested that. She kept saying that she was close, that she was almost ready to start ‘*writing it*’. I insisted we go out, but she just shooed me away, telling me that I didn’t understand… telling me that I would. She started getting really agitated before she kicked me out… and no matter what I said, she just wouldn’t listen to me! It was… Ashley was never like that before. She’d never been like that before. It was like I was talking to an entirely different person in there. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Did you try going back for her after she kicked you out?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yes. I called her a few times, I tried to visit her. She never answered my calls or my texts and she kept her door locked from that point forward. She still wasn’t coming to class… she just… she disappeared. The only reason I knew she was still in that apartment was because I heard that music every time I tried to see her. And every time it just got worse… more unnerving. The last time I visited her… I actually wound up vomiting in the elevator on the way out.

&#x200B;

**Young:** It was that bad?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** It was. 

&#x200B;

**Young:** That encounter two weeks after her fathers death, was that the last time you saw Ashley before the incident?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yes. It was.

&#x200B;

**Young:** How much do you know about what happened?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Not much. Only what I heard through the grapevine. I know that the official cause was said to be a gas leak, but… I heard people talking about what they saw in there. And I heard about Ashley… although I never could have imagined the state that she was in.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Eliza, for the sake of the record, can you walk us through what you know about the incident?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** I guess? I… I can’t say I know much, though.

&#x200B;

**Young:** Please, just walk us through it.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Okay. Well… like I said, I heard the official cause was supposed to be a gas leak. 14 people in Ashley’s building turned up dead, most of them on her floor. But one of my classmates was dating one of the cops who was on the scene. She told me that they’d lied about the real causes of death. Or… maybe not lied but… jumped to a false conclusion, I guess? To try and make sense of it all? I don’t know… either way, she said that in each case, all 14 victims had died by suicide. Usually via hanging or asphyxiation, although a few had gone to more gruesome ends to take their own lives. That wasn’t the weird part, though.

&#x200B;

**Young:** What was the weird part?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** You already know, don’t you?

&#x200B;

**Young:** I do. But I need this to be on the record.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Right… right… 

&#x200B;

*\[Pause\]*

&#x200B;

**Hart:** The… um… in each case the bodies had been… been skinned. Completely. And their skins were… they were found in Ashley’s apartment. Along with Ashley. I know that the police concluded she hadn’t been behind the killings, she’d just… she’d done what she did after they were dead, but still… Jesus…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Eliza, are you aware of what Ashley did with the skins?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yes… yes, I am…

&#x200B;

**Young:** For the record, please. I know this is difficult, so please take your time if you need to.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** She had… she’d carved some kind of musical score onto them… I didn’t want to believe it at first, but… when I saw her after the incident. When I visited her in the psychiatric hospital and saw what she’d done to herself… she more or less confirmed it…

&#x200B;

**Young:** You visited her?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Yes… the day after the incident… she… she was agitated. Kept begging to be allowed to go back to her piano. She kept begging to be allowed to continue her work. She said that her message wasn’t done yet. I barely even recognized her… she was covered in scars. She’d carved them into her own skin… it was like sheet music. She’d… she’d carved it into her own skin. She barely even looked human anymore at that point. I… I tried to ask her why… she just said that she’d… she’d ‘*run out of skin*’. 

&#x200B;

*\[Pause. Eliza Hart can be heard breathing heavily in the audio, apparently struggling to hold back tears.\]*

&#x200B;

**Young:** It’s alright… thank you, Eliza… I know that was hard for you. 

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Y-yeah… yeah…

&#x200B;

**Young:** Have you visited Ashley since then?

&#x200B;

**Hart:** No I… I can’t… I want to but I… I can’t… I can’t see her like this anymore… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** I understand.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Am… am I done now?

&#x200B;

**Young:** Yes, I’ve got everything I need, thank you. You did fantastic.

&#x200B;

**Hart:** Thank you… 

&#x200B;

**Young:** Here, I’ll get you a coffee, alright? Or would you prefer tea? Hot chocolate? Let me just turn off the -
