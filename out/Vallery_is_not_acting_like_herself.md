A dear friend of mine from college, whom I work with… well, used to work with, I guess, had weirdly invited me to meet her at a park close to where we live. It was almost 11 a.m. when she sent me this message: 

“I need to tell you something. Meet me in the park by the lake.” 

She didn’t say “good morning” or ask how I was doing, which she always did. And I should’ve suspected something then. I see now how weird it was. 

I groomed myself as best I could, worried. I went outdoors, walked into the park, and sat by the lake, looking around, searching for her. After a few minutes of waiting, I grabbed my phone to message her, but right at that moment, she sat abruptly beside me on the bench, saying a faint “hey.” I answered with a concerned look on my face, questioning what was going on, what that message was about. But I solemnly regret asking. And she started. 

“I don’t know if you know, but there are a few types of lingering souls. When you die and you can’t move on to the next steps of the afterlife, you attach to an echo. This echo is defined by the last emotion you were feeling at that final moment. And if it’s painful, then it’ll be this forever, never moving on, just lingering in an empty world, just like this one, but cold and colorless…” 

“Vallery, where are you going with this?” I asked, getting confused. 

“It’ll make sense, trust me.” And she went on, “If time passes, and you still haven’t moved on, you start forgetting things, like where you lived, the names of the people you used to live with, their faces. Then you start forgetting about who you are. The concept of ‘you’ stops making sense. And you become something else. As I was saying, there are types of lingering souls. 

To mention a few, there’s a banshee, a woman attached to her endless sorrow who attacks anyone who reminds her of the cause of her pain. There are the touchers, which attach to vices like alcohol, drugs, and gambling, causing depression in the living who they’re touching. There are tricksters, which are playful, like to scare, but don’t really affect you. And there are a few who linger for a long time. In that long time in this empty world, it gets smart. It learns how to interact with the material world—how to use energy, how to suck it from the living.” 

“You’re scaring me, Val.” 

“Two weeks ago… that night we went to the bar and Roger was pissed at his boss for another silly thing. Remember? That night, I went back home with him. We kissed good night by my building’s gate, and he went home. I was wasted, you saw it. Tired and only craving a hot shower and my bed, I got into the building. In the hall, I saw a strange figure of a man, looking like the gatekeeper. But he was in a corner, like he was trying to hide, covering his legs and head with his coat. I saw his eyes looking at me and I said ‘good night,’ a little scared. 

I got into my apartment and went straight to the shower. When I got out, I heard the TV on. Then I saw Roger sleeping on the couch. I covered him with a blanket and went to sleep in my room. The next morning he was already gone, as usual, because he works early. My dog Donny barked gently to call my attention, her chin laying on the edge of the bed. That familiar cute bark made me come back to a comfortable reality. We had breakfast, I walked with her, and went on with my day. When work was done, I went to the cafe where I usually meet Roger. He had asked for my usual drink, and when he saw me his smile welcomed me before his arms. He took my bag and hanged it on the chair next to him. He was ever so kind to me.” 

 
I couldn’t help but notice that she smiled a different smile, like when doing something mischievous. Her eyes facing the ground, no wrinkles. The way she went on with this monologue like she had memorized the night before. This wasn’t like her at all. 

“We talked as we always do, laughed, complained, ate a little, and then we went to my place to watch Avengers and whatnot. We had gone to bed. He cuddled me, bringing that home-like feeling—the comfort of knowing exactly how to fit together. And we fell asleep. In the middle of the night though, he got up to go to the bathroom like he always does. I felt him coming back to bed and spooning me. He was a little stiff, crude, and said, ‘Come over here, baby,’ calling me closer. I didn’t notice the time or the flush of the toilet. But I did notice when he came back to bed. Again. 

I woke up the next morning to my first alarm at 6:30 a.m. and heard the shower running. So I gave Roger some privacy and made us some breakfast. After I was done cooking and setting the table, I worried he was taking too long of a shower. He usually takes minutes, especially since he has to leave for work in 30 minutes. So I decided to go call him. But as I opened the door, the sound of the running shower stopped. The lights were off. There was no steam, which always had been there in his extra-hot showers. There was no water running, Eleanor. 

I heard it, I swear I did. Even his movements and the water falling on the ground with inconsistent rhythms! I fucking heard him sing, Eleanor!” I could see the shock in her face, but barely recognizing as her face changed expressions, stiff. Like she couldn’t let go of that grim smile. 
 
“What the hell?” I could understand her acting like this, I couldn’t blame her at all. “What do you think that was?” I asked, getting more worried by each phrase she said. 

“I thought I was hallucinating or something. I walked Donny and went to work. After that, I went straight back to my apartment, tired, like I hadn’t slept at all. So I got to bed earlier that night. But in the middle of the night, again, I woke up for no reason. In that state between being still asleep and waking up, my consciousness still trying to get back to my body, my eyes were driven. Like something was calling my eyes to look a certain way. And I looked. 

You know, every night I close the door and use Donny’s bed as a doorstop, so I feel safe. And I saw her and her bed a little far from where it usually goes. And Donny, my dog, was looking straight at me. I could see the glow of one eye. I could also see, by the height of her eyes but far to the right by my window, a faint light that slowly moved until it matched Donny’s glowing eyes, now a pair. Then… it got up. I saw what appeared to be my dog getting up like a human and standing straight on two legs until it had the perfect silhouette of a tall man. 

And I woke up the next morning. The door was open. My heart was racing. I couldn’t remember fainting. I grabbed my things and ran to work, only trying to figure out what the fuck that was. I told everything to Roger when I got to see him. He told me to get Donny and spend the night at his place. So we did. He mentioned he had a friend that worked with a different kind of religion. The next day, conveniently, they were having a meeting, to which we went. Apparently, we got there early. We saw the people there smoking up the place, singing in a language we couldn’t understand, and lightly playing drums. His friend told us that people there would give their body to trusted entities to help and advise the living. And that’s what I asked for. 

They gave me a small glass pot filled with palo santo grains, coarse salt, and salvia. They asked me to leave it open when we encountered it and to close it in the morning. For seven days. Then to deliver the pot to them. We went back home, talking about how we were already discussing the possibility of living together. 

That night, we were ready. We knew what to do. We went to sleep. Roger got up to go to the bathroom like he usually does. And that’s when I slightly woke up. Then I felt something fall really hard behind me and instantly hug me and restrain my movements. I panicked and the only thing I thought of was to attack it with my shoulder. But when my arm was close to hitting it, I hit the pillow and saw Roger looking at me from the bathroom door. He was looking at me in shock. He hugged me, and I was relieved to feel his warmth. He told me I had gotten up with him and we were kind of having a conversation about how ‘you were better than her’… ‘her’ meaning me. 

We couldn’t get back to sleep that night. All the lights were on. The glass jar was open in front of us. And it was completely silent. It was 2 a.m. when we stopped talking. I was petting Donny and Roger was sitting beside me on the couch. It was in a literal blink of an eye and the room was already covered by sunlight. Donny was sleeping on my lap. Roger was no longer there. I looked at the clock and it was 7 a.m. already, my time to get up and start my day. Roger had made me breakfast and left a note saying, ‘I had to leave early, but I made you this. Hope it helps you have a better day.’ His handwriting was off, like, a little shaky. 

The day went normally, strangely. I got home, we had dinner. Concerned. We went to sleep. Worried. On edge, like going to sleep was a mistake. But eventually, we did, out of tiredness or whatever. And as what should be normal by then, I woke up in the middle of the night. I could almost see, in the dark, the shape of a body, crawling, slowly. The open window would let the light of the moon enter. And like a shower, that thing in slow motion revealed its face in the pale light, little by little, showing me my own face. I was seeing myself. It was mimicking me. And I blacked out. 

We woke up the next morning and without much choice, we went on with our lives. But that day at work, I got a call from my sister telling me to get to the hospital as fast as possible because our mother had had a stroke. When I got there, my father had already left, the nurse said. My mom was sleeping, and I couldn’t do much but cry on her lap. 

We decided to get a hotel room. Roger said he would pack our things and get Donny to the hotel before picking me up at the hospital. A little late, he got there and silently drove us to the hotel, the only thing you could hear in the car was me sobbing. An awkward silence has settled between us three. An unnormal silence, one that Roger wouldn’t normally let happen. But I guess with all the stress we were going through, I didn’t mind.” 


“That night would be the third of seven. And only the fucking beginning. As we were about to fall asleep, we heard someone knock at the door. It was a common knock at first. As I got up, the knocking got more violent. Now banging, they started screaming my name and ordering me to open the door… with Roger’s voice. Burning with rage, I grabbed his pocketknife and opened the door, only to find an empty hallway. And Roger, in a rude tone, said, ‘Now, did you let it in?’. 

The next day I was a pile of stress. At work, my mind would run from ‘what the fuck’ to ‘what should we do,’ from Donny to my mother. Then I decided to call my sister. When I asked about Mom, she could only pronounce the most stupid thing: ‘Our mother is not hospitalized.’ I hung up the call and instantly started dialing the hospital number. And they said the same thing. 

I couldn’t believe in anything anymore. 

It was sunny in the morning. Our stuff was already packed by Roger before leaving for work. The hotel room was quiet. Only me and Donny. 

So, moving from place to place wasn’t working. We decided to go back to our places. And all I could do was wait for that thing and open the jar and wait for the seventh night. Today would be the fourth. And I felt like I was completely losing my mind. I wouldn’t remember going to work or walking Donny. Nor did I remember how we got home with Roger. But I was happy to be with him. 

That night, at the same time, I woke up to Donny’s cry. I sat on the bed, trying to get a better look at her. She was sitting by the open door, which should have been shut. I called her, and then I heard something else. The sound of her silent and cute growling, like when she smelled beef while I gave her her food. From the living room, I could hear her getting up and her nails on the hardwood floor, getting closer. Until I could see Donny getting through the door frame. And side by side, the two Donnys sat, looking at me. Her once cute growling now sounded like a threat. And I woke up, again, as if I had blacked out. I was so scared, but also… getting used to it. That’s how the fourth night went by. 

The fifth day was gone like a snap of the fingers. And I could only remember sitting next to Roger on the couch and, as if I gained consciousness mid-phrase, he was saying, ‘…nally, this should be the last night.’ He had a lit cigar between his fingers, his head down, held by his hands. He sounded sad, but I could see at the side of his face, the wrinkles of a smile. But I couldn’t confirm it. ‘What do you mean? This is the fifth night. There are two more to go.’ He looked at me like I had offended him somehow. 

‘No, Val, this is the seventh night.’ I was shocked but not surprised, if that makes sense. ‘Is that thing affecting your memory?’ I wasn’t sure. Because I was also feeling like this memory loss was a defense mechanism that I just let happen. I didn’t consider the fact that that thing could do this. I thought that when it was over, it would stop too. Maybe I had guessed wrong.” 

“This doesn’t make any sense, Val.” Was the only thing that could come out of my mouth. “Val why didn’t you called me before? You’re in clear danger, we must do something about this!” I claimed, but worthlessly. I was in complete shock barely believing in what I was listening to. And what was worse, I clearly didn’t know what to do to help her. I wanted to find an answer right there at that moment, but I couldn’t stop listening too. 

“It wasn’t hard to sleep, though. I was so exhausted. But even that tired, I woke up in the middle of the night. Roger was snoring slowly. Then Donny made that little ‘barf’ sound when she wants my attention. By the foot of the bed, she was laying her chin, her eyes open wide and glowing faintly. I called her to climb into bed with us. But she answered from the door, crying. I looked at both my dogs. This again. I searched for the glass pot by the nightstand to open it. But what followed Donny at the door had shut my body still. Roger was looking at me, calling my name with a breathless, high-pitched voice. He had never spoken like this, but I couldn’t recognize it was his voice. Then a single hand with fingers slowly made its way, holding the door frame, to reveal the face of my sister. The Donny by the bed started growling aggressively. Behind my sister, my mom. Then my dad. 

I panicked. I panicked real hard, Eleanor. I could only remember running in the streets. I don’t remember how I got out of that apartment or the clothes I was wearing. When I finally stopped to catch my breath, I found myself here, behind the concrete elephant slider near the fence surrounded by bushes. 

I was breathing heavily. I didn’t even have time to think properly when I heard something in the bush to the right. 

Come with me.” 

Val stood up and started walking toward the elephant slider without checking if I was actually following her, but I did. She stood still, pointing at the bush she was telling me about.  

“That’s where I saw it. A pair of white and red Nike sneakers. Dirty. Big. Like my boyfriend’s. I got up to see, only to find him decomposing, Donny next to him filled with larvae. They had been there for a while for the decomposing to be at that stage. Was it really him that night when he fell asleep on the couch? The glass jar given to us, in Roger’s mouth. I puked what I had to puke. I sat again against the slider, and then I heard ‘Shhsh,’ hissing behind the iron fence. Holding two bars and putting its face between them. Again, ‘Shhsh.’ It was me. It was using my face. My voice. 

That, Eleanor, happened last night.” 

I stood quietly. Suddenly, that concept of horror movies being less scary when we watch them while the sun was up wasn’t effective anymore. I was paralyzed in complete silence, looking at an empty shell of Vallery. 

She turned to look at me and said, “She was so scared, Eleanor.” I couldn’t recognize her face. I mean, I knew it was her, her eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks and hair. But there was something in her face that I couldn’t understand. Like something unhuman. It seemed like melting, like her face was disappearing while... a huge grim smile, a smile no one could ever do. Almost reaching her eyebrows. And she walked towards me.
