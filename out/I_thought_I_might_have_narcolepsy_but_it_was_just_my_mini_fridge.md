A few years ago my mother gave me a Coca Cola can mini fridge (it looked like a coke can) she usually had it plugged into her car, but since she stopped going out she gave it to me. It was a good size, had 2 trays and a pocket on the door, if you took the drawers out you can fit a proper sized bottle. I kept it in the basement where I have a small art workshop. I paint with watercolours, use markers and all sorts or other art mediums. I also had a small tv in there that I could stream shows! I would keep drinks and things in the mini fridge for when I’m working in the basement.

Soon after getting the mini fridge I started to black out. It would happen all the time, only for around 5-20 minutes at a time, but I would wake up in weird places really confused. One time I had apparently fallen out of my chair while sleeping which didn’t even wake me up. It was a regular occurrence happening several times a day. I decided to go to the doctor to run some tests, thinking I had narcolepsy or something. For those of you that don’t know what that is, it’s a condition where you fall asleep all the time, having blackouts which could be dangerous if your outside and you pass out in the middle of driving or even just walking around. You could easily get hurt if you fall the wrong way or on something hard. People with narcolepsy need people to watch them and watch out for their blackouts so that they can catch them or stop them from falling during a blackout.
 The doctors ran some tests on me including a CAT scan or MRI (I can’t remember which one.) Narcolepsy is usually cause by an issue in the brain which is why al those tests needed to be done. It turned out I didn’t have any issues so they didn’t know what was causing my blackouts. I would only happened when I was at home in my little basement studio. 

A few months after the blackouts started happening, our basement flooded. As we had a laundry room right next door with a drain in the floor we just moved as much water as we could into the laundry room. The water only went just a bit above our ancles meaning nothing that was off the ground was damaged, but things like cardboard storage boxes we had down there as well as the mini fridge that was sitting on the floor got damaged. The mini fridge shorted out and stopped working after that. After the flood, I stopped passing out, but I soon figured out why. The mini fridge was constantly making a low humming noice that just so happened to be in-tune with my body or something, and that frequency caused me to pass out, once the fridge was broken I was fine so what other explanation was there?
