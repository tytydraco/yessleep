Growing up, I never truly believed in the concept of cryptids or anything I couldn’t explain or understand, it always seemed unrealistic to me, but as I’ve become older I’ve experienced things that don’t have a logical explanation.

For context, I live in a rural area consisting of mostly woods that surround my home, with my closest neighbor being about a half a mile away. I’m also really into hunting with my son and my neighbors, but on this particular day, I was alone.

At around 5 pm, I headed out the back door into the large wooded forest that stretched for miles and miles, just to do some light hunting and trail marking, when I came across a mutilated raccoon limply hanging off of a tree limb. At the time, I just assumed that a bear or a coyote attacked it, but I did find it strange how it was slung around the branch. Throughout the rest of my hike, I didn’t see any more mutilated animal corpses which was nice considering I planned on eating dinner when I got back. After some trail marking, I headed back into my house and decided to invite my neighbors over.

“Pretty weird shit dude” my neighbor Tim told me. “How does a bear or coyote nearly hang up a raccoon corpse like a fucking polo?” Truth be told, it was odd the way it was positioned, but I didn’t think much of it up until he mentioned how odd it was. “Can I come with you tomorrow to check out more of the woods?” Tim asked me. I told him that he could, and we decided to meet up for 4 pm. 

As me and Tim headed out to the woods, we decided to go farther than usual to get some more trails marked, but I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched the entire time,  until me and Tim saw something that made our blood run cold. Hanging from a tree, was a mutilated corpse of what looked like a man. Tim screamed, and I grabbed my phone to dial 911.

When officers arrived onto the scene, we both were questioned about any suspicious activity in the area, but I explained how I haven’t seen anyone on my property and Tim hadn’t seen anybody either.

Police chalked it up to a suicide, where the man must have snuck onto the property to go hang himself, but it was unsettling since I’m almost always home, and I have cameras around the property. 

One night, I woke up out of a dead sleep, sweating in my bed. I looked out my bedroom window, which faces the backyard and the edge of the woods, when I saw something that made the room go cold.

Standing at the edge of the woods, was a figure with unnaturally long limbs, no hair, and milky white eyes.

Staring right at my window.

I wasted no time calling the police, making sure not to break eye contact with the figure until the squad car pulled up. When the police got out, they surveyed the yard, but the figure was nowhere to be found. 

For safety measures, the police advised me to stay with my neighbor Tim, while a more thorough search of the property was conducted. After explaining the story to Tim, we set up a trail cam at the edge of the woods to collect footage over the next few days.

The trail cam picked up the figure, but this time there were multiple, all lurking in the trees. Tim looked terrified, and for as long as I’ve known him, I’ve never seen him look so scared.

The next night at Tim’s house, I woke up to find him gone. I searched the whole house, then fearing the worst, I checked the window.

There, at the edge of the tree-line, was Tim’s lifeless corpse, hanging from a tree with about 5 figures all with the same milky eyes and long limbs. Staring right at the window I was facing out of.

After police were called, officers advised me to leave the area completely, and to move in with a family member for my mental well-being.

Now I live with my sister Sarah, and I see a trauma counselor regularly, I’m doing alright now, but I still think about those incidents a lot.

Hang on, Sarah’s calling

Weird, she’s saying somethings in the backyard, probably just an animal.
