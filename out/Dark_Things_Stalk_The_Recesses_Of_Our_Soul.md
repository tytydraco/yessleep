I have to write this down. Before I can’t. Before the hand of madness grasps at me once more. Before the light of my soul flickers out. Before the sun sets with banal finality and all I know is nothing but shadows upon the valley. All human lives are like that, a race towards our end and the scramble to claw at the soil and clay. Hoping to leave something recognizable to those who come after. I’ve chosen to walk the short and narrow path, and as my time winds down I want nothing more than to leave a warning.

Fear the spaces that don’t exist, the recess within the corners of your mind can house horrors best left unperturbed. Even now what I unearthed stalks my every step and runs a bladed tongue along my skull, lapping at the agony it brings me, a quick death is my only solace.

I think it all started with my grandfather and the night he beat my uncle to death with his bare hands in a drunken rage. My father, his youngest child, bore witness. He never talked about it but even now the vision of him is vivid and visceral. Frail, long-limbed, face tear-streaked as he tried to throw himself over the corpse of his older brother.

In the moments before grandfather could shift his rage towards my dad the top half of his head was eviscerated. And in the moment after the blood and grey matter rain settled he saw his mother standing there, family shotgun in hand. She wouldn’t live another 30 minutes. Maybe it was miscommunication, maybe it was a spontaneous suicide. When the police arrived she emerged shotgun in hand and was dead and bullet-ridden by the time she hit the ground.

Only then did my dad's oldest brother emerge from the crawl space he’d been hiding in. One look, no words, separate cars; that was the last time they’d see each other for 20 years. Different foster homes. Only after my dad married and had me did he put the effort into tracking down my uncle.

Uncle Kev didn’t want to be found and had lived in a corner cramped and inundated with anguish. The moment they reunited my father held nothing but contempt for him. But I didn’t, I think it’s our proximity to our fathers that spells doom. You can see all his failings, and resentment grows in the gaps left by them.

Kev had those gaps too, but with the slight distance that existed between us, I didn’t notice them until much later. He was the cool uncle who was lax and worldly. An anecdote or insight always hid behind that smile of his. He’d been to prison a few times and his heart even gave out momentarily. Back then I thought it was something to be impressed by. Foolish are the youthful in their idealizations.

“Ours is an exquisite loneliness,” he would say and its meaning was lost on me.

He hungered for a space that didn’t exist. He could never unfurl and let the limbs of his being relax. Stuffed into the box of his reality he knew nothing but an omnipresent claustrophobia. So he sought to create space in the only way he knew, in whatever substance he could consume. Even if only illusory when a man has known nothing but thirst he still drinks from the mirage before him. And sometimes, in a fleeting instance, he is satiated.

“It’s there for everyone you know. The things that lull us into their arms with promises of absolution. Some of us can just hear its song a little more clearly. I used to think they were outsiders, but now… I think they’re us.” He told me once, in a moment of shattered stupor.

I knew it was important, maybe the most important thing he would ever say to me. But I couldn’t, and wouldn’t get anything on its meaning from him.

The last time I saw him alive was when I was 19. I’d fallen asleep on his couch and stirred to the sound of the front door opening. I could tell he was on something through his gait alone. He turned to face me, moonlight cast upon his weary visage, and said he was only going out for a pack of smokes. They found his body in the afternoon, drowned in a local creek. Dad didn’t want to identify him so it was left to me. I saw in the wide-eyed stare and gaping maw that he went with fear and the reverence I felt for him drained in an instant.

It’s often said that boys take after their uncles and that held true. I was walking through an echo of a path my uncle had carved out for himself. I’m sure it tore my dad apart but he was never the type to console and I wasn’t the type to plead. So without a word, we split off from each other and never spoke again.

Claire was supposed to be nothing more than a drunken bar hook-up. but she quite never left the morning after and instead would drift in and out of my shitty apartment for a few weeks until one day she just stayed. Broken people are like that, lining up their parts and hoping that they’ll fit and seal the emptiness within them. They don’t and we didn’t. It was a cycle. We’d fight, we’d fuck, and we’d fight again. Reconciliation was never an option because we never had anything to reconcile, it started bad and only ever got worse.

And then one day she was gone. A spontaneous grief-filled departure just like Uncle Kev and wholly different at the same time. She didn’t die, no we’d fought vehemently until she stormed off. I didn’t see her for a week and I filled that gap with drugs and drinks until the time melted away and once again I was roused from my stupor with an open door—a cold gust of wind, moonlight on flesh, and an unexpected goodbye. I was sprawled on the floor and she towered above me as she flicked on the light.

Mania was in her eyes, but not madness. Confidence, a knowing brought on by true clarity. Religious fervor but not through scripture or church.

“I found God, and through him, myself. I wanted to leave you behind, it’s not my place or obligation to preach to you the depths of salvation. But I want to be reborn, start anew with nothing to bind me to the past. I deserve that at least. Goodbye, Alex. We won’t meet again.” and with that, she walked off into the night.

A wave of sobriety washed over me and I crawled toward the open door on hands and knees.

“Claire, wait! Just fucking wait. Claire… Please!” I called out but only my echo answered back.

I understood the exquisite loneliness Uncle Kev had talked about then, and knew his pain. The world folded and shrank around me until the craving for something more, something beyond me overwhelmed all sense. I think I felt the call, the song he had talked about. A tinge in my mind, a realization of a failing within myself, a stalking dark presence.

It sent me down a spiraling path, tumbling towards desolation until some months later I found myself in the dark forest. Dante started his dive and eventual rise through heaven and hell here and figured it was my turn. My body ached, I had no idea how I’d gotten here, the drugs made sure that lucidity was a rarity. Now I loathed it, I’d have to scramble through the ill-lit night toward civilization. I stumbled around for God knows how long, all I knew was that every passing minute brought with it a deepening desperation. Eventually, I came to rest upon a tree trunk and in that moment I did something I had never done before. I prayed, I reached out toward divinity and asked for its guidance. And something answered. I felt a pinprick of sensation blossom within me, at the base of my skull. A radiant warmth filled my body and for a moment my senses heightened to their limits and the world felt… hyperreal. I have no other way of explaining it, the answers I had been searching for seemed within arms reach. And then it spoke.

“Let me in,” it said without words, it was something I felt at the core of my being.

I looked into my mind then, the visual form it took for me had always been an empty black void that I filled in actively. Now I saw that it was a black box and it had corners and boundaries. But they were nothing but chalk outlines and beyond them a space I had never known but had always longed for. Reaching out to it I said, “Take me.”

A lobotomy is an antiquated procedure where a metal spike is driven through the skull into the prefrontal lobe to scramble it to mush. It was meant to leave you addled and lifeless. I didn’t need a lobotomy to know that I and everyone else had been scrambling my head this entire time and now a procedure was taking place that sought to undo the damage and more. A beam of searing heat shot through the back of my skull, angled towards my prefrontal lobe and through the corner of my eye.

The spaces my uncle had longed for his entire life, and the salvation Claire had found, revealed themselves to me. The dark forest was illuminated by light human eyes had never seen and the glow was iridescent and variable. Amalgams of color stained trees and soil and sounds of life unseen assaulted me from every angle. I was taken aback by sensory overload but the breath I let out was one of relief.

The held breath that came in the moments after was one of terror. Something that I could only interpret as a jagged tongue licked the inside of my skull and scraped away some fortitude and for the briefest of instances, my thoughts and actions were not my own. I was cast into an ocean of black sludge and from the bleary surface, I saw it take hold of my body and relish the control it now had. Opportunistic predators rose from the depths towards me, without seeing them I knew their form. Bladed, tendriled, sleek, and serpentine, aching to sink tooth and claw deep into my flesh.

Driven by sheer panic I kicked against the dredge and rose to greet the surface in the moments before I was torn asunder by the things that lurked in the depths of my mind. Breaking through into the forest once more, the dark god that had beguiled me was cast back into the recesses of my mind.

“No,” I said to myself in a half-whisper. In the seconds I spent in that thing’s prison I had clarity and I knew what it was and its intention.

It wasn’t a divine being from the recess of existence. It had been a malignant tumor left to fester and grow to fill the gaps in my being that had only widened these long years. Kev had succumbed to his failings before he had been overtaken by it while Claire had bested them. But I… I had just surrendered myself to it. In the ways I fed it with my resentment and longing it now fed me with its hate and the strength bestowed upon me was for its own ends. In the vignettes of its thoughts, I saw the harm it sought to wreak. The flesh and blood it craved and the cruel ways it planned to sunder all that it came across.

I ran and screamed when I felt its tongue scrape away at my constitution. The slow savor of my horror as it chipped away at the barrier of our separation. Only once since it took control of me. 14 minutes was all it needed for it to end the lives of two people. I watched screaming from the dark oceans as my demons plunged into the flesh of my soul and ripped away whole chunks to devour. The dark god did the same with its bare hands and I could only watch as it crushed bone and tore sinew until I was able to surface once more and regain myself. Broken, but whole enough to continue forward, for a while longer, as I always did.

I’ve fled since and holed myself up in a dingy shed left to rot in the woods. I wrote this out to be posted as a confessional warning of the things we house in our minds and the spaces that don’t exist yet guide so much of ourselves. Of the danger of submitting to the things that lurk in the dark recesses of our minds and the malaise that leads us to decadence and decay.

Even now as I finish typing this I feel its tongue press against me, enough has been stripped away that it won’t be much longer before it takes hold once more. A cliffside resides only a few minutes away, it overlooks the coast and is surrounded by jagged rock. It’ll be a race but I know that at the very least I’ll be halfway to greeting them before it takes me once more. And in that, I’ve found that elusive solace I’ve been looking [for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimoireofmadness/)
