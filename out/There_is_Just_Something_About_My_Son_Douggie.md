Douggie was always an unusual boy—he had a lot of his father in him, something I resented every time I laid eyes on him. A 43-year-old man-child, still not the perfect young gentleman I had envisioned him to be. I am sure that as I make chili, he is making love to his sock. Douggie has always attended to his urges—a little too much for my liking. Just like my man-whore of an ex-husband.

Since childhood, the only food Douggie would tolerate was chili. I hate chili with a passion. I instantly gag when the scent invades my olfactory nerves. But I am not going to let it go to waste—why should I? Even cheap food is expensive when one has no active income. Might as well feed it to Douggie; maybe then he’ll have something else to focus on besides his filthy urges.

It’s the only way I can control my idiotic son. Something so simple yet potent. I never understood his obsession with my chili, but it gets the job done. As usual, I have to call Douggie down from his room.

I am sure he is having the time of his life with camgirls. The only way I ever get his attention is through humiliation, so I yell at the top of my lungs, “Douggie! Your chili is on the table! Quit watching that porn and get your ass in here, pronto!”

Just another failure to add to the long list of disappointments that is my son—like his father in every single way. I should have poisoned his precious chili years ago, but even though Douggie is a deplorable waste of life, he is still my son. I could not resort to such extreme action. For some reason, I’ve always held onto the hope that he would be more like me than his father. That Douggie would turn his life around and treat me with dignity and respect, like the delicate flower and queen that I am.

Before I could even summon him, Douggie had already taken his seat—an unusual undertaking for him. He sat at the table, eyes fixed on the bowl of chili. Disgusting. He was foaming at the mouth as if he were a starving child. He looked like a caveman, grabbing his spoon, his hands trembling in anticipation.

The way he stuffed his mouth with chili—practically gargling the liquid, swishing it around as if it were mouthwash. Pieces of beans stuck between his teeth as he gave me his typical idiotic smile. God, I can’t stand the sight of him, watching him eat like a barbarian. But I force a smile, always pretending to approve of this uncivilized behavior.

After all the sacrifices I have made for him—providing Douggie with every want and need—this is my repayment. A chili-obsessed freak with a compulsive need to attend to his urges. He and his father alike have failed me in every conceivable way.

I am at my limit with this ridiculousness. As always, I praise him for finishing every bite. “Very good, very good, Douggie. You ate every crumb. You’re such a good boy—so close to being the gentleman I always envisioned you to be.” Look at me, speaking to him as if he were a child. He stares at me with admiration, chili spilling from his mouth like a waterfall, dripping down his neck, soaking into his white undershirt, covering his chest hairs in a thick brown river of chili and saliva.

My eyes bore into the sight of my failure of a son. “If you have something to say, Douggie, now is the time.”

Douggie’s demeanor changed. He began hyperventilating and trembling, spitting out the chili he had just swallowed, covering my once-white tablecloth. His eyes bulged from their sockets, and he let out an uncontrollable screech—an ape howling from the depths of his lungs.

He was out of control. All I could do was watch this scene unfold like something from a horror movie.

“Well, Douggie? What is it?”

Douggie seemed to relax. He stared at me, a sinister grin spreading across his face. Then he opened his mouth.

“MaY I hAvE mORE of YouR Special Chili, MoTHER?”

With no other alternative, I smiled—a veil of glee masking my disdain.

“Anything for my young gentleman.”
