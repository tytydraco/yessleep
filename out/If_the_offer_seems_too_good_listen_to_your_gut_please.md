Hey all, I’m not sure why I’m sharing this story. It just shook me to my core and I don’t really have anyone to talk about it with. I’m 29 years old, male, and I just moved to the Northern California area about a month ago. I had a promising job lined up; being poor and without family or friends holding me to my hometown, it was an easy decision to follow the money. Being from a small town in South Dakota, the rent prices here blew me away. I don’t know how you all do it. 


Anyhow, all the following events take place over 2 weeks. 


I spent the first couple days after arriving in the city of Sacramento sleeping in my car with my pet rat (His name is Chester). I spent most of my days wondering whether I was in the Farm to Fork Capital or the City of Trees and searching for housing. Most options for affordable rooms were hiding behind an anxiety producing amount of paperwork, or it was some creep looking for: “someone who would warm up to the idea” of being “cuddling roommates”. I shuddered at the idea of needing to accept that kind of um… “help”. 


On the third night, my luck seemed like it was turning around. A home! Well, a room in a home, but it had heating (which is more than I could say for my clunker of a Subaru) and the rent was only $400 a month flat. I knew there was going to be a catch, I just wish I had known what that trade off would leave me with. I would have never gone to look at the room. 


The Ad read as follows: ROOM FOR RENT:


800 sq ft room, $400/mo, (no utility payments will go to you) and one shared bathroom. 


You’ll have access to a full kitchen, parking in the rear alley and lots of going ons in the surrounding area (bars, music venues, etc.). 


No drugs, drinking, guests or pets. ~


No pictures included. 


The required sobriety and no guests told me that whoever was renting the room was an oddball of some sort, but sleeping in my car another night with some weed shake was still worse. I emailed the poster hoping that Chester wouldn’t be an issue. He’s tiny and never leaves my side. After a nerve wracking hour or so, I got an email back:


“Hey, thanks for your interest. I really don’t like animals, but no one else has reached out. Why don’t you come by this evening and we can chat. 


[ADDRESS REDACTED]


Emailed from my iPhone
Bobby Grant”


I took a couple minutes to do some celebratory fist pumps in my car and held Chester’s hands and had him do a little happy dance. It was fun until I realized someone outside the car was staring at me with a concerned look of curiosity. I quickly stashed my little friend, waved at the stranger and drove off towards my potential new home. 


Pulling up in my car, I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the house was. It was an old Victorian house, with a fun paint job and a lovely front porch staring out at the busy street. I was already imagining spending mornings out there petting Chester and sipping coffee. I walked up and was going to knock on the door, but as I went to, Bobby opened it. 


Bobby stood much taller than me and he looked down on me with very empty eyes. He was probably at least 6’4” with a barrel chest and cannons for arms. His stern face was covered in a thick beard, that only made him look less welcoming. 


The one thing that threw me for a loop was his hair. Wavy locks of auburn hair fell just below his chest. I was kind of stunned honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a woman with hair so glamorous. 


I noticed I had been staring at him and he looked like his patience was running thin. 


“OH” I yelped, caught off guard “sorry you scared me a little bit!”


“Weird, okay” Bobby flatly replied. 


This first impression was starting off just great. 


“Hey, this house is gorgeous you’re a lucky guy being able to live here” I tried to get off on a better foot and not screw up my only chance for a warm night indoors. 


“Luck huh?” Bobby snorted “My grandpa bought this home 30 years ago when it was in shambles. I helped him restore it as a young man and when he died he left it to me. I earned this home.”


“Oh-yea-…I just meant uh” I hated this. Being stuck in a one-on-one with someone who seemed to ignore all the unwritten rules of pleasant conversation. It didn’t help how much he towered over me too. I just wanted to seem submissive and agreeable, it’s what he seemed to want and I had no room to argue. “I just meant that it’s a really amazing home, you and your grandpa must have been as close as you both are talente-“


“Just stop.” Bobby cut me off “You seem fine, I’ve been told I come off cold. It’s just me. Relax okay?”


I internally sighed, grateful. He might still be an asshole, but at least I know it’s not personal I guess. I thanked him for saying as much and he invited me in. 


We sat down in the living room, he poured us some tea and we talked for an hour or so. I spared him hearing details about my personal life, I figured he wasn’t the kind for small talk. He asked about where I had come from, what I was doing for work and what my plans for the future were, just basic screening of a stranger. I understood too as I sat in front of him wearing the same clothes I was wearing two days ago and holding a rat. He initially seemed kind of disgusted when he saw Chester, but as I spoke to him, I would give Chester pets and a cashew or two. I don’t think Bobby loves my little guy like I do, but he seemed more curious than grossed out and that seemed like the best case scenario. 


After I gave my life’s summary, Bobby shared a few details of his life with me. He grew up in the area with his grandparents. Apparently, his mother had left when he was born and his father was either unable or didn’t care enough to raise him alone. I decided it was best to not dig into that. 


Bobby’s grandfather was a fairly successful businessman, apparently owning a large marble quarry in Italy, and moved with his young family to California. Whatever had happened with Bobby’s dad, it had apparently pushed him out of the will, so Bobby got everything. Now he spent his days working out, reading books and building unique carpentry projects. A simple man. I can respect that. 


Then I saw a little bit of life glow in his eyes and he sheepishly said “I’ve actually put a lot of effort into my hair lately.” 


I was so caught off guard. It was like a switch had flipped, he was such a different man than who I spent the last hour talking to. It was even more extreme than that, it was like if you flipped the switch and instead of a light coming on the entire room swapped with another. 


I definitely wasn’t going to miss an opportunity to gas him up though. “Oh man I can tell, it looks really good. What kind of stuff do you use?” He started giving me his routine and I nodded happily not knowing a thing he was talking about. 


My acting seemed to pay off, cause at the end of our conversation Bobby asked when I would like to move in. “I haven’t cleaned the room yet bu-“ I stopped him, “No, no! That’s fine I can clean! Is it okay if I moved in now?” Bobby seemed a little surprised but said that was fine. 

A week passed and things were great actually. I thought that I would be hiding in my room any time I was home, but Bobby and I would chat with each other more and more each day. It still wasn’t a lot and nothing too much more than surface level conversation. I was happy to have someone to talk to anyways. 



One day, as I was getting home from work, a strange man opened our door from the inside as I was reaching for the handle. “Sorry, excuse me” he said curtly as he brushed by me. I walked inside and looked into our living room, Bobby was there sitting on the couch holding a large black pump bottle. “Traveling salesman must have had a good pitch huh?”, I chuckled, “Bobby?” He hadn’t looked up from the bottle. “Bobby? Hello?” He snapped out of his trance, “What? Oh hey.” He looked back down at the bottle. “What have you got there?” I asked, “It’s a new conditioner, product isn’t even on the market, I connected with this guy online.” 


I laughed a little internally, I don’t think I would ever get used to seeing this guy be so obsessive over his hair. “What’s so special about it?” I plucked the bottle from his hand and gave it a quick look over. It didn’t have any brand name that I recognized, but I mostly used Head and Shoulders 2-in-1, so there’s probably a lot of brands I’m unaware of. The only thing I had time to read was “Ad Infinitum” before Bobby aggressively snatched it back. He held it close to his chest and had a look in his eyes that was a mix of anger and worry. I think he realized how it came off, “Sorry” he said “It was pretty expensive and I’m just excited to finally have it.” “How expensive are we talking? 40-50 doll-“ “It was $175” Wow, it was a big bottle but even still that seemed like a lot of money for hair products. I guess Bobby did have a significantly more amount of money than me. )}


One day, I got home from work. I opened the door and Bobby’s head quickly popped out from his room, “Hey! Was there a package for me?” He asked anxiously, “Uh yeah there was” I held up the football sized brown box that was on our porch. “YES” I’d never heard him shout before, I jumped a little. “What’s got you so excited?” I asked as I quickly tossed him the box. He had started running towards me and I thought he wasn’t going to be able to stop if he got too close to me. “It’s a new conditioner I read about.”

I chuckled in my head, no matter how much I got acquainted with Bobby, seeing him get excited about his hair was so amusing. “Well it must be pretty special to get to you like this.” “At $150 a bottle it better be special!” Wow $150 for hair product? I couldn’t imagine spending that kind of money on anything so frivolous, but to be fair I couldn’t imagine having the kind of money Bobby had. 


My job was going well I joined an apprenticeship, pay wasn’t great at the start, but I just had to stick with it and I’d start making more. I’d leave for work around 6:30 in the morning. As I got up on Monday morning I heard water running in the bathroom. “Bobby must be trying out that new product” I thought. 

When I returned home around 4, I heard water still running. “Is Bobby taking another shower?” I wasn’t the most hygienic person but two showers in a day seemed excessive for someone who wasn’t doing too much day to day. Maybe he worked out and was just cleaning off to enjoy the rest of the evening feeling fresh. 

A couple hours passed by, Bobby was still in the shower. I put my ear up to the door and I thought I heard something. It was quiet, but I could’ve sworn I heard Bobby…singing? I didn’t want to be pushy or anything but  I really needed to use the bathroom. I knocked on the door, “Hey, uh, Bobby? Are you gonna be out soon? I gotta use the bathroom man.” Bobby replied very flatly, “I’m not finished” I started feeling desperate, the only thing that could be worse than me being a pest is if I shit my pants in this guys house. “Bobby please I need to-“ I started to jiggle the doorknob. “IM NOT FINISHED” Bobby yelled at me. 

That scared me. It almost scared the- well you get the point. I opted to head to a coffee shop around the corner and use the bathroom there. When I came home, Bobby was still in the shower. I could see steam starting to pour out of the bottom of the door. I began to wonder if this wasn’t a second shower, would he have spent all day in there? I put my ear up to the door again, and this time clearly, but quietly I heard Bobby in a sing-songy voice “Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. 


Maybe he had OCD and opted to not tell me. Even still to spend over 12 hours in a shower seems wild. I ate dinner, went to my room and fell asleep to the white noise of the water running. This was really weird and I was starting to wonder if I made the wrong decision in living here. I almost decided to grab my stuff and head out, but I think it would look bad to head to work with my whole life in my car. 


I went to work the next day, Bobby still  was in the shower. He was singing louder too, not too much but I could hear him without going right up to the door. I didn’t know how I was going to handle this. The rent was so low and at my starting pay, I couldn’t afford to live anywhere else, but if this man is completely unhinged I didn’t know if I was safe there. I tried to focus on my work and not think about whether or not Bobby was still showering. 


When I got home, I froze going to unlock the front door. I had to be losing my mind, but it was so crisp, Bobby was screaming now. “RINSE AND REPEAT. RINSE AND REPEAT. RINSE AND REPEAT.” As I stood at the front door, our neighbor walked up. “Hey man what the fuck is going on in there?” My heart was beating through my chest. “I-I-I don’t know… I’m really worried.” The neighbor looked annoyed “I told him if he lost it again I was calling the fucking cops.” Looking back now, I wish I hadn’t tried to calm him down, . “Don’t do that. Let me try and see what’s going on.” 


I opened the door and started walking towards the bathroom.  Bobby’s screaming rang through the house. There was a feeling in the air too, something screaming just as loud as Bobby telling me to turn and run. I pounded on the bathroom door and nervously yelled “Bobby? H-hey what’s going on man, you’re scaring me! BOBBY!” I wasn’t sure if he was ignoring me or couldn’t hear me shouting over his own singing. 


I decided that I had to do something. While I don’t know what he had done previously to upset the neighbors, clearly Bobby was not in a good spot mentally. I took a couple steps back and lunged forward shoulder first into the bathroom door. 


As soon as I was in the bathroom, I was hit with a wall of steam. Something smelled really weird, kind of metallic and it became strong and thick mixing with the steam. “RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT” Bobby was screaming louder and in faster succession. I went around the small wall that separated the toilet and the shower and I was horrified. “Bo-Bobby?” I looked at the glass wall of the shower and it was covered in blood. “RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT-RINSE-AND-REPEAT.” “BOBBY COME ON MAN WHATS GOING ON?” My hand was slowly reaching toward the door handle. In my head I was telling myself “Stop. Don’t open it. Leave.” But it was like my hand was in auto-pilot. 


When I opened the door, a mixture of water and blood flooded onto the floor. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Bobby was smiling. A twisted smile. Something like if an alien wearing human skin was trying to smile but didn’t get the subtleties and ended up looking a creep. Above Bobby’s sick grin he was scrubbing conditioner into his hair. Except, it wasn’t his hair anymore. He had scratched so hard he had torn the skin on the top of his hair. Flaps of skin draped off the sides of his skull. Flesh and hair had clogged the drain. His fingernails were mostly gone, removed from continuous and furious scratching at his exposed skull. 


I vomited, adding to the noxious mixture of blood, chunks of flesh and water that was pooled on the floor. Bobby looked at me, blood was flowing down his face and into his eyes that were so wide open I could’ve believed he had cut his eyelids off. 


I screamed a primal scream. Something animalistic, a reptilian brain reaction to the horror I was witnessing. Our neighbor appeared in the bathroom, having heard all the commotion. “JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE HELL” Bobby inhaled deeply and let out one more strong “RINSE AND REPEAT” then collapsed in the mess on the floor. 


We called 9-1-1, but Bobby was dead by the time they got there. Loss of blood they said. I didn’t know what had happened, I told everything I did know to the first responders and then they loaded up Bobby and left. I got Chester, some necessary items and left. I could come back for the rest, but I couldn’t be there anymore. Because Bobby was dead there wasn’t much of a way to figure out what had happened. It seemed like he had just snapped and my being there was only bad timing and even worse luck. 


Like I said, I’m not sure exactly why I wanted to share this, but I needed to tell someone. I couldn’t carry it in my head any more. So if you got to the end here, thanks for sharing in my trauma and sorry too I guess. Also if anyone in the Sacramento area has a place for me to live I’d appreciate it. I’m finishing this story at a local gym, I got a membership to be able to use the showers. There was a little bit of the Ad Infinitum leftover, it didn’t seem right to let such expensive stuff go to waste and  Bobby wasn’t going to be using it anymore. Let’s see how pretty my hair can be.
