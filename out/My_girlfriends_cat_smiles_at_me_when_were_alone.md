I’ve been dating Karena for a couple of weeks now. We met on Duet, and honestly, things clicked immediately. I’m a Nursing major at Duquesne in Pittsburgh and she is an English major at Chatham, so we live pretty close to each other. We’ve had a few dinners, caught a couple of movies, and things are going well. She’s smart, funny, and pretty damn cute. 

The only problem is her cat.

Okay, maybe “problem” isn’t the right word. I don’t want to make it sound like I’m being dramatic, but there’s something weird about this cat. His name is Linksy, a little grey-and-white thing with big green eyes. His one eye is a little messed up, like it’s perpetually half-closed, and usually there’s some dried blood around it. Also, his one ear is rock solid, kind of like cauliflower ear in humans, but for a cat. At least that’s what Karena calls it. She said he was named after Link from Zelda, and all of his littermates were named after other Zelda characters. Hylia, Midna, etc.

I met Linksy on my first visit to Karena’s place. He didn’t seem to like me very much. He glared at me like I was an intruder. My first impression of this cat was that he looked pissed off and unimpressed, like the world just annoys him. He also didn’t move around much. He sat perched on the arm of the couch beside us while Karena and I watched El Camino.

About halfway through the movie, right when Karena got up to grab her phone charger, I saw something. Linksy’s face changed. For a moment, his usual angry glare shifted into something else. Something almost… smug? Like a weird, half-smile. I almost laughed, it was so absurd. It wasn’t even a proper smile, more like a little dopey grin. I took out my phone to snap a picture, but just as I opened the camera app, Karena came back into the room, and poof, the expression was gone.

Linksy was back to his usual grumpy self, staring at me like I was an inconvenience.

I really thought nothing of it at first. When I told Karena about it, she laughed. A little too much, if you ask me. She said that Linksy had never done that before, but she still found it funny.

I guess I found it funny, too. It was a weird little moment we had. 

Three days later, I was back at her place, this time to go see Beetlejuice Beetlejuice in theaters. Another fun date. Linksy was on the arm of the couch again, giving me that usual “I don’t like you” look. As I stood there waiting for Karena to grab her purse, I looked over at the cat, and for a second, he was smiling again.

But this time, it wasn’t a little smirk. This was a full-on grin. His eyes were wide open and he was showing most of his teeth. He looked like the fucking Cheshire Cat. It felt like he was in on some kind of joke that only he knew about. Needless to say, this wasn’t as funny as last time. 

I reached for my phone again, but before I could take a picture, Karena came back. I was left standing there with my phone in my hand, wondering if I was losing it.

I reluctantly mentioned my experience to her as we were on the way to the movie. She laughed again, but this time it felt like a nervous laugh, not the easy, carefree one she had before. She told me I was lying, said Linksy had never smiled at anyone. I chuckled with her, but honestly, I felt like I was the punchline of some kind of joke that I wasn’t in on. 

After the movie, Karena invited me back to her place. To be honest, the movie helped me to forget what had happened earlier. We spent the night together, and I won’t go into the details of that part. Let’s just say it was pretty amazing.

I woke up in the middle of the night.

I felt something moving on top of me. At first, I thought it was just Karena, maybe shifting in her sleep, but then I opened my eyes. And there, at the foot of the bed, was Linksy.

The light from the window barely illuminated his shape, but his eyes were wide open. And that grin. That goddamn grin was back. It was even worse than before. All of his teeth were completely in view, his “bad eye” oozing blood as he crept closer. 

I tried to move him off the bed, but as soon as I touched him, he let out a high-pitched yelp. I jerked my hand back, startled, but before I could react, Linksy darted out of the room. I didn’t know what the hell had just happened, but my heart was pounding.

Karena woke up, groggily asking what was going on. I didn’t want to sound crazy, so decided to omit the fact that her cat looked like Satan’s little helper. I just told her that I was trying to move Linksy off the bed. She seemed a bit annoyed that I had upset her cat, but she didn’t press the issue. 

After that, I left. It was already 6:30 AM, and after what had happened, I wasn’t going to get any sleep anyway. I grabbed my stuff and left her apartment without looking back. But as I walked to my car, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me. I didn’t want to look over my shoulder, and so I didn’t. I had already been traumatized enough for the night. 

Those were just the first few interactions I had with that fucking devil-cat. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been back to Karena’s apartment a few times. I try to make excuses to not go over as often as I can, but Karena is insistent. I love her, and so I do it.

I genuinely think that Linksy has made it his mission to mess with me. I’m not even sure why I’m still going along with it. Last month, I was walking up to Karena’s apartment and saw him watching me through her bedroom window. Of course, his grin was wide and unwelcoming. I didn’t feel like sticking around to find out why he was so giddy. I told Karena I wasn’t feeling well and went home. 

Another time, while we were cuddling, Linksy squeezed his way between us and climbed onto my lap. He dug his claws in hard. He wanted to remind me that he was there. I shifted away from Karena in pain. He jumped back onto the arm of the couch and just watched. His eyes never left me.

There’s something intentional about what he does. Is he just trying to mess with my head? Maybe he enjoys watching me squirm. Maybe he’s trying to make me look crazy. I probably am crazy. 

Karena and I have a dinner date planned at her apartment tonight. I think she wants to talk more about moving in together. Should I bring it up with her? Should I keep going along with this? I love her, I really do, but I’m tired of feeling paranoid over a goddamn cat. What do I do?
