I’m tired. I don’t know what to do.

My mind is a smooth thoughtless black sea unbathed in moonlight. My limbs are stiff and cold, like a dead man’s. My eyes are drowning in shadow. Sleep has become a memory and I fear it will soon become something even fainter than that.

It began with the mutt, and it will end with the mutt.

Of that I’m sure, at least.

It is now August but it was in the thundering heart of a hot January storm that we found it standing there in the highway, all wet fur and fleas and ribcage. I wish I had never stepped on the brake pedal. I wish I had run it over, my kids’ trauma be damned.

Who am I kidding?

It was always meant to find us.

  


**1. The night we found it**

Where we live, in Southern Brazil, January is storm season, and every year flash floods and mudslides come ringing the bells of calamity to carry away a few poor souls. It is also summer holiday season for school children, and our kids were driving me and my wife insane.

Our son, Pedro, had recently turned ten, whereas our daughter Julia will be fourteen come October. We had been struggling with entertaining the kids, as this was their first school vacation after we moved from the capital to a small countryside town. It was a decision we made after the pandemic, partly to get away from the violence in the big city, but also to help heal a quarantine-induced mental breakdown which landed me in a psychiatric hospital for six weeks (a story for another time).

Though the house we bought is big and the land around it wild and expansive, full of wondrous discoveries and possibilities for adventure, our children are city-bred and have had a hard time adapting to the country life. So it was that we ended up driving over a hundred kilometers to visit a traveling amusement park of questionable safety credentials and, after a long, long day of lines and rides in the sun, found ourselves on highway BR 277 on our way back home, the children fast asleep on the back seat, me and my wife humming along to old punk rock classics to keep ourselves awake.

It began to rain heavily and I was forced to slow down, annoyed, as there were still many kilometers to cover and my feet ached. The highway became a blur as my Corolla’s wiper struggled to fight off the fat drops of rain that assaulted our windshield like a meteor shower. 

It was then that it appeared — suddenly and out of nowhere, as if it had just entered the world at that very moment, in that precise spot.

Though I am forty two and in the worst shape of my life, my reflexes are still intact, and I slammed the brakes as soon as I saw that strange skeletal silhouette blocking our path. I was afraid we would aquaplane but thankfully the car skidded to a halt, the headlights a mere ten centimeters away from what I could now see was the gaunt outline of a malnourished stray dog.

The children jolted awake. My wife gasped from the sudden fright. I began to honk, afraid a truck might come and slam behind us full force, but the beast refused to move. I backed away slowly and tried to drive around it, but the mutt moved to block our way like a tollhouse awaiting payment. 

Tired and angry and scared, I climbed out of the car into the rain and tried to push the thing with my own hands, but like a stubborn mule, weighing more than its slender frame had any right to weigh, it refused to budge. 

The wind was loud and I could barely hear my wife calling my name and the children begging me to come back inside and just take the stray home with us.

“We are *not* getting a fucking dog,” I barked, knowing the rain would drown out my cursing.

But try as I might I could not get it to leave. Even when I managed to push it out of the road, it would strut back to stand in our way before I could make it back to the car.

“God fucking dammit,” I spat.

“Dad, come back,” my daughter cried, her plea amplified by thunder. “Let’s just take it home. I’ll help you find a shelter, I promise.”

Sighing, I gave up on battling the stubborn mutt. I wrapped my arms around its soaking wet torso and lifted it up in my arms. It was as light as a pile of crumpled newspaper and it surrendered to my embrace as if that was what it wanted all along.

The rain had soaked through my boots and my steps made loud splashing sounds as I dragged the stray towards the car and shoved it in the trunk. 

I drove away as soon as I could. An hour and a half later, we were home.

The first thing we did was give the mutt a bath (right after I took a long shower myself). We soon discovered it was a male, never neutered. Its fur, which at first seemed to be dark brown, began to acquire color as we washed the mud off it, becoming a sort of faded caramel gold speckled with thin splotches of brittle white hairs. The dog was so quiet it almost seemed dead, if not for the shallow breathing that visibly made its ribcage move. It was medium sized—smaller than a Boxer, bigger than a Dachshund.

It was thin, clearly malnourished, and seemed to be starving, and its eyes were moonlit silver—cataracts, though it seemed to be able to see, as it occasionally followed my movements with its strange bestial gaze.

After bathing it we tried to get it as dry as possible and gave it some rice mixed with minced beef, which the mutt refused to touch. It did drink a lot of water, though, and then proceeded to lie down by the large bed I share with my wife. The children, delighted to have a new pet, as their elderly cat barely provides entertainment these days, begged me to let it stay. 

Reluctantly, I agreed, if only so I could finally get some sleep, though I still planned to find a way to get rid of it first thing in the morning.

As my wife and I climbed onto bed, the children kept squabbling over what to call it, deciding each to call it by a different name and see which the dog himself would choose.

“His name is Coragem,” my daughter said.

“No way,” my son replied. “He’s a Carlinhos if I ever saw one.”

To this day no one has been able to land on a definitive name for the thing. But in my mind it has always been nothing more than The Mutt.

Later, when my wife was asleep, I took a Xanax from her purse and finally managed to doze off. I had no dreams that night.

When morning came, the mutt was still there.

And then all sorts of strangeness began.

  


**2. The tragedy of our cat Bonitão**

The dog was—still is, except in dreams—eerily quiet. My son seemed to be fascinated with it. Even my daughter, the one who’d been having the hardest time adapting to our new life, looked a little more cheerful the morning after we found it. Pedro begged me to keep it a little while longer, and against my better judgement I agreed.

I couldn’t see what they saw in it. It is an ugly thing, sickly-looking and strange-eyed. I didn’t like looking at it. Its skin was too taught, its bones too sharp, it’s legs too long — like stilts. It is an eyesore. And it likes to *stare*.

In the afternoon I let it outside and it immediately ran off into the woods. I was glad to see it go and kept hoping it wouldn’t come back, but after a few hours it found its way back to our doorstep. 

I gave up on calling the shelter, at least for a while, as playing outside with the mutt seemed to be doing my boy some good. Every now and then he’d try to follow the stray into the woods, though he always seemed to lose track of it.

The dog ate nothing I offered it. No meat, no expensive dog food. I finally decided to call a vet, who told me the mutt was indeed much thinner than he should be, but otherwise seemed perfectly healthy. 

“He may not be eating what you have to offer”, the vet said, “but he’s definitely eating *something*, alright.”

As to what that *something* may be, I am too terrified to say, though I think I have a pretty good guess now.

Very soon I found myself regretting my decision to postpone calling the local shelter.

The first sign that something was amiss was the sudden behavioral shift of our nineteen-year-old cat Bonitão, blue-eyed and white-furred, still relatively spry despite his age. After laying eyes on the mutt for the first time, he seemingly decided he would never touch the ground again. Instead, he started moving around the house by jumping from object to object, from bookshelf to couch to windowsill, like a child pretending the floor is made of lava. Whenever we tried to get him to come down, he became quite aggressive, and even bit my daughter’s hand and scratched my wife’s arms drawing long lines of blood. I found myself forced to make adjustments to feed Bonitão on the book shelf, lest he starve himself to death.

I began arguing quite rabidly with my wife and children. I told them it was the mutt’s fault, but they didn’t want to hear a word of it. They insisted it was normal cat behavior and that soon Bonitão would get used to the mutt, but no. 

Then Bonitão moved up to the roof, and nothing could get him to come down. Oddly, nobody seemed to care. He’ll come down, they said.

He didn’t.

Twice a day I climbed up there to feed him, and I stayed until he finished eating otherwise the place would be crawling with rats. This lasted for a couple of weeks, and finally ended one rainy morning when I found our nineteen-year-old family cat impaled on our rust-eaten peacock-shaped weather vane. 

I have no idea how it could have happened. It seems unlikely he could land in such a fatal way on his own.

Somehow I knew the mutt was to blame.

My wife and children seemed bizarrely unaffected by the loss. Furious, I questioned them about it. How could they not care?

“Dad,” my daughter said, “Bonitão was nineteen years old. Pets don’t live forever.”

“Yeah, dad,” my son added. “Everybody dies.”

I told them it was the mutt’s fault, that it had scared Bonitão all the way up to the roof, but nobody wanted to hear a word of what I had to say.

  


**3. My wife’s strange remarks**

After burying Bonitão under an orange tree in the orchard, I called the shelter. No vacancies, they said. The new municipal administration had cut the shelter’s budget in half, they said. No way to know when there would be an opening for the mutt, they said.

*Go fuck yourselves*, I said.

My wife and children, having heard my end of the call, cornered me in the kitchen, the mutt following right behind them.

“You can’t send him away, dad,” Julia said. 

“Please,” Pedro begged. “He’s the best thing that’s happened since we moved here.”

“Well?” my wife glared at me. 

“Alright,” I gave up. It was three on one. “But *I’m* not taking care of it. You hear me? It needs a vet, *you* call it. If it’s hungry, *you* feed it. Got it?”

The children shrieked in jubilation. My wife barely smiled at all.

Rosária, my wife of nineteen years, was recently let go and has had some trouble finding a suitable role due to the highly specific nature of her profession. She was prescribed 1.0 milligram Xanax a day to deal with the myriad anxieties of unemployment, but soon after Bonitão died—was *killed*, I mean—she no longer seemed to need her pills. She seemed to have found a new passion in gardening, and she began taking a lot of time caring for a sapling of an unidentified species which had begun to grow in our backyard. 

The mutt seemed to enjoy sunbathing next to her, as I could always find it standing beside her when she was outside, hovering skeletally like a second shadow. 

One day I found her spraying the sapling with some sort of chemical she said would help drive leafcutter ants away. The mutt stood beside her like the third child we never had, watching her hands attentively as she worked.

“What an odd mutt,” I remarked. “It’s peculiarly curious, even for a dog.”

“Don’t be a fool, Fernando,” she said, looking at me like I was a toddler barely blurbing out my words. “He is not a dog.”

“What is it, then?” I asked, thinking this was surely some attempt at a joke. “Sure looks like a dog to me.”

“Really? Tell me, then. What sort of dog breed has nine heads?”

“What?” I could barely believe her words. “Nine heads? What are you talking about?”

“Never mind,” she changed the subject. “You may have two working eyes, my love, but you were always blind as a bat.”

Since that day she has become increasingly distant, obsessed with gardening with the mutt by her side. Her roses kept growing and the sapling became taller and fuller with every passing day. She cares about nothing else. I tried to get her to go back to the psychiatrist, but she tells me I’m the one who’s crazy.

Yeah, right.

Sometimes I think I can hear her speak to it, that awful gaunt mute thing, and whatever language she is speaking, I’ve never heard her speak before. Her tone is playful, joyful, which it never is anymore when she’s talking to me. I’ve even caught glimpses of her laughing to herself, as if the mutt has just told her the funniest joke.

At night, when she thinks I am asleep, I can hear her whisper vile things to me.

“You are not loved”, she murmurs. “You were never loved.” 

She leans closer and I feel her hot rotten breath on my neck.

“You are a horrible father. Your children are disgusted by you. Your wife looks at you and feels nothing but contempt. You are not a man. You are less than a dog. You will not be missed.”

But whenever I open my eyes she pretends to be asleep.

  


**4. My daughter’s dark journal**

One night in early July, when my family was asleep in the living room, I went upstairs to take a leak and found myself drawn to my daughter Julia’s room. 

Her affliction, if I may call it that, began at the same time my wife became obsessed with gardening. Right after Bonitão impaled himself on the weather vane.

Only a few weeks after the mutt arrived.

She’s changed. I know it’s normal for a kid her age, God, I remember what it’s like, or at least I think I do, being thirteen. But this is not puberty. This is something else. Julia stopped smiling and cracking jokes. She stopped missing the city and going outside. She sleeps during the day and spends the whole night awake, alone in her room. Well, not *exactly* alone.

The mutt is always there.

I tried to get her to break this insomniac cycle and regulate her sleep schedule, but nothing worked. By June, things had gotten to the point where most days I couldn’t get her to wake up and go to school.

That night, however, I decided to try something else. I slipped a tab of Xanax in her glass of orange juice. I know. An awful thing to do. But I could no longer bear the thought of her spending all her waking hours alone, wide awake in the dark depths of the night, with nothing but her shadow and that dreadful dog for company.

As I entered her room I noticed she’d been writing. There was a pile of paper covered in writing on her desk, which upon closer inspection I discovered to be some sort of journal, full of strange lists such as this:

>*Things I want*

>*I want to write something dark and terrible which though twisted and woven of nightmare may like a veil punctured by rot let a sliver of moonlight shine through.*

>*I want to sing something that stirs up the nameless shapeless uncountable things that lurk in the corners of sleep-deprived visions.*

>*I want to raise the lowest to the highest of heights and make the hideous seem even more radiant than the most beautiful angel of all.*

>*I want to catch fear and trap it and grind it to ink and use its wet beetle-back blackness to conjure yet more fear so that I’ll never run out of shadows to write with.*

>*I want to spell death with letters other than D-E-A-T-H.* 

A frightful discovery which made me shiver and was so unexpected I could scarcely believe my eyes. My daughter had never shown the slightest predilection towards the gothic and the dreadful. By choice, up until then, she’d always been a rigidly gender-coded daddy’s girl. I turned the sheet over and found more and more scribblings, black shapes and odes to darkness, poems of violence and drawings of death.

Revolting. I put the papers down and walked away. When I got back to the living room, my daughter was awake, staring at me, the mutt nestled beneath her legs.

“Why did you do that?” she asked. 

“What do you mean?” I pretended not to know what she was talking about.

“If you want to know the things I can see now, dad,” she said, her voice oddly hypnotic, “all you have to do is ask. I'm just *dying* to show you.”

I found myself just standing there, scared of my own daughter.

The mutt licked its lips as she scratched its ears.

  


**5. My son’s peculiar aphasia**

My son no longer speaks. He barks and whines and howls.

It’s been three months since I’ve last heard him utter a word.

The doctor says there’s no neurological reason for his strange aphasia. The source is most likely psychological, he says.

A whole lot of good *that* does me.

  


**6. I dream of the backyard tree**

Every single night since the cat died I dream of the backyard tree.

In my dreams the tree is terribly tall and made of strange yellowed bones. Its flowers, the color of blackened blood, are larger than my head. Some of them look ready to bloom. Others are still fat blood-gorged buds. Some have black sightless eyes in their petals, others sets of sharp disjointed teeth.

My wife irrigates its roots with blood.

My daughter stands a few meters away, painting dreadful portraits of the tree.

My son, on all fours, barks and growls by the mutt’s side.

And the mutt, well…

It stands on two feet like a grotesque circus beast and speaks to me. Its voice is not its own. It speaks in the tones it stole from my son.

“You must hate me,” it says, its mouth moving monstrously. “You must continue to fear and hate and despise. All your attempts to get rid of me, all your rage, all your lifetime of pent-up frustrations, it is all food for the tree.”

It points at the hellish skeleton tree with its front paw in evil mockery of human behavior. I follow its lead and see that there are some trees that are already beginning to turn into fruit. But not *quite* fruit. 

The flowers are turning into the heads of raging hounds.

“What *are* you?” I roar. “What do you *want* from us?”

“I am Life,” it says.

“No. You are Death.”

“Is there really a difference?” it asks.

The ghastly dog heads blooming behind it bark and growl and my son howls alongside them.

“I will kill you,” I swear.

“I won’t die,” it replies.

I suddenly become aware there is a knife in my hand.

I raise the knife to stab the mutt, the stray, the *thing* in its grim cataract-clouded eye.

My wife screams, my daughter cries, my son continues to bark.

The mutt laughs and I wake up.

  


**7. What comes next**

My wife spends all her time caring for the tree. In real life, it’s nowhere near as monstrous a sight as it is in my dreams. Nothing more than a regular oak. But it *is* growing frighteningly fast.

I can tell from her expression she can barely stand the sight of me. 

My daughter scribbles wicked things in her journal, paints foul portraits of the most vile visages, scratches profane poetry on her walls.

My son follows the mutt, barking at the sun and howling at the stars.

My children have stopped going to school. I told the administration we were moving back to the capital. I can’t bear the thought of them being in public. I think about calling a doctor, but I’m afraid they’ll take my family from me.

I know *I* would.

It's August now. September will soon come. The mutt is still here, but I know what it is now. I know what it eats. I know what it wants.

What it eats is our sanity.

What it wants is to eat.

It will feed and feed and feed, it will gorge and grow and swell until the blood-black flowers on its dreadful skeleton tree bloom into the drooling faces of other rabid-eyed mutts, until its terrible fruit gives birth to new, even more terrible things, to more of whatever *it* is, until one day its sinister offspring go out into the wild to find their own nesting grounds, their own minds to eat, their own corner of love to fill with putrescence and hate.  

I can’t take this anymore. My mind is studded with holes. My emotions are scattered clippings of meat. My reason’s been gnawed to bits.

I took it to the shelter and it found its way back.

I drove it 200 kilometers away and left it by the road and still it came back.

I put it in a bag filled with rocks and threw it in a pond. 

Still it came back.

I’m thinking of taking an axe to its head, but I’m scared of what will come out the wound.

Should I shoot it?

Should I shove it in the wood chipper?

Should I set it on fire?

What could possibly save my family now?

I fear I know exactly what comes next.

God help us.

God help *me.*
