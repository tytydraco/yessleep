IT HAPPENED.  IT FINALLY HAPPENED.

Cassie met the devil.

It was as chaotic as I feared.  We were sitting in the living room, watching a movie, when the front door of our apartment burst open.  The deadbolt, which was shut, shot straight out of the door and went flying across the floor of the apartment, through the doorway of my bedroom, and finally came to a stop somewhere out of sight.  The door itself was thrown violently into the wall with only slightly less force than was used to eject the lock.  The doorknob left a sizable hole in the drywall.  

RIP our security deposit.

Standing there, holding a plastic pitchfork, wearing a red leotard, a plastic devil horn headband, and fishnet stockings (which were held on by suspenders because I guess that’s his *thing*), was the devil.

“I’m here,” he said grandly as he strode into the living room, “I’ve arrived.  With prese - oh gosh no don’t pause the movie, this is my favorite part!”

Behind him, the door sadly swung shut.  Cassie was frozen in place, her eyes so wide they almost bulged out of her skull, her hand on her cellphone to presumably dial 911.  I was reaching for the remote because after I’d recovered from my initial shock of having the door lock explode across the floor, I realized who it was and my panic quickly diminished into resignation.

“It’s fine,” I sighed to Cassie.  “I know who this is.  Unfortunately.  He’s the devil.”

He flopped down on the sofa next to me and gleefully rubbed his hands together.

“Do you want the dirt on the actor here?” he asked.  “Oh have I got *all* the dirt.”

“No,” I said.

“Yes,” said Cassie.

Anyway, we finished our movie while being treated to a running narration of every bad thing whichever actor on-screen ever did, which sounds exciting, except the devil decided to recite it in chronological order, starting with the oldest misdeeds first, which was a bunch of trivial shit like ‘one time in second grade this actress lied to her parents about not eating her dessert first.’  We’d barely made it into middle school for the lead actress by the time the movie ended.

So if you’re hoping for some juicy gossip, I don’t have any.  Also, I was mildly panicking the whole time so I wasn’t paying close attention.  If he slipped in anything significant, I probably missed it.  I’d told Cassie about the devil as part of my “not keeping secrets” campaign and she hadn’t made a big deal about it, but he was *here* and it was now an immediate reality instead of a remote concern.

Also there was the whole problem of him partially demolishing our front door.

Cassie, however, was more curious than upset by his presence.  Once the movie ended and I turned the TV off, she pivoted to face him and I saw on her face that she was mentally sorting her list of questions.  There was a glint in her eyes that meant she was going to have answers and no one, not even the actual devil himself, was going to stand in her way.

Sadly, he also saw where this was headed, and yes, the devil *was*, in fact, going to get in her way.

“You get one question,” he said curtly.

Cassie opened her mouth.

“And not that one,” he quickly added.

She tried again, but he again cut her off before she could speak.

“Not that one either, I’m sick of it.”

She stared at him for a moment, clearly exasperated, then took a sharp breath.

“Why are you such a dick?” she snapped.

“Someone has to be,” he replied.

So that was Cassie’s one question.  I’m not sure why we expected anything else.  This is the devil we’re talking about.

“Why are you here?” I sighed.  “My grades are fine.”

“I have a present.  Remember when I said I’d give you something if you took care of the Folklore Society’s little problem?  Well, you did.”

“But the thing in the hallway is still there.  I didn’t kill it.”

He went very still, poised on the edge of the sofa, his eyes like onyx.

“*I’m* not the one asking you to kill things,” he said quietly.  “You dealt with it.  You get your reward.”

Yes.  Both Cassie and I noticed how he said that.  But she’d used up her one question and I knew better than to try, because despite his utterly ridiculous appearance, the devil was here in his full capacity as a dealmaker.  We wouldn’t get answers for free.  He’d given us just enough to set things in motion, much like Loki did when he handed over a spear made of mistletoe.

I fear what will come out of this.  I fear finding the answer to the question we all have now.

The flickering man’s death was intentional.  But who, other than the laundry lady, was the reason behind it?

He reached behind him and pulled something out of a non-existent back pocket.  (remember, friends, that he was wearing a leotard.  If I’m cursed to carry that memory, then you must also be cursed to at least have the mental image)  He placed it on the coffee table in front of us.

A stake.  A simple metal stake.  The kind that I’d expect to find at a hardware store, at least I’d assume so, I’m not handy so I haven’t been in a hardware store that much.  Which was going to make putting the door lock back in rather challenging.

“This is an upgrade from the pencil,” I said.

“Isn’t it?”  He sounded pleased with it.  “And to make this gift even better, I’m going to tell you what you need to do with it this time.  Aren’t I great?”

This didn’t feel great at all.  It felt like a trap.

“Take it to the graveyard and drive it into the tree,” he said.  “You know which one.”

There was a moment of silence in the room.  Then Cassie voiced what I was certainly thinking.

“Uh, what the fuck,” she said.

“Yeah, I uh, I’m not convinced the tree is a bad thing,” I said.  

It was nice having Cassie there for this conversation.  It made me feel like I could argue back against the devil.  He seemed completely unconcerned about being ganged up on, his hands resting on his knees, relaxed with the confidence that at the end of this conversation, I was going to take the stake and do as he asked.

“Sometimes,” he said blandly, “You have to make things worse before you make them better.”

Cassie muttered ‘bullshit’ under her breath, but I wasn’t listening to her anymore.  I was lost in my head, thinking of the stories I’d heard, because I *did* take that folklore class and I *do* know things now.  And this was how trickster worked.  They did the damage and then they repaired it.  Loki cut off Sif’s hair and then replaced it with shining gold.

“Trickster stories don’t tend to end well,” I said.

Loki also got his mouth sewn shut for his troubles.

“No.  They don’t.  But we are also a catalyst for *change*.”

He got up.  The stake lay on the table in front of us still and neither I nor Cassie were willing to touch it.  Logically, there was no reason to refuse it at this point, because we could just keep it in the apartment and decide whether or not to do as he asked later.  We weren’t obligated to use it at this point.  It was a gift.  Not a request, not a demand.  He’d given it to us.  The choice was ours what to do next.

But I felt, as my heart pounded in my chest, that if he left it - it would be used.  I didn’t know why. What could possibly compel me to damage the one thing on campus that seemed to be actively set against the inhuman creatures around here.  I couldn’t think of why I would do as he asked.  But I knew.  If he left it, something would lead me down that path to the tree in the center of the graveyard, stake in hand.

“Hey,” Cassie said, as the devil reached the door, “could you fix that before you go?  Seeing as you broke it and all.”

Y’all, I was flabbergasted that she asked.  Asked.  The devil.  To fix our door.

And I was even more astonished *when he did*.

So now we’re calling the deadbolt the “devil lock” even though all he did was stick the old deadbolt back in and it just… went back together…? and there’s nothing out of the ordinary about it.

He didn’t do anything about the hole in the wall though.  Josh helped us fix that.  We spackled it over and hopefully the landlady won’t be able to tell when we move out.

“That was weird,” Cassie said, after he was gone.  “He’s not as… evil… as I expected.”

“He’s a trope,” I muttered.  “In a lot of folklore he takes the place of a trickster.  A supernatural prankster, basically.  He’s the devil but he’s not *the* devil, if you know what I mean.”

She eyed the stake still sitting on the coffee table.

“What do you think will happen if you hammer that into the tree?” she asked.

“I don’t know, but it’s not going to be good.”

“Then let’s throw it away.”

She reached for the stake, to make good on her suggestion.  I shouted ‘NO’ at her, far quicker and louder than I meant to, and she froze in surprise.  I hastily explained that it was a gift and you couldn’t just throw away a gift, not from a creature like him.  Yes, he was friendly and helpful, but that could change in an instant if we insulted him and throwing away what he’d given us *was* an insult.

“Is it a gift then, or a curse?” Cassie muttered.

“It’s both,” I sighed.  “Definitely both.”

The stake is still on the coffee table.  Neither of us want to touch it.  It sits there, alone on the table, because even though Titanosaur routinely gets up on the table and throws everything onto the ground, he has left the stake alone.  Everything else goes onto the floor.  Textbooks.  The remote control.  Cellphones.  Especially cellphones.  But not the stake.

That alone feels ominous.

A few days after this we got a frantic call from Maria.  I immediately knew it was an emergency because she was calling me directly, instead of texting.  

“They found out about the power plant basement,” she said as soon as I picked up.  “I have no idea how.  They remember someone told them, but no one has any idea who that was.”

It was like my brain went blank at the mention of the power plant basement.  Maria was still talking but I wasn’t hearing the words.  Finally, I took a deep breath, and told her I needed her to start over and to please slow down and explain.  I wasn’t following.  I didn’t *want* to understand.  Something inside me had already realized what was happening and was screaming that I should hang up the phone before she confirmed it, before she told me that it was all happening again, but in different words, but it didn’t matter because I knew what it meant, I knew what she was saying.

The Folklore Society had learned about the power plant basement and that pool of water and now they were being drawn to it.  Like Patricia.  Like everyone else she got killed.

They’d just *happened* to be told about it.  By someone they couldn’t quite recall and none of them were bothered that they didn’t remember.  Not when the key to all their questions about this campus was being dangled right in front of them.

Like moths to the flame.

This was deliberate.  Someone had intervened to keep the Folklore Society from being disbanded.  And now someone had intervened to bring them to the pool of water.

The eye had been used to kill things on campus.  Then I took its place and killed the flickering man.  And now… was my usefulness reaching an end?  Was my remaining year at campus not enough?

Was someone trying to create another monster they could control, one they could simply point in a direction and wouldn’t be troubled by guilt or remorse?

“I tried to stop them,” she said.  “But they’re not listening.  They’ve always been good about listening to my concerns but they just dismissed them, saying it will all be fine.  They’re on the way to the power plant basement.  They’re going to put a phone on a selfie stick and shove it inside to take video.”

“They can’t do that,” I said dumbly.  It felt like my mind was no longer working.

“I think this is my fault,” Maria said.  She sounded like she was on the verge of tears.  “I told them Cassie and I were trying to fill it in and they didn’t need to worry about it, we had it handled.  Instead they… they want to help, I think?”

Deep, slow breaths.  I had to think.  I had to plan.  I asked who was involved.  The club president, plus three other people.  They were on their way over there now, but one had to go fetch the selfie stick from their dorm.  So we had some time.  I told Maria to meet me at the power plant.  I didn’t know what we’d do, but maybe I could… talk some sense into them.

I could tell them how Patricia and the others died.  How their heads were crushed and their bodies left behind.  How no one remembers them.

When I got there, I found the door to the power plant basement ajar.  Maria wasn’t waiting for me outside.  I’d gotten here as fast as I could, I’d run as much as possible, but I was too late.  I was too slow.  That damned selfie stick must have been on the way to the power plant.  I hesitated, everything in me screaming that I knew what was waiting for me in the basement and that I couldn’t do that, I couldn’t live through that again.

If I turned back here though, if I gave up this one time, then I felt like it’d be so easy to give up the next time too.  And so on and so forth, until perhaps one day I gave up on myself as well and I vanished and never came home, just like my father had vanished into the fields one day.

I forced myself to take that first step.  And once it was behind me, the rest fell into line, and I descended into the power plant basement.

I hate that this is a battle I have to fight with myself, over and over and over again.  It’s exhausting.

I found the Folklore Society president kneeling by the side of the pool.  The other students with him were standing a safe distance back.  The knot in my stomach loosened a fraction.  This wasn’t a great situation, but it wasn’t *that* situation.  Not yet.

I made my way over.  The president had submersed the selfie stick almost all the way into the pool of water.  He turned back to look at me as I approached, a look of surprise on his face.  He opened his mouth and I knew what he was going to say, astonishment at how the pool that should only be an inch deep just kept going, perhaps to ask me why we hadn’t told them about this to begin with.

Instead, a hand erupted from the surface of the pool.

It was stabbed through with slivers of wood, like a splintered tree branch.  They were shoved clear through the wrist, the arm, the hand.

And the fingers were stretched wide, reaching out to grab hold of the club president’s hand that was so close to the surface of the water.

I ran toward him.  We all did.  But it was Maria who was closest.

She reached forward to grab him, to pull him back.

And the stabbed student surged from the water, reaching out with both arms, but it wasn’t the president he was reaching for.  His arms went past the man’s head and that hand, riddled with pale slivers of wood, closed over Maria’s outstretched forearm.

And she, overextended already, leaning to grab at the club president, didn’t take much to pull off balance.

She fell into the pool.

Someone screamed.  I think it was me.  But I next remember being on my knees beside the pool, reaching into the water, and the others were with me, we were all reaching out, because Maria was there, she was breaking through the surface of the water, she was coughing and flailing and then her hand was in my hand and we *all* had her and we were pulling.

Pulling her out and onto the concrete floor of the basement.

“I’m okay,” she gasped.  “It’s fine.  I’m fine.”

For a brief moment I felt relief so intense I thought I would cry.  She was here.  She was okay.  

Then she raised her head and smiled at me.

It wasn’t her smile.  Her smile was lopsided and she showed her teeth.  I… didn’t think I knew what her smile was, but I do, because I saw what *wasn’t* her smile and I knew exactly what was wrong with it and that it wasn’t her’s.

I let that panic inside me bubble to the surface and I let myself cry.  It meant I didn’t have to pretend, I didn’t have to look at Maria and pretend that everything was okay even as everything inside me was screaming that she’d gone down into the water and hadn’t come back out.  And I wonder, if that was how it always was, if those students that Patricia had found out about had also come back as something else.

I don’t know.  I don’t care.  All I know is that it’s not Maria, even as she reassured me that she was fine, as she told the Folklore Society president that maaaaybe they shouldn’t try this again.  That one close call was enough.  Then she patted me on the shoulder, said it was all okay, there was no harm done in the end.  And I, my face all scrunched up and ugly crying, just nodded and didn’t look at her.

Her smile.  It wasn’t hers, but neither was it unfamiliar. 

I didn’t go back to my apartment.  I went to Professor Monotone’s office instead.  I asked if I could see the photo of James again.

He stood there, his arms draped over the shoulders of his friends, smiling at the camera.

There.  That was it.

That was the smile Maria had given me, in the power station basement, when she told me that everything was fine.  That she was fine.

That’s not Maria anymore.
