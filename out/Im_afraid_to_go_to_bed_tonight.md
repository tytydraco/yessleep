I should start with , .. I don’t know who “He” is.

He has seemingly come to me night after night for the last  10 nights, at first I played it off as a nightmare , and after the second night a reoccurring nightmare , but it’s been never ending , and I consider myself to be a fairly lucid and sane person , but there is no other explanation for what’s happening to me , besides some form of entity or the occult.

I just know I can feel his presence, and his presence means immanent danger. I first met him, or should I say felt him ten days ago as I mentioned when I went to bed. To describe him would be an impossible task, as impossible as it would be paradoxical.  He is all things offensive and terrifying , but he also has no distinguishing features. I just know I was in a house that was also as non descript but as it was familiar. I knew I felt his presence behind me , I’ve never been able to smell in dreams before, but the smell is something I can only describe as dead matter, or being, like when you walk by roadkill , or something adjacent to a dumpster on a hot summers day, so I had to run, it was my brains only response and no matter how fast I went he was always right behind me and closing, forever every room I would run into would appear sickly and gorier room by room, a sign of his proximity I have no doubt. As the rooms got more graphic and his presence closed in, I awoke.

Something wasn’t right however , I was awake , but something was off.. like being in a state of unfamiliar consciousness. As I’m trying to piece and assemble what is different then my usual awakenings, all forms of light in my room leave, and all I can see is the number 10 painted in neon on my wall. The glow you get under blue light or like at a glow in the dark event where the light colours are strangely neon.

I awoke, but the next night the same things happened but the lights come back for a fraction of a moment only to display the number has receded down to a 9. Again the following  next night the same thing but the flickers of light and dark speed faster , and the sound of a music box is playing so loud is can only be coming from in my mind. 5 fast, 4 faster , 3..2..All consuming darkness with a 1 in neon on my wall, and the music box has stopped, and the only sound that disturbed the darkness was a whisper of .. “ tomorrow”

I’m afraid to go to bed tonight because I don’t know what is going to happen when the wall displays zero. Please help, has anyone heard of something like this and how to beat it ?  It’s 849 PM and I’ve got like 8 hours of day left. I’ll repost tomorrow if I’m still here.
