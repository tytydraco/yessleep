“What exactly are we looking for, Captain?”

The question was asked by Company First Sergeant Jacobs, as we marched through a forest deep in southern Germany. Looking up from the map I was holding, I stared at Jacobs and shook my head, before looking back down at the map. Jacobs must have assumed it meant that I wasn’t at liberty to tell him and simply walked away to do other duties. However, truth be told, I didn’t know the answer either.

The night before, at the battalion command post, the Old Man had told me that I was to take my company and sweep the area for German forces. For the past few days, aerial reconnaissance noted large numbers of enemy trucks driving along uncharted roads in this sector, and so high command wanted to find out where they were heading to.

The forest had no major population centres or positions of known strategic importance, so it seemed strange to have so much activity there. Was there an operations base there, where the remnants of the German military could stockpile weapons and supplies for future resistance? Was there a POW camp or maybe one of those terrible prisoner camps being discovered all over Germany? No one really knew and it was up to me and my company to find out.

Moving through the forest, my company navigated through the trees and kept an eye out for any enemy activity. Despite the war nearing its end, we knew we had to keep alert. There were still some die hard units in places like this, so it was never good to let your guard down in case we encountered them. With reports of trucks rolling around this area, I felt that such units were most likely present.

Luckily for us, most of the morning was uneventful. Our search through the area found nothing but trees and rock. After resting at noon in order to eat, we soon continued our search, moving along the same direction until the lead platoon encountered a trail. Following this trail, we soon saw two trucks halted in the middle of the path. Meanwhile, dead German soldiers could be seen in and around the vehicles.

Cautiously approaching the trucks, the leading squad quickly made sure it was clear, before securing the surrounding area. I then ordered the company to hold, while me, Jacobs, my XO, and the platoon commanders inspected the trucks and the deceased German soldiers surrounding it. 

“Were they ambushed?” Second Lieutenant Henry Arnold, commander of Third Platoon, asked, as he stared at the trucks. To our surprise, the vehicles had various damage on their cabins and truck beds. To me it seemed as if someone took an axe and started swinging heavy blows on the trucks. It must have been some powerful man who did it, however, as the metal on the cabins was heavily shredded.

“It seems like it. The question now is, who did it?” My XO, First Lieutenant Daniel Jenkins, replied, as he inspected the dead men on and around the trucks. Like the vehicles, they seemed to have been attacked by an axe wielding assailant, as they had limbs sliced off. It was an awful sight and many of the men, who were battle hardened veterans of countless battles, had to look away from the terrible carnage.

“There aren’t any resistance groups here.” Second Lieutenant Henry Merill said. I nodded at this, as I remembered the briefing we had at battalion headquarters a few days before. The area we were in was deep in Germany and the people were either loyal or too afraid to resist. “Perhaps they were on their way to surrender to us and were ambushed by the die hard forces?”

I saw Sergeant Jacobs shake his head at this. “I doubt it, sir. Based on the direction their trucks are pointing, they would have been heading away from our lines, not towards it.”

“Then who could have done this and why?” Jenkins asked, but no one could answer. Instead, we stared at the gruesome sight, confused and worried.

Reporting what we encountered to battalion headquarters, I told them that we were unable to find out who was responsible for the destruction of the two German trucks and the death of its occupants. A sweep around the area found no signs of those who attacked them. The only sign that a battle had occurred was from the bullet casings the Germans fired and their dead bodies.

Acknowledging the information, battalion headquarters told us to be on high alert and to continue our search around the area. With that, I ordered the company to follow the trail and to keep their eyes open for any hostile activity. I did not want any of my men to meet the same faith as the Germans on the trucks had.

However, as we marched along the trail, the sight of the dead German soldiers, and the unknown reasons behind their deaths, continued to plague my mind. For some reason, I wanted to turn back to the safety of our lines. But, with no good reason to do so, I knew we had to continue. The sight of two truckloads of German soldiers found dead on a trail would not ease the Old Man’s anger at me if I told him I chickened out and failed to meet my objective.

The next hour of the march was without excitement, as we went along the trail and encountered nothing but the noise of the forest. Eventually though, Third Platoon, which was at the head of the company, reported to have found a heavily fortified mine entrance. 

Wasting no time, I quickly moved forward and joined Arnold, as he and his platoon laid prone in a depression that was covered with thick underbrush. From there, I could see flat open ground, which was covered with barbed wire, and had a concrete bunker covering it. Next to the bunker was a gun emplacement for a German 88. Meanwhile, behind the bunker, were two watchtowers that guarded the concrete entrance that led to a tunnel on the side of a mountain.

“The trail leads all the way there, sir.” Arnold said, before frowning. “It seems to be heavily defended, but there’s something you should know, sir.”

Before he could continue, I suddenly saw what he was most likely trying to tell me about. Staring through my field glasses, I saw a body laying on the ground, unmoving and seemingly dead. Then I noticed other bodies, around a dozen of them all over the enemy position. It seemed that the garrison there had already been taken out.

Looking away and turning towards Arnold, I stared at him with disbelief. Seeing my expression, he must have known that I already saw the dead German soldiers.

“Have you seen any sign of activity in those positions?” I eventually asked.

“None, sir.” Arnold said. “Me and the Platoon Sergeant observed the bunker, the gun emplacement, and those watchtowers, but saw no Germans aside from that dead. It could be a trap, but I’m not sure. If it is, it’s one gruesome way to draw us in.”

I nodded. The terrain in front of the bunker was a killing ground. If we crossed, we would be completely exposed. If this was indeed a trap, then the Germans could fire at us from hidden positions we haven’t seen yet. 

But was it really a trap?

It seemed strange for the enemy to bait us using dead men. It just didn’t seem right. 

Maybe it wasn’t a trap afterall? Maybe this was the work of the same assailants that ambushed the two trucks earlier. That thought concerned me a lot. If it was the work of that unknown party, why haven’t they made contact with us yet. Did it mean that they were hostile to both the Germans and us?

We didn’t know the answer, but we had to find out. To do that, however, we had to secure the enemy position ahead of us. With that, I prepared the company to advance.

The first to go forward would be Third Platoon. I ordered them to move up the trail and head towards the enemy bunker. As they advanced, the rest of the company would cover them, watching both the enemy fortifications and the high ground behind it, just in case there were enemy positions there. If they encountered heavy enemy fire, they were to turn back and regroup. 

As it turned out, their advance was met with no resistance. Eventually, they reached the German positions, cleared and secured it, before signalling to us that it was safe for the rest of the company to join them.

Reaching the position, I immediately inspected the dead German soldiers and looked on with dread to see that they had similar injuries to those from the ambushed trucks. Dried blood could be found everywhere, bullet cases littered the ground, and severed limbs were scattered all over the place. It was an all too familiar sight. There was no doubt in my mind that they too were attacked by the same unknown party. The question now was, who were they and where were they now. 

Radioing battalion headquarters, I reported our position to them and told them what we found so far. In my conversation with the battalion commander, I noticed that the Old Man seemed to be more interested in news of us finding a mine than the report that unknown parties attacked and killed the German garrison that guarded its entrance. His excitement regarding the former was probably because of the treasures German mines seemingly held. 

Over the past month, Allied units have been finding mines that German authorities used as storage areas. Sometimes they used them to stockpile weapons and supplies, other times they used them to hide their spoils of war. The Old Man was excited to find out what we had stumbled upon. Because of that, he ordered me to inspect the mine, while he and another company from the battalion moved towards our location. He wanted the inside of the mine inspected and secured by the time he arrived.

I would have preferred not to bring my men inside. We weren’t sure who was still down that mine, and if we ended up in a fight, a battle in confined and dark areas would be a nightmare. But I had orders to follow and I didn’t want to be on the Old Man’s bad side once he arrived. All I could do now was hope that whoever killed the Germans out here were friendly to us and had also eliminated any Germans inside the mine.

Leading Second and Third Platoon into the mine, I left First Platoon and the Weapons Platoon, under the command of Jenkins, outside. They were to guard the tunnel entrance in case any German forces suddenly arrived and trapped us inside.

Going through the tunnel, we saw more bodies on the ground. Some of them had been stabbed, others had limbs cut off. As I observed the bodies all over the tunnel, I couldn’t help but wonder if they died trying to head into the mine or trying to get out of it.

Managing to reach the end of the tunnel without incident, we found a large elevator platform. Just like other parts of this place, its floor was covered with dried blood. After inspecting the elevator to make sure it was safe, a squad, with the Second Platoon commander, Second Lieutenant Justin Trevor, was lowered down. After a few minutes, the platform rose back with one of his men, who said that it was safe to go down and that I would be amazed to see what they found. Curious, I inquired what they saw down there. 

“It’s some kind of factory, sir.”

“What kind of factory?” I asked, as we rode the platform down.

“Rockets, Captain.” He said, scratching his head. “Like the ones they have been throwing at London. Except, they’re bigger. They remind me of the time we went to New York to board the ship across the Atlantic.”

The rockets were indeed bigger. The underground room itself was huge.

It was like an aircraft hangar, deep under a mountain. Somehow the Germans managed to carve out a gigantic room this far beneath the ground. Upon my initial inspection, the distance between the floor and ceiling was probably around two hundred feet.

All around this gigantic area were various rockets of various sizes, with some lying down, some standing up. This was indeed a factory for Germans rockets. However, just like above, dead bodies, bullet cases, and limbs also covered the place. But, unlike above, the dead were not just soldiers. Instead it was a combination of soldiers and civilians, with the latter most likely being the technicians and labourers who worked in this facility.

The presence of death within the mine itself told me that the unknown assailants had gotten in here too. Whether they were still in here or not, I wasn’t sure, but the sight of so many dead was concerning. With us still not knowing what their intentions were, I ordered the men to keep their eyes open and to be careful at every corner. For all we knew, they might not be targeting just the Germans. 

As we began to search the area, I couldn’t help but inspect some of the rockets held there. There were rockets of various sizes and I was amazed how the Germans were able to produce these large machines in such quantities. Clearly their underground industry and infrastructure was far greater than we thought.

One of the smaller rockets in there was over forty feet long and had a diameter of over five feet. Upon approaching one, I recognized them as the V2. It looked exactly just like the ones in the photographs the battalion S-2 showed us. 

The other rockets though, I could not recognize, but they were definitely bigger than the V2s.

Looking around even more, I noticed one type of rocket that stuck out from the rest.

This rocket had a strange shape, one that made it resemble a bell and stood on four pylons that acted as its legs. Standing at around sixty feet in height, and having a diameter of around twenty feet, it was definitely one of the bigger rockets there. 

Inspecting it, I noticed that, unlike the others, it had no engines on it. Instead, the bottom was flat and there seemed to be no place for any of the rocket engines to be placed on. Another strange thing about them was that they had these large ramps on their side that led to the interior. Glancing inside, I could see that there were seats and controls in there, just like a cockpit. Seeing that made me wonder if what I was looking at was a rocket, since I assumed that those areas were supposed to be where the fuel was, not a cockpit. I was tempted to go inside and look around more, but decided against it. There could be boobytraps that could destroy the equipment and harm me. 

There were two of the bell shaped rockets in the hangar, with one seeming to have some form of major damage, while the other had a few dents on its hull, but was largely intact.This latter rocket seemed to have been undergoing maintenance, however, since many of its panels were removed, while its machinery were littered all around it.

As I continued to explore the hangar, one of the soldiers from Third Platoon approached me and said that Lieutenant Arnold requested my presence. Earlier, I had ordered Third Platoon to further explore the facility and search the other rooms there, while Second Platoon remained at the hangar, clearing it and doing the best they could to pile the German dead to one corner of the hangar. After looking around the vast facility, it seemed that Arnold and his platoon had found something important.

Taking a stairwell at the side of the hangar, the Third Platoon man led me up a few flights of stairs until we reached a room. In the room, Arnold stood there waiting.

The room he was in was filled with cabinets and tables covered with folders and documents. Gesturing to one of the tables, I looked to where Arnold was pointing and was impressed by what I saw. Schematics for one of the rockets was there, laid right in front of us. Smiling, I gave Arnold a path on the back, knowing his find would be helpful for the engineers who would be studying the rockets we found here.

Looking around the room, I found more schematics for the other rockets I saw at the hangar. Then, turning my attention away from the various rocket drawings and towards the documents, I decided to grab one of the papers and see what they contained. I had some ability in speaking and reading the German language, thanks to a childhood friend of mine who was the son of a German immigrant, so I didn’t have difficulty reading what was written.

*Military Encounters with Out of Earth Beings.*

This piqued my interest. Out of Earth beings, what did they mean by that? Wanting to learn more, I continued to read.

*August 1943* 

*A patrolling Me 109, from a fighter squadron based in France, sighted a bell-shaped object flying near Paris. An attempt to intercept was made, but the object increased speed and altitude, preventing the Me 109 from catching up. Said flying object was later classified as Die Glocke.*

This made me think for a second.The ‘Bell’, Die Glocke in Deutsch. Did this mean the bell looking rocket at the hangar? I believed that it did. 

*February 1944*

*During the first sub-orbital test flight of the A9 manned rocket, the test pilot reported seeing a disk-shaped spacecraft in the distance. From this object, which would later be labelled as ‘Mothership’, he sighted a Glocke exit, before moving towards him. The Glocke would trail the A9 until the latter reentered the atmosphere.*

*March 1944*

*During the A9’s first operational mission, which was to conduct photo reconnaissance of Washington D.C., the manned rocket was intercepted by a Glocke at an altitude of three hundred and ninety kilometers above the Atlantic ocean. The pilot reported seeing a bright flash of light emitting from Die Glocke, before all contact and data from the A9 was lost. It was later determined that the loss of the rocket was due to an attack from Die Glocke through an unidentified weapon. After this incident, military high command has labelled these entities in orbit over the planet as hostiles.*

*May 1944* 

*After detecting an unidentified object flying over Nuremberg by radar facilities in the area, one Ju 88R-1 was dispatched to intercept the flying object. The Ju 88R-1 located the object flying low and engaged it. After successfully scoring hits, the object crashed in the middle of the field. Ground forces would later recover the object and discover the deceased remains of out of Earth beings inside. The object itself would be recovered, identified as a Glocke, and taken to an underground facility for study.*

*July 1944*

*Operation Jäger.*

*After careful preparations, military forces conducted a strike against the orbiting ‘Mothership’. The task was given to the Luftwaffe’s 1st Outer Space Squadron. Six A9 manned rockets, each armed with a single radio guided missile, and each stacked atop their own A10 and A11 rockets, were launched to intercept the ‘Mothership’ spacecraft.* 

*Upon reaching orbit, the A9s conducted course corrections in order to approach the out of Earth spacecraft and get within missile range. During the approach, a Glocke exited the ‘Mothership’ and approached the A9s. Through the use of a heat weapon, it managed to destroy two of the A9s, before being destroyed by two radio guided missiles from two of the four remaining A9s.* 

*With two missiles left available, two A9s pressed the attack and got within missile range. They fired their missiles and successfully damaged the ‘Mothership’. Reports from the pilots state the damage must have been substantial, as they saw two Glocke vacate the spacecraft and enter the atmosphere.*

*One of the Glocken that evacuated the mothership was found landing in southern Germany. A Wehrmacht infantry battalion was garrisoned in the area and quickly surrounded the Glocke. After a brief engagement, the battalion managed to kill two out of Earth beings and knock unconscious two others. They, along with the Glocke, which was lightly damaged from the fighting, were brought to an underground facility for observation and study.*

After reading this, I was left dumbfounded. Was all that I read true? It seemed too outrageous to be. Yet, remembering the bell shaped rockets in the hangar, I began to wonder if there was some truth to this document.

But, if this was indeed true, then where were these out of Earth beings the Germans claimed to have captured. Were they being held in this facility? This thought nearly made my heart skip a beat. If they were indeed being held here, then where were they contained? 

Then another thought came into my mind. Were they even still contained? 

Remembering the dead bodies and the gruesome ways they were killed, I assumed that they could have been the work of these beings. I then realized that we could be trapped here with creatures far stronger than us. 

At that moment I was lost. I didn’t know if I should believe the document or throw it away as rubbish. 

I was in the middle of debating with myself about that topic when Arnold’s Platoon Sergeant came racing up the stairs.

“Sir.” He said to Arnold, before turning to me. “Captain.” He then paused, catching his breath, before continuing. “We found something you both need to check out.”

Shoving the document into my pocket, I nodded and ordered the Sergeant to lead the way.

Moving down and going through long dark halls, the Sergeant brought us deeper and deeper into the facility. With each hall, the occasional dead German could be found. Eventually we reached a hallway, where two of Third Platoon’s soldiers stood at the entrance. Laying on the floor next to them where two dead German soldiers, whose arms were cut off from their torso. Ushering us in, the Platoon Sergeant waited for me and Arnold to enter before following us.

Inside the room were two large metal doors, both of which were ajar. Behind each door was a large metal bed that had multiple chains attached to it.  It didn’t take long for me to realise that it was some kind of holding cell. 

Moving towards the closest cell, I noticed that the metal door was at least five inches thick. Yet, despite its thickness, it was clearly heavily damaged. Dents on the metal could clearly be seen, as if someone had been punching it.

Not only that, but the door had a hole where the large mechanical lock should have been. Looking around, I found the heavy lock laying on the other side of the room, as if it had been pushed off. I frowned upon seeing that. Something from inside must have applied enough force to remove the lock. 

Whatever was in there, I knew it couldn’t have been human. No man could have had the strength to do that. With no signs of explosives being used, it was obvious that sheer natural strength had kicked the lock off of the door.

Turning my attention to the other cell, I noticed that its door also had dents. However, the lock on that one was intact, although unlocked. My assumption at the time was that whatever was contained in the first cell, it had gotten out and freed the one in the other cell.

After seeing the damage on the metal doors, and noting the chains on the bed, I quickly remembered what I had read earlier in the German document. This must be where the Germans kept the creatures they captured from the spacecraft. 

Realizing that there was indeed truth to what was written on that paper, a sense of urgency suddenly filled me. Lurking in this mine, or possible in the surrounding forest, were creatures not from this planet. At that point, I knew that we were in danger. 

Turning away from the cells, I quickly stomped back towards the hallway. As Arnold followed close behind, I told him about the paper I read and the possibility that the Germans were killed by the creatures they kept in here. I then ordered him to gather his platoon and meet me by the elevator platform. I wasn’t sure if he believed what I said, but he gave no questions. With that he and his Platoon Sergeant, along with the two members of the platoon that were already there, went to find the rest of his men.

Meanwhile, I took a different route and began to make my way back to the large hangar area.

There was a threat in this mine and the whole sector. I knew that I had to get my men out of the facility, in case one, or both, of the creatures was still in here. I also knew that I needed to contact the battalion commander and tell him about the possibility of a being from outer space lurking in the forest, waiting to ambush them like the two German trucks from earlier.

As I made my way through the maze of hallways, the distinct sound of gunfire immediately halted me. It was a continuous burst and I identified it as the sound of a Thompson submachine gun. One of my men was firing at something.

Raising my carbine, I made sure it was loaded and ready to go. Then, taking a step forward, I cautiously navigated the hallways, being careful with each corner and making sure that there was nothing there to ambush me.

Eventually, I began to hear voices as I neared a turn towards another hallway. Recognizing the voice, I felt some relief knowing that it came from First Sergeant Jacobs. However, the relief quickly turned into panic, as I realized what he was saying.

"Come on!” I heard him shout. “Move faster, it’s gaining on us!”

Rushing forward and turning the corner, I looked on to see three of my men heading towards my direction. A terrified expression could be seen on their faces as they ran for their lives. Behind the three was Sergeant Jacobs, who held his ground and fired his submachine gun at something at the other end of the hallway. Since the lighting there was dark, it was hard to tell what exactly he was trying to hit.

But, as he turned around to fall back, a creature I have never seen before soon emerged from the darkness.

It was strange and it was terrifying. The creature was nothing what I had expected a being from space would have looked like. I had read a couple of science fiction comics before the war and every single time they showed creatures from other planets, they always looked human. However, what we encountered in the facility was far from human.

At first glance the creature looked similar to a spider, a very large spider that towered over an average man. But as it got closer, I noticed that although its silhouette was similar to a spider, its features were nothing like the small creatures here on Earth.

Its body was nothing but a large black eye with a glowing red pupil. It was frightening and unblinking, and I watched it as it stared at Jacobs with murderous intent. Protruding from that eye were eight legs that moved in a fluid manner that was dissimilar to the way I knew spiders walked. 

It was also fast, as I saw it get closer and closer to Jacobs. Soon, it looked like it would be in range to jab one of its legs at the Sergeant. Remembering how many of the dead here had limbs cut off from their bodies, I feared that these creatures may have had razor sharp legs that could easily cut through flesh and bone.

Deciding to cover Jacobs as he retreated, I raised my carbine and pointed it at the creature’s eye. With it standing tall, I was able to aim at it without the risk of hitting the four men heading my way. Firing a few rounds at it, I managed to hit the creature. However, despite landing hits on it, the eye seemed unphased. Instead, it took a quick glance towards me, before returning its attention back on Jacobs. The eye was clearly tougher than it looked.

Unable to stop it or slow it down, I looked on with horror as it closed on Jacobs and extended a leg towards him. In a swift motion, the leg stabbed him in the back and exited out of his chest. The creature then lifted the screaming Jacobs and tossed him to the side, his body impacting the wall before falling on the floor. 

Then, without failing to stop, the creature continued to move and started heading towards my direction. Realizing that bullets wouldn’t be able to stop it, I decided against wasting ammunition on it. There was no hope fighting it. The only way to survive it was to get away. Once the three other men had gotten past me, I turned around and joined them.

We didn’t know where we were going, but we didn’t care. As long as we were heading away from the creature, then we would be safe. 

From behind, I could hear the sound of its sharp legs tapping on the concrete floor as it trained to gain up on us. Never before had I felt fear as the one I experienced at that moment. My mind flashed images of Jacobs getting stabbed by its legs and I was afraid that I would meet the same faith.

I don’t know how long we ran, but eventually we reached an area where one hallway intersected another. Standing at that intersection, I saw the distinct silhouettes of a couple of men. Calling out to them as we got closer, I soon recognized Arnold among them. 

“Fall back!” I shouted at him. “Get away!”

He just stared at me with a stunned and confused expression. Clearly he and his men hadn’t encountered the creature yet.

It didn’t take long for him to see it though, as I could hear it close behind me. The change on Arnold’s face aws clear, as I saw him fix his gaze to what was behind me. Without wasting time, he pointed his carbine towards the creature and shouted orders to his men to open fire on it.

I wanted to tell him to run away and not waste time shooting at it, but my words were drowned by the sound of carbine, rifle, and submachine gun fire that echoed in the hallway. I cursed in frustration at this, knowing that their bullets would do nothing to the creature. 

However, as we got closer to Arnold and his group, I noticed them cease fire. Turning my head, I looked on in disbelief to see the creature turning around and fleeing from us. Although it did not seem to be injured, the volume of fire Arnold’s men poured out must have been enough to dissuade it from pressing on its advance.I had to remember that although it was strong it was not invincible. The Germans, afterall, managed to kill two of them. 

Conferring with Arnold once we were sure that the creature was nowhere near us anymore, he told me that he had around a squad of his men gathered with him. His other two squads were still spread out in other levels of the facility, so he had the Platoon Sergeant look around for them, while he led the rest to where he had heard gunshots erupting. Due to the complexity of the facility, Arnold and his group got lost and were in the middle of trying to figure out where they were when they ran into my group and the creature that trailed us.

Once he was done telling his perspective, I then informed him that we had to get up and out of the mine as soon as we could. The need to inform the battalion commander of the situation was crucial.

When he asked about his men that were still spread out in the facility, I regrettably told him that we can only hope that the Platoon Sergeant could find them and lead them out of here. There was not much we could do in locating them and if we stayed here we would only become targets for the creature.

Begrudgingly, he nodded his head. I didn't like the idea either, but our priority at that moment was to inform battalion headquarters of what we encountered here.

Working together, our group cautiously navigated the various hallways, as we listened for any sign of the creature nearby. Somehow, after many fearful minutes of wrong turns and shooting at things that weren’t there, we managed to reach the large hangar. By then our group had increased to twenty men, as we gathered some scattered soldiers from Third Platoon.

I had expected someone from Second Platoon to meet us upon our arrival there, since they surely must have been alerted by the various gunfire. However, what I saw made my heart sink.

The creature had gotten there already and had torn Second Platoon apart. Their bodies were strewn all over the hangar, lifeless, with some missing limbs. Like the German bodies we had found all over the facility, they now shared the same fate. I wasn’t sure how many of Second Platoon remained, but I knew that more than half of them were gone now.

Since the various squads were spread out throughout the large room, the creature must have been able to take them out one by one. Unable to form a heavy wall of fire, just like we had earlier, the members of the platoon were cut down and left helpless to stop it. This must have been what happened to the Germans in this facility. They were systematically targeted by this being from space.

Wasting no time to grieve, I quickly led my remaining men towards the elevator. Keeping our eyes wide open, we constantly scanned the area as we moved, in case the creature was still lurking nearby. 

As we reached the base of the elevator frame, one of the men pulled a lever to call it down. However, as the platform descended, we looked on with horror to see a creature standing on it.

Staring at the creature as it descended, I watched as it leaped out off the platform and onto the floor behind us. The creature then stabbed one of its legs before we could fire a shot, hitting a soldier and penetrating him right on the chest. As the creature pulled back its leg, the man fell to the floor, before laying flat as blood pooled around him. 

Letting loose our weaponry against it, we fired everything we got at it. But even with the heavy torrent we placed on it, the creature managed to swing one of its legs and cut off the arm of another soldier. Quickly, he was grabbed and supported by the man standing next to him, but this resulted in a slight reduction in our firepower.

Our onslaught against the creature was further reduced, when I heard the distinct sound of multiple legs crawling from another corner of the hangar. Looking in that direction, I saw another creature move and rush towards us. 

Both creatures were now present before us and I was forced to divide our fire in order to deal with both of them. This meant that the intensity of our barrage was not as I would have liked, but I prayed that it would be enough to stave off the two and keep them at a distance.


For a while it seemed to have worked, as the one closest to us backed off, while the one farther from us had difficulty approaching. I didn’t know how long we could hold this line. It was a tense moment, and I could feel my heart beat harder and harder, as I watched the creatures try to advance, only to fall back.

Knowing that our bullets wouldn’t be enough to kill these creatures, and having no intention to stay there forever, I gradually pulled back my men, as we slowly backed away towards the elevator platform. As we withdrew, me and Arnold made sure that we kept up a continuous rate of fire against the creatures. We knew that any slackening could open up a gap that would allow them to attack.

Slowly, but surely, we managed to get on the elevator and gradually rise up from the hangar. As we rose away from the creature, we continued to pour out hot masking fire against them, making sure that they wouldn't jump and hop on the platform. Only when we were sure they couldn't get us did we allow our bodies to relax and crash.

Riding the elevator up, we eventually reached the top where we were greeted by the sight of a heavily armed squad pointing all its weaponry at us. Scanning the faces, I noticed that Jenkins was among them.

Moving forward, Jenkins met me halfway and said that he was relieved to see me. 

Apparently, while we were busy evading the creature in the facility, Jenkins and his group encountered one that emerged from the forest. Rushing towards their position, they fired at it with all they got, but it continued its advance. Upon reaching their position, it managed to kill two men from First Platoon, before rushing towards the mine entrance. As they chased after it, they watched  it operate the elevator and descend down to where we were. After that, Jenkins informed the Old Man of what just happened, as he and the group kept careful watch of the elevator. They had assumed that the creature got to us and massacred my group, so he was relieved to see us get back up.

An hour after returning to the surface, the battalion commander arrived with another company. After briefing him of what occurred, he told me to gather my men and have them rest along the nearby treeline. The company he brought with him will be taking over the duty of  guarding the mine entrance.

Asking him when they’ll be sending a team to go down the mine and secure the facility below, he told me that he won’t until further reinforcements arrive. When I told him that I still had men down there, he simply shook his head. 

“They’re not worth the risk of losing more of my men.”

Dejected, I kept silent as I watched him walk away.

A few hours later, the rest of the battalion arrived, along with a company of engineers that was loaned to us by division headquarters. Armed with flamethrowers, bazookas, and light machine guns, a company from the battalion, along with the engineers, moved into the mine and descended down to the facility.

We waited anxiously for the courier they would send up once the operation was finished. After an agonizing hour, the courier came and said that the creatures were dead. One was killed after being set alight by a flamethrower and finished off by gunfire. The other was killed by a combination of bazooka and light machine gun fire. 

The price for this result was heavy. Around thirty men were killed.

Later on a new company was sent down to the facility to search for the missing men from my Second and Third Platoons. They were found, but all were dead.

For the next few days we remained in the area, keeping the facility secured. Then, five days after we first entered the mine, three companies of military police arrived, along with officers from the Office of Strategic Services. 

One by one, the officers from the OSS visited each company and told us all the exact same thing.

The events that occurred in the facility did not officially happen. We were to keep quiet about it and never tell anyone. If asked what happened to our units during the past few days, we were to say we encountered a German resistance pocket in the area and engaged them in heavy fighting.

With that, the ended their talk with a threat, saying that any man who spoke of what really happened here would be found and dealt with. We didn’t need an explanation to know what he meant.

We stayed there for another day, before regimental headquarters sent trucks to pick us up. The MPs would be left in charge of guarding the facility, as the OSS officers took over all operations there.

As we drove away from the mine, I gave one last glance at it before looking away. Quietly, I prayed that I would never see such horrors like that again.

My grandfather left this account in an old notebook. I found the notebook in a box filled with his old things during his military service. After his death last year, I was hoping to make a little article about him online, in order to honor the man my family knew and loved.

However, after reading this account, I am left to wonder if what he wrote was real or not. At first, I found it hard to believe. But after going through his notebook, I found something interesting that made me realize that there must be some truth in what he said.

Left between the pages of the notebook was an old piece of paper with German text on it. Translating some of it, it read: 

Military Encounters with Out of Earth Beings.
