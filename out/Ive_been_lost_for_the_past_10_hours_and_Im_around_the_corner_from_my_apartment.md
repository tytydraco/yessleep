I've lived in New York City since I was born, and I used to dream of staying here until I die. I love the crowded streets and never-ending ambient noise of the city. It's become the background ambiance to my daily life for the past 30 years, and the few times I've visited others places, I've felt cold and alone without it. 

There is a special magic to NYC that you can only truly feel once you've lived here as long as I have. I've heard of tourists feeling it for short bouts during visits, but to truly experience it, you have to let the city break you.

You have to go through what I call "The City's Trial".  One day, while living in the city, everything will go wrong. Your train will be late, you'll spill coffee on your brand new blouse, a homeless man will curse you out on your way to lunch. Anything that can go wrong, will. This isn't random chance, friend. This is the city testing you.

Whenever someone I meet tells me that they've moved to New York recently, I always get one of two opinions. They either reject the city or embrace it. Those who embrace it have conquered their Trial, and they are open to the city's wonder.

This city has a way of pushing your limits. Despite my praise and love for New York, I will admit that, at times, I've dreamed of leaving. Running away to some small town in Philadelphia or Iowa. Getting out from under the city's oppressive grasp. 

But I stayed. Not because I love the city, though I still do. But because I understand it. I've formed a bond with this city that I thought was unbreakable, until today. 

Today, I've failed my Trial.

I work as a business analyst at a company in Uptown Manhattan, where I spend most of my day reviewing ledgers and other various documents. It's a boring job. I've been trained in business analytics since university, and it took me too long to realize that I actually hated the work, despite being good at it. It's a curse like no other.

I had just finished up my final report for the day when some coworkers asked me out for drinks. I don't particularly like or dislike my coworkers; they're...fine. I honestly have no opinion on them either way personally. Despite this, I always accept their offers. New York is a wonderful place, but it can also be quite lonely.

The night was mundane at best. We visited a bar a few blocks down from our office that businessmen usually frequent. The beer is cheap there, so we stayed for a few hours idly chatting about home life and recent topics.

I usually avoid talking about my home life, as I don't have much of one. I've been focused on my career since I was in university, and I haven't had the time nor the energy to pursue friends or relationships outside of it. The upside is that I live in one of the nicest apartment buildings in Manhattan. The downside is that I rarely have a reason to leave it.

It's hard to even recognize what constitutes as a "friend" as an adult. Is it someone who you see frequently? Who shares your interests? Who has your back? These are three different levels of relationship, but they can all fall under the umbrella of "friend". Even thinking about it to this level is exhausting.

There's a corner shop that sells fresh beef patties near my work, so once I called it a night with my coworkers, I headed in its direction. For some reason, beer makes me hungry, so I picked up two patties on my way home this time.

I've been working in the same office for almost five years, and I have my route home memorized. I walk five blocks up to 97th, then make a right and head down another 3 blocks. I make a left, and I'm a block away from my apartment. Even drunk, the route is so ingrained into my brain that my feet practically walked it on their own.

I always know which turn to make before I get home, as there's a little flower shop at the intersection where I make the turn. Tonight, it was different.

I passed the closed flower shop, and in my drunken stupor, I rounded the corner to my apartment. At the end of the empty, dimly lit street, was the same flower shop. I walked for a few paces before I noticed it, then I noticed everything else. I was walking down the same street.

I looked around, noticing the same brick architecture and sparse shrubs that lined the street before my final turn home. It was past midnight, and the streets were eerily quiet. I passed off the incident as a side effect of my drunkenness, and continued the walk down to the flower shop. 

I rounded the corner, and again, faced the same street that I had just walked. Seeing the flower shop again burned off some of the alcohol, and I felt a deep chill down my neck. Something was definitely off. 

I walked briskly to the shop this time. I felt my breath quicken as I turned the corner to see the small flower shop perched at the far off intersection. 

I felt like I was going mad. Maybe the alcohol had been laced with something, and I was just feeling its effects now. But at that moment, I felt nearly sober. I turned back the way I came, sure that I was just feeling off. But as I reached the start of my journey, I saw the little petal logo peaking around the corner.

I started to panic. I didn't know what was happening around me, and I felt my sense of perspective crumble as I ran down the street again. The dim street lights felt harsh to my eyes, and the ground felt heavy under my feet. I ran past the shop again, and sprinted around the corner down the street. I took a few laps before giving up, my legs screaming in protest at the sudden punishment. 

I took the opportunity to take in my surroundings. The street looked...calm. It was quiet, and almost all of the lights inside the apartments and business were off. Except for one.

A small window above a sandwich shop was lit, the bright orange glow serving as a beacon to my confusion- and alcohol-rattled brain. With nowhere else to go, I decided to try the house. I sighed as I stood, making my way over to the window. It was on the highest floor of the building, so I called up to it.

"Hello! Is anyone up there?", I yelled.

No response. A shadow passed by the drapes.

"Hey! Can you help me please? I think I'm lost!"

All I heard from the window was soft shuffling, and suddenly, the light went out. Frustrated, I continued walking.

I walked for hours, trying every other exit and back alley on the street. I turned the other way at the flower shop, went through a building lobby to another street, and went through multiple alleyways. No matter which way I went in, I would always come out on the same street, the flower shop at its end.

I knocked on every door on the block, calling out to whoever was inside. Besides the first window, no sound or sign of life came from the other side. It was as if the street had been vacated, just for me. There wasn't any wind or rain, or any sounds to indicate any other presence than my own. Even the time hadn't changed much, as despite having been exploring for hours, the sky was still dark.

I don't usually wear watches, so I had no idea what time it was. My phone died at the bar, and with no person responding to me, I had no way of getting a charger. I was completely stranded.

Despite the picturesque sameness of the street, one thing had changed. Whenever I made a pass through an alley, lobby, or street exit, the streetlights would dim subtly. I didn't even notice it after my first few escape attempts, but after a few hours of trying, the street had become noticeably darker.

I've given up on trying to escape for now. My many attempts have been futile, and I would rather not wander around in complete darkness. The place is eerie enough.

And now, here I am. Perched on a set of stairs in front of a vacant apartment, writing to you. I don't know what to do. I've tried every possible plan I could think of, and I always end up back on this damn street. 

I'm starting to think that this is the city's way of testing me. I always thought that the Trial was for outsiders; people who didn't know the city like I did. I thought that because I was born from the city, I was close to it. Comfortable with it. I was very wrong.

I think that this may be a consequence. All the times that I wished for somewhere quiet and secluded, the city could hear me. I came from it, and it was connected to my mind. It could hear my thoughts. My desires. My quiet wishes for escape.

It is angry with me. I know that now. This is my punishment. The city has me.

And it won't let me go.
