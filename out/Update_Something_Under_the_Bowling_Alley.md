I'm happy to report that I survived my shift today. Contrary to the 3am nightmares, I did not get dragged below the lanes by a ravenous creature and torn limb from limb. The league bowlers weren't too catty and I used a broom to fish out the stubborn balls. I refused to go near lane 9 and I think that paid off, but I do have some weird expereinces to note. Maybe they have something to do with what happened on Saturday. Maybe. 

The thirty-minute walk from the bus stop was brutal. I stumbled through the snow, back hunched, forehead bracing against the wind like a hull parting the waves. An endless bombardment of snowflakes forced eyes low, gaze locked on my boots. It remained there for a while, till I noticed a parallel line of tracks in the snow just off the road. They were a little larger than mine but more rounded, with a straight cleave down the centre. I'm no expert on animal tracks but I tend to look them up if I see them. I've found fox, rabbit, and deer tracks but this is the first time I've ever seen moose. 

To be fair, I'm not 100 percent sure they were moose tracks. They didn't look exactly like the pictures online. There was more weight in the back, but they  had that distinct hoove shape and were far too big to belong to a deer. Weird thing is we don't really get moose around here. Yeah it's rural Ontario, but the nearby woods is small in comparison to most and there are far too many noisy humans nearby. Then there's the other issue... As I kept trudging up the road, I watched the path of tracks gradually shift its shape. The rounded edges pulled back to form something elongated, slender, almost like a heel. 

Just as I was beginning to wonder if they'd been boot soles all along, I walked into the chain link fence that lines the back of the parking lot. The cold metal against my cheek sent a shivering jolt down to my toes. I pulled out my phone and realized I was already a few minutes late. Shit. My boss doesn't care as much as she probably should, but I wasn't looking to test her patience. I took another look at the tracks before running to the door and realized that they'd stopped. I could still see the last pair of them behind the gate, long, curved, and cleaved... but past the gate there was only a thick blanket of glittery snow, undisturbed save for my own reckless clomping.

Monique, my boss, welcomed me in with a rosy smile like she was unaware of my timing. I knocked the snow and salt of my boots, threw off my coat and waved hello to familiar faces as I rushed across the floor. In that instant my shift began and the chaos of the bowling alley swallowed up my focus, but there was still a part of me that lingered on those moose prints, or whatever they were. The snow was falling fast then... The prints couldn't have been visible unless they were fresh. 

The rest of the shift went okay. I was paranoid still, but something about Monique's maternal presence calmed me down. She must have noticed something was wrong because every time I disappeared behind the curtain, her protective gaze would patiently await my return. Walking down that narrow hall to the back section was a dizzying experience, and every now and then I'd nervously "catch" my own shadow slinking behind me. The edges of my vision seemed to twist if I stood in the badly-lit passage for too long, but suspicious shadows and murky vision were exactly what I expected after my hellish experience on Saturday. What matters is that I handled it. I'm kinda proud of myself for not just calling in sick. 

When Monique and I were taking inventory at the end of the night, I worked up the urge to tell her what happened. The lost ball, the hand in the darkness, the silhouette of something vaguely pink and vaguely round beneath lane 9... I gave her more details than I gave Jess, partly because I know Monique believes in ghosts. Before Saturday I couldn't be bothered to take her haunted house stories seriously, but now I was all ears. I asked whether she'd experienced anything supernatural at the bowling alley and her response was surprisingly blunt. 

"You've never heard the kid laughing?"

Well no I fucking haven't. I asked what she meant and she shrugged in the direction of the electrical room. "I wouldn't worry too much about it. Father Paul says that laughter is a sign of a good ghost. I think it's sweet that a kid chose to rest in the bowling alley. Maybe he used to come here."

I was much less comforted by the idea of a dead child laughing alone in an electrical room for all eternity. I couldn't even muster up the appropriate tone for my next question. "Have you ever seen it?"

She shook her head. "Never, and it's not my place to look."

Monique gave me a ride home later and we eaglerly talked about everything other than ghosts. But when I rested my head on the fogged-up window, I couldn't keep my mind off those prints in the snow. Monique noticed my fingers sliding over the glass. "It's still bothering you, isn't it?" 

"You said that laughing is a sign of a good ghost. Are there any signs of a bad ghost?" I took a peak at the road.

Monique thought about it for a moment. "Well yes, but ghosts don't usually take physical forms."

I squinted through the dark till we passed the well-lit bus stop from which I'd walked earlier. Despite the layers of snow that had built up over the last six hours, there they were: hoove prints crisp as ever along the side of the road.

I tried not to look alarmed, to focus on Monique's words. "If it's not a ghost then... what else could it be?" 

She shook off a noticable tension in her shoulders. "Anything else that moves but isn't alive."

So that's what I was left with. Hope this update is sufficiently interesting. I work this Thursday but I won't post again until something happens. Or... If something happens. I have a lot riding on that "if."

(I have a drawing comparing regular moose prints to the ones I saw, but I don't think I can post it here. If anyone has any ideas on how I can share it, please let me know)
