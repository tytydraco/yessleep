\[Sunday Evening\]

I'm still in the hospital. It’s been about 3 days since my original post and I am a bit concerned.

The doctors said something was off with my bloodwork and wanted to keep me a bit longer. Run more tests. I’m sure it’s nothing but it’s still concerning. Grandpa’s death, monsters are real, and now this. A guy can’t get a break.

Luckily, Josh still comes to see me. If not him. Nobody would.

Sorry, I don’t mean to be so depressing.

There’s a reason why I am posting again. Some nights I wake up in a sweat and swear there’s someone in the corner of my room. Standing there like it’s waiting for me to do something but when I do it’s gone.

My first instinct after what happened before is to… Well, honestly, stab it and see if candy falls out.

Tonight, I have a plan. I am gonna pretend to sleep so that I can jump it and hopefully figure out what it wants or what it is.

I will tell you how it goes.

&#x200B;

\[Monday, after 8:00 am\]

&#x200B;

It went terribly. I was laying in bed for hours pretending to be asleep. Almost actually fell asleep. I didn’t but I saw it from the corner of my eye and pounced straight into a wall.

Hurt like a bitch. Wasn’t all bad though at least Josh will visit today.

&#x200B;

\[Monday, around 2:30 pm\]

&#x200B;

“You’re an idiot”, Josh said.

“A functional Idiot” I corrected him.

“What’s functional about running into a wall to chase Casper?”

“You sound like you don’t believe me. Do you gotta show you the knife thing again?” I outreached my empty hand and summoned the knife out of thin air.

“Stop. You have shown me that 100 times by now. I get it but magical knives and dogmen are one thing. Ghosts? God honest ghosts?” he asked.

I looked away to the window murmuring. “It’s not that unbelievable”

“Alright.” He said, sounding dejected. “What’s the plan?”

&#x200B;

\[Monday night, past 11:30\]

&#x200B;

It’s surprising how empty hospitals can be. The bustle of nurses and doctors all but die down to a few select times or in case of emergencies. It was almost too easy to sneak Josh in after visiting hours

He came toting in with a dark blue duffle bag slung over his shoulder.

“You got the stuff?” I asked.

A puff of air escaped his mouth as he let the duffle bag drop to the floor. “yeah. .. You sure this stuff is gonna work?”

Unzipping the duffle bag. “pretty sure”.

“How’d you know?”

“I saw it online”

Josh looked at me for a solid 10 seconds. “Excuse me?”

I pulled out a couple canisters of salt, a pure iron crowbar, holy water, cruefix, and random bits and bobs of silver.

“This should be enough.”

We went back to my room and waited in darkness till...

&#x200B;

\[Tuesday 12:03 am\]

&#x200B;

Eyes like daggers staring into my back. It was enough to rip anyone from their slumber.

My phone read 12:03 AM as I braced myself. "Hello" I turned to meet its gaze. Its eyes weren't visible in the shadows but I couldn't help feeling a coldness. A coldness that comes with death.

"Now" I said.

Josh sprung from the behind the curtain and threw the salt on the floor around it."Gotcha"

The shadowy figure did nothing but stand there till it stepped forward on top of the salt. "Crowbar!" I shouted as he swung right through the spirit.

It grabbed his shoulder and sent him flying against the door.

"Fuck." grappling for the crucifix and holding it up."Stay!" The ends of the crucifix started to bend and snap off.

Gripping the hilt of a knife lurching forward as the sound of wind slashed by a larger blade filled my ears. The clanging sound of metal on metal."What?"

My knife is holding its ground to a scythe 10 times its size.

The sparks flew as neither of us gave up an inch and that's when I saw it. A pair of blue eyes looking back at me.

Human eyes. Eyes that were so gentle looking despite everything going on.

She slammed me with the butt of the scythe into my ribs causing me to fall to the ground.

The blade of the scythe was to my throat. She pulled off her hood revealing a woman my age with bright red headphones over her ears.

Removing her headphones. "How did you see me?"

"...What?"

"Only the dead or on the edge of death can see me. You are neither."

"So you're not here to kill me?"

"No. Why would I do that?"

A few seconds of silence passed till Josh came running up splashing a bottle of holy water on her face.

Nothing happened except a silent passive aggressive anger directed Josh's way.

"I don't think she's a ghost. Josh."

"What is she then?"

shrugging with the scythe still an inch to my throat.

"Jenny." She said, "My name is Jenny."

"Ok..." Josh said

"Um, Jenny. Can you remove your scythe from my neck?" She pulled back. "Thank you."

"Are you Death?” I asked her after getting back to my feet.

“No no no, flattering really. I am just a reaper.”

“Ok…”

“Is he okay?”

“Josh? Yeah. He’s just processing.”

“Yeah…”

“See, he’s fine.”

I turned on the lights and gestured to the chairs by the window. She sat down by the window but Josh elected to stand.

“So, Jenny” She looked up towards me.” Why are you here?”

A slight confused grin. “Working. This is a hospital after all”

Nodding. “So, why are you watching me?”

She paused for a few seconds “You know…Just making my rounds.”

“Umm hmm”

“Hey!” Jenny said . “How can you guys see me?”

“No idea. I have seen you everyday since I got here.” The look of realization hit her face. She pulled out a cellphone and then sloped her hands in her face. “Idiot Idiot”

“What’s going on?” Josh said.

With a deep breath she said “Nothing…I just forgot to turn on the filter.” Clicks a phone on her phone and vanishes.

“Where’d she g…” She reappears in her seat. “Invisibility. Nice right?”

"Very."

I gave him a side glance.

"What?"

Smirking. "Nothing."

"You two alright?"

"Never Better."

"Yeah, Never Better."

We spoke for a bit longer before Jenny had to return to work. The casualness of all this was pretty humorful looking back at it. Almost like three friends having everyday conversations.

&#x200B;

\[Tuesday 9:14 am\]

&#x200B;

I woke up to my nurse and other hospital staff checking the dent in the door.

"What happened?" I said.

The staff wasn't sure what happened and I played dumb. Later on, I heard the hospital checked the security cams. Found nothing but constant static and couldn't verify anything.

I had a feeling the hospital or more so my Doctor Sanchez felt sorry for me.

He came to me one day and dropped a bombshell.

My bloodwork doesn't look good and they're running more tests to find the problem but if it continues I will die.

I'm gonna die.
