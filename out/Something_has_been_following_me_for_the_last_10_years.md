\[Part 1\]:  
It’s been at least 10 years since the first time I saw them, or more accurately “it”. It was July of 2013, I was barely a teenager at the time. My life wasn’t exactly out of the ordinary to begin with, until it appeared. Up until this point, I’ve not idea why it chose me as it’s target. It was Wednesday when it moved in to the house located opposite to my childhood home. At first, it looks like an ordinary married couple, a happily married couple even. “Mrs. Smith” looks like she was in her mid 20s while “Mr.Smith” has the body of a man in who has just celebrated his 30th birthday. I was shy and introverted throughout my childhood so it took my parents a while to convince me to greet our new “neighbour”. The married couple was lovely, we invited them to our dinner. My father spent the entire night to brag about his new car while my mother “interrogated” them about their marriage. I sat there, silently finishing my plate so I can quickly leave the table. The dinner greeting went on for about 30 minutes until I felt a strange sensation, a feeling out being watched. Naturally, I looked up, and that’s when I caught the wife staring at me. She didn’t exactly turn her head towards me, it was more like an intense side-eye, with the grin still on her face. The staring went on for a solid 10 seconds until my mother pulled that woman’t attention away from me. I was confused, scared with a mix of curiosity but quickly brushing it off as some form of prank. But it only escalates from here.   
A whole week passed by without any incident, I was at my room playing video games, and that same sensation quickly poured over me, the feeling of being watched. I checked my room for anything that can cause this feeling. The search ends with me looking outside my window, directly to my new neighbour’s front yard, where the so called “married couple” is standing motionless and staring at my window. On their faces were the biggest grins that human can possibly make. I was utterly terrified so I did the most logical thing 13-year-old me could do: close the curtain, check if every entries to my house are locked and trying to sleep. I’ve decided that I wouldn’t tell my parents about their bizarre behavior since they arrived that seemingly targeted towards me only. Can you imagine telling your parents that your friendly neighbour were actually being a bunch of absolute creepy motherf\*ckers that stare into the room of a 13-year-old, no way they would even believe it. That wasn’t the first nor the worst experience I’ve had with them while I still at that hometown. Several times I woke up to dead animals being thrown in to the porch,some times they would throw rats, other times it would be bigger animals like dogs or cats. These animals usually don’t look like they were killed by any physical way. My parents obviously don’t even consider our new neighbour to be suspects. Their odd behavior had never significantly affect me in any way other than creep me the f\*ck out and they had never behave this way to any members of my family other me. There are also no pattern to what or when they would behave this way, 90% of the time the would behave like a standard married couple even around an defenseless and vulnerable me. I thought that I could just ignore them and they’ll stop, but that’s not what happen.   
A whole month passed by since the last time they did anything out of ordinary. I was convinced that this was when they gonna stop semi-harassing me with these random pranks. I was dead wrong. It was 12:00 PM at time and my parents were not home, I was downstair to drink some water. When I came back to my room, I heard knocking from my bedroom window. My bed room were in the second floor, so I thought it was some kind of bird that make the noise. And so I ignored it. A whole 30 seconds later I realized that I can still hear it, not only that but they seems to be following a certain pattern, which rules out the possibility that this caused by an animal. My stomach tightened from the realization. I quickly ran out of bed and staring at my window, or more accurately the curtain that was covering it. My head was trying to comprehend what could possibly make this sound. My palms were full of sweat and my legs are shaking from fear. And in the meantime, the knocking on my window is still there. A minute inside my bedroom that night felt like an eternity. I imagined all possibilities of what could have been causing that sound, from the most logical to the most unbielievable visions of the being outside my bedroom window appear at the same time.   
\- I can do it – I whispered to myself.  
Every steps I took towards towards that window curtain, my heart was racing and my mind was filled with uncertainty and fear. My feet was so heavy, like it was bound to lead. When I finally grabbed my curtain, my heart felt like it was gonna bust out of my chest. The sound of knocking got louder and louder as I got closer.  
\-You can do it – I whispered to myself again, this time louder.  
I shut my eyes and yanked the curtain open. The sound stopped, right when the curtain is moved away to reveal my closed window. A sense of relief mixed with fear flooded over me. My mind came up with the most horrific monsters that a 13-year-old could possibly imagine. My heart temporarily slowed down. My eyes peeked open, only to find nothing, absolutely nothing outside the window. There was not animal, no rocks being thrown, not even a breeze. Out of all supernatural beings and crazy monsters that I could imagine outside that window causing that sound, the most terrifying outcome is instead: nothing. It could have been a 6’10 serial killer hanging from rooftop and it would be less terrifying than this, because at least I can comprehend the source of a sound and how it could disappeared so quickly when I yanked the curtain open. I quickly looked down from my window to see the next door couple dancing from their bedroom window. Although they looks like a they never dance before in their life, seeing the next door couple be normal for once is such a calming view. It distracted me from the most terrifying and mysterious phenomenom just happened half a minute ago. I calmed myself down and lie down trying to get some sleep. Although I stayed awake until 3:00 AM, it’s still a miracle that I could even fall asleep that night.   
Our family moved out from that hometown after 6 months since the couple's arrival to give us a better life. For almost 3 years after we moved to the city, nothing out of ordinary happened. Nothing until a recently married couple moved in next to our house. Nothing until the dead animals started to be thrown into our front yard. Nothing would be our of ordinary if the couple didn’t motionlessly stare into my bedroom in the middle of the night. Everything was normal until I heard knocking from my bedroom window, again.
