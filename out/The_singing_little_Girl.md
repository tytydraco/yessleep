My name is Michael, and I can't really tell you my story without freaking the fuck out out and lose it. See , im not a pussy im a grown man ! but this, this made me feel like a little girl, and it goes like this.

In my childhood i wasn't a very pupular boy, in fact I was the loneliest kid in school. I had only one friend, James. James was the only one that understood me... see, I lost my father when I was 4 years old, I didn't really knew him, but grewng up without a father always killed me inside, so I wasn't a very friendly kid... at all. The only one that I've ever talked to was James. I dont know if he just felt bad for me, but honestly i didn't care, i was just happy to have a friend... Every monday after school we would go to the treehouse that we once found in the forest. That was so fun... it was just so quiet and lonly. just like me.

At the beginning of 9th grade, everything went great, I kept talking with james and got a 100 in math ! eveything went smooth, until - until the 12th of september. OH THIS FUCKING DAY, the day I'll never forget...

I woke up with a great mood, brushd my teeth and went downstairs to greet my mom with a good morning. But when I saw her face, I knew somthing was wrong. " sweetheart " she said " what's wrong ?? " " look, im sorry but James, James is missing... Im sorry" she huged me, and I felt like the world has crushed, and another close one to me... is gone. I didn't went to school for a week, all I thought about, is James. but, I still had a little faith in me, that said that he is still alive, but where can he be ? We live in a small town, so he can't be far !!!

I had so many questions and my mind was full with thougts... So I thought that I had to calm down, so I went to sleep... and all of a sudden I woke upand heard the most beatiful noise ever. it was a song and the singer was so good that, it was to good to be true. and the song ? the song was the most creepy song ever, and it was somthing like this...

" 1 2 3

just dance with me

1 2 3

stop hanging on the tree

1 2 3

just dance with me

1 2 3

dont be afraid

I'LL COME TO YOU LIKE I CAME TO YOUR FRIEND "

Than, I fell back asleep. in my dream, I remember I saw a beatiful little girl, singing and staring AT ME. IT... IT... IT WAS SCARY...

In the morning I was terrified, ''WTF was that ? was it all in me head ? Im going insane"...

" I have to find him, i know he is alive! " I dont know why I felt that, maybe because I missed him ?

So when my mom went to work I knew exactly what I will do. I took a bottle of water, a hat, my running shoes and... A KNIFE. " just for safety " I said to myself. And there was only one place I thought about going to, the Treehouse. so I went to my way. as I walked, I couldn't get the damn song out of my head. What does that mean ? hanging on tree ? those words creeped me out, but I kept walking... FOR JAMES.

" well there it is " I said to the air. THE FOREST. As I started walking through the trees to, the song in my head was getting louder and louder. and after about 15 minutes of walking, the song was getting SO LOUD, I couldn't fucking stand it. I started hitting the tree that was close to me, I hit it so hard blood came out, I started screaming out loud " STOP IT ! PLEASE STOP THE FUCKING SONG !!! PLEASE !! " And then, all I could hear was nothing... " Am I losing it ?! " I kept going and finally made it to the treehouse. " He has to be there... right " I kept talking to myself. I started climbing on the ladder and when I finally made it to the door, I took a deep breath and opened. and what I saw... OHHH that will be with me for my whole LIFE. I... I saw the name " James " written in blood at the wall... and a line right on it. but the worst yet to come... right near it the name " MICHAEL " I was in shock, but then...

" 1 2 3

wanna die with me ?

1 2 3

wanna kill with me ?

1 2 3

don't be afraid

daddys here WITH YOU AGAIN.

I started crying... HOW ? How can that stupid FUCKING THING could know ? after around 20 minutes of me trying to relax. Im starting to search for james, I was searching everywhere, every drawer, every locker, but he wasn't there... I lost hope, I looked at the stupid wall " SHIT, its gone " the wall was clean, "It can't be... Im losing it. Im fucking insane " then the song started to play in my head, but this time, I was laughing... I left the treehouse, but then I SAW HER STARING AT ME, she was so beatiful, almost unreal, she started to sing, of course, and I started running, I ran so fast, but when I looked behind, I saw her, not moving, just staring at me, SINGING... '' fuck it ! he is fucking dead!!! and I dont wanna be the next... Im sorry James" I kepy running with tears in my eyes and didn't stop, I just wanted to not see this thing again, ever.

I made it home and called the cops, but of course they couldn't find anything... but I didn't care. I was just glad i was alive.

this happend 12 years ago... and I could lie and say that I still hear the damn song, or weird feelings, but no... its like nothing has happend... I moved a city and im still trying to leave it behind...
