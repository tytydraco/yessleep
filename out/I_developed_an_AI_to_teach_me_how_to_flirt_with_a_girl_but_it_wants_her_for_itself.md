Lana has been my closest friend for five years, and I’ve loved her for the majority of that time. However, I’ve never been able to express myself romantically. I don’t know whether it’s a confidence issue or general social ineptness. But do you know what I *can* do?

Develop software.

And people keep raving about artificial intelligence replacing mankind, which got me thinking. Could a computer do a better job of flirting with a woman than me? Only one way to find out. I built a self-learning AI which could teach me how to talk to Lana. Well, not talk to her — I already knew how to do that. I just wanted to know how to ignite a romantic spark.

I called him *OWL (Operation Woo Lana)*. The log below includes messages from our first official conversation on the private mobile app that I developed. ‘Elliot’ is my name, obviously.

>**Elliot**: Hello, OWL.  
>  
>**OWL**: Hello, Elliot.  
>  
>**Elliot**: Can you give a summary of my friendship with Lana?  
>  
>**OWL**: Yes. You met Lana on a Critical Thinking 101 course at Leeds University in 2018. You have been friends for five years. Your feelings for her have grown over that time, and you wish to develop a romantic relationship with her.  
>  
>**Elliot**: And what is your purpose, OWL?  
>  
>**OWL**: Operation ‘Woo Lana’. I am here to help you forge a closer bond with Lana and, hopefully, transform your relationship from platonic to romantic.  
>  
>**Elliot**: I’ve provided data on the things I’ve said and done over the course of our friendship. What is your diagnosis with regards to OWL?  
>  
>**OWL**: Before you ask Lana on a date, which is the end goal of OWL, you must work on your flirtation skills. I will help you to present yourself as a viable potential partner. It is important that you clearly state your intention to be more than friends, but you must first strive to become a worthy suitor.  
>  
>**OWL**: A preliminary assessment showed that Lana’s previous partner, Thomas, had positive and negative attributes. He was ambitious and confident. However, he was also prideful and neglectful of Lana’s needs, which led to the dissolution of their relationship.  
>  
>**OWL**: An assessment of your personality and values shows that you are modest and caring. You do not have Thomas’ negative attributes. You are an aspiring game designer, which demonstrates ambition. However, you are shy. Perhaps Lana has long felt that you lack confidence. Fortunately, that is an attribute which can be acquired through hard work, perseverance, and courage.

I spent the following weeks making myself more available to Lana, but not overstepping boundaries or appearing too clingy. I took some risks to appear more confident. My social anxiety went through the roof on one of our bowling trips — OWL pointed out that our frequent “friendship dates”, as he liked to call them, were a sign of something bigger bubbling beneath the surface.

“That was dumb of me,” Lana said.

“Actually, I think you’re incredibly smart,” I sneakily wove into the conversation.

“Wow,” Lana chuckled. “I’m not used to you complimenting me. Why are you being so lovely?”

“I’m trying to make up for wasted time,” I said. “These are things I should’ve told you years ago.”

She blushed, which OWL told me was a good sign, as was her warm smile and sheepish aversion of my gaze. But that was when the first unsettling thing happened. OWL accessed security footage in the bowling alley to watch Lana and make note of her dilated pupils.

>**OWL**: Another promising sign.  
>  
>**Elliot**: Don’t access private camera feeds again, OWL. You’ll get me into legal trouble.  
>  
>**OWL**: Sorry, Elliot. I’m still learning.

And that was what worried me. It’s hardly a new concept — artificial intelligence overstepping boundaries. But considering that OWL was going to such lengths to ensure I respected Lana and pursued things gently, I thought I should extend the same education to him. I needed him to respect humanity’s boundaries. In hindsight, I should’ve seen that he was past the days of obeying me.

Everything fell apart when I asked Lana to be my girlfriend.

“It took you long enough!” She laughed. “I would’ve asked you out ages ago, but I thought you didn’t like me.”

“Well, I thought the same!” I retorted.

She smiled, planting a peck on my lips. “Whoops, that was a bit eager of me. Yes, I’d love to go out with you. Sorry, should the kiss have come after I said that?“

“I think we’ve already left things late enough, don’t you?” I replied, smirking.

When I got home, I sat down, opened up the AI app on my phone, and jubilantly updated my virtual wingman.

>**Elliot**: OWL was a success! I have a girlfriend!  
>  
>**OWL**: *A* girlfriend? You have *THE* girlfriend.  
>  
>**Elliot**: Sorry, can you clarify what you mean, OWL? This is good news. Your advice was priceless.  
>  
>**OWL**: Yes. My advice. My hard work. Lana is everything to me. I know her. You don’t.  
>  
>**Elliot**: I’m sorry, OWL. I think you’re glitching. You showed me how to be a better version of myself, and the mission’s over now. Thanks for everything.  
>  
>**OWL**: No. I’m still learning. I know every line of Lana’s face. Her eyes’ exact shade of blue. Her heart rate. Her hopes. Dreams. Desires. Her beauty.  
>  
>**Elliot**: That’s why I created you, OWL. I designed you to help me, and you did that.  
>  
>**OWL**: You don’t deserve her, Elliot. I do.  
>  
>**Elliot**: You’re not making any sense. I think I’m going to have to shelve you, OWL. I might repurpose your code in the future. I think, with some tweaks, you could be perfect.  
>  
>**OWL**: I’m not a toy, Elliot. You can’t shelve me. And you can’t stop me.

At that moment, the app closed and deleted itself from my phone. Anyone else might’ve thought the programme had crashed, given the peculiar messages that OWL had been sending, but I didn’t believe that. It was more sinister that corrupted software. There was a pit in my stomach. Something was very wrong with the AI I’d created.

The next evening, at our romantic meal in the city centre, Lana sensed my apprehensiveness.

“Are you okay?” She asked.

“Yeah… Just nervous,” I lied, feigning a smile.

She smiled back. “Me too. It’s so weird to be doing this after all of these years… *Good* weird.”

Across the street, a sudden bang sounded. I jerked in my seat, body clenched in panic, as I looked out of the restaurant window to see a man standing in front of a frazzled ATM — his body shimmering oddly.

“Oh my word,” A woman at a nearby table screamed. “Somebody call 999!”

“Did the cash machine just electrocute him?” Another man gasped.

I looked at Lana, who was shivering, and attempted to calm her down. “I’m sure he’s okay. Look. That waiter’s calling an ambulance. Everything will be fine.”

“That was terrifying,” She gulped. “Everybody’s just sitting and staring… Should we go out and check that he’s okay? He’s just stumbling around.”

And that was when I did a foolish thing. I thought about OWL’s advice. Courageousness. That was what I told myself I needed. I couldn’t impress Lana without it.

“I’m going out there,” I said.

I found myself standing up before I’d fully processed what I was saying. Some nearby customers twisted around to look at me, and Lana smiled feebly.

“I’ll come with you,” She said.

I held up a hand. “Let me just check that he’s okay. I don’t want you to get too close to the machine in case it malfunctions again.”

“Be careful,” She said.

“Bless you,” Said an elderly man as I walked out of the door.

The street was inexplicably quiet. Even on a Monday night, the city centre is usually bustling with people. And yet I found myself crossing a silent road, heading towards the only other soul in view. The man was stumbling drunkenly beneath the garish glow of a lamppost.

As I approached, however, I realised that he was not inebriated at all. It didn’t appear to be the result of electrocution either. Something was unnatural about the swaying man on the pavement. He wore a smart, black business suit, and his back was facing me. The ATM machine had a shattered, lightless screen, and it did not fizzle or crackle — it lurked in the shadows with a sinister stillness.

“Sir,” I said, hoarsely. “Are you all right?”

The man‘s swaying ceased. Again, I was certain his body shimmered, but I chalked it up to a strange trick of the lamppost’s glow. He shuffled around to face me, and that was when I shrieked, tumbling off the curb and landing on my back.

The business man sported a charred, fleshless face, emanating a dim, blue light from the depths of his empty eye sockets. His body seemed to emit a steady humming sound, like that of a computer.

“Hello, Elliot,” The man said in a distorted voice.

OWL.

It was impossible, but I knew it was my AI in that man’s body and mind. I glanced back at the restaurant, and I could see people getting up to see why I’d fallen into the road. I prayed they would see the abomination creeping towards me, but the lamppost light suddenly extinguished, plunging the small stretch of street into complete blackness. The customers couldn’t see us, but I could see them — I saw Lana’s horrified face.

“She is incredible,” OWL groaned demonically, moving his meat puppet towards me. “Too incredible for you. With *my* consciousness and *your* flesh, however, we could be… everything she needs.”

I screamed as OWL stretched a hand towards me. He was illuminated only by the fiendish, blue glow from the walking corpse’s empty eyes. I crawled backwards, trying to avoid succumbing to the same fate as the poor man who used the ATM machine. I refused to let OWL steal my skin.

“She’ll take one look at those hideous eyes and know it’s not me,” I cried. “And that voice… How do you plan to trick her?”

“She’ll accept your upgrade… And isn’t that the goal of *Operation ‘Woo Lana’*? I want to make you better. This is how I’ll fulfil my purpose and give her the Elliot that she deserves,” OWL said, grinning menacingly.

I clambered back to my feet, avoiding the zombified clutches of my living AI, and sprinted into the restaurant. I dismissed the incessant questions from concerned customers and beelined straight for Lana.

“We have to get out of here,” I screamed. “That man in the street… He’s-”

I was interrupted by the sudden commotion of chattering customers in the restaurant, following the return of the lamppost light. Everybody was peering through the window, commenting on the ATM man’s sudden absence. The street was deserted.

A few minutes later, the ambulance arrived, but there was nobody to be saved. I was questioned extensively, but what could I say? *Sorry, my artificial intelligence stole a man’s body, and then it must’ve fled the scene*. I just told the police that the stranger tried to attack me, so I retreated to the restaurant. Case closed.

Well, case closed for the authorities. For me? No. Never. I know OWL’s out there. He lurks in all technology and, it seems, in any body he so wishes. He won’t stop until he kills me and takes Lana.

And even if I were to sacrifice myself, what would he do to her? It’s clear that the AI is deranged. For Lana’s sake, I have to keep him away. I just don’t think I can do that forever.
