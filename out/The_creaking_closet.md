I lay in my bed, staring at the creaking closet in front of me. I knew something was in there. But I'm not sure what.
My dad didn't believe me, though. I had to prove it to him that something was there, I just didn't know how as the creaking stopped when my dad was around.
"Come out of there, or leave me alone!" I shouted.
No answer. Just that horrible sound. 
Creak.

The next morning, it all stopped, like it does every morning. I checked it, nothing once again. I wouldn't dare check in the closet at night time. You never know what could happen or be in there.

It's been going on for 3 months now, no nights where it stopped. It's every night; but I told my dad on the 3rd night but he said "it's just the wind don't worry" but my room has a window that I never open and my room door is shut so how could it possibly be wind?

This morning, I didn't eat the pancakes my dad made me. 
"What's up? Not hungry?" My dad asked.

 "Not really." I sighed 

"What's wrong? Something is clearly wrong this morning, you can tell me." My dad said

"You won't believe me though dad that's what I mean!" I shouted

"Tell me!" Said my dad with an angry tone.

"It's the closet! It never stops creaking! But obviously to you, it's the stupid wind, right? It's been 3 months. 3. I've had many sleepless nights with last night being one of them." I shouted as I stormed to my unsafe room.

Tonight is the night I check my closet. I'm tired of this because whatever is in there, if it kills me or whatever, maybe it will prove to my dad there is really something in there. I lay the note down on my bedside cabinet that I had written for my dad to see (if anything happens)

It said: dad, I've written this note to let you know that I checked my closet tonight, and if it doesn't end well, then here's where I am. Dead or whatever. But here's proof something actually was in there.

The clock struck 11pm. Bed time for me.
I walked up to my room, sweating and shaking.
I lay in bed waiting for the creaking. But normally nothing happened till 12am. If I'm un lucky 11:30. 
The clock read 12am.
Creak.
My eyes watered, my mouth went dry. My palms were sweaty but what could I do? I had to figure out what was in there or I would be living with it my whole life.
After a lot of time and courage I stood up and walked up to the quarter open closet. I peered through and revealed my eyes to darkness. I stepped back and remembered what I was stood here for. I stepped forward and then I slowly placed my hand on the doorknob to my closet and closed my eyes. I slowly pulled the door open.
Creak.
