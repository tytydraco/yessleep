Ok Reddit so I’m on a throw away bc my new roomie, longtime BFF sometimes trawls reddit for new drama and it’s been a while since I knew them well enough to know for sure which subreddits they’d frequent and that's kinda why I’m here… (btw forgive me if I misuse like reddit slag and stuff I dont really come here often and I know different sites and subs all have their own cultures but after my ex took the discord server with him in the break up and I moved… What can I do?) I don’t think they’d pick this one.  But they are NOT the friend I thought they were.  That’s NOT to say I’m not grateful for everything they’ve done for me because like I would probably not be here to even complain about dishes and trash if they hadn’t had a spare room but… Hold up I’m rambling, let’s go back to the beginning.

About two months ago I ended things with my fiance.  We were living together, we had set a date and were planning a wedding, and everything was roses and love until it wasn’t.  There were some red flags but you know how those just look like normal flags until your betrothed chucks a vase at your head in front of the wedding planner and you get a concussion and while you’re in the hospital they take your rose colored glasses off? Yeah.

So I’m NOT engaged. And what’s worse? The house was in his name because his credit was way better so I needed somewhere to land after getting my shit out of our shared house.  Cue my middle school BFF, April, she reached out because her roomie just moved out and even left a bed and some other random furniture behind I can use… Seems ideal right?  And I feel kinda like I’m whining since she’s kinda my savior here letting me stay rent free until I get a job out here and even sharing her weed.  But that’s where all the good stuff ends. Because this is the WORST apartment I have ever lived in and for all that she was my best friend in middle school and we’ve stayed friends since I feel like I barely know this chick.

* There's the titular dishes issue, of course…  I’m trying, since I’m still job hunting, to keep on top of things.  But there were no clean dishes when I moved in so it’s a lot and some of them were pretty nasty… like MOLDY nasty 
* April used to be really nice, like didn’t kill spiders only took them outside nice but they have glue traps set up for the MOUSE problem and sometimes when one is like struggling and dying they’ll just watch it and kinda laugh
* All April does all day is smoke weed, spill the bong, eat take out and scatter the trash 
* There's this like fermented bread? Injera I think it's called maybe someone here can tell me bc I don’t think it's any good to eat the first time but is it tasty if it’s double fermented? Because we’ve got like four takeout plastic baggies double fermenting under our coffee table right this second and to be totally honest I’m a little scared to move them with how puffed up the bags are I kinda think it’s a threat display from the bread 
* And their room just smells bad but I’m not going in there so my constant cleaning efforts can do nothing to fix what is undoubtedly the worst mess of them all

Anyways I write all of this to kinda ground myself before the “house meeting” I’ve called about dishes and the mice because I can’t keep doing all the cleaning on my own like this.  They don’t really work either so if we just actually team up maybe we can get the filth under control a bit.

...

Oh god ok that went better? Worse? Way different than I expected.  April said they’d do something about the mice, but that they “couldn’t do dishes” and then we talked about our feelings and cried and I thought we were all buddy buddy again and we hugged and smoked together and it was feeling all nice and stuff…  Like we passed the bong and it was hitting smooth again since I cleaned the weird pink mold out again just before we talked but then…

It was so gross ugh

Ok so after we hugged it out, after we reconnected and they agreed to handle the mice, after they swore things would be normal and they would be a real help again starting NOW… And maybe I’m just whining?  They did kinda imply they were just helping out extra to take the load of cleaning off my shoulders… Anyways, the gross stuff: They grabbed one of our big popcorn bowls and then gathered up all the glue traps, there were like 15 of them and a few were at double occupancy, and pulled the mice off one by one and dropped them into the aforementioned bowl and vanished into their room.

Some of those mice were like MOLDY reddit I shit you not they were DECOMPOSING in our cabinets where they stored their mixer and other like less used cooking equipment… They’ve always been like witchy, is there some kind of like wicca nonsense that needs rotting mice? When we were about to be freshmen they needed a vial of gravedirt so we snuck into a graveyard so maybe it’s something like that?

Idk guys my apartment is gross and my friend is weird and now my head hurts and I still feel like I’m gonna hurl after seeing all those dead mice so I’m just gonna go to bed and if April pulls anything else weird I’ll be back.

Wait actually you know what hold on, they “can’t do they dishes” allegedly, because of how the “sound of running water gives them a headache” but as I’m typing this they’re taking like their NINTH shower today which is steaming up the whole bathroom and the hallway and they’re NOT running the fan so i’m gonna have to wipe down the tile if I don’t want the bathroom molds to spread even more so scratch that theres just one more fucking thing before bed so since I can’t scream in this apartment building, if you can go into the woods where you are and let out a good long primal one for me please do.
