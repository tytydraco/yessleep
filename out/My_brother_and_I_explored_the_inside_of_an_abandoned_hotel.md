Last summer, my parents took my brother Aaron and I on a family holiday to Spain. It was something my parents had been planning for a while, but wanted to keep it a surprise for us kids. Aaron and I weren't told about it until two days before we were due to leave. We were ecstatic to leave our home in Scotland and trade in a couple weeks for some sunshine and hot weather.

Two days later we were at the airport eagerly awaiting our flight. It had been years since we went anywhere as a family because it's difficult finding someone to watch our pets. At least, when you have eight dogs, it is. After arriving at our destination, Mom picked up a rental car and we were on our way to the hotel we would be staying at. We didn't do much on our first night other then unpack and go out to dinner. Just before tucking into bed early, we all agreed to meet in the lobby the next morning at 10.

The next morning came and I was the last to arrive. I didn't know what was planned for the day but Aaron and I followed our parents to the car and got in. I asked where we were going, but all I got from Mom was, "It's a surprise." About an hour and a nap later, we stopped at what I thought to be the middle of nowhere. Just some empty land with a few trees and overgrown grass. I checked the time on my phone and saw that it was already close to noon.

Aaron looked just as confused as I was, until Dad said, "Mom and I bought this plot of land. It's ours." Dad was always talking about eventually buying a plot of land somewhere and fixing it up for different business ideas, but to be honest, I never thought he'd actually go through with it. Why in Spain, of all places? I swear I never understood that man. None of us did.

Mom stepped in and said, "I brought lunch with us so why don't you guys look around for a bit while I get everything set up and we'll have a nice picnic." As strange as it all was, I was still kind of excited. I mean, I know there wasn't really a whole lot to look at, but maybe I'd find something cool lying on the ground somewhere. I was even open to finding a nice rock to take home with me.

Aaron and I wandered around for a minute while Mom was getting everything out of the trunk. Before going too far, I caught a quick glimpse of some fresh strawberries- mine and Aaron's favourite, as long as they're accompanied with a yummy tart. Suddenly in the distance I saw what appeared to be an old building, but I was certain that there wasn't anything there before. "Aaron, look over there." I pointed ahead. "Let's go check it out!" He agreed, but reminded me not to keep Mom and Dad waiting too long.

As we edged closer, we realised it was another hotel. This one, however, was very clearly old and had been abandoned for quite some time. Vines covered the crumbling building. There was no telling how long it had been since it had seen any guests. I took my phone out so I could take a few pictures. I loved taking snaps of old buildings. The longer I stood there, the more I felt compelled to get even closer. I needed to see the inside. Aaron felt the same way.

What we saw after opening the doors to the hotel lobby was jaw dropping. Everything inside was in pristine condition. It was grand and luxurious and it was surely worthy of a 5 star rating. It was the kind of hotel that only the richest could indulge in. My brother and I were the only people inside. It was as if everyone just simply walked out. We couldn't believe it. I had to take more pictures.

We searched around for any sign of life, but to no avail. Suddenly, the elevator door opened with a ping signalling that it was ready for us to get in. You would think that getting on would be a bad idea, and it was, but as I mentioned earlier, I felt compelled to get in. Aaron and I slowly got in, and before we could press any buttons, the doors swiftly closed and took us to the first floor. It was when we got out that we smelled something delicious. We followed the smell until we stood in front of a set of swinging doors. Aaron stood next to me and we looked at each other before slowly pushing the doors open.

We were immediately hit with a mouth watering aroma. Inside was a busy dining room. Dozens of people sat at tables with friends and family while enjoying their meals. Smiles and laughter filled the room. Everyone was happy and lost in their own conversations. No one seemed to pay any attention to us as we made our way over to the buffet table. Everything looked heavenly. Aaron was almost in a trancelike state as he went to grab a fresh strawberry tart from the desert tray.

I quickly grabbed his arm. "Wait! Don't forget about what happened in the movie Spirited Away!" He shook his head and snapped out of his trance. "Let's get out of here," He said.

As we walked away, the room suddenly filled with music. It was quiet, but the melody was calm and relaxing; enticing, even. I wanted to get my phone back out, but I feard that if I didn't leave right then and there, I never would.

We spotted another way out on the other side and didn't waste any time getting the hell out of there. As the doors pushed open, the lights behind us went out. We turned around and suddenly the dining room was just as old and abandoned looking as the outside. The people were gone, the music was gone and everything was covered in dust. Being out of that room made me feel a little more like myself. We took the stairs this time on our way down and discovered that the lobby was also looking in pretty rough shape. The difference from what it looked like earlier was night and day. I wouldn't believe my eyes, had Aaron not been there to experience everything that I was. I took my phone out one more time and snapped some more pictures. An uneasy feeling swept over me and I knew it was time to leave.

We bustled on out of there and something felt... off. Like we had been in there for a long time, but I knew that was impossible. Aaron and I looked at the eerie, yet mysterious hotel one last time before making our way back to the car. In the distance we could see Mom and Dad frantically looking around for something. "What's going on with those two?" Aaron asked.

"Mom! Dad!" I called out. They started running to us. Mom was sobbing and Dad was panicked. Mom couldn't get a word out because she was crying so bad.

I'll never forget the sheer panic in Dad's voice when he yelled, "Where the hell have you two been? Your mother and I were worried sick!" Aaron and I were startled. I looked over at the picnic that Mom had so lovingly put out for us and noticed that the fresh fruit didn't look so fresh anymore. The cream on the strawberry tarts had lost its shape and spilled over the sides. The salad looked dry and withered. I checked the time on my phone. It was 8:32pm. "Aaron, look." I showed him the screen.

I felt sick. We couldn't possibly have been gone for more than half an hour. I couldn't even hear the yelling anymore. I was so dizzy I thought I was going to pass out. It took a good few minutes before I could even think straight. Mom and Dad started getting in the car and I begged and pleaded for them to listen. Aaron and I tried telling them about the hotel but Dad said that he didn't know what we were talking about. I pointed in the direction of the hotel but I couldn't see it anymore. Then I tried showing him the pictures I took on my phone, but they were gone, too. All of the evidence just vanished. Aaron went pale. I felt like I was losing my mind.

I think at some point, Dad must have finally heard the desperation in our voices. He gave us a hug and Mom kissed our cheeks, still crying. We got in the car and no one said a single word for the whole ride back. My parents put the land up for sale almost right after we got home.

They have just been given an offer.
