The intercom crackled out, leaving us with nothing. The voice was definitely a woman, but other than that I couldn’t place anything. We all stood there for a moment, looking to Jepsen since he was senior officer for the mission. He shook his head, sighing.

”I was about to say we just turn tail and get the hell out of here.” He mentioned, looking to all of us. “Unfortunately we were told to rescue any survivors that might be up here, and whoever that was just qualified. We’re going to Admin. If you’re too chickenshit, I ain’t gonna blame you, but go back to the ship. Last thing we need is another situation like Gates back there.”

”Sir.” All of us said, some more uncertain than others. I saw three of the remaining guys leave, making their way down the long, flickering hallway back to the ship. Part of me wanted to do the same, but the other was screaming that I need to find out what the hell I saw. That woman outside the window was… she wasn’t alive, that’s for damn sure, but how did she do that? It was really like a ghost coming right through the wall of the station, there one second and gone the next…

”Rest of you, with me. Remember what the voice said about acknowledging them.” He looked each of us in the eyes, one by one, making sure we understood. Our number was down to six now, a tight team going forward, and communication would be necessary for survival. Myself, Mullins, Stentz, Jepsen, and two other guys names Frond and Pierce. That was it. “If you see one, do not acknowledge, do not speak of it. We don’t know what we’re up against and we’re going to survive however we fucking can. Get this person out, and we’re done here.”

All nodded in agreement again, looking forward toward the Admin and living quarters wing of the station. It was dark, a small elevator at the end of the hall being our access point. Everyone filed in, crammed like damn sardines into a small compartment with no idea of where we were destined. As Jepsen came in last, he hit the button reading ADMIN, prompting the doors to close with a ding. The LED lights above us flickered, casting ominous shadows on the sleek white walls.

About fifteen seconds into the ride up, the elevator gave out, lights cutting off completely. 

“Dammit.” Stentz swore, turning on his flashlight and shining it around. I saw him freeze for a moment as the light glared off the walls, brightly reflected. Only seconds passed before the elevator lights came back on though, and we were moving again.

”There are seven of us.” Mullins mentioned offhand, voice steady but with an edge to it. I blinked, adjusting to the lights once more, and did my best to look without moving or causing a scene. From my spot in the back- left, I began taking note going clockwise- Stentz, Mullins, Frond, Jepsen…. Jesus Christ we’re not alone in here. There, right between Jepsen and Pierce, was a small old woman. Her skin looked like it would tear at the slightest tough, dark veins showing through against bones and atrophied muscles. Gaunt face framed by wild grey hair, she was missing her eyes just like the other one floating around outside. We all froze, making no note of the new party member standing around us, all desperately trying to ignore her to the best of our abilities as the elevator rose further.

I could see it in the eyes of the others too. Jepsen looked ready to crawl out of his damned skin, standing right next to the old hag. Every second of this elevator ride stretched to years, feeling like we would never be free. My breathing, despite every effort to keep it steady, began coming out in shaky gasps. The tight confines of the elevator were getting to me, and knowing that death was creeping just inches away didn’t help anything. 

“Once that door opens you file out slow and do not look back once we’re out, understood?” Jepsen said, all of us giving an affirmative. The hag was just standing there, a low whisper coming from her but it was too low to be intelligible. The lights flickered again, not quite going out, but still casting eerie shadows over all of us. The door dinged once more, opening wide into a small white hallway. I could feel the tension in my chest as I shuffled past when my turn came, doing my best not to brush against the old woman or pay her any mind. I don’t know that I’ve ever felt more free than walking out of those doors.

We just kept moving down the hall, not daring to look back at the still open elevator behind us. I could hear the doors slide close, or at least they start to, before something stops them, opening them back up. It continues like this every few seconds, something keeping the elevator up here and open. Was it the hag? Is she moving out after us? Oh god, she could be right behind me right now and I can’t even confirm without getting killed. Deep breaths. Almost there.

”Have you seen my son?” The voice came from right next to me. Old, raspy, like the speaker hadn’t touched water in years. I swear if I didn’t have enough discipline to keep my eyes forward I would be fucking dead. Fortunately for me, someone else didn’t have the same resistances I did.

”Son of a-!!!” Stentz barely got the words out before I could hear a pulse firing from his gun, barely scraping my shoulder as they went flying by. The idiot acknowledged it.

Warm blood covered me as he was ripped apart, head flying forward down the hall in front of us. I flinched as the spray of life force drenched my back, squinting to keep it from getting in my eyes. Stentz was gone before his head was able to even hit the ground, fear in his disembodied eyes ahead of us.

We keep moving though. Not much else we have a choice in doing, just pushing further down the hall toward the ADMIN sign at the end. There were various doorways all around us, open for meeting rooms, conferences, or just general presentations, I guess. Not that they were being used for that now. It looked like some of them had been abandoned mid-use, with projectors still running and computers on tables. There’s no telling how long they had been like this for, but it was like an eerie snapshot of a time right before disaster.

A small shadow ran through one of the doors as we passed, getting a reaction out of Pierce and Mullins. Our numbers drop by two as something unseen rips them into the door on either side, separating limb from torso and dragging them into the darkness beyond. Just the slightest interaction with it, the barest sign of acknowledgement, and these things would pounce on us like we were freshly prepared food placed in front of a starving prisoner. A child’s laughter echoed from the rooms around, sending a new shiver of terror down my spine. I felt like my feet were anchored to the ground by lightning for a moment before I force myself forward again, desperately clawing further along into this hell.

Jepsen, Frond, and I were all that was left, moving through the hallway and following the Admin signs. The design of this place was Kubrickian, just nearly endless halls twisting with rooms full of hell on either side. I think they know that we’re here. They must know that whatever veil between us and them is more likely to let them through right now. Screams echo through the hallways intermixed with laughter and shouts. They’re trying to break us, make us react. 

Our lighthouse in the storm was finally ahead, at the end of this labyrinth of halls was a small office room, window plastered off with what looked like aluminum foil and electrical tape. Reminded me of those conspiracy theorists you would see in videos back in the nineties, thinking everyone was trying to read their minds with microwaves and shit. The door opened as we got closer, safety beckoning us in.

As we ran through, I caught sight of our savior. A woman, probably in her mid-20s, with ratty brown hair and thick glasses. She stood back while we all crashed through the doorway, desperately throwing ourselves against the wall in relief of a safe place. Or what we hoped was a safe place, at least. 

The woman closed the door behind us, sizing us all up and reaching toward a gun on the table. Television monitors flickered from the corner desk nearby, switching between security feeds. It was hard to find a screen that didn’t feature a couple of dead, mangled bodies every time it switched views, some areas featuring mass piles of corpses that were well on their way to rotting.

“What the hell happened here?” Jepsen got out before she could say anything to us. She practically chuckled at that though, sitting on the table and staring us down instead. 

“Damn ghosts killed everyone, what’s it look like?” She spat back in a southern drawl. “The hell they send you bastards up here to die for?”

”Well, we were sent to rescue any survivors that were up here. Guessing you’re it?” I asked, taking a step forward. All she did was study me, gazing up and down. I saw her eyes stop where my weapons were, both the knife in my belt and rifle at my side, taking note of the best way to get them from me. She was a survivor, for sure.

”Only people on this shitshow deservin’ of rescue died a long time ago. You know where you are, right? What they sent you up here to?” She asked again, still sizing us all up. I moved to the window, tracing my fingers along the long, overlapping rows of electrical tape and aluminum covering the entire frame. She comes over to smack my hand away, “They like starin’ in windows. Don’t mess with that.”

”So what the hell are they?” Frond asked again, sitting back against the wall and closing his eyes. 

“Ghosts. That’s all I’ve got.” She shrugged again, sitting back on the table and pulling out a small notebook, jotting down words with a pen driven through the spiral coil.

”Alright.” I said, holding a hand up, “Let me ask a few questions just so I can… I don’t know, piece this crap together. Who are you?”

”Name’s Shelly. I was one of their pleasure girls up here.” She replies, looking over her notebook at me. 

“How long you been up here, Shelly?” I respond, leaning back against the wall.

”Since I was eight.” She says it so casually that it took me by surprise.

”You were… a pleasure girl? At eight? Jesus Christ.” Frond shook his head, Jepsen looking like his eyes were going to pop out.

”Oh honey, that’s not the worst they did up here. Seventeen years and I’ve seen plenty.” She was chuckling at this point, despite our horror. “The people up here… they didn’t see themselves as people. They were gods. Richer than you could ever imagine but that wasn’t enough for ‘em.”

”So you’ve been here seventeen years? When did all of this start?” I asked, trying to keep on track and get my wits about me. My sympathy for the ones that lived up here was already pretty low but now… nah, now it’s all about getting my ass back to solid earth. 

“First ones started maybe a year ago. Some of the older residents talking about people that weren’t there, then they eventually started appearing to more and more people all around the station. Every time someone took notice of one, that was it. Dead on the spot.” Shelly was rambling now, “Gotta say, it’s nice to have real people to talk to again. I was getting a little cooped up. Anyway, yeah, people started dying when they noticed the damn things, even floating outside the station.”

”There were a lot of bodies outside the station, just floating through space… all of those were ghosts?” Frond spoke now.

”Heaven’s no. Most of those were living people at one time. See, when people start getting ripped up by ghosts appearing, the others around kind of start losin’ their minds. Started shooting people out of the air lock as some kinda sacrifice to save their own asses. Not that it worked, mind you.” Shelly replied, chuckling again. “No, most of ‘em realized before long that we were all damned. It was just a matter of who could pretend they weren’t there the best. They called for help, too. Had some ‘experts’ come up.”

All of this was hurting my head. Over a year of shit like this going down and nobody thought to get the hell out of this place? Not that they sound like normal, rational people by any means, but still, it feels like an obvious case of knowing when to get the hell out of a place where you’re going to die. She just continued talking.

”They tried doin’ some kind of exorcism, a couple of little rituals to ‘cleanse’ the station and all. Poor bastards got torn apart piece by piece. Think the ghosts made sure they would stay alive to feel the pain, only time I’ve seen them last that long.” She finished scribbling in her notebook now, snapping it back shut.

”Did anyone mention anything about what caused it? Nobody had any kind of ideas?” Jepsen asked now. 

“None any of us could agree on. I know all the residents up here were pretty screwed in the head, so a lot of us figured hell just finally had enough of waitin’ on ‘em. Went ahead and sent a few of their victims to collect, y’know?” She said, looking to the rest of us. Sounded like as good of an explanation as any. “Course, you let Hell loose and it ain’t so easy to reign it back in. So most everyone ended up getting taken down along with these folks.”

”How the hell did you make it this long?” Jepsen asked, now looking right at the woman. She certainly looked like she had been through hell, but somehow here she was, the only survivor standing in front of us. 

“I got real good at going other places. Y’know, up here.” She pointed to her skull now, tapping her temple. “Whenever one of them pops into sight, I just go off like I would any other time until they ain’t there any more.”

Dissociation. Crude, but if it works, it works. Good thing to take note of. Not like I haven’t had my fair share of separation of mind and body during some PTSD episodes. She only smiled at us though, like she was unaware of what she’s gone through. The poor girl was obviously broken from her entire time up here, but it ended up saving her life in the end.

”So, we just need to make it back to the ship and get home. There are no other survivors, right?” Jepsen asked, looking her right in the eyes and nodding as if to get her to say yes.

”None I know of, no sir.” Shelly responds, shaking her head. The relief that flowed through my body was something I maybe shouldn’t be proud of, but spending even more time on this ship was something I wasn’t keen on doing. 

“Alright. Anything you need to bring with you, go ahead and grab it. Let’s get the hell off this can.” Jepsen nodded, moving forward toward the door. Shelly stood, shoving the notebook into a pocket on her pants. Frond got up, making adjustments to his gun before realizing it was useless, taking it off to leave behind.

”Not like they’re going to be affected. Why slow myself down?” He said, shrugging to the rest of us. Jepsen and I exchanged a look before nodding, taking ours off as well and throwing them on the table. If death comes for us, some shitty taser isn’t going to do a whole lot.

”Let’s go, then.” Jepsen opened the door, almost walking right into the thing standing right in front of it on the other side. It was a hulking man, bald, though it was hard to tell with a massive chunk of his skull and skin missing up there. I don’t know if it was just first reaction or if he tried to catch himself, but Jepsen simply let out one soft word before he was separated, something cleaving from his right shoulder all the way down to his groin, “Shit.”

His body fell in a crumple. Maybe the spirit that did it was satisfied with his kill, because it disappeared within moments after the body collapsed. 

“Son of a bitch.” I whispered, motioning for Frond and Shelly to keep close as we entered the hallway. “Shelly, if you can do that thing where you go somewhere else, take a hold of my vest and just follow, okay? They’ve played some tricks on our way in.”

”I’ll try.” She muttered. I could feel her loop a finger through one of the straps on my bulletproof vest, finally getting some kind of use up here. It honestly makes me want to laugh just thinking about how hilariously underprepared we were coming up here, with almost nothing working out in our favor.

The long, twisting hallways were the same as on the way in. I did my best to just tunnel vision myself forward, not paying any mind to the laughter and screams coming from the rooms on either side of us. Shadows would dart in between doors like a damned Scooby Doo chase every so often, trying to make us acknowledge them by nearly running through us. 

One finally got too close, though. Ran right through me as I passed in between two doorways leading back to the elevator. Felt like I went into a flash freezer, getting drenched in water before the fans were turned on max, icing me down right where I stood. I did my best not to scream, not to make any kind of sign that I felt the ghoul passing through my body. That would be the last time I was in one piece if I didn’t. 

I felt her hand on my shoulder, squeezing tightly and gently pushing me forward. Frond was behind us, silently whispering for me to keep moving. Come on, little by little, thaw out the ice and get a move on. Just have to get through the elevator and back to the ship…

I managed to get through, finding our way back to the lift after a few more minutes. The old hag from before was gone, thank heavens, but Frond and I knew what to be on the lookout for.

”Shelly, if you notice extra people in the elevator, don’t mention it, okay?” I whispered, trying my best to sound calm. The stars were twinkling out of the huge viewing windows around us as we waited for the elevator doors to open. She only nodded.

”They like to ride the elevator. I know.” Was her only response. The bells dinged, opening to reveal two people already standing in the lift, waiting on us. One was mangled, turned completely backwards at the waist yet standing at attention, spine obviously broken. The second looked like his neck had been yanked by a rope while he was falling at hundreds of miles an hour, barely hanging on and grotesquely stretched out. I could hear Frond hold his breath a little, but I simply stared straight ahead. Go somewhere else, anywhere else, and just get on the damned elevator. 

I stepped in, breathing in a stench of rotten death as I passed near them. Shelly followed, eyes distant and unseeing of what was in front of us. Frond was struggling though. He was stiff moving forward, trying his best to ignore the shadows of violent ends standing right in front of us, but unable to reconcile it in his scared mind. He began muttering a prayer under his breath, pleading with a god somewhere back on Earth or further out into the heavens to save him. 

He made it in, regardless, and I managed to push the button for the central atrium. We just have to play it cool. Close our eyes until the bell rings and we can step out of the lift. No problem…

As my eyes close the sleek white of the doors in front of me fades, a dark emptiness taking over. It’s almost freeing to not have to worry about what I might see when I open them again. Maybe I just keep them closed the entire way back to the ship…

“Pardon, do you know when the train arrives?” A voice in my ear brings me back to the present. My eyes remain closed, breath catching in my throat as I try to determine it. Not female, definitely not Shelly, and Frond wouldn’t be asking some nonsense like this. Hell, the voice sounded like a thousand broken fingernails scraping across a gravel path, not like anyone living. I should open my eyes…. just check and make sure everyone else is okay… 

No. Don’t open them. Don’t dare open your eyes. It’s those bastards that were waiting in here, trying to see if I’ll acknowledge them. Even opening my eyes might be taken as a sign. Just keep them closed, straight ahead, listen for the doors… 

DING.

I walk as fast as I can along the hall without missing a beat. Finally out of the elevator, I open my eyes to see that Shelly is still holding onto my vest while Frond is dry-heaving against the wall nearby. Through the darkness of the hall that the central atrium looms ahead, our last obstacle before finally reaching the way home. 

It was empty before.

I’m trying to keep my shit together the best I can, but I want to scream just looking at the entrance to the Atrium. It’s a straight shot through to get to the ship. Probably two hundred bodies packed shoulder to shoulder in there, all just milling about aimlessly. Soft whispers floated our way over the crowd, nonsense by the time they reached us. These were all phantoms, and if we paid the slightest bit of attention to any of them, we would join them. 

Frond… I think Frond just kind of broke when he saw that many. Can’t blame him, really. They ran the entire spectrum of man, woman, child, old, young, all suffering some gruesome affliction that put them here. Broken limbs, some completely dismembered or barely hanging on to the original body, were common throughout the room. Some were missing huge parts of their head, brain matter spilling out. That was just what i could see from here. I was trying not to look, not to notice, not to make them aware lest they come down on me like hungry predators starved of a meal. Shelly’s hand gripped my shoulder once more, nails digging in under the vest as her anxiety heightened.

Before I knew what was happening, Frond pulled a knife from his belt, running it across each of his eyes in quick slices. I’ve got to commend the dedication, but damn if I didn’t almost start screaming at him when I saw it. Effectively blind, he dropped the knife and held his hands up, working forward into the crowd.

All I could do was watch. He… he slows down a little before he actually hits the crowd, like when you’re worried about hitting a drop-off while swimming at the beach. Then he just plunged in, desperately making his way through the sea of death with teeth gritted. 

He made it through a few bodies before coming to a stop, screaming as he stepped through another one. Maybe it was the cold aura they gave off, just from how it felt standing near them in the elevator, but passing through them broke him, despite his inability to see it. He started screaming, hands lunging forward like he was grasping for a far off shore to stop his drowning. No use. 

The phantoms took his movements as an acknowledgement, the sea of death roiling as they all lurched forward to rip their reward from his body. Blood sprays into the air as his skull is cracked open, split like an egg and pulled from either side to fight for control of his quickly stretching spine. Frond was gone in moments, pieces scattered to every corner of the Atrium as the shades of life began to retreat back to where they originated from. 

Some disappeared, others stayed, meanwhile a few began wandering the atrium, now free of some of their brethren who were packing them in. I let out a deep breath, turning to look at Shelly before making our final trek.

”We have to walk through them.” I said, looking her directly in the eye to make sure she was there with me. She nodded.

”I’ve done it before. When you touch them though…. well, it ain’t like just passing through them.” She shudders, “It’s like you live it. What happened to them.”

”Well, we either do that or we stay right here and starve to death.” I said, taking a deep breath. Freedom was so close. A light out of this dark, death filled can. All that’s standing between us and that ship is a sea of the dead, and goddammit I’m going to cross it. I look at her, giving a nod that she returns. Time to go.

I know if I close my eyes they’re just going to find another way at me. I see them all right in front of me, dozens thick along the path to the ship, but there’s no other way to get around them. Deep breath… and first step. One foot in front of the other, Shelly with a hand tight on my shoulder as I guide us toward the goal. Before long I pass through the first phantom, giving it no mind as the cold overtakes me. It’s empty, and there’s a sudden hollow pit in my chest as they hit me. From the corner of my eye I see them, a man around my age, standing there. A huge hole was blown through his chest. I swear it almost felt like I could feel the wound coming through my own body, a huge round of munitions punching through me in an all too familiar desert setting. As soon as I saw it, the vision was over, leaving that hollow pit of despair behind for me to carry forward.

Every person I stepped through added to that feeling. The sheer weight of existence became overbearing, and I don’t know how long I’ve been going through the dead sea at this point. My dread was a physical weight holding me down, making my footsteps drag like boulders with every twitch of muscle. I feel so weak… like I’m going to just fall over and die at any moment, a dead body in this ocean of phantoms.

How easy would it be for me to turn back now? Just take a few steps back and rest at the elevator hallway… give this a try later, see if the phantoms thin out? Or I could just look one of them right in the eye. That would end it all fast enough, and make damn sure that I didn’t keep feeling this absolute loathing for life that had settled into the forefront of my thoughts. 

More visions battered me, mentally and physically. I was a woman beaten to death by someone she loved. I’m a teenager being hit head on by a car. An older man dying of a heart attack in the middle of his office, supervisor screaming as everyone just chatters on phones around me. Boom, a shot to the head from an over-eager hunter ends my life, just twelve years old.  Water pressing in from all sides, but my small limbs aren’t developed enough to fight back against the strong hand holding me under. Ten men hold me down, one beating me into the void of death as the others take advantage. Every single body I pass through shows me exactly how they died, mired in tragedy and violence, while I feel every last ounce of pain, anger, and sorrow they did at the time. 

I understand why they do it now. Why there here, still no idea about that, but I understand. When someone you go through all this violence on the way out all you want is for someone to notice. To say something. Just one person to step in and stop what’s happening. Now that they’re already dead, what good does noticing them do other than instill anger? It was too late now, anyway…

I’m a wife, beaten to death by a drunken husband. 

A young girl, left to starve by neglectful parents.

An old man, locked away rather than cared for as dementia took over.

Each life just reinforced my feelings that it was better to give up. Every spirit was closing in on me now, even as I stared forward, desperately trying to purge my mind of everything around me. Shelly was still holding tight to my shoulder. If I give up, she’s just going to be left here, stuck in the middle until the ship leaves or they tear her apart. The poor girl had already survived enough, she shouldn’t have it cut short by me being a chickenshit here.

I push through, seeing spectres on every side pushing forward, desperately trying for my attention. For a second I can swear they’re coming down from above me, desperate to take whatever little bit of attention I would give them and use it to rip me to shreds. 

We’re free suddenly. No more phantoms, no more ghosts, the oppressive hollow feeling from moments before was still there, but finally ebbing away bit by bit. We had crossed the river of the dead, and our ferry back to the world of the living was shining up ahead.

Flickering lights from up ahead told me we were close. I grabbed Shelly’s arm, pulling her as I sped up toward the airlock where the ship was docked. Before long we hit the hatch, banging on it to be let in by whoever was still on board. After a moment it hisses open, two of the soldiers who had left standing on either side, gun ready to fire if need be. 

The next few minutes are a blur, but I remember hitting the button to close the doors and screaming for the pilot to fly. The remaining soldiers had plenty of questions about where the others were, but I told them we just needed to get the hell out of here.

Naturally they didn’t just accept that, so I had to tell them that everyone else was fucking dead to get them to move. Bastards sat back here comfortable while I saw everyone get ripped to shreds and had the fucking audacity to question if I was telling the truth. Thankfully they were more inclined to believe Shelly, and she gave them the rundown of what our return trip entailed as we finally put that cursed place behind us.

Outpost Styx faded away as we began our flight back to Earth, the only survivor in our protection now. I don’t really care what’s waiting for us back on Earth at this point. Whatever they want to give me for doing this… ain’t fucking enough. Especially knowing the kind of people they sent us there to rescue now. God, who’s even going to believe me about what happened up here? Not like they weren’t counting on that when they recruited us.

A body floats past the window as I gaze out, staring off toward the sun far, far in the distance. I notice it wave at me, smiling through decaying teeth, crumbling off into the void of space. 

Don’t think I’m going to pay it any mind. Maybe if I ignore it, it won’t follow us back. [Maybe…](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/kHf4l8vQSu)
