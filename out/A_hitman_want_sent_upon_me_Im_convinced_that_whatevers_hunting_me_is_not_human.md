For some context, I was working for the government a while back. After working there for almost four years, I decided that I wanted to quit. The government is not what you think, it’s worse. I quit my job because the secrets of the government was too much for me. I can guarantee you that whatever you think the government is up too, it’s far more worse than the human mind can comprehend. There are many rules and conditions when working for the government. They’re all very simple to follow. Not following one of them could be the biggest mistake of your life. 

I made that mistake by sharing one of the governments top secrets in an interview. What made this event worse was that over half the world had seen it. The government had someone managed to contact me through some sources, whom I will not mention. Their message for me was clear. They wanted me dead. The government wanted me dead as soon as possible. At that point I was in my apartment laying in bed. It took me one hour to realise that I was in severe danger. So I did what any person would do. I went off the radar. I sold all my furniture and belongings, cut off any contact with anyone I knew and moved to another country. 

This detail is important later for later on in the story. I booked the first flight to Japan. And I stayed the night at the airport. At this point it had been exactly twenty-four hours since the message from the government. I had already suspected they hired a hitman or a bounty hunter to assassinate me, but the truth was so much more horrifying. When I arrived in Japan I rented a hotel and laid low for some time. I would rarely go outside as I was always inside hiding from whatever was after me. But I ran out of money as as a result, had to find a place to stay. I tried my best to stay hidden, but they found me. I was on the train when a man dressed in black approached me, “Hi! You wouldn’t happen to know the man in this picture?” He brought out a picture of me, how the hell did he find that? At this point shivers ran down my spine and I was sweating to the point where the man said “never mind, sorry for disturbing you.” 

I remembered who he was and how he looked like in case I ever encountered him again. 
I travelled halfway across Japan but the feeling that someone was following me consumed me. I couldn’t take it anymore. I wanted to flee from Japan. And that’s exactly what I did. Little did I know that would be the biggest mistake of my life. When I was boarding I can swear I saw the man from the train, but how? There’s no way he followed me to the airport. I saw him get of the train. I entered the plane and when I say I saw the man again, but this time as a flight attendant , my body stood frozen. All my life I’ve believed humans are the only species in the universe. After seeing the same man three times in a row I’m convinced that what the government sent to kill me is not human. 

I tried my best to remain calm, it was impossible. The same person had followed me around for god knows how long. Ever since that incident I rented a hotel to stay in, and my pulse stopped beating when I say that the receptionist was the man. Is my mind playing tricks on me? I must be going insane. I was unsure of what to do. So I mustered up the courage to ask for help from an old friend of mine. He told me I could stay in his house for a while. At this point I thought I was safe, I wasn’t. 

He mentioned how a new neighbour has moved in right next to his house. I was eager to meet this person but figured I was most likely staying at his house for a long time, so I may as well get to know the neighbours. He mentioned a family of four. But when I saw them. A man dressed in black followed by a wife almost identical to him, followed up by two boys who had the biggest grin I’ve seen in my life, their skin was pale. None of them showed any emotions. Until the man approached me and whispered “you can run, but you can’t hide from the government”.
