When I was growing up, I wasn't brought up into a Religion. I was aware of Them and I would admit, I was curious about Religion. But, I thought of Religion as more of a tool to keep people in line, to control people. And I lived most of my life falling under that belief.

But unlike most nights, I don't think I could forget this one. Even if I wanted to. Even if I didn't believe in God at the time, he made sure to let me know he was there.

I will try to keep this short. But here's my story.

When I was in my early teens, I was in my room playing video games with my buddies, as I had got a PS4 for Christmas. I was ecstatic, Since I was the last kid in my friend group to get a PS4. I hopped into a party room and played Call of Duty Black Ops 3 for the whole day since we were still on Christmas break. Just as boys around our age and I guess our age now we were saying some pretty obscene things and talking trash to each other. 

After playing for several hours, I decided to log off. I didn't realize how late it was and decided to go to sleep as I knew no-one else would be awake.

I laid my head on my pillow with me looking at my alarm clock reading 1:13 A.M.

But for some reason I woke up and saw my clock was reading 3:27 A.M.

I turned my head, observing my room. I didn't notice anything, and decided to go back to sleep. 3 minutes later, I heard the howling wind.  I got up and saw that my window was open. But, I knew all of the windows were closed before I went to bed as my mom told me earlier that day to keep the windows closed.

But, I wish that was the only thing I saw that night. In the corner of my room, closeted to my window.

There was a Black Silhouette, I could make out the torso of a human. But, the head of the Silhouette was far from Human. As my eyes grew and the adrenaline pouring into me. where the eyes of the Silhouette would be, two great balls of fire filled their stay.

I turned to my nightstand, opened the drawer, and fumbled for my pocket knife. I pointed the blade at the Silhouette. It widened its stance, releasing an ear piercing screech, and Lunged out of the window.

I got out of bed, ran toward the window slamming it shut.

I sat up straight in my bed, and I was terrified. My mind was racing trying to make sense of what just happened.

Then I noticed something on the wall; where the Silhouette was standing. I grabbed a flashlight and pointed it at the wall. It was writing, it was a written In what looked like ash. It would read, "EX 3:14."

I grabbed my phone and looked it up, It was a Bible Verse. "And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am."

My heart sunk, was that Silhouette God?

I was even more confused than ever. I looked at my clock, now it was reading 3:45 A.M.

I don't know how, but somehow I fell asleep.

I woke up at 7:32 A.M.

I thought what I experienced was a bad dream. But there was a new message on the same wall.

written in ash, it said "MTW 7:15." It was another Bible verse which said "Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves."

Somehow no one heard anything last night.

I didn't tell anyone what happened that night, and even if I told them, who would believe me?

What I saw that night is still a mystery to me to this day.

But, I know one thing for certain.

It was unholy.
