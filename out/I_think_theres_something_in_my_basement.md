I recently bought a house in Florida I won't say the exact place to stay anonymous
For information I live alone and far from any friends or family.
It was my first night there it was about 11 pm I was getting ready to sleep while I suddenly heard banging noises coming from downstairs I jumped out of bed to check what it was but the moment I stood up the noises stopped I tried looking all over the house to see where it could've came from but I couldn't find anything about after 10 minutes of searching I gave up and assumed it was just from the neighbor next door I woke up again that night at about 4 am I started to hear the banging noises again I assumed it was just the neighbor again and I told my self I would call the previous owner of the house(Jim)tommorow and ask if it was common to hear these noises.




I woke up the next day and called the previous owner we started talking a bit about how I liked the house etc...
The moment I started talking about the strange noises coming from downstairs the owner stopped talking he started mumbling and he sounded nervous I tried talking to him but he just stayed silent after a few seconds he hung up I tried to call him back afterwards but he didn't answer I was very confused but still didn't think much of it .







Later that day I went to talk with the neighbor(Mike)next door to check if the noise could've came from him.
I knocked on his door and he opened up with a smile and said "you're the new guy who just moved here right?" I answered yeah it's me he asked "so do you like the area so far?" I replied yes it's great here but I have a question to ask you he said "what is it?" It's about some noises I keep hearing, banging noises Mike's smile faded away instantly I knew something was wrong but didn't say anything ro not be rude, I asked is there a chance they're coming from your house Mike said "no but I used to hear them too, when Jim moved to your house a couple years ago every night I would hear those noises at some point I confronted him about it but he acted like he didn't know anything I tried calling the police once but the they didn't do much just gave him a warning. sometimes these banging sounds would turn into screaming but it was only on rare occasions" I was surprised to hear all of this I was even more scared than before I thanked Mike for telling Me this and I wished him Goodluck Mike said "look before you leave I gotta tell you i don't know what Jim did there at night but I can tell you that whatever caused those noises is still there and Jim moved away because it started to be a too big of a problem for him to handle"
Mike closed the door.
I walked back home feeling scared for my life every thought about this house made me nervous it was already 8 pm and I knew these noises would come back soon I sat on the couch on my living room thinking what could I do to solve this after an hour of thinking I decided to follow the sound and check where it comes from.


I was sitting in my bed when the time turned to 11 pm I was ready for the noises but nothing happened, I was laying confused on my bed, asking myself why didn't it start I told myself maybe it wouldn't happen today and I got to sleep,
I was about to fall asleep when I suddenly heard screaming coming from downstairs it wasn't like any screaming I heard In my life it was too loud for a human to even make this noise I followed the sound downstairs into the basement door, the basement door was 2.5 meters in height and 2 meters in length the thickness was 6 inches it was made out of steel I never understood why would anyone need such a big door but the inhumane screaming made me think it should be like that I got close to the door the loudness was getting unbearable the moment I touched the door handle it stopped I tried opening the door but it was locked and there's no way I could open this thing by myself without the key, I just stood there feeling defeated when I started hearing laughter from the basement I couldn't handle it anymore I went outside the house and slept the night in my car.



I woke up at 12 pm way more late from the times I usually wake up at, I was tired I guess I got out of the car to see the newspaper waiting outside my door I told myself I'll get my mind of this house by reading a bit I opened the newspaper to see a picture of Jim on the front, below it said "local man killed himself for unknown reasons by shooting himself with a shotgun" I was shocked but before I could react a police car parked outside my house a cop came out of the car and approached me he said "did you here about what happent to Jim?"
Yes I told him he said "Jim left a note for you, he wrote to give it to you when they found him"
He handed me the note and left.  I got into my house sat down and read the note what was written in there was probably the most disturbing thing I ever read in my entire life it said
"I'm sorry I left you with that thing"
In the note was a key to the basement 
I was shaking out of fear I didn't know what to say I just wanted to dissappear from the world and forget about it but I knew I couldn't run away, curiosity got me I needed to know what was in there.







I told myself tonight I will open the basement door and find out what's in there all day I was getting ready to do it and there it was the time hit 11 pm the screaming started I was scared but I knew I had to do it, I'm going downstairs to the basement as I'm writing this wish me luck I inserted the key and I opened the door there it was it's looking at me,waiting 
I will end the story here I won't describe it to not traumatize any of the readers I will say that I understand why Jim took his own life.
