I’m an undertaker, which means my job involves guiding souls to the afterlife.   
  
It’s a weird job, sure, but the pay is great, it offers free lodging, and I love what I do. Every cemetery has one- from the smallest plots of land to the huge cemeteries you come across in large cities. It’s pretty simple; I greet the newly deceased at their casket once everyone’s gone, have them fill out the necessary paperwork, and work with them to find the best way to pass on to the afterlife. Some souls are easier to guide than others, especially older souls who’ve lived a fulfilling life. It’s always harder with younger souls who died unfortunately early and haven’t accepted the fact that they’re dead yet. Those souls always tend to stick around for a bit, before they have some sort of epiphany and finally move on.   
  
I’ve been asked how I even found this job. It’s a hard job to get; not only is it pretty demanding, you also really need to time it right, especially because cemeteries are going out of fashion these days. Cremation is all the rage for environmental purposes, I get it. But there’s something to be said about traditional burials. I just so happened to apply when there was an opening for a new plot of land dedicated to burials five years ago, and the rest is history.  
  
My cemetery is on the smaller side, but it still calls for a lot of care and attention. This particular cemetery is mostly dedicated to unmarked graves and the graves of people whose family couldn’t afford other plots of land. But every cemetery is different. My friend Wes, for instance, is in charge of a plot of burials for the family members of a billionaire. Between us, I think he’s gotten a ton of insider info, because he started investing in all the right stocks and is now in a great position for retirement. My other friend, Piper, is in charge of a burial plot for A-list celebrities, and the tea she gets from the souls is piping hot. That’s the goal- you only get the fancy cemeteries if you prove yourself and rise up the ranks, but five years is barely anything to write home about. I still have ways to go before I can even qualify for a promotion.  
  
Some cemeteries are placed in bustling areas, and some cemeteries are visited more frequently than others. Mine is in a pretty quiet area, up on a small hill in the middle of nowhere. Right next to the cemetery is the church that I live in. There are a few stores and restaurants around at the bottom of the hill, along with a small library and a town hall, but getting up and down is a hassle. I mostly only go to pick up groceries and occasionally treat myself to a nice pastry at the bakery.  
  
But hey, I get paid a decent salary to maintain the grounds, guide the occasional soul that comes in, and I even get overtime if the soul sticks around for longer than they’re supposed to. You really can’t beat it.  
  
Well- except for the fact that it’s lonely as hell. I fill my time by reading, listening to podcasts, trying new recipes, and jotting down things to share with this subreddit, because plenty of strange things have happened in the course of this job- but I never really felt the urge to upload anything until now.  
  
I started noticing a new shop being built across the street from my cemetery. I was shocked when people started coming to renovate the dilapidated hut that had been abandoned for years, because I really didn’t think that this place was worth investing any real estate in. Over the past few months, the hut began to shape into a neat and presentable residence, the rotting wood being replaced with white wooden panels and the flat roof being taken apart to create a triangular shape.   
  
The renovations went on for a while and there seemed to be no end in sight, until just the other day. I was sweeping the premises as usual, making sure Frankie G.’s tomb was as spick and span as he requested it before he left- when a tiny buggy haphazardly pulled up in the cemetery’s driveway. The door slammed, and a short woman emerged from the car, carrying a toolbox and a placard. She wore a nice yellow sundress, which was an interesting juxtaposition to the bulky, dusty toolbox she was lugging with her.  
  
She didn’t seem to notice me as she headed across the street without looking both ways, and she immediately began to work on putting up the sign in her arms. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem like she could quite reach the area above the door where the sign was supposed to go- and she didn’t seem to have a ladder, either. I found myself instinctively abandoning my duties, dropping my broom to jog over.  
  
“Hello,” I called. The woman yelped and spun around, her facial expression reminiscing a deer in the headlights.  
  
“Sorry,” I put my hands up. “I didn’t mean to scare you, I just- I work across the street, and I saw you struggling to put your sign up, and I was wondering if I could help you?”  
  
“Oh!” Her expression softened immediately. “Yes, I’d really appreciate that.”  
  
She handed the pink-handled hammer and nails to me; I thought the pink was a cute touch to an otherwise gritty tool. As I got to work on centering the sign, I noticed the woman looking around the area curiously.   
  
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you around here before.” I hammered the first nail in. “My name’s Ellis, by the way.”  
  
“I’m Irina.” She took her round glasses off her face, wiping the surface down quickly with the hem of her dress before putting them back on. “Nice to meet you.”  
  
“I like your braids.” I blurted.  
  
“Oh! Um.” Irina paused and fingered her braids, raising an eyebrow. “Thanks? They’re a little messy right now, though.”  
  
God, why did I say that? So stupid. I barely interact with people, if you couldn’t tell already. In fact, because I spend so much of my time mostly talking to the recently dead, my social abilities with new real people definitely took a hit.  
  
“Sorry, I meant, uh, the flowers.” Each braid had a little flower weaved through it, and that was really what I meant to point out, but instead now I looked like an awkward weirdo.  
  
“I thought it would be fitting.” Irina smiled softly, smoothing her dress down. “I’m the owner of this flower shop. I’m open for business starting tomorrow, but I forgot to hand the workers this sign before they finished building the whole place.”  
  
Indeed, her sign read “Irina’s Florals” with the subtitle listing out the various flower arrangement services she provided- everything from celebrations, weddings, anniversaries, to funeral arrangements. To the right was a large window with a counterspace lined with various different flowers. From the outside, the interior looked clean and inviting, with examples of arrangements already neatly tucked away into see-through fridges to keep them from wilting.  
  
“That’s great,” I nodded, knocking the nails in steadily. “Families always have to go back and forth between this place and the main towns to get flowers for the procession.” I always try to warn families about the lack of establishments in this area in advance so they don’t have to go back and forth twice, but it always seems to happen anyway. “Now they can just get flowers right across the street.”  
  
“You said you work at the cemetery?” Irina cocked her head to the side. “Are you the groundskeeper?”  
  
“Yeah, something like that.” One more thing about my job- most people think I’m clinically insane when I tell them my job- I’m only telling you guys because this sub seems to welcome this sort of stuff, but try telling someone in real life that your main job is to guide recently deceased souls to the afterlife and see what kind of reaction you’re met with. “I’m here every single day, 9 to 5, 5 to 9, and maybe some time after that if necessary. Guaranteed, cleanest cemetery in the area. I also live here. Right in that church.”  
  
“I see.” Irina looked concerned, glancing at the church briefly. “That doesn't really sound like a healthy work-life balance.”  
  
She then blinked. “Sorry, that was a little uncalled for. I don’t even know you. I’ve never met a guy who’s so passionate about sweeping leaves away from graves.”  
  
“Oh no, I just really love my job!” I grinned. “Time flies when you’re maintaining these grounds, trust me.”  
  
“I guess I’ll have to take your word for it.” she giggled, her eyes upturned.  
  
“That’s me,” I puffed out my chest slightly. “I guess I’m just a hard worker.”    
  
“Certainly sounds like you are.”   
  
I carefully slammed the final nail in. “So, what brings you here? I mean, not very many people really voluntarily choose to move here. Small town and all that.”  
  
Irina paused, arms crossed. “It’s a nice place.”  
  
“Yeah?” I grinned. “I’m glad you think so. I think it’s a great place, too. Where are you coming from? Do you need any recommendations for around town? Ricardo’s has the best produce. If you like Italian, I know a great place. Do you like Italian? Or do you prefer other cuisines?”  
  
The corner of Irina’s lip twitched. “You sure ask a lot of questions.”  
  
“Oh, sorry.” I said sheepishly, not realizing I was rambling. I felt a blush creep up on my cheeks; it had been so long since I’d talked to a new, breathing human being that I had forgotten not to be overbearing. “I’m done, by the way.”  
  
Irina took a step back, looked at the sign, and beamed. “It looks great! Thanks so much for helping me, Ellis.”   
  
I think my heart stopped for a few moments seeing that smile and hearing my name in her voice.  
  
“It’s no problem at all.” I packed away her tools neatly for her, noticing some rust on the tools piled in her bag. “We’ll be seeing each other often, won’t we?”  
  
Irina pursed her lips, looking thoughtful as she stared at her sign.  
  
“Wait here- I need to return the favor.” Irina crossed the street quickly, rummaging through her car trunk for a few moments before returning with a small bouquet of white flowers.  
  
“For you.”  
  
“Oh!” I didn’t know how to react- I’d never received flowers before in my life, and I didn’t know how to react faced with this gift. Was I supposed to sniff them? Would that be weird? Is it strange to openly sniffing a bouquet of flowers in front of a pretty lady? After much deliberation, I opted to not do so. “Thank you so much. What are these?”  
  
“It’s chamomile.” Irina clasped her hands behind her back, shyly rocking back and forth on her feet. “It’s not much, but a small gesture of my appreciation. I wanted to hand these out to the whole town as a greeting, but looks like there’s not much of a town to hand out to, huh? I have tons of extra flowers laying around my car now.”  
  
“I’m happy to take any extras you have, always!” I insisted. “Flowers would really spruce up the cemetery.” They would also spruce up my room. Hell, they would spruce up my entire life. Anything to interact with her more. Anything that’ll get her to talk to me.  
  
“It’s great for tea,” Irina winked. “You should brew some tonight, let me know how it is tomorrow.”

Before heading off to her car to leave, she turned. "I prefer Mexican food, by the way."   
  
I guess this is what they call love at first sight?  
  
\*  
  
That little interaction gave me enough of an adrenaline rush to finish my day duties quickly. I was excited for that night, because it was New Body Day. I hadn’t had a new soul to talk to in weeks, so I wanted to make sure this one got extra attention. I dug up the hole in the ground to match the casket’s sizing and cleared the surrounding area of any debris. According to the morgue, it was another unidentified John Doe- murdered a couple of days ago. I know it sounds a bit presumptuous to say murder right off the bat, but unfortunately a lot of my clients are involved in criminal activity nearby in some way or form- whether they are directly involved or victims- and suspicious deaths were not uncommon.  
  
Johnny, the mortician, came by exactly at 8 to drop off the body. He looked disheveled as always, an unlit cigarette resting between his lips as he shrugged off his trenchcoat. I recognized the crumple of gravel and the smell of the exhaust fumes from his van as he pulled into the driveway. Johnny wasn’t the most outwardly friendly guy around, but you could tell he was just a little rough around the edges.   
  
“Johnny! It’s been weeks!” I waved from my window, holding out my tea kettle. “Would you like to try my new concoction?”  
  
Johnny grimaced, running his hands through his graying hair. “Concoction’s not the most inviting word.”  
  
“We have a new neighbor across the street.” I pointed at the flower shop. “She’s a florist, and she’s starting tomorrow. And she gave me these.”  
  
I presented him with the bouquet of chamomile, half of which was now steeping in my teapot.  
  
“Chamomile?” Johnny frowned.  
  
“Yeah!”  
  
“I’m good, thanks. That stuff puts me to sleep right away. You got any coffee?”  
  
“Sure do,” After fiddling with the Keurig and pouring myself a thermos of tea, I ran downstairs to help Johnny unload the unmarked casket from the trunk of his van. We lifted it up to the dolley, then braked it upright to ensure it didn’t fall while we chatted.  
  
“Was it bad?” I handed the mug to Johnny, who put up his hand instead to light his cigarette. After getting a drag in, he grabbed the coffee and took a long swig.   
  
“Not the worst I’ve seen. But also, not consistent with everything else we’ve been seeing.”  
  
“What do you mean?” I sipped my tea; the flavor was strong and wonderful.  
  
“See for yourself.”  
  
Johnny pulled his work phone from his pocket, showing me the pictures of the body he took. I really should be used to seeing dead bodies at this point, but it still turned my stomach a bit. “It’s usually gunshots that do them in around these parts. This guy? Blunt force trauma to the head, followed by what I think is a screwdriver through the temple. Don’t know if it’s related to the cartels, seems a little more personal.”  
  
I flipped to the side profile of the head; it was a gory scene indeed. The John Doe’s temple bore open into a gaping, bloody wound. Though the body itself was already cold and expressionless, I could only imagine the horrified expression of anguish this man must have had before Johnny got to work on him.  
  
“My guess is, someone must have ambushed him from behind with something heavy. Maybe a rock.”  
  
"Or a hammer," I blurted.  
  
Johnny hummed. “Sure, could be a hammer.”   
  
I didn’t know why I said that- and I also didn’t know why my brain immediately conjured up the image of the rusty tools in Irina’s bag.   
  
“Or maybe it was a rock.” I backtracked, shaking my head. “Or a baseball bat, maybe.”  
  
“As much as I’d like to keep playing this guessing game, bud, I gotta go watch the game.” Johnny clapped me twice on the shoulder. “You got it from here?”  
  
I nodded, watching Johnny get into his van and drive off into the night. I always enjoyed our little interactions, even though Johnny always seemed to be in a bit of a hurry to leave. I turned to the casket, yawning.  
  
“Well, Mr. Doe,” I tapped the casket. “It’s just you and me. You can come out now.”  
  
There was no response from the casket. Normally the soul would be itching to emerge, but only silence followed.   
  
“Hmm.” I sipped my tea again, walking around the casket. “Maybe you’re a bit shy.”  
  
Still, silence. I didn’t feel the presence of any spirit from the casket at all. This was going to be tough; ambush victims were always the hardest souls to deal with.   
  
“That’s alright.” I slapped the wood lightly. “Maybe we can circle back to this tomorrow. I’m feeling unusually tired. You see, I met a girl today.”  
  
I finished my tea and balanced my thermos on the foot of the dolley, and began rolling the casket into the mausoleum. I’ve learned that souls find it comforting if I talked about myself for a bit, because it helped them feel more at ease about emerging.  
  
“I haven’t talked to a new girl in a long time, and she was really cute. Her name’s Irina, and she’s the florist next door. Well, not yet- she’s starting tomorrow. She just finished building her little shop. It looks really cute, just like her. I think I fumbled it, though, ‘cause I’m a bit awkward. I guess that’s what happens when you take care of dead people for a living, huh? You start losing it a bit.”  
  
I yawned again, placing the dolley in the corner of the mausoleum. “Well, it’s fine if you’re not ready yet. I’m a bit tired anyway- probably ‘cause I spent all my brainpower trying to not completely fall apart in front of her. Which was really hard, by the way. Good night, Mr. Doe.”  
  
I was unusually tired- usually I had enough in me to keep going, but if the soul didn’t want to come out tonight, there was always tomorrow. I chalked my tiredness up to the sudden onslaught of anxiety. I wouldn’t have been able to do good job with such lack of sleep, so I made the executive decision to put a pin on this for later. I cleaned and locked up the mausoleum, heading back to my room in the church to sleep.  
  
\*  
  
That night, I had a terrible dream. It started off great- I was sitting on a picnic blanket in a field of chamomile. The grass swayed gently, with a beautifully clear lake blanketed under the cliff, pouring champagne into two glass flutes and dressed in my best suit. The air smelled sweet and herbal. As I buttered a soft slice of bread, I turned behind to see Irina walking towards me with a big smile, with that beautiful yellow sundress-  
  
Except the sundress was covered with blood. Her face had spatters of blood on it, the blood from her glasses trickling down to her chin and staining the stray strands of her hair. Her smile wasn’t that of a happy person- it was crazed. Her eyes were wild, round, and darting from corner to corner, as if to scope out her prey. Her long, brown hair was matted, messy, with no flowers or braids in sight.  
  
From her right hand emerged a hammer- the same hammer with the pink handle that I used to hammer her sign in. In her left hand was a screwdriver, dripping with blood. And she was headed right towards me.  
  
I instinctively held my hands up in front of me in defense, squeezing my eyes for impact- but the impact never came. In fact, Irina seemed to walk right through me, marching towards the lake where a man was staring out into the water.  
  
I abandoned the picnic, scrambled to my feet, and tried to warn the man to turn around- but my voice wasn’t working. No matter how much I tried to scream, nothing came out. I watched as Irina approached the man, raising her hammer before slamming it down onto the man’s skull. I witnessed the force of the hammer smash a visible dent into the man’s head, sending him plummeting down the cliff. Before I could reach her, Irina followed suit- jumping off the cliff. Panicked, I skidded at the edge of the cliff, peering down and expecting the worst.   
  
But Irina was standing at the bottom, looming over the man’s body, and she was laughing wholeheartedly. Head tossed to the sun, the rays kissing her tan skin, she laughed and laughed as she drove the screwdriver into the man’s temple repeatedly.  
  
I thought she looked hauntingly beautiful.  
  
\*  
  
In retrospect, it was a good thing that I never could sleep for too long.   
  
My eyes flew open at 3AM on the dot as the loud clanking outside reached my subconscious. My first thought was that someone was trying to break into the cemetery- I’ve had to deal with my fair share of grave robbers. I hurried out of bed to dash downstairs. Unfortunately, the cemetery had already been broken into- the fence was torn down, and the chains were broken. But a quick glance indicated all the graves were still intact, and the premises were otherwise empty save for a light fog that had settled above the grass. I whipped my head to the mausoleum immediately, realizing the door was open.  
  
A hot flash of fear and anxiety ran down my body. Had I left the door open?   
  
No, it was impossible; I always locked down the mausoleum every night before heading back to bed. Someone had broken in. But as I turned on my heels to go in, I felt a cold grip on my arm.  
  
Let me preface this by saying- souls almost never look great when they first come in. In fact, most of them are in pretty bad shape- whether it be from old age, or whatever accident they were in, they’re not exactly easy on the eyes. This particular soul perfectly matched the John Doe Johnny brought in; slightly paunchy, with half of his head smashed into his face. Blood came out of his eyes, with one eyeball holding onto its socket by a thread. Multiple teeth were missing from his mouth. He was gripping the screwdriver lodged in his temple as if to hold it in place to not lose any more blood, even though the wound continued to gush out blood like a broken water fountain. He looked exactly like he did in the dream- except, he was hobbling with additional slashes to his legs.  
  
I gasp-screamed, stumbling back. The soul shook his head quickly, panicked.  
  
“I-I’m sorry, it’s not you, I swear.” I reassured; the worst thing to do was to make a soul insecure in their looks. “This sort of appearance is very common for recently deceased people.”  
  
“Be quiet!” The soul pleaded. “Sh-she’ll hear us!”  
  
“Who?”  
  
“Y-you need to get me out of here.” The soul stammered. “You have to help me. I can’t be here. I’m not supposed to be here.”  
  
I put on my best customer service voice on, realizing the soul was shaken up- a totally normal reaction. “I’m sorry, sir, but the fact that you are here means you’re dead-“  
  
“No, not that! I know I’m dead! I don’t give a fuck!” John Doe whisper-yelled, looking around. “She’s after me! I-I won’t be able to pass on!”  
  
I smiled. Some people held onto notions of religion even as souls, and it was part of my job to teach them that they could move onto the afterlife, regardless of belief. “That’s also a very common misconception. Everyone passes onto the next stage, which is the afterlife, which, really is just a fancy term for the steps towards reincarnation-“  
  
“No, man, you don’t get it!” The soul began to quiver, staring straight past me. “She’s gonna make sure I won’t ever pass on.”  
  
“Who will?”  
  
The soul raised a shaking finger slowly, pointing behind me. I turned just in time to see a dark figure emerge from the mausoleum. There, in a simple black dress that covered her feet, stood Irina, wielding what looked to be a large scythe covered in flowers by her side. Her hair was no longer in braids, and instead flowed freely behind her, her glasses also nowhere to be seen. Her eyes widened when we locked gazes.  
  
“Ellis?”  
  
“Irina?”  
  
Irina looked confused, squinting at me, then at the spirit, back to me again.  
  
“You…you were supposed to be asleep.”  
  
“I-I was!”  
  
“No, you were supposed to be, like, *completely* knocked out.” Irina’s grip on her scythe tightened. “The chamomile I gave you- it was supposed to be strong enough to put you in deep sleep. At least 10 hours.”  
  
“Well, I guess you wouldn’t have known this, but I have really bad chronic insomnia. Not much of a cure for that, unfortunately.” I laughed nervously. “The tea tasted really good, though!”  
  
Irina didn’t laugh. My face fell, and I cleared my throat.  
  
“So, uh, it looks like you…accidentally broke into my cemetery, and also accidentally broke into the mausoleum?” I offered. “At 3 in the morning?”  
  
“It wasn’t an accident.”   
  
“Right.” No benefit of the doubt, then.  
  
“I knew you weren’t just some regular groundskeeper,” Irina sighed as she pushed her hair back. “What kind of regular groundskeeper enjoys his job that much?”  
  
“I-“  
  
“You see him, too, right?”  
  
I turned behind me to see the soul frozen in place. “Oh, this guy here? Yeah, he looked to be in pretty bad shape, so I, uh, I was trying to help him find his way back home.”  
  
Irina remained expressionless.   
  
“That man,” she began. “Is never going to find his way back home again. He will never be given a chance at reincarnation, and I’m going to make sure of that.”  
  
The soul whimpered as Irina marched closer to us. Instinctively, I moved in front of the soul to block him.  
  
“I can’t let you do that.”  
  
Irina glared at me, raising her scythe. “Get out of my way.”  
  
“That woman killed me,” The soul exclaimed, stumbling backwards. “She killed me in broad daylight-“  
  
“And *you*,” Irina seethed. “*You* killed my family.”  
  
I froze in place. “What?”  
  
Though she was angry, pain was evident on Irina’s face. “He was part of the cartel that killed my entire family. My mom, dad, brother, sisters, and I…” Her knuckles turned white as her grip tightened even further. “I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t have to. But I was the only one who made it out, so I’m the one who needs to track them down.”  
  
“Did you really kill this man?” I tried not to sound accusatory, but it seemed like I had, because Irina’s eyes met mine in a fit of rage.  
  
“I had to. It would have taken too long for him to pass naturally. I don’t have enough time. A bad soul like him can’t be reincarnated again, it’ll just perpetuate the cycle.”  
  
“But you- you can’t just murder people!” I stammered.  
  
Irina frowned, and it looked like she was almost sad. “You wouldn't get it.” She gripped the front of my shirt, shoving me out of the way with a strength I didn’t know she had before I could respond.   
  
“Irina, I-“  
  
She had already checked out of our conversation, now directly addressing John Doe. “Do you remember me?”  
  
The soul shook his head.  
  
“I-I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I really- I really don’t remember much.”  
  
“Really,” Irina bent down towards him to stare at him at eye level. “Salvador Alvarez ring a bell? Or maybe Maria?”

Irina reached into her pocket and pulled out a gold locket, holding it up in front of the soul's face and forcing him to stare into the picture.  
  
“I- I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t know who you’re talking about. I don't know who those people are.”  
  
“Of course you don’t.” she smiled sardonically, snapping the locket shut. “To you, we were just another family to target.”  
  
“I swear, if I knew, I would tell you!”  
  
Irina rose up, bringing her scythe up above her head. The blade glistened in the moonlight.   
  
“I’m sorry!” The soul scrambled backwards on his hands and feet, trying to create distance between him and Irina. “I- I’ll do anything, please, let me go-“  
  
Before she could swing her scythe down, I snapped to my senses and grabbed her arms, preventing her from finishing the blow.  
  
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Irina struggled against my grip. “Let go of me!”  
  
The soul saw his opportunity and began to crawl into the distance.   
  
“I can’t let you do," I paused. I wasn't exactly sure what she was doing. "You know, whatever it is you’re about to do.”  
  
Irina screamed exasperatedly. “You don’t even *know* what I’m doing and you’re *stopping me*?”  
  
“Well, I don’t want to assume, but it doesn’t exactly look good that you’ve broken into my cemetery and you’re now trying to eradicate my client!”  
  
“That’s exactly what I’m doing.”  
  
“And I can’t let you do that!”  
  
In a quick move, Irina tightened her grip on her scythe and elbowed me hard in the chest, sending me tumbling down in a coughing fit.  
  
“Please-“  
  
The blade of her scythe surrounded my neck as I tried to get on my feet. I glanced up to see Irina staring coldly down at me.  
  
“You’re an undertaker, I know what you lot do. You guide souls to the afterlife, and you think that everything is peachy after that." 

She pointed at the soul, who was desperately crawling away on his arms and knees.

"What you *don’t* know is that every single evil soul you send over there, it reincarnates with the same amount of malice they lived with in their past life. And that means murderers will continue to be murderers, and those murderers will continue to take innocent lives and get away with it.”  
  
Her blade inched closer to the side of my neck. “And what you also don’t know is that souls can be prevented from passing on. That they can be ended right at this stage, fresh out of death, before they’re guided out of this realm. The cycle can be broken.”  
  
I gulped. The blade didn’t move an inch. It smelled like roses.  
  
“So, you have a choice,” Irina continued, dipping her chin. “Either you ignore what you saw tonight and leave me alone, or I'll have to kill you, too.”  
  
The fear in my wide eyes seemed to communicate that at least for now, I’d do as she said. I nodded, and immediately felt the blade rescind from my neck.  
  
She turned, giving me one last glance with an expression I couldn’t read, before sauntering off after the soul. I stared at the soul one last time as he desperately crawled away, before Irina crossed the distance between the two, raised her scythe, and-  
  
I closed my eyes, so I couldn’t see what happened next.

So, nosleep: my crush at first sight kind of turned out to be a murderer, and also kind of a destroyer of souls, and also kind of my enemy by default. She also did sort of threaten me with a blade to my neck. But the thing is, aren’t all relationships a little complicated? And it sounds like she was kind of justified in this situation, I mean, he *did* kill her entire family. And also, she *is* still my new neighbor across the street. I just think that there’s a lot to unpack here, and we shouldn’t judge books by their cover. I think I also have a lot to learn about my job, because clearly I don’t know enough about what’s out there. I’ll keep you all updated on what goes on as things happen.
