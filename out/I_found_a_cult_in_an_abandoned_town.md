Hi, my name is Alexis and I found an abandoned city in California and I want to warn people to never go to it. I have let the local police know what I saw but I'm afraid they may too be apart of the cult. Right, I haven't told you everything yet so let me start last Friday night. 

I am an urban explorer by trade and I have often posted my findings on the urban explorer subredddits and this place was hinted to be untouched. Well, I didn't believe them as there's always signs of someone being there. Even old rundown bunkers in the middle of the woods there's fresh beer cans etc.

Well, I decided to check it out. It was surrounded by a layer of electric fences but they were old and rusty as if they been off for quite sometime. I didn't want to test my luck so I grabbed my voltmeter and checked it. "Hell yea! It's dead!" I silently cheared to myself. I grabbed my bolt cutters from my car and made a small hole to crouch into. 

I cautiously stepped onto the cracked pavement of the deserted town, feeling the eerie silence surround me. The buildings were all in a perfect state of preservation, yet they seemed to be frozen in time, like relics of a bygone era. I couldn't help but wonder how such a clean and pristine town could be abandoned for so long.

I've done this for years now so this was really odd. The lawns were not kept up, there were no cars and the electricity didn't even work. The first house I entered was a lime green building with chipping paint and a mahogany door. Turning the door knob and entering the home the first thing I noticed was the living room was styled In a very 50s fashion. An old consol TV sat infront of a cyan blue couch. 

Looking around the house I started to notice this place was evacuated by the government as there was still clothes, toys and even calenders with dates circled. "May 1956, huh... I wonder why no one's ever talked about this?" I thought to myself. I've heard of towns being evacuated before to build like a new lake or dam but this was in the middle of nowhere and I can't find out why. The whole thing gave me a genuine feeling of unease. "Maybe it was a nuclear test site or perhaps military drills or camps" I said under my breath. 

I wondered into the master bedroom and was scared shirtless as two bodies were laying in the bed. I almost ran out until I noticed they were solid white and stiff. I tip toed to the bed and noticed they were mannequins and looked to be holding each other. "Who would do this shit?" I thought to myself. I laughed a little as I layed next to them and joked a bit but got quickly bored. 

As I walked down the empty streets, completely bereft of life. However, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was watching me. The stillness was deafening, and it seemed like even the wind had stopped singing. I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that it was just my imagination running wild. Strangely enough I noticed every home and store had those mannequins which confirmed my assumption of this being a military training ground. But it was strange that they were all placed in extremely organic looking positions. 

As I continued my exploration, I stumbled upon a small alleyway between 2 old ice cream shops. It seemed to lead to the center of the town. The alleyway was dark, damp and cold.I hesitated before deciding to venture down the impossibly dark corridor. The smell of rusty iron assaulted my nose as I got closer to the center. 

Suddenly, I saw a flicker of light in the distance. I approached it cautiously, and as I got closer, I could hear chanting and praying as a group of people wearing masks with blank faces held small black candles. They were all wearing old clothes like what were in the homes. Old 50s clothing with the hairstyles to match. 

They all surrounded a child who was muffled and tied an alter. The child was only about 16 or 17 years old. She screamed in agony and struggled to get out however her screams were being overpowered by the cultists chanting. I knelt in the ally behind a trash can and using my phone to record the whole thing so I don't get seen looking at this. 

Moments later the "leader" walked out of the group wearing a white robe and the blank mask. He held a knife that looked to be made of shadows as it consumed any light that touched it. He spoke with a thundering voice and oddly in a Transatlantic accent. Kinda like those old radio/movie speakers. 

Anyways, he said "Tonight is the mark of the first sacrifice this month! We owe this sacrifice to the great nothing. Without the Great Nothing we would have been old, saggy and pathetic humans. May this sacrifice purge the old age from our bodies and satisfy the Great Nothing! Praise be The Blank!" 

With a swift hand the knife was plunged into the spine of the girl. Separating her spine and disabling her movement. I almost gaged as I saw her body flop to the ground lifelessly like a discarded toy. The cultists then rushed her body like a pack of starving dogs...and began...to tear the girl to shreds. The sound of tearing flesh and cracking bones filled the once silent air. I couldn't hold it in any longer it was the sound of muscles being snapped like rubber bands that caused my stomach to expell its contents so, I had to escape

Luckily, the cultists were too engrossed in their horrific ritual to notice my escape, and I managed to make my way back to the empty streets of the town. My heart was pounding as I ran, desperate to get as far away from the cultists as possible. Sounds of my discovery is what I heard in the dark distance. But at that point it was too late and I was already a football field away. 

As I fled from the town, I realized that I had narrowly avoided becoming a victim of the cult's twisted rituals. The memory of  the sickening crunch of bones and evicerating of flesh still haunts me. 

I didn't stop driving until I reached a few towns north. Where I pulled over on the sidewalk, gasping for breath and still shaking in fear. A passersby looked at me in confusion and horror as I screamed and cried, reliving the nightmare that I had just experienced. 

In the days that followed, I couldn't shake off the memory of what I had seen in the abandoned town. I knew that I had stumbled upon something evil, and that the cultists were still out there, preying on innocent children.

I spoke to the police last night and fear they would not believe me or that the cultists would come after me. I have to let you guys know never to trust the town. Hopefully, knowing what it looks like may keep any urban explorer at bay. 

To be honest, I recently had a nightmare of a blank faced child sitting at my bed staring at me. I felt no anger only sadness but when I went to confront and comfort the child it grabbed me. In my nightmare it was slowly consuming me by turning my skin into a plastic substance like a mannequin. WellWelli fear I may not be long for this world... left arm is almost complete made of hard plastic and I can feel it spreading.
