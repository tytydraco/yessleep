I always joke that September 28th is the worst day of the year because it’s when my mother comes to visit. You know how moms can be—judgmental, overbearing, always pointing out what you’re doing wrong. The funny part is, she doesn’t even knock. She just *shows up*. Every year. Same time. No warning.

I’ve moved cities, changed my number, and yet... there she is, right on time.

She's the kind of mom who could track me down no matter where I went. Even if I was hiding out in some faraway country, I swear she’d find a way to barge in, reminding me of all the ways I’ve fallen short of her expectations. That’s the kind of woman she is. Every September 28th at exactly 10:02 PM, my mother comes to visit me. 

Only, she’s been dead for 6 years.

It started the year after she died—well, after *I* killed her. I was 19. It happened in the bathroom. She was always so fixated on "cleansing" me, drowning me in her twisted version of salvation. She’d dunk me under cold water, muttering prayers, trying to scrub the "sin" from me. That night, she shoved me under again, screaming that I was too filthy to save. But I fought back. I kicked hard enough to send her tumbling backward, and her head hit the old clawfoot tub with a sickening crack. That was it. She was gone.

I thought it was over. I thought I could breathe again, that her judgment and punishment had finally ended. But she had other plans.

The first time she came back, I thought it was a nightmare. I woke up soaked, freezing, and there she was—standing at the foot of my bed, drenched in water, her clothes clinging to her like she’d just crawled out of a lake. Her mouth was open in a silent scream, the same way she used to yell at me during those “cleansing” rituals. But no sound came out. Her eyes—God, those wide, bulging eyes—were locked on me with that same religious fury.

I tried to move, but the second I did, her mouth started to split wider, tearing at the corners, blood seeping down her chin. Her hands shot toward my throat, ice-cold and impossibly strong. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t scream. I thrashed, but it only made her grip tighter.

That’s when I learned the rule. I stopped moving, stopped fighting. The pressure eased. She just stood there, screaming silently, dripping water all over me, watching. If I stayed still, she wouldn’t touch me. Not until morning.

Every year since, she’s come back. Every year, at 10:02 PM, I feel the room grow cold, smell the dampness in the air, and I know she’s there—my dead mother, still convinced she can "cleanse" me, still punishing me for sins I don’t even believe in.

I used to joke about dreading her visits, but now I don’t bother. The jokes don’t help anymore. Because no matter where I go, how far I run, she’ll always find me.

And this year, as the clock ticks closer to 10:02, I wonder how much longer I can stay still. I can feel her coming. The room’s already growing colder, and I know her mouth is stretching wider. Each year it’s worse. Each year, her eyes get hungrier, her hands quicker to reach for my throat.

I’ve learned to dread this “visit” more than anything in the world.

Because one day, I won’t be able to stay still.

And when that happens, she’s going to finish what she started.
