I’ve always loved the woods. Ever since I was a kid, I would spend hours exploring the trails and paths behind my house, looking for hidden treasures and secrets. My best friend Jake shared my passion, and we would often go on adventures together, pretending to be explorers or detectives or superheroes. We had a lot of fun, and we never got bored.  
  
One day, when we were 12 years old, we decided to go deeper into the woods than we ever had before. We packed some snacks and drinks, and we set off with our bikes. We followed a dirt road that led us to a clearing, where we saw something that made us stop in awe.  
  
It was a space station.  
  
It looked like a giant metal dome, with antennas and solar panels sticking out of it. It was covered in rust and dirt, and it looked like it had been abandoned for a long time. We couldn’t believe our eyes. How did it get there? Who built it? What was inside?  
  
We were curious and excited. We decided to check it out, hoping to find some cool stuff inside. Maybe some alien artifacts, or some futuristic gadgets, or some secret documents. We left our bikes near the entrance, and we walked towards the door.  
  
It was unlocked.  
  
We pushed it open, and we stepped inside. It was dark and cold, and it smelled like metal and dust. We turned on our flashlights, and we looked around. We saw wires and pipes and screens and buttons everywhere. It looked like a sci-fi movie set.  
  
We walked through the corridors, looking for anything interesting. We found some rooms that looked like labs, with tables and machines and tubes and beakers. We found some rooms that looked like living quarters, with beds and lockers and posters and books. We found some rooms that looked like storage areas, with crates and boxes and barrels and cans.  
  
We didn’t find anything that looked alien or futuristic or secret. Everything looked old and broken and useless. We were disappointed, but we still enjoyed exploring the place. It was like a giant playground for us.  
  
We decided to split up, to cover more ground. Jake went to the left, and I went to the right. We agreed to meet back at the entrance in an hour. We kept our flashlights on, and we kept in touch with our walkie-talkies.  
  
I walked through more corridors, more rooms, more junk. I didn’t find anything worth keeping or telling anyone about. I was getting bored and tired. I decided to head back to the entrance.  
  
I reached the door, and I waited for Jake.  
  
He didn’t show up.  
  
I tried to contact him on the walkie-talkie.  
  
He didn’t answer.  
  
I started to worry.  
  
I called his name.  
  
He didn’t reply.  
  
I decided to go look for him.  
  
I retraced my steps, following the path he took.  
  
I reached the end of the corridor.  
  
I saw something that made me scream.  
  
I saw a creature.  
It was huge and hairy and muscular, with claws and fangs and horns. It looked like a cross between a bear and a wolf and a goat. It had red eyes that glowed in the dark, and it had blood dripping from its mouth.  
It was holding Jake.  
Jake was limp and pale, with bite marks and scratches all over his body. He looked like he was dead.  
The creature saw me, and it roared.  
It dropped Jake, and it charged at me.  
I ran.  
I ran as fast as I could, back to the entrance. I didn’t look back, I didn’t stop, I didn’t think. I just ran.  
I reached the door, and I slammed it shut behind me. I locked it, and I leaned against it. I heard the creature banging on the other side, trying to break through. I heard it growling and snarling and scratching.  
I was terrified.  
I grabbed my bike, and I pedaled away from the space station. I didn’t care about the trail or the road or the direction. I just wanted to get away from that thing.  
I rode for what felt like hours, until I reached my house. I threw my bike on the lawn, and I ran inside. I locked the door behind me, and I collapsed on the couch.  
I was safe.  
I was alive.  
But Jake wasn’t.  
He was gone.  
He was taken by that thing.  
I never saw him again.  
I never told anyone what happened that day. I never went back to the woods. I never explored anything ever again.  
I still have nightmares about that day. I still wonder what happened to Jake. Was he killed? Was he experimented on? Was he taken to another world?  
I don’t know, and I don’t think I ever will.
