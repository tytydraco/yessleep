I knew one of us had performed a summoning ritual. I did not know which one, but I had to figure it out. 

A sigil carved in the ground of the warehouse area the year before was visible upon my departure. Each angle resembled the horns of a demon. There was no denying the black magick. The symbol was not there before our entrance. I had to find out which one of us was the occultist.

The four of us had been friends since our teenage years. Every Christmas week we held a party in a building that we had no business being in. Our reason is tied to nostalgia. 

Back in 2005, we had all gotten together in the basement of a children’s toy store after hours. The place was part of a major franchise I will not name but which you have heard of. 

The party was a great time. That particular year, we waxed poetic about where we hoped our future careers to take us. The romantic interests we aspired to were also discussed. We also shared urban myths about our community to try and scare one another. All four of us - Ann, Brian, Edward, and I - came from less unstable homes. Our parents had toxic behaviors.

In 2018, the same string of well-known businesses had all died out worldwide. The advent of e-commerce took its toll. We kept our tradition going. The lack of security made our annual get-together easier to achieve. 

Our yearly meet-ups were something that we all looked forward to. As time passed we introduced other activities to make the night fun. Poker games and occasional liquor consumption became unfortunate habits. The similarities to our parents were not lost on me. 

There were times when we considered calling it off, but weirdly, it seemed as though the club belonged to us. It gave us a sense of power and control over something that we did not have in any other aspect of our lives. 

Sure, Edward ended up being a successful financial analyst. Brian became a private pilot. Ann became a popular podcaster on relationship advice. I worked for a real estate company. 

Despite our envious positions, none of our destinations matched our visualized finish lines.

The year before last, I saw the sigil painted in vivid detail. The cheap fluorescent lights bounding off of it made it glimmer. I did not ruminate on it in regards to anything about it beyond that until the next year transpired the way it did.

Whoever cast the spell was responsible for it backfiring on each of us.

At the Christmas meet-up of 2021, we commiserated in the subbasement break room. It was once a sanctuary for former employees. 

A red animatronic character from a children’s show sat on a shelf above a coffee machine. It was cobweb-covered. It was the kind you tickled to get some kind of voice reaction from. A line of teddy bears surrounded it to the left and right.

Every one of us had a drink in our hands. A carton of eggnog and a bottle of rum sat in the center of the table. We found an old stereo which played CDs. Christmas carols blared in the background.

“I need everybody’s attention,” I said after I stood and dropped my palms on the hard surface.

They all looked up at me and stopped mid-conversation. I was always an introvert by nature. Bringing everyone’s focus onto my presence was not something they expected.

“I’ve talked to everyone in this room via email, text, and phone calls over the last year. In that time frame, our lives have gone to hell. Ann, you had a severe nervous breakdown. Brian, you got mugged four consecutive times, and you don’t even live in a crime-ridden area. Eddie, you were hospitalized after a house fire almost took your life. I'm sure the smoke inhalation alone has done permanent damage.”

“What happened to you?” Ann asked. 

“I was the victim of a home invasion,” I said. “A masked man entered my place in the middle of the night back in July. I don’t even know what his motive was. I don’t own anything of high value except for my entertainment system. He slashed me in the stomach.”

I lifted my shirt and showed them the scar. I let it drop and continued.

“There’s an even more incidental - or should I say deliberate - similarity we all have besides a run of bad luck. Raise your hands if you’ve had nightmares in the last year. Ones about black skies and lightning strikes?”

Everybody’s hand went up. The three looked at each other with insurmountable terror. 

“I refuse to believe any of this is a coincidence,” I said. “Somebody cast a spell last year. They used some kind of magical ceremony involving symbols. The symbol I’m referring to was in the back of the house area, near one of the warehouse sections. I know I wasn’t the only one to see it. I think we all did, but none of us thought it was anything meaningful at the time. Whoever drew it may have had good intentions, but I’ve read further material. If you don’t seal it off at the end or combine it with some kind of protection spell, it has karmic consequences. It can blow up in your face. Sigils usually have some kind of cost, especially the ones from older eras. Someone in this group did it. Now is the time for you to come forward.”

“Someone roped us into their crazy beliefs and cast a curse we all have to pay for,” Brian asked with anger in his voice.

“Now is the time for one of us to step forward and confess,” I said.

Nobody did.

I walked around the room and locked both of the exit doors with a master key I had managed to scour from a manager‘s office. I heard a few gasps of shock.

“I’ll swallow the key before I let anyone take it off of me,” I said. “I am presenting an opportunity for one of you to come clean.”

I saw Brian stand and move into my left periphery.

I saw him reach into his pants pocket and pull out a knife big enough to bring onto a battlefield.

He stabbed the table with it. Ann and Edward backed away into a corner.

“I’ve had several concussions this year,” Brian said. “My life and health suffered. I saw the symbol he was talking about. He’s not wrong. It was someone in this room. It was one of *you two.*”

He pointed the tip of the blade at Ann and Eddie.

“Somebody needs to own up to the misfortune we’ve all had,” Brian said.

Brian scanned the room. He gave everyone a menacing glare. His eyes averted back to Ann. 

“I think it was you,” he said. “You were the one in high school who always wore black and listened to weird music no one else our age was into. Your notebooks always had dark poetry and weird symbolism in them. Your locker had cutouts of metal musicians who wore more black eyeliner than even you did. You thought Tim Burton was a god amongst men. You worshiped all that stuff. You were watching murder documentaries before it was a trendy thing to do. Your fascination with everything macabre was bizarre and made a lot of guys not want to date you. Do you think that because it was a long time ago that we forgot? None of us did. Your reputation will always be that of the strange girl. Nobody wanted to talk to you because you scared them.”

“You think only women can perform dark acts of necromancy?” Ann asked with an irate tone. “You’re too stupid to see how sexist that is. Like it hasn’t been men who have written every major tome on evil spell craft since the beginning of time.”

“See?” Brian said as he made eye contact with everyone else and pointed at her. “How would she know that unless she practices it?”

“Because I’ve read more than two books my entire life,” Ann said. “I'm pretty sure See Spot Run and Indian in the Cupboard are the only novels on your bookshelf, you idiot.”

Edward tackled Brian. 

When they were on the ground, Edward landed elbows onto Brian‘s nose until a stream of blood spurted from it. Brian tried to get to his side and push Edward off of him with his hips. 

It was to no avail as Edward proceeded to put him into a tight headlock once he scrambled to Brian’s back.

Ann flipped the table over and grabbed a chair. She hoisted it in the air and then slammed it down on Brian‘s hand. The same hand still clutched the knife as Edward pushed his forearm into the tile and kept it secured there.

“Let go of the knife or you’re going to be in a world of hurt,” Edward said as he punched Brian in the face again.

I looked at the doors and realized I was in a prime position to be able to run first since I still had the key. Yet instead, I walked over and kicked the knife away. 

Fractured as our group was, I did not want to see any of them harmed if I could prevent it. 

Brian still tried to thrash on the ground.

Edward retrieved the knife. He held it to Brian‘s throat, and Brian ceased moving out of fear at that moment. Edward cocked his left hand back and delivered a blow on Brian’s forehead that was so hard he left him unconscious.

Edward stood up, looked at me, and said “no sudden movements from you, or I’ll have to make that scar even bigger.”

His threat sent a chill down my spine, and I took a few steps back and gave a nod of tacit agreement.

Edward moved across the room, grabbed Ann by the lapels, and slammed her against the wall. He held her in place right below the shelf with the stuffed animals.

“I’m the one who cast the love spell,” he said as a part of the knife sunk into her flesh and blood dripped down her top. “It was to make you mine. We should’ve been together all these years. We could’ve worked so well as a couple. I asked you out twice, and you turned me down both times. I knew deep down you liked me, but you were a little too scared to be mine. I don’t know why you couldn’t see your future the way I did, but it’s no matter now. It looks like the incantation worked, and I’m going to get my wish fulfilled after all. After I kill you I’ll kill myself, and we’ll be together in the afterlife forever.”

Ann reached upwards and pulled the shelf down. It crashed on Edward's head. He tried to reclaim some sort of lucid awareness but tripped over Brian, who was starting to wake up from his daze. 

Edward advanced again. Ann lifted the table and rammed him with it. The blade got caught in the wood. Ann threw him to the ground. Brian stood and kicked Edward in the face.

Neither one of us did anything to stop it.

I looked at Ann and she was already on her cell phone calling 911 as crimson continues to fall down her body. Some of her blood had smeared the wall behind her. I had to do a double-take before I realized it was in the shape of a heart.
