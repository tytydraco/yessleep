When I heard it a second time, I knew it wasn’t just a cry- it was a scream.

“Help!”

The sound hardly cut through the dusk. I’d just left my friend John’s shop, after he helped me with an after-hours suit fitting. As I stepped out, the sky was darkening fast. I had parked near the woods and was on my way to the car.

“I need help! Someone, please!”

Normally, I’d have ignored it- to tell the truth. Trust wasn’t something I handed out easily, especially when it’s dark. But tonight, every step felt heavy. What if it were me? Maybe that’s why I turned back.

“Hello?” I called out.

I stepped into the woods, following a narrow dirt path riddled with rocks. The air smelled of fresh earth. Trees blocked what little light remained, casting orange slashes.

Then I saw him- a man, barely visible in the shadows. His voice echoed from below.

“I’m down here!”

A massive pit lay before me, wider than a car and twice as deep. Its walls were smooth and too steep to climb. No signs of a shovel, just a white duffle bag at the edge, stuffed with old clothes.

The man stood at the bottom, sweat and dirt streaking his face. He looked like an old miner from a black and white photo, grime settling in the lines of his skin. Frizzy, shoulder-length brown hair framed bright eyes.

“Thank god. I thought I was going to spend the night down here,” he said, almost to himself. I couldn’t place his age, but I guessed he was older than me. “I’m Steven. You wouldn’t happen to have any water, would you?”

“No, I don’t. What are you doing in there- are you okay?”

“I was walking back to my tent and I fell into this stupid hole. It wasn’t even here when I left for the soup kitchen.”

The duffle bag must have been his. I glanced around. There was no sign of construction. Maybe hunters? But who hunts so close to town? It would take a lot of effort to clear out this amount of dirt in a day.

“I’ll call for help,” I said, dialling triple zero. The fire department would sort this out.

“No use,” Steven said, waving his phone. “No signal out here. Dead zone.”

“Then I’ll go find help.”

“Wait! Don’t leave me here! There’s wild animals. Just climb down and give me a boost- I can pull you out after.”

“What? No. What if we both got stuck?”

Steven’s voice wavered. “Come on, man. I got some beers- help me out, and we can toast to getting out of this mess.”

Something about that made my stomach tighten.

“It’s really not that far. I’ll be right back,” I said, stepping away.

Back on the street, I hesitated. Calling the fire department felt… wrong. It was late- and what if they had a real emergency? Instead, I called John. He’d still be closing up, and I knew he had a ladder.

The line rang, then clicked. After I explained what happened, silence stretched between us.

“Stay where you are. Keep me on the phone until I get there.” John said.

“What’s with everybody acting weird today?” I asked, half-joking, half-worried.

I stayed on the line until I spotted John cutting across the parking lot- carrying a hunting rifle.

“Jesus, John. What the hell?”

“Show me where you found the hole,” he ordered.

We walked into the woods. Our phone lights barely showed the ground in front of us. John’s rifle stayed raised, scanning every tree and bush.

When we reached the pit, John pointed his rifle inside. It was too dark to see the bottom, but after calling out for Steven we determined he was no longer in the hole.

“He was just here,” I whispered. “He said he’d been yelling for hours. There’s no way he suddenly decided to just climb out.”

Along the edge, faint handholds marked the dirt wall. The duffle bag was gone but the clothes were tossed out.

John exhaled sharply. “Oh, he was here alright. But he was never stuck.”

“You don’t get it. I think he’s homeless- he lives out here. He was covered in dirt. The first thing he asked me for was water.”

John tightened his grip on the rifle. “Twice this year, it’s happened. The police were getting calls about a man shouting in the woods. They didn’t find anyone, until a lady jogging with her dog stumbled across an out-stuck hand- like someone was trying to crawl out of the ground. They found bodies buried in pits just like this one.”

A cold flush ran across my chest. “Fuck, really?”

Sure, Steven had been a little off, but that didn’t mean he was dangerous. Plenty of homeless people set up camps away from prying eyes. \**And toss away their only set of clean clothes\**, I thought.

I felt like an idiot. Like I’d nearly died because, for once, I tried to be decent.

John drove me home. I spent all night reading online articles about the previous two murders and scared myself so bad I didn’t sleep a beat. I left work early for the rest of the week, only walking home while the sun was still up.

I wanted to forget it ever happened.

But now, for the second time tonight, I hear that scream.

“Help me!”

And I know, deep down, it’s him.
