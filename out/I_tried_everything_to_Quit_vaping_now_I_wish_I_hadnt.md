I tried everything I could to quit vaping and in my desperation I turned to the worst thing imaginable. Help. I know what you're thinking, vaping. Seriously? Of all things that you could be addicted to you had to choose the one thing that makes you look like a 16 year old with daddy issues. I agree, but sometimes in life your vices take hold of you and there is nothing you can do to change it. After all, the only one who can change you, is you. 

Around 2018 when I graduated I had been a smoker in highschool. Weed specifically. I only really did it with my friends more akin to peer pressure than anything else. I was once offered a cigarette by one of my friends but chose not to because it seemed gross and smelled bad. Around the time of my graduation I did what any pot addicted loser graduating who didn’t want to go to college would do, I joined the military at the ripe age of 18. My first deployment would come after 5 months into my service. Being sent to Iraq, working for Public affairs with the Army. Our job was simple there, take pictures of the soldiers doing soldier things and make the military look like we were fighting the good fight. It was an amazing job and I loved every second of it. But after a while on your 8 month rotation you start to get bored. So unbelievably bored. To the point where you and your buddies take up bad habits. Habits like smoking. 

I quickly learned that the locals working on base could provide us with anything but alcohol. The one thing they could provide however was weed. Lots and lots of weed. Assuming that most people know this, I will still state that the military has a strict zero tolerance policy to smoking anything beyond a cigarette and even that will get you some pouty looks from the senior enlisted, as if they never smoked anything in their life. After my 7th month on deployment I realized that this habit would ruin my career with the military and put me right back where I started before I joined. A drug addicted loser struggling to get by. Before I left my deployment I talked with the medical staff on ways to kick my “cigarette habit” before I returned home. They had several recommendations such as meditation, nicotine gum, toothpicks, regular gum, and checking myself into a program in the military that was essentially rehab. The last one was of course career suicide as if you go to this clinic you would be marked as “Un-fit to fight” and again would put me back at square one. 

	To solve this problem I snagged a vape from one of the locals with 0% THC and 5% Nicotine content. At first the bright object burned my throat, but over time the slight warm buzzing feeling in my brain made me feel funny and happy, reminding me of the sensation of smoking weed. Flash forward to 3 years later at the end of my 4 year contract and I was still addicted. I developed a nasty cough that made running an issue. I had several headaches from over exposure to nicotine and got irritable when I couldn't take a smoke break every 15 minutes. Near the final months of my contract I went in for my final physical to some interesting news. Popcorn lung. A condition that I was still in the infancy stages of. A condition that causes you to have a nasty cough, be fatigued frequently, wake up with night sweats, and can even make your eyes and mouth swell to a nasty degree. So After getting this news and failing my most recent physical training test my unit pushed for my “early retirement” and banned me from reenlisting. This of course was terrible news but the upside of a VA check every month post military would soften the blow. Now smoking had essentially ruined my career and I was back to square one. 

Upon retiring from the military I moved back in with my parents and got a job working at my dads construction firm. Carrying bags of cement and knocking down walls. Hard work which of course would often send me into coughing fits in between hits of my vape, still chasing that sweet sensation from the first hit all those years later. 

	My mornings on days off would go something like this. I would wake up sweating in my childhood room. Laying in a bed I was too big for, reaching for the water I placed strategically on my nightstand as I coughed slightly. I’d take a sip of relief and sit up rubbing my head from the constant headaches before moving over to my desk where I would sit idle for the rest of the day. Hours of internet browsing and hitting my vape, forgetting to eat most of the time until dinner. Most people don’t know this but nicotine is an appetite suppressant, meaning it makes you forget to eat most of the time. Makes sense why so many models smoke.

 At first I tried everything to quit. I even tried those methods the doctor recommended all those years ago but every time I tried to meditate or not think about it instead I felt myself reaching for my vape with my eyes closed, almost subconsciously. The Nicotine gum was the next thing I tried but it just made me sick causing me to immediately drop that. I even went back to weed but something about it just didn’t feel the same so that didn’t work either. Seeing that I was no longer military, the rehab center was no longer available to me and I doubted the VA would assist with vape addiction. I was stuck in a never ending loop of feeling sorry for myself and doing nothing to change. In the end, it truly was my fault.

Every now and then I would look things up on how to quit. Searching for a new wave idea of dealing with the craving and the constant headaches. Wishing silently that someone would just make a version of a vape that gives you the same effects but doesn't kill you slowly. When finally a new solution presented itself in the best way possible. Say what you will about targeted ads, but one day I saw one that peaked my interest and possibly had the solution I was getting desperate for. It was a quit smoking program run out of a rehab center near my town. After clicking on the ad I was greeted with a website that looked to be from 2009 with how poorly it was made. At the top of the page was text that read “Gerry Gardens, X out the addiction and resume your life's fiction!”

“Corny.” I scoffed alone in my room, my own voice echoing off the walls. I hit my vape.

It had a picture of a small hospital-like building with green blankets of grass surrounding it and 2 people wearing all white standing in the entrance smiling holding their hands up to form an “X” with their index fingers. 

“Creepy.” I thought, taking another puff of the sweet flavor.

After some more time on their website I was brought to a page called “our testimonials”. A picture of an older man wearing the same white clothes was on the left of the page with a scroll of text next to him. The text read as follows. 

“Are you living your life how you want to? Happy with the way things are? No? Well neither was I until I found out how to “X” the poisons out of my life here at Gerry Gardens Rehab program for the small stuff!” 

Scrolling further I read that he had been addicted to smoking and after just a week at Gerry Gardens he never touched a cigarette again for the past 35 years. Sounded like bullshit. I scrolled down and read another excerpt from another patient. A thin young woman who was very attractive. Her text read as follows. 

“The “X” in my life was nail biting! I know! Something so simple yet so hard to stop! Here at Gerry Gardens they showed me a better way to use my hands!”

Further down the page was another man, he looked young, maybe in his 20s, doing the same “X” Symbol as the rest. 	“Porn addiction is no laughing matter, it was a small “X” in my life and here at Gerry Gardens no problem was too small for them to help. I’m better now, I promise!”



	Strange? Weird? Yes to both but at the same time, dealing with something like smoking, nail biting and even porn addiction seemed to be normal problems most Americans have. Problems so small but if left unchecked could affect your life. Maybe this was what I needed? Help. I hit my vape. 

  


After a couple of days of waking up coughing, tired, and angry I decided to call them. Pulling their number for the closet location to me from their website, I was met with the jingle of a small tune. Chimes and low drums in a rhythmic pattern played until it was abruptly stopped by a voice over phone. The voice was smooth and dream-like, belonging to a man. 

“Gerry Gardens, how may I be of service on this fine Wednesday?”

“Uh, hi, my name is Ryan, Ryan Vonder. I was calling about your services and all you offer.” I spoke, a little embarrassed but still determined to quit smoking. I hit my vape. 

“Ryan, Hello I am Nathan. What is the X in your life?” He spoke softly but clearly and with purpose, his routine probably rehearsed thousands of times. 

“Smoking, but like, vapes not cigarettes. Is there any way you all would be able to help me? I’ve tried everything.”	The line was quiet for a moment except for the scribbling of a pencil and the sound of me hitting my vape, then he spoke again. 	“Yes Ryan, it would be my pleasure to help you. Let's talk about your methods you have tried and choose the best plan for you.”

I won’t lie, his voice calmed me, soon it was like I was chatting with an old friend. The silence broken up by his pencil scribbling down all of my information and ways I had tried to stop. The end of the call came sooner than expected as Nathan gave me directions to the Gerry Gardens near me, recommending that I go and see a facility for myself where he would be there to personally see to my treatment. I thanked him and hung up the phone.

Thursday morning I explained to my parents that I was checking myself in for rehab at a facility over the weekend that was about 3 hours from the house near the coast. My father assumed it was for drugs but I explained it was for my vaping addiction. My parents, who were heavy smokers, shared a look of disbelief and laughed with a slight cough near the end. My mother finished her laugh as she simply walked out of the room into the backyard and smoked her morning cigarette, while my father looked back at the TV.

“Never got why you never thought to just switch to cigarettes, it's manlier anyways.” He held up his hand and with a wave he said nothing more.

 Annoyed with my parents' response, I scribbled the facilities number and address on a notepad and walked out. 

The drive to the facility was nice, it was near a coast with a clear view of the ocean from the highway. Along the highway was a forest that seemed to spawn from nowhere. In Between the trees was a winding road that was covered in old brick and stone. Along the path was a sign that looked weathered but recently painted. It read “Gerry Gardens 1980”. I assumed it was the year that Gerry Gardens had opened. I pulled down the long stretch of road as my music began to cut in and out due to the lack of service on my phone. The further I drove down the path the more I realized that I felt, just, nice. Better than I had felt in years. I was taking my first steps towards getting actual help in breaking my addiction. My heart thumped in a smooth rhythmic pattern until I found myself almost subconsciously turning off the radio and listened to the rumble of the engine. I was snapped out of my trance-like state as I stopped my car at the gate to Gerry Gardens. 

The gates were large, made of iron and the top of them had silver, sharp spikes which glinted the sun into my eyes. The gates were attached to large brick walls that must have been 15 feet high painted pure white to hide the red bricks they were built with. To the left of the gates was a small intercom that was clean without a single cobweb or scratch on it, with a large inviting red button that read “call”. A CCTV camera moved and tracked my car as I drove next to the button. I found myself eagerly pressing the button from the driver's seat and the same soft melody played from the phone until I heard a familiar voice. 

	“Ryan, we have been expecting you.” Nathan said in a soft voice.

“Please park to the left and bring your bags inside.”

The entrance to the building was nothing like the website. It had a deck with several empty rocking chairs and two wooden double doors that had gold trim. The entire building was white with no windows on the front at all. The building had several cameras around the sides that lead to the edges of the building and I would assume lead to the back. The door, while looking heavy, was rather light and easy to open. Cold air inside rushed my face as I was greeted by a lobby. Tan walls with early 2000’s furniture and small tables in between them. Brochure racks holding custom made pamphlets about all types of afflictions and how to deal with them scattered the room as well. It was neat, almost like someone with OCD had made the room as perfect and inviting as possible. Near the end of the room was a sliding glass door with a window next to it. Behind the counter was a tall man with long hair in a ponytail smiling at me. I jumped slightly not remembering if I saw him when I first came in and he didn’t flinch as I approached. His hair was Blonde and his eyes a deep blue. The kind of blue that would almost hypnotize you if you stared too long. His outfit was similar to the ones I had seen on the website but had gold accents around the neck and short sleeves.

“Ryan, a pleasure to finally meet you.” He said through a smile.

“Nathan? Nice to meet you man,” I stuck out my hand to shake his and he looked down at it. For what felt like a minute he looked at it then slowly met mine and shook it firmly. His hands were callused and rough. 

“Welcome to Gerry Gardens, I assume the drive was pleasant?”

“Yes! It was lovely, quite the location you all have out here. I uh, couldn’t help but notice the reception is not the best though.” I looked at him hoping for a WIFI code or something.	“There is a reason for that, all part of the treatment of course,” He said in the same dream-like tone. 

“Now then if you are to check in just for the weekend as we talked about over the phone there are some rules you must follow while here.”

He slid over a legal document and a piece of paper with rules written at the top. The document was your usual legal mumbo jumbo that if I was injured on the ground or had a negative effect from treatment I couldn’t sue. For the record there was nothing in there that would have made me not sign or run out of the building. I wish I had. Before I signed the document Nathan tapped the paper containing the rules and spoke to me in a more serious tone while still retaining his dream-like speech patterns.

“The rules are law here, if you sign up for the treatment you must follow them and never break them no matter the situation. Life or death, you will respect them while you are here or you will be removed from the grounds.” 

I shook my head in agreement and began to pursue the rules while thinking to myself it was odd how I saw no other cars in the parking lot besides 3 white vans and a bright red compact. In fact the building was so quiet it might as well have been empty except for the two of us. The rules were bulleted and quite simple. 	Rule 1: Do not run or sprint unless instructed to by a nurse

Rule 2: Do not engage in your X’s unless instructed by a nurse

Rule 3: Do not talk to other patients when they are receiving treatment unless instructed by a nurse

Rule 4: Do no not leave the grounds until you are instructed by a nurse

Rule 5: Do not carry anything sharp unless instructed by a nurse.

The list goes on for a little bit more, usually ending with “unless instructed by a nurse”. I browsed them until I saw a rule that surprised me. 	

Rule 18: Do not harm anyone unless instructed by a nurse

“Nathan, what does this rule mean?” I asked innocently. Trying to gage his reaction to see if he was nervous about the question, 

“That is for the safety of all members here, in the event of an emergency we would hate to see you defend yourself unless you had to. For example if someone attacked you in the hallway, which is unlikely, the nurses will protect you and keep you safe, you are here to relax not fight.” He responded with the same smile.

 The line sounded almost scripted but with the environment and his smile I felt at ease. After finishing the rules I reached for a pen and signed my name on the line that said “I am willing to remove my X” and slid the papers over to him. He examined the paper, signed on his own line and then placed them in a folder with my name on it, a rather thick folder. 

“Now that we have finished the paperwork, allow me to walk you to your room and then we shall change your clothes and have our first session.” Nathan said as he walked around the corner hitting a small button that slid open the glass door. When I walked in I expected to see Nathan but instead it was a short wall separating me from him, at about chest height was clear glass with holes that allowed us to speak to each other as he walked. 

“Follow me, please,” He said, still holding the folder close to his chest. 

The hall seemed to go on longer than I expected, every step I grew more tired stopping myself on several occasions from hitting my vape. The floors were a glossy white and the tan of the lobby walls stretched into the long seemingly endless hallway. At the end of the glass path, Nathan’s ended with a wooden door while in my path was a four way junction. Nathan walked out of the wooden door with an electronic beep. He was now standing next to me and pointed at the long colored stripes that lead in the different paths. 

“Your X will determine your path, you are blue, please only go to the blue areas. Yellow and Red are for different X’s.” He explained. 

“Like what?” I asked. 

“Our more troubled patients who wished to be checked in longer.” He smiled and began walking down the blue path. 

The deeper we got into the blue path the walls began to shift to a light bluish color, Nathan explained that all the rooms I could be in were marked blue like this. I found myself having a hard time keeping up with his long, almost mechanical strides. We got to my room and he turned to me, handing me a small white badge with my room number and my name on it. 

“This is your badge, it will grant you access to the outdoor area, cafeteria, and bath center. Restrooms are in your room, lights out at 9pm and the cafeteria is 24/7 but hot meals are served at 7am, 11am, and 5pm respectively. I shall see you tomorrow, sleep well, tonight you may indulge in your X until I see you again.” As quickly as he explained everything he was gone.

The room was tiny but comfy, in the corner was a small door leading to a bathroom with a shower and toilet. The sink sat near the door on the outside of the restroom and the walls were a deep blue. Near the bed was a night stand with a lamp and a small landline. The bed had a sturdy bounce to it as I tossed my duffel onto the mattress. The single soft warm light lit the room from the ceiling reflecting light off the frosted glass of a window I could hardly see through. I hit my vape and opened the window to see what I assumed was the courtyard. Thick Iron bars hung from the outside of my window in near perfect condition. The appearance of the facility was so sterile and clean, even more than a hospital. Outside I could see a courtyard with Red paint all over the ground, similar to the walls further down the Red hall. There was a small basketball court with benches and tables to the side of the court sporting chess boards. There was no one in sight, it was a quiet, serene scene. 

I began changing into the outfit I found in the dresser I slipped on the white shoes they provided, and remarked how perfect everything fit me. I didn’t remember telling Nathan anything about my shoe size or even my shirt size for that matter. Maybe they assumed my size at the entrance by sight? They had people do that when we got issued our uniforms in the military so it wasn’t that far fetched to me, still, very strange. I looked in the mirror and examined the outfit. I looked like a walking, talking bottle of bleach with a brown cap instead of a blue one. I ran my fingers through my beard and examined my tired visage. I snapped a picture of myself with my phone and walked to the door, hitting my vape one more time before leaving it in my room laying on my dresser. 

On entering the hallway I looked at the clock near my room, it was about 10:45AM and I turned to the right and followed the signs marked “cafeteria”. I was not terribly hungry but with no WIFI and no service I was desperately looking for something to do. Rounding the corner to the cafeteria, I bumped into a person wearing the same outfit as me. 	“Oh sorry!” The woman said sweetly. “I just have been really into this book and oh well uh sorry.” 

She was a little taller than me and had long flowing red dyed hair and was holding a book in one hand. Her smile was sweet and soft with perfect teeth say for yellow stains all too common of a smoker.

“No it's not your fault, I was just not paying attention is all. I'm Ryan.” I said, taking the blame and stretching my hand out to greet hers. She shook it eagerly.

“Well Ryan, my name's Stacy and if I'm being honest I really thought I was the only one here.” She looked into the empty cafeteria and then back to me, “it’s nice to see a friendly face!”

“Back at ya, I was about to sit and maybe eat a little something, care to join me or are you heading somewhere?” I questioned and moved out of the hall into the cafeteria not seeing a single staff member in sight.

“Sure I’ll sit for a little! Grab your food and I'll wait over here,” she smiled revealing her yellow stained teeth again.

She picked a booth near the door and put her nose back into the book she was reading. As I walked away I tried to read the title but saw no words anywhere on cover or the back for that matter. I walked the short distance to the food line facing a worker who looked very similar to Nathan. Short blond hair with blue eyes that sucked you in when he spoke. 

“Hello, how may I assist you today?” He smiled. He was wearing the same type of outfit that Nathan had on with a name tag that read Heath. His speech pattern was just as dreamy as Nathan’s. 

“Uh I’ll just have a burger, no tomatoes please.” I replied. 

With a slight nod of acknowledgement he turned and began cooking on the grill whistling the tune that I heard in the lobby and on the phone, I began to slightly lose track of time, watching the burger sizzle until my brain reminded me to hit my vape. I shook my head at the thought expecting the usual headache but it never came. I then saw Heath walk to me and looked at the plate being handed to me. The food looked amazing, probably due to my lack of eating anything all morning. 	“On the house as always,” He chuckled, pleased with his own joke. 

I thanked him and began walking back to Stacy who looked as though she hadn’t moved an inch since I walked away.

 Although she was tall her frame was small, she looked anorexic to a degree and had a subtle whiff of a perfume that mixed with the smell coming from Heath’s grill. She noticed me getting closer and folded in the corner of the page she was on and set her book down. 

	“Whatcha get?” She asked with a smile. 

“Just a burger, but I'm kinda a plain jane guy,” I remarked as I lifted the bun revealing just a lonely piece of cheese. She chuckled. After her laugh filled the room it was silent again except for the faint hum of the ceiling lights.

“So, what are you in for? If you don’t mind me asking?” I questioned. 	

Her brown eyes shifted to her right and on the table laid a lighter bright pink with a small design on it. I nodded in understanding.

“I’ve tried everything I could to stop but I saw one of those ads online and just well, thought, what the hell! Sucks that I have to take time off work.” She replied with a hint of sarcasm. It was clear that my question had upset her so I quickly tried to change the subject. 

“Oh uh, what do you do for work?”

“Nothing too special,” Stacy replied, “I work at a daycare. I know I know, the daycare worker who smokes?! I must be a bad influence!”

I laughed, like a real one, not a fake laugh like a first date although that's what this was beginning to feel like. I decided to finally voice my opinion with someone else on the strangeness of this place. I leaned in and spoke in a whisper. 

“Kinda creepy facility? Like something you would see in a horror movie huh?” I said, praying that she would get the vibe I was sending. She did, and leaned in as well. 

“It's not that strange, the last one I was in for-” She stopped herself mid sentence and gave me a cold glare, “Sorry I....well sometimes I just over share is all, but truth be told I’ve seen worse rehab facilities before.”

We talked for a couple more hours until I realized it was already 3pm. We discussed movies, the latest celebrity craze, and even the weather (lame I know). Stacy ended the conversation and began to gather herself to walk to the door, I followed and said my goodbyes and gave a handshake. It seemed like I had at least a friend here for the time being. 

Walking back to my room was when I first felt it. The urge, kicking in my head telling me to hit my vape again. I could sometimes trick myself into not doing it or just distract myself with a game or even reading but I had nothing of the sort in my tiny closet I called my room. The urge only grew more when I saw the vape sitting on my bed. I picked it up immediately and was about to take a hit when I stopped myself. Had I left it on the bed? Surely I must have, and then I remembered the badge that Nathan wore. Maybe he was in my room? Was this a test? To see how I would react to it being moved? Maybe he poisoned it, or even removed the juice. All these thoughts were in the end just thoughts. I hit my vape once more and the urge went away. The subtle buzz returned and I laid on my bed in silence. 

I woke up the next morning early around 6am, sweaty with a tickle in my throat like usual. I hopped in the shower, brushed my teeth and got dressed in the bathroom. I walked out to find Nathan standing in the doorway holding my folder. He was so silent and still his presence made my heart jump, I hadn’t even heard him enter. I stared at him and his wide toothy perfect smile.

“Good morning,” he started, “I trust you slept well?”

“Yeah, more or less, I didn’t even hear you come in. Good thing I wasn’t naked or something.” I tried, but he didn’t laugh. Instead he walked into the hall and without facing me and said, "Please, finish getting ready and meet me out here. Also take your X with you. You will; need it today.” 

His sentence was surprising. I was here to stop vaping after all, why would I need to take my “X” with me? I slipped my shoes on and walked to the door. I hit my vape, then stepped into the hall and followed Nathan.

We arrived at one of the doors I passed on the way to my room yesterday. It was marked as “Cog/Func checks”. The door was as white as everything else besides the light blue walls. 

“Inside please, our doctor will administer a test to see what methods will work best with you,” He said as he extended his hand, opening the door and beckoning me inside. I walked into the room which was all white with a small table in the middle. Two chairs surrounded the table but not across from each other, they were side by side. On the table was a small device made of gray plastic, it looked like a headset of sorts, with small holes on the sides to hear from and a cord running to the ceiling. In the corner of the room a man who stood, motionless, his white outfit the same as Nathan’s almost making him blend into the wall. He sported the same toothy grin that all the workers had. 

“Hello.” He said from the pure white corner, his voice was nothing like Nathan’s. It was gruff and mean, serious enough that even off a simple hello I was put on edge.

“Please, take a seat and then I will join you.” 

I nervously walked to the table and sat in the chair with the headset in front of it. As soon as I sat down the man walked over without swinging his arms. He looked down at the chair and slid it out just enough to sit in. His every movement was calculated, smooth and alien like. Up close I studied the man's face. He sported the same eye color as Nathan, a deep blue. His hair was blond as well, with what looked like tufts of gray peeking out from the blonde folds. His hair was a combover to hide the fact he was balding but I saw no wrinkles on his face. He then turned and without breaking his smile and said,

“Removing someone’s X can be a tricky process, it is the very nature of why I so enjoy my job. Today, you may call me doctor. Now, place the headset on and we may begin cognitive function testing.”

I looked at the plastic headset and was hesitant, I would kill for the buzz of nicotine right now. As I placed the headset on I felt the drops of sweat on my head. I slid the headset into place and the entire room went black. I heard some papers rustling and then Doctor spoke,

“I see your X is, hmm, vaping. Interesting, why not cigarettes?”

“Well I-” before I could say anything he cut me off.

“Do not speak unless I ask for a reply,” He said sternly, reminding me of a former sergeant I had, “It is very important that you not speak unless I say the phase “input”. Do you understand? Input.”

“Yes I understand.” I replied. 

“Good, now let us begin.”

Suddenly the room was light again, a deep gray that filled the screen of the headset. 3 Boxes appeared in front of me spinning slightly as the low hum of the electronics in the headset whirred with excitement. 

“The three boxes, which would you choose and why? Input.” He  barked.

“Uh I guess the one in the middle?” I replied meekly, unsure of my own response. I heard some scribbling of a pen on his papers. Then the boxes left, replaced by 3 different objects. On the left was a gun, the middle was a fan, and the third was a keyboard. “Out of all of the objects shown, which would you use to change how you feel? Input.” Doctor said.

“The fan I suppose.” I was unsure as to what this would be even testing, the items seemed random and the longer I stared at them the sillier this whole thing felt. 

“Right then, now we will have you use your X and see how it affects your brain. Pull out your vape and hit it please.”

I was greeted by the sweet nicotine buzz as I hit it and suddenly the environment shifted in the headset. I was now in a bedroom on a chair looking at a closed door. 

“Describe how you feel, input.” He said.

“Good, relaxed, comfortable I guess.” I replied, again not understanding how it would cure me of my X. Suddenly the door crept open slowly and a lone hand crept around the frame, nails long and unkempt, a deep black. 

“Um I, there is something there, at the door I mean.”

“Interesting just experience it please, do not speak.” Doctor said with a slight hushed tone as if he didn’t want the hand to know he was even there. 

The thing’s hand crept back into the door frame and into the blackness. I was still for a moment and my heart rate jumped a little. The screen then flashed several times with a brightness that made it uncomfortable to even look at the screen. I shifted in my seat as the flashes hurt my eyes.

“Keep your eyes open,” Doctor whispered, sounding inches away from me, “Experience it.”

The urge to hit my vape again came, and with it the flashes, burning my eyes as I stared into the screen. It was painful at first but then mesmerizing. I must have sat with the headset on replaying the door over and over again for at least 5 mins, until finally I could take no more. I closed my eyes and the flashing stopped. I felt the cool fingers of the Doctor remove the headset. My eyes adjusted as I looked and saw him smiling unmoved as if he never had.

“Your results are wonderful, you will be able to remove your X after all. That will be all for today, this can be quite daunting for a newcomer. Nathan, I'm done with Ryan for today please escort him away.” With those final words I blinked and he was gone, I didn’t even see him leave the room as I felt a hand on my upper back. I stood up wobbly and faced Nathan.

“Come on Ryan, I will take you to your room, you will need plenty of rest after this.”

I wanted to ask him what kind of therapy or science bullshit that was but I couldn’t even form a thought that was coherent enough to speak, so I hobbled to a wheelchair he had by the door and collapsed into it. Every blink was time I lost. Blink one, I was in the hall. Blink two, Nathan handed me some food. Blink three I was laying in my bed staring at the ceiling. The best way to describe how I felt was like if I had been in a car wreck and dunked my head in a bucket of ice water. It was messy, confusing and at the time even had a hard time recalling my name. Then I heard the song again, the subtle hums and rhythmic beats soothed my mind as I fell into a deep sleep.
