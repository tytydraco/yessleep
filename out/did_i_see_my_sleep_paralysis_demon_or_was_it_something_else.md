first of all i just woke up from an awful nightmare that consisted of my family and friends fooling and betraying me, there was a lot more to the dream but it’s not important, i apologise in advance if my writing doesn’t make a whole lot of sense

when i woke up, for a split second i saw a face. it had skin like those mexican hairless dogs but much darker, almost black but still grey and it had the same texture as those dogs. it had long black hair all over its face and head, kind of like a werewolf but it was in tufts revealing the skin and i could see every stand of hair because it was very thick like almost the thickness of a thin spaghetti noodle. it had completely yellow eyes that were shaped cartoonishly, they were like triangles but the base bent up like the top of a triangle would but they weren't pointy like a triangle is, i guess it was like a kidney bean shape but slimmer and longer, it was grinning so that definitely played a part with the eye shape. it had huge wet pointed teeth that were long and overlapped so that some stuck out past its gums, similar to an angler fish and they reflected in the very little light i could see it in. for its nose and overall face shape i couldn’t tell because it was like i saw it in moonlight and it was extremely close to me, i couldn’t hear or smell it. 

in the past i’ve had five experiences with sleep paralysis, two of the five times i have seen a dark figure that i wasn’t able to make out. the past sleep paralysis experiences i’ve had felt longer than just a split second, more like 3-6 seconds. however, the last time i might’ve had sleep paralysis (which i don’t count in the five above) was about four months ago and it was similar to what just happened, it lasted for a split and i saw a dark figure in the doorway of my room, it didn’t last long enough for me to move which is why im unsure of if its sleep paralysis or something else. 

the timing of this is what’s really strange, im moving out of my apartment and just finished packing up the last of my stuff, i decided to stay the night at my old apartment before taking it to my new house as i was exhausted and the drive is over an hour long. usually, i just don’t think about these things when it happens but tonight was different, i think it showed its face to say goodbye or to give me one last scare as some kind of last hoorah for it, i think it might be worth mentioning that the person im moving in with is a christian. anyway, i felt obligated to write about this as it was terrifying and thought i’d share in case anyone has had a similar experience
