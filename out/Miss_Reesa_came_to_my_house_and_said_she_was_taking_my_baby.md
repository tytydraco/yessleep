My daughter Anne is obsessed with Sing Along with Miss Reesa. It’s one of those baby shows that seems engineered in a lab to capture their attention: soft colors, friendly puppet characters, lots of baby sign language, and a grown woman with a sweet voice who speaks slowly, clearly, and gently, like she’s genuinely speaking to the little ones through the screen.

We started watching it when Anne was around five months old. I was skeptical at first, but the moment she saw Miss Reesa for the first time, her face lit up. She started squealing and reaching toward the screen. Her favorite song is “Icky Sticky Bubblegum.” She laughs so hard she snorts every time Miss Reesa sings, “Stick it to your... belly!” It’s adorable.

My husband and I started watching with her just to enjoy her joy. There’s something really comforting about the show. I’ve even caught myself humming the songs when I’m doing dishes or folding laundry. It became a little ritual for the three of us.

So when we found out Miss Reesa was doing a live performance just a few towns over, we bought tickets immediately. The event was marketed as baby-friendly with a live singalong and photo ops afterward. The meet-and-greet came with a waiver we had to fill out at the venue—our names, address, phone number, Anne’s age, height, weight, and vaccine status. It seemed a little excessive, but I didn’t question it. I figured it was for safety or liability.

The show was magical. Anne was completely enchanted, bouncing and clapping and babbling with excitement. When we got to meet Miss Reesa, she knelt down, looked Anne right in the eyes, and said, “Hi, sweet girl! Are you ready to sing with me?” Anne reached for her without hesitation.

We took a few pictures—just the two of them, then one with the three of us. Miss Reesa’s smile never dropped. It didn’t shift between photos. It was like it had been pasted onto her face.

I felt a little weird about it afterward, but I told myself I was being paranoid.

The next morning, there was a knock at the door.

I wasn’t expecting anyone. I opened it in my pajamas.

Miss Reesa was standing there.

Not someone dressed like her. Her. Same clothes. Same hairstyle. Same voice.

“Hi, Marisol!” she said, bright as ever. “I’m here to take your baby!”

I laughed. “Wait, what?”

She smiled wider. “I’m taking your baby. She’ll be better off with me than with you.”

She brushed past me like she owned the place and walked straight to Anne, who was in her playpen. My daughter lit up, squealed, and reached for her like they were old friends.

Miss Reesa picked her up. “There we go. That’s better.”

I panicked. “You can’t do this! Give her back!”

“You signed the form,” she said.

“That wasn’t permission for this!”

“She wants to come with me,” she said, rocking Anne gently. “I can give her everything you can’t.”

I begged her. I cried. “Please take someone else’s baby. I know parents who don’t care. Take their babies. Just not mine.”

She tilted her head. “Mama is so silly.”

Then a yellow cab pulled up to the curb.

She got in with my baby and drove away.

No one believes me. There are no records of the event. The venue says no such show ever took place. The website for Sing Along with Miss Reesa has been deleted. Every time I try to post about it, the message vanishes.

But last night, I got a text from an unknown number.

No message. Just a photo.

Anne, sitting on a colorful carpet, smiling.

Behind her, Miss Reesa, still smiling that same fixed smile, holding up a sign.

It said: Mama is so silly.
