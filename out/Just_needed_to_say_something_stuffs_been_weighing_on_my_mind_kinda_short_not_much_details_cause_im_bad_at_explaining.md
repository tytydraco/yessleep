I MEANT KINDA LONG WHOOPS- (o\_o)  


I feel like, for this story, we're gonna have to start at the beginning.

For basically all of my life up to fourth grade, I had been living up in northeastern US, including Ohio. pretty normal life, pretty normal parents, pretty normal friends. Just a weird kid who trusts people too easily. Moved around a bit, but stayed close to family.But, of course, my dad's job wasn't able to support us anymore, They were moving locations, and wouldn't be employing him anymore. I had to live with my grandma for about half of my fourth-grade year. Maybe it was my friends I made while I was there that did it to me, their interest in the paranormal rubbing off on my subconcious or something, I honestly have no clue.

Eventually, my dad found an apartment for us to stay in. It was all the way in northern Alabama, a big change for someone who grew up with snow up to their chin every winter. The place was pretty empty when we first moved in, just a cheap 2-foot-tall christmas tree on an empty floor, poorly wrapped presents pretty much covering the bottom half up. It was a good time, and life moved on. I made new friends, and I started finding my footing in my existance. Art had always been my passion since i was old enough to hold a crayon, and it became the way I made a lot of good friends.

In the beginning of my 5th grade year, I believe, I started seeing and feeling things. noticing disturbances in the air out of the corner of my eye. hearing random bits and peices of words out of nowhere in an empty room. but most importantly, I saw the figure.A taller man, probably late twenties to mid thirties, a complete shadow except for his faintly grey eyes i could sometimes see. not neceserally sleep paralysis, but more of a watching figure. he would go away if i moved, and i only saw him at night if i was having trouble sleeping. he would always approach from the right side of my bed, and would just stand silently next to my bed. He had shorter hair, and looked like maybe he wore a sweater or something, his shoulders were very strong. I dubbed him Caleb, but I didn't tell anyone about him, I was afraid they wouldn't believe me or they'd hate me, I was a worrier. Eventually, we found a nice house not too far away, but in a different school, where I would soon make some new, better friends. but that aside, I'm pretty sure he knew or realised this, because in roughly the last month or two of me staying in that apartment, he reached over me, hesitated, pat my head, and exited the room. his touch was cold but vaguely comforting, and I never saw him again.

After I moved to the new house, I started feeling almost instantly things were off. within the first week of staying there, I heard disembodied howling from our backyard. I later found a gravestone for someone's dead dog in our backyard.For about the majority of my sixth grade year, I was seeing things, specifically this brown-and-white hound dog, definately male, who would just stare at me. cold eyes, like i was an intruder. I had a friend come over to my house one night, and they saw him, too. I made dead eye contact with him for about five minutes once when I went to go get a snack from the fridge. he seemed like he was sizing me up, judging me. noth threatening, but not friendly.About two or three times I saw a woman fly by my vision. long balck hair, cold, pale skin, but she wore a purple t-shirt and jeans. her body was hung like she was being held by her neck, like she had hung herself or something. always a blur, but came in a consistent direction, from my bedroom towards the living room.after about three or four months, things died down, the dog wasn't judging me anymore, and the strange childlike cries i heard from my bathroom stopped.

But the school I went to definately had a spirit or two, specifically the gym.

There was a faceless entity I saw a couple times climbing through the vents above me, long fingers, it looked starved from what i could see. and there were definately a couple of times i would zone out and find my arm doing it's own crap. one time, me and my friends did a test, in the gym, and just layed out a peice of pen and paper, and waited. we left it under the bleachers, and stayed nearby, monitoring it. while we didn't exactly see who did it, we found, after about ten minutes, a very shaky drawing of a river and a tree, where a dead body layed. funny thing is, the schoolyard ran by a small creek.Though we let our imaginations run wild sometimes, I'm pretty certain there's a spirit or two at that middle school.

Of recently, I've been talking aloud to myself late at night, and not too long ago had a response. I've helped other friends with encounters with spirits at other places, which i would tell but this is going on long enough, but this entity, it actually physically *touches me.* like, straight up, grabs my shoulder touches me. I can't see it, or at least not well, but it's there, definately. classic knocking on walls as a yes or no type crap, thats what I'm talking about. I don't know many good methods of communication with spirits, and it keeps grabbing me, leaving faint marks. I can feel its gaze, it feels warm, and when it touches me, it's like that feeling when your brain thinks there's spiders on your skin, but like warm? and really concentrated in the area that it touches me. It's not done anything bad to me, just grabbing my arms/shoulders, patting me on the back, but I do think it's at least tried to sleep in my bed at least twice. I know this is long and it goes on a tangent and has no good conclusion, but I don't know how to deal with this "new guy". I don't have a strong emotional feeling when it's around, other than it's eyes on me. It's only in my room, and It usually stays at my back or to my sides. I know it's bigger than me from the size of its hands and the direction its gaze comes from, but what should I do? all of these spirits have been in the same general area, about a thirty minute drive between the farthest ones, am I going crazy? I tried to talk to my Councelor about it but she just brushed it off as my imagination when I tried to bring it up.

Am I crazy?

Or is it something else?

And most importantly, can anyone help me?
