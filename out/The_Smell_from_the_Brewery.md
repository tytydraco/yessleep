Judson Mill used to be one of Greenville’s old textile complexes: brick, smokestack, the whole deal. A few years back, they turned it into one of those mixed-use redevelopments: cafés, offices, apartments, and a brewery. I picked up some part-time work at the Judson Mill Play Café, a massive indoor playground and café spread over a couple of stories: slides, climbing nets, the works, packed every afternoon with kids and parents. Right across the hall was the brewery.

Weeknights there always wind down the same way: mop, stack, espresso rinse, lights off by 6:58. Across the hall, the brewery hummed through its last run. You could set your watch by the steam off their vents.

Then, over a few weeks, something shifted. The smell started changing. At first just a faint note under the hops, something sweeter, heavier, like fruit turning soft. The condensation on the windows darkened, sticky instead of wet. Then the air coming through the cracks felt damp, animal, almost sweet; the smell of fruit left in a trunk. Tiny mushrooms pressed up through the rubber seam of the play mat. I scrubbed them with sanitizer till the bleach stung my eyes. They came back the next morning.

Derek, who’d started picking up night shifts next door at the brewery, changed too. He used to whistle when he cleaned the foam wands. Now he muttered. One night he said, real quiet, “It’s alive, you know.” His hands looked waxy. His smile, soft. He said it was his grandfather’s gift. “Grandfather’s been generous lately.” He said. And laughed in a way that didn’t sound like him. I thought maybe the new yeast strain was doing something to his sinuses.

Then came the evacuation.

Men in dark jackets; not hazmat, not police, not anything marked; came through in a line. The leader was tall, sharp, and steady. His voice was smooth and precise, practiced to calm a crowd.

“We're with OSHA. There’s been a pressurized line failure at the brewery. Possible CO₂ exposure. Everyone out through the back. Please stay calm.”

No panic, no alarms. They moved us along like we were part of a drill. The parents went first, and I was the tail end of the line.

As we turned the corner, something snapped from inside the brewery; a loud, metallic clang like a valve blowing off. Everyone jerked, but the tall man didn’t flinch. He raised a hand, halfway through some calm assurance, then something hit him.

From where I was, it looked like a spring, maybe a broken clamp or pipe fitting, launched by pressure. It struck his chest and staggered him half a step. He dropped to one knee, breath gusting. For one heartbeat, everything around him folded. The air shimmered wrong, like heat over asphalt, but sharper, like geometry itself had hiccupped.

That’s when I saw what it really was.

Not a spring. A hook of bone, spinning through the air from a hand, a man-shaped blur in an apron, its face sloughing like candle wax, its skin crawling with mold. The hook hit an invisible wall in front of the tall man and exploded into sour green mist. His lapel pin flickered, for a second I could’ve sworn it wasn’t the U.S. flag or agency seal at all, but a two-headed eagle.

He looked up, eyes blazing white for half a blink, and the wall rippled outward, shattering the hallway glass and making the overhead bulbs pop in a chain. The sound wasn’t sound; it was inside my head, heavy and sharp as migraine.

Through that shattered glimpse, I saw the inside of the brewery.

It wasn’t a line failure. The brewery tanks were bleeding. Pulsing. The floor was covered in a moving slick of things that had once been men in brewery shirts, now chanting, bending, splitting, laughing as they dissolved. Between them and us advanced black-armored giants, shoulders like refrigerators, weapons roaring light instead of bullets. Bolts of searing white lanced through the fog, cutting holes in walls, bodies, and air itself. Others advanced behind portable flame-throwers that spat rolling fire across the floor, burning out every wet shadow.

And lumbering between the brewery tanks was a thing that shouldn’t fit indoors, fat and joyful, skin split in rivers of pus, its grin wide enough to break the jaw it no longer had. It laughed, and the laugh turned the walls soft. One of the black-armored men met it head-on, his sword a slab of light. The air melted around them.

The tall man, the one who’d told us to evacuate, stood again. His outline warped like smoke, and for that one impossible second I saw him. Not tall, towering. Not human eyes, empty holes that drank in color. A storm was pressing behind his skull, and it was barely contained. His mouth opened, and for a blink, reality screamed.

Then, gone.

The hallway was a hallway. The lights buzzed, the parents were halfway out the door, and the tall man was brushing concrete dust from his jacket. He didn’t limp. He didn’t speak. But when I looked back, he was staring right at me, not my face, *me*. The kind of look that says you saw something you shouldn’t have, and we both know it.

They cleared the site, gave statements about “CO₂ buildup” and “pressure vessel fault.” We were told it was contained by “OSHA response specialists.” By Friday, everything looked normal again, normal enough to fool anyone who hadn’t seen the air tear itself open.

Three days later, the Upstate Business Journal ran this:

“Magnetic South Brewery at Judson Mill near downtown Greenville will close Sept. 28.  
‘We love you, Greenville,’ the post said. ‘Our time at Judson Mill has been an epic journey, but now it’s time for a new adventure…’”

No mention of line failure. No mention of evacuation or OSHA. Definitely no mention of… whatever all that was.

The play café reopened the next morning. Derek never came back.

They said everything was fine. They even buffed the floor where the hallway glass had shattered, though the polish never quite took. It’s dull there now, like light doesn’t want to stay.

Sometimes, when the HVAC kicks on, I catch a trace of that same sour-sweet rot. It’s faint, just enough to make me freeze mid-motion, just enough to remember the shimmer in the air and the noise that wasn’t a noise at all.

I haven’t told anyone what I saw. Not my coworkers, not the parents, not my family.

Because I know that if I do, if I tell anyone about the shapes I saw in that one impossible second, he’ll come back.

Not the men in jackets. Him.  
The tall one.

If I ever talk, I’ll disappear like the rest of them. The brewers, the managers, gone without a word. So I keep working, say nothing, and pretend I don’t notice how the air still carries that faint, sweet edge of decay.
