The apocalypse started on a Tuesday.

Not with fire. Not with war. Not with aliens blowing up the White House.

Just… weird shit.

People woke up and their reflections didn’t match. Buildings stretched too high, too thin. Street signs whispered when you walked past. And some people just disappeared. Like, poof. Gone.

I should’ve known things were bad when I stepped outside and the sky was the wrong color.

It wasn’t blue. It wasn’t gray. It was—I don’t know. Like a color I’d never seen before but somehow recognized.

Like when you hear a song you don’t remember but you know all the words.

Anyway. That was Day One.

By Day Three, reality was drunk off its ass.

Gravity started working on a freelance basis. Some people floated away like balloons. Others got stuck to the ground. The moon got way too close, like a nosy neighbor leaning over the fence. And the sun? Well.

There were two of them now.

By Day Five, most people were either dead, missing, or existentially broken.

Not me, though.

I had a plan.

Well. “Plan” is a strong word. More like a stolen shopping cart, a backpack full of canned goods, and a gun I found on a priest.

Listen. He wasn’t using it.

Probably.

The important thing is—I wasn’t sticking around.

See, there was a rumor going around. A safe place. A town that hadn’t been touched by all this Willy Wonka acid trip bullshit.

It was 500 miles east.

So that’s where I was headed.

Just me, my cart, and the rapidly deteriorating rules of reality.

And let me tell you—this road trip was gonna suck.

Day Seven
• The trees started talking. Not like, whispering creepy shit. Just small talk.
• The ocean was now inland and very, very angry about it.
• I found a dog!
• The dog spoke perfect English.
• He was also kind of an asshole.

Day Ten
• Met a guy with no face. He played the banjo. Pretty good, actually.
• The sun winked at me. I flipped it off. I think I hurt its feelings.
• The ground became water, but only when I wasn’t looking at it.
• Dog stole my last can of beans. I will never forgive him.

Day Fifteen
• Ran into a cult. They worship a giant floating eye.
• The eye tried to recruit me. I told it to fuck off.
• I am now being hunted by an omniscient celestial entity.
• On the bright side, found a Snickers bar.

Day Twenty
• The road turned into a Mobius strip. I walked for three days before realizing I was going in a loop.
• The Snickers bar had a pulse. I ate it anyway.
• Reality started cracking. Literally. There are holes in the world.
• I looked into one.
• Something looked back.

By Day Twenty-Five, I was starting to enjoy myself.

I mean, sure, existence was breaking down like a shitty bootleg DVD. But at this point, I’d seen so much mind-melting horror that I was kind of numb to it.

So when I finally reached the safe place—

I wasn’t even surprised that it was worse.

See, everyone was fine here.

Too fine.

No monsters. No sky meltdowns. No whispering shadows. Just people. Smiling. Perfect.

Too perfect.

I watched a woman burn her hand on a stove—no reaction. No flinch. Just a big, frozen smile.

I watched a man get hit by a car—he got back up, bones twisted wrong, and kept walking like nothing happened.

Then a kid ran up to me. Big, dead eyes.

He grabbed my hand.

And his fingers kept going.

Stretching. Wrapping around my wrist like rope.

He leaned in close.

“You don’t belong here.”

I yanked away, heart hammering. The whole town was staring at me now.

Still smiling.

Still wrong.

And that’s when I realized—

This wasn’t a safe place.

This was where reality went to die.

And I had just walked right in.
