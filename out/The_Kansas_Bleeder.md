The Kansas bleeder is not a killer, or a monster, but a phemenoma. To some, he is a gift from God, a miracle, to others, he’s a close friend, or a relative perhaps, and still to others, he’s a villain, a cold blooded killer, or the devil himself. He may appear as a tree, a man, a phone, a toy, an animal, anything you want to imagine, the Kansas bleeder has morphed into that. 

When I first heard of the Kansas bleeder, I didn't know what to think. I wouldn't necessarily call him evil, a monster to be avoided. But you should follow his rules, and make sure not to break them. His rules are very different for each person he meets, but his base rules are the same for each person that comes into contact with him. Here are the baseline rules:

Do not mention of the Kansas bleeder by ‘it’, call him like you would to anybody, some people even give him a name, like Steve or James other’s Call him ‘The last Disciple’ and ‘Prophet of God’
Never, ever, anger him. You will have a life of misery and pain, and He will torment you forever
Never disrespect the Kansas bleeder. Never talk back to Him or degrade him

Although these rules seem strange, I think I have an answer for it (that I cannot reveal to you right now). There are stories of him, a lot actually, that I have been able to get over the past 300 years. I have been able to digitize them here now, and I will share some stories with each post. Ok that’s all for now:

April 15, 1931:

“All of you, all of you have done evil to the sight of the lord, one way or another. God has sent this terrible dust bowl towards each of your farms, and has destroyed them and will KEEP destroying them until you repent to the most high” 

A murmur went across the pitch up tent, “You have raised your hands against your brothers, and there have been weeping and gnashing of this lawless land, REPENT, repent I say and all will be fine and dandy again” - more murmurs start to rumble across the tent, “How will we know when God has forgiven our souls?” said a farmer from the back,  “When God has told me that each and every one of you has repented, God will forgive you and will stop this hell that is happening!” - said the preacher. 

The preacher walked off the stage and sat down, rubbing the sweat off of his forehead. People started to exit the tent, but a young farmer came to the preacher and knelt down - “Preacher?” he said “ See, I’m real, real worried. My Pa and Ma have been fighting each other, real bad, They show up with busted stuff of all kinds. I need you preacher, I need you to come help safe ourselves from the wrath of God”

“I shall see what I can do child” the preacher said

“Is tonight good?” said the young farmer
“Tonight shall be fine”

“Thank you sir, thank you, I promise not to waste your time” and with that, the young farmer walked away, determined to save his and his parents' souls, and to have this terrible dust storm end. 

It was a calm night when the preacher finally made it to the young farmers’ residence. The house looked like it got hit from every dust bowl that has ever happened in america. The windows were shattered, and glass littered the floor. The preacher walked up the stairway, careful not to step on the glass as he did. 

As he made it to the door, the preacher could not help but notice all the shouting that was happening on the other side of the door. The preacher knocked on the door three times, and heard someone running and unlocked the door before opening it.

“Ah, Preacher Wilson! It must have been a miracle from God that you are at my front door right now” said the young farmer, “Please, please come in” 

As the preacher entered the house, a smell of fresh blood rushed at him. Every wall inside the house had dents in them. Blood splatters lined the walls as well. THere was shouting and yelling coming from one of the rooms.

“Preacher, please, make yourself at home while I get my Ma and Pa”

The preacher sat in one of the chairs as waited. He heard scuffled feet and turned to look at who it was. 

It was the farmers’ parents.

Each one of them had bruises, scarpes, and cuts. The Father had an ear and an eye missing, while the Mother had most of her hair pulled out. 

“Ma, Pa, this is the fine preacher I have been talking about” said the young farmer, “He’s going to help you both get better” The young farmer got stools and motioned for them to sit. 

“I take it that you two do not enjoy each other’s company?” said the preacher. There was no action from either of the parents, “ I reckon you know what is going on around here?” there was still no motion 

“Horrible, horrible times, and it has led me to read my Holy Bible 5, 6, maybe 7 times in the past two days. God has punished us, here in this state, and I could not find out the reason why. We are god fearing people, you know that, most of us read the Bible and listen to what God has to say” said the preacher, “I reckon that at a time, you two read your Bibles and listen to what our Lord had to say, but not anymore. God has forgiven you, but destroying each others’ temples, destroying the wonderful gift that God has given you, is a evil, evil sin, that shall not go unpunished.”


“Wha-what do you mean?” said the Father

“I mean, I think I found my root cause, my gold. All this time, I have been reading the bible, wondering why God is punishing us. But I have forgotten that even though there are god fearing people, there will always be snakes.” said the preacher, “There will always be thorns, always be people who just CANNOT follow the rules, even if God, a loving and merciful God, has forgiven them time after time, and given them chance after chance to stop making mistakes, they refuse to follow the rules. God hates people that do not follow the rules, and so he punishes them, but of course their punishment does not only affect them, it affects everyone.”

The preacher glared the two parents, “And some people's punishments last too long, they have to be put down. May God give you resistance, and may he punish you accordingly.”

April 16, 1931:

Two huge wooden statues shadows engulfed the whole town. Each one had a cage in them, and each one had the father and the mother of the young farmer in them. Bundles of the wood lay at the base of the statues. The towns people surrounded the statues, with the Preacher in the middle. 

“We come here, dear people, to repay the sins of hateful for the most high. These two sinners are the reason why people have died, these two sinners are the reason why a dust storm has engulfed this grand state, these two sinners are the reason all of your crops have failed to yield food and money. These two people, these evil, vile demons are the reason why God has released hell onto us, and they must repay, we must make God happy again.”

The preacher gave a nod to a man in a black robe, who lit the bundles of wood on fire. 

“THEY SHALL REPAY, THESE DEMONS SHALL BE DRAGGED TO HELL, THEY KNEW THE RESULTS IF THEY DID NOT, WOULD NOT TURN TO OUR GOD, AND NOW THEY SHALL DIE.”

The statues erupted in flames, and the townspeople started to form a circle around the statues, singing amazing grace. The screams from the cages erupted. The father and mother gasped for air, trying to grab for anything that will get them away from the flames that now kicked them.

By 1940, all of the signs of the dust bowl were gone. Kansas recovered, and farmers started to get food from their crops again. The preacher had gone after the burning, and he was never seen again. Some people say he’s still alive,  and lives in the under bridge of some highway, but no one can deny, he may or may not contributed to helping Kansas from disaster
