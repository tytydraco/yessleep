Hi Reddit, I don’t usually make this kind of post but I’ve been having some problems at work. Just for some background, I work the night shift alone at a 24hr car dealership. I don't know why we’re open 24/7, I think its some kind of gimmick. We’ve cycled through 6 managers in the last 2 years and I don't think any of them have had enough time to actually rethink the idea. Anyway, when the promotion started they offered an extra 5 dollars an hour to whoever took on the night shift, so I jumped at the chance. Since then, its pretty much been a perfect 2 years for me, there are basically no customers, and those that do come are usually only there because they need to be so the close rate is great. I also get a tonne of free time, I’ve actually become fluent in French since I started the night shift due to all the extra time. I’ve only had a couple run ins with weird customers which have only been a problem because the company is too cheap to actually hire security (although they usually get temporary security after the incidents). I realize that a lot of that information seems unnecessary, and it might be, but I think it should help to illustrate the problem that I’m having. 


So for the past 2 months I have been having a regular customer, which as you can expect is pretty strange for a car lot (when I say regular customer, I really just mean regular browser). This guy comes in, walks around the lot, looking at cars, kicking tires, coming in for coffee and cookies, etc. The first few times he showed up he didn't come inside, just walked around the car lot looking around. After the 3rd or 4th time he came around I decided that he might be waiting for someone to help him so I braved the night and went to talk to him, the conversation went like most conversations with customers, all very standard. I walked around the lot with him for a while while he told me about all the different cars he was interested in. We walked around for about 2 hours that night (you do get pretty bored when you work alone every day) but I didn't make a sale. He came back, not the next day, but a few times over the next week, each time I would go out, walk around the lot with him, just talking about whatever came up, his family, his job, his insomnia, etc. The whole thing became very routine, at that point I really didn’t expect to make a sale, it was just something to do to pass the time.


This all sounds pretty good I imagine (or my standards are low from working nights for the last 2 years), but about 2 weeks ago things started to get uncomfortable. During one of our walks the topic shifted to politics, something which surprisingly had never come up over our month of conversation. Normally this guy is very calm, he has a polite presence, and has never made me feel uncomfortable, but as soon as the topic shifted, I could tell he was getting angry. I didn't say much, and I tried to reroute the conversation as much as I could, but he just kept getting angrier and angrier, until he was yelling at me in the parking lot, face red, covered with sweat and spit coming from his mouth. Until recently this is the most scared I have ever been in my life. I basically ran inside the building and locked the door behind me, he looked sort of shocked and just stood there outside before shuffling away, I think he might have been embarrassed.


The next few days he didn't show up, but my stomach was in knots the entire time. The idea that someone who honestly I considered a friend could become dangerous so quickly really scared me. Before anyone says, I have considered asking to switch to the day shift, but the idea of actually putting a focus on the night shift (and making my extra $5 an hour go away) is kind of not something I want even if I’m scared. I know that they have offered security in the past but that was 3 managers ago, and I just don't want to risk it. When he did finally show up, he brought a large goodie basket with him, full of different things that we talked about over the month that he's been coming by, snacks, drinks, even a video game that I had talked about wanting. I tried to tell him that it was okay and he didn't need to worry about it, but he got kind of forceful, not like before, its hard to describe but his tone was nice but still kind of scary (at the time I just assumed it was because of the previous experience that I was reading into it). I accepted the gift, and I was ready to come up with some excuse to get him to leave, but he told me that he knew it was better for him to leave, and he apologized for blowing up at me. 


The apology basically boiled down to “Sorry I’m going through a divorce and my kids have been having similar conversations with me and I just blew up.” Both of these issues had not come up in our previous conversations.
I didn't see him again for another couple days until last week when he started coming around again. When he came back, he acted like everything was normal, to the point of being even more friendly than he was before. Instead of walking around the lot, he now comes into the showroom, usually bringing small gift, at the start of the week I tried again to say it wasn't necessary but like before I got a very forceful order to keep it, and I could see him heating up again.


 I now realize I didn't describe him much at the start, but he is a white man, mid 50s, well put together with slicked back grey and black thinning hair and a matching black and grey moustache. He usually wore warm sweaters when I first met him, but since the weather has changed he has worn a nice looking leather jacket. All of this is to say that he is normally very put together. However, over the past week and a half he has deteriorated, physically. I don't think he has showered, all of his clothes are covered in sweat stains, and I think he may be sleeping in them. 


His visits are much shorter than they were in the past, and his behaviour is very erratic, on Wednesday he was friendly, it felt almost like he was back to his old self, he joked around, and I was starting to feel like he was just hitting a rough patch, but the very next day he was angry, stomping around the show room, yelling about his wife and kids, how ungrateful they were. The really scary part was when he got calm and told me that I was never ungrateful.
All of these times I have considered speaking to my manager, telling her that I need security, but I haven’t gone through with it. If he stayed longer I might, but its 15-20 minutes out of my night, and it just hasn’t seemed worth it to me. I feel really stupid now but I don't know that was my thought process.
As I’m writing this the police left about an hour ago, I’m not at the dealership anymore, I don’t want to say where I am, but I don't think he can find me. The police gave me an escort just in case, so I think I’m alright. Okay, I’m really not looking forward to writing this next part.


When he came in today he practically ran to my desk, sweaty, hair all over his face, and his lips pulled back in something like a smile, like he just couldn’t wait to see me. I just cant get the sight out of my head. He clumsily lunged onto the counter and started flailing to grab me. He caught my arm and started mumbling about how I need to come with him, how he did everything for me. I had been crying this entire time (I still am honestly) so I couldn’t see super well but I managed to scratch at his face which I think shocked him. He stumbled backwards and cracked his head on the ground, he wasn't unconscious and I could hear him mumbling. Im sorry I don't know what he was saying.


I ran into the managers office and shut and locked the door behind me. My phone was on my desk when he came into the showroom, and the office phased out desk phones in favour of personal devices (with the exception of the showroom desk), so I had no way of calling the police at this point. Outside the office door I heard his footsteps and a massive crash as he repeatedly slammed into the door. I yelled at him through the door that I called the police on the office phone, the slamming halted and he started pleading with me to let him in. I stayed silent and after a minute I heard him walk away from the door. I waited in the room for an hour before leaving to call the police for real on the front desk phone (my smartphone was gone and has not been found).


The police arrived shortly after. They informed me that the man had committed familial homicide before coming to find me. He has not yet been apprehended.


Sorry I got a bit off track with all that, is a 5 dollar pay bump normal for night shifts?
