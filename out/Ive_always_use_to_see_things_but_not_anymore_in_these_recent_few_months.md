since I was young I've always had trouble sleeping wherever it's falling or staying asleep and I would occasionally have some freaky ass dreams but I don't know wherever or not it was in my head or just paranoia, i genuinely saw things time to time.

when I was around 5 I was still sleeping with my parents and one time I woke up middle of the night screaming bloody murder because I thought there was a spider above me on the wall where the bed was, my parents said there was nothing there.

and around that age I didn't like sleeping alone because of these occurrences where id wake up and see things, I was especially afraid of someone breaking into my room for some reason or something getting me.

in the same house, one night I woke up turned to the window which was next to my bed and saw a pair of red eyes staring right back at me I immediately ran to my parents room but while I was running up the stairs I saw its gaze following me through the window, when I told my parents they of course didn't believe me said it was our cat but that didn't feel like a cat especially because of the red glowing eyes in the darkness.

i was in my living room, it was night and I looked out of our sliding doors window and saw a face looking back at me in the distance, don't know what that was about.

now the most vivid thing I've ever seen was when I was 10 or 11.
I was sharing a room with my older sister, the bed was in the middle of the room against the wall next to the door which was wide open, I think I was turning around or just opened my eyes but when I did I saw a creepy ass creature in the middle of the hallway staring at my parents room door. It was tall I think I only saw part of its face but it had wide crazy eyes and a creepy sharp smile from what I remember, I just turned around and faced away from it falling back asleep but that still haunts me to this day. I don't think I told anyone but that felt real I don't think I was imagining that but at the same time... what could that have been...?

fast forward I was 13, it was around 2 in the morning, my bed was in the middle of the room for some reason and accros my bed on the wall there was a mirror which was directly facing the bed but one night I woke up and a saw a dark figure with a hat looking at me and that really freaked me out and a few nights later i wake up completely startled because I heard a noise in my room a very loud one but nothing fell or anything and it was right next to my bed, now that year this would happen a few times where I would see figures and would have oddly vivid dreams of things (like of me dying or being harmed)

that's all I can think of now but I have to say I get very paranoid sometimes and I still do, example the other day I thought I saw a face looking at me in the reflection of my bathroom mirror, or just things in the corner of my eye and the feeling of being watched.

what is happening?
