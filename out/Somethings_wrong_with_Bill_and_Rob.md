 Something's wrong with my friends Bill and Rob. They're cousins, or maybe brothers-in-law; I'm not totally sure. They don't seem like either though; they seem more like old buddies who've known each other since they were kids.

   Lately though, Bill and Rob haven't been acting right. It's not as if they're not themselves. Bill is still sweet, kind, quiet Bill, and Rob is still funny, excitable, smiley Rob. Bill is just quieter and more tired, and Rob is a bit louder and more excitable. I'm just worried because every time I see them they're like this. They also seem to get more easily annoyed with each other.

 Today I saw Bill and Rob in a shouting match. They've never done that before. Usually their arguments and disagreements are kept quiet and just talked about, but today they were screaming at each other. I don't have second hand embarrassment from everyone staring at them, far from it actually. I'm far more scared because I thought I heard Bill whisper to Rob (after their fight) that he was going to skin him and wear him as a coat.

 I'm really excited! I have a race soon on the 18th and 19th. I get Friday off of school too to travel up to Priest Lake. I like getting days off of school. I hope Bill and Rob figured out whatever was going on with them. It's kind of scary, them yelling at each other. I think I misheard what Bill said though, he's really not like that. It just wouldn't make sense.

 Bill and Rob are both here; it seems like they're doing better too, mostly at least. I think Bill had another spat with his wife. That happens sometimes. It worries me, though, that Rob seems to be a bit out of sorts. He's less excited than usual; more sad even. Blue isn't his color, but red is! He was wearing his signature San Francisco's 49er's hat. I think I might ask him what's going on tomorrow.

 So I asked, because of course I did. He would only say he's going through a bit of a rough time. I asked if he and Bill were doing okay. He just looked at me and shrugged. Maybe they're not doing so good after all. I don't know what I should do. Anyway, I asked if they were gonna go to the Sumpter race in a couple weeks. Bill said sure, and Rob smiled and said maybe. I hope they show up.

 Bill's here, but Rob's not. He said Rob couldn't get the time off of work. That's okay though cause Bill's here! He seemed excited to be at this race. I sure hope his sleds don't break, they have a tendency to do that.

 Today is race day! I'm here with my 78’ Yamaha Exciter 340, and I am so ready to win.

 Okay, so it's the end of the day now, I did the math, and I went around that track 51 times. Six races. Three laps in heats, five in mains. Oh, and an LCQ. That's double my usual amount of laps. Bill was really tired this morning; he almost didn't go to tech check, which was weird, but I guess he's more old and tired without Rob to keep him jumping around? Maybe that's why he's been getting so mad at Rob; he just doesn't want to run around that much. I'm not sure. I talked to him and he said he'd see me next year so that's cool! I told him to say hi to Rob for me, and he said he would. So maybe they're doing better? I hope so.

 Bill's here. Rob's not. Bill's coat looks weird today. It's thin and a weird grayish-tan color. It's also got a very gray, fluffy hood. It's kind of a weird hood. It looks like Rob's hair when he puts it on. Bill's still old and tired, but now he's got this weird look in his eyes. I can't pinpoint what it is.

 He just came up to me. I feel disgusted. He put the hood and Rob’s 49er's hat on his head and said hi. He was still Bill, but it felt like he was pretending to be Rob. 

 Oh God. I just looked at the sleeves. They have the fingerless hand things on the end. They look like real hands. I don't think I misheard him last year. I think his whispered threat wasn't a threat at all: It was a promise. I think he skinned Rob and made him into a coat.
