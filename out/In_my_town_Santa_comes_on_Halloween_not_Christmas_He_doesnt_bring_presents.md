I live in a strange town. Over here, traditions don't work normally. We don't go trick or treating on Halloween. Neither do we get presents on Christmas. We do have a Santa though, a real one. He comes on Halloween. You do not want to meet him.

I moved to this town - my mother's hometown, six months ago. After the divorce, I needed help with Astrid, and Mom offered us her guest house. She said it would be good for us. A fresh start.

The town is small. Nordic. The kind of place where everyone knows everyone and the forests press in close on all sides.

Mom taught me the rules within the first week.

*Never enter the woods behind the eastern properties.*

*Never go to the peak of any mountain after noon.*

*Never whistle after dark in November.*

*Never leave your shoes pointing toward the door on October nights.*

*Never question why.*

I laughed the first time she listed them. She didn't laugh back.

"These aren't suggestions," she said. "People die when they don't follow the rules."

The most important rule, the one she made me memorize: Do not end up on the Naughty List.

I thought she was joking. Some local superstition to scare kids. 

Then she showed me the church records. Names posted every November 1st. One per year, going back generations. I recognized some of the surnames, their families still in town.

"What happened to them?" I asked.

"They didn't follow the rules," she said, and wouldn't say more.

Then something happened in August.

Mom offered to watch Astrid while I drove to the city for a job interview. Astrid was six, well-behaved, and my mother insisted.

She called me three hours later, sobbing.

"I lost her. She ran into the woods and I couldn't catch her. My knees—"

I was still forty minutes away. I told her to call someone, anyone. She said no one would go into the eastern woods. Not for any reason.

I broke every speed limit getting back. I went straight into the trees, screaming Astrid's name until my throat bled.

I found her an hour later, sitting by the old stone markers deep in the forest. The ones covered in symbols that aren't quite crosses.

She was humming. Playing with pinecones. Completely fine.

"Astrid!" I grabbed her. "You know better than to run off!"

"But Grandma said there were berries here. She said I should go pick them for dinner."

I looked back at the tree line. My mother was standing there, watching us. Her face was pale but she wasn't crying anymore.

"I'm so sorry," she said when we came out. "I couldn't stop her."

I was too angry to think clearly. Too relieved. I took Astrid home and didn't speak to my mother for a week.

I didn't tell anyone what happened.

Three weeks ago, I received a letter.

Cream-colored paper, no postage. My surname written in handwriting that looked ancient and mechanical. Inside, one line:

**You have been counted.**

I showed it to my mother. Her hands started shaking.

"Who else knows about this?"

"No one. What does it mean?"

She wouldn't look at me. "It means you need to prepare."

"For what?"

She left without answering.

The town changed after that. Neighbors crossed to the other street when they saw me. The grocer wouldn't touch my money. When I asked why, she just shook her head and turned away.

Astrid asked why no one talked to us anymore.

I didn't have an answer.

Four days ago, the church bells started ringing at the wrong hours. Seven bells at dawn. Seven at dusk.

Yesterday, I found symbols carved into my front door. The same symbols from the stones. When I tried to sand them away, my hands bled.

Last night, Astrid said she heard sleigh bells outside her window.

It's October 30th now.

This morning I tried to leave town. Packed the car, drove. Twenty minutes later I was passing the same tree over and over. The town wouldn't let me leave. 

I had to turn back.

I went to Pastor Iversen. He was cleaning the church steps.

"Please," I said. "Tell me what's happening. Tell me what the letter means."

He looked at me for a long moment. "Your daughter crossed the stones?"

"Yes, but—"

"Then she's been marked. Tomorrow night, Santa comes for the marked."

"How do I stop it?"

"You don't." He started to go inside.

"Wait! The Naughty List, when does it go up?"

"November 1st. Outside the church door. After he's already collected." He paused. "It's not a warning. It's a record."

The door closed.

I drove to my mother's house. She was sitting at her kitchen table, hands folded, waiting.

"You knew," I said. "You sent her into those woods on purpose."

She didn't deny it.

"Someone has to cross the stones every year," she said. "It's how the contract works. One marked child, or he takes whoever he wants. Entire families at times"

"You used your own granddaughter—"

"I did what everyone here does. That's how we survive. You were new. You didn't understand. That made it easier."

"Made WHAT easier?"

She looked at me like I was stupid. "Choosing who to send."

I left. Came home shaking. Found old records in my attic - newspapers, obituaries, church documents going back decades.

Every name on the List had been seen near the stones in the months before Halloween. Every single one had parents who were new to town. Outsiders. People who didn't understand the game.

The stones don't mark children by accident. They mark the ones who are sent there.

It's almost sundown now.

I can hear the bells.

I'm not locking the doors. I'm not hiding.

I'm going to face him.

\-------

The bells are coming from the woods.

I see him moving between the trees. Tall. Wrong. His limbs are too long, joints bending at angles that make my eyes hurt. The red he wears moves like something alive, pulsing. It has not been dyed red, I can tell blood has colored it crimson. His face is smooth and white as porcelain, no features except two black holes where eyes should be. They aren't simply empty, but hollow, like tunnels going back and back forever into nothing.

I step outside. "You can't have her!"

He stops. Tilts his head. That hollow gaze finds me.

He takes a step forward.

I run back inside. Grab Astrid from her room.

"Mommy, what's wrong?"

The front door explodes inward. His footsteps make the house rattle.

I run out the back with Astrid in my arms. Into the woods. I don't care about the rules anymore.

Behind us, footsteps. Slow. Patient. The bells never stop ringing.

I run until my lungs are screaming. Until Astrid is sobbing. Until—

I stop.

We're at the stones.

I've been running in circles. The woods led me back.

The footsteps stop behind me.

I turn.

He's standing there. Three meters tall. The red pulses. His smooth face doesn't need light for it to be seen. He glows from within. His mouth doesn't move when he speaks.

"The marked one." His voice is wind through dead trees.

"Please," I whisper. "Take me instead."

Those hollow eyes bore into me. "You were not marked."

"Then mark me now!"

"It does not work that way."

He reaches for Astrid.

I pull her behind me. "I won't let you!"

He stops. Tilts his head again, like I've confused him.

"You misunderstand," he says.

He gestures behind me.

I turn.

My mother is standing at the stones. I didn't hear her approach. She's holding something: a knife.

"Mom?"

She doesn't look at me. She's looking at Astrid.

"I'm sorry," my mother says. "But it's time."

"Time for what?"

Santa speaks. "The contract requires a sacrifice. One child, one name, marked at the stones, delivered by blood."

I stare at my mother. At the knife.

"No," I breathe. "No, you can't—"

"I can," my mother says. "I have to. That's the contract. The stones mark them. The family delivers them."

"You're her GRANDMOTHER—"

"And this is how we survive." She takes a step toward Astrid. "Every year, someone has to do this. Better me than someone who'd make her suffer."

Santa is watching. Waiting.

I grab Astrid and run, but there's nowhere to go. The woods are a cage. Every direction leads back to the stones.

My mother follows slowly. She doesn't need to rush.

"Why are you doing this?" I scream.

"Because it's my turn," she says. "The grandmothers always do it. We mark the children, we send them to the stones, and we deliver them when he comes. That's the system."

"What happens if you don't?"

She stops. Looks at me with something cold in her eyes.

"Then I go instead."

I understand now. The letter was for her, not me. **"You have been counted"** meant she'd been selected to perform the delivery. And if she doesn't give Santa what he came for, he takes her.

This isn't about tradition or survival.

It's about cowardice.

"I won't let you touch her," I say.

My mother's face hardens. "Then I'll go through you first."

She lunges.

I shove Astrid behind me. My mother's knife slashes my arm. I grab her wrist. We struggle.

Behind us, Santa watches. Silent. Patient.

"Please," I beg. "She's your granddaughter—"

"She's a NAME!" my mother screams. "She's a name on a list and I will NOT die for her!"

She's stronger than she looks. She wrenches free. Raises the knife —

I tackle her.

We hit the ground hard. The knife skitters away.

I see it then, in my mother's eyes. Not love. Not even hatred.

Just fear.

Desperate, animal fear.

She claws at my face. "He'll take me if I don't give her to him—"

"Then let him take you!"

My hands find the knife.

My mother's eyes go wide.

"Wait—"

I drive it into her chest.

She gasps. Blood spreads across her shirt, dark, almost black in the fading light.

Santa steps forward.

"A sacrifice has been made," he says.

He reaches down. Not toward Astrid.

Toward my mother.

She tries to crawl away. "No—no, it was supposed to be the girl—the marked one—"

"The marked one," Santa says, "is the one brought to the stones in blood."

He lifts my mother effortlessly. She screams.

"The contract does not specify which blood. All I need is a name and blood." he says.

He turns toward the forest. My mother is thrashing, screaming my name, begging me to help her.

I hold Astrid close and watch them disappear into the trees.

The bells fade.

The forest is quiet.

On the ground, where my mother fell, I see something. A piece of paper, fallen from her pocket.

I pick it up.

It's a name, written in rust-colored ink.

*Astrid J.*

My mother wrote it. She was going to place it at the stones before she killed my daughter. That's how the system works. The grandmothers write the names. They mark the children. They deliver them.

But I stopped her.

I saved Astrid.

We walk home through the dark forest. Astrid is quiet, in shock. I'll need to explain this someday. I'll need to tell her what her grandmother tried to do.

Tomorrow, the church will post a name on November 1st.

It won't be Astrid's.

We're safe now.

I unlocked the door. We go inside.

Astrid goes to her room. I collapse on the couch, shaking with adrenaline and relief.

It's over.

We survived.

I close my eyes.

When I open them, it's morning.

November 1st.

I walk to the church. A small crowd has gathered at the steps.

The List is posted.

One name, written in rust-colored ink:

*Astrid J.*

No.

I stare at it. My vision blurs.

I stopped her. I killed my mother. I saved—

Then it hits me.

The paper in my mother's pocket. The name she'd written.

*"Astrid J."*

The contract requires a name written in blood AND a delivery at the stones.

My mother wrote the name.

I delivered a body to the stones.

But I never wrote my mother's name.

Santa's last words ring in my ears, "All I need is a name and blood."

The sacrifice that counts is the one whose name is written.

I scream and run back home. Through the door.

"Astrid!"

Silence.

Her room is empty. Her dolls are on the floor. The window is open.

"ASTRID!"

I tear through the house. Check every room. Every closet. Under every bed.

She's gone.

I run outside. Into the woods. Straight to the stones.

"ASTRID! BABY, WHERE ARE YOU?"

The clearing is empty.

Just the stones. The symbols. The silence.

I fall to my knees.

"Please," I whisper. "Please bring her back."

Nothing.

I sob. Claw at the ground. Scream until my throat tears.

Then I see it.

At the base of the largest stone, there's something that wasn't there before.

A box. Wrapped in red paper. Tied with white ribbon. A *present*

Santa has never given anyone a present.

My hands shake as I pick it up.

It's light. Almost empty.

I tear off the wrapping.

Inside is a piece of paper.

I stare at it. Mind numb. Eyes watering.

I flip the paper. Behind it, a note.

"On Christmas, we shall exchange presents. Or I keep mine"

In the distance, I can hear bells ringing. The wind blows through these cursed woods. It sounds like three words.

*Ho ho ho*
