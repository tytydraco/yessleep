Like any great lie, it looked like a miracle.

Without a word, Dad stood up from his favorite recliner, shuffled across the carpet, down the front hallway, twisted the brass knob, and set out into the dreary overcast. The screen door slammed shut behind him, punctuating his departure like a rattling exclamation point.

My father hadn’t done a single thing of own volition for three years.

Not to say that his body was incapable, though.

His muscles worked fine. The physical therapists I hired kept them strong. Most of his organs worked just fine, too. His heart pumped an adequate amount of blood. His stomach churned functional acid. The machinery was intact, but the part of his brain that controlled voluntary impulses had been damaged. He needed guidance and direction to perform any task.

The stroke stole a lot of him, but agency was its cruelest prize.

Through the foyer’s bay windows, my eyes followed his lumbering movements across the yard. A dreamy mixture of bewilderment, hope, and vindication trickled down my spine. Warm honey smeared across ailing nerves, sticky and sweet.

The doctors, the social workers, my brother: they’d eat their words.

I *knew* he’d get better.

Then, I watched him disappear from view, newly obscured behind a collected heap of fallen leaves.

My heart fell through my chest.

I shot up and bolted towards the yard. As my feet echoed against the hardwood, a medley of familiar admonishments paraded around my skull.

*Pay attention, idiot.*

*It’ll be your fault if he’s hurt out there.*

*Who’s really got the brain damage, him or you?*

Thoughts of him bleeding in the street kept my pace fast and frantic. I flung the door open. The knob thudded against a nearby wall, leaving a circular indent in the plaster.

But there he was.

Motionless on the stoop, nose pressed gently into the mesh of the screen door, soft blue eyes vacantly fixed forward. Icy whispers of approaching winter curled over his frame. The breeze made me shiver.

I ushered my father inside and locked the deadbolt behind him. To my relief, he looked OK: no cuts on his arms, no bruises on his scalp, no visible injuries at all.

*“W-What’d you see out there, Dad?”* I asked, stammering. The question felt strange and delicate rolling over my tongue, like an embarrassing attempt at a foreign language.

He didn’t respond.

In the years since his stroke, I talked to Dad plenty - he was the only other person in the house after all - but the conversation was effectively rhetorical.

He’d never respond.

Because of that, I shied away from directly asking him anything. Too painful.

Instead, I stuck to saying things that didn't demand a response, like *“remember how much Mom loved the smell of lavender*” or *“I can’t believe how shitty the Cardinals are playing this year.”* Statements that acted as some peculiar median point between talking to myself and prayer.

Dad pushed past me with surprising force and returned to his recliner. That’s when I noticed he was thumbing something in his pants pocket, rhythmically dragging the digit across whatever he discovered on the lawn. 

Once he settled, I bent over him and lightly extricated his hand from the pocket, revealing a trembling wrist with knuckles tightly clasped around a small object. I pried his fingers open, wholly unsure of what I was about to find. 

It was just a leaf.

A singular, unbroken leaf with six slender tips and an odd complexion: bright gold with specks of jet-black that seemed to drift under its surface continuously, like living film grain. The more I stared, the more the pattern seemed to change, specks ebbing and flowing through a sea of shimmering gold.

Entranced, I moved my fingertips to touch it.

His hand snapped closed around the leaf and shot back into his pocket.

His other hand grabbed my shirt collar and violently pulled my head down.

I felt wet heat as he put cracked lips against my ear and rasped. A deep, steady scrape of his vocal cords, barely audible, though, like the wind dragging the tip of a tree branch against a rusty gutter while you’re trying to fall asleep, it sounded like an omen.

One by one, I calmly peeled his skeletal fingers from my collar. His hands fell to his sides lifelessly. 

He resumed his usual afternoon activity - silently staring out the window - and I retreated to the safety of my own recliner.

From across the foyer, I could tell he was still making the noise, even if I couldn’t hear it. His Adam’s Apple never stopped quivering.

Crazy as it may seem, I grinned.

I’d convinced myself that, for the first time since his stroke, he was trying to speak.

\- - - - -

I didn’t give Milo the good news immediately.

My brother, the self-labeled *“realist”,* would require persuasion. He’d need something more meaningful than a few aberrant movements and some quiet rasping to accept he'd been wrong, and that Dad was getting better.

So I watched, and I waited, confident that he’d be his old self again in no time.

Miraculously, Dad didn’t need prompting anymore.

He’d eat of his own accord. He cleaned himself when necessary. He knew when to sleep and woke up at the same time every day.

But he still wasn’t speaking, and he never let go of that leaf.

Then, about a week after his impromptu resurrection, he locked himself in my second-floor guest bedroom.

A wrinkle in his upward trajectory, sure, but I reasoned that once I knew *why*, it'd all click back into place. 

From outside, I couldn’t hear the gentle hum of the TV, or the faint rustling of pages being turned. I thought the space was silent, but then I pressed my ear to the door.

There *was* a sound.

It wasn’t the rasping of his vocal cords. It was a soft, persistent crinkle. Sounded like he was folding a sheet of cheap gift wrap into smaller and smaller squares.

Hesitantly, I knocked.

*“Mind if come in, Dad?”*

No response.

Once again, I pressed my ear against the door.

The crinkling had stopped.

\- - - - -

With night looming, I considered calling an ambulance. Dad had been locked in that room for eight hours. 

Surely, he needed to eat, I reminded him. Drink some water. Relieve himself.

No matter what I said, though, he wouldn’t come out.

My finger hovered over the *call* button, but I paused.

Did I really want to involve them - the police, the paramedics, maybe even the fire department?

Would they understand? 

Or would they be like Milo, and only see Dad as something waiting to be discarded? 

A horse with a broken leg?

I clicked the screen off and slid my cellphone back into my pocket.

It wasn’t worth the risk.

The medical system had already tried to kill him once, and I wasn’t willing to give them a second shot.

I looked down the hallway, estimating how much of a running start the layout would afford me. Twenty-five feet, give or take. Seemed like enough.

I walked to the end of the corridor, aimed my shoulder at the locked door, and began sprinting.

Seconds away from collision, there was a *click*. The door creaked ajar. Thick darkness like brackish water leaked through the slit.

I skidded, sneakers squeaking, knees throbbing from the sudden shifts in momentum. My bicep kissed the old oak as I came to a stop, and the door creaked wide open. Humid air slithered over my skin, and the smell of it made me gag. The scent was revoltingly sweet.

With a hummingbird heart, I peered into the darkness. 

Two small golden rings glistened in the lightless deluge. A pair of wedding bands resting at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench.

It was his eyes.

Motionless, unblinking, and fixed squarely on me from the back of the room.  

My trembling fingers crawled along the wall, searching for the light switch.

Dad’s golden eyes pivoted noiselessly in the darkness. Side to side and back again.

He was shaking his head *no*.

In a sensation akin to déjà vu - a brisk, powerful head rush - I sort of understood.

He wasn’t ready to be seen.

Not yet.

I stepped back, grasped the knob, and pulled the door shut.

The crinkling resumed at a higher volume. 

Before long, something appeared at my feet, gliding under the frame and landing weightlessly on my sneaker.

A leaf.

It was like the one Dad brought in from outside, but much thinner, almost translucent, and its specks didn’t drift; they were locked into place.

Then, after a few seconds of crinkling, there was another.

And another,

and another.

\- - - - -

The leaves would fall only at night, and they wouldn’t remain leaves for long.

During the day, they’d melt.

From dawn until about noontime, the speckled gold would liquefy into a puddle of bubbling, molten amber. Then, the bubbling would calm and the amber would organize, hardening into a flurry of thin, gleaming tendrils over the course of the afternoon.

Each day, the leaves would fall *a little* farther, so when they melted down, the tendrils would become *a little* longer.

That’s how he grew.

I wondered what would happen when his roots reached the edge of the bannister, curious how he’d spread vertically.

The answer was simple:

His leaves were sticky.

They’d hang in the space between my first and second floors overnight, and crystallize come morning.

You’d think all of this would’ve been frightening, but I didn’t feel fear.

No, I felt serene, though I recognize the absurdity of that feeling in retrospect. 

You have to understand: I swore I’d never give up on him, and now, Dad was alive *and* self-sufficient. My hard work, my time, my loneliness - it wasn’t all for nothing. 

Hell, I'd lost weight. I'd sleep soundly, yet I was still tired all the goddamn time. The stress was downright crippling. 

Still. 

It'd all been worth it. 

And the only person who threatened that serenity, my newfound bliss, 

was Milo.

\- - - - -

*“What do you mean ‘I can’t visit’ this month?”* he hissed.

My palms were slick with sweat. I felt the phone slipping through my hand.

*“Because…”* I replied, trailing off.

I stared at Dad’s roots. The cascade of golden tendrils had just begun to congeal onto the floor.

*“You can’t bar me from seeing our father just because* ***you*** *don’t want me to. Guardianship doesn’t mean you get to make the rules. Legally, it’s my right.”*

I bent over, inspecting the contact point between my father and the wood fifty-feet below him, only half-listening to Milo. A frothy, milk-colored puddle of ooze was starting to develop. I’d witnessed the same phenomenon in the hallway upstairs, but it was much more florid in comparison - *that* ooze was thicker, with swirls of light pink and a scent like fermenting beer.

*“Listen - I’m not saying you* ***can’t*** *come, I’m saying you* ***shouldn’t*** *come.”*

*“And why the hell is that?”*

Instinctively, I pulled a tissue from a nearby end-table and dabbed at the slime.

The roots spasmed. A few lurched towards me, and a myriad of slim, golden threads exploded perpendicularly from those roots, lashing the back of my hand. Stung like hellfire. A cluster of tiny crimson pinpoints appeared at the base of my thumb, dripping blood.

The door to the guest bedroom shook on its hinges.

The foyer seemed to get much, much hotter, and it already felt like a greenhouse, despite it being November, despite the AC being off.

I yanked the tissue away and mouthed the word *“sorry”* at the roots.

*“Hello??”*

Milo’s tone was becoming sharper. I sighed, rolling my shoulders.

*“Dad doesn’t want you here, Milo.”*

*“What the fuck does that mean? We have no idea what he wants. That part of his brain suffocated a long time ago. Are you trying to tell me he’s sick?”*

*“Would you care if he was?”*

A pause.

*“That’s a real fucked-up thing to say, man.”*

There was a palpable melancholy hiding between each syllable. For a moment, I felt remorse.

But it was fleeting.

*“You know what I think is fucked-up? Campaigning to let your father wither away and die. A campaign that the judge said you lost, in case you forgot, because I have guardianship. For thirty-six months, I’ve been doing whatever it takes to keep him healthy. So, yes, Milo, I know what he wants. I’m more attuned to his wants than you’ll ever be, and he doesn’t want to see the son that tried so damn hard to put him six feet under the fucking dirt.”*

He started to say something:

*“We both know that Dad wouldn’t want to live like -”*

I hung up.

\- - - - -

Reluctantly, I called Milo back a few days later and apologized. Not because I actually felt guilty.

I just *really* didn’t want the police showing up unannounced for a wellness check.

He seemed to accept the explanation that Dad was *looking sicker,* and I didn’t want anything stressing him out.

Milo then asked if he could FaceTime with me and him.

I told him Dad was taking a nap and that later this week would be better, with no intention of following through.

And that was that.

\- - - - -

Every night before bed, I’d knock on his door.

I’d say things like:

*“Are you ready for me to see you yet?”*

or

*“Do you need anything? Water, or food, or…”*

and he’d never respond.

I didn’t let that fact get me down.

Mostly.

I knew he’d say something back.

Eventually. 

\- - - - -

At first, I thought his growth was arbitrary.

I figured he was expanding just for expansion’s sake, almost like a hobby.

But no, the more I watched, the more purposeful it seemed.

Once his roots reached the floor, the leaves didn’t float out from under the doorframe anymore. Instead, they were carried along the roots themselves by the same string-like appendages that would lash at me occasionally, like a conveyor belt.

This allowed them to change direction. 

Instead of crystalizing straight ahead - further into the foyer - they veered ninety degrees clockwise, carrying leaves to the rightmost corner of his golden tangle and dropping them there. Then, slowly, day by day, they grew towards the cellar. In anticipation, I cleared a path. Propped the door open with a stack of records.

That said, I think they would’ve curled under the frame perfectly fine if I hadn’t propped it open. 

But I was desperate to figure out how I could help. 

\- - - - -

I often wondered about the ooze. For a while, I theorized it was some sort of metabolic waste from Dad’s growth. Exhaust from his new, arboreal engine.

But if that was the case, why was he so protective of it?

It was puzzling.

After a while, fungus sprouted from the ooze. Not just one kind, either - all different flavors of mold. 

Light brown oyster mushrooms. 

Clusters of yellow-orange shelf fungi. 

Turkey Tail, Lion’s Mane, honey mushrooms - a veritable smorgasbord of wood-rot.

But that’s just it.

The surrounding wood *wasn’t* rotting. 

It looked strong and healthy. 

When I saw a cockroach stuck in the ooze, tethered to his roots by a few golden fibers, I began to develop a new theory. 

For days, it kept running in place. A masterclass in futility, spinning its jagged legs in place, on, and on, and on.

And yet, it never died. 

Even after I stepped on it. 

The cockroach snapped into three distinct pieces, each of which continued the original’s endless march. What’s more, when I returned to it a day later, I didn’t find three pieces.

I found a trio of fully formed, intact, identical-looking cockroaches.

The ooze? It was just overgrowth of the wood's natural bacteria. Around his roots, the germs were able to replicate boundlessly.

Same with the fungus, same with the insect.

Dad had become eternal, and he forced that gift onto everything he touched.

Something about watching those cockroaches broke me, though. 

Their wild, ceaseless motion against an unchangeable fate was agonizingly familiar.

For the first time, none of this seemed like a miracle.

And, to my unquantifiable horror,

I heard someone pounding on the front door.

\- - - - -

*“It’s Milo. I want to see that Dad’s OK with my own two eyes. Open the goddamn door or I’m calling the police.”*

I paced around the foyer, hand gripping my forehead, mind racing. 

Milo’s attempts grew more feverish. He began erratically chiming the doorbell between fits of knocking. I could tell the bedlam was stirring Dad; his roots were beginning to tremor. The temperature was rising. The sweetness in the air was becoming oppressively ripe.

I just needed him to leave.

With a deep breath, I walked forward, and opened the door a crack.

*“Milo -”* I started, talking in a sharp whisper, *“- please, you need to..”*

*“Jesus! There you are - you know how many times I’ve called you?”* he bellowed.

*“I know, I know, we can talk about this later, some other time - “*

Milo was barely listening. He was angling his head, craning his neck and standing on his tiptoes, trying to get a look inside while I tried to block his view with my body.

Suddenly, he leapt back, covering his nose, skull wobbling like he’d just been hit with a sucker punch.

*“Oh my God, what the* ***fuck*** *is that smell?”* he shouted.

Waves of water-logged heat rolled over my back. I could hear the sound of the guest bedroom door beginning to shake.

In a last-ditch effort, I begged.

*“Milo, please go, please, please just leave…”*

Backpedaling onto my lawn, he put both arms up, palms out - a gesture of surrender. I felt relief sweep through my soul as I lost sight of him in the moonless night.

*“Fine, man, but I’ll be coming back with the Police…”*

That was alright.

It bought me some time. 

I grabbed the knob and began pulling it closed.

There was a rush of movement behind me. 

A pointed, almost metallic-sounding *whoosh*, like fishing wire rapidly unwinding.

The force of it knocked me aside and threw the door open. 

My temple collided with the wall. My vision swam, dappled with bright lights, and stars,

and gold.

There was a hideous shriek of pain from outside, accompanied by a meaty *thud*. In the brief seconds of silence that followed, I struggled to right myself.

Once I’d almost gotten on two feet, the *whooshing* began anew.

Milo flew in through the door, his capture accented by breathless screams and the sickening snaps of fingernails breaking as Dad dragged him to the stairs.

I looked, but only for a moment.

His calves were adorned with hundreds of fibers, bright gold barbs progressively reddening as warm plasma leaked from his skewered muscles.

That wasn’t what caused me to close my eyes, though. 

It was absolute, mind-shattering terror stitched across his face. His gaping mouth. His bloodshot, bulging eyes. The tendons in his neck jumping from his skin.

I gathered myself into a ball, put my head in my hands, and waited for it to be over.

There was screaming.

Then a prolonged, fleshy squelch.

Then, nothing at all.

I couldn’t move.

I just laid there, in a ball, shaking, sweating, broken. 

At some point, my body-wide convulsions calmed, and I slept.

The following morning, depleted of adrenaline and drunk on apathy, I trudged up the stairs, unafraid.

The roots that curled under his door were painted a dusky crimson, with bits of skin and fragments of bone scattered around the small holes that were empty of vegetation.

Somehow, he dragged Milo's *entire body* through those tiny spaces without damaging the door. 

I’ve speculated that it must be reinforced, but I don’t know that for sure, because I still haven’t seen inside.

Now, I can’t hear the crinkling, even if I press my ear to the door.

Not that he isn’t still growing.

It’s more that the crinkling is inaudible over the sound of Milo talking.

Like the fractured cockroach, he’s been reborn.

And he’s spent the last week repeating the words he said before he died, on an endless loop, in a random order, with irregular inflections and volumes.

Screams and shouts, wails and whispers; on, and on, and on.

*“It’s Milo. I want to see that Dad’s OK with my own two eyes…”*

*“Open the goddamn door or I’m calling the police…”*

*“Jesus! There you are - you know how many times I’ve called you…”*

\- - - - -

I think I’m dying.

Probably had been dying before Dad even locked himself in that room, but I ignored the weight loss, and the fatigue, and the progressive yellowing of my now vibrantly jaundiced skin.

I’m not worried, though. 

There’s still hope for me.

Because something sprouted in my backyard yesterday.

A beautiful, bountiful tree, with leaves the color of the sun. Leaves that’ll remain radiant through the bitter chill of winter. Five feet of rich, vascular bark that wasn’t there twenty-four hours ago.

I traced the roots down the cellar stairs. The floor is unfinished: just cold, hard earth.

Dad implanted himself there.

He dug through the soil, blooming in my backyard overnight.

I walked outside this evening and stood under the tree. 

I basked in his warmth. 

I asked for guidance. 

I looked up to him and begged for instruction.

And, finally,

He responded.

As tears fell, he told me exactly what to do.

I got a ladder from the garage, placed it next to him, and entered the canopy.

I couldn’t pluck a leaf from one of his branches, but I could peel a copy of it away, crinkling as it separated. 

It felt tenderly warm and viciously alive in the palm of my hand.

Through a second-floor window, two golden eyes peered through the darkness, watching me as I returned inside. 

As soon as my foot landed on the hardwood, I heard a soft creaking upstairs.

The door’s finally open.

He’s ready to see me.

Lie or not, I have to believe it's still a miracle. 

And as I type this, I have a horrible, heavenly feeling,

That me, Dad, and even Milo,

are going to be together

for a very long
