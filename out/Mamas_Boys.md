I knew my mom had a career as an author before the three of us were born. She wrote fantasy, murder mysteries, and fantasy murder mysteries. She had her niche and rode that bull. Then the bull stopped dead. She'd never have that type of success or job fulfillment again. Not that it mattered, she'd had us shortly after, and thus she discovered a new meaning to life.



Or at least, that's what she always told us.



My brothers were due back for Christmas. One last holiday season together until they moved away to further their careers.



While I was cleaning, I found her books. On a whim, I started reading. 



They were good, and entertained me, though it didn’t take me long to read most of the books.  Each death I found odd, like a little itch at the back of my head telling me that it was weird. Even so, I bonded with several of the characters:



Jerome Rechsanwalt was a judge that was drowned after the town discovered who was really behind the murder of the old landowning widows. He had the best storyline; a ruthless death for a ruthless asshole.



Moses Schustuk, a rabbi who assembled an army to rise up against the Nazis, eventually becoming a martyr in an alternate World War II universe.



Michael Pelota, a teacher who coached football and got electrocuted to cover up an affair. Boring, but his death revealed the murderer. I solved that book the fastest.



Adrien Ford, a racing professional and adrenaline junkie who got too deep with the law, and now has to play cat-and-mouse with his captors.



Adam Greene was a student who was gunned down in a murder suicide, eventually the reader discovers that the murderer framed their spouse. The most sympathetic in my opinion, really felt for the guy. His death freaked me out the most.



Joseph Messi, a bipolar unreliable narrator who thought he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, torn apart by his followers in ritualistic suicide



I was interrupted from my reading to my brother's coming home. They brought so much stuff, I was forced to schlep a large part in, even with them "helping". As the days went on, the books were relegated to the back seat of my mind.



Christmas week had gone by with nothing out of the ordinary, and when I woke up the day before my brother's were to leave, I found the house oddly quiet.



I called out for my parents and brothers, the house remained silent. It wasn't until I got to the main upstairs bathroom where I found the first gruesome discovery.



My eldest brother Jerome, the lawyer, drowned in the bathtub. His mottled corpse in the shit-stained water told me he had been dead for hours. 



I stumbled backwards and bolted downstairs, shrieking for anyone to call the police. I only paused when I heard weird shuffling sounds from the garage. I opened the door slowly, dreading what I was to see on the other side.



It was my middle brother Michael, the university’s newest junior coach the next state over, zip tied to a chair; a car battery hooked up to his nipples. It guaranteed that the amps went straight across his heart, killing him. The battery still had juice in it, if his still twitching body had anything to say about it.



Suddenly, I realized why I had that weird feeling in the back of my head.



“Adam…”



The realization hit me like a truck: Mom had named us after characters in her books.



“I sent your father out on a long shopping trip, he won’t be back for a few hours…”



All the ones that died.



“When he comes back, he’ll join you…”



Jerome Moses, Michael Adrien, Adam Joseph....



“I have one last shot at reviving my career…”



I heard a series of bangs, and I was so numb with shock I didn’t even feel the bullets go through me until I collapsed.



"I'm sorry, Adam. I loved you…"
