This is a true story. Probably not thay scary but its caused me no sleep my whole life.

This was before moving to America with my uncle and one of the many creepy paranormal things that happened to me as a kid back in the early 2000's

I remember waking up and for some reason I had the urge to go to my moms garden to pray when I was 6 and then every day since then I woke up early to prey in my mom's garden in front of her little Christo and Maria statue.

Idk why, but if I didn't do it i had this odd guilty feeling in my gut and it was also nice to collect my thoughts in the morning and made my mom and grandma proud.

When I turned 8 I had a very inappropriate interraction with one of my school teachers that I never told anyone.I won't say much as far as the fact that I was no longer a Virgin so the night of that experience I want home and prayed that I would be forgiven. It all happened against my will but I was too scared to say no. I was also too scared to tell my mother or grandmother because I felt like they'd misunderstand the situation and punish me. I feel like if I was a girl maybe they'd say different but I don't know

So I decided if I didn't confess and ask for forgiveness I'd be doomed to hell. So I woke up extra early at 4 am on my own. My anxieties woke me up I suppose. And I decided to go to the garden and pray once more.

I asked for forgiveness and such and even started to cry. I just repeated and repeated till the sun came up I even punched my downstairs parts to punish myself.
The sub was starting to come up and so I decided to close my eyes. I asked once again for forgiveness and I heard the voice of God.

"Open your eyes" 

And this voice? It didn't sound like it came from anywhere like not in front or behind.  It was more like in my head, BUT I could feel a presence in front of me and it was scary. Like I was overcome with pure terror. 

I remember it kept repeating "open your eyes child" over and over again. And each time it did I could hear ringing like tinnitus type ringing but also like a sustained ambient horn-like noise in D minor I think? And it would get so loud that it was deafening. And I couldn't even hear myself cry.

I was so damn scared even if I wanted to close my eyes even if the face in front of me was the face of God the idea of it was too scary to approach. I couldn't bring myself to open myself and my eyes to him. It gave off the vibe that like it felt disrespected. I just kept asking for it to forgive me but I couldn't even hear myself talk.

And theb suddenly it all went silent and even though my eyes were closed I could slowly see the scariest face I had ever seen in my life appear in the blackness of behind my eyelid. Like I had to see them even of I decided to keep my eyes closed like I had no choice.

It was a human face but it had a lot of fury. Eyes were like that of a tiger and it had an angry expression with widened eyes. Like how my mom looks at me when she yells at me. It looked like the head of some sort of corpse and halos began to like eminate from the center. Ally vision was like an infinite mandala with a face in the middle emanating light.

And the feeling I had was like something you get from one of those Rollercoaster drops. I could feel God closing his fist around my heart like he was going to throw me in hell himself. He then said "you have failed me"

I remember being I. A strange state where it was kind of dream like and I felt like I could see through my eye lids and I decided to open my eyes but it was like my eyelids were made of glass and I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or not but the image of dissapointed God slowly faded away and I was just sitting there crying in front of the statues whilst my ears were ringing.

And I believe I sat there until like 8:20 and I just Got up, went to the bathroom, vomited my whole everything out in the toilet and went to sleep on the bathroom floor. I failed him because I couldn't overcome my fear and open my eyes in time.

At that point I felt like I was doomed for hell. And threw away my second chance.

The house carried on like normal but I never said a thing.  My mom kept asking me what was wrong but I couldn't even speak. All I could think about was God's scary face. Ever since then I couldn't enter the garden or any place of christ without the scary guilt in my gut forming a fear like sensation. I had thus feeling like I wasn't welcome anymore.

Looking back on it now I think I was sleepwalking? I'm still not sure. His face still haunts me to this day and every now and then I hear the blasting horns and the feeling of him watching me.
