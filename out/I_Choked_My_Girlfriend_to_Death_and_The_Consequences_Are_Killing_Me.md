Hello everyone, I really don't know how to get my head around the events of last few days that have been going on with my life. It's so hard to put it into words.. I ended up writing and deleting the whole thing couple of times. Nevertheless, this is something that I need to take off of my chest, so I'll just go to the beginning. 

It all started when I got bored with my relationship with my girlfriend. Her name was Jenny.  Jenny liked music, her favorite band was killers, she really liked movies, mostly romantic comedies, enjoyed walking in parks, taking pictures. Jenny is sweet, nice (fuck here I go again making a mistake talking about her in the present tense). Jenny was nice, sweet, caring, loyal, anything  you could ask from a girl, but you know how it is. Sure it's nice for the first couple of months, but slowly it all gets so mundane and boring you want to change something. Mostly it was problems in bedroom, same boring sex over and over again.

So I decided to have a talk with her about making things more fun in the bedroom. At first she was taken a back, cause she's really into more gentle stuff, but in the end, after some back and forth she agreed. Mentioned she was ready to explore some new things too. 

At first it was really fun, I could tell she was enjoying it too. I remember being super excited going back home so that we could try new things, but that's when it happened. We decided to try out shibari. You know it's a thing when you tie up your partner with special ropes, at first it was fun, but then something happened, in the middle of the process we were enjoying ourselves and I think I got to into it and started chocking her. She used to make exaggerated facial expressions for the sake of the process, so I thought she was just playing it and  wasn't paying attention. In the end turns out I really chocked her to death. Fuck it was a terrible experience. 

Now I know what I did after that was terrible. I was too much of a coward to actually go and call the police, so I just left her apartment and went home. In the end one of her friends found her, after couple of days. I felt terrible, I know you guys think I'm a shitty person, but I was feeling really guilty.  How could I do something like that to her and leave her there? shit I felt awful.

That's when it all started. At first it was strange sounds, objects being misplaced, things I couldn't find, which I knew I had in my house. but I thought nothing of it. I mean I was stressed and overwhelmed with guilt. It's normal right? But soon it all became really intense... 

as usual I climbed into my bed to go to sleep at arond 3 am, cause insomnia was yet another thing that I got after the incident. I did hear sight creaking but thought nothing of it, closed my eyes to go to sleep. That's when I heard someone humming a song:

"We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same  
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain"

 and then I heard a clear whisper: 

"Jenny send you her regards."

I opened my eyes, my heart racing and almost had a heart attack. There was this thing sitting on top of me, it looked human, had long straight black hair, but it didn't have a face, as if someone deleted it with an eraser, I could feel their cold hands on my neck chocking me with all their might, I was coughing trying to free myself, as I was completely losing sight, with my one last resolve I hit it in the face and ran as fast as I could out of the apartment. I managed to get my keys and start running my car, my hand was shaking so I couldn't start it in time. That's when I heard that humming again:

"She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go  
She couldn't scream while I held her close  
I swore I'd never let her go"

That cold sound again, that automatically filled my whole body with fear and terror, this time the faceless face (if you can call it that) was sitting in my car, I could see it in the mirror, holding a knife, blond curly hair coming down it's shoulders. It swung the knife against my face, I felt a sharp pain on my left cheek but managed to open the door and bolt out, blood dripping from my face. I ran as fast as I could again, road looked deserted, I grabbed my phone to call my friend for help. I was practically desperate to hear his voice at this point., finally call went through.

"Hey man I'm in trouble can I come over?"

It was static, then I heard the muffled humming again.

"Tell me what you wanna know  
Oh, come on, oh, come on, oh, come on  
There ain't no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine"

I turned around abruptly and saw it again. Faceless thing, with red long hair, as if it was made with blood swinging a baseball bat, this time I felt sharp pain in my nose, blood dripping in my mouth, I felt on my knees, coughing out blood, vision getting blurry. I still managed to see two more faceless things. Black haired was holding a hammer, blond one a knife. All three of them were dressed like girls.

"Who the fuck are you guys.." was all I managed to mumble out, with all the blood in my mouth, I could taste iron, making me vomit. "I can give you money.. just stop.."

"Jenny send us from hell bitch!" That cold sound coming from the one with a hammer. "We're just couple of girls who got abused by assholes like you while being alive!"

"And we're here to take revenge for our fellow girls!" She started swinging the baseball bat at me again, I felt sharp pain this time in my head and dropped to the ground. I could see stars in my eyes. "Jenny's lonely without you, so we'll be helping you go down to hell to her!" 

"Are you gonna kill me?" I coughed out blood.

"Oh yes we're gonna! but not yet!" The one with the knife started approaching me slowly. "We're gonna kill you only after you start us begging for death you asshole! until then we're gonna make your life living hell, get you used to place where we'll take you."

I started losing my consciousness, after the hammer girl broke my seventh finger. I felt so much pain, terror, fear. The worse part was their singing they kept on chanting it, their voice inhuman, devoid of any mercy, they were just humming it while mutilating my body:

"And then you whisper in my ear  
"I know what you're doing here"  
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on  
There ain't no motive for this crime  
Jenny was a friend of mine"

I woke up in the hospital. Police was also there, I gave them the details, but didn't mention whole hell and faceless details. I'm sharing this to maybe get some sort of closer or, feedback that will help me survive this mess. All my fingers are broken, I have multiple cuts on my body, my left ear was bitten off and they really fucked up the thing between my legs', I'm not sure if it's gonna work anymore properly. 

But the worse thing is the fear, fear that they're out there and they can come back to me at any moment. I don't know how to live my life now, they could be anywhere, I'm so fucking scared. The worst part is I keep hearing that damn song, I don't get it where it's coming from, it's stuck in my head "jenny was a friend of mine, Jenny was a friend of mine."
