I have always been a nomad at heart. Travelling, exploring, and experiencing new cultures has always been my passion. So when I stumbled upon a beautiful and intact castle in the midst of my journey, I couldn't resist the urge to go inside and take a look.

The castle was nestled in a remote and desolate location, with no signs of human life around. As I approached, I couldn't help but admire the grandeur of the castle. It was a magnificent structure, with towering spires and intricate carvings adorning its walls. The castle exuded an air of mystery and intrigue, luring me closer with each step.

Without a second thought, I pushed open the heavy wooden doors and entered the castle, my heart racing with excitement. To my surprise, the interior of the castle was perfectly preserved, as if frozen in time. The walls were adorned with beautiful tapestries and paintings, and the furniture was ornately crafted. But what caught my eye the most was the woman standing before me.

She was the epitome of beauty, with long dark hair cascading down her back and emerald green eyes that seemed to hypnotize me. She wore a flowing white gown that accentuated her curves, and a gentle smile played on her lips as she welcomed me into her home.

'Welcome, traveller. I am glad you have found your way here,' she said, her voice soft and alluring.

I couldn't take my eyes off her as she led me to the dining hall, seating me at an intricately carved table. As I sat down, my senses were greeted with the tantalizing aromas of food that filled the room. I glanced at the woman, who smiled and gestured for me to begin my meal.

The food was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. It had a subtle sweetness to it, with a hint of a spice I couldn't quite place. It was a feast for my taste buds, and I couldn't resist taking more and more bites. But as I savored each mouthful, I noticed something peculiar. The food seemed to be changing texture and taste with each bite. Sometimes it would taste like meat, others like vegetables, and sometimes it would taste like nothing at all.

Confused, I looked at the woman who continued to smile and eat her food as if everything was normal. But her smile seemed to hold a secret, a hint of malice hidden behind it. Nonetheless, I shrugged off the strange taste and continued to enjoy the meal.

After we finished our meal, the woman led me to a bedroom, her hand entwined with mine. Her touch sent shivers down my spine, and I couldn't resist the desire building up within me.

We undressed each other slowly, our hands exploring every inch of skin. Her skin was soft and supple, and her touch was electrifying. But as we moved towards the bed, I noticed a strange sensation. Her body seemed to change, becoming colder and rougher under my touch.

Ignoring the strange feeling, I continued to explore her body, my hands tracing every curve and crevice. But as I moved downwards, I couldn't help but feel a sense of discomfort. Her body felt dry and rigid, almost like sandpaper against my fingers. I closed my eyes, trying to ignore the feeling and focused on the pleasure coursing through my body.

But as we really began to make love, the discomfort only grew worse. Her lady parts felt like a hollow cave, devoid of any warmth or wetness. I could feel my shaft rubbing against bones, and with each thrust, I could hear a sickening crunch. But I didn't stop, giving into the pleasure despite the discomfort and unease.

It was only when I opened my eyes that I realized the horrifying truth. I was having sex with a skeleton. The woman before me was nothing but bones, held together by a few strands of hair and decaying flesh. The shock of the realization was like a bucket of ice cold water being poured over me. I recoiled in disgust, trying to untangle myself from her grip.

But before I could escape, the woman spoke, her voice echoing in my mind. 'You have tasted my food. You have tasted my body. All illusions created by my power. And now, you will never leave this castle.'

With a final laugh, the woman's illusion disappeared, leaving me alone in a dilapidated ruin of a castle. The truth hit me like a ton of bricks. I remember reading a book about parapsychology years ago and recognised that I probably had been lured into this castle by the power of psychic projection, and everything I had experienced here was nothing but a figment of my imagination.

I ran out of the castle, my mind consumed with horror and disgust. But the damage had been done. The experience had left me paranoid and clinically insane. I could no longer trust my own senses, fearing that they could be manipulated by the power of psychic projection.

As I continue on my journey, I can't help but wonder about the true nature of the castle and the woman who lived there. Was it just a twisted game played by the ghost of a woman who had died in that castle? Or was it something much more sinister, a warning to all travelers to never wander too far into the unknown? Whatever the case may be, I will never forget that horrifying experience and the lesson it taught me â€“ never trust what you see and always be on guard for the hidden dangers lurking in the darkness.
