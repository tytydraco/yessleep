As I lay here in my hospital bed, I can’t help but wonder just what that drug was, and what it did to Lisa’s mind to make her do such a horrible thing. The cops apparently have no leads yet, and everyone in my contacts I’ve reached out to has no clue. So, I have to ask here and anywhere else I can if I want to find the answers I desperately seek. Has anyone heard of the underground rave drug called “Crimson Teardrops”?

I guess I should start at the beginning to further elaborate. My name is Sarah, I’m 25 years old, and this all began last Saturday night. My Girlfriend Lisa and I were at an underground rave in our home city of Seattle, everyone dancing, drinking, partying, and vibing to the blasts of EDM music that rocked the abandoned underground warehouse we were in while beams of multicolored light dazzled everyone’s drug addled brains in different ways depending on what specific cocktail of pills and powders they were on at the time.

 

At one point, probably somewhere between midnight and 1 am, our go-to drug dealer Faust approached us, a tall and lanky blonde man several years older than me with the facial features of a rodent. He smiled, unnaturally large, his sharp teeth tightly interlocking with each other in his clenched jaw state and held out a small red pill the shape of a teardrop, which I first assumed was just MDMA pressed into a peculiar form, probably a specific dealer’s signature of authenticity.

 

“Want a free taste!?” Faust asked, struggling to unhinge his tightened jaw. It was then that I noticed just how bloodshot his eyes were, so much so that blood seemed to be pooling around his tear ducts, threatening to spill over and run down his cheeks.

 

“Sure!” Lisa replied as she stopped dancing and running her fingers through her long blonde hair, reaching out and taking the pill from Faust.

 

I caught her wrist before she could plop the pill into her mouth, stopping her.

 

“What is it!?” I turned back to Faust to ask.

 

Faust shrugged with a devilish giggle. “It’s the new drug hitting the scene!” He explained. “It’s called ‘Crimson Teardrops’! Everyone’s getting a free taste tonight! It makes you feel invincible!” His eyes went unnaturally wide, his pupils dilated. “Like you could do anything! Like you could embrace your wildest intrusive thoughts, and no harm would ever come to you, because you can’t be harmed, not while in his sweet and loving embrace!” He hugged himself and smiled, yet the smile resembled more that of a shark that had just smelt blood in the water rather than someone being comforted and cared for.

 

“Sounds good to me!” Lisa yelled over the beat of the music, but I kept her wrist held firm, our hands now down by our waists.

 

“Okay, thanks Faust!” I offered with a reassuring smile. “We’ll give it a try!”

 

Faust nodded stiffly and then prowled away, giggling to himself as I turned my back to him and pulled Lisa to do the same, forgetting to even offer me my free taste of the drug, not that I wanted it.

 

It was then that I felt the instinct you get when someone is watching you, and I turned to face whoever it was. My vision tunneled across the warehouse, through the gaps in the crowd, to pinpoint a red robed figure with the hood pulled up to cover their head peering directly at me with hidden eyes.

 

We stared at each other for a few moments, and then I felt Lisa’s hand pulling up to plop the pill into her mouth, attempting to break free from my grasp.

 

“Don’t!” I urged, turning to face her, and then turning back to keep my eyes on the robed figure, though they were now nowhere to be seen.

 

“What’s your problem!?” Lisa asked in disdain as she tore her hand free from my grip.

 

“Don’t take it!” I urged. “We don’t know what it is, or what it could do to you!”

 

Lisa sighed with a shake of her head, briefly rubbing her eyes with her thumb and forefinger. “When did you become such a prude!?” She scoffed at me. “It’s Faust!” She shot her hand in the direction he had stalked away in. “He’s never wronged us before, and why would he start now!? We’re loyal customers, after all!”

 

“Please,” I replied. “I don’t trust it! Just don’t take it, for me!”

 

Lisa stared blankly into my eyes for a few moments, then sighed, and shoved the pill into the skintight pockets of her jeans. “Fine!” She relented with exaggeration, leaning in to kiss me softly for several seconds as our lips intertwined and she rubbed her fingers through my short black pixie cut.

 

My heart fluttered as I brought my hands up to gently grab her forearms, tracing my fingers up and down them as we embraced.

 

She pulled away from me after a while, staring lovingly into my eyes with a seductive smirk. “Can we get back to dancing now!?”

 

I nodded repeatedly, staring back into her eyes lovingly as a huge involuntary grin spread across my face.

 

Her smirk deepened as she noticed how flustered the passionate kiss had gotten me, she loved getting me riled up.

 

She took my hand then, noticing the red smears the pill had left behind on the thumb and forefinger of her other hand, wiping them on her jeans in an attempt to clean them. “Come on then!” She called out as she pulled me away deeper into the crowd, both of us beginning to seductively intertwine our bodies as our dancing resumed, occasionally being brushed up against by other people in the crowd, though we didn’t mind none, and to me, the only other person I cared to dance with was her.

 

As the night drew on, I noticed several members of the biker gang "Einherjar of Valhalla" making the rounds through the rave, one of the members with curly black hair and a goatee appearing to be handing out “Crimson Teardrops” as well.

 

Probably less than an hour after our encounter with Faust, a nasty fight broke out throughout the crowd, fists being thrown, bottles being smashed, and I could see that at least one of the bikers was caught up in the scuffle, as well as at least a dozen other random faces from the crowd.

 

This time, Lisa was the one to get protective towards me, taking me by the hand and pulling me out of the crowd before we could get caught up in the melee as well.

 

I watched as the biker hit a young man so hard in the head that an audible crack could be heard over the music, and the rave goer went down unceremoniously. A bottle sailed through the air and crashed into the screen displaying trippy visuals behind the DJ, just barely missing his head before shattering upon making impact with the brick wall behind the projector screen, and the music quickly came to a stop, revealing countless screams of rage, terror, and pain echoing throughout the space.

 

I caught a glimpse of Faust then, seeming to surge up out of the crowd with streams of crimson tears running down his cheeks, and I couldn’t tell if they were from an injury he received in the brawl or from the drug he had offered to Lisa and myself. His shark-like grin remained proudly on his face, however, and he brandished a jagged and broken bottle that he held at the neck, bringing it down back into the crowd to impale the broken glass into someone I couldn’t see caught up in all the chaos.

 

“Faust just stabbed somebody!” I gasped.

 

“Come on!” Lisa urged, continuing to pull me away. “We need to get out of here before the cops show up!”

 

Just before I turned to hurry along with her, I noticed another red robed figure standing just outside of the brawling crowd made up of at least two dozen people by now, watching the violence ensue intently with a close-mouthed smirk spread across their face. I didn’t know if it was the same individual from earlier or a new one entirely, but this time, they seemed to sense me, turning to face me, peering at me with eyes hidden under their hood, and then they hurried away, disappearing into the retreating crowd behind them.

 

The robed figure gave me the creeps, but self-preservation and Lisa’s as well took precedent right now over anything, so I turned and followed her out of the warehouse and back up onto the street, into the freezing night air of Washington in Winter.

 

We could hear police sirens blaring in the distance, growing ever closer, as surely several rave goers had called the police once violence had broken out on such an extreme scale, unlike anything I had personally seen before at one of these secret events.

 

“Come on!” Lisa urged, pulling on my arm again, and we hurried the 2 or 3 miles home to our apartment, managing to evade the law as well as any physical harm from whatever violent rave goers had started the brawl.

 

I just remember glimpses after that, of us sitting blankly in fear on the couch, shivering from the cold as the heat of our apartment slowly warmed us back up, then laughing in relief, having another drink, making out and some foreplay, hydrating a bit, and then passing out in bed, too exhausted from the come down to do anything more but sleep.

 

The next morning, as I woke, my head pounding with sharp stings of pain traveling through my brain and nausea roiling in my guts, I saw that Lisa was already awake, sitting on the edge of the bed, holding her head in her hands, her blonde hair a multi-directional mess traveling out around them.

 

“Fuck this,” She said. “I’m not spending my Sunday in hungover misery.” She reached over to her nightstand, grabbing up a small crimson teardrop shaped pill, that my recovering brain didn’t recognize at first, and a glass of water, and then she downed them both.

 

I reached out at the last second to try and stop her, but my half-asleep reaction speed was too late, and all I could do was sigh in defeat, allowing my arm to fall weakly to the bed.

 

“You shouldn’t have done that,” I groaned out as I buried my face into my pillow.

 

“Fuck it,” Was all she offered back as she got to her feet, heading to the bathroom to pee.

 

“It’s your funeral,” I called back after her as she entered the bathroom.

 

I could hear her urine hitting the water in the toilet for some time, and once she had wiped and flushed, I painstakingly got to my own feet and entered the bathroom for my morning piss as well, grabbing my cell phone off my nightstand on my way.

 

After I had finished up in the bathroom, I met her in the kitchen where she was slowly sipping down another glass of water and getting tofu, green onions, and a few other odds and ends out of the fridge to make breakfast.

 

I had other priorities, however, immediately pouring a mug of coffee from the Keurig and grabbing the bottle of Pink Whitney out of the freezer and downing three larger than shot sized gulps to curve my hangover with a sigh of burning relief, barely holding back from turning to throw up into the kitchen sink.

 

“Gonna catch a smoke,” I said as I screwed the cap back on the bottle of Pink Whitney, placed it back in the freezer, closed the door, grabbed my mug of fresh coffee, and kissed her on the cheek.

 

She groaned in reply, chopping up tofu and green onions with the biggest kitchen knife in the block set.

 

I made my way out to our apartment balcony then, grabbing my pack of Marlboro red shorts and my lighter from the cup holder of my camping chair set up there, pulling out a smoke, lighting it, and taking a long and welcome drag of toxic fumes to fill my young and surely already damaged lungs from years of inhaling all manner of toxic substances into them.

 

I unlocked my phone then as I leaned over the balcony railing, continuing to drag my smoke as I opened Twitter. My feed was immediately spammed with various repostings of news reports covering last night’s breakout of violence at the illegal underground rave. Apparently 3 people had been killed, while several more had been hospitalized with serious injuries, some even in critical condition. Several arrests had been made, including one Byron Faust for multiple counts of assault with a deadly weapon, attempted murder, and possession of illicit substances with the intent to sell.

 

“Holy shit,” I blurted out involuntarily as I continued to scroll and read through the posts, soon finishing my cigarette and lighting up another. I felt horrible for those who died or were injured, and also lucky that Lisa and I had escaped unscathed, though my fear and paranoia began to grow. *Would we get in trouble for having been there? Would we need to speak to the police?*

 

I decided then that was the last illegal rave I’d ever be attending.

 

I continued reading for some time until I felt I’d absorbed all the information there currently was on the subject, downing three cigarettes in total and my mug of morning black coffee, and then I made my way back inside, shoving my cell phone into the pocket of my sweatpants.

 

“Fuck, Dude,” I said as I made my way back to the kitchen. “You’re not going to believe this!”

 

I found Lisa standing there frozen, facing away from me and towards our stove top and oven. Something seemed off about the way she was standing, how her head was craned to the side, how her body twitched sporadically out of nowhere and then calmed a second later.

 

“Babe?” I asked. “Are you okay? Are you feeling sick?”

 

It was then that I heard the dripping, or rather, I had been hearing it the whole time, but it was then that I realized it wasn’t coming from the sink. I followed the sound, spotting the streams of blood that were splashing down to the linoleum floor in between Lisa’s bare feet, already beginning to form a puddle there.

 

“Lisa!” I cried out in shock. “Look at me!”

 

Her twitching form slowly twisted unnaturally to face me, revealing her carved up face, one of the cuts across her left cheek being so deep that you could see the gritted teeth of her unnatural smile through it. Blood trailed down from the tear ducts of her unnaturally wide and dilated eyes. And as she finished turning to face me, I could see the blood-soaked kitchen knife in her right hand, and the huge chunk of skin and muscle that had been filleted back off her left forearm and now dangled limply from it.

 

“Lisa!” I rushed forward, immediately knowing whatever that pill had done to her brain was the cause of this, and knowing I had to stop her before she did anymore harm to herself. “Give me the knife!”

 

I grabbed ahold of her bloody hands and tried to wrestle it from her grip, but through the bloody slipping and sliding, it had managed to trace a deep gash across my left forearm, causing me to wince in pain and instinctually take a step back.

 

Lisa then swung out in a wide arch, cutting another gash through my T-shirt and into my chest, just above my right breast. “Lisa!” I gasped, reaching up to touch my chest, and bringing back blood-soaked fingertips. “You just fucking cut me!”

 

“I have to get the shkin off,” Lisa whispered, blood spilling forth from her mouth and slurring her words. “It’sh holding all the blood in. He needsh the blood to be shpilled to dampen his shoil, sho that he can grow big and shtrong, to feed hish leavesh and branchesh, of courshe.”

 

She continued carving into her left forearm then, further working to remove the piece of meaty flesh dangling from it.

 

“Lisa! Put down the fucking knife!” I screamed in a desperate plea, now overcome with the purest terror I had ever felt before in my life, beginning to slowly reach for my phone in my pocket to call 911.

 

“He needsh a shea of blood,” Lisa continued. “You shee?” She turned her blood-filled eyes up so that her gaze could meet my own, now terrified and filled with tears. “Sho much that it can reach all the way down to hish rootsh and keep him fed for eternity. I’m going to have to get your shkin off ash well, I shuppose.”

 

Her neck twisted unnaturally, her shark-grin and blood-filled eyes now fully trained on me as she brandished the knife in my direction.

 

I slowly backed away as all my priorities switched to my own survival now, feeling just how much mortal peril I truly was in. Lisa was gone, at least for now, and I had to focus on my own self-preservation if I intended to survive the next few minutes.

 

I continued backing away and towards the front door to our apartment as Lisa stalked towards me, keeping an eye on the knife in her hand as I did so.

 

“It feelsh sho good to bleed for him, to feed him,” Lisa moaned out in ecstasy. “You’ll shee.” She lunged for me then, plunging the knife in my direction.

 

I don’t even know how I did it in the moment, I guess from just pure survival instinct and adrenaline, but I thrust outward and high with the heel of my bare foot, shoving it into her sternum with all the strength of my legs and launching her onto her back on the now blood-stained carpet flooring of our apartment’s living room.

 

I heard her wheeze from the wind being knocked out of her and I ran for the door, my bloody fingers fumbling with the locks for a moment before managing to get the door unlocked and opened.

 

I rushed outside, but then I felt her slam into me from behind, painfully knocking me down to the concrete walkway that connected our apartment and our neighbor's on this portion of the second floor.

 

I screamed in terror, immediately flipping around underneath her into a better defensive position, our mixed blood lubing the roll.

 

She attempted to stab down at me with one hand, but I caught her wrist and shifted the knife around so that it couldn’t pierce my body. She tried to claw at me with the fingers of the other, but I held it back with my right forearm as I shoved my own palm into her screaming face, digging my fingertips into her eyes as I violently pushed her terrifying face back and away from me.

 

She bit deep into my palm, drawing blood, and I screamed, her bigger frame overpowering me.

 

I used my smaller size to my advantage then though, managing to curl my knees up towards my chest underneath her, now pushing her up into the air with them, and then I brought my feet up to press into her torso, shoving her further back, and with a push of all my effort, launching her back off me and into the door frame of our apartment.

 

I grabbed the only thing within reach then, a big flat rock by our front door that we’d sometimes put money under for Door dash drivers or a spare key for friends that needed somewhere to crash while we’re not home.

 

Lisa screamed and crawled back towards me on all fours, brandishing the knife still in her hand.

 

“Please stop!” I screamed and begged.

 

She plunged the knife down, stabbing it deep into my right thigh.

 

I screamed in agony and reflexively smashed the rock into the right side of her head without even telling my body to do so.

 

Her head dropped, now slightly concave with blood trickling down it.

 

After a few seconds, it began rising once again, however, now twitching from brain damage, not just the drug in her system, and she began twisting the knife in my leg as she groaned and looked up to face me with a now slacked jaw and a lazy right eye filling with even more blood.

 

I screamed in more pain, terror, and true sadness as I knew that this only ended in one of two ways and made my choice.

 

I hefted up the rock again in both hands, and brought it down, again and again. At first the sounds that rang out from the connection of rock hitting skull were cracks, then wet cracks, then wet crunches, then wet squelches as her head sank in and split apart, revealing splattering brain matter after just a handful of hits.

 

She dropped and went limp on my legs, releasing the knife, but I didn’t stop until I was sure her brain was destroyed, and she could no longer hurt me as I screamed and bawled, bringing the rock down over and over again, splitting apart the head of the women I loved. The love of my life.

 

I dropped the rock after I don’t know how many hits, holding myself up with my abdomen and my now soaked hands on the concrete as my dead lover lay limp across my legs, one of which had a huge knife protruding up out of it.

 

I didn’t even register it then as my neighbor rushed out of his apartment, looking me over and attempting to stall my bleeding. “Oh my god! Sarah!? What the hell happened!?” I remember him asking now, but I didn’t register it then, I just continued to scream and cry.

 

I remember his wife’s shrieks from behind me.

 

“Call 911, now!” I remember him instructing her.

 

But it wasn’t until the EMTs arrived that I stopped screaming, buried my face into the chest of the closest one, a handsome young man who was trying to comfort me and get me stable enough to move onto a backboard to carry me down the stairs and to the ambulance, though I lost consciousness before I ever got that far.

 

I awoke in the hospital, emergency surgery on my leg already completed, my wounds sewn shut, morphine flowing through my veins. I had been put into a medically induced coma for 3 days while they operated on me to save my life and fix me up.

 

Lisa was obviously unsavable, however.  

 

The cops questioned me, and I told them everything I knew, the truth about being at the rave, what had happened there, the drug, Lisa attacking me, everything. I even told them about the red robed figure I had seen, as somehow, I knew that individual, or those individuals, if there were more than one of them, was somehow involved.

 

They informed me that they didn’t have a solid lead on where this drug was coming from yet, or why it was causing psychotic and violent behavior in those who take it but assured me that they were still thoroughly looking into it.

 

Most of our friends, and Lisa’s family, wanted nothing to do with me after finding out I killed her, even if it was in a life-or-death self-defense. They didn’t want to hear it, and I understood. So, I’m sitting here alone in the hospital for now, as my own religious family cut me out years ago for being bisexual and choosing to love a woman, as well as my promiscuous life of drug experimentation and alcohol use, I’m sure. I know I’ll probably have to go to trial to defend myself in the defense killing, but for now, I’m not under arrest, as all the evidence is clear that it was self-defense and that I had no choice. As we weren’t married, I won’t even get any say about what happens with Lisa’s body. Her family will get all those rights, so my final time seeing her or getting to say goodbye, will be the image of her head crushed in by my own hand as she tried to murder me, though it wasn’t really her trying to murder me, it was the drug. That fucked up evil drug that no one seems to know anything about.

 

So, I have to ask again to anyone out there that will listen, because I will not be satisfied nor will I rest until I find the answers of why this had to happen to us, why the woman I love is dead. Has anyone heard of the underground rave drug called “Crimson Teardrops”?
