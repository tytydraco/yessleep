Not long ago, my mother stumbled upon a forgotten treasure trove of old videotapes, relics from my childhood circa 1990. Her excitement was palpable as she brought them to a photography store, eager to have the man behind the counter “virtualize” them—her words, not mine—and transfer their contents onto a sleek, modern pendrive. It struck me as absurdly poetic: hours of clunky, analog memories distilled into a device small enough to lose between the couch cushions.

The day she retrieved her tiny time capsule, she called me with the enthusiasm of someone unveiling a long-lost artifact. She suggested we meet for tea and watch the tapes together. I hesitated. Nostalgia, for me, has always been a double-edged sword. Old photos, childhood anecdotes—they tend to make me wince more than smile. But her excitement was genuine, almost contagious. So, despite my reluctance, I agreed. If nothing else, it seemed like a small price to pay to make her happy.

When I arrived, she greeted me with a warm smile and a hug, the kind that felt like coming home. The scent of freshly brewed tea wafted through the air as she ushered me inside, handing me a tray of pastries she’d picked up from the bakery. “Set the table,” she said, her voice light and full of purpose, as though this little ritual mattered more than it usually would. I obliged, arranging the sweet treats while she poured tea into delicate cups that had probably seen fewer family gatherings than they deserved.

We sat together, savoring the spread she had so thoughtfully prepared, and the conversation naturally turned to my dad. His new job had taken him north to the United States, a world away. We both admitted we missed him. He’d been traveling back and forth, spending three months abroad at a time, and the distance felt heavier with every trip. Even the phone calls, brief and sporadic as they were, felt more like placeholders than real moments shared.

At some point, I asked if she’d told my sister about the tapes. She shrugged with a nonchalant smile, the kind that only partially hides a deeper thought. “There aren’t many of her,” she admitted softly. “I wanted to show you first, just the two of us.” There was something in her tone—an intimacy, a quiet sense of importance—that made me feel like this moment wasn’t just about the tapes. It was about us.

Before I could finish my second cup of tea, my mother clapped her hands with the eagerness of someone who had waited long enough. “Time to watch the tapes,” she announced, her excitement spilling over. “You can finish your tea on the sofa.” There was no arguing with her, so I followed her lead, carrying my cup as we moved to the living room.

Setting up the TV was straightforward, though she hovered beside me, fussing over the details as if the pendrive held the secrets of the universe. I slid the tiny device into the port and took the remote, scrolling through the files that appeared on the screen. There were seven in total, each unnamed and numbered in the order they had been filmed. No titles, no clues—just raw, unfiltered memories waiting to be unearthed.

We started, naturally, with file number one. My mother settled beside me on the sofa, her eyes bright with anticipation.

The screen flickered to life, revealing nothing but a black void. The display indicated the clip was three minutes long, but there was no image—only darkness. Then came the sound: heavy, uneven breathing, and the faint crunch of footsteps on dry leaves, branches snapping underfoot. It sounded like someone walking through the woods, their breaths growing more labored with each step.

I glanced at my mother. The excitement that had lit up her face only moments ago had vanished, replaced by a puzzled frown. “Skip ahead a bit,” she suggested, her voice uneasy. I obliged, pressing the button to jump forward a few seconds. But nothing changed. The screen remained dark, the footsteps continued, and the breathing grew heavier, almost gasping now. It was then that I realized it wasn’t just breathing—it was a woman. You could hear it in the way the sounds caught and faltered, like someone on the edge of tears.

“Did you record this?” I asked her, my voice low. She shook her head slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, then raised a finger to her mouth, urging me to stay quiet. Her eyes were fixed on the screen, her expression tense, almost as if she were holding her breath.

And then, just before the clip ended, the sobbing began. It was soft, restrained, like whoever was recording didn’t want to be heard. I could tell they were trying to speak—there were faint, broken attempts at words—but nothing coherent came out, just muffled gasps swallowed by silence. My mother gripped the edge of the sofa, her knuckles white, but she said nothing.

The screen cut abruptly, and for a moment, the room felt impossibly still. Then, as if nothing unusual had happened, a new video began to play: my fourth birthday. The bright, joyful chaos of a child’s party filled the screen, but neither of us moved. We just sat there, caught between confusion and unease, trying to make sense of what we had just witnessed.

When the last video ended, my mom and I sat in silence. The room felt heavy, though neither of us said a word. After a moment, I remembered the tea in my hands and took a sip, only to grimace at its coldness. My mother noticed immediately, her eyes flicking to the cup. “Do you want me to heat that up?” she asked, but before I could answer, she had already taken it from my hands and disappeared into the kitchen.

I followed her, the silence still hanging between us like an unspoken question. Leaning against the doorway, I asked the thing that had been circling in my mind. “What do you think that first video was?”

She paused, glancing at me as she set the cup in the microwave. For a moment, her expression was unreadable, but then she smiled—a light, dismissive smile, as though brushing away a stray thought. “Oh, it was probably some mistake,” she said with a wave of her hand. “The man at the store must’ve put it on the pendrive by accident. I’ll go ask him about it tomorrow.” Her tone was casual, practiced even, but I couldn’t tell if it was meant to reassure me or herself.

The microwave beeped, and she pulled the cup out, cradling it as if the warmth in her hands might soothe her own unease. “What did you think of the other videos?” she asked, her voice softening as she handed me the tea. “You were such a pretty little girl back then. Oh, how I miss those times.”

Her words hung in the air, but my mind lingered on the video, on the sound of that woman’s breaths and sobs. My mom’s attempt to steer the conversation elsewhere didn’t feel wrong, but it didn’t feel right either. I sipped my tea and nodded, letting her nostalgia fill the silence, though the unease from that first video remained, quietly gnawing at the edges of my thoughts.

By the time I left my mother’s house, the sky was fading into dusk, the air carrying the weight of an ending day. Before I stepped out, I asked her if I could take the pendrive with me to show it to my husband. She smiled and handed me a second one. “I had a copy made for you,” she said. “It was always meant to be yours.”

When I arrived home, the house was quiet, still bathed in the soft glow of evening. I set my bag down and went straight to my laptop, eager to revisit the tapes, though the memory of that first video lingered uneasily in my mind. As the laptop hummed to life, I slid the pendrive into its port, expecting nothing more than what I’d already seen. But as the files loaded, something new caught my eye—a second folder, one that hadn’t shown up on the TV. My curiosity piqued, I clicked on it.

Inside were a handful of corrupted documents—files with strange, unreadable names—and a single video. My heart quickened as I hovered over it, the unease from earlier stirring again. I clicked, and the screen opened, dark and familiar. Like the first video from my mother’s house, the image was nothing but blackness, but the sound told a different story. The woman’s sobbing was more frantic now, her breaths harsh and desperate. The cracks of branches beneath her feet came faster, sharper, as if she were running.

Then came the rain—soft at first, then heavier, joined by the low rumble of thunder. The atmosphere thickened, the soundscape alive with tension. And then, out of the void, a flash of light. A bolt of lightning struck a tree, illuminating the screen for a fleeting moment. I froze, my finger hovering over the keyboard. Without thinking, I hit pause.

The stillness that followed was deafening. My eyes stayed fixed on the screen, the ghostly outline of the illuminated tree burned into my vision. For a moment, I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. Something about that single frame felt too real, too deliberate. And for the first time that night, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to keep watching.

I steeled myself and pressed play. The burning tree remained in the frame, its flames casting flickering shadows that gave the scene an eerie semblance of life. The camera swayed erratically, capturing glimpses of the turbulent sky above and the muddy ground below. It felt chaotic, disorienting, like watching through the eyes of someone barely holding on.

Then came the roar—a deep, guttural sound that reverberated through the speakers and into my chest. It wasn’t human, and whatever it was, it drove the woman into a desperate sprint. Her sobs turned to frantic cries, her voice trembling as she murmured something about God under her breath. The words were too soft to catch, but their despair was unmistakable.

A deafening boom rang out, an explosion so jarring that it made me flinch. The woman stumbled, her breathing ragged as the camera tilted violently. And then she fell.

The screen glitched, the image fragmenting into streaks of static, but when it cleared, the camera had landed on the ground, its lens now pointing directly at her. I couldn’t see her face, only the back of her head, her short, brown hair matted with rain and dirt. She crawled toward the camera, her trembling fingers brushing against its edges. Then, just as she reached for it, she whispered something—a single word.

My heart sank like a stone, my chest tightening as if the air had been sucked from the room. A strange weightlessness took over my body, and I became hyperaware of everything around me—the soft hum of my laptop, the ticking of the clock, even the faint rustle of leaves outside the window. But I couldn’t move. My limbs felt disconnected from my will, my mind too consumed by what I had just witnessed.

I couldn’t blink. I couldn’t breathe. I was frozen in that moment, trapped by a fear I didn’t fully understand. It wasn’t just the video—it was the way it had burrowed into my mind, unraveling something deep within me. I wanted to look away, to close the laptop, to do anything to break free from the paralysis that gripped me. But I didn’t. Or perhaps, I didn’t want to. Something about the stillness, the helplessness, kept me tethered to that screen, as if moving would shatter the fragile veil between reality and whatever dark truth I had just glimpsed.

Then, a single thought pierced through the haze of fear and confusion. It cut through the stillness like a blade, sharp and undeniable.

"She said my name."
