Hello, I am posting on this subreddit because of a strange experience I had this morning. 

I just came back from the psychologist, and they said somehow my brain is 18 days behind my body. 

The day before had been semi-eventful. I woke up too early, this is because I have been sleeping in the living room as of recently, and my parents always wake up early which means they accidentally wake me up when they do. I always hate this, but say nothing, I went to sleep last night later than I should have. 

I am a senior in high school and the first day of school is coming up soon, so I have been trying and failing to go to sleep early. I tried to catch up on the rest of my sleep in my parents' now empty bedroom. I could sleep in my room, but something about it is hard to sleep in. Maybe it’s the fact that one of the cats had peed on it a few days earlier and I would have to sleep without a mattress topper and change the sheets which I was too lazy to do.

I had a bit of a hard time getting to sleep, I smelled the cat poop on the floor. I am fairly apathetic towards animals. Some people will go running when they see a cute dog to pet, when all I can think about is how much I would rather it not lick me. So you can imagine how I felt about living in a house with 4 cats, and our newest one having trouble being litter box trained. However, it wasn’t my job to clean up its mess, it was my sisters, so I went and got her and told her to clean up the mess. She groaned but did it understanding that it was her job to clean it up. 

Shortly after the mess was cleaned up and I lied back down, I took a nap. When I had finally woken up to start the day, instead of getting up I had just gotten on my phone. Doomscrolled for longer than I care to admit, but at some point my brother came into the room. He knew I was there because this had not been the first day this routine had taken place.  He reminded me of plans that we had for tonight.

I have friends (shocking considering how I spend my days) the same friends as my brother, so I tend to delegate any time or plans I would make to spend with them to my brother, because if I made the plans they would turn out terrible if at all. Apparently tonight I am going to see the new marvel movie with a few of my cousins and friends from church. A bit strange because I was going to see this same movie a couple days later in the week with a different group of friends, but I wasn’t going to question it because I really wanted to see the movie. 

He left and after another embarrassing amount of time doomscrolling, my mom got home from work. I felt a little bad because I should have done something around the house at this point and all I had done was sleep and be on my phone. I got up from my foam tomb to say hello to my mom.

While we were talking she reminded me that it was my turn to make dinner. A couple summers ago I learned how to cook and ever since I had been helping my parents with dinner once or twice a week. Our family had taken on weekly meal planning to save on money and tonight was spaghetti, my brother and sister hated it but it was always my favorite meal of the week.

I had sat down in the living room talking to my mom for a little too long by this point when I should have been making dinner, so at this point she had asked me politely to start making it, which I did.  At some point when making it my dad walked in. He has come back from his new job, he does something at a mechanics shop. I'm never all that sure but it has something to do with paint I think. Shortly after he came home the food got done which meant I would have to go back into the living room to eat. 

I could eat in the back room where my computer is but I know my mom would rather me at least be in there with her. She was watching some show about animals with my sister that they always watched. I really wasn’t interested in it so I just decided to watch something on my phone instead. 

After I was done eating and my parents went to bed, it was time to go out and watch the movie. It was a lot better than all of the latest ones by marvel, so I was pretty happy. It was night when we got home and I decided to go fall asleep by listening to a podcast and playing games on my 3ds, a fairly normal part of my routine.

Tonight I had decided on an hour and a half long review of the movie I had just watched. When it finished, it was finally time to get to sleep, and after saying a small prayer, I found the peace to sleep. I can’t remember what I dreamed about, ever since I was a kid, I have had strange dreams. They were always so normal, I often wouldn’t remember them because of how much they felt like any other day in my life.

When I woke up I was in the living room, but I was on the wrong couch. I was on the smaller couch, the one I never sleep on because I am decently tall and it is more comfortable to sleep on the longer couch. I was also sitting, not lying, and staring at the tv. It was an animal show just like what my mom and sister usually watch. 

However, this time they were crying while watching it. The show was a cat training show for particularly bad cats. And the one on screen looked like one of ours. At that moment a thought crossed my mind, but only for a moment. I turned to ask my sister what was wrong. I wasn’t super connected to my sister and her life, however I was still enough of her brother to care about her and for her to be honest with me.

She didn’t respond. 

My mom asked me “Seriously?” in an accusatory tone. At this moment I was near an anxiety attack because of my confusion. At that moment I said “sorry”, a word that is too often spoken in my family, however the way I said it wasn’t in the usual passing tone, it was one that was clearly peering for more information.

I have always been rather paranoid, it was this paranoia that often kept me from sleep but also the same paranoia that made me consider outcomes that were too outrageous to be true. That paranoia had made a thought cross my head a moment ago, the thought had largely gone away, until now when it was all I could think about.

This split-second between interactions could have taken years and it would have felt the same. The split-second canyon of time ended when my mother spoke up “You made us get rid of him. I did this because I thought it would help you with what happened. You knew how much he meant to me and your sister.”

There had often been moments in the past where I got upset about the cats, but that had been a long time ago, it would be strange for her to have gotten rid of him over night or in the morning. I know she wakes up early but I feel like I would have heard the door open and someone come get the cat. My confusion had overtaken me so much it jumped out of my mouth, “I didn’t ask you to get rid of the cat.”

It was at this moment when the confusion that had left my mouth overtook my mother and sister. “Saturday, you were in tears begging us to get rid of the cat. I knew you were in rough shape mentally, and I gave you this because I knew how much you needed it.” Our house is kept cold all year, summer, winter, fall, and spring 65 degrees, never changes. So when I started burning up all of a sudden I knew it wasn’t because the house was too hot. 

All I could say was “what?”. Which met an almost instant reaction from my mom asking me “Are you ok?”.

I said “I have no idea what you are talking about, I didn’t even see you Saturday, you were at work all day and then when you got off you went out with your friends from work. While I stayed at home and had a hangout with my friends.” 

She seemed to finally catch up to my confusion and she said “What are you talking about you haven’t seen in a week.

Finally I engaged in my normal morning routine of opening up my phone and saw that it was August 18th, the first day of school, and 18 days after I had gone to bed last night.

It was in this dire moment when I turned to my mother and said “Yesterday was July 31st, right?” 

The words seemed to affect my mother deeply “Yesterday was August 17th, You don’t remember anything?”

All I did was solemnly shake my head. “She said sadly, well today is the first day of school, I don't want you to miss it.”

I responded with “The movie I was going to watch, the back to school shopping, I missed all of it?”

She said “you really don’t remember anything that happened to you?” 

Of course I wanted to know what happened to me while in those 18 days, I just didn’t know how to ask the best I could come up with was “Can you tell me?”

She said “if you don’t remember, it’ll be for the best, If I don’t tell you, maybe you can move past it” maybe I could have spent more time probing but I kind of didn’t want to know what happened to me.

I decided to just get ready for school. I usually don’t spend that much time dedicated to my school prep. Throw on a shirt, throw on some pants, brush my teeth, brush my hair, put shoes on and drive to school. When I got to school, I expected to see the massively long line of freshman parents dropping their kids off for their first day of high school, but it was surprisingly small. Strangely enough it looked almost as dead as the end of the year when I found a parking spot for my car (one on the outer edge of the parking lot because it only had 1 exit and everyone rushed to it). 

When I walked inside, what I wasn’t expecting was to be the center of attention. I was not the most popular kid in school, I spent most of my time in school quiet (other than history class, too much of a nerd I guess), and being one of the fattest kids in school doesn’t make you very attractive. Really the only reasons that I have much of any notoriety in school is I was the tallest kid in school up until sophomore year and my brother was fairly popular. So I really didn’t take having nearly the entire student body blankly staring at me as much of a complement. 

I attempted to ignore the eyes, which at this point were slowly receding to their expected positions, and went up to my usual spot in the mornings. Our school allows you to be in two places in the morning in the lunch room or in the gym which is connected to the lunch room.

When I walked into the gym, I got a lot of the same stares, again attempting to ignore them I moved to the other side of the bleachers up to the top left corner. Man, whatever must have happened to me must have been real bad if the entire school heard about it. Just strange because what only felt like 8 or so hours ago I was playing Super Mario 64 ds minigames while listening to a couple of guys talk about marvel, the last thought I had in my mind was school.

 I look up at the digital clock on the wall. My school’s clock is always a minute or two behind, so when it says 7:41 in its bright red numbers I know it is my time to get up and leave. Our school allows us to go to another school for technical classes, but to go we have to leave a few minutes early. I walk out to the bus in the hot august air. One of the vice principals is out there to make sure things go smoothly and he tells us that we will have a substitute bus driver today. We had one for a while last year and he was always late. It's strange to see him again so soon this year. The lady who usually drives the bus was very nice last year, and I attempted to be kind to her. So I was a little sad to see her not there. I got on the bus, the man driving it was not the same one who usually is the substitute. No, it was a fairly young man with curly blonde hair. I know I haven’t seen him before but a sense of deja vu comes over me when the door opens. Because of that I get on the bus without saying anything except my name.

I wait out the long 30 minute bus ride to the technical center. However, when I get there I get the same blank stares again from the members of this other school. Now I'm not that popular in my own school but I'm really not well known at this school.

I walk into my class, It is a computer science class which luckily enough is located right by the entrance. 

I walk in there and feel like throwing up, they are looking at me again.

We got a new teacher for the class this year, because the last one got fired for some reason, and when he sees me his expression drops, but still doesn’t say a word why. The rest of class is uneventful, I’m supposed to be an intern this year but every time the teacher gives instructions to us he leaves me out. 

I get back on the bus, that feeling again, when we get back to my school I decide I am going to pretend I am sick. It has been a while since I have done this, but I used to do it a lot during middle school. I go to the nurses office and say I don’t feel very well and I want to go home. 

Now, every time I do this it’s like playing a game of chess against the nurse and I would usually fail. However this time all she said was sure. She checked my temperature and said it was fine but still was just going to let me leave. I was rather shocked, because it had never been this easy before. But I headed for the office to sign my name on the check out sheet. 

As I’m walking out of the office I hear one of the office ladies say something that catches me off guard. 

All she said was “It never had to happen.”

When I turned around and looked at her, I got nothing back, just a blank stare. I shift my way out the door. God, this day has been confusing. 

I hate driving, having to watch so many people and make sure that your speeding barrel of metal and gas doesn’t kill you or anyone else is a hassle. So having to drive all the way home and back for school is annoying, but I do it anyway.

When I get home I make some lunch and watch youtube on my computer, catching up on all of the videos I missed in those 18 days. I was a little curious what not-me was watching while I was asleep. I look at my watch history. I open it up and it's all a bunch of videos on how to deal with trauma, damn I must have been really depressed. 

Other than that there is really not a lot, but what is there is really strange, survival guides, gun videos, “how to track someone using only a phone number” that’s a weird one, none of these videos are stuff I would watch regularly (except maybe the gun videos, I live in the midwest). I choose not to think about it that much after what I have been through today.

After a few hours of listening to podcasts and playing peggle. My mom gets home, shoot I forgot to text her that I left early for school. I was thinking she was going to be mad but when she came home she seemed happy? Not like my mother is never happy, it just seems like with the way she was this morning, I expected something different.

I ask her if I can see a doctor, because it doesn’t seem healthy to lose 18 days worth of memories. She agreed so we left.

Apparently somewhere in my bloodline I have a native american ancestor which allows me to be a member of a tribe. The best part of which is that I get really cheap healthcare. However I have to drive for a long time to get it, But I guess my mom felt it was worth it to make sure I wasn’t completely off my rocker.

When we finally got there and met with the psychologist, he asked a lot of questions. Some stuff like are you on any medicine or have you been getting enough sleep. However, I had to do some things like trace a pen, or remember a word then repeat it 5 sentences later. They did a few tests like MRI and a blood test.

Now, I’m not sure how he came to the conclusion but he said that my brain was 18 days behind my body. He had never seen anything like it before and by extension neither had I. He said that he doesn’t know what caused it or if it’ll happen again, but he gave me a piece of paper with a number to a clinic and said that if it happens to call. 

When we got back home it was pretty late and I didn’t feel like eating dinner (for once), but my mom said that I haven't eaten in a couple days so I decided to eat. 

Time passes on a long day and when night comes i have a hard time sleeping, so i do what i always do and pull out the 3ds out of a curiosity though i boot up the photos app and see what is in there, to my shock I see an image with a wall of text, it had to be sideloaded on here.

It says “Hello, If you are reading this than you have finally woken up. I have bad news for you. It’s not going to end until you make it end. Who you are now and who I am are not the same yet. You will find out in time. Maybe one day we will meet. Goodbye hopefully for now. With “Love” THYC.”

THYC? I don’t know what it stands for, so I looked it up on google and urban dictionary but I got nothing. I’m writing this post because maybe one of you has gone through something similar, and can help me figure out what is going on?

But for me I am going to sleep, and I don’t know when I’ll wake up.
