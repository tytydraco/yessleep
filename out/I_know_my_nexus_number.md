“Our lives are governed by numbers in more ways than you can think. Just as the pi number governs the circle, Euler’s number governs growth and decay, 0 governs nothingness. Numbers have power. 80 is usually the age when most people die. Numbers are all around us, especially for those with the eye to see. And you will keep that in mind as you begin the coursework for our Algebra course,” Professor Toan talked as our lecture came to a close. I sat twiddling my thumb and occasionally checked my phone to see if time had run out.

“Hey. Trey and Wallace said we’re going out for Vietnamese food tonight. There’s this new place that just opened, they have Bun cha. You in?”

David seemed to be fixated on the lesson and so I had to touch his arm. He looked up and for a moment I thought he seemed annoyed. But he eventually nodded and went back to the lesson. His reaction didn’t surprise me. David was always one of the top students in our department.

The moment the professor finished, I darted out of the lecture room into the cool outside air, got back to my dorm room and slept like a log until it was six in the afternoon. I woke up, a bit disoriented from my nap, freshened up and headed out for the get-together with my friends.

We talked about all sorts of things that evening. Occasionally, fate just hand you one of those occasions that was so jovial, so exhilarating, so free of stress that you couldn’t help but to wonder if it was the calm before the proverbial storm. Occasionally, David seemed to look up to us for a long while. I thought he had something he wanted to share.

“So how are your classes?” Trey asked when we were half-way finished with our meal.

“Just the usual. I’m hoping to pass Advanced Algebra with distinction,” I said.

“You’re full of shit. Maybe I’ll believe it if David said that. What are you doing beside hitting the books anyway David?” asked Wallace.

“I’m assisting Professor Toan with a new groundbreaking concept,” David said, his voice quiet and wavering.

“Cool! Care to explain what it is to us plebians what it is? They say if you can explain a concept to a six years old, then you really understand that concept,” Wallace said.

“It is the concept of nexus numbers. You know how life follows the rules of certain numbers? We’ve been researching numbers that keep reappearing in the lives people and how they correlate to life or death.”

“I’m not following,” I said.

“Imagine this. You read on the newspaper that 13 people were killed in freak accident. The news saddens you, but you’re still removed from it. You walk out on the street and then a car nearly hits you. The first two numbers on the plate of that car is 13. You start to see some patterns. You go to a conference and the moment you walk into the room, the total number of people in that room becomes 13. This repeats and repeats until one day, at 13:00, or 1 P.M for some of you, you walk into an alley and is killed by a mugger. That mugger was just released after 13 years in prison. In a way, the number 13 starts to govern your life and eventually, death.”

“What the hell? So, you mean to say that numbers can kill now?” Trey asked.

“Not kill. More likely, they are a herald of your death. They warn you of your incoming doom.” David replied.

Silence draped over us like a heavy curtain. What David had just said was outlandish, but it was within believability. We meet and see numbers every single day, who’s to say that one of them cannot warn us of our incoming death. I sat there and thought about the numbers that I encountered that day and soon gave up.

“I guess too much Algebra can indeed kill you” Wallace said. His joke helped lighten the atmosphere and I could see the brows on Trey’s face relaxing. Then, something occurred to me.

“How do you know if a number is a nexus number?” I asked.

“You can’t. Not until they start repeating. Look for patterns in your life, there’s bound to be a couple of numbers that repeat in a pattern. Your nexus is among those. However, most people go through their entire life without knowing it.”

“Yeah, and I felt like I could have gone through tonight not knowing about what you’ve said. I’m not buying it, dude. You’re saying that numbers can kill. Whatever, let’s just switch topic” Wallace said.

The evening ended on a low note. We tried other topics, but what David said had us all thinking. I paid attention to all sorts of different numbers on my way back to the dorm. There were 3 other people waiting for the bus with David and me. On the bus, there were a total of 8 people, including the bus driver. The bus stopped at around 10:30. Its front number had 15 for beginning and 26 for end. All around me I saw numbers and my frustration grew because there was no way to tell which was the one that would eventually be my nexus number. Next to me, David seemed to be deep in thought. We didn’t say a word to each other until we went back to the dorm and each of us got to our room. I showered, changed and played a videogame, noting the number of times that I died to a boss. I got to 5 deaths before I turned off the computer and just went to bed.

 As the days went on, my memory of what David said started to fade. The concept of nexus number was chipped bit by bit by the hectic pace of university life and two weeks later, I had almost forgotten about it.

I was sitting at the lecture room that day for my Advanced Algebra class, waiting for Professor Toan. He was 30 minutes late and by that point I was actually expecting that he would call in sick or something and that the class would be cancelled. Bored, I started to look through our textbook. We finished chapter 14. I was just about to pick up my bag and stand up when he rushed into the room, papers flying out of his backpack. Some students had to help him pick up the pieces of paper and stationery that was lying around. He got to his desk, took out a bunch of notes and stammered an apology before beginning the lesson.

I couldn’t focus for the entire lesson, Professor Toan went off topic time and time again. After half an hour of banging his head against the wall trying to teach, he eventually just told us to read the following chapter and write a short report paper and leave on his desk. Audible groans were heard from the audience, but we did what was asked anyway. I looked around for David to see if he knew what was going on with the professor but couldn’t find him. As the class ended, I got to the desk and got a closer look at Professor Toan. His face was pallid and he had bags under his eyes, his hair was disheveled and I caught sight of what looked like a number, written on his hand by something sharp. Afraid of making things awkward if I stayed too long, I gave him my report and walked out of class.

I walked over to David’s dorm room and knocked on the door. For a moment no one answered and I was about to walk away. Then I heard the slow clicking sound of a latch being flipped and the door opened a little bit. I was immediately hit by the smell of stale food and unwashed clothes. David was at the door, or more aptly, he was hiding behind the door.

“You wanted something?” he asked in a scared voice.

“David? What the hell happened to you? Why aren’t you in class today man?”

“Oh, I g-got some work to do” he said with some difficulty. I could realize the lie as soon as it was said.

“Are you okay, David? Is someone after you?” I asked.

At this. He closed the door. I thought he was done talking to me. Then the door opened entirely and the smell of more stale food and old clothes swarmed me.

“Get in” he said. I got into his room and caught sight of boxes after boxes of pizza, bags after bags of old bread. His old clothes piled high in a corner of a room, smelling of sweat and body odor.

“Jesus, David. What happened?”

“I’m hiding from them.”

“Hiding from who?” and in my head, I thought he must have borrowed money from a gangster.

“The numbers.”

“What? Are you crazy?”

“Professor Toan and I, we developed an algorithm to find out the nexus number of each person. It would only need the name and age of a person. His nexus number was 30 and mine was 4.”

The ridiculousness of what he had just said hit me and suddenly I understood why David had to hide. I looked at the boxes, there were at least 6 of each. None of the items in the room counted to four.

“I’ve been avoiding going out on Wednesday and Thursday. I’ve been eating deliveries. I’ve even cancelled my afternoon class that finishes at four. I’m looking for a replacement laundromat because the one closest to us got 40 washers. That’s 4 times 10.  Can’t risk that,”

“David, listen to me. You can’t go on living like this. You need help, man. Let me take you to talk with a psychiatrist, maybe he can help.”

“No. I’ll just have to wait until after the 4^(th) of this month passes, then I’ll be alright.”

“What about the 4^(th) of next month man? And the month after that? Come one David, let me help you.”

“How many sentences have you spoken to me?”

“Uh, I don’t know. Maybe 7-8? Including this one.”

“Quickly, say something else.”

“Uh, psychiatrist.”

“Good, thank you, that made it 9, as long as it’s not a multiple of 4. Go on, get out, I’ll be okay.”

I got up and walked out of the room. Before I left, I looked at David. It seemed like he had something still he wanted to say. Suddenly, a question came to me then, as natural as the seasons.

“David, did you put my name and age in the algorithm?”

He looked at me for a while, his eyes wide open and filled with guilty fear. He was silent for a while and I walked out of the room.

“Just, just avoid the number 15” David said before he closed the door to his dorm room.

I got home that night feeling on edge. I looked around me to spot the number 15 and to my horror, it was everywhere. I started to avoid any street with 15 in its name. I avoided groups with 15 people, but my heart jumped every time my watch showed the number fifteen. I counted every fifteenth steps and stopped to look around. I got home and turned on my computer to watch something to take my mind off the number. I was craving some angel versus demon action and turned on Supernatural and eventually dozed off.

I woke up at 8 that day. There were three missed calls and a text from my ex.

“Please pick up. I’m sorry I cheated on you, it was a stupid decision while I was drunk. Won’t happen again.”

I ignored her and went on with my life. As the days passed, my notion about the number 15 slowly faded. Everything was back to normal, until one week later.

I was heading for the lecture room when I caught sight of a student that I knew passing by. He seemed to be heading away from the lecture room.

“Hey man, you skipping Professor Toan’s lecture today?” I asked.

“No man. Class is cancelled. Professor Toan is gone.”

“What do you mean gone?” I started to feel the heat draining away from my legs and arms.

“He’s dead man. Car crash. It was all over the news yesterday.”

My heart lurched and I immediately opened my phone and got on a news site.

“University Professor killed by drunk driver.

“At 4:30 P.M, Mr. Toan, a Mathematics professor from the university of..” I read the title and the first sentence and my eyes just trailed off. The words of David suddenly came back on my mind, crystal clear

“His nexus number was 30 and mine was 4”

“At 4:30..” and the realization just jettisoned my consciousness into the vast space of realization. I called David. He didn’t pick up. I made a run to his room while calling him. I knocked and  knocked until my knuckles bruised, but no one answered. After a quarter of an hour, one of the guys from the room next door walked out.

“You looking for David? He went to this new laundromat that just opened. He told me to tell you if you got here. Here’s the address. Strange though, he hasn’t been back since yesterday”

I was glad that the address didn’t have the number 4 in it. I started walking and when I arrived, there were police tapes cordoning off one section of the street. I walked into the laundromat and showed the picture of David to the manager there.

“I’m sorry, did you see this man walk into your laundromat?”

“Let me see. Oh man, are you a friend of his? Sorry to tell you, son. He fell into the sewer and hit his head. The ambulance carried off his body yesterday, you could still see them putting on tapes around the cover of that sewer.”

My heart sank into my stomach and sweats dotted my fingertips. I rushed out of the laundromat and looked at the cordoned off sewer hole. It had since been covered with a metal plate. One police officer was still there, seemingly taking notes. I approached and asked him some questions, saying that I was David’s friend. He told me something that made my hair stood on end, David had too much clothes with him and didn’t pay attention to the sewer hole. He fell and died on impact. Camera footage showed that it was 4:30 when he died.

I walked home, dejected and terrified. I broke the news to Trey and Wallace and then showered before hopping on the bed. The events of the day were simply too much for me and I drifted into sleep before I knew it.

When I woke up, it was 3:14. My phone was ringing and the moment I picked it up, the ringing stopped. It was my ex. She had made 14 missed calls. Suddenly, I felt the weight of what David told me. She would only need to make one more missed call before…

I rushed to my phone and called her back. She didn’t answer. It seemed she had gone away. I sat and waited, my eyes fixed on my phone, waiting for her call. I even sent her a text, telling her to call me back. My mind slowly drifted and my eyes slowly closed and before I knew it, it was morning when I woke up.

I cursed myself for falling asleep and looked at my phone. There was another missed call and a text from my ex.

“You jerk. I’m never calling again”

Fear coursed through me and my feet went cold. I called her back and she didn’t respond. I sent her text messages, telling her that I was sorry and after some minutes, I realized that she blocked me. I sat alone in my room, my eyes jumping at shadows every time the clock showed 15.

That was two weeks ago. Since then, I had lived the same way as David did, ordering takeouts and jumping at everything outside my room. I had removed my clock and watch and hadn’t looked at my computer for days. I don’t know what would happen, but I only know one thing, I know my nexus number and I must do everything to avoid it.
