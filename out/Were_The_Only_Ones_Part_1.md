it came apparant to me that we are the only ones on this blue speck of dust.

but it wasn't just because of a mission, but to test if we really are the only ones out there.

Could Alien Life Exist?

it's one of the greatest mysteries. perhaps one of the greatest of all time.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NASA has been probing multiple locations and have been trying to detect any signs of alien intelligence. 

down, right, left, and all-around, they've been going to find what may be the greatest mystery of all.

10 years. 20. years. 40 years. mankind has now known about space for over 50 years since we last went to the moon. but this time, was different. a new mission. a new purpose. a new reality. what more could be?

"hey, I think we're detecting something!", katy says.

"we've been finding the same signals for over 2 generations, katy. 

just admit it. we're never going to find intellegent life out there!"

"not here, not now. not ever!"

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"no, no, yy-y-y-you're wrong! we'll find life out there! we know we will! right . . ..?", Katy asks.

"the records and data suggest that we've been looking for this for years and have still found nothing. we don't even know how this universe came to be and we don't even know why we're here. on earth, of all places. you really think that we'll find something within the next 50 years?! i think at this point we should just give up. our mission will never be complete. mankind will never be able to freely go to space at will."

"everything's too expensive. but that's because we made it this way. that's how it's always been."

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and then... there was the signal.

"I think we're detecting something! send the probe!"

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"roger that."

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as the probe grew ever so closer to the near-by planet that was the closest to earth, it placed itself down and tried to find a sample of water to detect if there was life on the planet. 

"sample 21." - we're trying this, again. this time, we will not fail.

=--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------=

20 years have passed. the results are in. was the mission a success?

"sample 21 - can you hear me?" - "yes, sir." 

" we need to get the data back to earth, now!"

"I'm On My Way."

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the main scientists analyze and truthify whether the water has any sort of bacteria in it.

"oh... no. not this again. how much more of these results are we going to get?!"

"there's no sign of any intelligent life, still! what are we even doing all this research, for?!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

then we head back to NASA's headquarters.

"AGAIN?! THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. SOMETHING IS UP. Chief, anaylze the data accordingly!

"but, but, we don't know and can't know if there is anything in this water!! we've tried this for years already!! it's not going to work! just admit it, planet earth is the only planet with life on it!!"

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I REFUSE TO BELIEVE WE ARE THE ONLY ONES. NOW, HURRY UP AND GET THAT DATA!"

"oh-o-okay sir, o-okay sir..."

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the scientist discovered something rather particular.

"it says here that water is the main source for life to be present. how are you so sure that there isn't life inside of the planet? we can't even dig that far, and our technology is not even that advanced, yet!"

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I don't care how you do it, just make it happen and show to us that there is life out there!!!!"

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the scientist putted up a highly advanced drill that could reach to the center of the earth.

one that could withstand and withhold extreme heat, and pressures and atmospheres.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the scientist started to drill to the center of the planet. "HEAT LEVEL RISING - 90C, 400C, 2,000C, etc..."

the drill seemed to get ever more-so worn out as it continued to drill to the center of the planet.

but the core of the planet looked weird - it looked unlike anything the team has ever seen.

"why is there a bunch of wires around the planet?"

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as they drilled to the center of the planet, the scientist eventually looked out-side, 

and what he saw was shocking.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a bunch of ones and zeroes were all around the center of the planet. 

"is-i-s this... data? how can there be data inside of reality??"

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but this wasn't just any ordinary data. there was something horribly, horribly wrong.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"wh--wh-where's the core?! I don't see anything except for a bunch of numbers!!"

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"i'm heading back. this can't be right. this can't be right, at all."

"\*HUFF\* \*HUFF\* \*HUFF\*, so, I looked at the results and found this:

"a bunch of ones and zeroes were all around the center of the planet."

"WHAT?! SO YOU'RE TELLING ME WE'RE IN A SIMULATION?!!!!!!!!"

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"..... ... i'm... I'm afraid so..."

"HOW CAN THIS BE?!!!!!!!!!! ABORTING ALL MISSIONS! CANCEL EVERYTHING! WE NEED TO TELL THE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS!"

==================================================================

introducing all specimen and humans and all man-kind, reality is not what you think it is.

we're living in a lie. we're living in a simulation. a matrix. that you can't escape from.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

it turns out that... we may just be the only ones. we "ARE" the ALIENS. tell your friends, and family.
