 

I ruffle my dirty blonde hair in the mirror, and I think about what life will be like in my new residence. As I get off of the coach I start to where I will reside for the foreseeable future, a cat crossed my path, which is bad because I am allergic to cats, so my eyes started to water.  While walking to where I will live, I notice that everything seems oddly tall but then again, I am short. As I climb the stairs to where I will live, I quickly get out of breath because I am not the most athletically inclined person, which means that I am a little on the chubby side. The whole being overweight, and a short guy got me bullied a lot in school, thank God I am not ginger otherwise it would have been a hell of a lot worse. And I am cursed with an old first name and a weird last name. My first name is Arthur, and my last name is Venturas.

 As I am walking around, I get the feeling that I am not supposed to be here as the streets are eerily empty. I slowly start to focus on things in the background like children staring at me with fear, old people staring at me with concern, and people my age staring at me with disgust. As I walk to my new home, I notice that the buildings are built in a Victorian style, so I guess this little town isn’t a new place. This town seems to have a large number of trees with no leaves which is odd considering that it is July. As I round a corner the sky starts to rumble as if it is unhappy with my presence in the town. As I cross the street quickening my pace due to the pending thunderstorm, I start to hear a creepy song in the background. The song sounded like a nursery rhyme my late mother used to sing when I was small. As I finally get to the house, I will live in from now on I notice that it is much larger than I anticipated it would be. As I enter the house and start looking around to see whether or not I would need to buy furniture (I don’t) I notice a locked door, I try all of my keys out on the door and none of them worked which is odd as I have like twenty keys, for everything but this one door, I have a key to the fridge but not this one door? 

where is the key to this door and why don't I have it?

I have been living in this small town for about a week and I have had a man knock on my door just to warn me not to go outside after 10, a child knocked on my door and when I opened it he called me fat and an old lady came up to my street and said: “find the key.” I found that rather odd.  As I got out of bed this morning I found a dead pigeon in my slippers, a dead toad in my fridge, and a trail of dead rats to that locked door, odd. I have also noticed that small items I own like cutlery, ornaments, and pebbles seem to go missing now and then. They always end up in front of that locked door, what on earth is going on? As I start to get my shoes on the sky lets out a deep rumble and rain pours down, well so much for my jog. These storms seem to have been happening every day since I moved here. I open my fridge to grab a coke, no, a dr coke, I sigh with disappointment as I realize that this town has no name-brand products.

Since moving into my new house, I have not had a chance to stay inside and watch a scary movie marathon but staying awake did not last long because I don't have a large amount of energy, so inevitably I fall asleep. I woke up, but not in the living room of my current house. I look around where I am and realize I can see people dressed as they would if they went to a will hearing. Then I realize, this is a will hearing, but not just anyone it was my mother's. I hear a discussion about giving me this house in a small, not well-known town. I hear the word sacrifice mentioned briefly by my father, but the sentence got cut short by my uncle who is panicking. Wait? Did they mention sacrifice? Why did I not notice this before? I woke up drenched in sweat, and I realize that there was one place I did not check for the key, the pantry.

I found it. I finally found it. The key. It was in the pantry behind some mixed nuts. Something my fat ass would never eat.

Now that I have the key I have been searching for so desperately, there is only one thing left to do and that is to unlock the door. I hesitantly walk towards the locked door, I grab the key and put it inside the door I turn the key the door opens. I found something you would not expect to find inside a house, I found an altar coated in Latin writing and it seems to give off an ominous vibe. Bang! People start to pound on every window of my house in a zombie-like state. I start to panic as I do not know or understand what is going on. I search the house for weapons, aha! I found a baseball bat that will work for what I intend to do. I go to that mysterious altar and smash it to bits with the bat.

Now that that altar is destroyed things have seemed to calm down. Now that I am thinking about it, maybe destroying the altar might just well have been a good thing. I sit down with an air of triumphant joy and drink a can of dr coke.

Crash!

 I turn around and see one of my windows smashed and a person outside, what do they want? The person tells me to not open the door at all costs, I try to ask questions, but the person leaves as soon as they arrive. I, as a somewhat sane man, listened to his advice. 

Crash!  The door that had to be shut at all times was open. Uh oh. That was not good. Out of the corner of my eye, I see something crawling out of the said door that was not supposed to be open. I now realize what the situation involving the sacrifice my dad mentioned was….
