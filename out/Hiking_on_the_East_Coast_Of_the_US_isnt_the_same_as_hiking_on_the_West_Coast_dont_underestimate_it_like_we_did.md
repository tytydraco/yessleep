Hiking in the Southwestern United States is quite the cultural shock when you’ve lived in in the White Mountains your whole life. It was a new world to me. The silence of the desert was unlike anything I had been used to growing up in New Hampshire. It was jarring not hearing the buzz of cicadas in the summer, or the snow crunching beneath my feet in the winter. The landscape was almost alien, resembling something out of a sci -fi movie and it was absolutely breathtaking.


When we had planned this trip, we knew we would need to do a lot of research before even considering buying a plane ticket. The three of us had never been past the border of New England, let alone the other side of the country. I hadn’t been on a plane before, which was exhilarating on its own. When Lucas graduated college he, Alexander and I had dreamed of exploring somewhere unheard of (to us at least). We never lost touch, even though we all ended up in different places after graduating from our small-town high school. Lucas went the farthest North, choosing to go to University of Vermont to study veterinary medicine. Alexander went south, opting to skip school and work in Newport, Rhode Island on a fishing boat. I wasn’t as exciting, staying in my small town where’d I’d always been to work at my family’s general store. I made good enough money, and I was happy working a boring job to travel New England seeking out the best hiking trails. Acadia, Franconia, The Berkshires, all beautiful, but they still didn’t scratch the itch I had been searching for.


When the three of us were deciding where to go to celebrate plenty of more typical vacation spots came up first. The usual Vegas, Miami, and LA were discussed, but we had grown up with a sense of adventure, so partying in a casino or planking our asses on a beach was never really much of an option.


“My cousin lives near Yellowstone, he said it’s beautiful there.”


“That’s a cool idea, but what about the Badlands? It’s got a badass name and it’s more remote I heard.” Alexander, always one to travel off the beaten path, would undoubtedly choose somewhere with the least number of tourists.


“For someone who hates crowds, you sure made a weird pick choosing Newport to move to,” I smirked.


“Oh, come on Scarlett, maybe Newport is touristy, but I’m on a boat in the ocean half the year! Gimme a break.”


“Will you two focus for once! We have two months before we all took our time off, we have to get this figured out as soon as possible or we’re going to end up climbing Cadillac Mountain for the hundredth time.”


Lucas was annoying, but he was right. We still had our responsibilities to focus on, and if we didn’t pick something soon we would end up doing one of the same hikes we always did. We rarely ever got a weekend together these days, so a whole two weeks was almost unheard of. And as beautiful as the hikes in New England were, it wasn’t the thrill of the unknown we were looking for.


After plenty of deliberating we had finally decided. It had the beauty that I craved, the sense of wonder Lucas was after, and the remoteness Alexander demanded. We were going to “The Maze” in Canyonlands National Park in Utah, one of the most remote National Parks in the entire country. Backpackers were advised to prepare heavily for such a hike, and the chance of rescue should something go awry wasn’t a guarantee. In fact, we were required to have a plan for self-rescue just to obtain our overnight permits. Obviously, we weren’t well versed in hiking in the desert, but we foolishly believed that since we’d hiked Mount Washington, one of the most treacherous hikes in the United States, we’d be able to handle it. We craved the adrenaline rush of potential danger, and we were still young and stupid enough to try our luck at such a strenuous experience.


Despite the foreboding perquisites, we soldiered on. The sun beating down on a tumultuous terrain wasn’t enough to stop us adrenaline deprived adventurers. After hours of hiking we finally decided to take some time to rest.


“It is HOT” Alexander said, sweat dripping from his chin.


“Guys,” Lucas continued, “This is unlike anything we’ve ever seen! This is amazing, I mean, look at this place!”


“Yea maybe we’ll see a gila monster you can dissect or something.”


“Shut the hell up, asshole.” Lucas retorted. Alexander was an ass, but he still knew how to push our buttons in a fun way, making the day go by faster and the adventure we were on more exciting.

 

When I woke up it was dark, the tent that we had set up had a large tear, but both Lucas and Alexander were passed out beside me. The whiskey mixed with sun had clearly done them in. There was a strange noise coming from outside the tent, but I had read too many stories to try to pursue it on my own. Instead, I sat inside and gripped my knife harder than I had on previous trips. Being the only woman on a hiking trip was certainly scary, but I felt safe with my friends. With them asleep however, it was always overwhelming.



“Harper, are you okay?” Lucas woke up with a start.


“Yeah, I’m fine.” Lucas tended to be the first to jump in action if Alexander or I were spooked, though Alexander would never admit it.


“Sorry, I thought I heard something…” he said before drifting back to sleep.


I had hiked alone, I had seen terrifying things, and I had certainly been shocked into silence more than once by some being that turned out to be nothing more than a fisher cat or the wind. Adrenaline was still pumping through my veins; how could it not be? Even if I had experience, I was still in a new environment. I had started to calm myself before I felt a hand on my shoulder and let out a scream.


“Woah woah hey relax, it’s okay.” It was Lucas, which wasn’t very surprising to be honest. If anyone was going to check in, it would be him.


“I heard you rustling around, I just wanted to make sure you were okay…”


With just a look I knew the words he said meant more than just a quick check in. Since I had rejected him early October of last year he had been extra caring with me, but not for any nefarious reasons.


Lucas was different, if he didn’t have such an important career maybe I would’ve considered being with him. But I wasn’t planning on doing much with my life. And I was okay with that. I don’t know if he could say the same. Regardless, he always respected my decisions, and I appreciated his understanding of my boundaries, so it was never an issue.


“I found a cabin we can rest in, a bit up the hill. I feel kind of weird sleeping out here in the wilderness…”


Maybe it was the unknown landscape, but I agreed with him. Something about this deserted place raised the hair on my skin.


“Let’s wake up Alexander, he might…” but before I could finish my sentence, we turned around to find him missing.


“Alexander? Hey? Alex you DICKHEAD!?” We both called him all the names in the book to get any type of reaction. He hated being called Alex- “It’s Alexander” he’d say to anyone who dared attempt a nickname.


After twenty minutes we seriously got worried. It wasn’t unlike him to wander off in search of water or some type of “cool” thing he’d be able to show us. But this was far too long. Especially if we’d been calling his name.


“Should we use the satellite phone?” I said, my words dripping with fear.


“No, no.” Lucas sat, stone faced, weighing out our options. “There’s no way he just abandoned camp. He’s probably just acting his usual self. Trying to act ‘cool.’”


His confidence set me at ease, that’s the thing about Lucas, if he weren’t here I’d-

 

“HELP, HELP GUYS!” It was unmistakable. It was Alexander.


“Alexander, hold still, we’re on our way!” Lucas’ confidence was genuinely the only thing keeping me going. I might’ve been brave, but I was still terrified.


Before I could even react, a dark figure jumped out behind the bush.


“Hahahah, you guys, seriously?”


“FUCK you dude. That scared the shit out of us. That wasn’t even funny at all.” I said with glaring eyes. I love Alexander, but this was a new place, and raising anyone’s blood pressure was a foolish thing to do in a place as dangerous as the Maze.


“You’re a fucking asshole, dude.”

“Aw shut up man, you guys were being nasty I couldn’t help myself.”


“Fuck you dude, we thought something happened.” I was pissed beyond belief. Alexander was always cool with us, but this was too much, even for him.


“You guys just need to chill out, and anyways, there’s that cool cabin up ahead. Aren’t you all in it for the adventure?” he said with a devious smile.



“You’re still a fucking asshole dude,” Lucas, being the voice of reason, really wouldn’t let it go.


“Will you piss off man, it’s not a big deal. It was just a joke.”


“Still, fuck you for-”


We were all cut short when we got to the cabin.


I don’t know what it was about this place, or why the hell Lucas thought it would be a good idea to rest, but something about this cabin was off. Now mind you, there wasn’t anything immediately wrong with it, and it certainly looked welcoming to someone who may have been on an exhausting journey needing a rest, but it was just… off.


“Lucas… how did you find this place again?” Alexander’s cool demeanor was slipping at the seams.


“Um, I just… I don’t know I just came across it while you guys were asleep. I thought maybe it would be an easy camp to chill in for the night.”


“Alright well let’s just pack our shit in and deal with this in the morning. It’s a cabin, someone must’ve stayed here before so it’s gotta be a good shelter.” I might’ve been talking out of my ass, but I was also exhausted beyond belief.


“Okay, just for tonight and then we can always head back tomorrow. We’re not far from camp” Colin said, his eyes shining from the light off the moon.

 

“Hey, Scarlett, wake up, Alexander is gone!”


“What? What do you mean? Where’s Colin?”


“Colin? Whose Colin? Are you okay?”


“Oh, I’m sorry, I thought Colin was here,” I said, groggy from my sleep. I didn’t know a Colin, but must’ve been dreaming or something for that random name to pop out of my mouth. It didn’t raise any concern though, we all had our own friends, and there was something more pressing to deal with at the moment.


“Oh… okay. Alexander is missing. I don’t think he’s playing a joke. I’ve been walking around the cabin for like an hour.”


“Sounds a lot like the boy who cried wolf” I said, shouting the words before my brain could even react.


“What the hell Scar, that’s kind of shitty to say.”


I wasn’t even sure what had come over me in that moment, obviously I loved Alexander, but this was serious, and he was missing. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was just playing another stupid joke, and as insensitive as it was, I decided to take that route when trying to calm down Lucas.


“He’s done this before, it’s not like it’s out of the ordinary.”


“Yeah, maybe, but he could be in trouble. We really should just look around and make sure…


“Okay, fine, but we go together, and we’re bringing our backpacks and we’re not staying out hear longer than an hour without returning to camp.”


“Alright, that’s a good idea. Let’s leave a note, just in case he comes back.”


Colin went to -Lucas went into his bag to grab a pen and paper, wrote out a basic note – WE WENT LOOKING FOR YOU, BE BACK BY 3AM LATEST – and set out on our way.

           

 

“So… who is this Colin guy?”


“He’s no one… don’t worry about it.”


“Hey, Scar,” his genuine emotion was always what got me, it’s not like I didn’t want to be with him, but I just didn’t want to hold him back.


“Scar,” he said, a bit more forcefully this time, “Don’t worry, we’re going to find him.”


“I know, I’m just- I’m just a little sleep deprived and freaked out.”


Lucas nodded at me with understanding, Alexander was a bit crazy but Lucas and I’s responsibility more than accounted for any that he had lacked. We continued on down the same trail for about twenty more minutes before we chose to turn around.


“So, you never told me…” Colin almost whispered, his eyes staying focused on the clearing ahead of us.


“Told you what?”


“Who is Colin? I’m not mad, I’m just, I’m just curious is all.”


“Oh, Colin? He’s he’s nothing. Just some random guy I know from the store, I must’ve been sleep talking or something.”


“You know you can be honest with me Scar, we’ve been friends since we were like-”


Before he could get the next word out of his mouth we both heard a scream, and it sounded a lot like Alex.


“Did you hear that? We need to go right now.”


“Okay, but he could just be playing a joke, let’s not go too crazy.”


“What the fuck are you talking about Scar? He just screamed, we need to move NOW. It wasn’t that far away, let’s GO!”


I’m not sure what came over me to make me so dismissive of our best friend possibly being in danger, I must’ve been tired or something, but once I snapped back into it I jumped into action.

 

 

“Alexander!”


“Hey, Alexander, where are you!?”


My voice was getting horse after only about 10 minutes of calling his name. Still, we were no closer to his whereabouts than we were when he first screamed.


“Luke, what if, what if we can’t find him?”


“…what did you just say?”


“…um, I said what if we can’t find him?”


“…we will. Don’t worry Scar.”


I realized right away he was talking about me calling him Luke, that isn’t his name and he never went by it, he just didn’t get as angry as Alexander did. I figured it was best to play it off in the moment, as I had been so sleep deprived and exhausted by this point it almost didn’t matter. I think Lucas felt the same.


“I think we need to rest, I’ll set up a fire and Alexander will see it if he’s around. If he’s not, we still have time before the sun rises, and I don’t want to be walking around the desert if we don’t know where he is. We’ll just have to continue our search in the morning.”


“Okay, I guess that’s a good idea. Can you, can you just, can you hold me tonight while we sleep? I’m just really scared right now.”


“Of course, Scar, of course.”  Lucas was the only one I let call me Scar, I don’t know what the deal was with all of our hatred of nicknames, but for whatever reason, it never bothered me when Lucas said that.

 

 

I woke up to the sun blinding my face and heavy breathing. I wiped my eyes in a futile attempt to adjust them and wake myself up when I saw a blurry blob right next time me. A blurry blob that looked a lot like Alexander.


“Alexander! Oh my god, Alexander! Wake up!”


“He’s not going to wake up right now, I think he’s in a coma. We need someone to come out here, like, yesterday”.” Lucas said, unzipping the tent as he reentered.


“I got some water for him, I also have the med kit. I think I can probably stitch these wounds up, but no guarantees since I’ve only practiced on animals, haha.”


“Why… why didn’t you wake me up? He’s bleeding all over the place.” I tried to avoid looking but the cuts in his side were gaping.


“He’s fine, relax.”


“Okay, don’t be an asshole Luke-”


Before I could even finish my sentence, his hand was around my throat, applying pressure that couldn’t even be considered as a joke.


“Don’t. Fucking. Call. Me. Luke. I’m Lucas. Cut the shit, you-” he cut off, releasing his grip.


“Oh, oh my god. I’m so sorry Scar I- I don’t even know what just happened, I like, I”


“Okay, LUCAS, just shut up. There’s a lot going on right now, just move on.”


Lucas nodded in understanding approval, still clearly very ashamed at his outburst.


“But,” I said, shooting daggers from my eyes, “If you ever try to touch me like that again, I will use my mace on you and leave you for fucking dead.”


He clearly understood, without so much as a peep, but he was afraid for sure. I was afraid, too, not just of his reaction, but of my sudden violence. It wasn’t uncalled for, but that was not me. And it didn’t feel like me. Something was happening to all of us, and the only thing we could do is hope for a med flight for Alexander.
