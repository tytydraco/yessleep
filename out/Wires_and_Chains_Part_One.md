Hello everyone, this is Glenn Matsuri once again.

I realize I didn’t properly introduce myself the last time, when I shared my account of the Piper. Which you can read here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/8X0s4glHZx For that experience, I wrote everything after the fact, neatly tying together the threads of a story that had already ended. But what I am about to share with you now is different. While it’s all over now, what you’re about to read began as my account in real time, as it happened.

After my confrontation with the cult of Moloch and the strange peace I found in its wake, I couldn’t ignore the truth anymore: the world is not what it seems. I saw firsthand how thin the veil between the ordinary and the extraordinary truly is. I learned how deep and tangled the roots of the unknown could grow.

And once you’ve seen those things, you can’t look away.

That experience changed me. It haunted me, yes, but it also ignited something—a need to understand, to dig deeper, to uncover what else might be hidden in the shadows. So I’ve set out once again, driven by that same curiosity and, perhaps, a need for answers I’ll never truly find.

This story isn’t about the Piper. It’s about something else entirely. Something that lives in the spaces we think we control but never really do.

This is my account of what I’ve found. 

I spent days searching, chasing shadows and whispers, and every lead dissolved into nothing. The world felt smaller than it should, its mysteries shriveling under my scrutiny. Forums buzzed with nonsense. Blogs recycled the same tired tales of hauntings, cryptids, and rituals. Nothing had teeth—nothing was real.

Frustration gnawed at me. Hours spent staring at my screen, poring over meaningless threads. Each dead end fed a creeping doubt: had my experience with the Piper and Moloch been some cruel anomaly? Was I chasing something that no longer wanted to be found?

It was during one of these aimless afternoons, sitting in a coffee shop, that I finally stumbled across something. Or maybe it stumbled across me.

I wasn’t paying attention at first, my focus blurred by caffeine and exhaustion. But out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a girl sitting a few tables away. She had a laptop in front of her, a cup of tea untouched beside it. Nothing unusual, really—at least not at first glance.

But something about her stillness caught my attention. She wasn’t typing or scrolling. Her hands rested flat on the table, her eyes locked on the screen.

I tried to brush it off. People get lost in their devices all the time. But the longer I watched her, the more unsettled I felt. Her face was expressionless, her breathing slow and shallow, as if she wasn’t entirely there.

Instinct took over. I stood, pretending to stretch, and casually moved closer to her table. She didn’t look up, didn’t react at all, her eyes glued to the screen.

The screen.

I tilted my head slightly, catching a glimpse. At first, I thought it was just a website, but the longer I looked, the more wrong it felt. The background was pale, almost white, and the text—if you could call it that—wasn’t in any language I recognized. Jagged, angular symbols scrolled endlessly, shifting in patterns that made my eyes ache.

There was a faint hum, so soft I almost didn’t notice it, pressing at the edges of my hearing. A low, static buzz that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once.

The girl’s hands twitched slightly, her fingers brushing the table. Her breathing hitched for a moment, then steadied again. But she didn’t look away.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine, a deep, instinctual sense of wrongness.

I didn’t stay long. I didn’t confront her or ask questions—I just left, my mind racing.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was nothing. Maybe she was just zoned out, hypnotized by some weird video or obscure internet project. But the feeling stuck with me, that whisper of static at the back of my skull.

And then I started seeing it again.

It wasn’t everywhere, not all the time, but it was enough. A man sitting on a park bench, staring at his phone with that same vacant expression, his screen glowing faintly with the same jagged symbols. A teenager on the subway, their laptop balanced on their knees, their fingers motionless on the keyboard. A woman in a grocery store, standing frozen in the middle of an aisle, her phone dangling loosely in her hand.

Every time, the same stillness. The same hollow gaze. The same faint, suffocating hum that I could feel more than hear.

It wasn’t just my imagination.

Something was happening.

And I had to know what.

The more I saw these people, the more obsessed I became. They weren’t hard to find if I paid attention—those glazed-over stares, the unnerving stillness. But what unsettled me most was that they didn’t completely withdraw from the world.

They still interacted with it, in their way. A man in the park stood up eventually, shuffled to a nearby trash can to throw away a soda can, and then returned to his bench. A teenager on the subway snapped their laptop shut when their stop came and exited with the crowd, moving with a mechanical rhythm. The woman at the grocery store eventually left her aisle and checked out, scanning her items with an eerie precision.

It was like they were running on autopilot, performing the basic functions of life with just enough coherence to pass as normal. But they weren’t normal. I couldn’t explain it, but I felt it—something vital was missing, like their spark had been snuffed out.

Eventually, I decided I couldn’t just watch anymore. I had to talk to one of them.

She was sitting outside a coffee shop, her laptop open on the table, the same glazed look on her face. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, twitching slightly but never pressing a key. I could hear the faint hum again, that static pressure crawling up the back of my skull.

I hesitated, unsure how to approach her. But then I forced myself to take a deep breath and walked over. “Excuse me,” I said, trying to keep my voice light.

She didn’t respond.

I stepped closer. “Hey, are you okay?”

This time, she moved. Slowly, almost reluctantly, her head turned toward me. Her eyes met mine, and I felt a chill run through me. They were blank—no curiosity, no irritation, no recognition. Just a dull, empty gaze.

“I’m fine,” she said, her voice flat and mechanical.

Her answer wasn’t what unsettled me. It was how she said it. There was no inflection, no emotion, like she was reading from a script.

“What are you working on?” I asked, gesturing toward her laptop.

She blinked, her expression not changing. “It’s a project.”

“What kind of project?”

“A personal one.”

Her responses were clipped, vague, like she was deflecting without even trying to. I glanced down at her screen and saw the same strange symbols scrolling across it. My heart pounded in my chest.

“Can I see?” I asked, forcing a casual tone.

“No.”

Her hand moved slightly, shielding the laptop from my view. For the first time, there was something in her tone—an edge of resistance, though it was faint.

“Please,” I pressed. “I just… it looks interesting.”

She hesitated, her gaze flickering back to the screen. Her fingers twitched again, and then, to my surprise, she nodded. “Okay.”

She turned the laptop toward me, and the symbols on the screen seemed to pulse faintly, shifting faster now that I was looking at them. My eyes ached, and the hum grew louder, buzzing in my skull.

“What is this?” I asked.

“A site,” she said simply.

“What’s it called?”

Her lips parted slightly, and for a moment, I thought she wouldn’t answer. But then she said it, her voice barely a whisper: “WireWeave.”

WireWeave. The name felt cold and sharp, like something that didn’t belong in my mouth.

“Where did you find it?” I asked, but she didn’t respond. Her gaze drifted back to the screen, her blank stare returning.

“Hey,” I said, louder this time.

She flinched slightly, as if I’d startled her. Then she turned the laptop away from me, her fingers brushing the keyboard with mechanical precision.

“I have to go,” she said, her voice hollow again.

Before I could say anything else, she closed the laptop, stood up, and walked away, her movements slow but deliberate. I didn’t follow her. My mind was too busy reeling from what I’d just seen and heard.

WireWeave.

Whatever was happening to these people, whatever was pulling them into that hollow, glazed state, it was connected to that site.

And now I had a name.

The room was dark, save for the faint glow of my computer screen. The only sounds were the hum of the fan and the occasional creak of the old wooden desk beneath my elbows. The city outside was quiet, muffled by the hour, leaving me alone with the unsettling silence that always seemed to creep in when I was at my most vulnerable.

The name WireWeave echoed in my mind as I typed it into the search bar. My fingers hesitated over the keys, a faint tremor running through them. I couldn’t explain why, but I felt as though I was about to open a door I couldn’t close.

The first search results were useless. Generic tech blogs, knitting tutorials, even some links to outdated forum posts. Nothing remotely related to what I was looking for. I refined the search, adding terms like “symbols,” “glazed,” “unusual website.” Still nothing.

Frustration mounted as the hours dragged on. I scrolled through endless pages, my eyes burning from the glow of the screen. The silence around me grew heavier, more oppressive, and the faint buzz at the back of my skull—so subtle at first—started to grow louder.

And then I found it.

It wasn’t the site itself, not yet. It was an obscure blog post buried deep in a forgotten corner of the internet. The page was dated years ago, the formatting crude and broken, as though it hadn’t been touched in decades.

The title read: Naamah’s Paradise: A False Eden.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine as I clicked the link.

The post was rambling, fragmented, but one thing was clear: the author claimed to have encountered someone—or something—called Naamah. She was described as a being of extraordinary beauty and malice, offering an escape, a paradise, to those she touched. But it wasn’t real. It was a trap, a cage built from wires and chains, where the mind was ensnared and the soul consumed.

The author warned against searching for her, against following the whispers of her promise. But the post ended with a single, chilling line:

“If you’ve come this far, it’s already too late. You know the name of her paradise. WireWeave.”

My heart pounded in my chest as I scrolled further, and there it was: a link. No description, no explanation, just a simple, blue hyperlink glowing faintly on the screen.

I hesitated. Every instinct screamed at me to stop, to close the tab and walk away. But the buzz in my skull was louder now, insistent, almost alive. It felt like something was pushing me forward, urging me to click.

And I did.

The screen went black for a moment, then loaded into a stark, minimalistic website. The background was pale, almost white, and in the center of the screen was a single line of text:

“Welcome to Paradise.”

Beneath it, symbols began to scroll across the page—jagged, angular, shifting constantly, just as I’d seen before. The hum in my head surged, sharp and relentless, as if the symbols themselves were drilling into my mind.

I couldn’t look away.

My fingers hovered over the keyboard, but I couldn’t type. The cursor blinked steadily in the empty search bar at the top, waiting for input, but my hands refused to move.

The buzz grew louder. It wasn’t just in my head anymore—it was everywhere. In the air, in the walls, vibrating through the floor beneath my feet.

The symbols pulsed, faster now, the screen flickering slightly as though something was trying to break through.

And then, I felt it.

A pull.

It wasn’t physical, not exactly, but it was undeniable. Like an invisible thread tugging at the back of my mind, pulling me closer to the screen. My vision blurred, the symbols on the page stretching and twisting into impossible shapes.

I tried to move, to push the chair back, to tear my eyes away, but my body wouldn’t respond. The buzz in my skull reached a deafening crescendo, and the screen seemed to expand, the pale background bleeding out into the edges of my vision.

I was falling.

The world around me—the desk, the room, the hum of the fan—all dissolved into static.

And then, there was nothing.

The first thing I felt was wet.

Not just damp—wet. Gooey, slick, and clinging to my skin like some horrible second layer. My body was submerged, floating in a thick, viscous liquid that coated every inch of me. The sensation was suffocating, and when I tried to move, I couldn’t. My arms and legs were stuck, my movements sluggish and weak, as if the liquid itself resisted me.

I opened my eyes—or at least, I thought I did. The world around me was blurred, hazy, and strangely pixelated. Shapes shimmered at the edges of my vision, jagged and incomplete, as if they were struggling to take form.

I blinked again, and slowly, the details began to emerge.

I was in a cave. The walls were jagged and dark, dripping with moisture. The air was thick and heavy, with an unsettling, almost metallic tang. Around me, massive clusters of spider eggs clung to the walls and floor, their translucent shells pulsating faintly with an eerie glow.

And then I saw the vat.

I wasn’t just submerged—I was trapped in a large, gooey vat at the center of the cave, surrounded by dozens of others. Most were empty, their viscous contents pooled on the ground, but a few held strange, shadowy forms—figures that seemed human, but flickered and glitched as though struggling to stay solid.

The realization hit me like a punch to the gut. I wasn’t in my apartment anymore.

Panic surged as I thrashed against the substance holding me in place. It was sticky and resistant, like some kind of organic glue, and every movement felt like it was dragging me deeper into its grip. My breath came in short, panicked gasps, and I realized I wasn’t breathing air—it was something else, something thick and wrong.

And then the rendering began.

The cave seemed to ripple, the edges of the walls shimmering as if I were looking at them through heatwaves. Textures slid into place, details sharpening and solidifying. The faint hum I’d heard in my apartment was louder now, vibrating through my body as the world snapped into focus piece by piece.

I wasn’t just in the computer. I was part of it.

I don’t know how long I was stuck there, unable to move, the reality of my situation sinking in like cold water. The eggs around me pulsed, their faint glow growing brighter, casting flickering shadows across the cave walls.

I was on the verge of giving up when I heard footsteps.

They were faint at first, echoing from somewhere beyond the vat. Then they grew louder, more purposeful. A figure emerged from the shadows—a man, tall and broad, with a rough, unkempt beard and sharp eyes that darted around the cave like he was searching for something. He was clad in a mix of leather and what looked like salvaged metal armor, and he carried a rusted sword at his side.

Behind him, a woman followed, her movements graceful and deliberate. Her hair was tied back in a loose braid, and she wore a cloak that shimmered faintly in the dim light. Her eyes locked onto mine as she stepped closer, and I saw a flicker of recognition in her expression.

“Another one,” she said softly.

The man—Gregory, as I would later learn—approached the vat and studied me with a critical eye. “He’s stuck. Looks fresh.”

“Get him out,” the woman—Tianna—replied, her voice calm but insistent.

Gregory grunted, drawing a knife from his belt. He plunged it into the goo, slicing through the sticky substance with practiced precision. I felt the tension around me loosen as the liquid began to drain, spilling onto the ground with a sickening squelch.

“Breathe,” Gregory said as he hauled me out, his grip firm but not rough. “It’ll feel like hell for a minute, but you’ll adjust.”

He wasn’t wrong. The first breath I took felt like fire in my lungs, and I doubled over, coughing and gasping. The air tasted strange, metallic and synthetic, but it was breathable.

“Where—” I croaked, my voice raw. “Where am I?”

Tianna crouched beside me, her gaze steady and unflinching. “Welcome to paradise,” she said, the faintest hint of sarcasm in her voice.

It took time to collect myself, to stand on shaky legs and process what they told me.

“We’re inside it,” Gregory explained, gesturing vaguely to the cave around us. “The website. WireWeave. When you went too deep, it pulled you in. Same thing happened to us.”

“How long—” I started, but Gregory shook his head.

“Don’t ask,” he said. “Time doesn’t work right here. Could’ve been days, could’ve been years.”

I looked at Tianna, hoping for something more concrete, but she only nodded.

“What about our bodies?” I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop myself. “The people I’ve seen—outside. They’re still walking around, still there. How is that possible?”

Tianna frowned, her expression darkening. “The bodies stay behind. They keep moving, keep functioning. But they’re not them anymore. They’re shells. Puppets.”

“Puppets for who?”

“For her,” Tianna said, her voice dropping to a whisper. “Naamah. She takes the soul, the essence, and leaves the rest behind to spread her influence. The more people she takes, the stronger she gets.”

Tianna leaned against the wall, her arms crossed. “And now you’re part of it too. Congratulations.”

The weight of their words settled on me like a stone. I wasn’t just trapped. I was part of something far larger, far darker than I’d ever imagined.

And I had no idea how to escape.

The cave felt alive, and not in a comforting way. Every sound—every drip of moisture, every faint skitter—echoed through the oppressive darkness like a warning. The faint glow from the pulsating eggs scattered across the walls did nothing to ease the tension. If anything, it made the shadows seem darker, shifting and stretching like they had a life of their own.

“Quiet,” Gregory hissed, glancing back at me as he sheathed his blade. “She’ll hear us.”

“She?” I whispered, barely able to make my voice work.

Tianna glanced at me, her face tight. “Mama Webster. The one who keeps this place in order. She doesn’t like intrusions.”

My stomach twisted. “Mama… Webster?”

Gregory nodded grimly. “Giant spider. Biggest thing you’ve ever seen. Smart, too. She patrols the vats, makes sure the new arrivals stay put until it’s time for…” He trailed off, his jaw tightening.

“For what?” I asked, though I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.

“Until she drags them away,” Tianna said, her voice low. “Where she takes them, we don’t know. But they don’t come back.”

I swallowed hard, the sticky residue still clinging to my skin making me feel claustrophobic. “And you were checking the vats? For me?”

“We don’t like leaving people behind,” Gregory said. “Not if we can help it. Most of them…” He paused, grimacing. “Most of them don’t make it out. But every now and then, someone like you pops up. Someone worth saving.”

“Well, don’t thank us yet,” Tianna muttered, glancing around the cave. “We’re still in her nest.”

Gregory motioned for us to follow. “Stay close, move quiet. Don’t look at the eggs too long—they’ll… move if you stare.”

My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to follow, my bare feet squelching against the damp floor. The air was thick and stifling, filled with an unnatural heaviness that made every breath feel like a struggle.

We moved in silence, weaving through the narrow passages between clusters of glowing eggs. The goo on the floor clung to everything, making every step a gamble. The faint hum I’d felt in my skull earlier was still there, growing sharper, like a distant swarm of bees.

“Why does she patrol?” I whispered, unable to shake the feeling that eyes were watching us from the dark.

“She’s a guard,” Tianna said without looking back. “For this place. For Naamah.”

“And Naamah…” My voice faltered. “She controls her?”

“More like uses her,” Gregory said, his voice bitter. “Mama Webster is part of the system, same as us. But she’s different. Bigger. Meaner. And she doesn’t have a problem following orders.”

“Quiet,” Tianna snapped suddenly, holding up a hand.

We froze, my heart pounding in my chest.

Somewhere in the distance, I heard it—a soft, wet skittering sound, like legs dragging through muck. It was faint at first, but it grew louder, closer, echoing off the walls.

“Back,” Gregory mouthed, gesturing to a crevice in the cave wall.

We pressed ourselves into the shadows, the space barely large enough to hold the three of us. My breath caught as the skittering grew deafening, accompanied by a faint clicking sound, rhythmic and sharp.

And then I saw her.

She emerged from the darkness, a massive, hulking shape that barely fit in the tunnel. Her legs were long and spindly, each one coated in the same viscous goo that filled the vats. Her body was bulbous, pulsating faintly with the same glow as the eggs. But it was her face—her eyes—that made my blood run cold.

Eight glossy black orbs dotted her head, but they weren’t lifeless. They darted back and forth, scanning the room with an unnatural intelligence. Her mandibles clicked rhythmically as she dragged her enormous body forward, her legs scraping against the walls.

My chest tightened as I realized she wasn’t just patrolling—she was searching.

“Don’t move,” Tianna whispered, her voice barely audible.

Mama Webster stopped near the vats, her massive head swiveling as she inspected them. One of her legs reached out, tapping the edge of an empty vat with a soft, deliberate motion. The sound echoed in the silence, a rhythmic tap, tap, tap that made my skin crawl.

Gregory’s hand gripped my shoulder, steadying me as I trembled.

The spider paused, her head cocking slightly as if listening. I held my breath, my heart thundering in my chest. She lingered for what felt like an eternity before finally moving on, her massive body disappearing into the shadows with a final, wet scrape.

We stayed frozen for several long moments, the silence around us almost as suffocating as her presence had been.

“She’s gone,” Gregory whispered finally, his voice low and tense. “Let’s move.”

The rest of the escape was a blur of tension and exhaustion. Every shadow felt like her return, every sound a warning of her approach. When we finally emerged into the open air, the sharp coldness hit me like a slap.

I collapsed onto the damp ground, gasping for breath. Gregory and Tianna stood nearby, scanning the horizon for any sign of pursuit.

“Congratulations,” Gregory said dryly, sheathing his knife. “You survived Mama Webster’s nest. That’s more than most can say.”

“But we’re not safe yet,” Tianna said, her voice sharp. “We need to keep moving. She doesn’t leave the cave, but this world has other predators.”

I sat up, the weight of their words sinking in. My mind was spinning, trying to process what I’d just seen, what I’d just survived.

I looked around, and despite everything—the terror of the cave, the impossible reality of this digital prison—I couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the land.

The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a soft, golden light over the forest. Trees towered above us, their leaves swaying gently in the breeze. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the canopy, illuminating the forest floor in patches of warm glow. Birds chirped in the distance, their songs intertwining with the faint rustle of leaves. A river wound its way through the valley below, glimmering like liquid silver in the morning light.

It was hard to believe that something so serene could exist in the same world as the horrors we’d just escaped.

“Keep moving,” Gregory said, his voice breaking through my thoughts. “Don’t let the view distract you. This place may look beautiful, but it’s still a trap.”

Tianna nodded, her eyes scanning the road ahead. “The forest has its own dangers. Keep your guard up.”

We followed a dirt path that wound its way through the trees, the ground soft and damp beneath our boots. The forest felt alive, almost too alive, as if the world itself was watching us.

As we rounded a bend, I spotted three figures walking toward us. Two women and a child.

One of the women caught my eye immediately. She was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Her features were sharp and feline, her ears pointed and covered in soft fur, her pupils slitted like a cat’s. Her tail swayed lazily behind her as she walked. She wore a patchwork cloak over leather armor, her bare feet padding softly on the dirt road.

The other woman looked more human, though her clothing was just as worn and travel-stained. She carried a small pack on her back and a wooden staff in one hand. The child clung to her side, their wide eyes darting between us as we approached.

The feline woman raised a hand in greeting, her lips curling into a sharp smile. “Good morning, travelers,” she said, her voice thick with an accent I couldn’t place. “You look weary. Perhaps you would like to trade?”

I hesitated, glancing at Gregory and Tianna.

“Go ahead,” Tianna whispered, leaning close to me. “They’re NPCs. For lack of a better term.”

“NPCs?” I whispered back.

“Non-player characters,” she said, her voice barely audible. “They’re not like us. They’re part of the system, part of this world. Think of them as… scripted. They’ll follow certain behaviors, say certain things. But they’re not real—not like we are.”

Despite her words, I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were real. The feline woman’s gaze was sharp, intelligent. The child clinging to the human woman looked nervous, uncertain, like they were truly afraid.

“Do you need anything?” the feline woman asked, her head tilting slightly. Her accent was melodic, rolling off her tongue in a way that was both foreign and familiar.

“I…” I began, unsure of what to say.

“We don’t have anything to trade,” Gregory said, stepping forward. His tone was curt, dismissive, but the feline woman didn’t seem offended.

“Pity,” she said, her tail flicking behind her. “Safe travels, then. Watch the road ahead. Not all who walk it are friendly.”

With that, the three of them continued down the path, their footsteps fading into the distance.

“NPCs,” I murmured again, still trying to wrap my head around it. “They seemed… alive.”

“They’re not,” Tianna said, her tone flat. “They’re part of the trap. This world is built to feel real, to keep you here. The NPCs are just another layer of the illusion. Don’t let it fool you.”

But as I watched the child glance back at us one last time before disappearing into the forest, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was wrong.

The road wound deeper into the forest, the sunlight dimming as the canopy thickened overhead. The soft chirping of birds faded, replaced by an eerie stillness that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Every so often, I caught movement in the corner of my eye—a branch swaying without wind, a shadow darting across the path—but when I turned to look, there was nothing there.

We walked in silence, each of us on edge, until the trees parted to reveal a clearing. At its center stood a manor.

It was enormous, a sprawling structure of stone and dark wood that loomed over the surrounding forest. Ivy crept up its walls, and intricate carvings adorned the beams and columns. Despite its grandeur, there was something unsettling about it. The windows, tall and narrow, reflected the forest like dark, watching eyes. The air here was heavy, thick with the smell of damp earth and something faintly metallic.

“Didn’t think we’d be stopping here,” Tianna muttered, her voice tense.

Gregory shrugged. “Figured it’d be worth a try.”

As we approached, something darted across the path ahead of us. It was a squirrel—or at least, it was trying to be. Its movements were jerky and unnatural, its limbs twitching erratically as it climbed a nearby tree.

“What the hell?” I whispered, watching it scamper upward in stuttering bursts. Its fur was patchy, its body almost translucent in places, as if the rendering process hadn’t quite finished.

Tianna grimaced. “Bugged,” she said. “It happens. The system isn’t perfect.”

The squirrel paused on a branch, turning to look at us. Its eyes were flat, black, and far too large for its face. It tilted its head, then let out a high-pitched screech that sounded distorted, as though the sound were coming from a broken speaker.

“Let’s keep moving,” Gregory said, his tone sharp.

We climbed the stone steps to the manor’s front door, an ornate piece of carved wood that looked as though it belonged in a royal palace. Gregory knocked, the sound echoing ominously.

For a long moment, there was no response. Then, the door creaked open, revealing a woman.

She was stunning—easily the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. Her features were delicate, her skin flawless, her hair a cascade of silvery gold that shimmered in the dim light. But what struck me most were her ears. Long and pointed, they swept back elegantly, marking her as something otherworldly.

“Good afternoon,” she said, her voice soft and melodic. “How can I help you?”

Gregory stepped forward. “Is Henry in?”

The woman nodded, her smile warm. “He’s in the study. Please, come in.”

She stepped aside, gesturing for us to enter.

The entry hallway was grand, its high ceilings and polished floors gleaming in the faint light filtering through stained glass windows. The walls were lined with tapestries depicting scenes of battle and celebration, though the figures were subtly wrong—arms too long, faces blurred, poses stiff. A chandelier hung overhead, its crystals casting fractured rainbows across the room.

We stood there, waiting, as the woman disappeared deeper into the house.

“Who’s Henry?” I asked, keeping my voice low.

“Another one of us,” Tianna said. “He’s been here a long time. Decades, maybe. He gave up on escaping a long time ago.”

“What do you mean?”

Gregory leaned against the wall, crossing his arms. “Henry decided if we can’t get out, we might as well make the best of it. Built this place himself, married an NPC, even had kids. The whole happy family package.”

I blinked, struggling to process that. “He married an NPC? Had kids? How does that even work?”

Tianna shrugged. “The system lets you do it. The NPCs respond to him like they’re real. And the kids…” She trailed off, frowning. “They’re not exactly normal, but they’re his. In a way.”

“Despite everything,” Gregory added, “Henry can be counted on. He knows this world better than anyone. If we need help, he’ll give it.”

I glanced around the entry hall, my unease growing. The grandeur of the place didn’t match the twisted world outside. It felt too perfect, too polished, like the system was trying too hard to make it seem real.

The sound of footsteps echoed down the hall, growing louder as someone approached.

“Brace yourself,” Gregory said, his tone neutral. “Henry’s… unique.”

The man who stepped into the room was Henry.

He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a warm, easy smile and an air of confidence that seemed entirely out of place in a world like this. His clothes were immaculate—a finely tailored vest over a crisp shirt—and his hair was neatly combed.

Behind him trailed seven children, all of them eerily well-behaved. They ranged in age from a toddling boy clutching a stuffed rabbit to an elegant young woman who couldn’t have been much younger than me. They filed into the room with perfect poise, their expressions cheerful and welcoming.

“Welcome,” Henry said, his voice deep and friendly. “It’s always a pleasure to see new faces. Please, make yourselves at home.”

He shook Gregory’s hand with an ease that suggested long familiarity. “Good to see you again, Gregory. And Tianna.”

They nodded, polite but stiff. I could see it in their faces—something about this place, about Henry, made them uneasy.

“Thank you for letting us stay,” Gregory said, his tone careful.

Henry waved him off. “Nonsense. You’re always welcome here. Besides, it’s not often we get new guests.”

He turned to me, his smile warm and genuine. “And you must be Glenn. Don’t worry, you’re in good hands now. We’ll take care of you.”

His children chimed in one by one, introducing themselves with practiced ease. Their names were quaint, old-fashioned—Maple, Thistle, Ivy, Ash, Rowan, Fern, and little Alder. The older ones smiled politely, while the younger ones giggled and clung to their father’s legs.

They were… normal. That was the only way to describe them. Perfectly, disarmingly normal.

And that was the unsettling part.

I couldn’t understand why it didn’t bother me, why their normalcy didn’t set my nerves on edge the way it clearly did for Gregory and Tianna. Gregory shifted uncomfortably, his jaw tight, while Tianna’s gaze darted from one child to the next as if she were expecting something to break the illusion.

“We’ll stay for a night,” Gregory said after a long pause. “If it’s not too much trouble.”

“Of course,” Henry said, clapping him on the back. “You’re welcome to stay as long as you like. We have plenty of room, plenty of food. You’re safe here.”

Safe. The word hung in the air like a promise too good to be true.

Henry turned to me, his smile never wavering. “You look like you could use a bath and some fresh clothes, my friend. It’s been a long journey, hasn’t it?”

It was only then that I noticed how filthy I was. My clothes were ragged, stained with mud and the goo from the vat. My skin felt grimy, my hair matted. I must have looked like I’d crawled out of the earth itself.

“I… yeah, I could use that,” I admitted, suddenly self-conscious.

“Maple,” Henry said, turning to his oldest daughter. “Would you help Glenn get settled?”

She stepped forward with a smile that was as warm and disarming as her father’s. Maple was just as beautiful as her mother, her features delicate and flawless. Her long, golden hair shimmered as she moved, and her presence was magnetic.

“Of course,” she said. “Follow me, Glenn.”

The bath was in a grand, tiled room that felt like it belonged in a palace. The tub was enormous, carved from smooth stone, with steaming water that smelled faintly of lavender. Maple moved around the room with an effortless grace, gathering towels and soaps as I stood there, awkward and out of place.

“You’ll feel better after this,” she said, glancing at me with a knowing smile. “It’s amazing how much a bath can change your perspective.”

She handed me a towel, her fingers brushing mine for just a moment longer than necessary. Her eyes lingered on me, and her smile widened.

“How old are you?” I asked, trying to fill the silence.

“Nineteen,” she said, her tone light.

I stared at her, trying to do the math. Nineteen years. Henry had been here long enough to not only give up on escaping but to build a life, to raise a family.

“That’s… incredible,” I said, struggling to find the words.

She laughed softly, a sound that was both innocent and alluring. “It’s just life, Glenn. You’ll see. This world isn’t so bad once you get used to it. There’s beauty here. Comfort.”

She stepped closer, her gaze locking with mine. “It’s not so lonely.”

Her words hit me harder than I expected. I hadn’t realized how isolated I felt until that moment, how much I missed the simple connection of another person. She was beautiful, kind, warm. And for a fleeting moment, I wanted to believe her.

I smiled back, feeling a flicker of something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

That’s when it hit me.

This was the snare. The hook.

Her warmth, her beauty, her kindness—it wasn’t just natural. It was designed, calculated. She wasn’t just offering me comfort; she was offering me exactly what I wanted. What I needed.

I froze, my smile fading as the realization sank in. Her gaze didn’t waver, but I thought I saw something in her eyes—something sharp, almost predatory.

“Maple,” I said carefully, stepping back. “Thank you. I think I can take it from here.”

Her smile stayed, but the warmth in her eyes flickered, replaced by something else. Something cold.

“Of course,” she said, her voice still honey-sweet. “Enjoy your bath.”

She left the room, closing the door behind her with a soft click.

I stood there, staring at the steaming water, the weight of my loneliness pressing down on me. I didn’t know what scared me more—how close I’d come to falling for it, or how much I still wanted to.
