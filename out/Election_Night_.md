I know what you’re thinking…


And I don’t care…


If you came here because you want me to talk about politics, it’s really not that important. I can hear your inner monologue now, “But You’re writing a story about the election.” To that, I can confidently say, that I’m not scared about the election.


No, I worry about “election night.” Election night is different. Ya see, election night is something hosted every 8 years, in certain… households across America. It’s a vote you don’t get to know about. The American public wouldn’t believe it, even if you told the story to your friends, family, girlfriend, boyfriend, or even a spouse. You’re only ever really told about it when the cold winds of fate…. Or maybe just bad luck finds you. 


Like tonight. There is a full moon. Fall is sliding into winter. You’re alone at home and suddenly there is a knock on the door.  


The door opens whether you answer or not. They already know your home. Just don’t panic, they’re not there to harm you. I hear they usually come in pairs, but it’s not unheard of for a group of them to come in. “Men” or what passes as men, help themselves to your home. You can threaten them, stab them, shoot them, or bludgeon them. But they won’t die. 


Oh they’ll bleed. Their bones will break, and they’ll be scared, but they won’t leave. Not yet. I read on another forum that one guy even set his house on fire with them in it. He still had to vote. That’s how important it is. 


Once your initial shock fades, you’re not smart enough to be afraid yet. But you will be. I mean, who’s afraid of unknown men just helping themselves to your kitchen table, maybe a sandwich and a glass of water too. 


Don’t worry, They don’t eat or drink, or that’s what I’m told, it’s really just a precaution for you. Incase the night lingers and you take awhile to vote.


You see, they can’t make you vote… but they can’t leave until you do and they make you feel the same burden. Once they enter, You’ll come close, you’ll threaten them with the police. You may even get a couple rounds off with a shotgun or 9mil. but they’re fast. Their arms are double jointed and longer than you think. You’ll find yourself pulled to them with an absurd strength and held tight to their boney chest, iron muscles holding you firm as their teeth are revealed to warn you. 


God their teeth. They look like jagged, broken pieces of scrap metal growing out of their gums. they won’t kill you, but They can leave one hell of a bite. One guy I met had a missing chunk from his thigh. If they don’t bite you, They’ll restrain you. with duct tape, zip ties, or even belts. There really is no method that seems off limits to them. They just use what they have on hand. They do leave your right hand free. How else are you going to vote? 



Once you’re  secure, another man will enter your home with a briefcase. Cliche? I don’t care. You’re here for my story right? Listen close, I’m trying to tell you something that could happen to you. Like it did to me. 


You’ll sit across from him. He’ll look like an ordinary man. But different. He’s symmetrical. Not in a handsome sort of way… no… he looks, artificial. Like no one has two moles on opposite sides of his face in the exact same spot. Totally identical. No ones smile is like plastic. Rigid, and unchanging, and their Eyes don’t look like that. Like… dolls eyes, that see but don’t. His skin is malleable but almost… too elastic. Each motion seems to want to pull the skin back to their original starting points. 


These things. They’re not human, but they’re something close. I don’t know how else to describe the pit in my stomach seeing something, someone look so… normal, but not. 


You’ll feel it then. The tension as you notice the others more clearly now. They also wear faces. But they’re different from the thing sitting across from you. Bigger, taller, and more noticeably different, you couldn’t believe you mistook them for men. 



But that’s the night playing games with you, changing perspective, the situation not comprehending  the details of intruders, just the fact that they don’t belong. 


Then you’ll be informed of the vote through Plastic Smiles . 


“Hello, Mr. (Omitting for privacy reasons, I don’t want them coming back), thank you for participating on election night. We appreciate the inconvenience we are placing on you, but we assure you that we mean no harm. We will leave, pay for the damages to your home incurred during the night, and any hospital bill and fines that may occur as well. We know your time is valuable and your vote really matters to us. So, as an incentive, we will offer you a tax feee gift of 15,000 dollars for your participation in election night. 


We are warning you, that the vote is to be taken seriously at all times, and that you do not tamper with the vote in anyway. It would disqualify your vote, and the margin of error is too big and too narrow for your missing participation to not affect the outcome. So, are you ready to proceed?” 


I nodded, zip ties already cutting the circulation to my feet and left hand. 


This thing or “Plastic smiles” (as I’m calling it” raised its eye brow and that ever present smile parted as an almost prerecorded chuckle escapes it.

“Alright then, we’ll take that as your consent to proceed with the voting.” 


Unlatching his briefcase, I am slid three sheets of paper and a number 2 pencil. 

“Please fill out the three sheets of paper, voting on each item as you deem fit, please do not abstain from choosing an option, or it may disqualify your vote. Take your time, we have all night.” 


The laugh escapes his plastic smile again. It doesn’t pull me into a state of calm or make me feel relaxed  like I’m not talking with a mannequin and it’s murderous horrors next to it. 



I read the first item and verbally shout, “what the fuck! What is this?”  


Plastic Smiles nods its head slowly. Like it’s trying to comfort me, or show its remorse. 

 
“The vote is important to not just you, but to everyone. It affects everyone. Even people you don’t know. You’re not the first person to balk at it, you won’t be the last. But know, that these events, will happen, you get to vote and really make changes for this country. Make decisions wisely.” 


I reread the first item.

Who suffers a brain hemorrhage? 

1. Your cousin who is stalking a little boy.

2. Your nephew who bullied a kid to suicide.

3. Your father who beats your mother.


After reading it I raged at  plastic smiles, “Wh-what!? None of this is true, they are all good people, my nephew is only 10, m-my cousin is representing foster kids, my parents are happy and my dad would never do that, what the fuck is this!?” 


Plastic smiles just nods his head again, “the higher ups put in more context to the vote this year. After a century of complaints about “impossible choices, and what are you going to do to my family! “

He shakes his hands around his head like he’s in mock distress, they are wooden I notice. They make a distinct tap of wood against themselves as they fold together onto the table. 


“Haha, they figured we would “help” you make the vote more clearer. But if you’re still confused, let me be even clearer. You are choosing tragedies to befall on bad people.” 

Plastic Smiles finished his statement with raised eyebrows, his eyes don’t express, his mouth doesn’t move, but his face seems expectant like he deserves an applause. 


“I don’t believe it. I-I-I… this is a sick joke, you’re messing with Me.” My Brain is breaking trying to make sense of this, but there is doubt in my mind… how often do bad things happen to good people and we wonder why. What if they’re real. Maybe.. this is a chance… to make bad things happen to bad people. I’d be doing the world a favor. Looking back there were moments. Things you “know” you didn’t see, comments you “didn’t” hear, you just couldn’t believe it. A bruise on mom’s wrist, my nephew constantly laughing at his phone, saying, “stupid bitch” as he typed, my cousin… we’re not close, but… his clients are little girls. He represents a lot of little girls. 


Picking up the pencil, I fill in a circle. 


Plastic smiles doesn’t say anything but he nods. I slowly read horrible things, terrible methods of punishment. It’s not just my family, it’s others, world leaders, strangers, all of them bad, and bad things were going to happen to them. I would vote for things to be made right. I wish I could choose all of them. But was told I could only choose one when I went to bubble in the fate of an individual members of an eco terrorist group that poisoned “flint Michigans ”  water supply. Apparently it wasn’t lead killing people, it was a pesticide somewhere in the piping that caused the sickness. 


Before I knew it, I was finished. My last item being on which inmate would be murdered by an even more vicious inmate in a Prison in Angola. 


Plastic smiles took my papers and placed it into the briefcase after inspecting them. 

“We thank you for your participation on election night. We hope the votes are in your favor.” 

I nodded as the brutes cut the zip ties and I was able to massage feeling into my hands and move my feet. 


“Thanks, I… I tried to be fair.” 


Plastic smiles laughed again. Grating, mechanical. “well, that’s refreshing, tonight has been quicker than most I must admit. Usually voters tend to be very hesitant or need incentive to vote.” 


I laughed at that. Thinking of Election Day, barely anyone votes, maybe if they did this, everyone would. We’d have a better tomorrow, or actually change things. Overall, I’m just glad I know my vote mattered finally. 



Then Plastic Smiles said something that froze me, made the blood pop to my stomach, “I just hope people were fair about you too. I actually kinda like you.” 


“What? What do you mean, I wasn’t on the ballot?” 


Plastic smiles almost frowned, “why would you be on your own ballot, no, other people are voting with their ballots, and on theirs, you come up in a couple of categories. Dont you recall names and people reoccurring on yours?” 


I stammered, “y-yeah, but what did I do to be put on the ballot?” I knew, but now I had more concerns, like… who else knew… how many voters know, what does my neighbor know, what does my family know now. 

Who voted for me? How many? Was i the worst of the people in the category, or is my name just flashy enough where on some random item, some asshat bubbled in my name not even caring what I do. 


Plastic Smiles gave a knowing eye wag, and patted my shoulder as he passed by.  his “things” followed behind him. 


“When will the votes be counted?” I nearly shouted. 


“It doesn’t matter,” Plastic smiled said, “if something horrible were to befall you, id say  it was a fair decision.” 


Plastic smiles laugh crawled out of his belly and into my ears as it and its goons dissipated into the rising sun. Election night was over. I would have to live with the consequences of other people’s votes, and they would have to live with mine. Hopefully I’ll take a couple of them with me if I won the vote.


But listen to me. It’s been months and I’m fine. My cousin is dead… news in Angola says that the guy I chose was beaten to death, and a whole bunch of people are dead now. But Nothing bad has happened to me yet, so I think I dodged a bullet. But if around election day in eight years time you get a knock on the door… just do me a favor, don’t vote for me.
