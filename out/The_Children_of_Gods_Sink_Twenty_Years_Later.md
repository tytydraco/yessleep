I'm an investigative journalist for *The Atlantic*. The following is a mock-up of an interview I conducted three years ago that was never green-lit for publication. For a multitude of reasons, some of which I now regret. However, I feel like I need to share it. This isn't something I can sit with alone anymore&mdash;I'm not sure how I've sat with it this long already.

I've changed names and redatched some specifics for privacy, but the core story remains untouched.

I need someone, anyone, to read this. Just in case.

## The Children of God's Sink: What Really Happened?
#### Eighteen children disappeared in a West Virginia town in 2002, and only one returned.

When you drive down main street in Branlow, past the cozy shopfronts and bustling restaurants of a tourist town in the mountains, you'll hit the end and reach a fork in the road. To the left, a street that slowly meanders into quaint, clay-brick neighborhoods. To the right, a steep climb up the hillside to the historical part of town: the Branlow Coal Museum, the Harlan Hotel, and the infamous Winterspar K-12 School.

Winterspar K-12 was first built in 1884. Sat on the side of a mountain, it overlooked the beginnings of Branlow, and taught generation after generation of children in it's three classrooms and one common room. Even when the population grew and newer schools were developed, Winterspar continued on, transitioning from a public to a private institution.

Then, in the spring of 2003, it suddenly shut its doors for good after eighteen of its thirty-one students disappeared across the school year.

Only one student ever returned.

Fortunately, that student agreed to sit down with me for an interview&mdash;their first ever. Hannah Cole, now thirty years old, and her sister, June, met with me in Washington on the twentieth anniversary of her disappearance to recount her experience.

**Me:** Hannah, June, thank you so much for meeting with me. I hope the drive to Washington went well.

**June McMahon-Colley (JMC):** (laughs) Thank you for having us.

**Hannah Colley (HC):** (smiles and nods).

**JMC:** The drive was fine, though is driving 95 ever well?

**Me:** (laughs) You're right. I hope it was, at the very least, bearable. So, I also understand that you, June, will be translating for Hannah today?

**JMC:** Yes.

**Me:** For those unaware, Hannah speaks ASL. That was the original reason why we asked her sister, June, to be present as well, though if I understand, Hannah would have required you to be present regardless?

**JMC:** She would have. Our relationship is...unique, compared to most siblings.

I should note that, for the majority of this interview, Hannah grasped onto June's hand with both of hers unless she was signing. Very rarely did she let go otherwise. She also looked at no one but June, even before our interview officially began or after we concluded. 

**Me:** Unique? Are you able to elaborate on that?

**JMC:** Well...I suppose the best way to put it is that we are bonded in a way that most siblings aren't. I wouldn't say I'm her caretaker, though she does live with me and my family, and I don't know if that will ever change. She can be independent - she works a full-time job, she runs errands alone, she can drive and travel and live how any other individual who speaks ASL can live. But ever since our parents passed in 2014, she has lived with me, and that won't change.

**Me:** Hey, she's living the rent-free life. I'm sure many today are envious of that.

**HC:** (Smiles, begins signing).

**JMC:** (translating) She agrees. She's seen how expensive housing has become, especially in the Philadelphia area. Though she wants to ensure everyone that she isn't a free-loader. (June laughs) She does help out with the kids and helps tend to the house.

From what June and Hannah explained when we first met, they moved from West Virginia to the Philadelphia area after June married her sweetheart from college. June and her husband are alumni from Villanova and settled in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Hannah moved up to live with them after their parents both passed in 2014&mdash;their father first, then their mother two months later, both only in their fifties.

**Me:** So, you both went to Winterspar K-12 growing up. I'm sure it was quite a different school experience than most kids have nowadays. Hannah, could you tell me a bit about your time there, from what you remember?

**HC:** (with June translating here-on-out) I don't remember much, if I'm honest. There were only three classrooms and one big cafeteria room in the middle. The cafeteria is also where we had our PE class.

**Me:** What about friends? Classmates?

**HC:** We were just a bunch of middle-class kids, really. Not rich enough to really claim being private-school, but not poor enough to have to commute thirty minutes to the public school outside town. I did have a few friends, though. One best friend.

**Me:** Who was this best friend?

**HC:** Jake. Or, well, Jacob, I guess. We were inseparable. (Hannah is smiling as she signs) I'm sure June could tell more about us than I can, but I remember always being with him, especially at Winterspar. We were in Mrs. Lovell's class, and she always, always got onto us for talking. We could just never shut up.

**Me:** Was he ever...more than a friend?

**HC:** No! God, no, I never saw him like that. Maybe now, as an adult looking back, I might've had some type of feelings for him, but back then, we were just best friends. Nothing more, and especially nothing less.

**JMC:** He was definitely in love with her. She can refute it all she wants, because she was so young, but we could all see it.

**HC:** June!

Jacob Harless was one of the seventeen children who went missing and never returned. He disappeared a month before Hannah.

**HC:** It was...hard. When he went missing, I didn't believe it at first. I kept thinking "he'll be at school in the morning" over and over, every day. "I'll see him tomorrow for sure. I have to see him tomorrow."

**Me:** But you never did.

**HC:** I never did, correct.

**Me:** What did you think happened to him at first? When you realized he was missing.

**HC:** I don't really know. His parents said that he had gone out back to play with their two dogs in the backyard, and when his mom went to sit on the back porch to watch them, two minutes later, he was gone. The back gate was open. The dogs were gone too, but they turned back up in the woods behind their house later that evening.

**Me:** Were the dogs okay?

**HC:** Yes. Completely healthy, though I think his dad said they were spooked. Very spooked. Kinda like how a dog gets when a bad storm is just about to hit. Restless and wide-eyed. The dogs were never the same, I don't think.

**Me:** How so?

**HC:** I don't know. Just not the same.

**Me:** But there was no sign of Jacob when they found the dogs?

**JMC:** There wasn't. I remember I was out there helping with the search. Jacob was the third kid to go missing, so the town still got together and did town-wide searches. I was part of the group that searched the woods; our entire family was. We'd found the dogs on the other side of the mountain. A good forty-five-minute walk for a ten-year-old kid to do. They were both pacing around a...thicket, I think, but the men nearly tore the thicket entirely out of the ground to find nothing. No clothes, no footprints, no Jacob.

**Me:** What about the other kids that went missing? How did they disappear? What were they doing?

**JMC:** The first one, a fifteen-year-old in my class. Abigail Gibson. She disappeared on her walk home from school only two weeks into the school year. She lived right below main street, so it was odd that she was able to just vanish while walking that main road. 

Abigail Gibson's parents still live in Branlow, in the same house, and have left her bedroom untouched since her disappearance. Abigail was their only child.

**Me:** And the second one...

**JMC:** I think that was Brandon Giles. He was seventeen. I don't exactly remember when he disappeared...he worked at the Hart's grocery store downtown. Wait. Yeah. He was the one who went on a smoke break at work and never returned.

Brandon Giles' mother moved to Missouri to be closer to family after his disappearance. Brandon was the youngest child of five and was set to graduate that school year.

**Me:** Then Jacob was the third one, and then...

**HC:** I was the fourth.

The fourth of eighteen to go missing. At first, I considered not asking Hannah what she was doing when she disappeared, or what she remembered. At first, I intended this interview to be more of a remembrance of those missing. A written memorial of sorts. However, in that moment of Hannah saying she was the fourth, I got the journalistic itch and decided that, with careful treading, I would see how she would respond.

**Me:** Hannah, if I may. Do you remember the day you disappeared?

June immediately looked at Hannah. I found this odd&mdash;June looked at Hannah every time she signed; however, this time, June's turn was quick. Nervous. Excited. Taken-aback. All of the above. I nearly backtracked and apologized, though Hannah didn't look taken aback. Maybe she expected this question. It is the most common one she is asked, I would assume. The indirect way of asking "What happened?"

Having been in the field of journalism&mdash;and investigative journalism at that&mdash;I'd always heard that the case of Hannah Colley was not to be approached. She always turned down every interview. She never spoke of that day. She never spoke of what she remembers about herself, only what she remembers about the other children who disappeared. It became somewhat of a sign of journalistic naivety to even ask "What happened to Hannah Colley?"

I contemplated whether I'd made a critical mistake. 

It was Hannah's neutral expression that told me otherwise.

**HC:** I do.

**JMC:** What?!

June did not translate Hannah's "I do." I assume that was out of shock. However, I could tell Hannah's response by the nod of her head. So she might not have explicitly said "I do," but she did give confirmation.

**JMC:** Hannah, what are you saying? You actually remember?

**HC:** (Begins signing)

**JMC:** No, no, that's not true. You've never said anything about remembering. Every time I've asked, you've always shut down. You have! Don't argue with me.

**HC:** (Continues signing. I can not make out what she is saying as I do not know ASL)

**JMC:** Are you lying right now? For the interview? It's&mdash;it's okay if you are. It can be tempting to, I know. You're lying for it, right? Or have you lied to me all of these years?

**Me:** I didn't mean to&mdash;

**JMC:** Hannah, look at me. Do you actually remember?

**Me:** June, please. I understand if this is a shock, but it is only us three in the room, and you're here to help translate.

It took some time for me to regain control of the room. Clearly, Hannah has never told even her closest family anything about her own disappearance.

**Me:** Like I said, I deeply apologize for bringing this up. Are you both okay to continue with the interview? We can end it now if not, and it will never be published.

**JMC:** I think ending it is the best&mdash;

**HC:** (signs)

**Me:** What did she say?

**JMC:** (In disbelief at first) She...she wants to continue. Hannah, are you sure?

**HC:** Yes.

**Me:** Okay, then, Hannah. June, are you okay to continue? We can have another ASL translator come in if so.

June is silent for a moment.

**JMC:** Yes, I'm okay to continue if Hannah is. Though we can still decide later if we actually want to publish or not, correct?

**Me:** Yes, of course.

**JMC:** Okay.

**Me:** So, Hannah. What do you remember from that day?

Hannah doesn't respond at first. It takes her quite a bit, actually, before she starts responding, though it doesn't appear to be out of hesitance or difficulty remembering. I can't explain it, but sitting there across from her, waiting, the air felt...cold. Unnerving. I've interviewed high-profile murderers and covered various mass-casualty incidents, and that moment of waiting is one of the most unsettling I've ever experienced in work and in life. 

**HC:** I was ten years old, and our home life wasn't the best. Our parents fought a lot. Our dad was not the best man, and our mom sometimes thought of herself before us kids.

**JMC:** Hannah, is that really appropriate to bring up&mdash;

**HC:** I was ten years old and I missed my best friend. So much so that I stopped sleeping well. And that's when it began: the hum.

June stopped translating, and the moment felt...teetering, is the best word I can think of.

**Me:** ...the hum?

**HC:** (nods) Yes, the hum. Every night, in the few hours of sleep I'd get, I'd always dream of this humming sound. A very deep, very calming hum. Like a cat purring, except deeper, and it was everywhere, all around me in the dream. In any dream, really. They were normal dreams that all kids have, I think, like being at school in your underwear or being at home with your family, but the rooms of the house aren't the exact same as they are in real life.

**HC:** I never told anyone of this hum. I don't know why, but something in me told me not to. If I went to tell June or our parents, I'd grow very, incredibly scared. Scared for my life, really. So I stayed quiet.

**Me:** So you heard this hum in your dreams. How does that tie to your disappearance?

**HC:** Because I started hearing the hum when I was awake, too. I think it started in my dreams about a week after Jacob's disappearance, and then I started hearing it when I was awake a month later. Everywhere I went. All the time. There was the hum, not overbearing, but just loud enough to always be noticed. A very calming sound. To my core, it relaxed me.

**HC:** The day of my disappearance, I woke up and the hum was gone. I remember I...*missed* it. I ached to hear it. So before anyone else woke up, I got out of bed, put on shoes, and went to find it.

**Me:** You went to find the hum.

**HC:** Yes. I don't know how, but I just knew where to look for it. I walked out of our house and over the same mountain Jacob's dogs were found at, and kept walking, over another mountain until I came to it. God's Sink.

God's Sink is a geological depression a few miles north of Branlow that the Elkhaven Creek empties into. Thought to have started as a sinkhole into a larger cave system, an underground lake sits at the bottom of God's Sink, and the cave system stretches for tens of miles in all directions from that lake. Geologists have studied it for nearly thirty years.

"It's almost like a mythological phenomenon," Dr. Samuel Tolliver, geological professor and researcher at Penn State, said when I met with him in preparation for this interview. "Cave systems are typically formed through erosion by water. That would make sense for God's Sink, as a sinkhole opened up to a subterranean lake, but when we first explored it back in the early 90s, we found that the water never ventured past the lake. All of the caves in the greater system are dry."

He concluded that the leading theory currently is that there used to be streams that formed the caves, and that the streams have since dried up due to the higher temperatures of the rock in the area. He did not have any further explanation, however.

**Me:** You said that you were pulled to God's Sink by an unknown feeling. What did that feeling feel like?

**HC:** I can't explain it. I suppose it's like...you don't think about moving your arm, you just do it. That's what the feeling was&mdash;not so much an actual feeling, but an instinct.

**Me:** And what did you find at God's Sink?

**HC:** Nothing. Just the woods and mountains and the hole in the ground that led to the caves.

**Me:** You were found on the southern outskirts of town. God's Sink is miles north of town. How did you end up so far away from God's Sink?

**HC:** I jumped into the hole.

**JMC:** You...what?

**HC:** I jumped in. It was calling my name.

**JMC:** It was calling your&mdash;your name? What do you mean? Why didn't you wake me up that morning?

I didn't stop June from taking over the interview from this point forward. I could tell this became a conversation between sisters, though I also believed Hannah might be more forthcoming to her sister than to me. June also stopped translating, though fortunately, I recorded the interview both audio-wise and video-wise. Later on, I had another ASL translator sit and help me translate the remainder of this interview.

**HC:** I couldn't wake you, June. I wouldn't be here now if I did.

**JMC:** What do you *mean*?

**HC:** You were never meant to know about it. Nobody was, but it's been long enough now. I can finally talk about it. That's why I agreed to this interview.

**JMC:** You could've told me, though. Any time. I could've helped you even back then. You would've been safe.

**HC:** No, I wouldn't have. Can I finish?

**JMC:** Han...

**HC:** I jumped into God's Sink. I wanted to&mdash;I needed to. That's all I thought. The fall was higher than it looked from the ground, and I remember it hurt hitting the water, though it was warm water. Dark water. All I could think of was how glad I was that we took swimming lessons growing up, June.

**HC:** The hum was there, too. It was *so loud* in God's Sink. Almost deafeningly. Monumentous. It was all I could hear, all I could think, all I could see. White-noise hum.

**JMC:** Is that why?

**HC:** Yes, that is why I'm deaf now. I think.

I should also note here that Hannah uses hearing aids and is able to hear well enough between those and lip-reading, as June told me briefly before the interview. 

**JMC:** But I still don't understand. Why? What could possibly lead you to wandering off alone and *jumping into a goddamn hole in the ground?*

**HC:** I told you, June. It wanted me to. It was leading me to salvation. It led Jacob to salvation, and Abigail, and Brandon, and all the kids that followed me. It wanted me there, too. It was building itself anew and needed us to help it.

At this point, I won't lie, I was spooked enough not to move. Hannah Colley's face as she spoke, as she spoke of salvation, was eerily calm. Not happy, nor scared. A blank-faced slate without a hint of tension or emotion. Her eyes were alive, though, with a nearly manic look. I'm not sure if it was a good or bad mania.

June, on the other hand, looked white as a ghost. Pale and sick and frantic for answers that she'd been missing for two decades.

**HC:** I remember seeing Jacob. I don't remember how, if there was some sort of sunlight or something. He was with Abigail and Brandon when I finally found the edge of the lake and climbed out. They helped me, dried me off with the softest towels, and gave me new clothes to change into.

**JMC:** (looking faint) That's why you were wearing all yellow when we found you.

**HC:** Yes. Yellow was its favorite color. The other kids were wearing yellow, too, and after I changed, they led me down one of the caves. I do remember there was a *bright* light at the end of that cave, and when we reached it, the cave opened up into another large cavern that reached all the way up to the ground. It was sunlight we were in. There were plants all over the cavern, trees and flowers and shrubbery.

**HC:** That cavern is where I spent the three months I was gone. We lived there. It provided for us, and every time another kid jumped into God's Sink, it told us to go greet them with towels and fresh clothes.

**JMC:** Stop. I'm not feeling well. You're making this up. Why are you making this up?

I agreed with June. I began to not feel well myself, this nausea growing in the pit of my stomach, and I too didn't believe any of it&mdash;it sounded no more than a childish story of survival. But Hannah *was* found wearing yellow clothing, which, when I read the initial missing and discovery reports, shocked her family and the police. Hannah went missing in her red and purple pajamas, and if she grabbed a jacket, it likely would have been her favorite white one with red hearts. Yellow was, interestingly, a color her family said she hated when they were interviewed by the local news after her discovery.

**HC:** I'm not making this up or lying.

**JMC:** Then what is *it*? Why do you keep referring to an it?

**HC:** It is the hum. It is God's Sink. It was waking up. It was creaking itself anew.

**JMC:** You're not making sense!

As she signed, Hannah's hands began to tremble, from what I could see. They were signing faster than before. Even if I could understand ASL, I feel I would have had a hard time keeping up.

**HC:** It needed our help to do so. It'd been dormant for millions of years and didn't know how to exist again, so that's why it needed us. Young minds. Impressionable minds. And that is why it let me go: my mind was young, but it was already tainted with the love and hate I grew up with.

**JMC:** Like our parents fighting?

**HC:** Yes. And my love for Jacob. None of the other kids had really experienced those yet, so they were easier to control.

**JMC:** So it spit you out.

**HC:** Yes. I don't remember how. I remember being with the other kids in the cavern, but I grew very ill. Vomiting, high fever, sleeping so much. I remember being lightheaded and Jacob telling me to go to sleep, rest it off, and then when I woke up, I was down the hill from the shopping center off the highway.

**JMC:** And you were found at the Target there.

**HC:** Yes. I walked up the hill and to the Target.

**JMC:** (crying at this point) I can't...I don't know if you're telling the truth.

**HC:** I am. 

And then Hannah's demeanor shifted. She was no longer emotionless. She turned from June to me, and her face was almost...sad. Eyes dark and big, cheeks blotched the faintest red. Mouth downturned. 

**HC:** I'm also telling the truth when I say that it failed. God's Sink failed. It didn't get the kids fast enough to sustain itself. You can find them there now, in the cavern. They're all at rest.

I blinked.

**Me:** They're there? They're still alive?

I didn't need to know ASL to know her answer.

I ended up immediately calling the Branlow Police Department and gave them the exact location of the cavern, according to Hannah's descriptions of natural landmarks in the area. Thirty miles east of the town, deep in the forest, at the bottom of Morrow's Mountain, far off any road, there was an opening in the ground. It was approximately three hundred feet wide and nearly one hundred feet deep. It was shrouded in such thick foliage that it took teams three days to find.

At the bottom, the skeletal remains of all seventeen missing children were found. Lying in a circle. All holding hands.

I alerted Dr. Tolliver on this discovery as well, mostly for his lifelong research of God's Sink and how that cavern was indeed connected to the vast tunnel system under Branlow, but also in part because I believed he would be able to give some answer as to how those children jumped into God's Sink and ended up so far from it.

"They walked thirty miles in the pitch-black," is all he said. "That's the only way."

Maybe all the children didn't jump into God's Sink like Hannah. Maybe some of them accidentally fell into the cavern at Morrow Mountain. Maybe Hannah was only telling the partial truth; a hum leading them to their demise doesn't sound feasible. There were so many questions still, too, like how was she the only one to survive? How did she get out of that cavern? How did she survive months in the wilderness?

***

That was how much of my article I'd written before I was told to scrap it entirely. The following are my remaining notes:

Hannah and June left the interview with a changed relationship. I felt guilty for being the initiator of that change, because I was, in a way. If I hadn't invited them, Hannah wouldn't have opened up. Or if she did, it wouldn't have been because of me. To me.

Ever since then, however, I've had this uneasy feeling. I can't stop thinking about them. Hannah, the children, God's Sink. What actually happened. 

I can't sleep over it.

A group of geologists ventured into God's Sink and the cavern after the bodies were found. They didn't find much at the cavern besides places where activity had once been: remnants of ash, of deer and rabbit bones, stones and sticks sharpened into tools. There was clear evidence that the children, or at least some of them, continued to live for an indeterminable amount of time. Dr. Tolliver was part of the group, and he recounted to me just how unbelievable it was that there is *evidence* the children survived at all, for however long. The amount of ash found in the soil of old fire pits assumes that they were making fire for months, at the very least. More likely over a year.

What Dr. Tolliver said about their journey into God's Sink, though, still haunts me to this day.

"There was writing all over the walls around the lake. Writing we couldn't decipher," he'd said. "It was a new language entirely. Not any language already spoken, and not any dead language like Latin. And it was everywhere around that lake, written with a mix of charcoal and plant matter and spit. We found DNA evidence of all eighteen children in the paint used."

And, near the end of our call, in a more hushed tone:

"I...heard it, too, when we were down there. A hum. We all did. I can't explain it. But, [REDACTED]...it's followed me home. I still hear it."

Dr. Tolliver committed suicide two weeks after our phone call. All of those who ventured into God's Sink with him did across the six months that followed. None with suicide notes. None with any history of mental illness or suicide ideation.

Hannah Colley still lives to this day. She hasn't done another interview to my knowledge.
