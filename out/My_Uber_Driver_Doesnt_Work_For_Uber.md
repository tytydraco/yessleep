I had just moved out of my mother's house at the ripe age of 20 years old, I moved a few towns over due to where my new job was that I was accepted into. My POS car though didn't exactly like that distance as just as I got all moved into my new house it took a complete crap on me. This was about the worst case of bad luck somebody could get, my car was a 2019 Toyota Camry that I got brand new and almost as soon as I got on that new plot of pavement it turned into a 1600s Tesla. I had a mechanic come check it out and I was dumbfounded as the engine and battery were entirely blown out. With the amount of damage that I could only believe God had caused I wouldn't be able to buy the repairs for my car until I actually went to my job to get the check, now I think you know where this is going.

At this point it's been a few days since my car screwed me over so I needed a ride quick, so I installed and set up an Uber account. After searching the app I found someone who seemed to fit my needs as they were my age, drove a nice and reliable looking vehicle, and had incredible reviews. I thought I saw all I needed so I booked the drive and set up the pickup at a nearby park where I hauled my ass to with my bag.

I waited anxiously on one of the benches near the road on my Uber account, I got a bit freaked out as there were errors popping up everywhere. I was supposed to be at work within the hour and I was afraid my driver would be late. I was about to just sprint to work when a car pulled up in front of me that resembled the description that was on the app. I knew it was my driver as I saw a sticker on the passenger side door that had a number, the same number that was on the profile. Something was off though as I noticed that the windows were heavily tinted at a point where I couldn't see anything at all within the car but the window was rolled down hardly a few inches, "Marcy Williams?" A woman's voice crawled through the gap. "Um yeah, you're just in time." I said. I heard the doors unlock and I instinctively got in the backseat.

I sat in the seat and put my bag beside me as I buckled up, then I looked up and saw the oddest thing. There was a sort of barrier in between the back and front seats, like something you'd see in a limo to give both the driver and the passengers their privacy. I chuckled nervously, "Never seen this in a Sedan before." I said. The car jolted down the street at what felt like 70 miles an hour, I didn't even have time to put my seatbelt on. The car then slowed down as it got to the actual street, "New model." A mind melting voice said to me. It terrified me more than seeing my own death.

The voice sounded like any ordinary text-to-speech text but sounded more human than any kind, the uncanniness shocking me to the core. The other thing that scared me was that the voice I heard at the moment sounded entirely different than the one that greeted me outside of it. I looked at the car handles to find a lock and handle for me to grab, but I found nothing. Anything on any part of the car door you'd normally see wasn't there to be replaced by just a smooth surface. However the window was the worst part, not only could I see absolutely nothing but I stared at a twisted version of myself in the reflection.

Flesh was peeled off of me, my muscle sizzled away, and my skull disintegrated lie dust, my eyes bleeding, all with an ecstasy filled smile like none of it mattered. I shot back in my seat pounded on the limo's backseat shield, "Who the fuck are you?" I shouted as I tried unlocking the seatbelt. Instead of coming off me the seatbelts restricted me like a python but burned me like getting branded, I screamed in pain as the car then stopped. "That won't matter now." The first womanly voice I heard said.

The car melted away and I was left on the fleshly ground with now membrane-like appendages held me down, I looked and saw myself in a concrete space that looked like it was meshed with muscle. "It seems you ordered Uber Eats ." The now disembodied woman's voice stated. Then suddenly a twisted and mangled body with different patches of skin hovered over me with solid black eyes, bulging miscolored veins, and patches of flesh dripping off a woman's face. A pair of mandibles punctured through her skin, the sharp appendages stuck into my throat to make me scream. I felt the life being drained out of me, "Thank you for ordering Uber Eats, we appreciate your life support." The disturbing and twisted "Human" voice spoke as it then went to the woman's voice as I fell back to pass out.

The EMS found me lying in the park a week later, I had to be put on life support for four years. I'm writing still from the ICU with a respirator and a VAD. I'm not too sure how long I'll make it for so I'll give you some advice. Just buy a bike or something, it could save your life.
