It was a beautiful summer day. I decided to try my luck again. So, armed with a CD sample, I went to the record label. I was full of hope. It was in vain, as I was rejected again.

I decided to go to a night club. I felt like having something to drink to forget about the day. So I got there and was seated. I ordered a beer. I watched people dance. People talk.

Suddenly, I saw a man in a suit. He was good looking. He came and politely asked if he could take a seat next to me.

I agreed. I was focusing on my drink and cigarette. I wanted to offer him a cigarette, but he refused.

"Smoking kills!" said the man. "Make sure you give up smoking once you get signed" continued the man.

"What do you mean?" I asked. We were interrupted by the arrival of a famous rock star. The star entered the scene, with his bodyguards and thred young ladies.

The star, whom I knew and listened to approached the man at my table. The star kissed his hand. The man smiled.

I was speechless. The star went to a private lounge and was soon attended by an army of waiters.

"Would you like to be just like him?" the guy asked.

"Sir, are you a music manager?" I asked. The man smiled and spoke in a strange language, one I couldn't understand.

I didn't understand. But I really wanted to be a music star.

I finished my drink. The man asked me to order another one. And another. I noticed he never ordered anything. He never drank or smoked at all.

Two gangsters entered the club. The man told me not to buy any drugs from them.

And sure enough, they tried to sell me some crack. I refused. One of them pulled a knife. The two told me to give them everything I got.

Calmly, the man got on his feet. "What are you looking at?" the thugs asked him.

The thugs started to cough. Their coughing soon turned very violent. One of them puked blood.

They left us, still coughing. They hit the floor, coughing and convulsing. An ambulance was called.

"If you were a famous singer, like you dream of, none of them would ever dare to disturb you again." the man said.

"They rejected me yet again." I replied. I also told him I was seriously thinking about quitting this idea. The man told me I should pursue my dream. He told me the only thing I needed was a little help.

"Can you help me? Do you know someone?" I asked. The man nodded and made eye contact.
"Do you want me to help you get famous?" he asked.

"Y.. Yes!" I replied. His eyes were beautiful beyond words.
"I can turn you into a big star, but you will  need to listen to me, ok?" 

"Yes, sure" I replied.

Suddenly, a doctor from the ambulance came and asked:
"Sir, are you ok? Who are you talking to?" 

I looked at the man, but he was gone. There was no one at the table. The man was gone.

"Come with me, sir!" said the doctor. The man appeared again. I looked at him. He produced, God knows where from, a contract.

"All you ever dreamed of will soon become real. Fame, money, mansions, the girl of your dream..." said the man.

The contract was filled with symbols. I instinctively knew what it was, who it was, and what I needed to do.

The "man" kept eye contact. 

"Holidays around the world, billions screaming your name, power, fame.." 
"Sir!" screamed the doctor and then violently pulled me by my hand.

The man got on his feet, and opened his mouth and I saw black scorpions pouring out of his mouth and he screamed.

The doctor dragged me out of the nightclub. I felt hit. I almost fell to the ground. The doctor helped me and took me to the ambulance.

I noticed my body was covered in scratches. I was bleeding. They rushed me to the hospital.

I slept a lot. I woke up at the hospital. Was it all a dream? Did I just drink too much? Yeah, that must be it... I had too much alcohol, that's all.

But as I convinced myself none of this was real and I just got  very drunk, my eyes saw it on the nearby table. The contract.
