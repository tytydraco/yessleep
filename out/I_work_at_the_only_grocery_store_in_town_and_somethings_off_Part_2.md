Miss Williams would come into the store every week to get her groceries. She was the kind of old lady figure that no matter your background she always reminded you of your grandmother. She was one of the few residents born and raised in town who didn’t move away whenever they got the chance. 

She would always come into the store with her curly white hair, floral dresses that looked more like pajamas and her tiny weiner dog named Ruffles would always come sniff every staff member to make sure they were still doing their jobs properly. (Technically dogs aren't allowed in the store but no one was allowed to say no to Ruffles.) 

She was one of the most loved people in the community and was a celebrity of the town. Which made it all the more heartbreaking and confusing when a group of kids found her lifeless body in the alley behind the chinese restaurant. 

This type of crime is something I never like to talk or hear about. Like I mentioned serial killer and true crime stuff has always freaked me out but since it’s someone I know it’s impossible to ignore. 

The vague description by the radio news anchor left me with a pit in my stomach I cannot stand. The absence of graphic description left my mind to swirl with what possible awful fate she must have endured in her final moments.

“Do you even care?!” I finally heard Chris bark at me after the ringing in my ears subsided. 

“Umm Mis…Miss Williams. She’s uhh she’s” I said, stuttering every word trying my best to make any sort of sense. 

“What on earth are you talking about?” Chris responded, flailing his arms in exasperation. 

Seems in his power trip fueled tirade he completely missed the shocking news we all just heard. I quickly walked towards the customer service desk by the registers and turned up the volume on the radio. 

“…Police are still not saying for certain but there is suspicion that the grizzly murder of 78 year old Kathy Williams may have some connection to the string of killings the area last endured only a year ago. This is Lisa Martel CHQ277 Radio News Netw…” I turned off the radio and silence fell over the store so palpable that I couldn’t even hear the shitty pop song over the loudspeakers anymore.

The silence only broke with the sound of Holly letting go and bursting into hysterical tears. The news of Miss Williams was the final gust of wind that knocked over the paper thin wall she was trying to keep up to protect herself. 

She quickly ran to the back whipping away her tears. 

I looked over at Chris and once he regained his focus we made eye contact and when I gave him a sympathetic look he nodded over to the direction Holly ran off too and I went to see if I could provide any sort of comfort. 

As I fast walked towards the break room I saw Rob back on the floor again. He was walking down the dog food alse with a walk that boarded on skipping. I almost felt bad for a moment knowing he must be ignorant to death of Miss Williams and the terrifying rant on the walls of our bathroom.

Once I got to the break room I saw Holly facing away from me packing her things into a backpack. 

“Hey, are you okay?” I ask pensively.

“I just need to leave, I can’t be here right now” She said, never breaking her thousand mile stare into her open backpack.

I was overcome with a fear I could quite describe. As if by walking out the door of the store I would be letting her walk into the den of a starving lion. 

I have grown up in this town my whole life, I know every pothole on every street and almost every address and who lives there by heart. But for some reason the town seemed different, as if the once welcoming residents and friendly neighborhood had been replaced with a traumatized populace ready to attack any stranger.

“Can I walk you to your car?” I asked  

Holly looked undecided for a moment, I could tell she probably just wanted to be alone so before I could speak and tell her not to worry about it she said.

“Ya, thanks” 

As we were making our way to the front door I saw Rob and some of the other part timers watching the news coverage about Miss Williams on the flat screens in the electronic section. 

While the part timers looked horrified and saddened by the news, Rob with his towering frame looked angry, intensely angry. As if he was going to get revenge on whoever did the crime in a brutal manner. Ever since our little “exchange” on Tuesday I have been completely avoiding him and scared I would possibly get his attention by staring I quickly followed after Holly.

Once we reached Hollys car I opened the door for her and she gave me a polite smile and climbed in. When she closed the door she rolled down the window. 

“Thanks for walking me to my car. I appreciate it.” She said trying her hardest to keep her calm. 

“Anytime, I wouldn’t want anyone walking alone right now, especially someone I cared about” I said with a smile and rush of panic about how cheesy that was. 

She let out a light laugh and gave me the first real smile she had given all day.

“You’re cute.” She said in a way I am still debating was either flirty or friendly. 

I smiled and an awkward silence fell for a few seconds until my curiosity got the best of me.

“Did you know Miss Williams very well?” 

“No not really, I mean she came into the store all the time. She was really friendly but I didn’t know much past that.” She said as her face dropped like a bag of rocks and she began to stare blankly at her steering wheel. 

Right as I opened my mouth to ask what had been bothering her all day she started her ignition and put her car in drive and looks over at me and said.

“Thanks again for walking me, I told my dad I’m coming home early and he’s expecting me so I should go. Text me, my number is on the staff board in the break room.” 

Watching her car leave I saw a figure at the end of the parking lot that made my heart sink even lower to the floor.

Standing about a quarter of a kilometre away looking directly at me was the lanky customer. Still holding his box of garbage bags. 

As Holly's car left the parking lot he stared at me for a few more seconds and turned and walked in the direction of Holly leaving the lot. 

A few hours later when I was on my lunch break Tony walked into the breakroom. I could tell just by the way he walked he was about to rant. 

“That shit took me 2 hours to clean!” He said, slamming his latex gloves on the table. 

“If you're gonna have a mental breakdown why would you use a sharpie? That's just inhumane.” He continued while I wondered if he even knows I’m here. 

“You know what's weirder? I was talking with Holly in the parking lot earlier and…” 

“That is weird” Tony interrupted “Why would she talk to you?” 

“You’re fucking hilarious man” I said sarcastically before continuing.

“That guy was standing at the end of the parking lot just staring at us, like he hadn’t left since he bought his shit.” 

“That is weird, he must be new. I have never seen him before.” Tony replied as he sat down across from me at the table. 

Just as he sat down Rob walked into the break room with a couple of the older full time employees. A couple named Janice and Steven have been with the store since the Mcleans took it over. Both in their late 50s or early 60s (everyone is too scared to ask) they have well past their customer service days but they say they wanna work here till they die. Come to think of it, I don't think I have ever seen them leave. 

Janice was complaining to Rob about how they need to ditch the fancy new cash registers (which were made 3 years after I was born) and go back to the classic manual cash registers. 

The combination of seeing Rob and the terrifying prospect of an elderly lady's complaints made me decide to end my lunch break early. 

As I got up and walked towards the group I noticed Holly’s number on the staff board like she said. After looking over at Tony to see him playing a slot machine game on his phone I quickly put her number down in my phone. 

The rest of my shift was spent wandering the aisles in a Zombie like haze completely distracted by deciding the best way to text her.  

After an embarrassingly long amount of time I decided to go with “Hey it’s Derek, how are you feeling?” 

As I drove home, I turned on the radio and the news was talking about the murder of Miss Willams. I would usually flip over the station but I felt an odd desire to listen to what happened to her. 

“The investigation continues into the murder of local resident Kathy Williams, the residents of her hometown reeling with grief and the gruesome manner of death has now been revealed, listener discretion is advised.” 

I once again reached for the knob but felt a wash of curiosity I couldn’t shake. I slowly moved my hand to the volume and turned it up slightly. 

“Police today have said today the manner of death was a neck fracture that severed Williams brain stem.” 

Maybe that meant she didn’t suffer?

“Police also confirmed they are looking into the possibility of this most recent death being connected with the senior murders that were thought to be concluded just over a year ago, in the area and surrounding towns.” 

I was so focused on the broadcast when I pulled into my garage I nearly jumped out of my skin when my phone buzzed on my console. It was Holly. 

“I’m doing better, thanks for asking! How is your night going?”

Since I had the next 2 days off all I really did was text Holly, we mostly talked as friends and I was beginning to think the romance between us was maybe entirely one sided. Until I received one message from her. 

“Hey, are you busy tonight? I gotta get something off my chest.”  

“Thanks for reaching out by the way” Holly said opening a new packet of cigarettes before putting one in her mouth and lighting it. 

“Not a lot of people in this town to talk to so I’m glad you were able to come out tonight.” She continued after a puff of her freshly lite cigarette. 

As we sat in her car in the parking lot of the only baseball Diamond in town I thought of all the things I have wanted to tell her since I met her. How she made me feel better no matter the circumstances just with a smile or how walking into the store to see her at the register made my heart race a million miles a minute. But as these thoughts swam through my mind all I could get out was.

“Of course, anytime!” 

She smiled and offered me her cigarette. 

“You smoke?” 

I don’t but would she think I was a nerd if I said no? 

“Ya I do” I said, taking the cigarette from her hand just before taking a drag and coughing a lung out almost as soon as it touched my lips. 

She laughed and said, “Do you now?” 

“I.. I do..don’t” I said, still desperate to catch my breath. 

She grabbed the cigarette from my hand. “You’re cute, It’s okay, I have been trying to quit since I started honestly.” 

An awkward silence fell over the cabin of the car but I eventually worked up the courage to ask. 

“You said you had something to get off your chest, do you still wanna talk about it?” 

She looked down at the steering wheel soberly, I could tell she had been avoiding the topic but needed to let it out. 

“It’s my dog, we… we found her dead the other day” she said choking back tears. 

“Oh my god, I’m so sorry that’s terrible! Are you okay?” I said sympathetically. 

“Not really, I’ve had her since I was 8, she was one of my best friends just… just seeing her like that almost killed me” She said not holding back the tears anymore. 

“What happened?” I know it's not the most sympathetic thing to ask in this situation but I couldn’t even register the words in my mind before I spoke them. 

She took almost a minute to collect herself but talking through the tears she said. 

“She… she… was ribbed in half… at first I thought maybe by a car but she was just on the sidewalk! no part of her was eaten or even missing her intestines just laid there! My mom thinks it was an animal but in my heart I just know it wasn’t an animal, it was a sick twisted son of a bitch!” 

I slumped back in my seat. Who would be capable of doing that to a defenceless animal? And for what purpose? For some disgusting game? Or to let out some primal rage? Whatever the reason it sickened me to a point I felt nauseous where I sat. 

My mind raced for something to say but it kept coming up blank. 

“I just knew something was wrong when I got home that night.” She said after a silence that felt like an hour. 

“When was this?” I asked so quietly I wasn’t sure she heard me.

“It must have happened Tuesday night cause we found her Wednesday morning.”  She responded. 

I felt my stomach twist into a knot. First Miss Williams now that, I knew that the nightmare we thought had passed a year ago was coming back and coming with anger. Could I really continue on living in constant fear that some malevolent monster will come out of the shadows and attack me or any of my family? The constant peeking around corners and the panic that strikes through me when someone doesn’t answer a text after a while. 

We talked a little more and I did my best to provide any sort of comfort for her but I was never very good with people crying. 

When she pulled up to my driveway she put the car into park and gave me a dejected look. 

“Are you gonna be okay?” I asked. 

“Ya, my dad said he and his other cop buddies are gonna find whoever did this, they are just delayed because of Miss Williams.” She responded with a sigh. 

“I didn’t know your dad was a cop.” I said surprised. 

“Ya he was actually the head of the senior murders case a year or so back. I remember him pulling his hair out for months and with everything now I can see the stress building in him again.” She said looking blankly out the windshield. 

I wonder if she told him about the weird guy with the graffiti the other day? Does she even know about that? It was in the mens bathroom after all. Maybe I’ll just tell her later I don’t know how much more she could handle tonight. 

After we said our goodnights and I got back inside I texted her again.

“I really enjoyed spending time with you, please let me know if you ever need to talk. I’ll always be here for you.” 

I didn’t receive a response for the rest of the night. That isn’t weird, maybe she isn’t checking her phone, she was pretty upset, she probably just needs some alone time. 

By the afternoon the next day I still hadn’t received a response. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when my phone buzzed next to me. I grabbed it at a speed I didn’t know I was capable of. 

Tony: “You didn’t even kiss her? Pussy.” 

For fuck sake Tony. I can’t remember what I said in response exactly but it definitely had something to do with Tony’s mother. 

The next morning I still hadn’t heard back from Holly and when I got to the store in the morning I saw Chris and Rob in the corner of the registers whispering what seemed like an intense conversation. Chris was opening his arms in exacerbation and Rob just stood there looking blankly into Chris’s eyes with his dead stare. 

When I got into the back office I saw Steven unpacking his lunch from his backpack into the staff fridge. 

“Hey Steven” I said dejectedly. 

“Oh good morning Derek!” Steven responded as infuriatingly upbeat as ever. 

“Another one bites the dust eh!” He said, giving me a nod. 

“What do you mean?” I asked

“Oh you didn’t hear? That makes sense it only happened yesterday, Holly quit.” He said nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders. 

I stood completely still, I couldn’t think, my head was an empty shell with only my beating heart picking up speed breaking the silence in my body. 

“What? Why?” I asked through my heavy breathing. 

“Don’t know, she just called Rob yesterday, no notice or nothing just quit out of the blue.” He said finally finishing packing his stuff and heading for the floor. 

“It’s a shame, she was really sweet, good cashier too. Anyway see you out there!” He added before leaving for the floor. 

I was left alone in the break room. I don’t know why but I knew something was wrong, granted I didn’t know her extremely well but I knew this was not like her. She is going through a lot but to give no notice? And to Rob? She was terrified of Rob. Why would she call him instead of just sending a resignation email? Especially with no notice. 

These questions ran through my mind over and over until my lunch break when I was walking out of the store to go get some food, passing by Rob who didn’t even acknowledge me as he was furiously typing on a phone.

Just as I was wondering what his deal was I got a text.  

Holly: “I’m sorry” 

I texted her back immediately telling her there’s nothing to be sorry about and asking why she quit and if she wanted to meet up again. I didn’t care about looking cool or hiding my feelings anymore. I just needed confirmation that she was okay and I was being completely irrational. 

She never responded. In fact my texts didn’t even send as if she turned her phone off or blocked my number. 

That was the last straw as I left the store and immediately drove to her house. I wasn’t sure what my plan was, if she answered the door and thought I was a creep than whatever at least I know she’s okay and I can rest easy with that fact. 

Driving through the streets at an unreasonable speed I finally pulled up to Holly’s house and saw her car was still in the driveway parked right next to her dads cruiser. I knocked on the door over and over, I rang the doorbell and even shouted her name. I got no response, no one came to the door or even looked out the window. Every blind in the house was closed and all the lights were off. 

I wanted to call the police but what would I tell them? My crush stopped answering my texts? A girl in her 20s quit her dead end job at a grocery store? 

I needed something to tell them, something concrete. So with my entire body screaming at me to stop I reached for the door handle. It was open. 

The creaking of the door opening still plays in my mind as I try to fall asleep and the overwhelming feeling to run has still not left me. 

Despite my heart telling me to leave, my legs stayed firmly planted, only being interrupted by stepping forward into the dark foyer of the house. Down the hallway was a half opened door with the light of a desk lamp illuminating the bottom and sides of the door frame. 

The walk to the door felt like a mile but once I got to the door I cracked it open to find a perfectly intact office with family photos and police portraits on the wall. In the centre of the room was a large wooden desk with papers scattered across it in all directions. Among the manila folders and endless police reports was a letter, sitting on top the pile practically lighting up to draw my attention. 

I picked it up and turned it over and it simply read “FOUND YOU!”. It was the same crude handwriting as the psycho in the bathroom. 

I had to keep my knees from buckling as my shaking hands became so uncontrollable I dropped the note on the floor and booked it for the door. 

When I got to the door I stopped myself, I looked up the stairs and to see the only other light coming from the first door when you reach the top of the stairs. 

 Before I could even talk myself out of it I reached the top of the stairs and put my hand on the door handle. 

Slowly turning that handle I saw a sight I cannot drive out of my mind, the scene looked more like the work of some demon of hell than of any mortal man. 

Holly laid on her bed, arms and legs visibly broken, her face was so bashed she was unrecognizable as the girl I knew. Her father laid at her bedside, blood pooling into an endless lake of some hellish design. His throat had been cut down to the bone. There was blood everywhere, on the walls, on the ceiling, on her dresser everywhere. As if whatever creature did this attacked with so much rage that no human was even capable of. The only thing I didn’t realize till later was the doll, the wooden doll sitting on her dresser was completely clean despite everything surrounding it being covered in blood. 

I stumbled out of the doorway so fast I nearly fell completely down the stairs. I ran as fast as I possibly could back to my car and immediately called the police. 

The rest of the day went by in a blur. All I saw when I closed my eyes was the scene in Holly’s room, talking to police and giving them my story over and over. I began to feel sick with every word I spoke. Getting home that night I knew I needed to leave. My semester started in 3 weeks anyway so I needed to get out. Every time I even looked at the store I felt sick. 

I am writing this now to get some sort of closure. Maybe if I tell the world it will make a little more sense and I’ll be able to move on. It’s been a year since I last went back to my home town and to be honest I don’t think I ever will. Since I left the investigation has hit another stand still. More details have come out and it appears the Doll Killer he’s now called is still at large. But if I’m being completely honest the real reason I am writing this is because I got a letter this morning. “FOUND YOU!”
