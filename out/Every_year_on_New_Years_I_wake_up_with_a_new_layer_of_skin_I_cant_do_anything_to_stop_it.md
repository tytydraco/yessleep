Everyday on New Years I wake up with a whole entire coat of new skin. It isn’t in place of the original skin, rather on top of it. For as long as my family has been in existence, every male has this condition. No doctor we have gone to has ever been able to explain it to us. It starts around the age of five years old, and continues until the day we die. We thought it stopped after death- as that’s the only logical situation possible- but when we had my Great grandfather Jarrod dug up and examined twenty-five years after death, he had twenty-five new layers on top.

My father hasn’t been in public after the thirtieth layer appeared. His face began to look baggy, his stomach started to sag and his legs began to feel frail. He didn’t feel comfortable feeling the eyes watch him as he went on walks, or out to the gym. 

My name is Terry Clyde. I am a twenty-three year old male in the South. Around here, people don’t like “abnormal-looking” folks like me. When it first begun, my mother and I got strange stares. My mother often was handed $10, $20, and even occasionally $100 bills. She began falling into a depression, knowing she couldn’t help her son. She constantly blamed herself for knowing the consequences of having kids with my dad, and still continued with it. When I was thirteen years old, my mother killed herself. She wrote to me telling me how much she loved me, but was so disgusted with my face- not what I was expecting to read- and how she wishes she had a girl so her baby would have been normal, how she couldn’t afford to have another baby because of my doctor bills. I wish my mother didn’t think so poorly of me. I never knew how miserable I made her.

At the age of fourteen, I began to pick my skin. It started off with me peeling small slivers of skin off of each layer, than progressively turned into me peeling off each layer throughout the course of six months. Every night I’d take a shower and soak in my own crimson-colored water. I loved the end results when I had one perfect-looking layer of skin. I only had to peel one day a year, and I was golden- or so I thought. 

The first night I had only one layer of skin, It began to sting. It didn’t stop the entirety of the night, and I didn’t get sleep that night. The following night- as I started to fall asleep- I felt like I had urinated the bed. I turned on my dim lamp on my nightstand next to my bed, and saw a dark puddle lying beneath me. I quickly realized that the puddle of mystery ooze came from me, and that ooze was blooding seeping though my thin layer of skin.

I blacked out.

I didn’t pick again after that. I now have nine layers of skin, along with many many scars underneath eight of the layers. My dad had a “stroke” the night before his sixtieth birthday. I mean, it happens to all of us men. 

The Wendigo’s come the night before our 50th birthday and feed on our skin and flesh. We’ve always spoke of them like it was a normal tradition, and how they must love a crunchy layer of skin. It was not normal, no family has to prepare their young boy to grow unnecessary skin every year. I do miss my dad, but I’m hoping I don’t die before I can give my seven month old son the “skin talk”.
