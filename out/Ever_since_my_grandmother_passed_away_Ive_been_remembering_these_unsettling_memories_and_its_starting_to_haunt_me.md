I don’t like bathrooms. I mean, I’ll use them—I have to—but I don’t like them. Not since I was little. 

My parents were never wealthy, but they did their best to make us happy. We used to travel to this one cheap family water resort every summer. I think the reason it was so affordable, was because the resort was literally in the middle of nowhere. Despite this, that resort made many childhood memories there, most of them are happy memories, especially when my mother would gave us a rare glimpse of her true smile. However, there’s some memories that I can’t quite forget, which still gives me the creeps sometimes. It was there when the first incident happened.

**First incident, what happened at that resort…**

Whenever the bathroom in that cramped hotel room was overcrowded with my mom, dad, and sister fighting to share and use it for their own, I’d sneak down to the hotel lobby. There was always an empty bathroom in the first floor of hotel, no matter how busy the resort became. It was down this long, quiet hallway, past the vending machines and an old ice machine that never worked.

You could tell the bathroom was old, but it was clean. Nothing in the bathroom was broken, except for the one of the lights that was dimmed at the far end of the bathroom. There were three stalls in that bathroom. The last one was always locked. You could never quite see who was in that stall, but I guarantee you that nobody was in there. Something about that stall raised every alarm that I had in my mind, and I feared it with no particular reason why. So, whenever I used that bathroom, I would use the stall closest to the door, always leaving one stall between it.

The bathroom was always dead silent. But sometimes—when I was alone—I swear I could hear breathing. Not just any breathing. Wet, steady, like someone trying not to be noticed. I always thought it was my mind going crazy or something.

There was this one time, after I finished and washed my hands, I turned toward the door and nearly walked into this woman. She looked to be very young, had black hair and pale skin, and appeared to be asian. It wasn’t strange at first, but the more I thought about it, the stranger the situation was. 

First of all, I’d never seen anyone go out of their way to use that bathroom. Second, she was wearing strange clothes. The clothes itself wasn’t unfamiliar, but it was the fact the clothes were out of place for the location of the hotel—which was rural Washington State. That lady was wearing a deep red hanbok, a kind of traditional Korean clothing you’d only wear for special occasions. I recognized the hanbok because my mother had a picture of herself in our house wearing one. She didn’t say anything. Just walked past me like I wasn’t there. I didn’t hear the door open, and I swear on everything, I was alone when I walked in.

Even with these details, I raised no concern except a slight feeling of unsettled-ness when you see something just—weird, you know? It wasn’t until I was walking back to the hotel room, that I realized that the lady went into the *men’s bathroom*.Being so young, all I could remember was I knew something was very wrong after that incident and I knew I shouldn’t ever go back to that place again. When I told my father, he didn’t care, but when I told my mother she gave a frown and this look of defeat, or anger? I can’t quite remember her reaction or what she said, but she did something about it because we never returned back to that resort again.

I never told anyone except my parents. I guess I forgot about it, the way kids do. It didn’t seem real after a while—just a weird memory that clung like cobwebs in the back of my mind— until my grandmother passed away.

**Background about my family**

Before I get into what’s been happening to me, I need to give some background on my family. I’m Korean. My mom and grandmother are first-generation immigrants from North Korea.

Back in the late 1970s, when Kim Il-Sung’s regime was tightening its grip, my grandparents made the impossible decision to escape. They began their escape through the Tumen River during the winter when it was darker and least expected— the soldiers knew nobody was daring enough to escape the river when it was deadliest, or maybe that the river would do their work for them. My grandmother never talked much about what happened on the riverbank. Only that they were so close—she could see the trees on the other side. Then, suddenly, floodlights. Shouting. A gunshot. The only thing she said about my grandfather that day was that he drowned. He drowned in that river.

She and my infant mother made it into China, bribed their way into South Korea, and lived there for eight years. She remarried, and had my Aunt Hye-Ja (who we call Aunt June) They lived in a traditional Korean home until a North Korean spy attacked in the night, killing her second husband. After that, she fled again—this time to America, hoping they’d finally be safe.

My mom eventually met my dad—an ordinary guy with a not-so-great office job but a good heart—and they had me and my sister. They always did their best to make us happy, and always tried to give us opportunities they never had—to give us a better future. My parents never had much, but they gave us everything they could.

As for Aunt June… there’s more to say. But I’ll get to that.

**Incident two, what happened at the Grandmother’s funeral…**

Grandmother’s funeral was held at a small hall connected to the hospital—clean, quiet, and white in that way that makes everything feel colder. A white chrysanthemum wreath framed her portrait, and candles flickered beside a table of offerings: rice, dried fish, fruit, soup, and soju in a tiny glass. The incense never stopped burning.

Mom wore white mourning clothes—loose, ceremonial hanbok—and a ribbon tied to her chest. My sister and Aunt June did the same. We bowed deeply to her spirit at the altar, then stepped aside for guests to do the same. There were tears, of course. Some from me and my sister. From my cousins. From the old church ladies who remembered grandmother from her younger days. But not from my mother, or aunt June. They both didn’t cry. I found it weird because they all must’ve been really close with each other, but they shed no tears for her.

Mother stood next to Grandma’s photo the whole time, straight-backed and silent, like part of the altar itself. She bowed when she needed to. Said thank you when people murmured condolences. But her face was unreadable. Blank.

I didn’t understand until that night.

After the first round of jesa—the ancestral rites—we went to the family room to rest. That’s when I saw Nurse Joy quietly pull my mother aside. She was the live-in nurse who’d stayed with Grandma in her final days. Nurse Joy was Filipino, gentle, and sweet. The kind of person who speaks softly even when she’s scared.

I don’t know what she said to my mother, but whatever it was— it must’ve been terrifying.

When Nurse Joy talked to her, my mother broke. She didn’t collapse. She didn’t scream. She just turned her back and leaned against the wall. And she cried—not the way people cry from sadness. It was sharp, almost panicked. The kind of cry that escapes when something too old to name finally catches up with you.

Nurse Joy tried to comfort her, but Mom pulled away. After a long silence, she looked up and whispered something to Nurse Joy. Then she wiped her face and returned to the altar like nothing happened.

Later, during the funeral, mother approached me and sister, and told us to do our best not to talk to aunt June. And if it was necessary, under no circumstances we were to talk about Grandma’s death.

This was easy enough because Aunt June was probably the most unapproachable person there. Perhaps maybe Aunt June was too sad to be talked to. I didn’t question it. 

Something about seeing Aunt June gave me the creeps. I hadn’t seen her in so long, and it was always because she just so—weird. 

**About Aunt June, and why I think she’s so weird…**

My mother always said Aunt June was a sociopath. She wasn’t evil, but she never really had emotions. For example, when Aunt June’s father died, she quite literally didn’t care. She couldn’t comprehend why mother, or grandmother was so upset when he had already died. Despite this, I guess she still tried. She bought them these beautiful red flowers because if it made them happy, why shouldn’t she get them anyways? She couldn’t understand emotions but she understood that other people had them.

But, there was some really weird things that she did that I could never really piece together why did those things.

For example, Aunt June always wears a ridiculous amount of makeup. In my opinion, she looks fine, pretty even, but she wears so much makeup she looks almost unrecognizable. She also loves wearing wigs, even though she has perfectly fine hair herself. Maybe she was insecure, but she’s a sociopath, why would she care?

Aunt June absolutely hates loud noises. Whenever things became too loud for her, she would stop what she was doing and give this strange action where she would put her finger over her lips and make this low hush sound until the sounds were over. “shhhhhhhhhh” she would say until it stopped. For example, at a celebration they started playing loud music, and it wasn’t until we started hearing this low hushing sound that we realized Aunt June was trying to get us to be quiet the entire time. We had been playing the music for half an hour. I’ve always thought that noise kind of sounded like water running in a sink faucet.

There was this time we were staying at Grandmother’s house. I think my mom and dad became so poor they had to stay there for a while when I was like 4 or 5. I don’t remember much from that age—but this one memory from Aunt June gives me this uneasiness.

I went down to the living room late a night so I could use the bathroom without anyone hearing. But, Aunt June was using that bathroom. She had the door open already, so I saw her when I came down the stairs, and she didn’t notice me.

Aunt June was staring at the mirror, giggling for moments at a time just to stop. She smiled for a moment, just to stop, and smile again. Thinking about it today, I think she was practicing how to smile, and laugh. 

I nearly didn’t recognize her because she had no makeup on, and I only really saw her when she did. I couldn’t stop thinking about her face when she wasn’t smiling, like her face was devoid of any emotion or humanity. I mean of course she was devoid of emotion—she was a sociopath.

When I told my mother the next morning, she gave me that frightened look. She told me that Aunt June didn’t live with my grandmother anymore because she moved out. So then why was she there in the middle of the night?

Mother told me Aunt June only became like this until after she moved to America, but she never really elaborated. All in all, Aunt June never did anything specific, she was just—strange. I think that’s why my mother and aunt never really became that close with each other, and probably why she was never really around our family.

**Incident three, what happened to grandmother this one time.**

Grandmother was a superstitious person. Traditional, and old school. You know what I mean. She used to tell us stories about her time in Korea when mother was working and grandmother was babysitting us. Most of them were stories about her escape, or grandfather.

But there was this time she told us a very unsettling story, which was very unusual. I’ll try remembering it the best I can.

During the time they used to live in south Korea, they lived in this traditional Korean house. In these homes, there’s this heating system called Ondol—it’s where these network of pipes lied beneath the wooden floors, all connected to this fire that would transport the heat of the smoke to the cold floor. It made it ideal to sleep on the floor, something old school Koreans would do all the time.

This was in a winter where Grandmother still took care of my mother when she was younger and she was pregnant carrying Aunt June.

She woke up in the middle of the night, shivering from the cold. The floor heat had died. Before she left her futon, she heard something beneath her, like a creaking noise that would begin and become quiet just to start again. When she had checked the fire, she noticed the flame was still alive. This couldn’t had been possible. 

When she was examining the fire, something caught her attention in her peripheral. She talked about this scary old woman with a red outfit, with her back facing away from her house. She was standing behind the water well, before walking off into the forest.

Grandmother never told us what happened after that, or why she was even relevant in the story. Her message in that story was to always be careful, I think. I don’t think she ever told me what she saw in that water well either. 

I was mourning grandmother, remembering all the things she had done for us, when I remembered this story she told us. In that moment, I realized that there was something in common between my story and the bathroom incident. 

There’s something that’s been going on all my life, and I haven’t really connected the dots at all. From my Aunt June, to what Nurse Joy said, to the bathroom incident, and grandma’s story, I feel like there’s something looming in our family. I’m gonna ask my mother about these incidents later, and see where I get.
