   My father always described my grandfather as a, "*Suspicious Auspicious Man!*" He claimed he was capable of great good and in special cases great evil. My grandmother, bless her heart, always said he was a, "- *person in tune with things greater and lower than himself.*" At least that's what they used to say. I barely knew the guy. Only sat on his lap a few times for photos and holidays.

  
   The other day I found his journal. The first pages were typical. Old math equations probably from college years, and boy I tell ya, that old man could draw. But there was a collection of written rants that left me gripped with fear. I couldn't tell if the guy was having a breakdown when he wrote them or if he was smoking what Moses fucking smoked times ten. It was mind shattering. I'd type up all the rants but in between 10 hour shifts and 6-packs of beer I'm kind of busy. This is the first page.

   *"I was 3 feet tall when I first made a connection to the other side. Black stars with marshmallow clouds. I stared straight at them knowing they had a warning for me. It was a strange feeling having the sky show me the spiritual equivalent of a yield sign. Cause that sure as shit didn't say it was a gonna be a stop.*  
   *The fortunate individuals that see or experience Death see it when they are ready. The lucky ones don't have to feel it at all as the process is instantaneous. But those who get stuck in the elevator of the other side truly see the difference between the planes, for they are bound to the plane the escapees and newcomers must cross.*

   *That is where I was sent.*

   *It was cold. The feeling started at the tips of my soul. There was no body anymore. Only a freezing, numbing feeling that seemed to vacuum up any remnant of the consciousness. A fleeting electrical signal returning to the source. It was so..  ..peaceful.*

   *But it wasn't the source. It was a thief in a reaper's hood. Regretfully, I was spared by their hand. Whatever that thing was.. ..it wasn't allowed to take me yet. I was resilient. Yes, my heart and body would occasionally give. From stress. From fear. A rare congenital disorder would turn into an ability that enabled me to see the other side dozens of times. More than some of my neighbors visit their timeshares.*   
   *The point is that..* 

   *..I made friends.*

   *Many friends. But when you have too many friends. Some get jealous. You see, old souls love to talk to the living. It's the same concept as a young kid visiting an old folk's home. But what happens when young souls are competing for the attention of old souls that are now far more interested in a living breathing one?* 

   *Violence.*  
   *I realized it got out of hand when I started waking up from nightmares with scratches on my back. Scratches I could never make myself. I never told a soul. Things started disappearing even when put in the same spot everyday. Keys. Wallet. Even a toothbrush at one point.*   
   *I got so fucking sick of it..*

   *..so I made a deal.*

   *Not with the Devil. He's overrated. But with a couple of harsh souls. Ones that really know how to kick the others into line. You know how YouTubers and Influencers have followers? And you know how huge fanbases have a shit load of pull in the social sphere of our society?*  
   *Turns out it's the same in the other sides.*   
   *I stood on a soapbox between the worlds of consciousness and shared my story.*   
   *I gave any and all souls the free will and ability to steer and control my vessel.*  
   *I gave in to all abstinence and temptation that was necessary to achieve the power I have attained.*

   *The Devil and God are just a story. I am the reality.* 

   *I remember the first soul I vaporized, he reminded me of my grandfather.*

   *But what was considered to be a power saved for those who need punishment or those who wish to be freed, it eventually became a tool to acquire more power.* 



   *Fear is effective at bending the knee.* 

   *Eventually the legends of Earth called me for favors. Ancient deities that wished to acquire more power for themselves. Greedy old spirits who wish to be selfish with their vessel. No more.* 

   *I alone rule the spirits of this planet and many more like it. With an iron fist I have taken colony after colony of spirit-folk and turned them into mules of power. Vassals for an energy invisible to the humans I share the Earth with. To the mortals of this Earth. I am a normal man. A person you would mistake for an everyday normal individual.*  
   *Perhaps you have passed me in the hallway. Perhaps the souls you do pass in the hallway will one day join me.*

   *In a way.. ..I am everywhere, for all time.*

   *And just like other tired god-kings. I have a craving for the delicacies of the other side. Old souls feel the same. Restless and beaten down. Newcomers are still cheery but they know what they're in for most of the time. But there's one category of soul that is my favorite.*

   *Fresh souls.*

   *God are they special. The confusion. The innocence. They are the only truly unmolded and unknowing spirits, the perfect lost soldiers for a fulfilling regime. I give them purpose. I show them their destiny.*

   *I'd ask them to bend the knee. But I don't even need to. They willingly submit.*

   *They believe I am god. They do not know god does not exist. They think ethereal forces are concrete. They think the crowns of power stay on one head. For now, they will. But they used to exchange owners, and often.*

   *Like I said, spirits get jealous. But I took this crown and wore it on a vessel any spirit could inhabit. So for now, it will stay on my noggin. I remember the first soul who called me god. I was on my way to work during an early summer morning. I made a usual turn and before I could finish it an ambulance sped past me practically gaining air as it did.*  
   *I told my followers to find who they were after. To tell me of their fate. I did not know their fate would be determined in seconds.* 

   *It was like a crack in the atmosphere. A boom so loud it rippled between their world and ours. Yet I was the only one who heard it. And there they were.*

   *My first fresh soul.. ..ready for indoctrination.*

   *I did not hesitate.*"
