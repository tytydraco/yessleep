This is a re writing of a book I wrote in highschool. I'm re writing and posting it to Wattpad first so if you want the most recent chapters first youll have to find them there. The original story took place in 14th century England but I feel a more modern setting is more appropriate for the story so many things have been added and changed to be more modern. Anyway I hope you enjoy this and writing tips and suggestions are very welcomed. 

Chapter 1

     If there's one person who's always been there for me in life, it's been Jack fucking Daniels. There's nothing in my life that makes me happier than coming home from work and unscrewing a fresh one. I know I drink too much, my friends don't let me forget it. All that aside I wouldn't classify myself as an alcoholic, I see it more as keeping myself sane. This town is too goddamn small for all the drama in it. 

     I work at a shitty little antique store selling knick knacks to geriatric women who plan on passing them to their grandchildren thinking a wooden doll or 60 year old vase will help them remember dear ol' grams. Most days there aren't all that bad though, barely anyone under the age of 50 steps through the doors and the chances of them actually buying anything are slim to none. I'm not even sure how we keep that place open, my boss Sophia says God gives her all she needs and it stays open by the will of God. I like to think it's a front for an underground drug operation run by her and her two violently ignorant sons.

     I sit in my one bedroom apartment assessing the mess of it I made last night. Man I really know how to party, even if it is by myself. I find drinking on my own always ends crazier than any party I've ever been to. 

     Empty whiskey bottles and pizza boxes scattered all over the floor. All my curtains have found their way off the rods , the rods are bent to shit anyway. The room smells of stale smoke and grease. I reach over to my night stand and grab a cigarette and my zippo. I flick the zippo open and strike the flint, lifting it to the cigarette pressed between my lips. 

     "Ahhh shit" I groan after a long drag. I stand up and head for the bathroom, time for another day in Sophia's dust palace. 

     I turn on the sink and look in the mirror, I look like shit. My hair is a mess of brown vines and my grey eyes are dark and sunken. I run my finger down a split in my lip from one of my excapades down at Paddy's Pub. It still stings but you should really see the other guy, one ugly motherfucker. I consider shaving my patchy beard but I'm already gonna be late, not that it would really matter. I shove some water in my face and turn off the sink. I toss my half smoked cigarette into the toilet and grab my stick of deodorant. I rub it on stepping out the bathroom door. 

      I toss the deodorant stick onto the recliner and grab the stained Nirvana tee shirt draped over the armrest. I shove it over my shoulders and slip on some shoes, I slept in these jeans but fuck it I don't care to bother. I throw on a black denim jacket and find my keys in the pocket.

     Stepping out my apartment door I'm greeted by my neighbor. Mrs Ambrose is a sweet old woman, she's old school but she's sweet. She's calling one of her many cats that seemed to have made their way out into the hallway. 

     "That damn cat I just can't keep him in" she says frustrated.

     "Have you tried keeping the door shut?" I smirk.

     "You know I'll just have to try that" she giggles. "How are you today honey" she says somberly. 

     "Another day in paradise" I say with a smile stepping past her down the hallway.

     "Oh I'm making banana bread" she says excitedly as I made my way down the hall.

     "Save me a loaf will ya?" I look back to tell her but she's already closed her door. Heading down the stairs I see her car perched on the wooden railing. I reach to pet it and it nuzzles itself into my hand. "Hey buddy" I say affectionately. Id never get my own cat but they can be sweet little shits. 

     The drive to the antique store is short but monotonous. It's right in the middle of town next to a pharmacy and across from my happy place, the liquor store. My town doesn't have much but it does have the essentials. There's a gas station not far from my apartment building. I considered stopping in for a honey bun and an energy drink but I don't feel like going in. 

     I pull into the public parking lot across the street down the road from the antique shop. Parking my beat up Buick next to a lifted black truck. Fucking great the Tonies are here. 

     Tony is Sophia's younger son and he's a piece of work. He seems to think he walks on holy ground and always has his next big idea to make the antique shop work. His wife Toni, is a trailer park princess born and bred. I've seen that woman crush 3 tallboys in the back of that truck while nursing their baby. I can respect the lack of fucks given but no child deserves her as a mother. 

     As I walk up to the doors of the store I'm hit in the chest by a steel door handle. I put my hand up so it doesn't smack me in the face and see a red faced Toni storming out. 

     "Fuck you mommas boy!" She screams back at her darling husband. 

     "Ah fuck her" I hear Tony grumble as I step through the door. 

     "Thomas there you are" Sophia says jovially from behind the counter 

     "Yeah sorry car wouldn't start" I spit out the same excuse shes heard for 8 years straight now. 

     "Yeah it helps if you put the key in it before you're late" Tony spits at me.

     "Shut up Tony he's obviously had a hard day" Sophia tries to help but seems more like a jab than anything. 

     "Thanks Soph" I say sarcastically stepping past her burling son and behind the counter to greet her . 

      "I'm sorry hon" she says as I lean in and she kisses my cheeks. "But would it kill you to shower?" She says as she licks her thumb and rubs it under my left eye. 

     "You know it just might" I joke, Tony didn't seem to find it funny. 

     "You know Tom you might find yourself a lady if you clean up your shit" Tony snickers.

     "Why do that? Your lady seems to like me" I spit and hold in a laugh when I see his face. Whenever he gets mad he turns into a ripe tomato only obscured by the squirrel living under his nose.

     "Anyway what'd he do to piss her off this time?" I turn to Sophia as I ask. She shrugs and Tony chimes in.

     "She wants to sell CBD at the store" he says.

     "Im not selling drugs in your father's store!" Sophia shouts.

     "It's not drugs ma it's just for comfort and pain relief and shit" he tried to justify it to her but once Sophie's mind is made up it's set in stone, it's probobally the only reason I still have a job. Tony's been tryinna get me out of here for years, he doesn't like me because I don't like him. He seems to think he's Jesus Christ resurrected and everyone should worship the ground he walks on. His charm works on his mother and his wife but not much anyone else. 

     "I won't hear any more of it!" Sophia huffs as all 5 feet of her stand and shuffles into the back room. 

     "Wait I don't get it if you agree about the CBD stuff why is Toni pissed at you?" I ask. I don't really care just curious how he fucked up this time.

     "Well she started getting all huffy with ma and  I can't have that shit, told her to go sit in the truck" he says defeatedly.

     "Oh shit I think she's keying it" I say leaning pretending to look toward the parking lot. She wasn't but he will storm out thinking it's true because he's as gullible as a toddler. 

     "Are you fuckin kidding me!" He says storming out the door. 

     "Like fuckin clockwork" I giggle turning toward the back room.

     I see Sophie sitting at the old wooden desk running her finger along the book she keeps for finances. 

     "We'll make it, we'll make it" she reassures herself. 

     "Hey I'm gonna step out back for a smoke real quick" I tell her turning toward the back door.

     "You just got here" she argues. 

     "Don't worry the china will be here when I get back" I say as I keep walking back. 

     "You better dust the Hummels when you get back" she shouts as I open the door. No amount of dusting is gonna make any sane person wanna buy those things. 

     I finish my cigarette and flick it into the bucket next to the door stepping back inside. Sophie's back up front now seemingly collecting her things. Her curly grey hair shaking as she digs through her oversized purse.

     "Alright I'm done here honey don't forget to do count I need to go to the bank tomorrow" she says to me shoving her notebook into her bag.

     "Don't worry about it I've got it all covered" I reassure her as she walks toward the door.

     "And you better dust them damn Hummels" she shouts back as she opens the door.

     "1....2.....3...... And she's gone" I say happily reaching under the counter into an old vase I've hidden a bag of weed in. 

     This job may be dead end but I'll never find anything easier than this. I sit in a old stool next to the back door smoking a joint. The sweet sounds of smashing pumpkins playing off my phone speaker. I take a drag off the doob and hear the bell on the front door jingle.

     "Shit" I say under my breath butting the joint on the doorframe and shove it into my pocket. I stand to see a woman, a younger woman, probobally around my age but way out of my league. She's dressed well, a blue dress with white splotches and a green shawl thrown over her shoulders. The blue of her eyes glimmer as she looks around the shop. A silver necklace hangs around her neck shining against her fair skin. Her golden brown hair shines from the light above as she steps toward the counter.

     "What can I do for ya?" I say trying to flatten my hair without her noticing. 

     "Hi! Umm I'm looking for a vase for my grandmother? She says questioningly. I motion toward the right where our vases are shelved. 

     "Right over there" I say helpfully. "I've got a few more in the back that wouldn't fit on the shelf" I offer as she steps toward the shelving looking it up and down.

     "Umm do you have anything blue? She loves blue" she asks turning toward me. 

     "Umm I just might" I say. The only blue vase in the shop is my trusty hiding place but fuck it she seems sweet and I can always find another vase. I reach down to grab the vase, it's a pretty blue with two golden rings, one running around the center and one on the neck. I pull it up to the counter and her eyes light up. 

     "Oh that looks perfect" she says clasping her hands in front of her. 

     "Yeah well it does have a chip near the top so I can give you a good deal on it" I say motioning toward a cracked crevice on the lip.

    "Oh how much?" She asks 

    "Well my boss would kill me if I gave it to you for less than 50 sooooo, 40?" I laugh. She reaches into her purse and pulls out three 20 dollar bills. 

     "Here, keep the change and make your boss happy" she giggles. 

     "Well thank you, want me to bubble wrap it for ya?" I ask picking up the vase. 

     "Nahh screw it I'm just gonna shove it in a box until I can bring it to her anyway" she says with a smirk. 

     "Well okay then" I smile handing her the vase. She holds it to her chest and smiles while turning toward the door. "Have a good one" I say picking up the money she left on the counter. 

     "Thank you so much!" She shouts back shouldering the door. 

     I turn back to my spot "where was I" I say to myself reaching into my pocket.

     The rest of the day went as standard, an older woman came in around six o'clock looked around and scoffed at the price of the 30 dollar picture frame she didn't buy. I lock up the store and start heading down the road. I decided to head down the road toward Paddy's. Fuck it I deserve some fun I was good today, even dusted those damn Hummels. Paddy's is just a bit further down the road than where I parked and my town is small enough I can just walk home and get my car tomorrow after work. 

     Paddy's is one of the oldest buildings in town, some old pictures even have those western style saloon doors. I pull open the door and step inside.

     "Aw Jesus here's trouble" Pete's the bartender and my best friend. No that's not another self loathing drunk joke, no he really is my only friend. We met as kids so long ago I can't even remember it. He's one of the only people I get along with. He's already got a glass in his hand pouring whiskey over the ice. "How ya been man been a while?" he asks as I sit down across from him.

     "Oh you know, same old shit" I say as he hands me my usual whiskey and coke. I look around the bar and see my fellow degenerates and reprobates. It's only eight and it's Tuesday so it's unexpectedly busy. "What are you running a Tuesday special or something?" I ask Pete as he polishes a glass. 

     "Yeah Marco started this chicken taco Tuesday thing people seem to love em" he says

     "No shit they're still letting him cook? Didn't he give half the police force salmonella once?" I crack a joke loud enough for Marco to hear from the kitchen behind the bar. A little too loud as a woman a few stools down spits out her taco into a napkin.

     "Fuck you Tommy" I hear Marco through the window between the bar and the kitchen. I chug down my first drink and slide the empty glass across the counter.

     "Calm down there Tom we don't need a repeat of last week" he laughs at me. 

     "Shut up that pole had it coming" I joke and we laughed for a moment. "Take a shot with me I'll pay for it I promise" I giggle. 

     "Oh like you'll pay for the eight hundred dollar tab you've got built up?" He chuckles but I know he's partly serious. Yet still he pours the shots.

     A few hours flew by and before I knew it I was helping Pete roll drunk old men out of the bar. 

     "Alright you too" he says motioning toward the door. 

     "Aw c'mon man gimme one more for the road" I plead. I'm already trashed but one more never hurts. 

     "You can have one shot then you gotta go" he says locking the front door. He steps back behind the bar and I sit across from him. He slides me an empty shot glass and a bottle of cheap whisky. "One" he says sternly. I look at him like a worried child and slowly lift the bottle to my mouth.

     "Don't you fucking dare" he laughs at me. I lift the bottle above my mouth and in my drunken attempt at a joke I accidentally pour whiskey right in my eye.

     "Aw fuck! Shit that hurts!" I shout rubbing my eye and Pete absolutely loses it. His face turns red and starts laughing his ass off and takes the bottle from me.

     "Yeah your done" he says still laughing. "Go on get out of here" 

     "You comin'?" I ask. 

     "Nah I got some shit to take care of before heading out, but stop by my place sometime soon the kids miss ya" he says turning around toward the cash register. 

     "Yeah maybe, see you later" I shout opening the back door.

     As I step down onto the concrete stoop my foot meets something that isn't concrete. Its too dark to see what it is but in my drunken stupor it slides from under my foot making me fall smashing my back into the concrete corner.

     "Aw shit the fuck was that?" It sounded like glass or ceramic when it hit the ground. The alley is dark with a bit of street light shining through but barely enough to see. Once I get back to my feet I reach down and grab whatever I tripped on. It can't be. It's a broken vase, my vase. No I sold that to that woman to give to her grandmother why's it smashed in the back alley of Paddy's? Soon after I realized it was much worse than a broken vase. 

     Slumped face down next to the dumpster I saw the woman. Blood pooled around her, it was everywhere. 

     "Oh my God" I gasped stepping toward the woman. Suddenly I could hear whistling coming from the street. A dark figure rounded the corner out of the alley and onto the street whistling a somber tune. "What the fuck!" I screamed. I turned back to the woman dropping to my knees. I turned her over to see if she was somehow still alive, no such luck. Her face was horribly beaten and her silver necklace stolen. Her blue eyes still open, she looks afraid. She was stabbed, stabbed a lot. Her head is barely held on by her neck it seems like that sick fuck nearly decapitated her. Her neck had nearly no recognisable skin. Stabbed, slashed and mutilated. She has several stab marks on her chest and stomach as well. What kind of sick fuck does this. 

     "Shit shit shit!" I mumble. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel. Fear? Sadness? Anger? I can't collect my thoughts I don't know what to do. I start hyperventilating leaning against the blood covered dumpster holding her lifeless head in my lap. "Pete! Pete!" I scream. "Someone fucking help me!"
