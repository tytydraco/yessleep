It was a Tuesday after a long day of work. I almost got fired for a mistake that I didn’t even cause or provoked. I had to break up a fight between customers that was started by a coworker that ended getting me a black eye. And last  but definitely not my wallet was stolen, and when I found it, half of my money was stolen.

When I went home, I fed my dogs some of my chicken, and immediately jumped in bed and fell asleep almost instantly, until all of a sudden I’m awoken by a ring on my phone. It was exactly 3 am, and there was no number on the phone. When I picked up, I heard a blood curling scream from a women, with the following sound of a loud pop, before the phone hang up.

I thought this was some sick prank by some teenager slugs who have nothing to do with their lives except to do ruin peoples day, until the following hours. I turned on the news, and fear struck me like a shotgun. “A  Women was pronounced dead by a gunshot wound to the head”. I almost vomited. I started runnings laps around my kitchen. I managed to calm myself down, and didn’t call the police in the fear of the person killing me and my dog next.

I didn’t go to work that day. I been laying down in my dog eating a half cooked meal and water thats been on my desk for 2 days. I went to the couch to want my favorite tv, until my eyes gave in and started to shut down. I went into a deep slumber until I’m startled by another phone call at 3 am. 

This time, it was a man gagging, before it goes completely silent. After 10 seconds of silence, a women enters the room and a second later lets off a scream before the phone hangs up.

I grab my dog and go upstairs to my bed. I lock all doors and close the curtains on all windows. 3 hours later, I go to the news. I got what I was expecting. “A mother found her 22 year old son dead on the floor from a Heroin overdose”. This confirms it. It wasn’t a murderer choosing me as a victim or a sick prank, I am being haunted by a some sort of evil.

The next day at 3 am the phone rings. It’s not a scream or a gag or a gasp or a noise. It’s a car driving. It can be heard driving for a minute before a big noise can be heard and the phone hangs up right after that. I waited for the news to broadcast it. And sure enough, “Just this morning a drunk driver crashes with another vehicle. There is 4 dead at the scene while 3 others are rushed to the hospital”. 

This continued on for the following week. I am mortally terrified. I isolated myself from the outside in fear one day I’ll be one of those calls from death. Each day hiding from the ringing, but scared to decline the option of ignoring the calls. I got a ring on the phone, but it wasn’t at 3 am but instead at 2. It was my boss. I have been fired, but how can I be worried not having a crappy job when I get calls from people dying each day.

As he woke me up at 2 am, I was waiting for the clock to turn to 3 am 5 more minutes until 3 am. I witnessed so much causes of deaths, whether it was a murder or an overdose or accidental deaths, I practically heard it all. Instead, I heard something I’ve never heard before. Silence.

There was no ring at 3 am. There was something wrong. I grab a crowbar lying on the ground and carry my dog to my bed. I lock the bedroom door before barricading the windows. My dog is started to cry and shake. My heart beat is louder than the ring of my phone and I want to hide under my bedsheets,I knew something was about to happen. 

I get a call, I expected it to be the worst, but it’s from my coworker. He sounded angry , he said I called him to prank him in the middle of the night. I was confused, as I put down my crowbar and began to question it. He tells me “You called me at 3 am knowing I have work tomorrow just to scream at me!” I told him to elaborate further. He thought I was messing with him until he heard my confused tone of voice. He then asks me words that shook me to the core “ Your saying it wasn’t you who called me at 3 am am with your same exact voice screaming before something heavy drops to the floor with random loud barking that later goes silent”.

I drop the phone. My dog begins to bark. The whole house begins to shake. I get one last phone call. I look to see what it is, and it’s my own number. I let out a scream in fear as my dog nervously barks. After 30 minutes, nothing happened/

However, it is soon going to be 6 am, which is the time every death was broadcasted. I have 3 hours before the usual time the news announces the deaths.

I have since left the house with my dog and is going to a brothers house. I am at a Waffle House typing this, 3 hours.
