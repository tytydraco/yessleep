**Feed in his name and rejoice.** 

That's at least what google translate said that phrase was when I looked it up after the compound I had discovered today. The one I had escaped from. In order to share my findings, in hopes that someone saves this before it gets taken down, I am posting here. For everyone who knows me and have been worried sick about my disappearance I suggest forgetting about me and expose the greater truth. 

Yesterday, I had gotten a new case. One that was really unsurprising. As a PI I had gotten used to the worst side of humanity. Theft, Murder, Domestic Abuse, Child Abuse, Sexual Abuse, etc. I even worked on a missing persons case that was a victim to Richard Ramirez when I lived in California. This case seemed tamer than others I had worked on in the past. A woman's homeless brother had gone missing.

  
She said, and I quote, "I couldn't find his new address since he switched bridges". Apparently, the homeless had their own sort of address system so when they got drugs or dealt drugs, they would say an address only they would know. To keep cops confused when listening through a rat. She continued to say that the bridge he was staying at was 8th Under, and she had already checked 3rd and 5th. 

  
I asked the simple questions. Was he doing drugs, involved with a gang, want to lose contact with you for any reason. None of that she said. "He's a good guy who just went bankrupt after his business failed. I offered him a room, but he wouldn't take it." She gave me more information, nothing worthy to discuss, and I started looking into his background. He was interesting. 

Top of his class, in high school at least, he never went into college and instead he tried his hand at entrepreneurship. A window cleaning service, bakery, paper manufacturing, and even an old folks home just to name a few. Hiring his "skill" as it went on with no success. It ended with a startup hospital went put him out for good. He had been homeless for only three months with most of his time spent at 8th Under. I had gone to 8th Under before because another homeless person went missing two months ago. 

As I drove through town with the mostly smog covered sky above me, I went again to 8th Under and a beggar who I had spoken to last time was still there. Ragged clothes for the winter, empty bottles sprawled along the ground in remnant of his indulgence, and a shopping cart filled with trash. The bridge was barley standing, time has caused it to become unstable but with lack of funding no one has repaired it. "Any change for a poor soul sir?" I gave him a dollar, and he raised his head. "Why sir it's you, I remember you!" He spoke with gravel in his throat but as angelic and proud as a preacher. "Why are you here?" 

"Another missing person Rico."

"So? People go missing every day. Just as people die every day. Just as the sun rises and falls every day. And just as people who find their place are labeled as lost." I pondered the last sentence and grabbed a photo of the brother to show him. "That photo won't do no good. He had already transcended. The transformation started and now has passed."

"What do you mean?" At this question, he laughed softly and began to rant. Whether it was alcohol or the truth I still don't know. Even with the events that have occurred, I feel like only half of what he said had any significance. 

"I mean to be a bridge, like this one, but instead of cars I mean to pass a spark of ignition to the mind. I mean to decide the start and end. I mean to ferry those who ask, and I mean to collect no toll. I mean to build a staircase to heaven and lock all out with exception to those of my choosing. I mean..." 

"I mean to have you point me in the direction of this man for a twenty." I interrupted him, showing the photo of the brother in one hand, and in the other a twenty. He took it without hesitation and rummaged through his shopping cart. He pulled out a photo of an old campground. Unnamed and unfamiliar. Before I could ask him more, what I assumed was his son had brought more alcohol. As I left lighting a cigarette, he continued to rant to the child as they shared a bottle. 

I looked up all the nearby campgrounds, none matched. I ended up going to the library on the edge of the city to look up old records that perhaps may have not been transcribed to the internet. Upon arriving, I watched two men jump an old woman. I watched from my car as they preceded to rip away her purse and threw her to the ground. A man with a dog walking by witnessed it, just as me, and continued walking. He got angry at his dog who was barking at the two men who were now running away with her purse, necklace, and high heels. I lit a cigarette, watched as the woman stumbled away, and I entered the library. 

Inside, I began going through records of old campgrounds smoking as I did. This made the Libarian angry, and he almost said a word but did nothing. As I searched, I found the exact photo and a another of its demolishment for an outdoor retail store. A loud crash outside had caught my attention.

Rushing to the window I could see the back of my car totaled and the front another smashed. I put my cigarette out and went to talk with the idiot who had ran into my parked car. To my surprise it was a cop, and he ended up turning off his body cam and gave me a ticket for reckless driving. People walked by ignoring the crash. I started my car and attempted to drive to the store. 

About halfway my back tires gave out, not being able to afford a mechanic I continued on foot. Finally making it to the store, I light up and noticed another beggar with a sign that read, please adopt and give her a home. It was a mother giving up her daughter for adoption. As the bell to the store front rang, I noticed the store owner. The store owner looked like a typical redneck and was pale with long-thin strands of hair that were scantly placed on his head. A crooked and mismatched row of yellowed ivory filled his mouth. Acting like I took interest in his store's wares, I struck up a conversation which led to me being tied up in his basement. 

"Wacha looking for sir?"

"A new flyrod. Old one broke catching the biggest trout you ever saw." 

"I'm gonna have to ask you to put out that cigarette sir." He said ignoring my story, I looked around and noticed another employee. Small and fat, but with what looked like hands that could crush boulders. He was smoking a fat cigar which barley hang from his lip. "Why does he get to smoke?"

"Cause he works here."

"If I buy something, can I keep smoking?" He responds mockingly with, "If you buy something can I keep fucking your mother?" Both started to burst with laughter. The employee laughs so hard his cigar falls from his mouth and he squeals like a pig trying to retrieve it. "Now put out the cigarette." I do. 

"So, what was it you were saying?" He said looking away from me as he started to thumb through a wad of cash he pulled from his pocket. 

"I wanted a new flyrod, but I also have some questions ab..."

"Hank!" He shouted suddenly, startling me a bit. "How much money you got?" The employee Held up his hand and made a zero. "Those fellas up in the hills still looking for food?" I look back and hank was shaking his head up and down, rolling his neck fat. "Fella, you said you had some questions, right?" Looking back at him for a second, I immediately turn back around as I hear Hank start running towards me. Before I could react, I'm tackled to the ground. 

"For fuck's sake Hank don't crush the man to death. I'll be back with the rope." Hank was squealing with excitement when he was on top of me. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I heard the shop owner in the back cursing and rummaging through stuff. The tackle had knocked all the air out of me, and with Hank crushing my lungs I couldn't take a single breath. Struggling to escape, I wiggled with no progress and my ears ringed as I heard the bell of the store front door. A man walked in, saw the sight, and left. "Good Job Hank, help me tie this bastard." Hank got off of me and I took my chance. I sprang forward, head butting the store owner in the stomach. I turn around and ran past Hank and out the door. 

I had ran all the way to my apartment. I locked the door and lit a cigarette.  With no leads I had trouble sleeping, which was good because I was awake for when something had crashed through my window. When I got up to look out the window a large shadowy figure grabbed me. He pulled me through the window, cutting my back on the broken glass. Hank had put me in a choke hold then I fell asleep. 

Waking up, I saw nothing. Complete darkness coupled with complete silence. I was bound and gagged with my back against what felt like the corner of the room. For hours nothing happened. I saw nothing, I heard nothing, and I imagined the worst. When suddenly without warning the lights flicker alive. Under the light was the store owner, and he walked towards me. 

Looking around there was barley anything, an empty basement with the exception of a few sacks and rope. "Who said you could wake up?" I tried to respond through the gag, which I now noticed was one of those red balls, to no avail. After seeing that gag my imagination got worse but trust me that didn't happen. He grabbed my hair and drug me to the sacks. I started to try and plea but every time I spoke, he would kick my side. 

Now in the sack I couldn't see anything again. I felt being dragged up the stairs and I heard the store owner yelling for Hank to help him. I heard the ring of the store bell as cool air rushed into the tiny hole in the sack. To tiny to really see anything though. I was thrown unto hard steel and I heard the engine of a truck come alive. I was hauled out of town like a sack of grain. 

When the truck finally stopped, I heard two sets of feet unload me and drag me through what felt like foliage. Then it felt like wood, then concrete, then cold smooth tile. The sack was lifted, and it took a second for my eyes to adjust to the blinding light. When I can see my face is met with two women dressed as nuns. Except there was no sign of religious symbols, and their gowns were all in white. They hoisted my up to the wall with my hand above my head and I began to hang. They left the room. 

Still gagged I couldn't say anything. I started to look around. It reminded me of a kitchen in a fancy restaurant, but this one would have been abandoned for several years. Grim covered the corners of everything. All the white has turned into a pale yellow. The appliances appear broken beyond repair. Above me, the rope between my hand dangle me on a rusted meat hook. To my left was a big wooden table with blotches of red stain. On top was a man shackled. Blonde, Fit, and missing his right leg. 

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I couldn't believe I was stuck in what seemed to be a horror movie. The man's leg was left untreated. I could see the scar and the exposed flesh and cut veins that went up to the middle of his thigh. Looking at his skin he was so pale there was no way he was alive. The huge pomegranate colored stain near the cut helped my reasoning. 

The musty smell clung to the walls around me and the stale remnants of grease and oil seeps from the tiles near the appliances. The smell of death clouds the air. Making it thick and unbearable to breathe. Most horrifying wasn't the smell or the dead man, or even the smell of a dead man but the wall of instruments by the table. Rusted or stained read, there was a junky shine to each saw and blade. Butcher knives, hack saws, drills, and even a chainsaw was hanging in neat organization. 

The door in front of me, also rusted with a round smudged window in the top middle, flung open. A man in a complete dark red robe paces in. Completely bald, he was the brother I had been searching for. He quickly runs to the instruments near the table. The two nuns in white follow. 

"NO! PLEASE NO!" It wasn't me screaming, or the people who walked in. It was the blonde man I had written off as dead. He starts shaking violently but weak. The man in red grabs a handsaw and fumbles it. The sound of it clanging against tile sets off the blonde man in a fury of screams. He picks up the handsaw slams it down on his left thigh. After, the rhythmic back and forth is accompanied with the wet squelchy echo and squirts of blood. The continuous screaming stops with a thud. The blonde man's head falls back on the table with his face frozen in a twisted contort of pain and shock. He had hit bone. He pulls out the handsaw, with bits of gore falling from its teeth, and he plugs in the hacksaw. It comes alive with a buzz and a sharp grating sound ends with a snap. The man quickly unplugs, switches, and finishes with the handsaw. 

Distracted by the macabre display, I had lost tract of the two nuns. They had a large baking pan, and the man place the entire leg in there. The man walks out with the two nuns hauling the leg away. He slams the door and the sound of lock rings in my head for minutes. At that time, I didn't know what to do. When the sound of the lock stopped, I snapped. 

I started to swing back and forth. The hook hinged and squeaked till it broke. I fell and used the hook to break free from the ropes. I ran straight to the wall of hellish tools and tried to start the chainsaw. No fuel. I settle for a hammer and butcher knife.

I walk to the door and try to open it with no luck. I wait till it opens. Hours must've passed until I hear the lock start to disengage. I ready myself, hammer held high, and as soon as a figure walks in, I swing. It was one of the nuns. My hammer slams into the center of her head and with a large smack she falls to the ground. Her sister nun runs in and grabs her body. Speaking franticly in a language I couldn't understand, crying at her feet. She looked at me the looked away. 

It all had happened so fast; I don't remember all the details. I was in a frantic fight and flight mode. I remember rushing out locking them in and running down an even more decrepit tiled hall. A yellow light glowed from a doorway on the side of the hall ahead. As it grew closer, I heard the sound of chatter. As I turn my head, I stop in my tracks to see the great hall. 

A long wooden table, kept to pristine nearly perfect condition. Lavish plates, silverware, candle sticks, and chalices all lined perfectly. The people all wore expensive tuxedos and glowing white dresses, adored with glossy crystal masks that cover the face from the nose up.  All of them had turned their heads to look at me. 

On their plates were various cuts of meat. No vegetables, no bread, no desserts. Just meat. Their chalices filled with a red liquid, which I would suppose came from what looked like unmarked wine bottles. The big serving dish had a giant pike, like a kabob, spiked through a cooked leg. Beside that was a head, an arm, feet, hands, etc. The serving dish next to it, even bigger had an entire woman on it. Cooked with a burnt crispy outer shell and pink flesh inside. 

The chandelier was made of limbs. Arms and legs tangled and twisted together to form a giant circle. Hands with palms open hold the candles. The mantel above the fire piece was by far the most important. As an unusually large head of a pig, with skin patched together, hang with arms protruding all around it. Looking like a giant art piece, across the pig's forehead signed: Pasce in nomine eius et laetare. 

I stood for a good three seconds, longest three seconds of my life as I remember every detail. I began to sprint. Running down the hall, I glance back and see all of those people starting to exit that room and run down the hall at me. Panting, never wanting to look back, I run till my legs burn. A staircase leads me to a floor panel that opens upon my approach. 

I exit to a wooden cabin. Complete with bunkbeds, canoes hanging from the ceiling, and a poster. A poster which had A giant anthropomorphic pig with kids at a campfire which reads again: Pasce in nomine eius et laetare. I ran out of the cabin into a campground in the middle of the night. I continue running towards the road ignoring everything, nearly getting run over a couple times. 

I had started to walk along the road, the moonlight guiding my way back to the city. While walking, I try and hitchhike to which I got blaring horns and curses yelled at my way. Finaly entering the edge of the city, I see the library. This is where I am as of posting this. I had gotten on a computer to write all this out. I am afraid to go home since they have my phone and wallet and could probably figure out where I live. I haven't had time to really think about everything, please comment about what you think I should do. If I get to another computer, I hope I can respond or at least take your advice.
