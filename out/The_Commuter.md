There were three men at the train station. One was pale, the other two black and ruddy with soot. The pale one – white, unsunned – wore a three-piece suit in black and grey, with mousy hair and a trilby hat. He looked clean and neat and combed and rather like a mouse, if the mouse worked in finance. 

The black and ruddy ones wore overalls, one blue one black, and bore grease-stains over all surfaces. The one in blue had blue eyes too, two gems in a wash of soot and dirt, only smears of skin visible under the muck. The one in black had brown eyes; pools of whisky, I imagined, dark and deep. A hank of hair fell over his face, his beard trimmed short, but clad in sweat and dirt. They did not speak, but clearly knew each other. Railway workers, I thought, and took my place on the platform. 

5.45. Nine minutes. 5.45. 5.54. The numbers tumbled in my head. A tiny switch, that changed it by nine minutes. 5.45. 5.54. 

I shifted around. Looked at my watch. 5.46.
 
The three men stood. They did not speak. I caught the pale one’s eye and nodded. He observed my offer. Gave a cursory nod in return. Then his eyes retreated to the middle distance.
 
I looked at the workers. Black nodded to me. Blue winked. 

I glanced down at my phone. No signal. 

4.56. 

The air was still. I became very aware then that the air was still. 

I would say at this point I became compelled to look in the men’s direction, and I also noticed, of a sudden, a persistent notion in the back of my head which suggested I should very much not turn around. 

The signal light was green. I could see it, from the corner of my eye. Green as a daisy. Green as a lily. Green as a dandelion. Green as blue. I looked down at my clock again. 

5.46. 

Silly, I thought. I glanced up at the men. The persistent notion had left. A pale rich man. Two grease-streaked workers. A normal day. Admittedly a little quiet. But a normal day. A gentle breeze, which slowly stilled, a calm grey sky, clock on the wall rusted quiet, the rustling of leaves from across the tracks. An English red-brick station, one and a half centuries old. Quaint, and quiet, and oh so still. 

5.45.

Still.

I read my book, idly. The book was interesting. Much more interesting than whatever was going on over there, I was sure.

The air was still again. And the sky. Not a cloud moved. The trees did not twitch. I glanced up a second time. This time, the rich man took a clean handkerchief from his pocket and began to unfold it. “Just about the right time for a quick lunch, wouldn’t you say, old chap?” he said. Inside the clean white cloth was a stone, the type used as rubble on railways tracks. He picked it up in thin white fingers. “Mmm,” he added, bringing it to his lips. “Hits the spot just right, wouldn’t you say?” 

He pushed the rock into his maw and brushed his fingers. His thin lips closed around the knobbled stone and he chewed. “Delightful,” he said, with a spray of grout. “Just right.” 

He turned his attention to the chair he was on. “For last,” he said, patting it. Then he stood. He walked to the ticket window, which was unoccupied, and rand his hands along the sill. They were dirtied. He pressed his palm against the glass. With no effort, he took a fistful of window. It came away like icing. He ate; finished the window, glass spilling here-there down his front, smattering on the ground. He licked it up with a glistening tongue, his mouth uninjured. 
He pulled a brick out of the wall. Sucked the mortar from the sides as though it were cake, then ate the brick the same way he had eaten the stone, down in one swift push, lips closing around the outside. Chewing. Then another brick, then another. He made no sound when he ate, kneeling on the floor to pull up concrete, crawling to the corners to eat the drain. The wiring. The tracks. He smiled with cheeks stuffed with rock, gnawing his way though the fence, digging his fingers into the ground and nibbling foundations, chewing, licking. His fingers found the bottom of the bench because his and brought it up to his lips, beam by beam, the metal frame bitten softly to pieces. And the next bench. And the next. The next. The final one was his, and he sank his teeth into the soft wood and groaned in culinary pleasure, eating the wooden beams, the frame, the nuts and bolts. 

The workers moved toward him. I had forgotten they were there. “Enough,” one of them said. They moved like brothers. “Has to be done,” the other one said. The rich man did not move, but raised his hands in mock-horror as they descended upon him, saying mildly “Gentlemen, permit me... really, what would *you* use it for...” 

“Must be done,” one said, “Needs must,” the other said. One Cockney, one West Asian-South London. They took the rich man by an arm each, held him still, though he did not struggle. Blue pulled the man’s shoe from his foot and ate it, fingers rubbed, lips closed. Black took the other, and then a sock, and though I saw the sock come off there was no foot beneath. Same too on the other side, and when Blue began to pull the trousers and Black sank his teeth into a jacket sleeve, it became apparent there was no more to this devourer of brick than his clothes. 

He struggled only once. Black cried “Delightful!”, mocking him. Something came upon his face, a flash of rage, and from nowhere at all he pulled an umbrella and began to beat them off. Blue dispatched this swiftly and pushed the umbrella into his mouth, Black took the other end; they met in the middle. Blue pulled his mouthful away, lines of twisted wire disappearing slowly down, chewing like rabbits. 

The jacket. The shirt. The clean white handkerchief. The man was just a head in a trilby hat, no blood, no gore; it looked as though his neck simply fit into a shirt collar that wasn’t there. The workers’ hands passed through where his body should have been. “Must be done,” they said together, and bit the hat in two. The man was gone. 

They finished the hat. Then they looked at each other, the workers, Black and Blue, and Black pulled at Blue’s overalls. I thought they he would eat him, but instead he pulled them off  and out Blue stepped – half so filthy under as over – and Blue did the same, grease and sweat and hair, and naked as the day they were born. Blue leaned in with his tongue outstretched and, again, I thought he would eat him, but no. They cleaned each other like cats, licking the grease and dirt away until their bodies came up shining. Grime ran down their backs in rivulets until it was washed away, they stretched and curved. They redressed, themselves and then each other. The air was still so still. 

They did not look at me. I stepped away from where I stood at the edge of the platform. It was the only bit of ground still covered. I walked backwards up the lane way until the sky cleared and the wind started blowing again. I heard a train horn in the distance. 5.53. I shook my head. 

I walked twenty minutes to the next station. There was a gentle breeze.
