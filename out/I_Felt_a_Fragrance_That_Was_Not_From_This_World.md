The Fragrance That Followed

In my previous post, “The Visitor No One Expected,” I mentioned our ancestral house built in 1890, where we lived as a joint family until 2014 before it was demolished and reconstructed into a building. That old house had an open aangan with a guava tree, a semi-open dalaan with a roof where my grandmother used to sit and watch her grandchildren, and behind that, my grandfather’s room where Mr. Sikander once came to meet him.

After my strange encounter, when Mr. Sikander came again, I met him and told him how I had felt a heavy weight on my body that night. He smiled and said that I should not have asked what I asked that day. Then he thought for a while and told me to bring a rose.

I told him we did not have a rose plant at home. We only had a guava tree and some plants that my grandfather once took care of before becoming weak. He said I could find one in the neighborhood. I went to our neighbor’s house, with whom we had very good relations, and brought a single red rose. He recited something over it, blew on it, gave it back to me, and asked me to keep it safely at a high place.

I asked him what would happen. He said that whenever they passed near me, I would feel a fragrance. I asked who they were. He replied that they were the same creations of Allah that I had been curious about. I would not see them, but I would feel their presence through the fragrance. He also told me that whenever I felt it, I should simply say Salam(Peace be upon you), because they were good jinns living in our house and we did not interfere in each other’s lives. At that moment, I agreed with this because I was not persistently asking to see them. If they were showing their presence only through fragrance, then I thought it would be a calm and harmless experience.

That night and the next morning, I felt nothing. By afternoon, I had almost convinced myself that nothing would happen. Around 2 PM, while my mother and I were having lunch with the TV on, I suddenly felt a warm, unfamiliar fragrance pass by. It was unlike any perfume I had ever smelled. It was warm, Oudh kind of fragrance, but it did not feel like it belonged to this world. I quietly said Salam.

My mother immediately asked whom I had greeted. I asked her if she felt the fragrance. She said no. I thought maybe this experience was only meant for me, or maybe she was sitting a little far and that was why she could not sense it. When I tried to explain, she became angry and told me not to get involved in such things.

But after that moment, for the next three to four hours, the fragrance kept coming and going with the wind, as if someone was passing nearby again and again. I was silently experiencing it. Later, even my mother felt it. She looked at me with a puzzled expression. I softly said yes, meaning she should say Salam. She did it unwillingly with a weird expression on her face, but then firmly told me to stop this completely.

That night, when I returned from my classes, the fragrance had stopped entirely. I even walked around the house on purpose to check, but nothing happened. With exams approaching, I stopped thinking about it.

After a few days, Mr. Sikander came again and sat in the dalaan, the mini open area. I told him that the fragrance had stopped. He asked me to check the rose. I rushed to the secret place where I had kept it. It was gone. Only I knew that spot. When I told him, he said that they had taken it and that I should not worry because they were not upset. That gave me peace because I did not want this experience to end badly.

The fragrance itself was warm, similar to Oudh, but still completely unique and impossible to compare with any worldly scent.

The Forest Encounter

Much later, one of my distant cousins invited me to his land in a forest area for dinner. After the meal, his son suggested that we go for a walk. We were five people, carrying a battery torch in a village with very few lights. On one side there was a river, on the other side a mountain.

Before going, he asked if anyone among us was napaak. Napaak means impure, like urine, blood, or anything on the body or clothes that breaks the cleanliness required for prayer. We all said no and confirmed that we were paak.

Then he said that the mountain area belonged to good jinns. He warned us not to throw stones and said that if we felt any presence, we should not run. We should all simply say Salam.

None of us felt afraid. We walked peacefully. No physical presence was seen, but every single person in our group felt a very soothing fragrance coming in a particular area. Everyone looked at each other, silently gesturing that something was there. Then, calmly and together, everyone started saying Salam, Salam, Salam instinctively.

The most shocking part was that the fragrance I felt in the forest was exactly the same as the one I had felt in my old house. The same Oudh-like, woody, soothing, yet completely out-of-this-world scent.

Before that day and even after that day, I never felt that fragrance again.
