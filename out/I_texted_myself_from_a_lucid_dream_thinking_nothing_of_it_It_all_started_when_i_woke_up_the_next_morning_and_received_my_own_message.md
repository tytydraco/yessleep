I don’t really know where to start. One night, being kept up by the smashing of hail against my window, i had the idea to see what would happen if I texted my number from a phone in a lucid dream. I’m quite experienced with it, I  practiced while I had nothing else to do during the coronavirus pandemic. But after that idea sparked in my head, the dream I had that night had an indescribable sense of danger. As if I shouldn’t, under any circumstances, have been doing what i was doing. It just felt… wrong.
  
As i drifted off at around 3am, into, well, I don’t know if dream is the right word anymore. Heck, i don’t even know if there is a word for it. Like, hell, or some sort of parallel universe we can only access when our consciousness isn’t in the one we know. Anyway, apart from the weird sense of danger, it was all kind of normal. First i played around a bit, floating through my house, using the comebacks you only think of after an argument, then i remembered what i was there for. I picked up a phone, typed in my phone number. It actually took me a few minutes, because you know, how it’s pretty hard to read properly in dreams. After starting a WhatsApp conversation with myself, i texted ‘hi’ and thought nothing of it. Then after I enjoyed myself some more, i woke up to my alarm.

Of course, i dreaded having to go to work in the morning, having not fell asleep till 3, but regardless i got up and started to get ready. As i tried to connect my phone to my car’s Bluetooth speaker, a rush of pure mortification made my blood run cold, as i read a text message from a random number at 5:01am saying ‘hi’. After the initial rush, i thought maybe i was overreacting. After all, it’s a pretty generic text message. When i finished work at 4pm, i asked around, if anyone knew the number, to which my answer was no. Weird, but not enough for me to think anything of it.

Going back to sleep that night, i thought i’d try again out of curiosity. It felt a bit more dreadful this time, almost like i was being watched. And my once familiar home which i lived in with my family, a wife and two kids, was deserted. Paint peeling off the walls, black mold everywhere, like an abandoned house. However, being the idiot i am , i reached for my phone, typed in my phone number, and typed an indistinguishable text: “1161 , this is dream me texting, 2812”.
As i put the phone down, i caught something out of the corner of my eye. It seemed pretty tall, humanoid, but evasive. I thought i’d best just wake up before my thoughts affected the lucid dream.

I guess you could say this is when it all started. When i woke up that Saturday, i once again recieved a text message, from that same number, reading “1161, this is dream me texting, 2812” . I froze in shock. Have i made the next best scientific discovery ever? Or have i found a way to enter a parallel universe through dreaming? Neither. I gave them a way in.

My family weren’t home that morning. A deafening silence rang through the house when i put my phone down and got up to go piss. And there it was. A message , in blood on the mirror , “We woke up with you.”

But that wasn’t the worst of it.

I pulled back the shower curtain to reveal my wife and two kids dead, with their throats slit in the bathtub. I got in my car and drove, and that’s the worst part. I’ve been hiding in the woods for a month now. No one has came looking. And these… things. They are 9-10 feet tall, humanoid, with extremely long arms, razor blades for fingers, and the more i look the more seem to be stalking me.

Let this be advice to anyone who sees this. DON’T LET THEM IN.
