“Don't go on trusting places ya never went to before, that feel famil’yer,” my mother used to say. I always found her version of English endearing, especially when she stood in front of the wall covered in her diplomas in English Studies. A mix of Appalachian and Cajun twang carried every syllable. Before he passed, my father always joked that there were two things about her that would never change. Her thirst for knowledge, and her hand-me-down way of speaking, that she got from her mother, who got it from her mother, and so on.

It's sometimes hard to tell what parts of my maternal family's history are fact from fiction. The only way to know for sure if a story is real, is if there's a public record of it. For example, the oldest piece of evidence I've found that her side of the family exists is a handwritten marriage license from 1806. 

The wife was Joelle Doufeau, a free black woman who loved to paint, and the husband, Callum Breck, a scottish carpenter. They were “married” by a friend September 18th of that year, in what is now Blue Heron, Kentucky. Over the next 186 years, the Breck family would spread out over the eastern US until my mother, Eugenia, would meet my father, Bertram Havoc, and move to northern Colorado.

Three years into life a mile high, August of 1995, they'd produce a beautiful baby boy, named Kain. That would be me. I tell you all of this, because my mother is missing. The only clue I have of her whereabouts is a photo of an old house, with “BH, KY, Genie 1963” scribbled on the back. It was stuck to my bathroom mirror the morning I realized she was gone for too long, especially for her.

There are a few strange things about this photo. Notice how I said the photo was of a house. There wasn't a single person in the picture, so where was Genie? Also, my mother was born in 1968, so if Genie is supposed to be a nickname for Eugenia, that also doesn't check out. Then, there's that saying my mother always had about familiar places. I couldn't figure it out, but I had this deep, dreadful feeling that I had been to that house before. I've never left Colorado.

Notably, the town of Blue Heron became abandoned in 1962. While it's possible there were a few stragglers, it's hard to wrap my head around my grandparents being among them, as to my knowledge they have lived in Maine a long, long time. Finally, possibly the least weird, this picture looks like it was taken well before the 60s. Sure, it could have just been an old camera, but it still feels strange, holding the cracked and worn photo so delicately.

It's been about two months since my mother went missing. Local police haven't been much help, mostly saying she's grown and so is her only child, so it's not insane to think she's just out traveling. But, knowing my mother, it absolutely is insane. She loves Colorado, she loves her job, she loves the memories with my father, she loves me. I can't fathom her up and leaving it all behind without a word. And so, about a month ago I went to Kentucky.

This house was not easy to find. If you check out Blue Heron on Google Maps and use satellite view, there are notably no houses in sight. Just a small coal mining operation surrounded by dense forest, with some hiking trails and a nearby river. It took three days of trekking the area to find the house, and I was kind of surprised when I did. It absolutely should have shown up on Maps.

The plot of land was flat, and easily 5 to 7 acres. The canopy of trees breaks harshly, and you almost stumble into the garden once you enter the property, as it's the first level land your feet have touched for hours. The house, while definitely old in architecture, looked to be meticulously maintained, but also devoid of... life. And, behind the house, a large field of almost endless lavender. Once you pass the treeline, the smell is almost sickening, burning your nostrils with intensity.

When I first arrived, I stood at the treeline for a long time. My feet felt stuck in the mud below them, and it was suddenly so easy to breathe, I almost couldn't. I was washed with a feeling of nostalgia that was honestly a shock to the system after so much aimless wandering.

It took until I was almost at the door to notice that, beyond the lavender, there was a distinct smell of freshly baked bread. It made me step back a bit, and I saw there was smoke coming from the chimney. Tentatively, I walked up the steps and initially put my hand on the door handle. I don't know why, but I stopped, and knocked.

Almost immediately, as if she'd been standing there waiting, a woman opened the door. My first emotion was surprise, then relief, then nervousness. In front of me stood my mother, smiling.

Or, at least, someone, something, pretending to be my mother. By all accounts, if you only knew my mother superficially, this looked and sounded like my mother. But I've spent nearly 30 years with Eugenia Havoc-Breck, and the person standing in front of me was not her.

This woman's face was a strange, perfectly symmetrical copy of my mom's face. When she spoke, her unique way of speaking was there, and her voice held the same notes as the woman who raised me, but it was almost like someone doing an impression of my mom.

“I wondered when ye’d find me, kiddo,” she said, with almost too much joy.

My throat was dry as I responded, “Hey Mo- mother... What are you doing here?”

She gave me a sad, knowing smile, and ushered me inside without replying. I was smacked with the smell of food, and I realized only then how hungry I was. As she led me through the front hall into a dining room, my stomach audibly groaned. “Have yer seat, baby,” she said as she planted her hands firmly on my shoulders and lowered me into a chair.

Already the table was set, and a feast was forming in the center. The bread I had smelled before sat steaming in a loaf pan, shrimp and grits close by, catfish courtbouillon nearly still simmering despite being nowhere near a heat source, and the rich smell of dirty rice with black beans and corn added turned my head to my left. All dishes passed down through generations of my family and many others, familiar to my taste buds and arguably, my favorites. Looking at the spread, I knew mac and cheese, pork tenderloin, and green beans with bacon weren't far behind.

This woman, supposedly my mother, was waiting for me. She was prepared for my arrival.

“Ye best keep yer hands off that table ‘till I'm sittin’ cross from ye, not too long now baby,” her voice sang from what I assumed to be the kitchen. The foreign inflection behind this impression sent shivers down my spine and I felt sweat building on my neck.

I sat anxious for a moment, and then I heard shuffling behind me. As I turned my gaze, my stomach dropped, as I saw the woman rolling in a man on a wheelchair - a man who, by my best estimate, was my father. Not as refreshed and symmetrical as his counterpart, no. This was my father as he should be - decaying, smelling of rot, and eyes glazed white.

Bile rose up in my throat as I stared, unable to look away, with tears brimming in my eyes. I couldn't tell what was worse, sitting in front of my father's corpse, or the fact that this vile creature had dug his grave and brought him halfway across the country for a family dinner. In my periphery, I swore I saw the creature (who I now knew for sure not to be my mother) smell his body and grin even wider, with too many teeth.

After what was probably too long, I finally turned my gaze back to the dinner table. The food looked a little too picture perfect, almost AI generated, and the smell of lavender filled my nose again. I had to get the hell out of there, but the creature's eyes seemed to be locked on me.

“Now now Kain, I know damn well y’ain’t gonna try’un start supper without givin’ papa a kiss. He traveled so far the see ye,” she said. This time her voice crackled and gurgled, and it sounded as if she spat out my name. The sweat on my neck turned cold as I stood up slowly, and made my way to my father's side. As I approached, I couldn't help but gag at the smell. The creature slammed a fist on the table in protest, and I knew that was my chance.

I ran. I don't know how long I ran for, but by the time I finally stopped hearing her howls at my heels, my legs felt like gelatin and the air burned my throat with every pant. I didn't even know I could run that hard. I know it took hours just to get through the lavender.

I write to you now, because I've been in these woods for a long time. I don't know how, but my phone has stayed charged, and I've not grown tired or hungry. I can't stop for long. When I do, I hear her calling for me in the distance, her voice increasingly distorted and impatient. 

If you find yourself in Blue Heron, Kentucky, please get me out of here. In the meantime, I'll write again if I find my real mother, or a way out of here.
