They had my face.

It wasn’t a bad copy, either. The shape of my brow, the squint I make when I’m peering at something real hard. My glasses, my mannerisms. Posture. My voice.

My hat.

I verified all the rest because, for just a second, I spoke with them. Now, might seem strange I just talk to it. Not going to say I wasn’t quaking in my boots just a little. That my shoulders weren’t tense. But it’s not the first time it’s happened. Some of the local folk, they try to copy others sometimes, to fit in.

But this wasn’t one of those moments, I think. There were plenty of other things that would try to take your face. Permanently, or to ruin you or those you care about.

I flashed my light at where I’d heard the little camera click coming from. It was the exact same type the river folk had given me. I saw my own face smiling back at me. Watched myself tip my hat my way, polite as you please. Then, I watched them casually drop the photo they’d taken onto the road, just at the edge. I’m old, not stupid, and I’d been shaken too bad to fall for that.

I shined my flashlight on it. It was a picture of me, looking out the bus window.

That wasn’t the part that threw me off most. It was when the other me walked into the woods a bit, and I heard a real specific, familiar whoosh. I listened quietly, strained real hard, and I heard the clunk of a pulled lever.

The same one I pulled every day.

I watched my bus pull out of the woods. Same blue and white, that leaping silver cat running across the side. It was clean, and sturdy, and just a little better made than most. Just a little faster, but not by much. It rattled a bit, just like mine. Same windows. I stretched my neck, got an angle, and I saw three empty cardboard boxes sitting at the copycat’s foot.

I pulled up my radio. Set it to my own number. Sometimes I get a hunch. When you’ve been out here for a while, sometimes the obtuse things just make sense to try first.

“Who are you?” I kept my voice level.

They said a name. I think it might’ve been mine, but I don’t remember. Or maybe it was just something familiar, generally. Either way, I paused. I used to have a license, back when it mattered. I lost it a long time ago. I’ve got paperwork from the wall folk, but that’s not really the same thing. There wasn’t really a way they could’ve known.

Was there?

“No, who are you really? What do you want? You been watching me?” A little less level, but it was a bit hard to keep straight faced in a situation like this.

“I’m the Driver. I make sure people go where they need to be gettin’. I see you’ve already got a ride, good sir, but if you ever find yourself-” My old, cracked half-whistle voice spoke back to me, saying things I could absolutely picture myself saying. I heard the tink of glasses being fussed with. I was being real attentive, right then. “-Sorry. Find yourself stuck on the road, just look for the bus stop. Check the green circled ones if I’m not around. Good luck on your route, pal.” Even had that chipper to it.

And that was it. They cut the radio, and they kept driving. I watched their headlights, all watery yellow, vanish into the far distance. I thought for a bit. Had to think. I could follow them on the road, watch them from the road, probably relatively safely. But I had no idea where they were going. They definitely weren’t on the road right now, so they probably didn’t want me to follow. I couldn’t figure out why they’d show me this whole farce unless they had some strange plan in mind.

I called the wall folk. Told them there was a shifter out there. There was a brief second where I could tell the person on the line wasn’t super happy, there was a noticeable dip in the convo. I wasn’t, either. Unless that fellow was going off to help me pull a double shift, and that seemed not entirely likely, there were so many bad things that could happen from the situation.

I couldn’t handle it. I locked all my windows. I rolled up all my windows. Put a charm on the door. Now, if you’re wondering what that looked like, I took out a page from a journal I used to write in, wrote some mannerly words on it, then taped it to the door. Sometimes, those things can help. The little orderly sentences, the reminders, keep watchful eyes your way, and can make folk remember how much they have to lose if they act untoward.

They’d told me that they’d watch the rogue replicant, tell me what they’d been up to in the morning. It was enough, when you’re as exhausted as I was.

I didn’t sleep the best, but it was enough. I don’t get nightmares anymore. Might be a defense mechanism. You’d be surprised, the things you just stop doing, when they become dangerous.

When I got up, I dreaded what I’d see on the paper slips. But I got courage instead. The things I’d replied to, it was mostly just… Odd, at worst. Alarming, some of it, but in a more mundane way than a frightful way. There were three that stood out to me. I’ll read em off’.

**Audible throat clearing.**

*Dear Driver.*

That’s me.

*I don’t think they want me doing ballet over here. I think I forgot to give you something for the ride. I left some things on-*

There’s an address here. One of them funky ones the folk from the bright spot and the locals use. They get, uh, bizarre.

*-You can have something from my space there if you want. I think I’m going to become the lord of a clowder. I love cat.*

Not gonna pretend I know what that means, but I also love, uh, cat. I thought it was plural?

*I’m coming through to visit family again, soon. Will you drive me? I’m the one with the-*

There’s a drawin’ attached. Looks kind of like a wolf with a lop-sided head. You ever see a doll or whatnot, the string is getting a bit loose, so the neck kind of. Oh, you can’t see my hands. I’m making the… Oh, don’t matter much. You know, I’ve always wondered what made pictures different. I’ve seen folk at the gate try to get around the rules by just showing a drawing of themselves. It, uh, don’t work. I’ve also seen people try to pass names on notes and…

I’m gonna move on.

*Sorry I didn’t help. I’m not authorized to use excessive force without approval or good judgement. No radio, no squadmates, so nothing beyond self-defense. And I don’t know what’s right yet.*

Oh. Right. I need to see the Mailman. I forgot to do that today. I’ve been a bit… Distracted. Should probably mention it’s been bout a week since the last recording. I’d not been sure how to go about things for a bit, had been rattled. Just spent a while doing the routes all quiet like. Kept eyes and ears out. It was the damndest thing. I woke up every morning waiting to hear whole busloads of people were just going off, never coming back.

But that fellow, the other me, he just. Did the job. Only real difference far as I could tell, was he accepted payment of a more material kind. Little tools. Do-gabs. Giddy-ups. Money, even. The only real odd thing was he liked photos. A lot.

I didn’t get any crazy calls. I started to relax, even. Thought to myself, maybe, somehow, I’d just gotten another me up and about. Maybe someone was doing me a favor, or it was some kind of gift.

I don’t think I’ll ever get to find out. But I like to think, it was something good. I’m hoping I’m being clear. That you’re following me alright. My head is getting fuzzier lately. I just go off, talk and talk, till even my strangest passengers are looking at me upside down. Lots of little slip ups. I think, maybe, the Mailman gave me this so I’d remember. I talked to myself the other day, even without the recordings. In the mirror. Was practicing what I’d say when I caught up to the other Driver.

I noticed things were a lot easier to remember when I talked about them. Things that weren’t just people, or rules, or routes. Sometimes things don’t smack me in the face till I say them. I don’t know if it’s happened yet, but if I ever just… Stop, I probably remembered something as I said it. I think I’m starting to get why he wanted me to paint the scene. I don’t know all who’s listening, but I don’t think it’s for you.

Maybe I do need an apprentice of some kind. Maybe this was the world’s way of showing me I…

Anyways.

So, the day comes up where things get strange again. I’m sitting there, drinking my milk. There’s a new face on the cartons this time, I’d gotten a new crate. I don’t know how the Milkman does it, but I don’t even need to keep it cold. Oh, by the by. You ever come out this way, speaking of mugs on jugs - cartons - apparently the Moss Man is hosting a ‘bearded rock tournament’. I don’t know what that means. But it mentions some kind of rock for wisdom type thing, and he’s a smart fella, knows a lot about the goings on about, so get your googly eyes and your glue I suppose.

Huh. If I need to find someone, then maybe he…

Thoughts for later.

So I’m sitting there, with my milk. I’m just kind of taking a moment to myself, watching the road. The mile serpent is creeping up. Big old head, forked tongue, just snaking their way through the landscape. I’m in a frostier place right now, where it’s cold a lot, and it snows a lot. Big old sturdy trees far as I can see, and between that, there’s these lakes with ice circles floating in them. Some… Them… Them sphere ice huts. They look kind of like upside down teacups. The bastards who come out of those are vicious, but everyone gets proper when the mile serpent comes around. I’ve seen the giant and the watchers steer clear of it, and I can’t say much else can just… Ignore those two.

I get a call.

“This is Winter Thirty-Seven.” A woman’s voice.

“Yeah? Driver here.” I start slurping some soup to keep warm. I’m putting my gloves on. I put her down for a second to do it, rubbing some warmth into my shoulders while my teeth’re chattering. Blizzard might be coming, I’m thinking, might need to drive elsewhere.

“-Go there.”

I pick the radio back up. “Sorry?”

I hear her huff air. “Your dopple’s been spotted. There’s difficulty with locals. Friendly or unfit is to be determined. Security is on way.”

“Why do you need me for that? Someone need drivin’?” I think it came off rude, but I didn’t mean to.

Swear she hissed. I looked at the big old snake for a second, watched it’s snowy scales rest into the landscape and blend in. Kinda turned into little hills, and I thought of a camel. I swear the serpent looked at me, but I think it was my imagination. So, the lady on the radio says. “One of your previous passengers is having a dispute. You’re nearby, aren’t you? We don’t have any observers or free-roam comms available in the area.”

It figures, I’d thought. Everyone starts digging around when big scaly shows up. When god won’t even come down to smite you, there’s a lot of risks people are suddenly willing to take. I’ve rarely seen anyone do anything violent under the serpent’s gaze, though. It does not appreciate those kinds of things.

I sigh a bit. “I’m over. Where am I going?”

She gives me some kind of specific place. They like using designators for places. I think, maybe, I’ve known so many names for so many places, that didn’t stick, that everything old and new blends together till it’s mush. I remember the names of typical stops and routes, though. If you name a road, I’ll remember it, or if you name a place I need to go to often.

Feel like I’ve been to the cold place, before. Something with an R, or an A. Maybe it’s two places now, all smushed up. A C comes to mind. Where’d it all…

I couldn’t tell you. Don’t think I’m supposed to, and I don’t bother with the maps no more unless I get so daft-brained I need to figure out where I’m at. Or I lose my bus. I don’t know why, but if I ain’t on the bus, or near it, and don’t know where it is-

I’m going back on track now.

So I drive there. I pull up to this little town in the middle of nowhere, half in the woods, half in the open snow. Buildings are big and square, some have round tops. They kind of look smushed, like someone pressed them into the ground real hard, and I think some of them actually might’ve been. Some look like the tops got hit with a hammer and someone just gave up on fixing it.

I drive past a sign that just says ‘Penguin’. There was a picture of a really big penguin looming over someone to offer them hot cocoa. Was a list of town rules, and when I saw them, I remembered I had been here before, most definitely. Not often, but enough it jogged back into my noggin’ easy like.

I go to the bus stop. I see the benches. I have this brief moment where I wonder who builds them all. I know there’s other transports. Vehicles that just stop here, do some trading, then go off wherever they please. Either I’ve just been around long enough or I’m considered respectable, since I’ve never failed to see my face and my rules pop up onto the post or whatever they’re putting the notices on. I’ve only seen a red X three times, in my whole career, and I’m proud of that.

“Son of a…” I start muttering. I see a green circle right next to mine, on the other me’s posting. And I tell you what, it changes right in front of me. Green to red X. Something wasn’t right.

I peer out, kinda hunch my shoulders and try to peek. There he is, my copycat, and there’s a few folk waiting in varying degrees of patient while someone argues with him.

“This was accepted before.” It was a woman of some sort. Weirdly sharp teeth, glinted in the light. But otherwise, looked… Human. I don’t like to use particular words like that too often, feels like it separates too much, but sometimes you need them. “I must return before the next dawn.” She was holding this big old umbrella. Big enough you could probably cover a whole patio. Well, a smaller patio, but still. Was a teenager - least, far as I could tell - who didn’t have teeth so sharp holding her hand.

“I don’t need things like that anymore. I need something… Tangible. You got anything useful? Valuable? I don’t mean to be rude, but I can’t survive off that stuff.” I listened to my own voice address this woman, and my knuckles cracked I gripped the wheel so hard. I’ve driven this lady, before. Wanted to get over the wall, somewhere she could raise her kid normal. Don’t know much beyond that, she talked a lot on the way, and most of it was personal but only half-spoken. Hard to follow.

I started to get out. Parked my bus somewhere I’d notice if someone started messing with it, began walking over. But I got stopped.

“You. You drive the bus.” A man my age beckoned me over. His hands and feet were bare, and his eyes were dark, but he looked me in mine. Smiled with only a few teeth. He had an aura about him, one of wisdom and gentleness, but when you’re old as me that just sets you off coming from a fellow old-baller.

He was wearing a coat made of patches. Big and blue, fur around his neck. Some animal, looked like. Fox pelt? Was stitched right into the neck where you’d usually see white manufactured puffiness. The patchwork made him seem like a walking landscape, all dark blues and old browns and stony grays. He had a cap on, and a lot of little trinkets dangling off him. I pegged him as a local trader type.

“Yeah. Least, I drive the original.” I looked over at the other bus, then back at my fellow coot. “Do you need something, pal?” As I said it, I heard the other Driver drop the same word.

The trader fellow got to the point. “She’s never going home, if you don’t offer me something fair.”

I stood slack-jawed. Blinked at him, then looked over at the bus. Some exchange had been finalized. The woman and her attachment had gotten onto the bus. A few other folk too, I think. If the other Driver was under the same obligations…

…He couldn’t stop, now. Not until he’d gone wherever he’d been told to drive.

I turned back to the bastard in the coat. “You’re not being very polite, or very funny, pal. The hell makes you think you got say?” I didn’t touch him. Even with the mile around, I didn’t dare. Not in town. Not in a place with local rules on top.

He answered me by whirling up a tuft of snow. He looked at the half-white, half-cobbled street. It flew where his eyes did, then dropped. “Your hands.”

“Excuse me?”

“The means of getting to the destination, for the one you want to get there.”

“I don’t trade with unfits.”

He glared at me, but also showed me his few teeth. Like an animal ready to pounce, though his claws were somewhere I couldn’t see them. “Not I.” He said, shook his head like I was the world’s biggest fool, or a kid who’d said something dumb.

Sometimes, I’ll admit. I hate how hard it can be to be polite. How hard it can be to follow the rules, when they just feel like walls. My fists clenched, so hard they shook, and my teeth weren’t chattering with cold this time.

“I got to drive other people later. So I’m not driving bargains right now.” I smiled at him, tipped my hat, and ignored him when he smiled back.

I got on my bus. Called security pretty much immediately. And found that someone had cut the mic off the radio. I looked down and it was dangling from nothing, its little neck split into a wire and not running into the board.

I said some real nasty things, put my vehicle into gear. And then, someone tapped on my window. I looked down. Remember the drawing I mentioned? I saw that face staring right back at me. At an odd angle. Watched the particular individual kinda, push their neck into place. I’ll admit, almost drove off, probably would’ve just put foot to gas if I weren’t familiar with em’.

Sorry if it seemed like I was pretending it weren’t relevant earlier. If I try to make it seem… Dramatical, it’s easier to recount. Like it didn’t really happen, or I’m telling a story to a grandchild. I don’t know if I have any of those, so… That’s going somewhere awkward, never mind.

“Can I get on?” They ask, polite as can be. Almost whispery, like they’re afraid of people hearing their voice.

I debate. Grit my teeth a bit, not sure what to do. But I look over at the mile, see it looking out towards where the other Driver went, so I let them on. Felt like an angel watching over me. “Yeah, sure. Road might be bumpy, though, and I need to make a stop first. Something’s not going right.” I knew, at least, this one could handle themselves.

So they get on. They contort, and there’s this zippery noise. Fleshy, but zippery. They take up half the back, almost. I do the usual things, just in case, and they put a carved bone in my box. I can hear them trying to get comfortable, in the seats and in their own skin. I wince a bit. Some people’s habits, it’s hard to quite… Get used to.

I ask them where they’re headed. “I’m. Sure. Not sure.” It sounds like it hurts for them to talk, but I try to be patient even as I’m tapping my finger on the wheel. “To the group. Group to. Group the.” They wheeze out something I don’t quite understand, but I don’t ask them to repeat themselves. “Stop when I say. Then. Done.”

I pursed my lips. But I drove.

I didn’t see security show up in my rear view. Probably they fumbled in after I’d pulled off. Bad luck always strikes when I least need it. The blizzard, though, that came on quick and easy. The cold swirls started whipping around in the patches of forest, tundra, and frosty lake on either side. When I adjusted my glasses, squinted, I could see all the less obvious roads being carefully danced around.

I could barely see. When I glanced in the rear view, I saw my passenger’s gaze roaming around. When I looked the way they did, I saw something - well, multiple somethings - doing a sort of lope-jump that was shifting between too long and too short a stride. They were more at ease than I was. I let myself try to relax, focus on the road. If they weren’t bothered, I shouldn’t be.

Eventually, I saw yellow lights. Familiar, watery ones. I think I heard a voice trying to shout through the blizzard. It was a lot like mine, and it cracked just the way mine sometimes did when I was choking under stress. The lights swerved. I heard something creak. Someone, maybe a few someones, might’ve screamed.

I assumed, at first, must’ve been the creatures running after the bus. Maybe the other driver had run afoul of some unusual wildlife. Maybe they’d broken a rule, or something was trying to abuse the mile serpent’s presence and didn’t realize harm was harm still. I started sweating despite the cold, wondering if I should be selfish just this once, swerve back the way I came.

My little theory died when I heard the rumble. I watched my passenger look up, quick as lightning, so hard a whole host of sinewy sounds wheezed out of them. The loping creatures, they stopped. The blizzard got bold. I watched it mist out onto the roads. I drove through it regardless. I needed to catch up. And I hadn’t been told to stop yet.

I heard honking. I think maybe the other driver was trying to get my attention. Maybe they’d been trying to radio me, or security. Did they know everyone I did? Were they actually familiar with their passengers? Were they trying to do the same things I was, just borrowing my skin for it?

Eventually, the blizzard cleared. I went from forest to tundra to forest to tundra, icy lake to icy lake. Passed towns, cities, all sorts of places. Communities alive and long dead, places being built. They flashed by me like snapshots into a world I didn’t belong in, or that was old and gone. Someone was lifting the curtain, threatening to pull it back down with each howl of the wind and snapping branch. I could barely see. I can see the road, always. As long as my head is clear enough. But the thing is, I’ve got no sense for what’s on it. I need my older eyes for that.

We weren’t in the cold places anymore. It was warm, almost serene. A great, open patch of grass. I could see wildflower fields all around me. Some of them were littered with small items, all sorts of things. Old music players. Radios. Glass art pieces. Bracelets, belts. I saw a mountain of televisions from a dozen walks of life, some I was sure I’d never even been part of, all stacked perfectly in a tower in a cleared patch ringed by stones and roses.

I felt the roads go away. My world suddenly felt smaller despite my surroundings. A bright light became apparent on the horizon. I heard music. Wonderful music. Bird song. The fluttering of wings, the static from televisions. Happy laughter. I heard a baseball bat swing, the roar of an ice cream truck’s tune. The crashing of waves. There was a whole world, I knew, just over the horizon. One that I could be part of, but which I didn’t know I could survive.

If I listened closely, and the world was silent but for these noises, I could hear screams. Chaos. Weeping, and arguments. There was a sensation like I was on the precipice of a cliff, teetering on a seesaw no one else could see. The worst was the laughter. The other kind. The feeling of being watched, the sinking pain of knowing you’d been cornered.

I’d been here a thousand times. It’s just easy to forget, when I’m not there.

I saw the loping creatures pause at the very edge of this expanse. Right at the spot where it crossed from sectioned landscapes into the border. They were all twisted and strange, but nothing compared to the giant.

Some noises came back. I heard my own voice, sitting in an idling bus ready to go, calling someone. “I need security. I need security. I need-” It went on and on like that. Sounded not just like me anymore, like something between. Something papery and all sorts of off, something old and feeble and trembling. I looked over. Saw the woman with the strange teeth and the umbrella, the umbrella all folded up - I don’t think it could weather this storm - staring.

She still needed to go to her destination. The obligation had to be fulfilled. The only barrier between her and where she needed to go was the great, pale hand, dripping with great bracelets made of thousands of smaller things useful and sentimental. It was gnarled, slightly. Scars bigger than my whole body. Fingers dirty.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t do anything. I watched the other me stall. I was sure he almost ran out of gas. But the roads didn’t open back up, and I don’t think he knew how to use them anyways.

He wrote something, tossed it out the window in a crumpled ball. I think he apologized to someone. He drove, into the light. A smaller hand plucked the woman with the strange teeth out of the bus, like it wasn’t even there. And she was gone. The limb retreated into the earth, and the wolves nobly followed it, hunted the giant despite its club.

I think those words mean something. They feel very familiar, deep in my soul.

“Stop. Must off. Get off.” And my passenger lumbered out into the Outside, the edge of the Unknown, and only stopped, neck snapping in place, to look back at me, ask me a question. “I. Must have title.” They let their voice clear. “I need a title. For later.”

“Lupe. It means river wolf.” Rivers had been on my mind, then. All serpentine, and you never knew when you’d drown.

I only got out to pick up the note, got back in. When I drove back into familiar territory, I watched the loping beasts bound off. One of them stopped, just for a moment, to watch security pull up. They didn’t go any further, not one of them. They turned around and drove off.

I think I remember now why I drive the bus. At least, what motivates it. I don’t know what’s happening, most of the time. I won’t pretend I do. But I want to know people got somewhere nice, when they reach the end of the road. I don’t know which part of the road, what destination, is the one for me, but I can make a good guess where others are supposed to go.

It’s where they want to. It’s always where they want to be, not where they end up.

The note, if you’re curious, says:

*Sorry I couldn’t pick up the slack. It was good while it lasted. I think they want you home.*

They’ve kept me up to date, since yesterday, about where the other me is going. I’ve only seen red X’s on the similar poster now. People’ve started avoiding the other bus, and the people who are new have started avoiding mine. I painted a wolf on the side of my bus so it can be distinguished. The other Driver don’t sound like me no more, not fully. I can’t tell you what went wrong, but I can tell you I wish it didn’t.

He started leaving a trail of photos. Don’t know why. But I can tell you there’s a pattern. A history. The road they trace goes back a long time, to a familiar face I wish I remembered. I don’t know how old I am anymore. Beyond just being withered like a prune. But I don’t think the answer will make as much sense as I’d like when I get it, if I ever do.

I’m gonna hire an apprentice. Might seem strange, after all I just said, but it’s starting to feel a lot more prudent. If you see the flyers, call security. I can figure out where to find you, and figure out something to pay with worth your while. But, if I don’t sound quite right, don’t get on the bus.

Oh, before I go. One of the older slips. I didn’t quite catch onto it till now, I thought it’d been gibberish so I didn’t know what to say. But one of you, if you’re listening, you mentioned an… Other series.

What do you know about the other bus?
