88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 seconds. That’s the time that I have left here, exactly that much. I cannot tell you how much I anticipate it, yet at the same time dread it. Every time I come back, I feel at ease yet at the same time can’t be more frightened than I already am.  
  
My name is Alan, I live in a small apartment in Brooklyn. I live alone, my family lives in Carolina, and I haven’t been in contact with them for 80 years. 80…fucking…years. I am, or at least was a history and archeology college undergrad, but I no longer know if I am even human.  
  
It all began one day when I was browsing one particular web page. Due to the unemployment rate of my profession, I was another loner wasting away in my home, doing nothing but browsing job offers that more or less grew more desperate as time went by.  
  
I’ve browsed nearly everything that you could imagine. From Upwork to even Craigslist. No, even those suspicious web pages with designs more unnerving than found footage. I grew desperate, day by day until I stumbled upon this webpage called 88Explorers.eter. It was a weird name, but the contents caught my attention. It was well-designed, secure, and seemed safe for a web page, and the banner was wide and big and said “NOW SEARCHING FOR ARCHEOLOIGIST TO GO EGYPT!”  
  
I thought that luck had finally smiled at me, that my life had finally turned for the best. I applied, and not even an hour later got a call from this seemingly trusted voice. It had a British accent, a man in his midlife to be exact. He sounded knowledgeable in the field and performed an immediate interview with me on the phone.  
  
Right as we finished, he informed me that I was hired and that the location where I should start excavation in Egypt would be sent to my email with other documents. I know it sounded suspicious, I should’ve known, but despair drives you crazy when you’re an unemployed 30-year-old on the edge of vacating your home.  
  
A week later, I flew to Egypt on a first-class ticket provided by my employer. I then got onto a bus heading south, and I got to the designated place in time. But no one was there, only me and some local man dressed in a long blue gown in this vast space of desert. He noticed me and spoke to me in a very thick accent, obviously knows way too little English.  
  
He took me inside some sort of underground passage, the ancient Egyptian kind. He gave me some documents, told me to sign them, and then took them along with him before he gave me some kind of instruction manual. When I asked him what it was, he just shrugged and told me: “I get paid, told to give that. Don’t know more.”  
  
When I pressured him, he just cursed at me in his mother tongue and stormed out. I was left alone in this, quite possibly, thousands of years old passage with only a backpack and a goddamn manual. I wanted to walk out, call my employer, or just head back home. But I did not have enough money to buy a ticket immediately, nor was I willing to go back with my tail between my legs knowing I would be homeless.  
  
If only I did. If only I wasn’t so persistent.  
  
I read the manual, and it looked simple, with nothing but bulletin points.  
  
One: Do Not Touch The Tomb.  
Two: Do NOT Talk Above a Whisper  
Three: Do NOT Shine Light on the Ceiling  
Four: If You Hear the Faintest Noise, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY  
Five: In The Case That You Get Trapped, Close Your Eyes, Ears, And Mouth and DO NOT OPEN THEM No Matter What Happens  
Six: If You Hear a Voice in Your Head, Do Not Answer.  
Seven: In Case You Feel Uneasy or Cold, Recite Psalm 46:1-3 Until The Feeling Passes.  
Eight: If You See His Face, It’s Already Too Late.  
INSTRUCTIONS: At The End of The Passage, There’s a Pharoah’s Tomb Dating Back To An Unknown Era And Unknown Person. Next To The Tomb, There’s A Golden Vase With An Eight Crafted On It. Take It And Leave Immediately. Do Not Talk To Anyone While You’re Out, Get To The Designated Place IMMEDIATELY.  
  
GOOD LUCK  
  
I didn’t know what the hell I had read. Was it a prank? A fucked up game show? Or some internet troll who wanted to play the world’s most expensive prank? Either way, I only moved through with the dumbest fucking excuse of motivation and walked down the passage.  
  
It was odd. Even an average person could tell that the passage was not the classic Egyptian one. It had no hieroglyphs, wall drawings, or any indication that it belonged to a Pharaoh of all. I just kept my head down, shone my flashlight at the ground, and walked down the passage.  
  
Nearly an hour later, I finally got to the end of it. The tomb was like a giant slab of gold with nothing on it. Not a single engraving, drawing, or indication. Still, it looked fascinating, and I felt some weird attraction to it. Before I realized what I had done, I pulled my hand back from the tomb after I brushed the surface of it.  
  
If you were there, I bet you would’ve seen the soul leave my body. I was scared shitless that I slammed my mouth so hard I felt my teeth shake. As much as I didn’t want to believe in that stupid manual, a terror flooded my mind regardless. I looked around, found the vase with the eight on it, and took it before hauling ass out of there.  
  
But as I ran around the corner, I saw a glimpse of a face peeking at me from down the hall. Half of it, precisely. It looked so horrifying, so unspeakably terrifying and unnerving that I actually pissed my pants and screamed until my throat was sore.  
  
I saw the stairs at the end, climbed them as fast as I could, and finally got out. But right as I was going to breathe a sigh of relief, I noticed my surroundings. I was no longer in Egypt but in the middle of a very dense, dark forest. Eastern European, it looked, and the sky was apparently well beyond dusk.  
  
I no longer had the vase with me. I looked around, called for help, and explored the forest while trying to get some reception on my smartphone. Then I saw it, a small medieval type of village, not even twenty houses big.  
  
That’s it, I knew that either I was going insane, or I was in the world’s most ridiculously expensive TV prank. I went there and tried to find a person to ask for help, but I found no one. I looked around for some more, and then I saw that face peeking at me far from the woods. It smirked at me, IT fucking laughed!  
  
I ran away, running past trees and branches as I heard ear-rupturing screams of pain and torture echoing from everywhere around. It sounded human, with different voices that sounded human and in great pain. I figured it must’ve been that face doing that, but I just don’t know.  
  
I kept running and hiding, for twenty years. Twenty years that I marked all over my body. Every year, I would mark it with a slice across my arm. And right as the twentieth year passed, I woke up in the middle of my low-end apartment in Brooklyn.  
  
The date was: 08/08/2020, exactly one year after I went to Egypt. Words can’t do justice to what I felt, the confusion and despair I had at that moment, yet also the relief. After hours, I figured that I was in the world’s longest nightmare, and had just woken up. Maybe I overslept, maybe I have amnesia…god, I really hope.  
  
The first thing I did, after I calmed down, was dial up the number of my employer, only to be informed that it didn’t exist. I searched for that website again, but it doesn’t exist. It never even did. I went to Google Maps to search for the hidden passage, but that too didn’t exist!  
  
Nothing, not a single trace or clue of what I had been through. It now only exists in memory, that is if it even existed at some point. I brushed it off as me finally going insane after such a long period of unemployment and depression, and decided to move on with my life while consulting a psychiatrist.  
  
That is, until 88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 seconds after I came back. I woke up, and I found myself in a dark labyrinth, surrounded by dozens of men, women, and even children tied to a post, getting skinned alive. Every single one of them cried for help, all of them at the same time. It was so loud that I believe I went deaf, and the warm liquid feeling of blood overflowed from my ears. They also looked as if they were calling for help, from me, but I didn’t know just what the fuck to do.  
  
The next thing I saw was the face, once again, gazing at me from the farthest corner behind a wall. And once again, it began.  
  
Another twenty years, twenty fucking years of hiding and running in this endless labyrinth of death and torture. I saw things that words are too shocked and disgusted to describe, sights that not even cameras dare to capture. I went insane a few thousand times, so insane that I came back to sanity before losing it once again.  
  
After twenty years passed, again, I woke up back in my Brooklyn apartment. 08/08/2021. A year had passed, but my apartment was untouched.  
  
I went insane. I don’t know if it was a dream, reality, drugs, schizophrenia…Whatever the fuck it was, that face was not something I imagined or hallucinated. It’s still etched in my mind, it still haunts me.  
  
And after 88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 fucking seconds on the dot, I woke up in a WW2 Battlefield. Pacific front, Iwo Jima probably. I looked around and realized what had happened. I was trapped, again, by the face.  
  
I saw two battalions, a US and Japanese one charging at each other, and I was in the middle ground. At that moment, I thought that death was the most merciful, and I decided to give myself up to death, and to the face…if only I didn’t.  
  
I can’t die. I was shot, bayoneted, bombed, burned, drowned, skinned, disemboweled, tortured, fed my own body, and experienced the most incomprehensible pain known and unknown to man. I couldn’t die, I couldn’t be killed. He kept me alive, he kept me breathing.  
  
I heard him laugh, I know I heard him, it, snicker, giggle, and simply enjoy my suffering as he watched from afar. After twenty years of suffering, I was once again back to my Brooklyn apartment, and I immediately rushed for my stashed revolver, loaded it, aimed at my head, and shot myself twice  in the head.  
  
The shots pierced my head and blew my skull open. But I was alive, I felt every single moment of pain, every nanosecond of indescribable pain as I lay there motionless with my head blooming like a bloody flower.  
  
88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 seconds after 08/08/2022, I was teleported again.  
  
I have just come back from another twenty years, and now no longer know how much longer I can take this. He’s keeping me alive, I can never die no matter what happens. I get 88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 seconds to live per twenty years! A real year passes in my life, and every time I comeback I see that the world is changing and leaving me behind.  
  
I am alone. There’s no one that could help or understand. And no matter what I do, what I try, what I say, nothing will ever matter because I won’t die, and will soon be teleported again to whatever hell dimension the face is saving for me. Eight…it’s eight, it’s always eight.  
  
That fucking eight on the vase…it’s not an eight, it stands for eternity. He will torture me for eternity, and I can never escape no matter what I do.  
  
Please, for you, who’s reading this…please help me. I have no one, I have nothing, I can’t escape on my own. I know for sure that the vase in that passage is the key to this, please find it, and please help me.  
  
No matter how much time goes by, please try to find that website. Search across all of Egypt until you find that fucking passage, that stupid fucking tomb. Please, I need you. I can’t do this forever. I don't know why it made me immortal, why is it torturing me. Why is it teleporting me one year into the future and keeping my room instact. Is it a sick fucking joke? Does it want to give me hope before it sends me twenty more years to hell?!  
  
If you do find that tomb, remember the rules. Don’t touch it, don’t shine light, don’t talk…don’t fucking look at the face.  
  
I bid you farewell, for now. When I come back in twenty years, I will write again, and I will have to write it on 08/08/2024. I will write and rewrite for as long as I’m alive, so please, help me.  
  
88 hours, 88 minutes, and 88 seconds before eternity.
