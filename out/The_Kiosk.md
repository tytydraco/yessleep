There is a kiosk at the edge of my city, surrounded by old decrepit and barely standing commie-blocks, and just down the main road is the city dump, that is if the smell of the *roosters* or stale milk doesn’t beat it to the punch… I hate those annoying bastards... Just try to imagine the *wonderfu*l smell once the breeze changes course...

I really had no other options. It was either this, university or taking care of my sister who was old enough to take care of herself, and was a better damn cook than I am – or ever will be… She would be the one taking care of me despite being the older sibling. She was always better than me…

 Now, I work the nightshift at that kiosk - and the pay is unusually high, my parents don’t believe me when I tell them. But they do think I am much better with my finances than I actually am – not like I spend much either way.

I am mostly at that damn kiosk, home, or you can occasionally find me at the store buying cigarettes or doing some errands on the rare days I am not at work or rotting at home.

The kiosk is my home, it became my home. Honestly, it is much better than my *actual* home. I am alone and I don’t need to communicate with people beyond – *Good evening* and *Goodbye.* Maybe the occasional small talk with the local drunk which consists of me nodding while the old fart rambles on about conspiracy theories or his own sad life. Kind of makes me thankful for mine, though you never know – I might end up like him in a few decades.

 You might be asking yourself – “Now hold on, unusually high pay?” – For those reading this from the first world, I assure you I am not buying myself a Lambo any time soon. But it is more than enough to live a comfortable life.

The wage is about 2000 dollars a month, when converted from my country’s currency. To give you perspective, that is more than what my parents earn in a month… *Combined*.

 Now the second question you ought to have is – “What in the world are you doing there to earn such a wage? And where do I sign up?” – Okay, you’re probably not asking the second question, and honestly even if you do I can’t tell you… I literally can’t for various reasons. It comes to different people in different ways and at different times. But I can tell you how *I* got it.

 About three years ago I finally finished school. And my grades were not up to snuff to get into a university, though I could attend one local university just by passing one test exam – I think its called a “prom exam” in English – I really didn’t feel like it. So, my parents gave me the ultimatum. Work or university, and I chose work. Hey, at least I can have my own money, right?

And so I started working, first it was a factory job, then security for a short while, I worked as a store clerk for a few months. And then after I was laid off the construction gig my uncle set me up with, which just so happened to be in that part of the city where the kiosk is located…

I really didn’t know where else to go. And as if the powers that be heard my call, I stumbled upon that kiosk. It was closed and an old man was smoking a cigarette outside. And I saw there was a sign on the kiosk –

*“Looking for employee”*

I approached the old man who had the stench alcohol and tobacco surrounding him like an aura… And a hint of stale milk. Let’s call him “Winston” – He likes those cigarettes, smokes only them.

 I got the job.

Winston was more than happy to get me onboard for the nightshift… I of course asked for the pay and he told me that it is slightly above minimum wage, which I was fine with. He *did* say there were other bonuses on top of the main pay, but that they vary a lot. I was okay with that too, if any extra comes my way I won’t be complaining.

 I worked the day shift first, he showed me the ropes, where everything was, how to treat the customers and so on. Boring shit. The kiosk was rather spacious inside but filled to the brim with all kinds of products and knick knacks. There was even a desk with a lamp in the corner where employees can go and do their own thing…

The toilet though… I’d rather go piss or shit in the back of the kiosk and let the whole neighborhood see me and let the roosters suck me dry than to touch that fucking door with 10 meter stick, nay, a damn laser…

Agh, I am getting off track, where was I? Ah, yeah, the job itself.

The boss told me to open up a specific drawer in the desk which was in the back, the one that I mentioned, if a customer comes over during the night and asks for a *number* from 1 to 12. And that I charge them not with money… But *teeth.* Of course I was a bit weirded out by that, but I won’t question it. I worked in construction and saw my fair share of weirdos in this place, so okay, teeth for numbers it is – He also added that the price, or rather the amount of teeth, is written on the bottle. So I charge however much it says on the desired bottle. Bottle of *what?* I don’t wanna know. He just handed me the keys to the drawer and told me not to open it unless there is a customer ordering it.

Now that I think about it I can’t really remember my first shifts, once I got into it… It all blended together. After a while the scratching on the kiosk roof became normal and I don’t know if it’s sleep deprivation or what but I swear to whatever deity rules over this Earth, I can see little people run in between the vodka bottles on the top shelf. *I’ll catch those thieving gnomes eventually…*

 Anyway… I’ll tell ya a couple of stories from what I’ve experienced thus far.

I honestly don’t know where to start… What unusual stories do I have… Well, which ones *aren’t* weird to be begin with… I’ll just start with the old drunk.

There’s this old alcoholic who shows up around 9 or 10 o’clock. He buys a liter of vodka, a pack of gum, and on the rare occasions when he’s treating himself, a pack of cigarettes. Other times he begs me to lend him a few of my own.

Let’s just call him “Smirnoff” – you can guess why – Now Smirnoff looks like your average hobo. Balding with long strands of white hair, a beard like steel wool and teeth so yellow that you could mistake it for gold and clothes that look like they’ve been in the dump since ‘89. And of course he hasn’t seen a shower or soap since the fall of the Iron Curtain.

 I don’t even need the lights to see his face to know its him when I open that little window after the first few knocks – *I can smell the old fart.*

He’d always ramble about some weird shit they’d be building down the road. I worked there and I knew it was just some new office building or some shit.

Nothing strange about that. But he’d always insist they’re building some sort of cultist get-together spot where they’d sacrifice babies to some ancient sleeping God… He’d also ramble about fairies and how aliens are to blame for his alcohol addiction. Or was it fairies? I dunno.

He was a regular, as you’d imagine, so I knew the spiel he’d go on every time. Sometimes he’d go at it for 10 minutes, and the longest was almost a whole damn hour. It got to a point I wanted to get out of the kiosk and shoo him away…

But I can’t really go out before sunrise. Rules are rules, and Smirnoff wouldn’t listen to a word I say, so it wasn’t worth it. I had to sit through whatever shit he had to say. It mostly entered one ear and went out the other but some tidbits were interesting to hear from his slurred speech.

For example, he said he served in the army before the old country decided that Communism isn’t actually a good way to organize a state. When he was in the army the military had this special unit that hunted some sort of entities around the whole region, capturing them, experimenting on them and just doing all sorts of shady clandestine shit.

It was interesting to listen to that, chiefly because he finally mentioned something he hadn’t already told me for the 160^(th) time. So, I listened.

See, one day, he did not show up, interestingly just the day after he told me about his army adventures. I didn’t think much of it, could’ve gotten drunk and fallen asleep elsewhere. But then he wasn’t there the next evening, or the evening after that. At that point I thought he was dead. But then during the start of my shift, right after my day shift colleague left, a black car with tinted windows rolled up and two men in suits exited.

It was something right out of the Matrix. They approached me and started asking me about some guy whose name I didn’t recognize, but I assumed was Smirnoff. They asked me if he told me anything, I told them that the old fart had schizophrenia or his brain was just too destroyed by alcohol to talk about anything coherently.

They seemed satisfied and left me alone… I did notice they had a scent of stale milk… With hint of lavender?

Anyway, I never saw Smirnoff again… But ever since then the little people have been more active around the vodka. I wonder if it has anything to do with Smirnoff’s disappearance? Maybe his soul is trying to open one last bottle before he goes into the afterlife? Who knows.

All I know is that those tiny little bastards knocked another bottle off the shelf and then ran off to whatever hole they entered through, those bottles go off my damn paycheck – *little shits*…

Agh, I should talk about *them.*

 The Bloodsuckers.

Now you might be imagining some Nosferatu type monstrosities ready to suck you dry, but no, they are not.

They look like you and I. And I swear I’ve seen some of them walk in the sun without issue, somewhere… They always look, *familiar.* They’re the ones who buy the Wintston’s teeth-moonshine bottles. Now, I don’t know exactly what’s inside of them, but I can only assume it’s blood, looking at the vampiric looking bastards coming over, but it could be some kind of wonder drug for all I know…

There’s no money exchanged though, only *teeth*. Plus, they all look very old yet very young at the same time. They send shivers up my spine each time they gently knock three times on the small window of my kiosk. I just know its one of *them.*

This woman… Or whatever *it* is comes over at rare occasions and usually orders number six. What the numbers represent I have no idea, but she likes her sixes. Out of all the others who are usually more reserved and like to stare into my soul and drain the air from my lungs by their mere presence.

All the others look unique but similar to each other, sometimes I mix them up. But miss Six, she’s one to remember. At first I thought she was a normal customer – there are still normal customers, but rarely.

When she knocked and I opened that tiny little door slash window, I was greeted by a red haired and green eyes woman whose face and smile were something right out of a work of art.

I kept my monotone professionalism though, but her warm demeanor made my night that much bearable. But then – *“Darling, number six please!”* she said it with a wink while extending her pale hand that held a small pouch – 18 teeth… I am no dentist but I am fairly certain they looked human…

The rest of her *brethren*; if you could even call them that is monotone or just don’t seem to give a shit about me. Some of them seem outright hostile but try to hide it…

At least missus Six is nice, I really appreciate her chatting me up here and there, even though my responses are limited to a few nods and short replies. I do try and give her a soft smile once I grab the pouch of teeth and give her the mysterious liquid in the bottle… But yes, I do not mind the others just getting it over with, if anything, I prefer that.

Now, Winston told me only later on that I should not leave the kiosk under any circumstances because of the Bloodsuckers – he calls them “Those thieving pricks” for your information, so he is not gleefully accepting teeth as payment… *At least I know my boss doesn’t collect human teeth.*

Anyway he says they tend to be aggressive like the *roosters*. He never told me what they’ll do to me if they catch me outside… I mean, others just go around fine; the locals? Agh, I never did understand it.

Well, onto the next one I guess… A more recent development with the *roosters.* The thing with the roosters is that they are not visible. You can’t see them, but they sure as hell can see you. But like any other person or thing that comes to this kiosk, they seem to respect its boundaries, for some reason.

 The roosters – as Winston told me, like to rip people apart. But they choose their prey carefully and leave no traces behind. Why do I call them roosters? Well they become more and more active as the night progresses and just before sunrise tend to bang and scracth on the kiosk roof and walls like they are desperately trying to get inside.

They’d wake up anyone from the deepest of slumbers. Sometimes they do shake up the kiosk a bit to knock some things down, but nothing too much. It ain’t broken bottles but its just fallen candy bars and such.

I am not restocking it anyway…  The boss does it. But I am paid enough to pick them back up and place them where they were at. I am not that lazy.

Now… Oh, yeah… Those fuckers who destroy the bottles. See, this is more of a recent development. A couple months ago a dump truck broke down in the middle of the street sometime early in the morning, I’d guess somewhere around 3:30.

That truck stood there for hours, hell even Winston said it was there for a long ass time after I left my shift. It was coming from the direction of the dump. So it was empty and didn’t make the smell any worse than it already is. But it sure as hell was unusual.

I mean they had a problem with the engine or something and they just got out and left it there… Running, wasting fuel. I’m pretty sure they got fired after that.

After that night, the bottles started dropping and I heard all sorts of tapping and whispering among the shelves. The little people came from the dump riding on that truck… I am sure of it. And they were the ones who sabotaged the engine, the sly bastards…

Winston thought I was full of shit at the start but soon enough he told me he saw them himself. And he told me not to follow any of the bastards. I nodded, but honestly even he couldn’t stop me in my righteous crusade to cull those little bastards and shoo them off my – I mean, Winston’s property.

And exactly two weeks after they first appeared, I managed to get a glimpse of one who got down to the ground. We just got a new shelf for the center of the kiosk itself, which split the kiosk into basically two rooms that went into a circle. Now the little shit rounded the corner and so did I… But I didn’t see my desk and lamp.

I saw a hallway, a hallway made of shelves with all sorts of things, it had aisles upon aisles of shelves. It looked like a damn library of kiosk shelves… Something right out of a goddamn fever dream. Including a lot of vodka, of course. I imagine Smirnoff would see this place as his own personal heaven.

I really thought if I was hallucinating but after blinking and slapping myself I was fairly certain that there was indeed a whole long ass hallway inside the kiosk which was… It was simply impossible.

My sleep deprived dumbass thought it be a good idea to venture forth into the hallway and see where that little dude went. But I was luckily stopped from doing something stupid by a knock at the small window. A customer.

It was Miss Six – I remember her soft smile as she handed me the teeth pouch. I automatically went to the desk to retrieve her bottles… I stopped halfway, realizing that the *halls of vodka* tear in reality… Wasn’t there?

“Dear, is everything alright?” I remember Miss Six ask as I froze in place. I shook myself out of it and got her bottles.

After I got rid of her I returned to the desk and confirmed that I probably hallucinated the entire thing. It was just my desk… And the rest of the boring room.

Then I decided to walk back to the front, but the other way ‘round the central shelf. I turned my head around, I don’t know why. But there it was.

The fucking hallway materialized again. I went to the other side again – No hallway. Then walked to the other side, the hallway was there again.

 I wrote a note as reminder to inform Winston of the, I quote –

 *“Transdimensional tear in reality, maybe caused by the vodka stealing-gnomes Possibly safe. Probably not.”*

Once my colleague arrived to relieve of my shift… His reaction was indifferent. I just told him not to go inside. *I doubt he moves at all during the shift.* He’s a weird dude… Never did talk to him… I don’t even know his name.

***Note to self : Learn the chronic insomniac’s name.***

Anyway, Winston’s reaction to finding his Kiosk has a portal to a pocket dimension was not of shock, but of pragmatism. I mean, it seemed like there was an infinite amount of stock inside there. He went inside without a second’s thought and grabbed a few things… Financially, this was a win.

He told me it was safe to go inside – But to be cautious, of course. Grab some things to fill the shelves… He also added another thin wall to block the fact that people can see if I walk behind the shelf and not emerge on the other side, that would be freaky.

I doubt any of them would be surprised… Or care. But okay.

You know after working here for this long, yeah you get used to some things. But the constant scratching and the constant threat of whatever is out there… I don’t have the nuts to go out at night myself anymore.

I get to work, I stay inside. I try to do my thing. I never sleep, ever. I mean I do sleep a little when I get home. But at the job? No, I can’t. My brain just refuses to shut down.

I swear its like this place is keeping me awake.

It sometimes feels alive, like the walls are pulsing. You know the radio that plays inside sometimes has interference… It’s an old piece of junk. But I swear I can hear voices on the other end calling my name…Beckoning me to open *the door.*  I could just be hallucinating from the sleep deprivation. Which is the more likely probability. Or I could just simply be going insane… Or this place is just cursed.

I feel like this job is slowly draining me something, not just energy… Each shift I feel like I lose a bit of myself to something. Each shift becomes somehow longer and more unhinged in some ways. But I came to a point where it just becomes the new normal.

Even if I told anyone no one would believe me. So I am writing this here as some sort of diary. I’ll probably write more… This was cathartic in many ways, to just write this down. I’ll do my best to catalogue my experiences.

I still have stories to tell, but not much time to write. And honestly I don’t know for how much longer I’ll work here… Either I’ll quit – or this place will consume me before that.

 The money’s good, at least.

…

You know, Miss Six did tell me yesterday I looked like I needed a hug…

I might take her up on that offer.
