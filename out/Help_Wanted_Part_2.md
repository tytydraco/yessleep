It had been a few weeks since that day in the basement.
My life was in complete shambles.

I barely slept. I barely ate. I barely spoke.

Every morning I opened the shop with him like nothing was wrong, and every night I went home and sat in the dark praying no one else walked through that door. I tried everything, slow service, wrong directions, telling customers we were out of stock. Anything to keep people away from him.

But he had caught on.

A few days ago he had pulled me aside and said, “You’re not holding up your end of the deal. And I don’t like repeating myself.”

That was the only warning I got.

That morning, my phone buzzed while I was sweeping the front aisle.
It was my mom.

“Hey sweetheart! I’m in your area! Thought I’d stop by and surprise you at work. I’m so proud of you.”

My stomach dropped so hard I nearly passed out.

I turned toward the counter and he was already staring at me.
Smiling.
Like he’d been waiting for that exact moment.

“Guess I figured it was time to… motivate you,” he whispered.

I hadn’t known he had her number.
I hadn’t known he’d call her.
I hadn’t known he’d actually bring my mother into this place.

But I knew one thing for damn sure then.

He wasn’t going to stop.

The sound of the door chime made me jump out of my skin.

“Where’s my working man?!”

Shit.

“Ma, what are you doing, you shouldn’t be here.”

“Can’t a proud parent come support their child! You finally have a steady job and seem like you are turning your life around.”

“You don’t understand.”

“Well hello there! You must be the mama!” my boss called out from the back.

“Why yes I am and you must be the man who finally gave my boy a chance! I’m a hugger do you mind?!” my mother held her arms open.

“Oh but of course!” He glanced over to me with the most devilish grin.

As they embraced I could see he was smelling her hair. And then he looked over to me and gave a wink.

My mom let out a little laugh as she pulled away from him, completely unaware of the look on his face.

“I can’t thank you enough for giving him a shot,” she said. “He’s had a rough few years, and this means the world to him. To us.”

His eyes never left mine.

“Oh, he’s been very helpful” he said. “Real dependable. I don’t know what I’d do without him.”

My lungs felt tight. My hands were shaking so bad I had to shove them into my apron pockets just to hide it.

“Ma, we, we were actually really busy today. You shouldn’t stay long.”

“Oh stop it. I won’t embarrass you.” She reached up and fixed my collar like I was ten again. “I just wanted to see you at work.”

He stepped closer.

“Well, if you came all this way, let me give you the tour.”

“No,” I said quickly. Too quickly. “No tour. She’s gotta go. Right, Ma?”

She looked stunned. Hurt.
And that killed me more than anything he’d ever said.

“Oh honey… I just wanted…”

“It’s alright” he interrupted smoothly. “She can stay a bit.”

He moved behind her, placing a hand on her shoulder.
She didn’t flinch. She didn’t know.

But I knew.

I knew that hand had dragged people down those stairs.
Strapped them into that chair.
Wiped blood off walls.
Held a hammer like it was an extension of his body.

My mom smiled at him.
He smiled at me.

And something inside me snapped.

I stepped forward and grabbed her arm.

“That’s enough. We’re leaving.”

“What’s gotten into you?” she said softly.

But before I could answer, he spoke again, voice low, almost playful.

“If she leaves now, she’ll miss the best part.”

I froze.

My mother looked between us, confused, her smile fading.

And then he said it,
quiet enough that only I could hear it.

“I’ll let her go… but someone else’s mother dies tonight.”

His breath was warm on my ear.
Every word hit like a hammer.

My stomach felt like it was folding in on itself.
My mother was still smiling politely, completely unaware of what he had just said, completely unaware of who she was standing next to.

I swallowed hard.

“Ma” I said, my voice barely holding steady, “I really need you to leave. Right now. Please.”

She frowned. “Honey, you’re scaring me.”

He stepped back, arms crossed, watching the scene unfold like it was a damn TV show.

“Ah, don’t mind him” he said. “He gets nervous when we have visitors. He’s still learning the ropes.”

My mother looked at him, then at me.

I shot him a look that said Don’t you fucking dare.

He raised his eyebrows, amused. “Maybe I’ll show you, if you stick around long enough.”

“MA. GO.”
The word ripped out of me louder than I meant it to.

She flinched.
And it shattered me.

“Okay” she said softly. “Okay, sweetheart. I’m going.”

She gave one last uneasy glance at him, then headed toward the door.

Every step she took felt like a countdown.
A fuse burning.

The bell chimed as she left.
I watched her walk to her car, unlock it, get inside, drive off.

Only when her car disappeared down the road did I finally turn back to him.

He was grinning.

“See?” he said. “Motivation.”

He spread his arms like he’d done me a favor.

“You keep trying to stop me from having fun. I can’t have that.”

“What do you want from me?” I choked out.

“Simple” he said. “Tonight, you picked someone. Anyone. I didn’t care who.”

I shook my head. “I’m not—”

“You are. Or I will visit your mother after her shift tomorrow. I know where she works. What time she gets off.”

He paused.

“You get the idea.”

My legs felt like they were going to give out.

“And don’t worry” he added. “I made it easy. Someone always walks in eventually.”

He clapped once, cheerful.

“Now then, back to work.”

For hours I prayed no one walked through that door.
I stayed behind the counter, pretending to organize receipts I couldn’t even see straight. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

Closing time was fifteen minutes away.

Ten.

Five.

I could taste freedom. Just one day. Just one more day to figure out what the hell I was going to do.

The bell above the door rang.

My heart plummeted.

A woman walked in, mid to late 30s, hair pulled back, paint on her jeans like she’d been working all day.

She gave me an apologetic smile.
“I know you’re almost closed, I’m sorry! I started a project at home and I had to finish it tonight.”

I didn’t answer right away.

I couldn’t.

Her face blurred.
My ears were ringing.
My vision tunneled.

Behind me, I heard his footsteps coming out from the back.

Slow.
Deliberate.
Cheerful.

“Why hello there!” he said brightly, like that was the best moment of his day. “Don’t you worry, we’re always happy to help someone finish a project!”

The woman smiled back, completely unaware.
Completely doomed.

I stepped forward fast, blocking her path down the aisle.

“Ma’am,” I said quietly, “we were actually out of”

He cut me off.

“Oh, he’s new,” he said with a laugh. “We’ve got everything you need. Tell me what you’re working on.”

She turned toward him.
I looked at the door.
I looked at him.
I looked at her.

My body felt like it was filled with wet cement.

“I’m fixing up a playroom” she said. “Just a simple one. My kid’s toys keep ending up all over the floor.”

Kid.

She had a kid.

Of course she did.

He clapped his hands together, delighted.
“Well, let’s get you all fixed up then!”

She smiled warmly. “Thank you.”

And that was when he looked at me,
a long, slow stare.
A stare that said,

“Choose.”

I felt sick.

She didn’t know.

I did.

Her life now hung between my hands and my conscience, and no matter what I chose…

Someone was going to lose a mother that night.

She followed him down the aisle, chatting about brackets and stud finders like that was any other night.
I stayed frozen behind the counter.

Then he walked past me.

“Distract her.”

One command.
One life.

My mother’s face flashed in my mind.
Her smile.
Her hug.
The way she fixed my stupid collar.

I chose.

God help me, I chose.

I stepped forward, forcing a smile that felt like it was stapled to my face.

“Ma’am? Uh sorry, could I just ask what kind of screws you were using? Some don’t hold well with cheaper brackets and I didn’t want you wasting your time.”

She stopped walking and turned toward me, hands resting casually on her cart.

“Oh, um… I’m not sure. I just grabbed…”

“A few might strip,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Let me show you, just look here, right on the label.”

She leaned in to read it.

I wished she hadn’t.

I wished she’d ignored me.
I wished she’d kept walking.
I wished I’d died instead.

The hammer came down with a sound I would hear in my sleep until the day I died.

A wet, heavy crack.

Her body crumpled before I could react, legs folding under her like they didn’t belong to her anymore. Blood sprayed across the linoleum, my apron, my hands.

I didn’t scream.
I didn’t run.

I just… shut down.

Everything went black.

My arms were tied tight to a chair when I woke up, wrists burning.
My ankles strapped down.
A gag pulled so tight into my mouth I could taste old leather.

Across from me, the woman was tied to another chair.
Barely conscious.
Barely breathing.
Her head hung forward, blood dripping in slow, steady taps onto the concrete.

“LET ME OUT! PLEASE! JESUS CHRIST! LET ME OUT!”

My voice echoed off the cinderblock walls.

Footsteps approached.

He stepped into the room wearing full coveralls, mask, gloves, boots, everything.

His voice was muffled behind the mask, but the cheerfulness was unmistakable.

“Good, you’re awake! I was worried you’d miss the lesson.”

I shook my head violently. “Please, please don’t, please.”

He raised a finger.

“You need to understand something, son. If you were ever going to take up the mantle… you needed to learn properly.”

He reached for a rolling cart covered with tools.
The metal clinked like wind chimes from hell.

“No” I sobbed. “No, no, no. Please, I can’t.”

He leaned in close until our foreheads nearly touched.

“Then open your eyes.”

I squeezed them shut, sobbing into the gag.

A moment of silence passed.

Then agony exploded in my thigh.

I screamed. Raw, primal, my entire body convulsing against the straps as he twisted the screwdriver deeper into the muscle.

“OPEN. YOUR. EYES.”

I did.

I had no choice.

My vision blurred through tears as he turned toward the woman, picking up a tool I couldn’t fully see.

“This” he said, “is how you start.”

I screamed again.
I screamed until my throat tore.

And he smiled behind the mask, raising the tool like a conductor ready to begin an orchestra.
