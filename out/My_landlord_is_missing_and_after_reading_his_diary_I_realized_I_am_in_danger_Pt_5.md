He looked at me and then looked at the pen. He seemed, for the first time, utterly shocked and just sat there in silence.

Minutes passed without movement or reaction. 

Then, he moved. And without a hint of panic on his face, pulled out the pen and threw it off of the bed.

“This is why you were meant to receive my gift,” he stroked my hair, “you are strong.”

Silent tears streamed down my face. Was this the end? Was this the final punishment or was this exactly what he said, a gift?

"Stay still and keep your eyes closed."

I felt my body unnaturally stiffen and my eyelids shut. I couldn't move, I couldn't open my eyes, even if I tried.

Suddenly, I heard a faint noise I couldn't quite discern. It sounded like a sword, like a knife being unsheathed. It was a whooshing, clicking sound, but it didn't quite sound like metal.

I felt his body inch closer and closer to me. The sudden fear hit me that maybe he was going to slit my throat. Was he going to kill me, after all of this? 

But I couldn't run, even if I wanted to. I was affixed to the bed like a statue. Perhaps I was about to die, and I was too fucking stupid to know that I had sealed my fate.

That was when I felt it, a cutting sharpness against my neck. Sooner than I could process what was happening, I realized my neck had been punctured, but not by a knife.

I opened my mouth to scream but all that came out was a strangled moan. Oh no. What was happening?

My neck was being sucked, I could feel myself losing blood. Was I going to die?

For a moment, I think my body was beginning to resign itself to death. If this was death, then so be it. Panic, fear, and acceptance of my near-certain death were beginning to subside. My body stilled and everything went black. 

When I awoke, the first thing I noticed was scorching pain. I screamed and flailed, it felt like fire was coursing through my veins. Was I having a seizure, was I going to die? I think at some point, I started crying. 

Something was happening inside of me but I felt manic, comatose, and aflame all at once.

This continued for what could have been minutes or hours. I lost track of time. When the burning stopped I felt my heartbeat and breath slow. 

"Open your eyes. You are free to move now, as well."

I opened my eyes. I couldn't see anything different about myself but froze when I looked at him.

Four fangs framed his otherwise normal face and he smiled. 

"This is my gift to you," he gestured to my neck, "forever."

I clutched my neck in horror. "Forever?"

He leaned in to kiss me, "Yes."


...

“Hello,” I said slowly, clicking record, “this is what my life is like now. Some listeners know that it's too late to save me and others will learn to stay away.”

I rubbed my knee sadly. “I’m a monster now, just like him. I… hate to say the word ‘vampire’. We’re more complex than what is typically shown in the media and there are fewer of us than people would expect.”

I exhaled and my voice cracked, “I am so lonely. If you’re listening to my story, can I call you ‘friend?’”

I laughed ruefully, “Great. We’re all friends now. Don't seek out vampires, they will kill you. The great seduction you seek is eternal imprisonment. I am his prisoner in all ways. See my story as a cautionary tale.”

I tapped my fingers against the sticky notes pad I used to first tell my story. “You have no one but your maker and whoever they allow you to be around. You can't harm your maker, either. And we are virtually indestructible. Doctor…”

I shuddered even saying his name, “Doctor Moskowitz set himself on fire and hatcheted one of his limbs shortly after he turned me.”

“Nothing happened to him. The fire made him glimmer and the hatchet barely made a dent.”

I glanced at the now framed pen on the wall with the caption, “The last attempt of my sweet one.”

“He relishes displaying his power to me. It's not about intimidation, I think. But rather to remind me that running away is a fruitless endeavor. When he isn't showing off, he love-bombs me relentlessly. But he’s far less dashing and subtle than he thinks he is.”

“Listener, will you listen to me? Men like this want to possess you, nothing more, nothing less. And when those men are vampires, everything becomes exponentially scarier.”

I put my hands on my face. “I… don't have a choice when he tells me to do things. If you've ever had sex with someone while entirely disassociated from your body, it's something like that. Unless he tells me to enjoy it, then it is psychological torture.”

“I don't want to feel, think, and do the things he says, but I don't have a choice.” I glanced at the sticky pads once more, “This is the only outlet for my autonomy, this is my only connection to the outside world. I want people to know. I want to feel less alone. I want to feel like a human again.”

I flopped on the bed and closed my eyes. 

Heavy footsteps sounded and before I realized what was happening, his breath was on me.

“I think it's very romantic that you tell your little friends about us.”

I didn't dare open my eyes and remained silent.

“No doubt people will still come, still seek me out. Truly, it's great PR.” He sat on the bed beside me. “Look at me.”

My eyes opened and I stared at him intently.

“Thank you for supplying us with an endless stream of blood. Your sob story is very convincing.”

He stroked the nape of my neck, his bite marks.
