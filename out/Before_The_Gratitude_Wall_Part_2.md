I screamed so loud I think all the neighbors heard me. My parents came in and I showed them the picture and they didn’t know what to say at first, but then they called the police. Soon the whole house was filled with police officers. They showed the police the picture, and they took a lot of notes and asked a lot of questions.


  
One of the bigger policemen gave me a blanket and I sat in the corner in the blanket kind of rocking a little bit. It made me feel safe. I don’t know why. The police asked my parents a lot of questions and I listened to them. They wanted to know if they’d gotten any weird phone calls or emails or anything like that, but they hadn’t. Nobody wanted to hurt them, as far as they knew.
  


The big policeman wrote all of that down in a notebook and said some things into a radio. I couldn’t hear what they were but I think they were numbers. Other policemen looked at the picture and tried to get fingerprints off of it and figure out where it came from.
  


I talked to Rosie while they were doing this. She wanted to know everything but I couldn’t tell her everything. I didn’t tell anybody about the blood on the wall or the scary things I saw in my head. They wouldn’t believe me. Daddy hadn’t believed me before.
  


The big policeman from earlier came over to me and smiled, then leaned down to whisper to me. I looked at him, curious what he was doing. Then I saw his face go black and cloudy and his eyes disappear and he said to me: “You broke the rules Charlie. No running to Daddy. You really are a stupid little shit aren’t you? You’re a fucking joke and you never should have been born. I’m everywhere Charlie. You think you can run away from me? If you do this again I won’t kill your Daddy, I’ll make you do it, cutting off pieces of him until you beg me to let you take his place.” Then his face went back to normal. 
  


I stood up and screamed and screamed, and everyone in the room looked at me like I’d lost my mind. I pointed at the policeman and said “It’s him! He did it! It’s the Gratitude Doctor! Please you have to listen to me!” But he was gone.
  


The other police officers looked at me sadly and told Daddy that this kind of thing happens to kids who have been through trauma. I didn’t know that word. One of them handed Daddy a business card and told him to call the number and set up an appointment for me.

I went to see Dr. Schumann after that. She was a nice lady. She was young and pretty. Her wall had a picture of a sailboat on it and I looked at the sailboat while we were talking.
  
	

“Can you tell me a little about yourself, Charlie?” she asked me.
  
	

“Well… I’m 7. I like watching TV…” I ran out of things to say about myself really fast.
  


“Okay, well, your parents tell me that you’ve been scared a lot recently. Can you tell me why?”
  
	

I looked up at her and I tried to figure out what she would think if I told her the truth. It was almost like she read my mind.
  
	

“You can tell me anything you like Charlie. I can’t tell anybody else, and I won’t think you’re crazy. I promise.”
  
	

I nodded and looked at the sailboat again. It made me feel better. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was because of the colors in the picture. “A bad man is trying to hurt me,” I said, quietly.
  
	

“Who is the bad man?” Dr. Schumann asked.
  
	

“He says he’s called the ‘Gratitude Doctor.’ He says he’s going to hurt my parents and my sister because I don’t appreciate them.”
  
	

Dr. Schumann nodded and wrote something down. “When was the first time you saw the Gratitude Doctor?” she asked.
  
	

“I saw him at the mall a few days ago,” I said. Then I told her all about the mall and my friends and the walk home and the picture and seeing him with the police. Doctor Schumann made a lot of notes and looked at me when I was done, and I could tell she was sad.
  
	

“Charlie, I don’t think you’re crazy. I think you have a big imagination, and I think a lot of scary things have happened to you. Do you think it’s possible you don’t remember all of these things right?”
  
	

I looked at my feet. That was what I was afraid she would say. She wasn’t going to help me figure out a way to get rid of the Gratitude Doctor. She didn’t know what was happening to me. 
  
	

She wrote something down on a piece of paper and handed it to me. “This is a prescription. I think this medicine might make the Gratitude Doctor go away. Try it and tell me what happens, okay?” I nodded and looked down at the paper. 
  
	

When I saw Daddy in the waiting room I handed him the paper and he looked at it and his forehead wrinkled. 
  
	

“She wants you to go on Clozapine? Is she sure about this?”
  
	

As Daddy was going to talk to Dr. Schumann, I turned to look at the people in the waiting room. There were all kinds of people there – young people, old people, women, men, short, tall. One man looked up at me from the paper he was reading. I looked back at him, curious.
  
	

“Are you being a good boy, Charlie?” the man asked.
  
	

I didn’t know what to say.
  
	

“I said *are you being a good boy, Charlie*?” the man asked again, and his face became dark and cloudy and he stood up and up and up from the chair until he was standing way over me, like a skyscraper.
  
	

“*Yes!*” I shouted at him, shaking.
  
	

“*You ungrateful little bitch!*” he shouted, spitting the last word out at me like a piece of pork he’d bitten into before waiting for it to cool down. “You don’t deserve a family. You don’t deserve a home. Everyone’s given you everything and you’ve fucked it up. You’ll grow up alone and nice, normal people will all avoid you or want to beat the shit out of you, just like Paul! You think Paul’s a bully? Paul’s doing the world a favor. Next time he should just beat the living snot out of you and not stop until you die right there!” He was shouting all of this at me, but nobody seemed to notice. He was so angry it was scary, because I didn’t understand what I’d done to make him so mad. Why did he hate me so much?
  
	

“I’m sorry!” I shouted at him. “I’m so sorry!”
  
	

Daddy came running back into the room, and put a hand on my shoulder. “What is it, Charlie?” he asked, frightened.
  
	

“The-the-the” I stammered, but I couldn’t say a whole sentence. By then, the Gratitude Doctor had disappeared. Dr Schumann came back out and tried to calm me down too. She tried to tell me the Gratitude Doctor wasn’t real. She had me breathe real deep and slow, and I started to feel a little better. But, then, I saw him over her shoulder. He was standing right behind her and Daddy, smiling and holding Rosie’s bloody head. In his other hand he held a sign, written in her blood, that read: “Are you being a good boy?”
  
	

I screamed so loud everyone in the room turned to look at me. I didn’t even notice and I kept screaming and pointing at the Gratitude Doctor. But he wasn’t there anymore. There was no bloody head, or sign, or anything. I fell onto the ground and curled up into a ball, holding my hands over my ears and eyes and shaking so hard I thought I might pass out.
  
	

“Yes!” I shouted. “I am being a good boy! Yes! I’m being grateful! What more do you want from me?” I was screaming at the top of my lungs and I kept screaming until my throat hurt too much to scream anymore.
