I don’t really know how this kind of thing works. Do I ask for advice? It probably wouldn’t do me much good now anyway. I guess the best way to start talking about this, is to first talk about my friend.

She was a pretty successful executive in the music industry and she was about to make the biggest jump in her career. She had a job lined up to essentially run an up-and-coming label. She bought a house by the time she was 26, she was the youngest female executive at her label and she was engaged. Her life was set.

I had known her since college. We were pretty wild back then. Trying to figure out ourselves and the world. You know how that is. I think we both imagined a pretty big future for ourselves. We had a weird, sort of competitive relationship. Both trying to out-fox the other and trying to get as far ahead as possible. It was harmless I think, it was mostly just related to banter.

I’ll be honest, we have shared the same bed and we even shared sexual partners before. We were both pretty open-minded about that kind of thing. I don’t think any of it ever got in the way of our friendship.

She met her fiancé right out of college. They were both working their way up their respective fields and they shared similar backgrounds. They were both foster kids and I think there’s a lot to kind of unpack about that. They were both there for each other at a time when they both really needed it.I always liked Mark. I even told her once I thought he was kind of cute. I don’t think she was too happy about that. He was sweet to her and he brought out a side of her that I hadn’t really ever known. Stability.

I’ll be honest, I don’t subscribe to the idea of monogamous relationships. I don’t really believe in them. Honestly, I’m not even sure that love is real. It all just seems contractual to me. So I’d rather cut out the bullshit about feelings and warmth and comfort. We can watch a movie and we can have dates and we can even fuck. I just don’t want the house with the white picket fence. I don’t even want your kids.

I just don’t think I have it in me to be anyone's wife.

So it was pretty surprising that Amber did. She wanted a family and I honestly can’t blame her. I had one and by the time I moved out, I wanted nothing to do with them. It’s funny how things like that shape your whole worldview. We were kind of perfect opposites.Amber could be the most exhilarating conversationalist. She was exciting and spontaneous and also thoughtful and sincere. She was so incredibly ambitious and it was awe-inspiring to watch her blossom. The funny thing is, she always smelled like lavender.

From the very depths of my soul, I feel it even in my bones, I hate Eve Wilkins.

Eve was a temp working at Mark’s company. I’ve heard both sides of the story, but from what I gathered she was a friend to Mark and nothing else. The issue was never about stealing Mark or trying to pry him away from her. It was a sick kind of twisted jealousy of a life Amber had fought tooth and nail for.You see, Eve was also kind of an orphan. From what I heard, she ran away from home. Her mom had started to lose it and Eve had become her victim. So I guess Mark saw himself in her a little I think. Maybe he just wanted to support the new intern who just moved here from out of state.

I don’t really buy that though. I love Mark, but men are men. That’s all I’ll really say about that.

There were so many stories about the events leading up to it. Something about a threesome, some story about Amber being cornered in the parking lot of her job. I can’t really speak to the events leading up to Amber’s death, cause I wasn’t there.

I was there the day it happened though.

Eve had strolled in like she had the ever-living shit beaten out of her. Cutting through the crowd of people at our friend's house. I still don’t understand something about it. Amber didn’t yell for someone to kick her out, she went in for a hug instead. I didn’t see it actually happen. A crowd had formed around them by the time Amber approached her.I did see Eve get up off the floor, as the guests all started to run and scream in panic. She was covered in Amber’s blood with what looked like a dagger made of bone. She just looked empty, I guess is the best way to describe it. Like something was missing. She just calmly walked to the bathroom, shut the door, and waited for the police to arrive.

I still have nightmares about it.

She stabbed her nineteen times. Eight times in her abdomen, six across her chest, and five to the face.

We shouldn’t have gone, but Mark wanted to see her face-to-face. We went to see Eve in prison. He had asked me to tag along as emotional support. I also wanted to look her in the eyes and see what she had to say. She looked frail and almost pathetic chained up by her wrists and ankles. This tiny little twig of a woman. They chained her to the table and waited on the other side of the door.We didn’t talk for at least the first five minutes. We just sat there in this pool of shame and anger and resentment I felt between all of us.

She asked about the house. Specifically what Mark was going to do with Amber’s house. Like that was any of her fucking business. I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.The hardest part about seeing Eve was that during the entire time she was being arrested she wanted everyone to believe she thought she was Amber. This was just another part of that, I guess. Insanity plea. Figures.“

What happens to the house has nothing to do with you, Eve.

”“Don’t call me that.”

“That’s your name. Eve.” I wanted to rub it in her face as much as I could.

“Are you two fucking? Jeez Kara, I knew you had a jealousy streak when it came to me but I never thought you’d take it that far. I thought we were beyond that catty shit.”

“You don’t know anything about my friendship with Amber, so stop pretending you do.”

“Don’t I? Come on Kar. You know what, I get it. It’s easier not to believe me cause if it were true you’d have to confront some nasty shit about the way you treated me. Right Mark?”

I got right up to her face and said, “Fuck you!”

She grabbed me by the hair and slammed my head onto the steel table. I think she even ripped a chunk of my hair out. The guards quickly rushed into the room and restrained her. Almost carrying her out of the room. I wiped as much of the blood as I could from my nose. Her last words before the door closed behind her were, “I’ll be seeing you, Kara.”

So yeah, I’m fucking Mark. It’s in the title, so it shouldn’t be a surprise. Before you judge, I just want you to know, I didn’t want any of this shit.

You should have seen Mark at the funeral. He sat alone toward the back. He’d grown out his beard and it wasn’t a stylistic choice. He’d stop taking care of himself. You could even see it in his eyes, he hadn’t been getting much sleep.

Some time later I thought I’d check in on him. I knew from a friend of a friend that he was supposed to be staying at Paul’s. His best friend. Turns out he moved out pretty quickly after Amber died. Paul was nice enough to point me in the right direction. It was an old sort of run-down motel. It was the best he could afford, he said.I had to generously tip the woman at the front desk for Mark’s room number. When I did finally get there, he looked worse than I imagined. I could smell the liquor in his breath. Papers were all strewn about on the bed and floor. Stacks of beer bottles lined up the TV cabinet. So when he opened the door, I immediately hugged him.

He looked like how I felt.

Mark was in the middle of some kind of dispute with the state regarding common law. He was trying to prove that because he’d lived with Amber for over six years, he was technically already married to her. That the house should be put in his name. So in the meantime, he’d been staying at the Triple Oak Motel.

I couldn’t let him stay there in the state he was in. He was bound to drink himself to death. So I offered him the chance to come with me. He could stay the night at my place and we could have a nice dinner. I really needed someone to talk to that would get it. I think he needed that too.

So when we got back to mine, I very graciously asked him to shower and to please shave. He looked like shit. A few drinks in and a couple of dumplings later, well yeah. It just sort of happened. I don’t think I was secretly harboring feelings for Mark or trying to swoop in on my best friend’s man. It was sort of like a pity fuck. Okay, not entirely. I’m not going to sit here and say that it wasn’t nice to have someone to grieve with. To have someone to cry with and yeah someone to fuck.

Can you blame me?

That was a few months ago. I let Mark stay with me while he figured out the situation with the house. I’d be lying if I said that things weren’t kind of great. That is until we went to see Eve. After that, it felt like everything changed. He got paranoid and distant, I couldn’t recognize him in this state. So frantic for answers. It felt like Eve got in his head.

Mark had the idea to go to Amber’s house. He still had a way in and he wanted to sort through some of her things. See if he could get some answers about her last few weeks. So of course I tagged along. I just wanted to make sure he didn’t go off the deep end.

It was weird to be back there without her. Her empty mug was still sitting at her desk. Her laptop was open on the kitchen table. There was dust everywhere. I sat on the couch while he scoured through her laptop and her search history. He pulled up videos he found of some shaman online. A strange video of cryptids and paranormal things. It was pretty creepy and it didn’t seem like something that Amber would all be interested in.

Then there was a video of something called a Deadeye. They linked it to Lilith, Adam’s first wife. Called her the origin of envy, the spirit of greed and spite. How they fashioned the myth of the wendigo out of it. That it could take many forms and that it could inflict a type of psychosis on its victims. Push them to steal, kill, and even in some cases cannibalism. All of it in the effort to spread the infection, I think. I know it was something like that.

It all just seemed like a bunch of horse shit to me.

I don’t think Mark got the answers he was looking for, just more questions. After that, it just felt like something was off. In bed, he’d gotten more forceful, and aggressive. All of it was still consensual. It just made me feel, I don’t know, nauseous I guess. It’s hard to describe like my stomach was turning over. Maybe he was resentful of this thing we have between us now. That we, in his head, had betrayed Amber. He clearly stopped caring about the way he presented himself to me.I’d lived with Amber here for the first four years after college. So I was very aware of some of her least attractive habits. Like how she’d stack flattened-out candy wrappers on top of each other in this neat pile. Then she’d leave them on the coffee table. Or how she would go out of her way to share the same towel with me. Sometimes I thought she did it just to annoy me.

So when I started seeing these habits, it was like having flashbacks. Shellshock from a thing I was trying to forget. He did other things too. He stopped contributing to the house chores. He was so aggressive and standoffish with me sometimes. He used to cook a lot for us, then he just stopped out of nowhere. I had such a hard time reconciling this person with whom I had been living with before.

It felt like I was living with a stranger. Then things got weirder.

I had this dream that I was running through some woods barefoot. It was the middle of the night and I crouched down behind some bushes. I could hear rustling just a short distance away. I felt animalistic. A deep unsatiated hunger. Something primal. Something pure. I leaped out of this bush and in my hands I caught this little fat rabbit. It squirmed and squealed in fear. Then I cracked its neck and started eating it raw.

The strange thing is when I woke up, I couldn’t find my clothes.

I was cleaning one morning and all of a sudden I just felt this urge. I know that I shouldn’t have but I couldn’t help feeling like he was hiding something. At first, I just searched the dressers. Then his luggage and when I couldn’t find anything I went under the bed. I found this little shoe box tucked away in a corner, under the side he slept on. I opened it and found a bunch of women’s jewelry. Rings, bracelets, necklaces. There were also little pieces of folded paper with little love notes written inside of them.I recognized one of the necklaces, it was Amber’s. It was this pretty little heart-shaped thing. She used to wear it all the time in college. It’d been years since I saw it. The rest of the stuff in there didn't really seem like it was Amber’s style.

I went into the city to see some friends of mine. I needed some time away from the house and a few good drinks would do me well. We were gonna have brunch, maybe turn into a thing. You know what I saw? That little jackass walking out of my favorite brunch spot with this tiny little thing. Here’s the thing, I shouldn’t care. I should give a flying fuck what he does, this was not what I was looking for. Still, when he got home we argued for hours. He had to talk me off the ledge. What is happening to me, I’m not this person.

Here’s the kicker, as he’s making up with me, he has me stand by my mirror. He came up from behind me, pulled out a necklace, and placed it around my neck. Can you guess which one it was?

That night something had startled me out of sleep. The lights were all off and there was barely any moonlight shining in through the windows. I saw something at the corner of my bed. A figure of some sort standing there. Watching me. I could only see its almost pale gray eyes looking at me. It never blinked, almost like a corpse. I tried to bury myself under the covers and hoped that I was imagining things, but I'm not so sure.

The next day I did something I shouldn’t have. I went to see Eve a second time. This time when they brought her in she looked defeated. It was counter to the way she handled herself before. She waited silently until the guards left the room. Then she grabbed my hands and I could see genuine fear in her eyes. I pull my hands away, like a recoil.

“What are you doing, Eve?”

She said her name was Kristen-something. That she was a corrections officer. Eve had been violent with her during a routine inspection. A few days later she was brought into holding while someone who looked just like her was let go. She didn’t realize it until much later that Eve had somehow switched their appearances. They thought she was Eve trying to make a run for it.

She begged me for a pen and paper and then she proceeded to write down an address for me. She begged me to check in on this house.“Please, I need to know that my husband and daughter are safe.”God dammit. I just wanted confirmation that Mark had slept with Eve and this is what I get. Fuck me.

Yeah, yeah I went to see the house and you know what? It had been burned down. That’s all I needed at this point. More of Eve’s little mind games.

I had another dream that night. I was again in the woods walking towards this clearing. A giant fire pit in the middle of this circle. There were women on all sides, naked, dragging pigs and goats and sheep from out of the tree line. I noticed that so was I. I had a rope fashioned around this fat pig's neck. There were these tribal drums banging to this haunting rhythm. One woman stood tall in the back. She had no offering. She was tan with beautiful brown hair and eyes that were pure black. Then she screamed. It was this haunting, blood-curdling screech. We all slit the throats of our offerings and then proceeded to slather their blood across our naked bodies. Then when she stopped screaming she made large gashes across her skin with a knife. We rushed to gather around her to lick the blood from her body. When I woke up I felt this tender layer of flesh around my wrists and ankles. It was almost like burns.

The house was a mess. It seemed like Mark had invited some people over without asking me. There were beer bottles everywhere. The floors were sticky. I spent most of the day cleaning it up. By the time I was done my back hurt. I was exhausted and I felt so horribly dehumanized. He barely said hi as he walked into the house. Instead, he picked me up and dropped me onto the bed like I was his plaything. He got on top of me and ripped my clothes off. I barely had the energy to say no. I did consent, I just wish I had more time and energy to more formally do so. He thrust and I felt him. He puts his hands lightly around my throat. It was dark now and my mind wandered. I swear I could hear the sound of rhythmic drumming getting louder and louder. In the corner, I saw that figure standing at the edge of the bed watching us. His hands got tighter around my throat. He leaned into my ear and whispered, “You like that?”

You know what I smelled? Lavender.

His hands got tighter and now I felt myself losing air. Struggling to breathe. The drumming had overtaken my senses. I don’t know how I knew to reach underneath my pillow. Or why there was a knife stashed there. I don’t even remember doing it. Like I had the memory of the thing and not the presence of mind during it. I had slit his throat and as he struggled with the wound I gutted him open. I let him bleed onto me and I couldn’t help but laugh. I cackled even in the pure ecstasy of my laughter.

And you know what? I don’t even feel bad. I’m nobody's bitch.
