I want to start this off with the simple fact that I don’t believe in ghosts, at least I didn’t, I’m not sure anymore. Sorry, let me give you a quick background of my situation. Have you ever found yourself making your way into a gas station at the edge of town and turned your gaze towards the sleep deprived clerk quietly minding his business? Well shit, you may have met me.



I work the overnight shift at my local gas station, sitting between abandoned dilapidated buildings and a stretch of flourishing forests, the road between being the only connector to these two opposites of life. Now I’m sure you’re probably asking “That sounds pretty sketchy, why would you work there?” I know because I asked myself the same thing, but the pay isn’t bad and being a broke twenty year old didn’t suit me.



The owners aren’t bad people, just distant. In my three months of working here I’ve only spoken to them a handful of times, the interview process felt weird too, all I got was a phone call asking if I wanted the job and if I could work the hours? Of course I answered yes (who wouldn’t) and only a few days later I found myself at the front counter with a list of instructions and to do’s. 



The interior was nothing special if I’m being honest, shelves of overpriced candy and canned goods with a set of coolers lining the side wall. Then there was me, sat up at my desk next to the front door with a squeaky old chair and a cash register that always seems to wanna get stuck every four transactions. With all that being said you would assume that I hate my job, but I don’t. It’s extremely quiet, I only get a handful of customers a night and they usually keep to themselves, I grew to think of the insulation as a small perk of the job. But something happened last night that….I just need someone else to hear.



1:48 a.m. 



Leaning back in my chair, I sat making my way through the latest book in my backlog when I heard the familiar ding coming from the front door. Placing my book down I stood up to face the man who had entered the store, the best way I could describe him was the stereotypical trucker. Boots, blue jeans, Carhartt jacket and a big beard, yet he was clean without a single speck of dirt on him. 

  


“Evening Sir, what can I do for you?” Giving him my best “I’m tired, just tell me what you want and leave” greeting I could muster.



“Oh nothin much, just give me twenty on the diesel for pump four.” Reaching into his pocket he pulled out a twenty dollar bill handing it to me, as I entered in the information on my keypad he spoke again. “I’d recommend you stay safe out here, I’ve heard stories of weird things happening around here. Wouldn’t want anything bad to happen.”



Raising my eyebrow I glanced over at him to see if he was threatening me, but no, he just stood there waiting for me to give him the ok.  “I appreciate the advice, but I’ve never seen anything out of the ordinary over here. I’d say your sources are feeding you lies.” Handing him his receipt he chuckled as he made his way out of the store and within a couple minutes he was gone. 



2:08 a.m.



Another ding resounded in my ears, placing my book back down. I stood up and identified the new customer. That’s when things started taking a weird turn, the same man from a half hour ago stood in front of me, same boots, same jeans, same jacket, same everything. However this time his jeans were lined with small patches of dirt, as confused as I was I  decided to leave it alone and just do my job.



“Evening sir, what can I do for you?” Standing in front of my counter, I could feel his eyes digging burrows through me, luckily I didn’t have to wait long for my answer.



“Oh nothin much, just give me twenty on the diesel for pump four.” Handing me a twenty dollar bill as he finished, wanting him out as soon as possible I quickly entered everything in on my register and handed him his receipt.



“I’d recommend you stay safe out here, I’ve heard stories of weird things happening around here. Wouldn’t want anything bad to happen.” Having my fair share of this guy's ominous bull shit, I decided to not encourage this conversation. “Ya man…I hear you.” With that he made his way out and I tried to return to my book, getting my mind off of this weird customer.

  
  
  


2:38 a.m.



Once again the ring of the front door pulled my attention and almost as if on cue he was back, but something was off this time. It looked as though as if he’d just crawled out of a grave with dirt and residue coating his whole body and if that wasn’t enough he had thick cuts across his arms and face, however no blood leaked out of the gashes. Deciding I’d had enough of this charade I shouted at the man, in hindsight that probably wasn’t the best idea, but can you blame me?



“Alright man what the hell happened to you!? This is your third time here and it looks like you took a quick detour into the local swamp!”



Pointing at him in fury or fear I wasn’t quite sure, I looked him dead in the eyes. But that was easily my worst mistake, his eyes were milky as if someone drowned out the color in them. Retracting my hand I couldn’t help the gulp retreating down my throat, hell I wish I could too.



As he opened his mouth his jaw produced a wretched cracking before producing noise. “Oh nothin much, just give me twenty on the diesel for pump four.”



As if robotic he reached out and handed me another bill, I could see more cuts and bruises on his fingers. Gingerly I reached out and snatched the bill from his hand and began to enter it into my register, my heart sank and I felt a frigid chill crawl up my spine as I noticed the small popup on the screen.



“Pump new balance: forty dollars.”

  


I began to sweat as my brain turned in my head, panicking. I jerked my head towards the window facing the lot, to my horror no truck sat anywhere outside. I slowly turned my head back to the man, as I made eye contact his face twisted into a horrifying smile producing cracked teeth.



“I’d recommend you stay safe out here, I’ve heard stories of weird things happening around here. Wouldn’t want you to join the rest.” At this point I was frozen in fear, my voice left me to fend for myself as all I could do was stare at this “man” standing in front of me. It felt as though we stood there for minutes before I finally built up the courage to say something.



“Y-You don’t say….” Giving him my own wary smile he turned on his feet making his way out the store moving out of my line of sight. Without a moment to think I collapsed on the chair, my breathing felt haggard as I tried to steady myself from what the hell I just experienced. After a moment I checked my phone for the time. It read two forty. “Two minutes?” I screamed in my head, how the hell could it have just been two minutes? Lowering my head, I just decided to surrender myself to this weirdness and tried to brush it back into my mind to finish my shift, but I wasn’t so lucky.

  


3:08 a.m.



I was in the backroom looking for some stock to put out as the ding rang out from the front. Flinching, I couldn’t help but think back to that man, was he back? Sighing as I accepted my fate, I walked out to the front. What awaited me however wasn’t what I expected, I’m still not sure what it was either. It looked like a tall man around six foot five, he was dressed in a long black trench coat with a hood thrown over his head. I tried to look into his face, but all I was met with was a deep dark abyss, it felt as if I was looking at nothing at all. Whatever it was, it quickly made its way to the register and placed a thin white slip of paper on the counter before leaving as quickly as it had arrived.



However weary I was of the contents of this note, I couldn’t help the curiosity sprouting in my brain, so I opened it. The note contained only two words written in a soft thin cursive. 



“You passed” Passed? Passed what? Staring down at the paper I didn’t understand what it meant, did I pass some type of challenge? Maybe a game? I honestly didn’t know. That’s when the familiar ring of the door gave me a slight heart attack.



“Landon! How’s it going bro?” It was Tyler, my best friend who I just about wanted to strangle to death for the scare he just gave me. After calming down I explained what just happened and I could tell he didn’t believe me.



“O.K. man, how about I stay with you for the rest of your shift so you don’t see any more spooky ghosts.” Laughing as he finished I took him up on the offer and the night flew by without anything else happening. 



When the opener finally came in I quickly gathered my stuff before making my way towards the door, however he stopped me before I made it out.



“Oh ya be careful on your way home, apparently some dude crashed into a ditch last night. You never know what kind of people are on the road.” I went pale, slowly turning back towards him and cleared my throat. “Uh, you wouldn’t know what kind of car the guy was driving would you?”



Seconds passed like minutes as I could see him thinking. “Ya, I think they were saying a big pickup truck or something like that.” I could feel sweat fall down my face after hearing that, nodding. I made my way to my car and rushed home. 



I’ve been home ever since, still trying to wrap my head around everything that occurred last night, nonetheless I have work again tonight and after all that I’m not game to just sit idly by and just wait for whatever’s going on at the gas station to come and get me. 



I’m gonna go in a little early tonight and ask the guy who’s closing if he’s ever seen anything out of the ordinary, I’m hoping he may have some insight for me. If you have any idea of what might be happening please let me know. I’ll hopefully come back and be able to give closure to this whole ordeal, however if I don't… assume the worst.
