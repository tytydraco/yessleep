Everyday when I'd get home from school I'd hear the screaming of my parents in the next room, it drove me insane.

My name is Akemi, but my friends like to call me "koi fish"
Ever since we moved from Japan things started to get hell like. 

All my parents did were, have sex and yell at each other. When we lived in Japan everything was... not the best, but better then now. 

My father had a history of being a rapist and my mother 
never reported him. 

She was a victim of him. 

What he didn't know was she had Stockholm syndrome. 

I hated living.

I just wanted to end it all

To see if they really loved me

I remember the first time I burnt myself 

Purposely 

It felt like I was finally free from this place

What I didn't know was how hard it was to hide it

When my dad found out I fell apart..
"YOU MOTHEFUCKER! YOU DID THIS YOURSELF YOU FUCKING WHORE??" He held my arm up to show my mom "YOU'RE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO THIS FAMILY" he 
grabbed a knife. 

I stood like a duck

"YOU WANT TO HURT YOURSELF? ILL DO IT FOR YOU!"
with that he started to cut my arm

I tried to run.
But with every movement he cut deeper
Till I finally gave my last movement to grabbing the knife and stabbing him with all my might

My mother ran to grab me but before she could even move I stabbed her as hard as I could.

I looked down at their bleeding corpses.

"I'm hungry" I thought 
As soon as that thought crossed my head I bent down. 

It felt like I hadn't eaten in years.

I took bite of my mother's arm

He blood seeped into my mouth with a horrible iron taste

I didn't care

I was hungry 

When I was done I throw them down too the basement

I wake up remembering that I had the house all to myself

I get up and grab my lighter

Just incase

I thought 

I walked down stairs to a rope sitting with a note on the 
counter which read 

"YOU CANT RUN FOREVER"
with that I took the rope and went outside
I looked beautiful

No one had to know what happened to my parents 

The clouds were covering the sun

Finally 

FINALLY!

I AM FREE

I tied the rope right around my neck 
"FINALLY!"
I knocked myself off of the tree branch. 
The last thing I heard was
"Oyasumi."

I wake up to a painful gasp 

Im in a forest?
Every branch was covered in ropes
With people on them
Walking closer to them I noticed that there were notes on them. 

All of them said
"THEY MADE THE SAME MISTAKE AS YOU"
Written in blood

CRIST I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END THIS
it's not the best but I tried
