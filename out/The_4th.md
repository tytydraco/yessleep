My Friday night had ultimately started like any other. Get home from work, exhausted, get changed, and get into bed. I had planned to do nothing, stick to my schedule, but I figured I should check my phone before I tuned out the rest of the world. To my surprise, Wally, one of my few close friends, had left me a message 



“We’re having drinks at ours tonight, you should come” This wasn’t out of the ordinary by any means, however, my response to it was. Maybe getting out of the house and spending time with people I actually like, instead of my coworkers whose biggest passions were collecting magnets, would do me some good. I shot back “Who’s gonna be there?” 



“Not many of us, just Sharon, Blake, and I.”



‘Perfect’ I thought to myself, not too big, no strangers, a situation I could actually relax in.  

“Alright, I’ll be ‘round soon.” I responded again with an unfamiliar swiftness, before getting into slightly more presentable clothes than sweatpants and a t-shirt covered in stains. Their apartment was within walking distance, and on the way, I swung into the liquor store and bought a bottle of whisky. I’d rather drink this shit straight than let beer touch my tongue. I gave their 4th-floor apartment door a solid knock and waited, Sharon greeting me at the door with her usual warm demeanor, I’d known her for longer than the other two, and I always knew she’d save a seat for me.

“Oh my god Jared! It’s been a while right?” I stepped inside as she closed the door behind me

“Yeah, it certainly has been, works’ been keeping me busy.” I sighed out, the end of the sentence punctuated with a chuckle laced with sadness and monotony. 

Sharon and Wally's place was just as small as I remembered it being the last time I was here, with the entire place only being about 20 meters across, with a wall cutting through the centre dividing the living room and kitchen from the 2 bedrooms on either side of the bathroom. At least all three of those rooms could be passed through one to the other, making it feel like the place had more space than it did. I trotted over to the couch, brown paper bag in hand, and took a seat next to my buddy on the couch “What’s up Blake?” I said casually as my gaze shifted towards the TV across from us. “What’re we watchin’?” I again asked, awaiting a response. Silence. Finally, the person beside me responded “Dude. Seriously?” Ah. I’d made *that* mistake again, turning slowly, my eyes met Barry “Shit sorry dude!” I chortled out, much more genuinely this time. Blake and Wally had always looked eerily similar, like brothers, especially when I first met the pair a few years back, I would mix them up constantly, and make plenty of jokes claiming one of their mothers had cheated on one of their fathers, and I hadn’t seen either in at least 3 months. They both sported the same blue eyes, same height, same brown tousled hair, same nose, and the same toothy, giddy grins.



“Honestly I thought we looked different enough now that this wouldn’t still happen.” I quite literally pointed and laughed at him, in response “All you’ve done to differentiate your appearances, is wear slightly different styles of clothing.”



“Nuh-uh! We have totally different hairstyles now!” They really didn’t. His defensiveness elicited another chuckle from me. I already felt like I’d laughed more tonight than I had in a good, long while. “Sure man, sure, I’ll just make the judgement myself whenever Blake gets here.”

As if he’d been waiting for a cue, a loud flush came from behind the door next to the TV, and with a boisterous step out of the bathroom, Blake appeared “Shit, speak of the devil.” Blake responded to my quip with excitement, that aforementioned wide, goofy smile spreading across his face as he realised I was here “Shit Jared I had no idea you’d be here tonight! Let’s go!” He quickly made his way over to the couch plopping down between myself and Carson “Tonight’s gonna be sick as now!” Both Carson and I stared at him in silence before I spoke “We’re a bunch of 20-somethings drinking in an apartment man, try to set your expectations pretty low.” This elicited a good laugh from the others “Well with you guys as my friends my expectations can’t go much lower.” 



“Wooow, okay I see how it is, now that feels like a challenge!” I said as I cracked the lid off my whisky and poured a foolhardy amount of the stinging liquor down my throat, a tinge of regret filling me before quickly being replaced by the warmth spreading from my stomach. Hearing my anguished breath, Sharon quickly joined us sitting on a nearby bean bag “Oh finally, I was wondering when we’d start!” 



With that, we all started happily drinking, the minutes turning to hours as we shot the shit, played a few games, and I simply reconnected with my friends. Truth be told I had missed this, missed seeing Carson and Blake teasing and prodding each other like little brothers, while Sharon watched and laughed, and I interjected by adding fuel to the fire when I could, of course. Things were going so smoothly, that I completely lost track of time, much like everyone else, and by the time I checked, it was already 1 in the morning. 

“Ahh shit it’s getting really late guys, I should probably get going…” Carson, with slightly slurred words, said “Whaaat, come on dude, you can just, like, just stay here we have that spare room over there for a reason!” He said gesturing over to the door closest to the balcony. I was considering the proposal for a second before my thoughts were cut short by the seemingly, even more drunk Blake “Wait, wait, if Jared gets to stay, so do I!” Sharon rolled her eyes and responded, “Yeah we assumed you’d just take the couch dude…” 

“Alright, so it’s settled then! Sleepover is happening tonight!” Carson quickly spouted, throwing his arms around Blake and Sharon. I hadn’t even made my decision, but it seemed like it’d been made for me. We drank for another couple of hours, before everyone was either too sloshed or too tired to continue, everyone retreating to their respective locations. Blake, remaining on the couch, Sharon and Carson moving back towards their room, myself nearly falling in the small distance between the couch and the wooden sliding door protecting the room I would make mine for the night. I didn’t even bother drawing the curtains shut as I finally got comfortable in the bed I was assigned. 



However, something felt off, and it wasn’t hard to place my finger on what, even in my inebriated state. It was quiet, sickeningly quiet, I knew it was 3 in the morning, but even so, the city seemed so still. I couldn’t hear the sounds of passing traffic, of distant sirens, of a crackhead spouting nonsense. I chalked the strange atmosphere up to my current blood-alcohol levels, along with the fact I hadn’t slept in a bed other than my own in a very long time, and tried to ignore it. The next couple hours I slept without too much issue, that was, of course, other than the odd dreams that perforated my serene slumber. Images of foul, shadowy, man-adjacent specters, walking the gloomy streets of the city and ensuring no one was out after the curfew these very creatures had imposed with their presence. 



My dreams were torn from my sleep-addled mind in an instant, as a single sound finally sawed the silence that had blanketed the world so stealthily. I was groggy from a combination of restless sleep and whisky, but my sobriety was quickly regained as I realised the noise wasn’t coming from outside, it was the sound of the sliding door to my room, slowly, being wrenched open. My heartbeat swiftened, as I propped my back up on the headboard, my eyes adjusting to the darkness too slowly for my liking as they remained trained on the painfully slow parting door. It stopped quickly as it was almost halfway, the pale, dull moonlight filtering through the window, my only illumination. 



“Hello?” As soon as the words left my mouth, I felt like an idiot. If this was some dumb prank being played on me, which wasn’t necessarily out of the norm, I would have just sounded like some scared, wimpy kid. I really wish I was getting pranked. Because a second later, the outline of someone - or, something, came into the moon-light. My heart dropped further into my stomach, the terror I was currently feeling, the goosebumps riddling my skin, the deafening quiet as I tried not to breathe, none of it made sense, because I recognized who was standing at my door, it was Wally. 



“Seriously? Man this is not the fucking time for this, I’m tired and this is actually pissing me off.” The anger I was trying to portray was betrayed by the slight quiver in my voice, anyone could tell I wasn’t feeling any rage, just fear. The deadly silence fell again after my words broke it, only for a few seconds before all I could hear was my own heart-beat, as Carson edged slightly closer. I would have screamed then if I could, but the silence felt indomitable, as if I wasn’t allowed to even think about breaking it. That was, because I could see him just slightly better, as more of the moonlight washed over him like some accursed spot-light, he, the performer, my terror, his applause. He was smiling, a very genuine smile. Filled with so much joy it looked like it threatened to burst at the seams and tear further than his face allowed. So wide, it was like a silent scream, or as if he was threatening to devour my very existence. His pristine teeth glistened like wet rocks jutting from a placid lake. My eyes hesitantly met his, and I could see his overwhelming glee portrayed through them as well. The corners of his eyes turned with the contour of his maw, yet they remained wide, wide enough to soak in every minute detail of the undeniable terror that was no doubt written on my sweat-soaked face. We stayed locked in this silent stand-still exchange of stares, either perspective coming from wholly different places. He wouldn’t move his eyes, he was looking at me how one might look at their truest love or the most splendid sunset they’d see their entire life, why would someone tear their eyes from that? I however, *couldn’t* move my eyes, not if I wanted to. Because if I did, I couldn’t track him anymore, I couldn’t be sure, he wasn’t getting closer to me. 



So there we stayed, for what felt like an eternity, the silence swirling and mixing with my seething dread to create a void of time and space. But we couldn’t stay like that forever, I refused to stay like that forever. So, with a shaky inhale being the first noise I’d heard in who knows how long, I prepared to speak “Hey-” I could hardly get the word out before I saw him move. Slowly. Deliberately. His hand rose to his face, his gnarled, rotten, inhumanly long digits curling till only his index remained, and he pressed it to his gaping jaws, without breaking the oppressive quiet of this world he had made, he silenced me. I still can’t decipher whether this was a trick of the light, but I swore his unholy smile somehow grew wider still. Undoubtedly, too wide for any human being to muster, no, too wide for any creation in the light of god to muster. Then, before he, or it, lowered its hand once more, its euphoria-filled eyes finally blinked, but it did it absolutely wrong. Its eyelids, not even synced up to one another, covered the pits of joy and excitement vertically. This simple motion stirred me to even greater heights of panic, this wasn’t Wally, this wasn’t human, this was something no one should ever have the displeasure of knowing exists. 



My fear couldn’t hold me anymore, the panic and overwhelming human need to escape my demise took over as I shot out of bed, but even then, I simply couldn’t bring myself to scream. I couldn’t bring myself to disobey the one thing this creature had made clear it desired. 



As I rocketed up the creature moved in a shockingly fluid motion as if it was a rag-doll simply being pulled by some unseen force as it whipped around the doorway, its head lulling limply as the rest of its body flew from my vision, allowing its horrid visage to stay in my view for just a few more instances before I heard it move quickly, further into the apartment. I forced myself after it, into the living room, flicking on the light and seeing just a glimpse of its black, charcoal-like form leaving the empty, lifeless space and entering Sharon and Wally's room. Panic grasped me tighter than ever now, as I felt horror not out of fear for my survival, but for my friends. I raced to their room, passing the bathroom door and TV in a rush, ignoring the cold wind blowing from the open balcony door, not being careful in the slightest as I flicked the switch on in their room, bathing them in a stark blinding light, showing me an empty room other than my friends occupying the bed. Wally stirred from his slumber as Sharon lay sleeping beside him, sitting up in bed with a look of annoyance on his face. 



“What the fuck are you doing man?” He said with a slightly disoriented chuckle, still clearly a tad drunk and not looking concerned in the slightest. It was only then that I started to feel like an idiot again, I was incredibly drunk before going to sleep, I had a horrific nightmare, and Wally had decided to fuck with me. It was the perfect concoction of things to make me see shit, and to no doubt give Wally a good laugh, it was easy to rationalize everything. “What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck are you doing!? You scared the shit out of me man!” I barked, the anger more than evident in my voice, having quickly replaced the fear that had consumed me. “Dude, calm down, did you have a nightmare or something? You look super pale.” 



“No! Well, yeah I did, but I’m talking about you fucking around at my door being a weirdo!” Carson looked confused at that, sitting up slightly more as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “You must’ve been imagining things, I haven't gotten out of bed all night.” 



“Well I just saw you run back in here, and I know damn well it wasn’t Sharon, she wouldn’t do that kind of… weird shit!”



Then, I heard the toilet flush, the bathroom door open, and a gentle footfall coming towards their door. I looked back and saw Sharon “Oh hey Jared, did you need something?” As soon as she joined me at the door, it came back, or perhaps it’d be more accurate to say, it left. Silence. Crippling, excruciating, silence. An absence as large as the pit in my stomach. Swallowing my soul once more and grinding my brain between its invisible gnashing teeth. My gaze slowly shifted, from Sharon, to the figure curled up comfortably in bed next to Carson, its shape now rising and falling with a different rhythm, if as taking in more breaths to contain its own excitement. I lifted my finger to my lips, unintentionally mimicking this foul unnatural horror, ushering the others to be silent too. Carson's face mirrored my own, with a solid dose of confusion joining the dog pile of negative emotions.



Careful not to break the quiet, I ushered Carson to leave the room. Every movement, every measly breath and step, from Carson lifting the blankets to the few steps it took him to reach Sharon and I, felt like hell. We’d all been put in this guillotine, and it felt like one wrong step would cause the blade to drop on our chilled necks. Carson slid past me as I methodically closed the door, praying to all that was, that the door wouldn’t creak as I did. The snapping of the door's latch going into place sounded like a bomb going off right next to my head, but I let out a small sigh of relief as it did. 



“W-what’s going on?” Sharon croaked out in a shaky whisper as the three of us looked at each other, not wanting to add to my friend's fear and panic I responded “Someth- Someones in the apartment.” 



“Do you know them?” Wally questioned, whispering too, as we stepped slowly away from the bedroom door “No. No, I have no clue who that was, I thought it was you when I couldn’t see them much.” 

“Jesus Christ, do we call the cops?” Sharon asked clearly, trying her best to hold herself together as we made our way carefully to the couch and sat down. I knew that wouldn’t help, knew they couldn’t help, but agreed nonetheless. As the dial tone, which was far louder than our whispers, started to ring out from Sharon's phone, we heard movement, the shifting of blankets, of a bed creaking, it was deafening given the current state of affairs. 



Suddenly, the sliding door to the room I was in slammed shut, the resounding explosion of sound filling the apartment violently, causing all three of us to respond in kind with screams of our own. There was no silence now, only chaos. The sound of something banging and smashing violently, just beyond the three doors connecting the rooms opposing us, going from one side of the apartment to the other with the ferocity of a caged animal rampaging as the three of us remained in paralysed, hushed, silence just beyond it. There would be a violent rapping of a fist on my door, only for there to immediately be a rabid jostling of the door handle to Sharon and Wallys room, like it was pretending it couldn’t get in here whenever it pleased, and was doing so with the force of a freight train and the wrath of a charging bull.

We lived in this hell for what felt like hours, though in reality, it was probably only about 15 seconds. We lived in it, until the door in the center, the door to the bathroom, slowly started to open. We watched, wrapped in the crushing fist of feverish horror, as the door handle slowly arced down, before returning to rest as soon as the door was free from its hold. We watched, as second after second passed, and the door inched ever more open, revealing an all-consuming blackness beyond it. We stayed like that, staring into the abyss for another eternity, waiting for some acrid horror to burst forth and take us into its cavernous grin. Though nothing came. Sounds started to creep back into my mind, distant car horns, chittering pigeons, the sounds of life, of existing, here and now. Relief washed over me like a warm shower, and eventually, even a voice came, a terrified, quivering voice, from inside the bathroom “G-guys? Are any… Are any of you there?” 



In my state of violent panic, I’d completely forgotten about Blake, but that was his voice. I made my way carefully into the bathroom, still refusing to talk at a room-appropriate volume  “Blake? That you?” I heard a response from one of the bathroom storage closets, along with a sigh of relief 



“Oh thank fuck…” The closet door smoothly opened and a pale, sweaty, shaking Blake emerged, pulling me into a hug as he saw me “I genuinely thought I was gonna die, I was taking a piss and suddenly I heard all this smashing about in those guys' room, so I panicked and hopped in the closet.” I could only imagine how terrified he would have been, we at least had the walls dividing us, Blake had to be in here with that thing, but at least he didn’t have to see it. That was an eldritch dread only I had the misfortune of experiencing. 



“Yeah, we think someone broke in while we were all asleep.” Blake understandably looked more shaken up than any of us.



“Well, where the hell did he go?” Blake and I started carefully surveying the rooms, looking in every closet and under every bed, til I noticed, the guest bedroom window was wide open. I checked around the window carefully, feeling as if at any second that grotesque, withered hand would wrap around my neck and yank me from the building. I was relieved when I closed it, despite that… Thing, still being out there, in my city, the ordeal was over. Walking back into the living room, I informed the others about the intruder leaving through the window, despite the fact we were on the 4th floor. The rest of the morning we tried to make small talk while we cleaned, trying to make sure there wasn’t a second of quiet between us, but it was hard after the night we’d experienced. Eventually, we all parted ways, as I left the apartment I made sure to check on everyone individually, hoping that last night hadn’t affected them as it had me. I left my hug with Blake, patting his shoulder I said “I’m sorry you had to go through something so fucking scary man.” When I said that, I saw a subtle change on Blakes face, hardly enough to notice, the corners of his mouth were twisting ever so slightly, into a smile, a smile he was clearly trying to hold in “It’s all good man, not like I was the only one who got scared right?” I didn’t say another word to my friends as I quickly tried to leave, only looking back as I was waving goodbye, only for a second, and I could’ve sworn I saw Blake blink vertically.
