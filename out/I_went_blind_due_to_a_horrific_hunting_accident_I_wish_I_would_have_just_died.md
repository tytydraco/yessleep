The doctors told me it was a miracle that I survived. They said it was a one-in-a-million shot—a bullet that should have killed me instantly but somehow left me clinging to life. I remember the flash of pain, the darkness swallowing me whole, and then nothing. When I woke up in the hospital, everything was different. I was blind.

The hunting trip was supposed to be a weekend getaway with my friends, a chance to escape the monotony of daily life and enjoy the peace of the woods. We had been laughing, sharing old stories around the campfire, when I felt it. A sharp, searing pain exploded in my skull, and then everything went black.

When I finally regained consciousness, my world was shrouded in darkness. The doctors explained that the bullet had damaged my optic nerves irreparably. I would never see again. At first, I was consumed by rage and despair. How could this happen to me? But soon, other sensations crept in—things that made my blood run cold.

It started with the voices. At night, when the world was quiet, I would hear whispers, soft and indistinct. They seemed to come from just beyond the edges of my perception, always slipping away when I tried to focus on them. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, a side effect of the trauma. But the voices grew louder, more insistent.

“He’s coming,” they would say. “He sees you.”

I tried to ignore them, but the whispers followed me everywhere. During the day, I would feel cold fingers brushing against my skin, fleeting touches that sent shivers down my spine. My friends and family told me it was just my imagination, that I was adjusting to my new reality. But I knew better. Something was wrong. Something was watching me.

One night, as I lay in bed, the whispers became screams. Terrifying, blood-curdling screams that filled my head, drowning out all other thoughts. I bolted upright, my heart pounding, and felt a presence in the room with me. It was cold, malevolent, and it pressed down on me, suffocating me with its darkness.

I reached out, hoping to find something, anything, to reassure me that I was alone. My hands brushed against something cold and clammy, like rotting flesh. I recoiled in horror, but the presence only grew stronger. I could feel it breathing down my neck, its rancid breath hot against my skin.

“Leave me alone!” I screamed, thrashing wildly. My hand struck something solid, and I heard a low, guttural growl. Panic surged through me, and I scrambled out of bed, stumbling blindly through my room. I could hear it following me, its footsteps heavy and deliberate.

I fled to the living room, collapsing on the floor in a heap. The whispers returned, softer this time, but more insidious. They wormed their way into my mind, planting seeds of doubt and fear. I was losing my grip on reality, and I knew it.

Days turned into weeks, and the hauntings grew worse. The visions started next. Even in my blindness, I saw them—dark, twisted shapes lurking in the corners of my mind. They would slither and writhe, their forms constantly shifting. Sometimes, they had faces—ghastly, contorted faces with hollow eyes that stared into my soul.

I stopped sleeping, too terrified to close my eyes. Every time I did, the visions would consume me, dragging me down into a pit of madness. My friends tried to help, but they couldn’t understand. They couldn’t see what I saw, hear what I heard.

One night, as I sat in my living room, clutching a knife for protection, I heard the front door creak open. My heart raced, and I strained to listen. Footsteps echoed through the hallway, slow and deliberate. I knew it wasn’t one of my friends—they had all but abandoned me, unable to deal with my growing paranoia.

The footsteps stopped just outside the living room, and I could feel the presence watching me. It was the same malevolent force that had haunted me since the accident, and it was getting bolder. I gripped the knife tighter, my knuckles turning white.

“Who are you?” I shouted into the darkness. “What do you want from me?”

The whispers answered, a chorus of sinister voices that filled my mind. “Your soul,” they hissed. “We want your soul.”

I lashed out with the knife, swinging wildly at the air. I felt it connect with something solid, and a terrible, inhuman scream filled the room. The presence recoiled, but it didn’t retreat. It was toying with me, enjoying my fear.

Suddenly, I felt something cold and sharp press against my neck. I froze, my breath catching in my throat. The whispers grew louder, more frenzied. They were chanting now, a dark, ritualistic incantation that made my skin crawl.

“He’s here,” they said. “He’s coming for you.”

I could feel the blade digging into my skin, drawing a thin line of blood. Panic surged through me, and I thrashed wildly, trying to break free. The presence held me down, its strength inhuman.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, the pressure vanished. I collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. The whispers faded, leaving me in a silence that was somehow more terrifying than the noise.

I don’t know how long I lay there, but eventually, I mustered the strength to crawl back to my bedroom. I locked the door behind me and huddled in the corner, clutching the knife to my chest. Sleep was impossible, but I closed my eyes, hoping for a moment of peace.

Instead, the visions returned, more vivid and terrifying than ever. I saw a figure standing over me, its eyes glowing red in the darkness. It reached out, its fingers long and clawed, and touched my face. I could feel its cold, clammy skin against mine, and I screamed.

When I opened my eyes, the figure was gone, but the fear remained. I knew it was only a matter of time before it came back, before it claimed me completely. I was trapped in a nightmare, and there was no escape.

The next day, I called a priest. I was desperate, willing to try anything to rid myself of the darkness that had taken over my life. He arrived that afternoon, a kind, older man with a gentle demeanor. He listened to my story without judgment, and then he began to pray.

As he recited his prayers, I felt a strange sensation—a warmth spreading through my body, pushing back the cold. The whispers grew louder, more frantic, but I could feel their grip on me loosening. The priest sprinkled holy water around the room, and the darkness recoiled, hissing in anger.

For the first time in weeks, I felt a glimmer of hope. The priest assured me that the presence was weakened, but he warned me that it was not gone. It would return, and when it did, I would need to be strong.

That night, I slept for the first time in what felt like an eternity. My dreams were still haunted by the visions, but they were less intense, less real. I woke up feeling more rested than I had in months.

But the reprieve was short-lived. The next night, the whispers returned, more sinister and malevolent than ever. The darkness was angry, vengeful. It wanted me to suffer, to pay for daring to defy it.

I knew then that I couldn’t fight this battle alone. I reached out to my friends, begging for their help. They were reluctant at first, but eventually, they agreed. We devised a plan—a way to confront the darkness and banish it once and for all.

We gathered in my living room, candles lit, the air heavy with tension. The priest joined us, his presence a beacon of hope in the encroaching darkness. He began to pray, his voice strong and unwavering.

As the prayers filled the room, the whispers grew louder, more frantic. The darkness writhed and twisted, lashing out at us. We stood firm, refusing to back down.

Suddenly, the temperature dropped, and a chill settled over us. The presence was back, stronger than before. I could feel it, a palpable, suffocating force that seemed to fill every corner of the room.

The priest continued to pray, his voice rising above the chaos. The darkness fought back, but we held our ground. My friends clung to each other, their fear palpable.

The whispers turned into screams, a cacophony of agony that made my ears ring. I felt a cold hand grip my shoulder, and I knew it was the presence, making its final stand.

The priest’s prayers grew louder, more urgent, but I could sense his doubt. The darkness fed off it, growing stronger, more aggressive. I felt a sharp pain in my chest, as if claws were digging into my flesh.

“He’s here,” the whispers hissed. “He wants you.”

The priest sprinkled more holy water, but it did nothing. The darkness laughed, a deep, guttural sound that shook me to my core. I could feel its breath on my face, its rancid scent filling my nostrils.

Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, the presence receded, leaving me gasping for air. The room fell silent, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. I could hear my friends’ ragged breaths, their fear mirroring my own.

The priest’s voice trembled as he spoke. “I have done all I can. The darkness is strong, and I fear it will not leave you.”

I felt a wave of despair wash over me. The priest had been my last hope, and I felt a wave of despair wash over me. The priest had been my last hope, and now even he seemed powerless against the darkness. My friends left reluctantly, each one casting sympathetic, frightened glances my way. I was alone again, trapped in my perpetual night.

The days blurred into each other, a continuous stream of torment. The whispers never ceased, their hissing voices a constant companion. The presence lingered, always at the edge of my awareness, a malevolent shadow that never left my side.

I tried to go on with my life, but it was impossible. The darkness was always there, watching, waiting. It mocked me, tormented me with visions that felt all too real. I saw twisted faces, eyes burning with malice, reaching out to drag me into their abyss. I felt their cold fingers on my skin, heard their hollow laughter echoing in my mind.

One night, as I sat in my living room, trying to drown out the whispers with the static of the television, I felt it again—a cold presence that seemed to fill the room. My heart pounded, and I gripped the arms of my chair, too terrified to move.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The whispers answered, a chorus of sinister voices. “Because you belong to us.”

I felt something cold and sharp brush against my cheek, and I flinched. The darkness laughed, a low, rumbling sound that seemed to come from all around me. I could feel it closing in, suffocating me with its malevolence.

Desperation clawed at me, and I realized I had to do something—anything—to end this nightmare. I remembered the priest’s words, his warning that the darkness would return. But he had also said that I needed to be strong.

Gathering every ounce of courage I had left, I stood up, my legs shaking. “You don’t own me,” I said, my voice barely more than a whisper. “I won’t let you win.”

The darkness roared, a sound that shook the very foundations of my house. I felt a cold wind whip around me, and the whispers grew louder, more frenzied. But I stood my ground, refusing to give in to the fear that threatened to overwhelm me.

“I banish you,” I said, my voice growing stronger. “In the name of everything good and pure, I banish you!”

The darkness shrieked, a high-pitched wail that made my ears ring. I felt a pressure in my chest, as if something was trying to crush the life out of me. But I held on, repeating the words over and over.

“I banish you! I banish you!”

The pressure grew, the darkness closing in around me. I could feel it trying to pull me under, to drag me into its abyss. But I fought back, refusing to give in.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it was over. The darkness receded, the whispers fading into nothingness. I collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath, my body trembling with exhaustion.

I lay there for what felt like hours, too weak to move. But gradually, I realized something had changed. The darkness was still there, lurking at the edges of my awareness, but its grip on me was weaker, its presence less oppressive.

I knew then that the battle was far from over. The darkness would never truly leave me. It would always be there, a shadow lurking in the corners of my mind. But I had faced it, and I had survived.

As the days turned into weeks, I learned to live with the darkness. The whispers were still there, but they were quieter, less insistent. The visions still haunted my dreams, but they were less vivid, less real.

I knew I could never escape the darkness completely. It was a part of me now, a scar that would never fully heal. But I had found a way to live with it, to keep it at bay.

And so, I went on with my life, blind but not defeated. The darkness was my constant companion, a reminder of the horrors I had faced. But I had learned to live with it, to accept it as a part of my reality.

I knew the darkness would never give up, that it would always be waiting for a moment of weakness. But I had faced my demons and survived. And that was enough.

For now.
