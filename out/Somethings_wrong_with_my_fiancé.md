Me and my fianc√© have been together on and off since high school. There was never any animosity, I just wasn't mature enough for a serious relationship. We've been living together for three years and we've been engaged for a year now. 

I need you to understand, he was normal. He was always reassuring and kind, and *never* did anything like this before. 

He knows about my mental health, and me being schizophrenic. He understand it, and often will help me see my hallucinations aren't real, or will find a rational hole in my panicked thoughts to help me settle down. I don't have a lot of fears about him, there's not a lot of paranoid thoughts that he would do something to harm me.

But something weird is going on and I don't know how to fix it. It started about a month ago but it wasn't anything serious. I would just think he was staring at me, but every time I looked to him he was just watching the TV or playing his video games. It was unsettling but I've always just brushed it off. Just a hallucination.

It progressed form him just staring at me, to starting to smile too. It was just a little smirk at first, slowly growing to a smile, then a grin. The grin just kept growing, looking insane with these wide, wild eyes.

I asked him about it one night, just casually bringing up.

"Hey, so, I keep thinking you're staring at me and like... giving me this weird smile." I said, laughing softly, though it was an uncomfortable laugh.

"Weird smile?" He asked, looking over the back of the couch to me. I nodded slightly, looking a bit sheepish.

"Yeah, a really big grin, and like wide eyes." I opened my eyes wider to emphasize my point though I wasn't sure I'd be able to do the grin. It just looked so big, I still didn't know how he was doing it.

"Well, is it better than when you hallucinate spiders in bed?" He asked, raising an eyebrow.

I blinked, realizing he was right. Out of all my visuals, him looking at me with a big smile was the least concerning. 

I didn't think about it again until the next day when I was making dinner. I got off work an hour ago, and he was getting home just as I was finishing up. I glanced over to the door. 

"Hey baby." I greeted, giving him a smile as I looked to him. He gave a small smile back and went to hang up his jacket in the coat closet.

I looked back to what I was doing, plating the food and moved to set them on the table. He was standing with half of his body hidden behind the cased opening, staring at me. I jumped, dropping the plates and looked away, closing my eyes.

"Shit." I said, looking down to the broken glass and food that was now on the floor. "What the hell are you doing?" I snapped, looking back to him.

He just stood there, now fully in the open, staring at me, looking normal. No smile, no big eyes. He looked concerned, coming over to me. "Are you okay? What was that?"

I glared at him, bouncing on the balls of my feet for a moment. "What was that? I should be asking you that. Why were you standing there smiling like that?"

He furrowed his brows, looking away from me and made his way over. "Simon are you alright? You've been acting really weird? Did something happen at work or...?"

"Don't try and gaslight me about this. You were literally standing right there, smiling at me. I told you it was freaking me out, why would you intentionally do it?" I asked, trying to understand if he was just trying to mess with me or genuinely trying to convince me he wasn't doing anything.

"I wasn't doing anything. I just came in here." He said, looking at the mess on the floor. "Here. Come over here and I'll clean this up. We can order something in." He gestured me towards him, away from the trash.

I let out a sigh, narrowing my eyes at him and headed out of the kitchen, picking up my phone to find something to get delivered. I sat at the computer, behind the couch, trying to figure out what was going on with me.

After we'd ordered something and ate, I kept looking to him, expecting to see him smiling at me again. Sometime after the third or fourth time I turned to look at him, I settled a little. I didn't see the weird smile, he was just facing the TV. 

I thought he was finally done messing with me, that he'd realized he was taking it too far. 

At some point, I'd become so consumed in my own things that I didn't even realize he'd gotten up from the couch. I furrowed my brows, looking to the kitchen and then turned around in my chair. I almost yelled. He was standing on the stairs, hiding behind the wall halfway up, his head just sticking out. The big smile on his face just stretched wider. 

"You son of a bitch." I growled, getting up and chasing him up the stairs. He slammed the bathroom door and locked it as I pounded on it. 

"Kyle get out here now!" I shouted, banging on the door. "I'm sick of this shit, you better knock it off!" I hit the door one more time, and turned away.

I could hear him laughing to himself in there. 

I don't understand why he found it so funny to start messing with me like this but I'd had enough for the day. I grabbed my laptop and my charger and headed up to the bedroom. "You can sleep on the couch since you think you're so damn funny." I told him through the bathroom door. I locked the bedroom door behind me.

Eventually he stopped laughing and I heard him go back downstairs. I didn't let it bother me, instead I was content to let him suffer sleeping on the terrible couch we had. 

Hours later I woke up, not even realizing I'd fallen asleep. I sat up, rubbing my face and went to close my laptop. But I froze, staring at the door.

He was standing there again, half hidden behind the wall. His eyes were wider than ever, growing too wide for his face like his smile. 

I got out of bed, grabbing the knife I kept in my night stand and turned back to look at him. He was now at the end of the bed, staring at me with this unreadable emotion in his eyes. I gripped the knife so tight my knuckles turned white as I stared back at him.

I flicked the knife open, not trusting him at all. My paranoia was at an all time high and considering what he'd been doing I felt warranted in it.

"Get. Out." I told him, pointing to the door with my free hand.

He scampered out on his hands and knees, cackling again as I got up and locked the door again. This time I put chair under the door knob so he couldn't open it. 

I couldn't fall back asleep, just staring at the ceiling in complete silence. I could hear him moving around a bunch downstairs and then running up the stairs and going back down. I  didn't know what the hell was wrong with him but it was freaking me out. 

He came back up the steps, and stopped outside the bedroom door. The doorknob rattled and he tried to open it. He couldn't get it open with the chair and knocked on the door.

"Let me sleep in the bed." He said through the door.

"No, Mickey. Go sleep on the couch. We can talk about this in the morning." I told him, not playing this game with him tonight.

He knocked louder. "Let me sleep in the bed." The intonation was the exact same.

I stared at the door, shifting slightly back on the bed to sit up and stare at the door.

"Let me sleep in the bed." He began to knock louder, then began scratching at the door.

"Let me in the bed. Let me in the bed. Let me in." His scratching got louder and I gripped the knife tightly, looking around for my phone. I realized I'd left it downstairs and cursed under my breath. I had no way of calling for help. 

He rattled the doorknob, repeating *let me in* for a good hour. When he finally left I had stood up, ready in case he came in again.

I heard him going downstairs and he began to make a lot of noise. I assumed he was breaking things, occasionally hearing something shatter or get knocked over. Around the time the sun had started to rise it got quiet again.

This had to be some sort of manic episode on his end. After a few hours of waiting for another noise or anything I carefully unlocked the door and came outside. The door was covered in these deep black scratch marks, along with the walls in the hallway. 

It felt like some sort of oil or something. When I came downstairs it was so much worse. There were scratches on the wall sure, but all the dishes in the kitchen were broken. The fridge was on it's side, all the contents thrown around. All the meat that was in the freezer as now out of it's bags on the floor.

The worst part was that the front door was wide open. His car is still in the driveway and he has his phone turned off. I ended up calling my mom and dad who came over and helped me pack some essentials. They're letting me stay in their guest room, but I keep checking the doorbell camera to see if he comes home. 

He still hasn't.
