9 PM on a Thursday evening. Almost through to the weekend, but not quite yet. Stomach rumbling, but the energy to cook beyond me.


Time for an extortionately-priced delivery I’ll come to regret within seconds of finishing it.


Or, this time, even sooner.


I scroll for what seems like hours. Indecision cripples me, but I eventually settle on a Chinese place a few blocks over. Could’ve walked, probably would have saved some money too, but tiredness ruled that out.


Great, sweet and sour chicken, steamed rice and a mini bottle of white wine chosen and paid for. 


“*Your order will be collected and delivered before 21:53 by Timothy.*”


Oh, funny, never had a driver who shared my name before. Wonder what he looks like. I click his name, struggle to zoom into the tiny circular profile and almost drop my phone in a panic.


It’s me.


The same nose, the same eyes, the same little scar in between the eyebrows. Except it’s a picture I had never taken. Clutched in between arms was a fully packed bag of Danny’s Famous Pies. Everyone always raves about it, and I suppose the famous part of the name had to come from somewhere, but I hate that place. Can’t even stand being near anything they make.


Maybe the two beers I’d downed after work were having a stronger-than-usual reaction on me. 


Maybe not.


“*The restaurant has finished preparing your order and Timothy will arrive in 13 minutes. Please note your rider has one stop along the way.*”


Ugh, why did I always have to get the ones with stops already laid out. My stomach grumbled in protest. I wanted to play around with the profile picture to pass the time, so I pulled up a reverse image search thingy and put it through that. No matches. 



“*Timothy is less than 2 minutes away! Here is your unique code for collection, we hope you enjoy it.*”


Finally. I’d almost forgotten about the whole eerily-close lookalike thing with how ravenous I’d become. Not quite, though. I practically ran out to the elevator so I could grab the food in the lobby and avoid the typical confusion of visitors not knowing where to go. The doors close agonisingly slowly. I press the button and stare at the electronic sign above my head.

*Ding*.


Now is not the time, old lady who lives on the third floor. Please get in faster.

*Ding*.


The doors open to a lobby devoid of people. Except one. Clad in that awful bright blue gear they’re forced to wear, the rider stands with his back to me and ruffles through his giant insulated bag.


“*Hey, are you Timothy? I’m waiting on a delivery.*”


“Name?” he speaks without so much as turning around.


“*Erm, Timothy.*”


My heart sinks as he turns around to reveal something I so badly wanted to put down to coincidence yet couldn’t. He was me. *Just* like in the photo. Not a single difference, not a blemish where there shouldn’t be one nor a slightly premature strand of grey hair. Nothing. And he had this feel about him, too. Like he’d been here before or expected it to happen. Like he wanted to be there. It was almost unnatural. You know when your gut screams at you sometimes? Telling you something or someone is just off? That feeling drowned out everything else. Including my hunger. Without so much as giving him a second look, I scampered over to the stairwell and ran up more flights of stairs than I’d have thought possible. By the time I’d made it back into the apparent safety of my apartment, my gut screamed at me still. Something about the look in his eyes terrified me beyond belief. Something in them conveyed emotions in a way I’d never seen somebody be able to. They seemed furious at me, enjoying my fear, and yet they had this look of pity in them too.


I’m not quite sure what good writing things up will do, but I enjoy journaling stuff and it helps calm me down when shitty things happen and so here we are. It’s not helping as much as it usua—-


Someone’s at the door. 


The knocks are turning into pounds. Harder and harder. They’ll get in if I don’t go look. I have to go look.


God, whoever’s reading this, please God help me. I think I know who’s at the door. *What’s* at the door.



Final comments: 


Hey, just finishing up with this journaling session. I really do get myself worked up over nothing sometimes, guess that’s part of writing about how I feel while things are still happening. Oh well, you live and you learn. 


Anyway, I’m really hungry again. 


I think I fancy a slice of Danny’s.
