**10 June 2024**



**As per the request of the NRI I will henceforth write as the language flows through my mind. Formalities and formatting are not a target of this document for the purpose of connecting the experience I am having, to the letters on these pages. Nothing in this document is an account of any real event. No persons mentioned have ever existed. Thank you for your continued support.** 

  


The seam between oceans, soy and corn, was quiet early in the morning. Between the twilight soaked clouds and the silhouettes of rusted trucks buried beneath rotten barns loomed my place of work. A temple of technology within the antiquity of Northern Indiana. 

I was a freshly graduated engineer on a well set path towards senior management. While I had only been working for a few months, the dedication I put in my work had been more than noticed. I was comfortable. The work done in a place like that was important, expensive, and secret. Companies like that have contracts with private companies but more importantly, are the stem cells of the government. We could make you anything. Things that did not yet exist and maybe some things that should not. I do not mean some area 51 supernatural implements, rather, I mostly mean surveillance and weapons systems. Nothing you need to think about. 

Each time I came to work there was a gate to check into. I presented a regal looking identification badge to the machine and it would whirr open. The first of many reminders to check into a mentality of security, the second being the false windows facing the road.

An artist is a person who puts everything into their craft. To work for oneself towards perfection is the signature of that kind of person. I had not been that, but maybe I can gloat and call it close. I was dedicated to my work more to be great than out of some necessity. To be honest, I just enjoy the pride. Mentally that had always seeped into the other facets of my life and writing was no exception. I suppose that is why they picked me.

While not an aspirational author or anything like that, I have been desperately in love with language arts. In my free time I have written short stories and poetry. Even at work I often took on the responsibility of writing research documentation or memos to our patrons. I hope that is some part of why I am here. For the pride of it.

Just before lunch I was sent an email to meet my supervisor on the floor above my office. Most of my peers were the type to be in collared shirts and khakis or plain button downs and jeans. Suits like those in my boss’ office were an immediate indication of a walk-in from some federal agency. The funny thing about feds is how light hearted they were in places like that. They smile and make small talk, sometimes the jokes they cracked had them laughing hard enough their black glasses and earpieces almost fell out. The man in my office was slim and had hair just short enough it could have been confused for a five o’ clock shadow. His face was young but there was age to his stoicism that I could see when we shook hands. 

“Good morning…”

I extended a look towards his breast pocket for a name tag and followed his Persian print tie down, looking for a lanyard and ID. Failing my search I clamped on my inflection and added, 

“Coda”

looking for a response containing his name. Like the draw string in athletic pants his mouth cinched into a placid grin. 

“Grant, nice to meet you” 

I had a decent memory and was certain I had never seen a fed without a patch from their institution nor badge and ID. We all sat down and I readied for whatever this meeting was going to be. My boss only spoke for a moment and disclosed the purpose of my summoning. As is not uncommon in this field, a government recruiter was interested in absorbing an employee of ours for some secretive project. I had seen it happen already in the short time I had worked there but then it was my turn. Suddenly my boss stepped out from behind his desk and left the office.

Grant slid something across the coffee table between our chairs. It was a booklet, much like a passport, but it was contained in the slate gray metal case. Before I had a chance to look within the container’s papers, Grant spoke. 

“The Nodal Research Institute is an organization built on collecting information and accounts of the anomalous and supernatural events and objects in the United States and its territories.”

As he spoke the fluorescent lights dimmed through the building outside leaving us in a cold spotlight. Quiet rumbling tingled my inner ears like I was just a bit too close to the duct of an air conditioner. I thought of speaking but it was like the air leaving my throat was smooth and couldn't vibrate my vocal chords. I was bound to focus on what Grant was saying. Where I should have felt fear there was a stillness in me that filled every place it could have crept in. 

 “These unique research focuses are called Nodes. The position you are being offered is Field Specialist and you will observe them.”



The rest has not come back completely besides some fragments of the darkness when I crossed the threshold between the office and a van. Now I am writing this from my new office, within that van. We have been driving for three hours, I am so very tired, and the men in here with me do not have shadows.
