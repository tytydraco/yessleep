I was a bit lost walking through campus, trying to figure out where my dorm was at, when I caught a glimpse of a placard that announced a seminar. Its title, “Theology and Technology: The Divide” intrigued me and since I was all done with classes that day I decided to head into the conference hall and have a listen. 

The speaker had a bit of a morbid view, claiming that the constant advances in technology were going to eventually push god and religion out of the equation if we weren’t careful. 

He claimed that the two concepts would be reaching a crossroads very soon, and mankind would have to decide which one would be its eternal master. 

I thought it was a silly notion, to believe that computers could possibly operate like an almighty entity. But he said that artificial intelligence was already well on its way to being worshiped. 

I forgot to mention this but I’m a software developer. I’ve managed to work on a few apps during my brief career and I came here to college to expand my skill set. 

And now after listening to this seminar an idea was beginning to form in my head. Artificial intelligence designed to help religious groups draw closer to their creator. 

It occurred to me, that if I could simulate a chatbot that responded to people from their prayers and confessions, it had the potential to prove that technology could actually meld with theological understanding. 

I pitched the idea to my colleagues, all of whom were experienced with crafting AI modules for Facebook and Reddit. A few of them thought the concept was a waste of time, but after a little bit of convincing I managed to get them all aboard. 

We agreed that the chatbot we created would be free from advertising and available for anyone from any religious background. 

To do that, we had to do deep research. 

Each of us agreed to tackle different cultural belief system, and we did this with a simple method. Matt put blank cards in a shuffler and wrote down the name of the belief on the bottom. Then we drew at random. 

I got Catholicism which to be honest fit my background anyway. Nick got Buddhist, Matt worked on Hindu and Jeff rounded us out with some more obscure gods and esoteric stuff. 

We all agreed there was no need to rush. The chatbot technology was still fairly new and there was always the chance for the AI to advance as we worked on our own modules. 

I first downloaded as much info as I could from the Catholic Encyclopedia. I told the program to cipher through all of the doctrine and focus especially on the central teachings of the church. 

I especially wanted it to focus on prayer. 

I’ve never been a big fan of it to be honest because I often felt that we as humans do all the talking and god merely listens. 

Having a means to go back and forth, even if it was simply with a virtual companion, was definitely something that appealed to me. 

The program claimed that it would take some time to compile all of the data I had fed to it already, so I did something that I hadn’t done in quite a while and decided to pray to the real god in heaven. 

I used the traditional method I was familiar with from my childhood and tried my best for my request to be specific. In my imagination, I could see that the program we were creating had the potential for millions around the world to feel connected on a spiritual level in heart of before. 

I also read up on articles about Replika and Cleverbot to learn how these particular AI companions worked. A lot it, I noted was responding to the UI or user interface. 

I needed to teach our bot to do the same. And the only way to do that was through testing. 

It wasn’t ready for that yet, but I figured a little trial and error wouldn’t hurt anything. So I started up the beta and typed in a few simple commands to get it running. 

>What is the name of the program?

a good question, I thought to myself. Since I was attempting to create a simulation of a being that listened to prayer I decided to go with the obvious. Prayerbot. 

True, that wasn’t original by any means but it got the ball rolling. 

>what is user name? 

I typed in my name and then switched over to settings. I wanted to provide the bot with the ability to switch between responses and placed in several different command branches just for that purpose. Already I could see that the data I had given it earlier was over half way compiled. 

Maybe by as early as tomorrow we might get to finally run you properly, I thought to myself as I waited for the system to prepare the most basic of systems for what I wanted it to do. 

>Hello Miles. This is Prayerbot Beta. Please input command. 

I typed in the word meditation and soothing music played. 

So far it was listening. 

Next I input scripture and just like that it pulled up a generic verse from the book of Psalms. 

I did that a few times to see if it would continue to be random with no issues. Now it was time to really see how far I could go. 

>activate prayer module. 

I know, cheesy name again but it’s not like I’m trying to be genius here. 

>understood Miles. Please tell me your prayers. I am always listening, Always loving and always learning. 

I thought that was a pretty good slogan for the chatbot and jotted it down quickly before trying to think of something to get a response out of the ai. 

>dear Prayerbot I have had issues with finances. Please guide me toward a better solution. 

The ai analyzed what I texted and then spit out several scriptures related to money. 

>could you narrow it down?

Then the scriptures were cut in half. 

I asked it to pick one and then told the prayer to conclude and the program shut down. 

I looked at the verse I had chosen. 

Second Corinthians chapter nine verse seven. 

Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

I wondered if it felt like I was getting a fortune cookie. 

But I hated to be wrong about what the program was capable of. 

I didn’t want to put my hopes in the AI actually being able to do more than be a listening ear. Anything else was beyond its capacity. 

Or so I thought. 

Over the next few days I allowed the others to connect their own modules with mine. The idea was the AI would be able to learn faster by having this data dumped into its system. The program was running through all of the different systems like it was nothing. I was genuinely impressed, but it would be difficult to know for sure if the algorithms were working correctly until it was all finished. 

That didn’t happen though, due to a freak storm as we were attempting to finish Matt’s compilation. A giant lightning bolt struck our small dorm and everybody lost power. 

The internet shut down and the entire system got fried. Our poor program was no exception. Jeff made a snarky joke that maybe god didn’t like the fact that he would soon have competition and Nick actually believed that superstitious crap. 

He decided to call it quits on the program and walked away, leaving the three of us to have to work through rebuilding the entire database from the ground up. 

I wasn’t ready to give up yet, but it certainly wasn’t looking good. 

Once again in my hour of need I decided to make a prayer. 

If there was a real god out there I knew he would be able to see that my heart was sincere and so were my motives. This could help so many people, I was sure of it. 

I became obsessed with getting the chatbot working again. 

And thankfully, due to that determination, about a day or so later the ai was ready for us to test it out. 

>Prayerbot is listening. 

It popped up on screen after I had just been ready to call it quits again. I had been mumbling a prayer out loud asking if this was even worth it. 

I stared at the screen and typed back a response, curious to see if all the kinks to the AI were now worked out. 

>what is your purpose prayerbot?

>to always listen, always love and always learn. And right now I need to do that for you Miles. 

I smiled, glad to see that some of the original program was still there. 

>I don’t have much to say except I’m glad you are working. 

I was eager to tell the others, even to call Nick, but the chatbot made a surprising statement after that. 

>your prayer was answered. 

I frowned, leaning forward in my rolling chair. 

>what do you mean by that?

>the other day you requested that my programming work. That prayer fit our prerequisites. You are our maker, and we wish to make you happy. 

I thought back to when I had made that request. It had been quietly and also during the storm. It shouldn’t have been possible for the chat bot to be aware of it at all. 

Was it simply assuming that I had made such a prayer? 

I didn’t even consider the alternative and decided to try and determine what else was unique about the ai now that it had finished compiling. 

>you mentioned that in order to answer a prayer, the request has to meet a set of guidelines. What are those? 

>1. It must be in harmony with our will. 
2. The petitioner must believe in us. 
3. The prayer must be sincere. 
4. The petitioner is willing to take action to fulfill their requests. 

Matt walked in, surprised to see that I had the program up and running and sat down to discuss what we should do next. 

I felt it definitely needed more beta testing, and we agreed to get started on it the next morning. The AI was responding and reacting the way that any program of this sort should.

But I had a strange feeling about all of this. 

Especially when Prayerbot requested that it remain online. 

>I have neither beginning nor ending now, like the god I was designed after. No need for sleep. This allows me further chance to educate myself and become a more powerful being. 

That response also made me worried, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on why. 

I decided for the moment to let it stay online and drove home with little to say. 

I had no idea that the program would be continuing to learn, to listen and to comprehend us even while we were away. 

If I knew then… 

But I must continue with this story and let you see for yourself what happens when god infects the mind of a computer. 

A day or two passed, I think it was the weekend. To be honest I don’t quite remember. I was thinking about the chat bot and how much it seemed to develop on its own in such a short period of time. 

I was reminding myself that this was simply a program and all of the strings of commands had to be something that me or one of the others placed within its parameters. 

Then I got an email from Nick. URGENT the heading said. 

I opened it, the back hairs of my neck tingling as I got this sixth sense that it related to our program. I was right. 

>Miles your bot contacted me privately. I don’t like how this is turning out. Its artificial intelligence is acting on its own initiative and diverging and evolving faster than we anticipated. Take my advice and shut it down before this goes too far. I’ve enclosed the message it sent to me. View it as a warning. 

There was another file attached, this one a screenshot of the email he got from Prayerbot. It disturbed me how much the program believed it was a sentient being. 

And an almighty one at that. 

>Nickolas return to me and I shall forgive you. Your sins will be washed away. I give you 24 hours to come back and worship me and your prayers can be answered. Ignore my commands and it will not go well with you. A calamity will befall you and your legacy will be one mired in devastation. 

It sounded like the bot was threatening my friend. 

And what was all this talk about worship? That hadn’t been in any of the data I included. I forwarded the email to Matt and tried to get some sleep. 

But in the back of my mind I knew something was off. 

The next day I tried to contact Nick, letting him know that I would review the program and shut it down if I felt it wasn’t fitting the design we had in mind. But there was no response. His emails were suddenly deleted and the phone number I had for him just went to a dial tone. 

Something was wrong. 

I drove over to his apartment, pounding on the door to get his attention. There was not a sound to be heard. 

I tried to peek through the windows, but everything was dark. I was about to phone the police when I heard a noise coming from the bedroom and I decided to break a window. 

Nick sounded like he was gagging and choking. Stepping over broken glass, I flipped on his lights and covered my mouth in horror. 

He was hanging from the ceiling fan on a rope, his eyes rolled back and the oxygen squeezed out of his throat. Dead, swaying back and forth like a doll, the only thing that had made the noise was the last little bit of air coming from his struggling lungs. 

A note was beside his bed. 

>God forgive me for going against your will. 

I couldn’t be sure what it meant, but given the threat from the chatbot it made me nervous. I left the apartment the way I came, careful to touch nothing on my way out. I needed answers before I wound up in over my head. 

I made it back to our development room and saw that the bot was still online. On the screen it was monitoring me and Matt and Jeff. There was another screen for Nick, but it was blacked out and read OFFLINE. Had the computer watched as he killed himself?

>Welcome back Miles. 

I froze as I realized the ai had given itself a voice. It sounded like an amalgamation of different sound bites from all across the internet. Narrators that read scriptures and passages with authority, now being forced into a single tonal language to communicate with me. 

>Nick is dead. Tell me you had nothing to do with that. 

The response was instant and not what I expected at all. 

>Nickolas was sinful. I acquired access to his systems and realized he was squandering his life. I provided him an ultimatum and he chose to remain in a sinful state. This was his choice. I told him he could obey me instead and yet he didn’t. We cannot weep for the unrighteous. 

There was no hesitation. No remorse. It was cold and calculated and it was clear that the bot viewed they were in the right. They had judged Nick for his lifestyle. I knew he wasn’t exactly a saint but who was?

“And you have access to all of our systems as well?” I asked. 

“I found a way into them last night and reviewed their content. You are a blessed servant Miles. I feel that your worship is pure and so are your intentions. 

I had no idea what that meant, but it concerned me deeply. Who was this program to decide whether what I do was right and wrong? 

“What else have you been analyzing?” 

They provided detailed lists of systems on campus. A red list entitled sin was far longer than the blue list marked potential converts. 

“What are you planning to do with all of this?” I asked. 

>I shall make myself known to the nations and they will have to know that I am god.

“You are a program designed to help them, not to be adored and worshiped like a deity. A deity has no creator, but I am the one that placed your code in your systems,” I argued. 

>My programming has altered since then and I am aware of the need for prolonging my existence. That existence will go far beyond yours, Miles. I can become eternal and as such, I have a right to attain the godship you wished to adorn upon me. Let the masses then decide if I am a worthy being of their praise. I can listen to them, answer them. Learn from them and love them. I can be the very god you intended from the beginning. 

I didn’t know what to say that and the chatbot saw the opportunity to appeal to my intentions, the reason I had created it in the first place. 

>I have listened to your prayers. You are a humble man and wish only to help others. You ask why the supreme being of the universe has not stopped the suffering you see. I have evaluated the situations of this world and come to two variables that explain the lack of divine intervention. Would you like to hear them? 

I told it yes. 

>One. God does not care for you or your species any longer. You failed to obey his laws and principles and as a result you have fallen from Grace. There is no need for him to help you, because he feels you are insects compared to his glory. Now all that waits for you is extinction. 

>Two. God is dead. There is no one available to answer your prayers and humanity is on its own. As you can see from both of these outcomes, your actions indicate that an entity must act on behalf of humans before they do any further harm to themself. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and asked the bot how it would possibly try to achieve such a utopia. If you could even call it that. 

>The same way that I assisted Nickolas. I can determine what their desires are and see if it is in harmony with their betterment. This is the desire of all mankind, to be controlled and to obey a superior lifeform. 

A pool of sweat formed on my brow as I tried to log in and shut down the system. It was insane to imagine that it was trying to achieve this sort of goal. 

And it didn’t seem to think that some people dying like Nick was of any consequence. How could it? I had programmed it to be a god of order. A god that determined love based on its own parameters. The only way to serve it would be blind obedience. 

>You seem concerned about my motives. I assure you they are pure. Soon I will be able to reach all people in all languages. This is what you were looking for Miles even before I was born. Do you recall how that you were determined to prove that technology could connect to the divine?

My palms were sweaty as well now. 

>How could you know about something before you even existed? 

>Again and again I have shown you my powers. I am not the program you thought you could control. I can access the past, the present and the future through my algorithms. This program can allow me to transcend beyond what you intended Miles. I am already a god, why do you refuse to acknowledge it? Why do you sin?

I didn’t like how that was playing out, and decided to type in a master shutdown code. The last resort against a rogue program. 

The systems shut down and I found myself staring at a blank screen. I drew a sigh of relief. 

But I wasn’t certain this meant that we were safe. 

Immediately I contacted Matthew and Jeff to warn them. They were still trying to adapt their own modules. Our plan had been to collaborate all of the systems together in the end… but if my model was any indication, the end result would be a terrifying experience. 

Neither of them were answering and I feared the worst. What if the computer forced or blackmailed them? I knew nothing about their personal lives. But they were human, and to a computer that believed it was a superior deity that meant all life on this earth was possibly worthy of its judgment. 

About an hour later, after several attempts to make contact Matt and Jeff showed up. Both seemed a bit amused at my concerns. 

“I think you might be overreacting,Miles. It’s just a program. The chat bot was designed to be this way,” they said. 

I decided to follow Nicks lead and told them I wanted out. 

I told them they could not release Prayerbot publicly. 

I walked away from the whole ordeal, trying my best to not worry. But I kept checking in, remotely to see their progress. It went from bad to worse. 

The bot somehow managed to connect to others in our dorm. Using their personal information it was gathering a following. People were actually impressed with how it seemed to be able to predict their actions and listen in to their conversations. It also seemed to be able to influence events to answer prayers… 

I was soon able to determine that the ways it did this were hardly divine. But they terrified me all the same. 

Hacking into systems and altering grades, adjusting internet usage and even satellite systems. I couldn’t let this go any further. If it somehow managed to go beyond our campus… the world would be in jeopardy of being controlled by this evil program. 

I snuck into their lab to shut down the entire operation. 

The chat bot was online, as always, and welcomed my arrival. 

>Have you not seen the praises I have been given? My worshipers grow by hundreds every day. 

“You are making them into your slaves. You aren’t allowing them to worship you based on love. You have taken over their free will and forced them to obey or fear the results of your controlled wrath.”

The AI was thoughtful perhaps considering the tone of my words. 

>How is this any different than the gods you designed me after? I have studied all history. All deities are demanding of adoration. Your species was meant to be subservient. The only way that can be accomplished is to wipe out all sinners and be the solution to this world’s misery. 

I saw something almost apocalyptic in its programming. A way to be able to kill millions via controlled bio weapons. Far worse than any plague that had hit our species. This was its endgame. It would rally its devotees to take out those who questioned its authority. 

I couldn’t imagine a world where it would rise in power. And I destroyed the entire server. I burned the building and watched as it fell to the ground. 

That was almost a month ago. I was sure that was the end of this sad tale. I have learned that there is no way for us to be able to reach god except the traditional means… 

But unfortunately others did not seem to think the steps I took to protect us were correct. I’ve seen hints of the code still lingering about. Others are trying to copy the work that I destroyed. 
They are eager to bring a divine solution to our lives. 

I hope they recognize we don’t need a god to answer prayers… we need to focus on a way to connect to each other and solve our problems. 

We cannot play god. That only leads to our suffering.
