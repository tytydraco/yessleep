I am working in Japan right now. NEL program- Nihon English Learners. I'm a teacher in a rural area of the country. I joke that they've placed me in Japanese Nebraska- my apartment building is surrounded by fields on all sides. Colorado might be a better comparison, the region I'm in is a bowl enclosed in mountains, but that's not the point. The point is, I'm alone.

I keep in touch with the folks back home as much as I can- I have two phones, my American phone and my Japanese phone. My American phone is effectively a paperweight without an internet connection, but when I'm on wifi I use it to video call my parents. They're good people, my mother is a social services caseworker and my dad is a reporter for the paper back home. I hope I'm doing them proud. My Japanese phone is less constrained, but the only people who I talk to are my supervisors at work. I'm a young man in my 20s, this is my most serious job yet, and the rest of the department is women in their 30s who have done a lot more schooling than I did to get here. That I'm intimidated by them is an understatement. 

There's things they forget to tell you in the pamphlets and brochures about coming to Japan. One of them is that trash day is a bitch. You have to sort your trash, combustibles and non combustibles, and put it in the right backs for the right days of the month. Combustibles get collected twice a week, non combustibles once a month. If you don't remember to take it out to collect, you're fucked until same time next month. 

They also forget to tell you that alcohol is much cheaper here than back home. Much, much cheaper. I'm talking I can buy Jack Daniel's for cheaper than it is at home, and I lived where they bottle the shit! So, high anxiety plus imposter syndrome plus home sickness plus boredom plus cheap booze equals flirting with alcoholism. I have so many empty bottles and empty cans- there's this thing called strong zero, if it ever comes stateside I thoroughly recommend it. Metal and glass are non combustibles, there is only one day a month you can toss them, and I keep forgetting. I have so many bags in my apartment, and looking at them fills me with shame. You're not supposed to take them out the night before, but fuck it- I'm thinking about it tonight and I might not wake up in time in the morning. So I take the trash out in my flip flops because I'm only going to be out there for a minute.

Another thing they forget to mention in the training manuals is that. That thing I can see in my apartment windows, staring at me at the dumpster. You ever seen those oni masks? Imagine that, but with cats eyes. I don't know what it is or why it's there- I left my apartment door unlocked when I went to the dumpster, I guess it's on me- but it's staring at me right now. My Japanese phone is in the apartment, my American phone was in my bathrobe pocket when I went out. I must have called mom and dad the other day and tucked it in here. I'm lucky the wifi reached as far as it does, but my problem is this- I have no idea who to call or what to say. I don't have my supervisors numbers memorized, even if I did I can't call them on this phone. I can't get the local police, because I don't speak the language. I've been meaning to learn, I've been putting it off. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. That thing is still staring at me, I feel paralyzed by its glare. It's so cold, if I don't get indoors I'll get frostbite, but I have nowhere to go. I'd like to think I made my parents proud, I'm afraid I've only made them suffer.
