 

I’m a 16 year old guy, not that popular in school and I barely get above a D in my classes. So I’m not the most social nor the smartest guy in the room. Despite this I do have a few friends and I’m even talking to a girl, or at least I was.

So recently my parents decided to go out of town, some kind of vacation, and I decided to use this time in the best way I could; playing video games and inviting my friends over. It was a friday night and I had booted up my play station and was playing the most recent call of duty. I was just waiting for my friends to get here so we could play Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I had also invited the girl I’ve been talking to, we’ll call her Miley, so we met at Anime club and really hit it off. Yeah, I watch anime, usually stuff like Baki and occasionally some of the lesser known stuff, though I mainly stick to the shonen type stuff.

So, I was waiting and at about 7 my two friends came over, Michael and Fin. We talked and joked, really just caught up. I really didn’t do well when we played but I got a win here and there. It was around 10 when they decided to leave and while I had fun I was also really bummed that Miley didn’t come over. I still had the rest of the weekend to myself so I tried inviting her over the next day. I couldn’t sleep and she hadn’t responded. Thankfully I knew her address and my parents left their sedan behind. I really wasn’t thinking that clearly so I got in my car and headed over to her place. When I got there all the lights were off besides her bedroom and there were no cars in the driveway. *Was she home alone?* I thought to myself. *Why didn’t she answer? Is she in danger?* I asked myself. I went up to her house and was about to knock but I stopped myself.

‘What if she was asleep?’ I thought to myself. I decided the best way to check on her safety was to sneak in. So I climbed over her fence and went to the backdoor, which was one of those sliding doors, and it was surprisingly easy to open, maybe even too easy.

I walked in, trying my best to keep quiet. I went by the kitchen, grabbing a knife in case her killer was still here. I slowly went up the stairs and made my way to her room, her door was open slightly. I pushed it all the way open and nobody was inside. I walked in, looking around, she had to be here right? If she wasn't, was it her killer? Were they waiting for me? I looked around a little more, searching beneath her bed, checking her bedside table. I was terrified, what happened to her?

Suddenly the closet door opened and my reflexes went into action, stabbing at whatever was trying to attack me. I heard the squish of my knife digging into flesh and I closed my eyes as I finished off whatever I was stabbing at. I didn’t open my eyes until I got out of the room, and when I looked back I saw Mileys dead body, and I screamed out in anguish, I must have been too focused on saving her that I didn’t see that she was already dead. I looked back into the room and couldn’t see anyone else, the attacker must have gotten away and fled. That Bastard. In shock I dropped the knife, and my legs began to think for themselves as I ran down the stairs, out of the front door and into my car. I stared at her lit window, thinking I should have done more, but I couldn’t. 

I drove home and tried to get a good night's sleep, but couldn’t. I stayed up for a while but eventually I passed out, and that’s where I am now. I’m hoping her murderer gets caught and her family gets justice.
