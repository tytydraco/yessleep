So.... I always tend to sleep sideways. Never flat on my back but last night I fell asleep laying on my back. Last thing I remember doing was looking up at the ceiling, thinking about my past. My boyfriend was already asleep, his face turned in my direction. The table lamp was illuminating his skin.

All the sudden the room went very dim. The table lamp wasn't on anymore. My eyes frantically scanning the room. 

And there she was. It was hard to see it as first but after my vision adjusted, I saw her standing in the corner of our room. Hair dark as night. Face pale and disfigured. Her eyes piercing as my soul. Then her face started moving to side of her shoulder, could hear her neck cracking as she moved. Then she smiled, her teeth and eyes were bleeding. The room was so silent I could hear the dripping.

"Babe... wake up"

I turned my head to the side and there he was, still fast asleep. I kept saying to myself no no no this isn't real. This is a dream. Wake up Amy wake up. Wake up now goddammit!

She was still standing there. I was fighting myself. I couldn't wake up or move my body. I don't even remember falling asleep but it for sure had to be a dream. I knew it couldn't be real. I could feel myself trying to wake up, I could hear my inner voice telling me to open my eyes. 

Then the table lamp turned back on. I stood up right away thinking I was finally awake. My boyfriend woke up and asked what was wrong. I was hyperventilating while pointing to the corner of the room. Saying "she's there. She's standing right there!!"

He turned to look then he said "Amy there's no one there"
But I could still see her despise having the light back on and being able to move. 

"Babe... I'm going crazy. I'm going fucking crazy. Help me. She's there. I see her standing there" I kept repeating this over and over, rocking my body back and forth while having both hands on my head. 

Then all the sudden I felt my body being jerked awake. This time I knew for sure I was awake. I sat up on my bed. I saw that my boyfriend was still sleeping and the lamp still on but this time, she was gone. I wasn't shaking, or hyperventilating anymore. I was just.. very confused. Second guessing myself if I was really awake. I couldn't fall back asleep after that. Last thing I remember doing is going to my Spotify and playing 'Someone New by SEA, Laeland' on repeat. I placed my phone under my pillow and fell back asleep.

My boyfriend's work alarm went off a couple hours later. When he woke up I was telling him about a "nightmare" I had. When I was telling him I was hyperventilating and pointing to the corner of the room he said "but Amy, you DID do that. You don't remember? I woke up. I was asking if you were ok"

I froze for a moment.. I couldn't understand. 

"Theres no way. I saw a dark figure in the room. It was for sure a dream. I couldn't wake up. And when I thought I woke up I still saw her. I eventually woke up for real and put music on"

He said "but you WERE awake. I kept asking you if you were ok"

I was like you lying. There's no way. You have to be lying

"But I'm not lying"

.......

I didn't ask anything more. But it's been bothering me all day.
