While your reading this you might notice a sense of paranioa come upon you.  Thats fine but for me i've been reading scary stories my whole life since i was almost 7, im 35 now. Nothing really scares me anymore ghost, monsters The DeepWeb/DarkWeb. I've i seen them all, i've always wanted to be scared so i been looking for scary stuff for the past few years.

 Nothing has really has been interesting, Until I came upon this one story a few days back a playlist really. I was looking on reddit and i came across an r/Nosleep scariest stories it was a group of about 21 stories. I've read them all of course and when i got the last story i thought it was be all the same.

 Like the last 20 stories i read. I mean they pretty different at most, and, I actually did like them. But the last story, is the one i've been obsessing over. The story, it just really hit me different I guess because it was similar to an experiecnce i had before. Well, that is what kinda got me into scary stuff in the first place anyways. I might aswell tell the experience, give you some back story, Why i like being scared and why i'll always obsesse over the feeling.

 Actually it scared me so bad i still remember most of the details almost 30 years later.     I was 6 years old in about a month I would turn 7, makes since now? My Ma was washing me in the bathtub. Of course my young self was enjoying the pleasure of the hot water. 

But my Mom said she would be getting my towel so she left and told me not to drown with a laugh in her voice. Her bedroom was next to the bathroom I was in, but, I couldn't see inside the room. All i could do was listen. So, as I was playing with my toy truck in the water expecting my Mother to come out at any moment with my towel. I heard a scream. It wasnt a normal scream though. It was cut off so quick if you wasnt paying attention you wouldnt have heard it all. 

For me I almost didnt hear it, it was my mom, Though, the scream was cut off so quick I just assumed it was her. I tried to stand up and see what happened but as I was started to move my mom came back into the bathroom with a towel. But i noticed the smallest little change about her now. she was one milimeter taller than before i noticed because the cabinets in the bathroom was at her eye level I didn't say anything though because i was still kinda shocked about what happened. 

Now, it was different, expect she acted normal like she did before, nothing had changed. She got me out of the tub and into some new clothes. One small thing about her though, she always let me sleep in her bed with her when i was scared. So, after hearing that cut off scream my young mind thought there might be a ghost in the house. 

I fianlly got the courage to ask her what had happened to her while she was in her room. I asked her but, there was no response, all she would mutter is that she saw the cat under the covers moving and thought it was something weird but quickly realized. I wasnt convinced though, but, thats all she said over and over that same story. I was still scared and kept telling her to let me in sleep with her.

Eventually she gave in, I got onto the bed but, some was very wrong with the way the bed was. It felt like something was under it. Like a spring broke or something. It was very lumpy and seemed like there was something between the mattress and the bed frame. My Mom seemed fine with it though, like she didnt even notice. I went to sleep and a few hours later, I presume, I couldnt shake the feeling of the horrible bed hurting my back i turned out to face her but, she was gone. I looked in the bathroom, gone I looked in my room and the living room.

There was not a single living soul in that house expect for me, not even my cat seemed to be anywhere. All the lights in the house were on, which she did like to leave the lights on sometimes so i assumed she was out some where and would come back very soon. But in the meantime I layed back down on the dreaded bed. I has to see what was under there. I used all my 6 year old strenght to push the mattress up and, my Mother? I didnt know what to think I was so shocked It was my mother under there the whole time. But who was the person acting like my mother though. 

&#x200B;

At that exact moment every single emotion started flooing my little brain i couldnt even move or even think, who was that or what was thing that was acting like her? I shut the door and locked it. I stayed in the room over night terrified about what had just transpired. Eventually i stayed in the room for days. Trying to wake her, terrified about the past events. But,  finally. I knew she was dead when I realized a stench was coming from her. Eventually I heard a knock on the bedroom door, I felt a 1000 pounds of weight lift off me.

Though, It was short lived when i was realized it could be anybody, or, anything. I realized if I didnt open the door eventually I would die because they would just break down the door. So, I opened it. i saw two police officers my grandparents and my dad who was out to work for a few days. I quickly leaped out and latched onto the officers crying and screaming.

 Eventually I told them the story about the that thing inpersonating my mom. Just by the looking in there face you could tell they didnt believe me, and i heard they just ruled it an overdose. Im starting to cry now and my wife is comforting me, but it noticed one small change about her. 

&#x200B;

She was about one milimeter taller. Ah its probably the tears in my eyes messing up my vision up. As she was comforting me I realized what that one milimeter meant and i nearly screamed but i didnt say anything. All she said was, are you scared yet?
