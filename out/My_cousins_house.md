There was always something off about my cousin’s house. Painted a bright, cheery yellow, it almost felt like it was trying too hard to look inviting. But no matter how sunny the outside appeared, a darkness seeped from within — and I could feel it. I’ve always been sensitive to the other side, and even as a child, I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t yet understand what I was feeling, but I sensed it deep in my bones.

My cousin — let’s call her Sam — lived a town over, and her mother, my aunt, babysat me often. Over time, the strange energy in their house grew stronger. The paranormal wasn’t just present; it was becoming bolder. At first, it was small things: shadows darting at the edge of my vision, objects subtly shifting position when no one was around. I told myself it was nothing. I believed — or wanted to believe — that if I ignored it, it would go away.

But it didn’t. And even if I pretended not to notice, my body still reacted. The fear was physical — a crawling sensation under my skin, a constant chill in the air. I knew, somehow, that whatever was in that house knew I was afraid.

The worst part of it all was when I had to sleep over.

Sam’s room was small and square. The closet was directly to the right when you walked in. Her bed was elevated, with a desk tucked beneath it against the back wall. I had to sleep on the floor, parallel to that closet. It made me nervous — so I always asked Sam to put her round, metal folding chair in front of the closet before we turned off the lights. It made me feel safer, though I never understood why.

Sam was high up on her bed, out of sight, and she never slept with a nightlight. Her room was completely dark — the kind of dark where your eyes never quite adjust. I always begged my aunt for a flashlight, and I’d keep it hidden under my sleeping bag just in case.

One night stands out above the rest. The memory of it still haunts me.

That night, I had made sure the chair was in front of the closet. I checked twice. Then the lights went out.

I was lying on my side, facing away from the closet, trying to will myself to sleep. That’s when I heard it: a long, metallic scrape across the floor… then a soft but heavy thump. Every muscle in my body locked up. Goosebumps erupted along my arms and neck. I barely breathed.

Then came the slow, deliberate click of the closet door unlatching.

I couldn’t move. I didn’t dare turn over. The air around me felt suddenly colder — sharp and unnatural. I don’t know how long I lay there, frozen. Minutes? Hours? It felt like forever.

Eventually, when the initial wave of terror began to fade just enough for me to act, I reached under my blanket and clicked on the flashlight. With my heart pounding, I turned over.

The chair was gone.

No — worse. It had been folded up and placed on its side in the far corner of the room.

The closet door… was slightly open.

Sam hadn’t moved. I could hear her snoring above me. I wanted to scream, to run, to get out — but I couldn’t leave the sleeping bag. The air outside felt biting cold, as if something were waiting.

I rolled back over, pulled the blanket tight around me, and shut my eyes.

That’s when I heard it — a voice. A soft whisper, impossibly close to my ear:

“Go… to… sleep.”

I didn’t sleep that night. I stared into the dark until the first light of dawn crept into the room. As soon as I could, I asked my aunt to call my mom to pick me up. I felt sick — genuinely ill — and I never told anyone what had happened.

Not until years later.

Sam and I had gone out for drinks and crashed at another cousin’s place, sleeping on the couch together. Somehow the conversation drifted to her old house. Half-laughing, half-nervous, I said, “I always thought your place was haunted. That folding chair used to move by itself when I slept over.”

Sam didn’t even hesitate.

“Oh yeah,” she said casually. “That house was definitely haunted. The people who lived there before us had a son. He drowned in the swimming pool out back.”

I froze. I had never heard anything about a death on that property — not once. But in that moment, everything clicked. The heaviness, the fear, the voice. It wasn’t just my imagination. I had felt something real.

But even as Sam spoke, a part of me recoiled at the idea that it was simply the spirit of a drowned boy. That didn’t explain the malice I felt — the cold, deliberate movement of the chair, or the whisper that felt more like a command than comfort. No, what haunted that house wasn’t innocent or confused. I’ve come to believe that the boy’s death wasn’t the source of the presence — but rather the trigger. That the pain and grief left in the wake of his drowning cracked something open… and something else came through. Something darker. Something that fed on sorrow.

The presence I felt that night wasn’t mourning.

It was hungry.

For years, I’d convinced myself my memory was flawed — that I’d exaggerated or misremembered it as a kid. But after Sam’s confirmation, I knew the truth: what happened to me in that room was real.

Even now, as I write this, that same familiar dread creeps in. I can still hear the scrape of metal on the floor. Still feel the icy air against my skin.

I still see that cracked closet door… in my mind’s eye… slightly ajar, waiting.
