Hey guys.

I’m coming to this site because i recently had a unexplainable experience, and i need some advice., or at least conformation that what occurred at number 13 Stoney lane was a figment of me and my good friend Asher’s imaginations, though I’m sure it could well have been due to the drugs we were taking at the time,as young, stupid people do. But some things that happened were too…real….to have been a hallucination.





Anyway…I’ll stop my rambling get into the story.



Summer of 2019.



I had just turned 24 and was looking to leave home and branch out on my own. So when my good friend Asher suggested we go in together on a house or apartment i agreed, somewhat cautiously. 

Asher said he had seen a house not far from our small rural Devon town (no, I won’t tell you which one) that was for sale for an affordable price and had nearly half an acre of garden. Of course, I immediately assumed this was far too good to be true, so i called up BlueBird stage agents LTD.



ME: hello there, can i ask about a property viewing, please?

EA: which property, miss?

ME: 13 Stoney lane, Devon

EA: …oh…that…

ME: what do you mean..?

EA: nothing, miss. nothing at all. a viewing you said?

ME: yes, please…i can do this weekend, if thats ok?

EA: yes, that will do nicely. Saturday?

ME: ok…

EA: 2:00PM?

ME: no problem at all.

EA: ok, see you then, miss.

ME: thank you, goodbye.



i hung up the call, my excitement quickly drowning out the strange aspects of the conversation.

I then called up Asher to tell him the news.





ME: hey, dude, were viewing the house on Saturday!

ASH: thats great, bro! i can’t wait, have you looked at the pictures?

ME: yeah, its a lovely old house, though the price is low for such a beautiful old house..

ASH: the owners probably want a fast sale, don’t be a karen, Sparky.

ME: ok, ok…i’ll stop..





after that we had a long conversation about other things, and then hung up.



Saturday, 23rd of August 2019



Me and Asher pulled onto the badly tarmacked road, swerving carefully around the many potholes.

the house hazed into view, standing alone on a scruffy plot of land. There was a garage, overgrown swing in the front garden, and a general look of abandonment. A crooked “FOR SALE” sign stood outside. We pulled up in the drive and waited for the estate agent. I looked up at the red brick home, feeling a sudden and irrational chill in my spine, which i ignored, putting it down to the strange absence of noise. There were no major roads nearby, so the only sounds were the rustle and soft clatter of dry grasses in the field across the road and the far off crash and thunder of the sea. A gull cried shrilly, making us both nearly leap out of our skins. The sound was haunting, almost sad, almost…human…it went to 2.54PM and the estate agent still hadn’t showed up, so we decided to try and peek through the windows of the house.

We walked round, shading our eyes to look in the window. The rooms were quaint and old fashioned, and strangely sad. The decor looked pre World War 2, and there were brighter spots on the flowery wallpaper where pictures must have once hung. 

In the kitchen was a blue Aga stove, infact, the newest thing in the room was a 70s style gas cooker, ugly and blocky, and strangely pristine. We went round into the overgrown garden and looked through the double glazed window into the sitting-room, it had similar wallpaper to the kitchen, and the same bright spots, the sign of where pictures had hung. the floor was solid oak, and there was a stain in the corner, dark brown on the already dark wood. At the time, the worst case scenario in my mind was a water leak.

We walked back to the car to try to call the agent, chatting casually. I picked up my phone from the console and pressed the power button. The screen stayed dark. Funny….I was sure I had charged it to full before leaving. Asher checked his phone too, finding it also unresponsive. Strange…but, of course, we brushed it off as a coincidence. 

Seeing a farmhouse a little way down the road we walked toward it, deciding to ask the residents about Number 13, Stoney cottage.



I knocked on the door, which was opened by a old lady, with a wrinkled face, white hair and a knitted shawl. A old border collie dog stood at her heels.



ME: Hello, ma’am..

OW: Hello…who are you..? Are you local?!

ME: um…were looking at buying the house down the road. We would appreciate it if you could tell us a bit about the place?

OW: (she begins to cross herself, in a state of extreme fear) Dear God!!! Don’t go there!! Stay far, far away from that place! A great evil happened there!

ME: Ma’am, are you alright?

OW: (slams the door in our faces. I heard the lock click)





I turned to Asher, frowning. The old woman was clearly suffering some sort of Altzimers disease. 



ME: should we try to help her?

ASH: no, we should leave her. we don’t want to frighten her more. She’s probably not used to strangers.

ME: good point. but its sad to see her so upset.

ASH: its none of our business, mate.



we walked slowly back to my truck, feeling sad for the clearly isolated and lonely old woman.

I checked my phone. Dead, nothing.

We kicked the old truck into life and headed for the main road back into town, only passing a few fields of sheep and an abandoned cottage. 



as soon as we hit the main road, my phone started pinging and buzzing, suddenly alive, the battery ay 89PerCent. Asher’s phone was similarly active. 

I pulled up outside my parents house and grabbed the phone from the console of my truck, the screen is crammed with messages.

There all from the same, unknown number. They all said “Surrender to the lord” I assumed, quite reasonably that this was some religious society looking for new people to convert. Being a staunch agnostic, I deleted the messages and turned to Asher, seeing he had the exact same message on his phone. He was also deleting them.

I decided to ring BlueBird Estate Agents.



ME: Hello?

EA: Hello, BlueBird Estate agents, how can we help?

ME: I was booked in to view 13 Stoney Road, Devon, but nobody showed…

EA: I’m sorry, miss. were very short staffed at the moment. Did you like the property?

ME: actually, we would like to put an offer in.

EA: yes?

ME: can we offer asking price?

EA: of course, I will get back to you on Monday to tell you if the offer is accepted.

ME: thank you

EA: no problem.



I ended the call, and looked over at Asher, who was mirroring my exited expression. We parted ways, heading to our parents houses.





Tuesday, 7th September.





The offer was accepted. We had packed our posesions and got in my truck. The drive took longer than i remembered, or maybe it was just exitement. We pulled up outside our new home, the keys jangled softly in Asher’s hand as he climbed out.

We walked up to the door, unlocking it. It creaked eerily as it slowly opened. The interior smelled stale, with a very faint background odour of rot. We trooped in, eagerly exploring the rooms. We walked through the old rooms, talking happily, our voices echoing through the dusty space. We stopped outside a recessed door, which we knew led to the small basement, we both shuddered slightly.

We walked by, both formulating a reason not to head down there.





LATER THAT EVENING





We had been there around 4 hours or so, bringing in our small amount of furniture and belongings, and arguing over who had what bedrooms, it was beginning to get dark, deep, velvety black with no stars to be seen and a low fog creeping in from the coast.

I was saying something to Asher about food when we began to hear a faint sound, it was fleeting, so fleeting that it could have easily been our imagination. We both paused our conversation and listened intently…nothing. I shrugged and carried on talking.





ME: ok…probably rats…anyway, what food did we bring?

ASH: I think we have a pack of noodles…hopefully its not rats…

ME: ok. are they in the car?

ASH: yeah, in the crate.





I walked out of the room to the front door. I pushed it open. it creaked on its rusting hinges as it swung open. I walked out into the pitch black night, the darkness surrounded me like a living thing. The fog felt like groping, clammy hands…I pushed away the irrational fear. I wasn’t a little kid anymore. The monster under the bed did not exist. There was no such thing as skin walkers. I was being foolish. It was just the dark, and it was hardly like we were in Leeds city centre…this was rural Devon for goodness sake…but the fear persisted.

I opened the back of the car and began to rummage for the packet of noodles. I was repeating “THERES NOTHING OUT HERE” over and over in my head. I located the noodles, pulled them out and shut the boot of my car, for some reason I felt scared to make a noise.

But the boot of my old Ford truck needed a good slam to shut it properly, so I was forced to thud it hard. The noise echoed oddly, and I shuddered. As I began to walk back to the house I was sure I heard footsteps behind me. I put this down to my exhaustion, but I still hurried my steps back to the house. I reached for the doorknob, which was slick and wet from the fog. I pulled it, it wouldn’t budge. I rattled it, beginning to panic. I could swear I felt hot, fetid breath on the back of my neck…”ASH!!! LET ME IN!!” I yelled at the top of my lungs. I heard footsteps and the door flew open. I fell inside, scrabbling and slipping, terrified.



ME: THERE’S SOMETHING OUT THERE!!

ASH: whoa, whoa! chill, there’s nothing out there. your imagining things, sissy…

ME: I felt it’s damn breath on my neck!!

ASH: (sighs) don’t shit me, bro. there’s nothing out there but a goddamn fog.

ME: but..but…

ASH: (sighs again) come inside, then the boogieman or whatever can’t get you..





we walked inside, I cast several wary looks over my shoulder, expecting to see burning yellow eyes boring into my back. Nothing. Of course there was nothing. Monsters did not exist.







END OF PART ONE.
