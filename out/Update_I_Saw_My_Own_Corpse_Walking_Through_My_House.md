I should’ve left the gas station. I should’ve called someone—anyone—but I didn’t. Instead, I stared into the bathroom mirror, willing my reflection to blink.

It didn’t.

I squeezed my eyes shut, counting to three. When I opened them again, my reflection was still there, wide-eyed, unblinking. But now it was smiling.

I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the trash bin. My phone buzzed in my pocket, making me jump. My hands were trembling so badly it took me two tries to pull it out.

Unknown number.

I stared at the screen for a moment before answering.

“Hello?” My voice came out hoarse.

At first, there was nothing. Then, barely above a whisper:

“Where are you going?”

I froze. The voice was mine. Exactly mine. Same pitch. Same rasp of terror. I turned and stared at the mirror. My reflection was holding a phone to its ear.

I slowly lowered my hand. The reflection didn’t. It just kept staring, grinning wide, the phone still pressed against its face.

“Stop,” I choked out. My voice cracked.

“Why?” she whispered softly into the phone.
Then she added, almost playfully:
“I’m already here.”

The line went dead.

And then my reflection blinked.

I sprinted out of the bathroom, shoving through the gas station door so hard the cashier yelped. I barely noticed. My legs were weak, shaking violently, but I ran. Out into the humid night, down the cracked sidewalk. The streetlights buzzed overhead.

Somewhere behind me, I heard the faint sound of bare feet slapping against pavement.

I didn’t look back.

I finally made it to my friend Katie’s apartment. By the time I reached her door, my feet were raw, my breaths coming in ragged gasps. I banged on the door, frantic.

“Jesus, hang on!” Katie’s voice was groggy. It took her a second to unlock the door. When she opened it, her eyes widened. “What the hell—”

I shoved past her, slamming the door shut behind me. I braced my hands against it, panting, trying to catch my breath.

“Katie, I—” I struggled to get the words out. My throat burned. “I need you to lock all the windows. Right now.”

“What?” She blinked, clearly still half-asleep. “What’s going on?”

I grabbed her shoulders. “Just do it, okay? Please.”

Something about my voice—my face—made her eyes narrow with concern. She nodded and walked through the apartment, locking windows, drawing the blinds. As I found the nearest phone charger.

When she came back, she folded her arms across her chest. “Okay. Now tell me what the hell is going on.”

I opened my mouth to explain, but the words caught in my throat. How was I supposed to say it?
Hey, there’s an evil version of me wearing my face and she doesn’t blink.

Instead, I just whispered, “I’m being followed.” 

Her face softened. She stepped closer, resting her hands on my arms. “By who? Should I call the cops?”

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to beg her to call 911 and scream into the phone that someone was wearing my face. But what would they do? What could they do? Arrest my reflection?

“No,” I mumbled. “It’s… complicated.”

Her eyes narrowed. “You’re freaking me out.”

Before I could respond, there was a soft knock at the door.

Katie turned toward it.

“Did you bring someone with you?” she asked.

I shook my head violently. My stomach turned to ice.

The knock came again. Softer this time.

“Katie, don’t—”

But she was already walking toward the door.

“Relax,” she muttered, peeking through the peephole. Then she turned back to me, confused.
“There’s no one there.”

My mouth went dry. I took a step back.

Katie pulled the door halfway open. 

Bare, muddy footprints trailed across her welcome mat.

She frowned. “What the hell—”

The door ripped open making a ear deafening boom as it and along with Katie slammed into the wall.

Before i could even comprehend what just happened Katie’s unconscious body was yanked into the hall with such force it had to have broken something.

“NO!” I lunged for her, but something slammed into me—something that felt exactly like my own body.

We hit the floor hard. I thrashed, kicking and flailing, but my attacker’s grip was inhumanly strong. I craned my neck and stared into my own eyes. My face was stretched in a ghoulish grin.

she whispered breathlessly into my ear. “Your so much fun”

Before I could even react both palms of her hands crashed into my ears the pain and the ringing was unbearable.

I fell back putting my hands over my ears as if it could even begin to help with the ringing.

I looked down the hall Katie‘s feet we’re scraping against the hardwood as she was dragged away towards the stairs.

“LET HER GO!” I shrieked

I had to give one last Hail Mary, I mustered up every ounce of strength I had and charged directly into her. Bringing her to the ground a second time, I began to claw at my double’s face. 

My nails tore into her cheek, but she didn’t bleed. The skin just split open like brittle paper, revealing raw, blackened flesh underneath.

“Shhh.” Her voice was soft.
“You’ll ruin it.”

And then she kissed my forehead.

I must have blacked out, because when I open my eyes I was on Katie‘s living room floor.

Katie was gone.

The apartment was empty. The front door still wide open with the handle indented into the drywall. 

I stumbled out into the hall, screaming her name. But there was no trace of her. Just the muddy footprints leading down the hallway and out the back exit.

I ran after them, barefoot and trembling.

The prints led into the woods behind the complex. I didn’t stop to think—I just kept running.

Deeper and deeper into the trees.

That’s when I saw her.

Katie.

She was standing perfectly still beneath a crooked oak tree. Her back was turned to me. I slowed, my heart thundering in my chest.

“Katie?” I called out.

She didn’t move.

I stepped closer. “Hey. It’s me. Are you—”

She turned around.

And I saw my own face staring back at me.

Smiling.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs locked up beneath me.

I didn’t move.

As my face was burning into my eyes it took a slow step forward. Her bare feet left black smudges in the dirt. The moonlight glistened off her cracked, peeling skin. Her eyes—my eyes—were wide and glimmering with something hungry.

That was enough.
I turned and ran.

I tore through the trees, my bare feet slipping on the damp leaves. Branches lashed at my arms and legs, but I didn’t stop. I could hear her behind me—my footsteps chasing me down. Her breath in my ear.

“Come back,” she cooed softly. My voice.
“You’re going the wrong way.”

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I just ran.

The forest was darker now, closing in on me. I didn’t know where I was going—I just knew I had to keep moving. My lungs screamed. My legs shook violently. But I didn’t stop.

And then, just as I felt my knees threatening to give out, I saw it—
Headlights.

I stumbled out of the woods and onto a winding stretch of road. A car was coming. Fast.

I sprinted toward it, flailing my arms. My throat was raw, but I screamed anyway.

“STOP! PLEASE!”

The car screeched to a halt, tires skidding. The driver—a man in his 40s—threw the door open and jumped out. His eyes widened when he saw me, disheveled and barefoot, trembling violently.

“Jesus Christ—are you okay?!” he asked, voice sharp with concern.

I couldn’t speak. I just nodded frantically, then shook my head. My mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. My legs buckled. I dropped to my knees on the asphalt, sobbing.

He crouched beside me, pulling out his phone.
“Hey, it’s okay. You’re safe now. I’m calling 911.”

Safe.

The word barely registered.

I clutched his arm with trembling fingers, my nails digging into his skin. I glanced over my shoulder, expecting to see her—my twin, my shadow—stepping out of the trees. Grinning. Reaching.

But the woods were empty.
Dark and still.

I let out a ragged breath and collapsed into the man’s arms, barely registering the distant sound of sirens.

woke up in a hospital bed.

The fluorescent lights made my eyes ache. My head pounded violently, and my throat felt like sandpaper. A nurse was standing beside me, gently adjusting the IV in my arm.

“You’re safe,” she said softly. Her voice was calm, reassuring. “You were dehydrated and in shock, but you’re going to be okay.”

I tried to speak, but my voice cracked. The nurse offered me a cup of ice water. My hands were still shaking when I took it.

“Your friend Katie,” the nurse added carefully.
“She’s… still missing.”

I squeezed the cup until it nearly cracked.

The nurse placed a hand on my shoulder. “The police found signs of a struggle in her apartment. They’re doing everything they can.”

I nodded weakly, but my chest tightened. I knew they wouldn’t find her.

Because she wasn’t missing.

She was wearing my face.

I stayed at the hospital for two days. I spoke with the police. They asked questions I couldn’t answer. I told them about the gas station, the woods, Katie being dragged away. But I left out the other part.

The part about her.

I knew they wouldn’t believe me.
Hell, I barely believed me.

The hospital discharged me into the care of my sister, Lauren. She drove me to her house in the next town over. Her guest room was small but cozy. Warm blankets. Soft lighting. A lock on the door.

She made me tea and sat with me for hours, holding my hand and speaking softly. She didn’t push. She didn’t ask for details. She just stayed.

And for the first time in days, I felt safe.

But the feeling didn’t last.

That night, after Lauren had gone to bed, I locked the guest room door. I slid a chair in front of it. My phone was on the nightstand, fully charged. I stared at it for a long time, unsure if I should call the police.

Instead, I walked into the bathroom.

I flicked on the light.

The mirror was fogged from the shower Lauren had taken earlier. I wiped it clean with the sleeve of my hoodie.

And stared at my reflection.

My face was pale. My eyes were puffy and bloodshot. I was exhausted.

But I blinked.

I blinked.

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding. A weak, shuddering laugh escaped me.

I was okay.
I was safe.

I turned off the bathroom light and climbed into bed. The mattress was warm. The blankets were soft.

And as I drifted into an uneasy sleep, I must have not noticed her, Watching me from the space beneath the closet door.

I knew it had to have been in there, due to the same black mud that was illuminated in the early morning light, ruining the tan carpet that perfectly complemented this now once, comforting, safe, room.
