I took my masters degree in HR management.

At the time, it felt like a very sensible thing to choose, and I was proud that I chose it.

I put my head down, studied hard and aced the exams. Coming out of it all with a car and a little apartment, which is a lot more than some people I knew.

I also had a job working for an online retailer. My first proper professional job as a HR administrator. I even had an office.

It wasn't a huge company, but it was growing fast. They needed more staff to help keep the cogs spinning. And that was me.

I must admit, my briefing by the CEO gave me conflicting feelings. Let's just call him Andy for now.

He referred to the staff in the warehouse as "grunts" on more than one occasion. Talking a lot about how he wanted to expand into furniture and electrical goods, how he wanted to be the next Amazon. How I could eventually be the Head of Human Resources in a giant conglomerate.

I took his words with a pinch of salt, but a part of me was with him; I *did* want to progress in my career, I *did* want to be part of something big.

Over the passing weeks and months, I got to know the warehouse staff.

Among them - Olly - a shy teenager who had come in through a recent government programme.

Andy loved the government programmes, as they subsidised the wages. I would realise pretty quickly how much he loved anything which cut costs, even by a little bit.

To the point of patrolling the packing bays, reminding the staff of the exact cost per centimetre of tape.

Me and Olly met up once a week. He was almost too shy to speak at times, and at others he was very articulate about how he felt.

He liked playing video games, and lived in a council house with his mother. 

He confessed to being bullied by some of the other workers. He spoke of one time a group found him walking home after work and teased him all the way through town. Taking the piss out of his height, the way he talked with a slight lisp, his right eye and how it moved to the side sometimes without his control.

I felt bad for Olly, and I wondered to myself whether he was really ready to be in a place like this.

There seemed to be a common complaint from all the warehouse staff, though, and that was the wobbly ladders; the pickers used them to fetch product from the top shelves, which were very high up.

When I brought it up to Andy, he told me he'd replace all the ladders after the warehouse relocation in a few month's time. I found out soon after there'd been no health and safety checks... ever.

"We have to act quickly." Were Andy's words in the Team meeting. "We either grow with the demand or we plateau and accept mediocrity."

The company was in a transitional period. It needed more fulfilment space. More staff. More product.

And, a change in work culture.

"Those idiots get away with murder in there. I watch them standing about like lemons every time I walk in." Andy complained to me in a private meeting between us. "I'm not gonna sugar coat it. I want you to report back to me what they're saying. See who's with the company and see who doesn't give a shit."

Along with this covert addition to my role, I was to head up a productivity spreadsheet to "weed out the slackers". Because we didn't want slackers in the new warehouse.

We wanted a positive work culture that promoted diligence and integrity.

Meanwhile, Olly was showing up to our meetings with bruises. He shrugged off the matter, but I could tell there was a deep inner struggle.

A part of me yearned to reach out and help him. But I just didn't know what to do, other than my job.

One evening, after a couple of glasses of wine, I burst into tears on a phone call with my mother. I sobbed uncontrollably, telling her I hated the job, how horrible it was. Then it was back to work.

I soon had to write some difficult emails. Not everyone was hitting the new productivity quota and picking enough units, packing enough orders.

One of them - Mandy - cried in front of me. As streams of tears ran down her cheeks, I thought to myself whether my heart was really in this job. But then I'd receive my paycheque at the end of the month. Then I'd see my friends working at Starbucks, complaining about how "unfair the system is", and I consoled myself with what I had.

It took a while, but I became used to suppressing my feelings. I think that's when the job truly became the job. Also, maybe some of Andy was rubbing off on me.

A part of me enjoyed the way I was running the show behind the scenes. My covert operations, helping to improve the company output and let go of the weaker members.

Then, one afternoon, there was an accident in the warehouse.

Someone had fallen off one of the ladders and brutally injured themselves.

After hearing about it, I rushed into Andy's office, who was in a call. He seemed to be in a cheery mood, while I was panicking.

After finishing on the phone, he told me immediately not to worry. "We're dealing with it." He said bluntly, ushering me out of the office with his silence.

I read Andy's statement in the local newspaper a day later. The fall had been fatal.

"Olly was a hard worker. It is with a heavy heart that we deliver news of this tragic accident..."

The next time I stepped foot in the warehouse, all the old ladders had been replaced.
