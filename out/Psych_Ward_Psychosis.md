I woke up in a panic, something that has been happening a lot lately. My dreams - well, more like nightmares - have been getting more realistic, like they are going to come to fruition at any moment. I never thought I would be put in a position, at almost thirty years old, to be on the brink of a psychotic snap.

I force myself out of bed, staying as quiet as possible so as to not wake my roommates. The hospital is always quiet at this time of night. There are no clocks to be seen except for one in the nurse's office and one in the alcove, right outside the nurse’s station. I don’t need a clock to tell me what time it is though, as these “dreams” happen at the same time every night. I walk down toward the alcove with my notebook and pen in hand. “3am writing session?” The nurse asked as I walked past the door of the nurse’s station. I nodded, still shaking the grogginess of sleep out of my head so I could focus on what I was getting ready to write.

Most of the time I couldn’t remember the scenes I had just dreamt about, so I would write whatever I was feeling, or something random, depending on my night. For some reason though, this particular night, I remembered the nightmare. I sat down in my normal spot, getting myself as comfortable as possible in the hard, heavy, plastic chairs. Pen poised to write, I saw something out of the corner of my eye heading past me toward the tv room. I looked up at the nurses and techs to see if they had noticed, but they didn’t even pick their heads up from what they were looking at.

After a minute of watching the nurses and turning my head to see if whoever, or whatever, I saw would come back the other way, nothing happened. I turned my head back to my notebook, finally starting to write my story when I noticed the shadow figure that had passed before walking the other way, right past the nurse’s station. I checked again to see if they would notice, and yet again, nothing. I closed my notebook and got up to follow whoever was walking by. I stayed a little behind, trying not to alert whoever it was, but as they turned into the sunroom at the end of the hall, they turned their head to look at me. The face was a black smoke with eyes as red as blood. The body changed to have the same smokey appearance as the face. It lifted what I presume to be a hand and clearly waved me to it, wanting me to follow into the sunroom.

I started to move toward it, thinking that nothing could happen as there were cameras everywhere. I was walking slowly and as I got closer, the shadow moved into the sunroom, seeming to be moving backward. I made it to the doorway, put one step inside and suddenly felt like I was freezing. I dropped my notebook there in the doorway and wrapped my arms around myself to keep warm. I took another step into the sunroom. That is the last thing I remember before waking up in my hospital bed with a tech sitting and watching me. “Wha…what happened?” I asked the tech, hoping it would jog some memories. “You don’t remember?” The tech asked me, looking concerned. “No,” I said.

The tech left the room for a moment to go get one of the nurses, leaving me with nothing but my thoughts. Presumably before putting me in bed, they took everything but a blanket and pillow. I must have done something bad if I didn’t even get sheets or any of my other belongings, like my clothes or a toothbrush. My nurse came into the room saying “nice to see you awake, do you remember anything from last night?” I told her everything I remembered - how I woke up at 3am, went to sit in the alcove to write, kept seeing the shadow figure and then, nothing after stepping into the sunroom. The nurse looked at me and I could see in her face how worried she was.

“What happened to me? Why did I wake up on full suicide watch? What did I do?” I fired the questions out in quick succession, not allowing time for answers between. I was on the verge of a panic attack when the nurse finally started to answer my questions. “Well, we aren’t sure of exactly what happened to you, but when you got into the sunroom, you started throwing yourself against the walls and windows, seemingly trying to break one of the windows. You became a danger to yourself, that’s why we had to put you on full watch.” I sat silently, stunned by what the nurse just told me, then realizing how many bruises I had, specifically on my arms and sides. Was the shadow responsible for this?

“You dropped your notebook in the doorway of the sunroom, so we have it back in the nurse’s station. You seem to be ok now so we will drop your watch to 15 minute checks.” The nurse turned and walked out of the room. Should I tell the tech about the show figure having the deep red eyes and that I feel like that's what made me do what I did? I still had so many questions, but I was too shocked and tired to ask anything else right now. I laid back down and went back to sleep, hoping I would have some peaceful sleep, at least for a little while.

After what only felt like a few minutes, I woke up to see that it was dark out again, so I knew it was sometime at night. At least this time I didn’t wake up from a dream or nightmare. I got up and headed out to the nurse’s station to get my notebook, maybe writing about it would help. I stopped and asked for my notebook and took up my spot in the alcove, determined to ignore the shadow figure if it decided to make another appearance tonight. Looking at the clock, I noted it was only 11:30pm, then I started writing everything I remembered from the night before.
