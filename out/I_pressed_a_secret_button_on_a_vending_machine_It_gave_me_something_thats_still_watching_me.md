I don’t even know why I went to that bus station.

It was 2:47 AM. Middle of nowhere. The place looked abandoned—like it had been peeled out of time and left to rot in a pocket dimension.

Cracked tile. Buzzing lights. The smell of warm soda, mildew, and something sweeter, like rotting jellybeans.

And there it was.
The vending machine.

It didn’t belong there.
It looked older than the building around it. The glass was warped. The buttons had letters and numbers that seemed to shift slightly when I looked away. There was no brand name—just flickering static where the screen should be, and rows of snacks I didn’t recognize.

“Whispered Peanuts.”
“Bitter Chews.”
“Morsels of Regret.”
“Granny’s Wet Mints.”

The longer I stared, the more I felt like I remembered those names. Like I’d seen them in dreams I forgot on purpose.

I put in a dollar and hit B7.

The machine made a sound I can only describe as… wet breathing. Then it dropped a bag:

Whisper Crispies.

They looked like potato chips—thin, greasy, glimmering with a faint rainbow sheen like oil on water. I ate one.

As soon as I crunched down, I heard a whisper—not in my ears, but behind my eyes. Not a voice I knew. Not even a language.
But I understood it anyway.

“Do not look at the mirror in the train station bathroom after 3:13 AM,” it said. “He watches.”

I swallowed. My hands were shaking. I looked down. The bag was empty.
I hadn’t eaten them all.
I’d only had one.

Something else… finished them.

Then I pressed A8. Couldn’t stop myself.

Granny’s Wet Mints.
The packaging looked like it had been sewn shut with a child’s hair. Damp. Warm. The mints inside glistened. One of them blinked.

Stitched into the bag was a message:

Eat one if you miss someone dead.

Eat two if you want them back.

Eat three if you're ready to join them.
(Don’t eat four. Please.)

I ate five.

Mint 1: I remembered someone I’ve never known—Great-Aunt Petunia. She wore lavender and collected porcelain eyes. My heart ached for her.

Mint 2: I heard the creak of her cane in my hallway. She was humming a lullaby made of numbers.

Mint 3: My body began to flicker. I lost my weight. My outline. My self.

Mint 4: She appeared. Not as a person. As a shape. Smiling. Teeth like keys. Eyes like doorways. Bones bending like ribbon.

Mint 5: I was gone. Sitting in a wicker chair under a sky of black glass. Watching a garden grow backward. The flowers opened into buds. Bees crawled into their own hives in reverse. A vending machine stood across the lawn, rusted over with names I didn’t know I’d written.

That’s when I saw it.
A button near the bottom of the machine.

No label. Just a soft, sticky click.
A hidden compartment slid open.

Inside: a piece of taffy.
Wrapped in wax paper so yellowed it looked fossilized. Written in red crayon:

DO NOT CHEW.

A note fell from the folds:

*Swallow whole for a second chance.*
*Spit out for the truth.*
*Chew… and stay forever.*

I spit it out.

The taffy hit the ground and twitch-spasmed like a dying beetle. A wet sigh echoed from the ceiling tiles.

Then it showed me the truth.

The machine wasn’t built. It was grown.
Every snack a seed. Every purchase a trade.
It doesn’t want money. It wants curiosity. Cravings. Cracks in your sanity.

The vending machine is part of something older than cities. Older than language. It’s not evil.
It’s lonely.

When I blinked again, I was back.

Bus station. 2:47 AM.
The machine was normal. Pepsi. Lays. Twinkies. Nothing strange.

But my pockets were heavier.

Inside:

One untouched purple taffy. Still warm.

A coin with a hole in the middle and an eye that never blinks.

A note:
*Don’t come back. Unless you’re lonely.*

I haven’t touched the taffy. But sometimes, I dream of chewing it.
And when I wake up?

I can still taste mint.
