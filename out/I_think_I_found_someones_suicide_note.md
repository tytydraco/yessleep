It was hidden behind the old wallpaper when redecorating. I didn't get any information about deaths or suicides in the property before, so I need to investigate.

The note was a poem, written in quite an old-fashioned way, and on clearly old, thick paper. Here's what it said:

"Oh, the cruel hand of fate doth beckon me,  
To venture forth into the great unknown,  
Where shadows dance and whispers fill the air,  
And life's ephemeral flame shall soon be blown.  
What lies beyond this mortal coil, I ponder,  
As I stand upon the precipice of time,  
To leave behind this world of joys and sorrows,  
And step into the realm of the sublime.  
Doth heaven's gate await with open arms,  
To welcome me with celestial embrace?  
Or doth the abyss of oblivion loom,  
A void where all existence is effaced?  
Like a flickering candle in the night,  
My flame grows weaker with each passing breath,  
And as the final moments draweth nigh,  
I'm bound to face the sting of bitter death.  
Oh, how I long to cling to life's sweet embrace,  
To taste the fruits of love and joy once more,  
To feel the warmth of sunlight on my face,  
And wander on this earthly realm I adore.  
But alas, the hourglass hath run its course,  
And I must bid adieu to mortal coil,  
To leave behind the cherished bonds I've formed,  
And venture forth into the unknown soil.  
Shall I be remembered, I often wonder,  
When I'm naught but a whisper in the wind?  
Will my name be etched upon the annals,  
Or fade away as time's waves crash and rescind?  
Yet, in the face of this impending end,  
I find solace in the tapestry of life,  
For though my mortal frame may turn to dust,  
My spirit shall transcend the mortal strife.  
The memories I've woven, the love I've shared,  
Shall linger in the hearts of those I leave,  
A legacy that time cannot erase,  
A testament to the life I did conceive.  
So, let not sorrow cloud the final hour,  
Nor fear of death cast shadows on my soul,  
For in this fleeting moment, I shall find,  
The courage to embrace life's final toll.  
And as I embark upon this sacred journey,  
To realms unseen, beyond the mortal veil,  
I'll face the great unknown with open heart,  
And breathe my last, with courage that won't fail.  
Farewell, dear world, and all that I hold dear,  
I bid thee adieu with a heavy heart,  
But know that in the whispers of the wind,  
A part of me shall linger and impart.  
For death, though dark, is but a passage, friend,  
To realms where mysteries unravel true,  
And as I take my final breath, I know,  
That life's eternal cycle shall renew."

No name was signed at the end. I am now making it my mission to find out who wrote it, when and what happened to them. I don't believe in ghosts, but my house feels different now. Colder; the air thicker.
