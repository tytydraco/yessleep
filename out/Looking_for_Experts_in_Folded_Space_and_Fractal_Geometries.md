I need help and I don't know where else to turn but here. I know some people on this sub have had encounters with strange spaces and I'm hoping they might be able to offer some useful advice to someone in my particular situation.

The situation; I am an urban explorer. It's just a hobby, really. I like going places where people don't usually go. Abandoned buildings. Narrow alleys. Construction areas. So on. Yeah, that sometimes involves trespassing but I've never gotten more than a yell from a security guard for that kind of thing. Last week I was downtown (I don't feel comfortable saying in which city) and I found an alley I hadn't seen before, which was weird, because it was on a road I go down all the time between two businesses I have actually gone into before. Obviously, I decided to check it out. 

It ended in a brick wall and a turn. That was obvious from the street. Around the turn it kept going. And going. And going. And there were other alleys branching off from the path I could see. It didn't make any sense. That space would have been inside the buildings on that block. And there were metal doors here and there and the signage you'd expect in an urban back alley. Fool that I am, I decided to keep walking. Curiosity carried me forward.

The other alleys were just like the first. They just went on and on. I knew it was wrong. I could feel it in my gut. That sense that I was someplace I didn't belong was shooting right up my spine. A door slammed somewhere behind me and I booked it. Just turned and ran in a dead sprint. I feel no shame in telling you I had gone from curious to terrified in a heartbeat. I didn't think I'd gone far but I must have. I must have taken a wrong turn, because I couldn't find the street. There were just more narrow alleyways. I was lost.

And they were wrong. Signage wasn't making sense. Proportions of doors and trash cans were getting wonky. I saw a few alleys that narrowed until their walls nearly touched. I ran down another that was as wide as a god damned football field.

And I wasn't alone.

Every once in a while in my mad flight I heard other doors slam closed. I once even saw a person go into a door in the distance. I pounded on that door for a moment before I kept going. I felt like there was something behind me. Tailing me. That's what kept me going. Kept me running. Things got a lot more… distorted, before they started getting normal again.

When I was exhausted, right on the brink of collapse, I turned a corner and was on the street again. I didn't stop. Not until I was several blocks away. Then I fell into myself and cried and breathed. It was just a weird alleyway and I didn't even see anything behind me but I was so scared I thought my heart would just quit. That night I slept for a solid thirteen hours. I was just dead to the world. But that's where my problems started. 

You know those "find the difference" pictures? Where two images are similar enough they look the same at first glance, but then when you look closer you start to find little differences? 

My first clue was two days after my mad dash. I went to work, still shaken, and tried to act normal, so I made a comment when the radio started playing a really good song I didn't know. I asked a coworker about it, hoping for a distraction, and he looked at me like I had lobsters coming out of my ears. It was, apparently, "Best of You" by the Foo Fighters. 

"Who the fuck are the Foo Fighters?"

That was my follow-up question. That was when I started to realize just how much I fucked up.

Apparently, Kurt Cobain killed himself in 1994 and Dave Grohl then went on to start his own band. Nirvana only made three albums. Not six. Also; Buzz Aldrin wasn't the first man on the moon, the United Kingdom's flag is a god damned mess and for some reason no one knows who Willis Ochoa is. How the fuck has no one heard of Ochoa? Every day I find more and more differences between the world I know and this place you call home.

I do not belong here, and I think the people around me know that on some deep, primal level. I went back to that alley and it was gone. The two buildings it ran between are right up against one another, sharing a wall. It's fucking gone.

My coworkers are getting irrationally angry when I'm around. My friends are excluding me from everything. Even people on the street are starting to glare. It's like I'm a piece from a different puzzle just shoved into place. I look like I fit, but I don't. I'm lonely. I'm scared. I'm worried that people are going to start getting violent and that, when they do, no one will lift a finger to help me. How long until some random person – or even a cop – just straight up attacks me?

I need help from someone experienced in folded space and fractal geometries. Clearly, the path I took was… weird. Is there any way to find paths like that on purpose? Or to induce them to appear? How can I navigate if I get back inside? 

Please, I'm a person. Not some *thing* pretending to be human. I am as real to my earth as you are to yours and I'm hoping that the Internet will provide some degree of separation between us. That you can read this message and not feel the growing hostility of the people I meet in person.

I just want to go home.
