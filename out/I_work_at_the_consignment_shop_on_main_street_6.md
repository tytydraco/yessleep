Demeter is pissed. She’s grounded for killing… something small, bloody and full of an unknown wood-shaving like material and dragging it into bed this morning.

Punishment? No library or cafe or laundromat today. The bubble backpack will stay by the door to mock her.

I’m going to finish my breakfast and head out but I had a thought. Remember twin peaks? That tv show on in the 1990s with Kyle Mc-something? He was also Paul from Dune. They had spooky shit and a saw mill too. However, I don’t think ours is owned by a smokeshow from Hong Kong. I don’t really know who owns it. Probably the Shriner family honestly. They own most of the town anyway.

Ok, topics to research today:

The actual account of the town founding ⭕️

The statue in town and who it’s based off of ⭕️

What makes the trees here so special ⭕️

Mass hysteria ⭕️

Shriner family history ⭕️

The mill ⭕️

The mall opening that never happened ⭕️

How far can I get? We shall see.

Just me, my saffron latte and a basement of microfiche films against the world today. But I did learn a few things.

First, how to use microfiche.

Second, I was right. The mill is owned by the Shriner family. Specifically, it was owned by Franklin and their cousin Alan, the one who worked with Rooter on the mall deal. Both basically disappeared after the whole incident. It’s the only shared property in the family but it was divided weirdly. So the building, the equipment and the trees are all owned by Franklin. But the land itself is owned by Alan. He built the mall on a patch that had been clear cut by Franklin. They had a spat to put it nicely, and it got really ugly. When the mill burned, Franklin suspected Alan, but disappeared before anything really came out of it. When the family decided to push off the mall opening, Alan vanished too so they decided to keep it closed to save face.

So:

Ok, next, the mill itself. The saw mill was built in 1900, and was the first major job producer in the area. Built by Albiticus Shriner, who was a bit of a cornball to say the least. Despite being a heavily Catholic area surrounding his mill, he was a follower of Aleister Crowley. That’s right folks, the sexual deviant master of debauchery himself. Now, I don’t quite understand how he got into this, but after following the master of disaster’s teachings for a while he started his own church.

I know, I know, how on the nose. A cult founded small town. OooOOOooo

But when he started his own church, he started praying to the forest that surrounded the mill. He preached about a figure named Divicianna. He didn’t continue the sexual deviancy of Crowley, so he gets a few brownie points.

Divicianna blessed the woods to grow strong and fast as long as she was respected. Remember the other day when I said there’s something special about our lumber? It’s not the lumber, it’s the trees themselves. They’re related to red oak trees but they’ve mutated to grow to full height within ten years without sucking all the life out of the dirt. So, they’re constantly producing trees fit for lumber without absolutely nuking the forest.

Albiticus somehow knew these trees were special and decided to build his mill here. It was a small endeavor to begin with, basically a camp with 20 men and their families in tents. People settled in 1903 and our cozy little town was born.  Come 1910, the singular religious establishment was a one room church for Divicianna, built from her own trees. She is Divincianna. He paid for a statue to be built in bronze for her in the center of town. So that’s four more checked off our list and one added.

I did send a couple emails out while I was at the library too. One to an arborist, because of the trees. One to a Dendrologist, also because of the trees. One to a local historian, for various reasons. The final one I sent to a folklorist that specializes in lesser deities. Godbless Google man.

Someone was in my house.

I’m waiting outside for the police and Ian, Demeter is confused but content being asleep tucked in my robe.

I thought I was having a nightmare at first, but the shadowy remnants of those always disappear when I open my eyes. This one didn’t.

I was asleep on the couch after that old movie marathon they had airing last night, having my usual nightmare when something in my dream started to beg me to wake up. This gentle feminine voice was pleading that I needed to wake up, but be totally still or I was going to get hurt. Somehow, I managed to pull myself awake and do just that. I opened my eyes, but I stayed totally still. A black figure snuck past the couch by my feet and headed for my room. I heard them opening drawers and shuffling around for something. I pulled my phone out and lowered my brightness before they noticed. Or they didn’t respond to it I guess. I fired off a message to Ian, Cami, and Markus telling them to call the police, and there was someone in my room. Markus responded first with a thumbs up.

The intruder must have found what they were looking for, because as soon as I hid my phone again, they stepped out of my room and headed for the front door. They must of had a sense of humor because they tiptoed across the room like the pink panther, I could almost hear the music score. They slipped out the door as quickly as they came in, leaving black boot prints behind.

You can trace their every step from whatever powder was on their boots, but it never seems to get lighter. Like the powder was being wiped off as they stepped you know? They were just solid black.

I don’t know what they took. I don’t know who they are. I don’t know. There’s the sheriff now. Will update when I can.

Monday, August 11th, 12:00 pm

Nothing productive came out of the police. I wish I could be surprised but I’m too pissed to care. They dusted for prints, took some photos and collected some residue from the footprints.

Ian however, was more than helpful. I’m currently sitting on his couch actually. Demeter is in his window, yelling at his bird feeder.

He showed up about twenty minutes after the cops, still in his jammies and very disleveled. De and I crawled into his car, and I filled him in. He wasn’t exactly one with the earth, so I ended up repeating myself until he got it. Once he gained sentience, he offered me an assumed cigarette, and stepped out to talk to the cops. I don’t smoke, but I took it anyway and lit it. You know what’s funny though? Big, strong, basement ghost beating Ian smokes tea and weed packed into stuff-your-own-cigarettes tubes. Love that for him. I might buy some off him.

So he talks to the cops for a little while, then returns to the car and we pull out.

“We’ll head home, you and De can take my bed and in the morning we’ll go to the city and get some cameras and a new lock. How’s that sound?” He leans back in his seat, and holds out a hand to take my roll-your-own. I offer it to him and nod, glancing at De asleep in the back seat, all curled up in her carrier.

Don’t smoke and drive kids. Park, like a decent degenerate.

We pulled into his place, or his mom’s old place I should say and toddle inside. He and his mother lived in the renovated carriage house on the Shriner property and when he was old enough, he moved back in after she died. It’s a large apartment above a workshop basically, but it’s well kept and still more lux then half the high end apartments in Chicago. He takes Demeter so I can tackle the stairs, and cracks the crate open for her. She slithers out and looks around, knowing her buddy is around somewhere.

Ian keeps a huge pet rabbit, freestyling in his house. I’m talking massive. He’s a Flemish giant named Bruno, that’s litter trained and likes to follow De around like a pining lover. I’ve kept our big eared friend over the years when Ian goes on vacation, so we’re all well acquainted.

They greet each other, and I head off to Ian’s room to try and sleep, the fuzzbuckets both on my tail.

No matter how hard I tried and how tired I was, I didn’t really sleep. I’d nod off just far enough to start to dream and jerk awake, seeing that guy rummaging through my house and smelling rotted wood or swamp. Just something plantlike and decaying. When I heard Ian up and kicking around, I crawled out of bed. The critters were curled up together on the floor, Demeter snoring away as usual.

We had coffee and another roll-your-own in silence before he finally spoke up.

“Any more ghost pipe screams?” He ashes the joint, almost into his mug might I add.

“Nope… a little dust here and there though. Did the cops tell you anything?”

He shook his head and sighs, then offered it over. “Not a thing… but we’ll get cameras up in case they come back.”

I take a swig of my coffee, the thought of a return visit terrifying me. Instead, I decide to change the subject and nod to the joint in his hand. “When did this start?”

“Ah… at eighteen or so?… The car accident messed up my whole…” he waves a hand over his left shoulder, collarbone, neck and head. “So I spent a few years on antidepressants and pain pills but they got to be a problem… I was uh…  by sixteen, I was addicted to oxys… and I was a hellion about it. But those get to be pretty hard to come by in a small town. I moved onto cheaper…more readily available things…” He pushes his sleeve up, showing a handful of pinpoint scars up his forearm. “So… the Ol man notices some silver forks missing before a big gala… he sat me down and told me I’m either going to get my shit together, or I’m going to get out without a dime of my inheritance. I got combative, and after a brief…” he snorts and shakes his head, then takes a slow drawl off his joint. “Basically, he whopped my ass and told me I had five minutes to pack because I was either going to a rehab program or I was out on my ass. I took him up on the rehab. Spent six months in a treatment center and the day I was released, we get T-boned on the way home. I break my collarbone all over again. That one ends up in surgery, and I rawdogged recovery. Not even a Tylenol…”

At this point he moves his collar to show a neat little scar on his chest.

“That was miserable but I was so scared of getting bad again, I wasn’t risking it. Well… you know Mrs. Robichaux? Yeah, she came over one day to drop off something to the Ol man and she sees me. Without a word, she opens this little case in her purse and offers me one of these. Says there’s a little cannabis in it, but it’s more herbs than herb.” He ashes the rollie again and takes another pull. “Took the pain away… helped the swelling… allowed me to function…all the good things. So I’ve been buying from her for years now. The Ol’ man might now but he hasn’t said anything about my California sober lifestyle. I haven’t touched pills in seven years… I don’t drink… just this. Twice a day, as prescribed by Mrs. Robichaux.”

I raise my mug to him before finishing my coffee. He passes it off, and puts our mugs in the sink before tootling off down the hall without a word. A few moments pass before I hear the shower kick on.

I finish the last little bit of the joint before heading to the living room to wait.

My dear reader, at this moment I realized I couldn’t go with him to the hardware store unless he took me home first. I’m still in my pajamas. I can’t wear Blinky the fish boxers and a hole filled t-shirt to the hardware. My robe doesn’t pass for anything close to trench coat like.  I didn’t even have shoes. When I ran out of the house, I just grabbed Demeter and her carrier.

Ian however, was cool about letting me stay here while he ran errands if I’d feed Bruno for him when he got up. A fair deal right? I think that’s him pulling in now. I’ve gotta get De back in her carrier before we can leave.
