Hello, my name is Alice. A week ago I found my close friend dead in his apartment, these stories are from a notebook he left to me. As far as i know henry was never one for lying and after asking around to the best of my abilities this story is true. I leave it to you dear reader to decide what you think about Henry's story.

My name is Henry at 15 i tried killing myself. I know you're wondering why the trauma dump but I promise this is important. Anyways since that day most people have told me that i always felt off. Something about how I look or talk, I don't know how to explain it but people got sad around me. It never really made sense to me until today.

See i was going to visit my younger brother in the ICU he had an inflammation in his pancreas and had to get it removed. As I entered the ICU i could feel people starring at me for some reason only a few 6 or 7 but it was enough to get that feeling you know? The feeling where people are staring daggers at you and you can't help but feel it.

Then it started all at once 6 or 7 people just screaming, it was chaotic to say the least. I couldn't tell why or what made them scream but clearly it was me. I was rushed out of that room and into my brother's room. I obviously found this weird but I had more important things on my mind, so I pushed the screaming to the back of my mind assuming a bunch of crazies were at the ICU.

A few hours after making sure my brother was okay and preparing to leave the ICU a nurse pulled me aside and told me what had happened, apparently all the patients had seen a specter of death or whatever the appropriation was in their culture. It didn't make sense to the nurse he told me every single person had a different story of what they saw. 

Its now 3 am while I'm writing this. Not a single person who was screaming in that icu survived for more than 8 hours, my dad called me and told me this after there was mass panic in the hospital. 

Im honestly gonna try and get some sleep today has been long. ~H

Its been a year and a half since I opened this notebook. For a while it was like a bad dream that never happened. Thankfully my brother is okay.

For a while after writing the first time I couldn't sleep for a few days but after that I figured it was just a bunch of crazys again. But today something happened and all I can think of is that day in the ICU.

I was going down the freeway on my daily work commute I stopped at the traffic light and was changing my music when the person in the car next to me started screaming. An ear piercing blood curdling scream as if he'd seen a ghost. This naturally caused a commotion and people got out to help and see what the fuss was about. I also go out to help but the man just kept screaming at me and telling people to get away from me. He also yelled something about a shinigami???
 
I didn't know what that was but after looking it up apparently it's a god of death? Like a spirit that causes death. I'm not sure but I don't know what to do and I'm freaking out. 

I'm gonna try and get some sleep ~H

The police came to my door today, they talked to me about that man who was screaming the other day. Apparently he died a few hours after of a stroke. 

I told them what happened but I didn't mention the "shinigami". I would look like a crazy person i mean I feel like a crazy person.

What there's a god of death latched to me? I sound insane writing this out. I'm honestly just scared and confused is it an omen of death? Or does it kill people am I gonna hurt the people around me??

Looking back at these notes I remember this week henry was off, he didn't answer the phone for a while and he was jumpy all the time. I think he was a lot more scared than he was letting on
