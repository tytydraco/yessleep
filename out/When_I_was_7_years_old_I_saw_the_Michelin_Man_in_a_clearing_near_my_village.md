I'm 38 right now. But what I’m about to tell happened when I was 7 years old. I was born in Judenbach. It was a very small village in germany and still is today. As often I was playing with my friends, because there was not much todo.   
We played „catch“ in wheat fields, did fights with sticks and explored the nearby forest. At one day, it must have been in July 1992, because it was some days after my birthday, I was still out and about ... but my friends left because they were invited by another friend who did not like me. So I was still going around. I walked through a thin piece of forest behind which is a small clearing that’s like 15 Minutes from my old home. Behind is a small clearing. On the other side we had built a small "castle" out of sticks, old wood boards and stones over the summer.   
But when I was about to come out of the forest to the clearing, I saw something strange. I saw what I initially thought was a car on fire ... but it was a metal egg of some sort that appeared to be lying on its side. It had about the size of a bus. It was totally smooth and shiny and reflected the red light of the sunset making it look like it was on fire. At first it seemed to just be lying on the ground ... but not really, it was hovering maybe half a meter off the grass. I watched it for maybe three minutes but didn't dare to get closer. I heard a low hum, like a power generator, and then I heard a rustling sound.   
To the left of the wooded area sourrounding the clearing something came out of the undergrowth. It was someone or something that appeared to be wearing a thick pressure suit that was divided into thin vertical segments. And I know this might sound silly, but it looked like the Michelin man. So really exactly the same like the Michelin man, ... except for the head. There was a small dome made of glass under which a head could be seen very dimly. The thing walked towards the egg. And as it got closer I could see its back … there was some kind of small canister clamped on it that was just as shiny as the egg.   
From the forest to the egg, the thing needed maybe half a minute. Once there, it stood there, slowly spinning in a circle as if it was wanting to look at everything again ... while doing so, it was also looking in my way. But I was lying flat on the floor and it didn't seem to see me. Then it walked off to the back of the egg.   
I heard a "click click" sound. Then the buzzing got louder, I felt a like a burning in my head... and then something must have happened. 'Cause the next thing I know is that I was waking up. I felt pretty dizzy like after a way to short nap. The sun was down by now, maybe 30 minutes had passed.   
It totally confused me and I went home. I have only told one person about it so far, my grandfather, who has long since passed away.  
I'm honestly not sure if this is the right forum to post. I don't know what happened to me there. Maybe I just imagined it. But with so much talk about UFOs and aliens lately, the memory came back and I really can't sleep on some of the next ones because of it. So maybe this is the right place after all.
