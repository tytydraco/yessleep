I started working at a family-run funeral home. It was every bit a family-run business, so I was surprised when they offered me the Job. 

Mr Eddison acquired the business after his father passed it down to him when he passed away. 

Mr Eddison and his wife Debra had two sons, Patrick and Fergal and one daughter, Allison, who all played a part in the daily runnings of the business. 

Mr Eddison and his wife prepared the bodies. Mr Eddison was the embalmer, while Debra did the make-up and dressed them. Patrick and Fergal drove and looked after the funeral cars, while Allison looked after the rest. 

At first, I wasn’t sure where I would fit in. Every member of the family had some role in making sure everything ran smoothly. 

On my first day, Mr Eddison asked me to accompany him down to the Embalming room. 

When I first entered the room I was struck by a strong pickle-like odor. 

Mr Eddison was preparing a body for embalming and was mixing a concoction of chemicals. 

“That smell you're getting in Formaldeide. It took me a few years, but I have gotten the mixer just right.” 

“Right for what?”I asked.

For preserving the bodies. You see, the mixer has to be just right. Too much Formaldehyde and the body will stink of pickles. Too much methanol and the body starts to shrivel up long before it goes into the ground. Too much   Glutaraldehyde and the body turns to mush.”

I could feel my stomach churn as he drained the body of its natural fluids and replaced them with embalming fluid. 

“Do you know how long a body stays preserved for,” he asked. 

The whole process was nauseating and I wasn’t sure I wanted to know. 

“I don’t know, a few months,” I replied. 

“My method guarantees the preservation of the bodies for up to five years,” he said with a big proud smile on his face. 

I wasn’t sure why that would matter if the body was buried after 2 weeks. I just nodded in amazement. 

“You're probably wondering why I hired you.” 

He looked at me as If he wanted me to answer him, but I wasn’t sure what the right answer would be. 

“We don’t normally take in outsiders, But I needed someone impartial to keep an eye on my two boys.” 

He paused for a moment to take the tube that was pumping the fluids out of the body. 

“Partick and Fergal are unique and growing up around bodies probably wasn’t the best environment for them. I understand there are rumours about my boys circling town.”

I didn’t know much about the family and Mr Eddison was looking at me as if I knew what the local gossip was about his family. 

“If there is talk about them I haven't heard anything,” I assured him. 

Patrick and Fergal had their garage where they spent most of their time servicing the Funeral cars. 

When I first walked into the garage I was struck by how big the two of them were. They towered over me, at well over 6ft tall. Fergal had a prominent lazy eye that made him look intimidating. 

“You must be the new guy. Let's hope you last longer than the last guy,” laughed Patrick. 

“Last guy,” I thought to myself. I was surprised because I thought I was the first outsider to get a job at the funeral home. 

“What happened to the last guy?” I asked. 

Fergal stopped what he was doing and walked over to me and threw his arm over my shoulder. 

“What’s the one vehicle that never gets stopped by police?” asked Fergal. 

I wasn’t sure what to say so I just shrugged my shoulders. 

“Funeral cars! I could kill you right now and drive around all day with your body in the back and I would never be stopped.” Fergal said in an ominous tone that sent a cold chill down my spine. 

I let out a nervous laugh because I wasn’t sure how to respond to what felt like an obvious threat. 

“Leave the new guy alone, Fergal,” said a warm soothing voice that seemed to come out of nowhere. 

I turned to see where the voice was coming from. The woman standing in the doorway of the garage was surprisingly pretty and seemed normal in comparison to the rest of her family. 

“My name is Allison and you must be Phillip?” She said as she raised her hand to shake mine. 

“Don’t mind these two idiots. Their bark is louder than their bite,” she said in a reassuring tone. “Can you give me a hand with something upstairs?”

As I helped her bring the coffins in from the back and into the showroom, I couldn’t help but notice Allison had an air of confidence that radiated from her. She moved and talked with purpose and she didn’t mince her words. 

“Your dad said something about rumours concerning your brothers?”

“My Dad spends too much time with the dead, to know or understand what the living are doing or saying.” 

I could tell by her uncomfortable demeanour that this topic struck a nerve with her. 

“My brothers are misunderstood due to their job and how they look. So when the last guy that worked for us went missing people assumed it was something to do with them.”

I wasn’t prepared for what she was telling me or why I was only hearing about this now. Something was starting to feel off about this family. 

The newest body that was brought from the morgue to the funeral home was a little close to home. 

Bobby Junior was killed when his car veered off the road in a tragic accident. We weren’t the best of friends but we shared many classes when we were in school together. I had heard from my mother that the car he was in went up in flames when it hit a tree and his mother was distraught that she couldn’t have an open coffin.

I knew working in a funeral home I was going to see dead bodies, and I was ok with that. But when I was asked to retrieve something from the freezer I wasn’t expecting to find someone I knew laid out with all his injuries on display. 

It was a shocking and terrifying sight, but what was more shocking was what I found Patrick doing in there. He had the cloth covering his body pulled right back and was taking Polaroid pictures of the corpse. 

When he realized I was behind him he didn’t seem fazed and continued to take pictures. 

“What the hell, dude? That’s disrespectful and insane. Why are you taking pictures?” I firmly asked.  

“Look at him, he’s crispy. What a horrible way to go,” he said with a strange smile on his face. 

“This is messed up. You need to get out of here before I tell your father.”

He looked at me with contempt as he shook the fresh polaroid picture. 

“This one is going on the wall,” he said before walking out of the freezer and locking it behind him, trapping me inside. 

I started banging on the door. Maybe he didn’t mean to lock it,” I thought, but when no one came to let me out panic set in. 

I was acutely aware I was trapped in the freezer with the badly burnt corpse lying just a few from me. If I had any nightmare scenarios in my head this was up there with the worst of them. 

I screamed and banged on the door until my hands began to bleed. I had never felt fear like it. I knew I was overreacting, but I couldn’t escape the feeling Bobby was going to get up from the cold metal slab and start crawling towards me.

The door suddenly opened after being in there for hours. The woman who opened the door  was dressed in a strange 1950s 1950s-style dress, which made her look older than she was. 

“You must be the new guy?” She asked as I fell into her arms exhausted. 

“My poor boy, you're freezing. How did you manage to get yourself locked in the freezer?” 

There was something warm and motherly about her. Maybe it was because she was dressed like someone you’d find from one of those old Mennonite communities, or it was her soothing voice, I just felt at ease.  

“You must be Debra?”

“You can call me Debbie, young man,” she said as she flashed me a warm gentle smile.

I tried putting what happened behind me and put it down to a silly accident. Today was Bobby’s funeral and his family was about to arrive at the funeral home. 

Allison asked me to roll his coffin into the chapel and have it opened for when the family got here. I was surprised at her request because I was sure it was a closed coffin. 

When I brought the coffin into the chapel and opened the lid. I was astonished to find Bobby’s face looking perfect. It looked so well you might have thought he was just sleeping. I had spent hours locked in a cold fridge with him so I knew how badly burnt he was. What I was now looking at was nothing short of a miracle.  

Something didn’t feel right about what I was seeing, but when I saw how happy Bobby’s mother was when she got to kiss her son and say her final goodbyes I put it to the back of my mind. 

After the funeral, Allison was nowhere to be seen so I decided to go ask Mr Eddison about Bobby’s miraculous appearance. 

There was an eerie silence as I made my way down the hall to the embalming room. As I neared the room I was once again assaulted by the smell of pickles.

I knocked on the door but got no answer. 

“Maybe he’s out,” I thought as I tried the handle. 

I poked my head in the door and slowly looked around the empty room. I was just about to turn back when something caught my eye. 

An awful feeling of dread washed over me as soon as I saw Allison lying motionless on a cold metal slab. 

She was pale as a ghost and she didn’t look like she was alive. My hands trembled as I checked for a pulse. Panic set in as Allison was clearly dead. 

 When I heard footsteps coming down the corridor I frantically searched around the room for somewhere to hide. The only place big enough was another freezer. I was still traumatized from my last experience in a freezer, but I bit the bullet and hid in it. 

There was a glass panel on the door of the freezer that allowed me to see Mr Eddison and his Wife, Debra, enter the room. They seemed to be smiling and Joking with each other and not upset by the fact their daughter was dead and laid out on a cold slab. 

Mr Eddison took a large Jar of strange-looking liquid from one of the shelves and placed it next to Allison. He poured the liquid into a centrifugal pump he used for embalming the bodies before inserting a tube into Allison's arterial vein in her neck and began pumping the strange blue liquid into her body. 

I felt like all the air was sucked from the room as I tried to catch my breath. I didn’t want to believe what I saw next, but Allison slowly started to move before sitting up seemingly alive. 

No one in the room seemed fazed by the sudden miraculous event, and if I didn’t know any better, it seemed like a normal occurrence. 

My head was in a spin as I tried to make sense of what I saw. I was too scared and bewildered to notice all the dead bodies in the room with me.

 There were hundreds of bodies stacked wall to wall, but one stood out more than the rest. It was Bobby’s badly burnt body. 

But if his body was here, whose body was upstairs in the chapel?
