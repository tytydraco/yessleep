**“You trust me, don’t you?”**

 

I looked up from the baby, tension tightening my neck and spine like a coiled spring.  “Of course I do.”

 

**“Trust that I’m always going to look out for you, no matter what?”**

 

Nodding, I let out a sigh.  “Sure, I mean yeah, I trust that.”

 

**“But you’re worried the baby isn’t yours.”**

 

I flinched slightly.  “If I’m being honest, the thought has crossed my mind.”

 

**“Okay.**  ***Why*** **has it crossed your mind?”**

 

The baby was still asleep, and I wanted to keep it that way.  Keeping my voice low and even, I went on.  “Because there was that time that I was away at the hospital.  It was only for six weeks, and yeah, we started…you know, being intimate a few days after I got back.  But she wasn’t born late or anything.  And the time frame…well, a lot of it was when I was still in the hospital.”

 

**“But not all of it.”**

 

“No, not…”

 

**“What else then?”**

 

“What?”

 

**“Well, I mean if you’re going to accuse your wife, the mother of your child, of cheating on you, of pawning a little bastard off on you, don’t you think you should have more evidence?”**

 

“Well, yeah, I mean…”

 

**“Then what is it?”**

 

I almost said nothing else.  Not because I was angry or didn’t know, but because it hurt to say.  “It’s the looks I get.  Some of them are just bored or irritated, and I get that, sure.  Fine.  But some of them…they’re questioning, you know?  Like I’m being evaluated.  Am I crazy?  Dangerous?

 

**“And yet you’re trusted to take care of the baby.  Some dangerous lunatic left with an infant regularly.”** 

 

“Well, if not that, questioning if I going to have another breakdown?  Become a burden?  Like maybe it’s time to look for someone new and better.”

 

**“Okay.  I can tell you’re serious about this, and I get why you might feel that way.  Anything else that’s worrying you or making you worry that Chelsea isn’t your baby?”**

 

I stared down at her.  She was a good baby overall.  And I didn’t mind taking care of her.  I loved her.  Truth be told, having someone that I could take care of made me feel better about myself.  Like I was more normal, more needed.  But at the same time…

 

“There’s that Terry guy at work.  Always texting late at night and on the weekends, and I try to not act jealous, but I was already noticing a weirdness before my breakdown, and ever since I got back from the hospital, and especially since the baby came…I can just tell that something is going on.”

 

**“Fuck.  Okay, listen.  And I need you to really listen and not freak out.  What I’m about to tell you…it’s going to be really hard to hear.  I’ve wanted to be honest with you for a long time, but I didn’t think you were ready.”**

 

I felt my heart speeding up with every word and I had to fight not nervously jangle my knees up and down, which would wake up Chelsea.  “Oh…um…God.   Okay.  Just tell me the truth and we’ll f…

 

My phone buzzed on the bench next to me.

 

*“Hey Hun.”*

 

I swallowed nervously.  “Hey, babe.  How’s work going today?”

 

*“It’s fine.  Just had a few minutes before the afternoon staffing and I thought I’d check on you and the baby.”*

 

Trying to keep my voice even, I gave a little laugh.  “Oh yeah.  She’s been real good.  Took her bottle earlier, and she’s asleep on my lap now.”

 

*“Oh?  That’s good.  Did ya’ll go out?  I saw the door sensor went off about an hour ago, and I wasn’t sure if ya’ll went out or not.”*

 

I felt my stomach twist a little.  “Yeah, yeah.  I decided to get her some fresh air.  Should be done soon though.”

 

*“Okay…well, remember to keep her out of the sun.  And I’ll be home a little late tonight, but I’ll bring dinner when I come.”*

 

“Sounds good.  Love you.”

 

*“You too. Bye.”*

 

Hanging up the phone, I stuffed it in my pocket and then gently stood up, cradling Chelsea as gently as I could.  “Okay.  Go ahead and tell me.”

 

**“You’ve been right the whole time.  It’s not your baby.  You know it, and I know it.  I can see more than you, but you’re a smart guy.  A perceptive guy.  And you deserve better than that cheating whore and her little bastard.”**

 

Clenching my jaw, I nodded, walking up to the edge of the railing.  I glanced around.  No people still, and no cameras either.  One of the tallest buildings in town, but also old and out-of-date.  Just warning signs and railings, nothing else.

 

“Then what should I do?”

 

**“You trust me, don’t you?”**

 

I felt tears begin crawling down my cheeks.  “You know that I do.”

 

**“Then twist that thing’s neck and throw it over the**[ side.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/)**”**
