The Nova coughed to life after the third try. I let it idle for a bit, the heater wheezing and blowing cold air at my knees. My hands still felt stiff from the cold, and my back ached in a way that made me realize how long eight hours can feel when you’re alone and watching nothing happen.

I didn’t want to go straight home.

There was a Burger King two blocks down from the asylum. It sat at the edge of a busted-up shopping plaza where the only other open business was a check-cashing place with bars on the windows. I parked in front, peeled off my uniform jacket, and went inside.

The place smelled like hot grease and burnt coffee. The booths were hard plastic and stained. Two old guys sat near the window, not talking, just slowly eating like it was the only thing on their calendar today. The counter girl didn’t even look up when I walked in.

I ordered black coffee and two sausage croissan’wiches. Ate one at the table, slowly, like I was trying to taste something besides salt and fatigue. The second one sat in the greasy paper bag until I crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash on my way out.

After breakfast, I still didn’t feel like going home.

I don’t know if it was the thought of walking back into that cold little studio apartment, or just the leftover nerves from the night shift clinging to my skin like sweat. Either way, I needed to be somewhere with people. Somewhere with light. Somewhere that didn’t feel like it was slowly rotting from the inside out.

So I drove to **Kmart.**

It was one of the big ones, still open over on West 117th, across from the old pizza buffet that used to smell like melted rubber bands. The kind of Kmart that had that permanent dim lighting, floors so waxed they looked wet, and a weird, almost chemical smell in every aisle — like plastic and mildew and something vaguely citrus that couldn’t quite cover up the age of the place.

I wasn’t looking for anything in particular.

Just wandering.

But then I found myself in the automotive section, standing in front of the car stereos.

Mine had been broken for months. It only picked up static and the occasional religious broadcast from somewhere in Kentucky. I kept telling myself I’d replace it once I had a steady paycheck — and now, technically, I did. Barely.

The Jensen stereo caught my eye. Nothing fancy, not the cool one with the detachable faceplate and blue backlight — just the next model down. Black plastic. Chrome buttons. It had a cassette deck and a digital tuner. That was enough for me.

I bought it without even checking the price tag.

The cashier barely looked at me as I paid. Some teenager with chapped knuckles and a name tag that said “Jimmy S.” I think I said thanks. I don’t remember if he answered.

Outside, the sun was up and bright, but it didn’t feel warm. Just overexposed.

I jumped in the car, tossed the stereo behind the seat, and finally drove home.

My apartment was exactly as I left it. Still smelled faintly of old carpet and burnt microwave popcorn. I stripped out of the uniform and dropped it on the back of the only chair I owned. Set my boots by the radiator and stood there for a moment, just listening.

It was too quiet.

I laid down on the mattress, still dressed down to my undershirt, and pulled the blanket up to my chin. My body hurt in places I didn’t know could hurt. My eyes felt grainy, like they were full of ash.

I didn’t dream. At least, not that I remembered.

I woke up sometime after nine.

The light leaking through the blinds was that watery, fading kind of gold that meant the sun was already packing it in. My mouth tasted like stale coffee and grease. My back cracked when I stood up. I showered fast — the water never got fully hot — then pulled my uniform back on, still creased from where I left it.

The Nova fired up on the first try this time, which I took as a good omen, even if the muffler still rattled like it was held on with wire and a prayer.

The drive back to the Cleveland Developmental Center was uneventful, but the sky was starting to dim again. Long shadows stretched across the cracked pavement. The world looked softer and stranger at that hour — not quite night, not quite day. In-between. Like the place itself.

As I turned into the main drive, the buildings came into view again — those little abandoned cottages huddled around the old asylum like satellites orbiting a dead star.

And for the first time, I realized I didn’t want to be here.

Not just because of the cold. Not because I was tired.  
Because something felt wrong.

But I was twenty-four, broke, and too stubborn to admit I was scared.

I pulled into the lot around 10:45 p.m., same as the night before. The headlights swept across the empty blacktop and bounced off the squat brick cottages like a searchlight on a battlefield. Everything looked the same, but somehow worse. Like it had been sitting there thinking about me all day.

I killed the engine and sat for a second, listening to it tick as it cooled.

The wind had picked up. It funneled through the narrow spaces between the buildings and made the security office door rattle faintly in its frame.

Inside, the air was stuffy and still held the faint, sour smell of the heater. The monitors were already on, glowing in their little wire cage. One of them showed the south cottage; another rotated through the main corridor of the administration building. All static and silence. Nothing moved. Nothing ever moved — except when it did.

I hung my jacket on the back of the folding chair, set my flashlight on the desk, and started my first set of rounds.

The cold bit deeper than the night before. The kind of cold that didn’t just touch your skin but tried to burrow in. The kind that made your breath feel damp and sharp in your throat.

The cottages were arranged in a horseshoe, maybe fifty yards apart, their windows mostly boarded or caked with grime. I moved from one to the next with my collar turned up and my boots crunching across gravel and frost.

I signed each log in quick, cramped handwriting and moved on fast, never staying longer than I had to. The dark corners of those rooms always felt like they were waiting for something.

By the time I’d finished the sixth cottage, my gloves were stiff again, and my flashlight battery was already dimming. I made a mental note to hit the drugstore tomorrow.

Back at the office, I locked the door behind me and sat down in front of the monitors. The office chair squeaked under me, loud in the silence. I turned the space heater up to full and warmed my hands in front of it, knuckles red from the cold.

The rest of the night moved slow.

There’s a strange heaviness to that kind of quiet — the kind that starts to press in on you after a few hours. I tried to stay busy. Doodled on the back of a boiler log sheet. Watched the monitors like they were going to surprise me.

Nothing.

A flicker of static here, a hallway light buzzing faintly there. That was it.

It was just before daybreak — maybe 5:45 a.m. — and I was making my final heater checks, flashlight in one hand, half-eaten apple in the other. I’d stopped checking the building numbers. My focus was gone, everything smeared together in that early-morning fog when your brain feels like it’s floating a few feet behind your body.

I stepped into one of the cottages — one closer to the center, closer to the asylum. As soon as I crossed the threshold, I felt it. Heavier air. Damper. Like the place was sealed tighter than the rest.

I was halfway through the living room, shining the flashlight toward a wall covered in peeling floral wallpaper, when I heard it:

Children. Laughing.

Not right outside. Not in the distance. Inside the cottage. Above me.

Light, fluttery giggles. Two voices — maybe three. Boys or girls, I couldn’t tell. The kind of laughter kids make when they’re doing something they know they’re not supposed to.

My first thought wasn’t ghosts or anything supernatural. It was: What the hell are kids doing in here?  
I assumed some neighborhood kids had snuck in during the day and fallen asleep. Or were hiding. Maybe even messing with me.

I started toward the hallway, fast and low, like I was about to storm the palace.

And then I stopped.

Because it hit me, suddenly and horribly: There was no upstairs.

None of the cottages had a second floor. No stairs. No attic. Just a single level. Every single unit was built flat, one story, all on concrete slabs. Nothing above but insulation, ceiling panels, and a roof.

But the laughing — was still coming from above me. Moving. Like little feet running across a bedroom I knew wasn’t there.

My chest tightened. All the hair on my neck stood up like someone had jammed a live wire down my shirt.

I didn’t run, exactly. But I moved fast.

I backed out of the hallway and made a B-line for the door, heart hammering in my throat. I didn’t look back. I didn’t shine my light anywhere else. My only thought was get out get out get out.

I pulled the front door open—

And froze.

There were dogs.

Six, maybe seven of them, in a loose semicircle right outside the steps. Big, rangy mutts — not the friendly kind. All ribs and yellow eyes, tails stiff and ears pinned back. One of them had a torn ear. Another had something shiny around its neck, like a bit of chain or wire.

They weren’t barking. Just growling, low and mean, lips peeled back to show long yellow teeth. The kind of dogs that looked born mean, like they grew up eating bones and broken glass.

But I wasn’t scared.

Because I had my .38 on me.

I kept it loaded — five hollow points in the cylinder and one blank, just in case. Habit from my dad, who said if you ever had to draw a gun, you’d better be ready to fire it. But sometimes all it takes is the *sight* of the thing.

So I stepped forward, slow, and drew it from my holster — not aiming, just letting them see the shape of it, the glint of the barrel.

The change was instant.

The growling stopped. Every dog flinched. One even yelped.

Then they bolted.

All at once, scattering like roaches, tails between their legs, claws scrabbling on the cracked pavement. They didn’t bark. Didn’t look back. They just vanished into the fog curling at the edge of the lot.

I stood there for a few long seconds, panting, gun still raised.

Then I shoved it back in my holster and walked fast — real fast — across the lot toward the admin building to drop off the morning paper.

I needed to see another human being.

The administration building was one of the only ones still partially in use — city employees came during the day to sort old medical files and patient logs. The building itself looked like a bloated DMV. Metal handrails that wobbled when you grabbed them. A glass entrance vestibule where a potted plant had died so long ago that someone just left it there, in a layer of dust.

But inside?

Warm. Normal. Safe.

I stepped in, half-expecting another ghostly laugh — but no. Just the soft hum of heat through the vents, the buzz of overhead fluorescents, and the sharp chemical smell of cheap lemon-scented floor cleaner.

She was already there, behind the front desk, sorting files into a grey cabinet that looked like it hadn’t closed properly since 1974.

I didn’t know her name yet, but I’d seen her the first day — briefly.

Business casual — wool skirt, thick tights, flat shoes. A cardigan with a broken button. She had the vibe of someone who taught Sunday school for forty years and would still hit you with a ruler if you didn’t address her as *ma’am.*

When I walked in, she glanced up and gave a curt nod.

“You’re back.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just, uh... dropping off the paper.”

She took them without looking at me and placed them neatly on a metal tray next to the coffee pot.

Then she looked at me again. More closely this time.

“You look pale,” she said.

“I had a weird night.”

She raised one eyebrow. “You work here long enough, they’re all weird.”

I wasn’t planning to say anything.

I must’ve looked pale, because her eyes narrowed behind her thick glasses and she said again, “You alright?”

“I…” I paused. “No.”

She didn’t say anything. Just kept staring at me with that teacher-patient expression, like she’d seen the same look in other people before.

I rubbed the back of my neck. The skin there still felt tight and cold.

“I was in one of the cottages — near the asylum — and I heard kids laughing,” I said. “It was above me. Upstairs. But…”

“But there is no upstairs,” she finished.

I looked at her.

She didn’t look surprised.

“And when I left,” I continued, “there were dogs. A whole pack. Like they were waiting for me. But the second I pulled my revolver, they scattered. Like they *knew* what it was.”

I trailed off, embarrassed by how wild it all sounded now that I’d said it out loud. But she just nodded, slow, and reached for the coffee pot.

She poured herself a cup — no cream, no sugar — and sipped it like she had all the time in the world.

“You ever hear of a girl named Eleanor Brooks?” she asked, without looking at me.

I shook my head.

“She was a patient here. Nineteen, I think. Came in around ’43 or ’44. Schizophrenia, maybe. Depression. They used a lot of broad terms back then — anything to get someone institutionalized.”

Her voice was low and even. Like she was reciting a bedtime story she’d told too many times.

“They said Eleanor liked to walk. Would just wander the halls for hours, day or night. Never spoke. Never looked at anyone. Just drifted from room to room like she was sleepwalking. She'd make these humming sounds, almost like a lullaby.”

I didn’t say anything. My throat was tight.

“One night, she wandered into the tunnels during a storm. Back when they still used them to transfer patients between buildings. She got turned around. Didn’t come back.”

She took another sip.

“They didn’t find her for two days.”

My mouth went dry. “Where was she?”

“East tunnel,” she said. “Near the old maintenance access. Concrete floor down there gets slick when it floods. They found her curled up in a corner like she’d just… fallen asleep. But the cold got her.”

“Wow.”

“Thing is,” she continued, “her body left a stain. On the floor. You wouldn’t think that happens, but it does. Blood and oil and… other things. Sank into the concrete. They’ve painted over it. Stripped it. Scrubbed it with bleach, even tried to seal it with epoxy.”

She leaned in a little, voice dropping to a whisper like it wasn’t something she should be saying aloud.

“But it always comes back. Same shape. Same color. Just this dark, wet-looking outline, like she’s *still there.*”

I looked down at my boots.

“People say she still walks,” the woman said. “Still wanders. Same way she did in life. Only now, she doesn’t make a sound.”

I looked back up at her.

She was watching me with that same calm expression — not scared, not dramatic, just… matter-of-fact.

“I saw her once,” she added.

My mouth went dry. “Where?”

“Down by the old file annex. That’s the hallway behind the tunnel stairwell, east wing.” She said it like a grocery list, as if that wasn’t the most terrifying sentence in the world. “I was sorting old intake records. Thought someone was behind me. Turned around, and there she was.”

“What did she look like?”

She didn’t answer right away.

Finally, she said, “Ghostly.”

That was all.

Then she stood, dusted off her skirt, and grabbed the metal tray with the newspaper.

“I don’t like staying here past seven,” she said, walking toward the back hall. “Too many stories. And stories, you’ll learn, have a way of following you around here.”

I didn’t say another word.

I just stood there for a minute after she left. Listening to the silence she left behind.

Then I walked out the way I came. The sky was starting to go soft with morning — that strange lavender-blue you only get for about ten minutes. I pulled my coat tighter, climbed into the Nova, and started the engine.

I didn’t go straight home that morning.

Couldn’t.

Even though I was running on fumes, my head was buzzing with too much weird static to lay down. That kind of jittery, greasy feeling you get after too much bad coffee and no sleep — where every sound feels too loud and your body’s tired but your brain just keeps chewing the same thought over and over.

**Eleanor Brooks.**

I couldn’t get her out of my head. Not the name, but the story.

So instead of collapsing face-first onto my mattress, I drove straight to the Burger King off Harvard — same one I’d hit the night before. I slid into the back booth, the one by the window that looked out toward the street. The blinds were halfway bent and one was broken completely, letting a harsh beam of early sun stab right through and catch me in the face.

I didn’t bother with food. Just got a large black coffee and sat there with my back to the wall, jacket still zipped.

The place was nearly empty. A woman with a screaming toddler. Two older guys in flannel coats having a raspy conversation about spark plugs. The fryers hissed now and then, but otherwise it was just that buzzing fluorescents-and-formica quiet that fast food places get during the dead hours between breakfast and lunch.

I nursed the coffee until my hands stopped shaking.

I figured the library didn’t open until nine, maybe nine-thirty, so I killed time doodling on a napkin with a busted pen I found in my coat. I wrote her name a few times — *Eleanor Brooks* — then circled it. Underlined it. As if that would unlock something. All I knew was that I needed to know more. Needed something to anchor the feeling I had — that what I’d seen, or heard, wasn’t just in my head.

I finished the coffee, then another. It didn’t help.

At 9:02, I drove to the Cleveland Public Library on Lorain.

It was already busy — school groups and retirees drifting through the tall stone lobby with its carved ceilings and that faint smell of paper, dust, and floor wax. I checked my coat, headed upstairs to the archives.

This was 1987 — so no internet. No digital search. No easy way to type in *“Eleanor Brooks ghost Cleveland asylum”* and get a thousand hits.

Just a wall of faded wooden card catalogs. Drawers packed tight with yellowed index cards, filed by hand in cursive and clunky typewriter font. I stood there flipping cards for nearly an hour. *Brooks, E.* *Brooks, Eleanor.* *Brooks, Elaine.* Nothing.

Finally, I found a few microfilm reels of old *Plain Dealer* and *Cleveland Press* issues from the 1940s. I squinted into one of those ancient film readers, scrolling through endless sheets of tiny print, my eyes burning.

There were a few mentions of Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum — mostly reports of overcrowding, funding issues, occasional scandals. A doctor accused of misconduct. A breakout in ’42. Nothing about a missing girl. Nothing about a body in the tunnels.

It was like Eleanor Brooks never existed.

Eventually, I found a brief column — maybe 80 words, buried on page 14 of a 1944 issue — about an unnamed patient “found deceased in the service tunnels following a two-day search.” No photo. No follow-up.

That was it.

They didn’t even give her a name.

It made something twist in my stomach.

I stayed until the librarian politely told me they were closing the archives room for a school tour. I left empty-handed, frustrated, and more unsettled than when I walked in.

If anything, it all felt *worse* now. The fact that no one remembered her — that she had no history — made the whole thing feel colder. Like the place itself had swallowed her up.

Like it wanted her forgotten.

I went home, finally, but only for a couple of hours. I didn’t sleep. Just lay there on top of the covers in the dim afternoon light, boots still on, jacket still zipped. I stared at the ceiling and tried not to think about that laughter.

That stain.

When the sun dipped behind the rooftops, I got up, brushed my teeth, changed into my uniform.

I drove to work with the heater blasting and the radio off.

The asylum was already in silhouette by the time I pulled up — tall and black and jagged against a fading purple sky.

Same parking spot.

Same flickering overhead light.

Only difference?

This time, I didn’t feel alone.

I pulled into the lot and sat in the Nova for a long minute, engine idling, eyes locked on the asylum’s shadow across the field. The sun was gone, but a trace of reddish-purple still smeared the edges of the sky. The building looked darker than the night around it — like it was swallowing the last bit of light.

I opened the glove box, stared at the revolver, then grabbed it and slid it into the holster without thinking. The feel of the cold metal calmed me in a way I hated.

I walked across the gravel to the security office. The wind bit harder than it had the last two nights. My ears stung, and my breath came out in thick white bursts that hung too long in the air.

Inside, the heat was already on.

I shut the door behind me and locked it.

My plan was simple: Get it over with. No poking around. No exploring. No more trying to be a ghost detective.

Just check the heaters. Sign the logs. Go home in one piece.

Only… I didn’t do that.

Each cottage had a little binder hung by the front door — wire hook, plastic sleeve, single sheet for each month. A line for every date. Just a space to initial and confirm the boiler was working. I didn’t think twice about it the first night. But now, after what happened…

I decided I wasn’t going back in.

Not all the way, anyway.

I did a quick lap of the outer ring, moving fast. Cold seeping into my shoes. Every shadow looked like it was breathing. Every porch creaked under my boots like it was trying to warn me. I kept one hand in my coat pocket and the other on the grip of the .38.

I’d reach the porch, step inside *just enough* to grab the log sheet, and sign my initials with a frozen Bic pen I kept behind my ear. Sometimes I couldn’t even see the heater from where I stood.

Didn’t matter.

I wasn’t going deeper.

By the fifth cottage, my heart was racing. Not from fear exactly, but from *pretending* I wasn’t afraid.

When I got back to the shack, my hands were trembling. I could barely get the key back in the lock. Once I was inside, I shoved the door shut and turned both deadbolts, top and bottom. Then I dropped into the dented metal chair by the space heater and crouched close, letting the warmth wash over my face like sunlight.

I cowered there for a while. No other word for it.

Just sat there, knees bent, coat still zipped to my chin, hands out to the little orange heater glow like a freezing kid lost in the woods. I didn’t move. I didn’t check the monitors. I didn’t even take my boots off.

I just stared at the wall and tried not to think about that laugh from the night before. Or the dogs. Or the stain.

I don’t know how long I sat like that. Maybe an hour. Maybe longer.

Then something flickered at the edge of my vision.

A faint, subtle movement — not on the monitors. Out the window.

I froze.

Didn’t breathe. Just stared straight ahead, like if I turned my head too fast it might vanish.

But it didn’t.

It stayed there.

I slowly leaned toward the glass, one hand gripping the edge of the desk like I needed to anchor myself to something real.

She was standing about thirty feet away, just at the edge of the floodlight’s reach, out in front of the administration building. Right in the dead center of the cracked concrete walkway. Perfectly still. Like a statue someone had placed there while I wasn’t looking.

No coat. No shoes. Just a thin, pale dress that looked too white against the dark — the kind of white that reflects light in a way fabric shouldn’t. Her hair hung damp and stringy around her face, and her arms were down at her sides like she didn’t remember how to move them.

She was barefoot.

Barefoot in twenty-degree weather.

I blinked. Swallowed. Leaned closer to the window.

I couldn’t make out her face. It was too far — too shadowed — but the shape of her felt wrong. Not dramatic. Just… wrong. Like she wasn’t quite the right height for her body. Or her neck didn’t turn all the way like it should. Or maybe it was the way her head was tilted slightly to the side — too far, too casual, like her bones were bending the wrong way and no one had told her yet.

She wasn’t looking at anything in particular. Not the window. Not the building. Just… standing there. Staring off to the left.

I stayed completely still.

My breath fogged the glass.

Then, without warning, she moved.

Not walked — turned. Slowly. Awkwardly. Like someone spinning on a lazy Susan. Her bare feet didn’t shuffle; they pivoted. And she turned to face the building.

Not mine.

The admin building.

She started walking toward it, her pace slow and light, almost like her feet weren’t touching the ground.

My mouth was dry. I stood up without realizing I had, backing away from the window like it might snap open and suck me out through the glass.

I glanced at the monitors.

Nothing.

The cameras were still rolling — grainy footage of the hallway, stairwell and breakroom. All empty. All normal.

I looked back out the window.

She was gone.

Just — gone.

No sound. No door creaking open. No footsteps on the gravel or sidewalk. The courtyard was still. Silent. Exactly the way it had been all night.

Except now there was no one standing there.

I stared for another full minute, heart pounding, trying to breathe slowly through my nose. I wanted to tell myself it was someone messing with me. A squatter. A prank. A hallucination brought on by too much caffeine and not enough sleep.

But I hadn’t blinked.

I know what I saw.

And I knew — deep down — that I’d seen Eleanor Brooks.

Not in person.

But something had changed in me.

I wasn’t curious anymore. I wasn’t skeptical. I wasn’t trying to explain anything away with logic or fatigue or stress.

No.

I was done.

Absolutely fking done with Cleveland Developmental Center.
