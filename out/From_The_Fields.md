If you’re reading this it means I lived long enough to click post, but probably not much longer. I’ll start from the beginning. 

About a month ago I was coming back from a friends house after a night of partying and along my drive I decided to pull off into the field to piss. Now where I live its not acceptable to drink and drive. But its a lot safer than the city. My feet shakily met the soft earth and i looked at my surroundings. The field was this tall barley crop that was about four foot tall. I looked out into the tall grass as I finished and saw the strangest deer i’ve ever seen. This deer was insane, It towered over the barley like it was nothing. This deer was the size of a moose, and the antlers were gigantic. Ive seen my fair share of 10 point bucks but this must have been a 500 point buck. His head adorned in this massive crown of antlers, but they looked sick and malformed. The antlers were dark and twisted together unnaturally and had dozens for points facing every direction. The pale moonlight shone through the crown of bone, And it was gone. I figured it must have ducked down below the barley. I cursed myself for not having my gun in my truck and gave up on the potential prey. As i was driving off i nearly wrecked my truck, The deer was up the road a bit just on the edge of the field, luminous eyes reflecting my high-beams. This isn’t what caused me to crash though, It reared up on its hind legs and stood almost vertical. It must have been 16 foot tall like this and it just stood there staring at me as i drove past, but when i checked the rearview it was out of sight again. 

The next day I told all my friends about this and they gave me the usual shit, I was drunk , I’m bullshitting , I just had a weird dream when i blacked out. Thats fine I know what I saw anyways. On the way home from another wasted day I traveled past the field again, sober this time I promise, lo and behold the buck again suddenly rising from the barley. In the waning sunlight I could see him better. His antlers were dark almost charred in appearance, His back was hunched unnaturally as he stood in that hunched bipedal stance, His fur was a splotchy brown on black pattern, and his lips were pulled back in what could have been a smile with two rows of large crooked white teeth. His eyes were wide and unyielding as they stared. The overall appearance of the deer reminded me of that wasting disease they find sometimes or some kind of birth defect or developmental issues. my eyes flicked back to the road out of habit and again the buck was gone.

The third day I was driving home from work past the field again and although I
I couldn’t see it at first when I glanced in my rearview there he was, at the very edge of the field. This trend continued for a while where he wouldn’t be there, i’d look around, then he’d be there, only to disappear moments after. 

I noticed about a week in he was completely past the fields. I would see him in the middle of the road, it was as if he was moving one large step at a time. Heres where my current situation comes into play: two nights ago I caught a glimpse of it outside my house at the edge of the property. Every time I’d see him again he’d be closer. A few hours ago i saw him in the kitchen, A few feet from me. Staring at me with his gigantic head craned down so he could stand inside. 

I Locked myself in my room and panicked. I knew he was getting too close. in my panic I foolishly spun around and there he was, inches from my face. I knew I couldn’t look away or he’d be gone again and then he would reach me. I picked up a small hand mirror and slowly walked around to my desk and began writing this. Receiving a notification I foolishly looked away. He’s gone but as long as I dont look away from the screen he cant appear again. 

I made the mistake of looking past my monitor into my reflection, only to see those familiar eyes behind me. I feel a heavy ice cold cloven hoof pressing onto my shoulder. I feel shallow breaths push between crooked teeth on the back of my neck. I can FEEL those turgid lips in that unnatural smile. If you ever see something unnatural, or something you know you shouldn’t have : 

DONT LOOK,  
and if you must look 

NEVER LOOK AWAY .
