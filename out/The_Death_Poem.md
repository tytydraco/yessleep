I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this. I’m not sure if there even is one. But I need some advice or just to know if anyone else has encountered this. At the very least I feel like I need to share what I’ve discovered. What do you do with a poem that leads to the death of anyone who reads it?  
  
My father passed a few months ago, despite the gruesome nature it was eventually ruled a suicide. Still, it was bizarrely gruesome and at the time still struck me as strange. As harsh as it is there are far easier ways to end one’s own life.  
  
He was a translator, he specialized in ancient languages. To be honest I still don’t entirely understand his job. Anyway, Mum and I found him, called the police and all that. We didn't really know what to do.  
  
I won’t get into all the personal details, that’s not what this is about and it’s probably best I’m not connected to this.  
  
When we got his belongings back, it included a folded-up piece of paper. Considering everything I didn’t bother looking at it. Recently though I found out a detective and a medical examiner died shortly after. One threw himself off a bridge, the other into traffic.  
  
Weeks went by, the whole family trying to move on and mourn. I didn’t even think about the paper, not until Grandmother’s at-home nurse found it.  
  
I can only imagine how long death would have followed us if I hadn't witnessed it. I was helping look for my Grandmother’s medication. Alice, the nurse, found the note in a drawer. I watched her read it. Nothing happened. She put it back and excused herself for a moment. I figured she was going to the bathroom or something.  
  
She was but I didn’t think it was strange until we heard her collapse from blood loss. There’s no good way to describe what she painted in her own blood. I try not to remember too much, it piques my curiosity. I can only imagine what she read to inspire such… art.  
  
Suffice it to say her death sent everything spiralling into uncertainty as before. It was even stranger than my father’s death and I had watched her read it. After replaying everything a million times in my mind it didn't take long for me to fish out the paper.  
  
I don’t even know if it’s actually a poem but the text is short. I’ve done what I can to analyze it without reading but I don’t dare glance too long. It’s two paragraphs, five lines each.  
  
After everything, I became somewhat unstable. I couldn't sleep and barely ate. I wanted answers. Eventually, I worked up the courage for a small peak. I know the first word of the four first lines. I can never forget them as mundane as they are.  
  
Along.  
  
Strange.  
  
Songs.  
  
Song.  
  
They repeat in my head day and night playing over and over. The temptation to read more only builds. Even now the paper stands folded on my desk, whatever secret it holds still beyond my reach. I haven’t worked up the courage to glance again.  
  
Scouring the internet has been no help. All I can find is some old British comedy sketch about a joke so funny people die from hearing it and a Japanese cartoon about a death notebook. I’ve yet to find answers and it’s driving me mad.  
  
I can’t bring myself to burn it, I struggle not to peek despite my fear. Either it’s so wretched that one cannot live with the information within or so beautiful that one does not want to.  
  
I can feel it calling me. I want to know. It’s strange to know how you’re going to die. I don’t know when but one day I will have no choice but to read it.   
  
Until then this is my second last resort. Perhaps someone can shed some light on whatever lies within that page and save me from my own curiosity. I’ve always been a cat person, I am confident the saying applies to me.
