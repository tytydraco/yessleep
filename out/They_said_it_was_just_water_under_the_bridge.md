I just can’t seem to mind my own damn business, for as long as I can remember. Mr. social butterfly, always looking to make friends. Looking to liven up every room I walk in. Oh, what I would give to have been the quiet kid in the back of the room. The kid who never raised his hand, the kid who went straight home after school. The kid who always kept to himself and grew up to be the guy who never goes to social gatherings. But that’s just never been who I am.

Now I wouldn’t call my town small, but it’s painstakingly average. In every way a town can be average. Traffic is never too backed up, rent’s not too high, crime’s not exactly a problem. I’ve always liked living here. How many people are lucky enough to grow up in the place they want to stay forever? Okay, that’s sarcasm, I’m well aware of the amount of people who never branch out and end up always standing still. I don’t see a problem with that. I don’t think I’m one of those, though. I’d move if the right opportunity came along.

I got a pretty decent gig straight out of high school working at FedEx. Pays damn good for the area and I get to drive around all day long, which I love. I’m always the guy who drives when anyone wants to go places. Something about it just relaxes me, I feel so in control.

I’ve had the same route for months now, but every now and then I’ll have to cover another route, which is no big deal. Like I said, average town, I’ve driven this whole place hundreds of times so nothing is new to me.

This new route I’m driving takes me through the outskirts of town. It was completely normal, until it wasn’t. My first day driving it, while passing over a small bridge that extends over a very small river, I noticed a person in an old worn-out jacket with the hood on, standing with their forearms on the railing, just looking straight down into the water.

This wasn’t strange or alarming in the slightest. Until I continued to see them in the same position. Each day. Never looking up from the side of the bridge. Same exact outfit: the jacket, dirty cargo pants, and work boots. I was convinced it had to be a mannequin or a puppet, but Halloween wasn’t for another month. Plus, I could just tell it was a real person. I could see the side of their weathered face. I wasn’t sure of gender or age, but I could definitely see some wrinkles and a hint of dark brown hair swaying out of the side of the hood.

On the third day, I tried honking to see if it would get a reaction, but still, nothing. I kind of laughed it off. By the time I got back home I hadn’t been thinking about it that much. Then curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to drive out that way. Just to see. And I’ll be damned.

They’re still there. Same spot. Same posture.

I parked my car in a small lot just past the bridge and got out.

At this moment, I’m just wondering what I’ll say. I wasn’t thinking anything weird, supernatural, or scary. Honestly, my main thought was just that I have to make sure I’m not going crazy and imagining this person. As I get closer, I start to make up a sad story about a person who lost someone and is contemplating suicide. I wonder if I have what it takes to talk someone down from the edge. 

As I step onto the bridge, I look around to see if anyone else is here, maybe a car or bike, but nothing. It’s just me and them. I’m now just a few feet away, and I hear them mumbling under their breath, but I can’t make out anything.

“Hey there…” I say as I step up to them, now side by side. “How you doing today?”

No immediate reaction, but they do stop mumbling. Now that I can see more of their face, it’s clear that it is an older man, maybe in his mid-fifties. He is still just staring down at the river, so I look over the edge to see if there is anything down there.

Nothing but water. No giant monster. No boat full of clowns. What is he staring at?

When I look back up to him, I almost jump out of my skin. He’s staring at me now. I feel silly for jumping, because this wasn’t some boogeyman, some phantom missing half his face. It was just an old man. Just as ordinary as any other, though something does catch me off guard. I’ve never seen another human being wear their emotions on their face quite like he is. It almost looks like those old shell shock pictures you’ll see of soldiers, or even someone who’s just survived a bombing. 

By the time I gather myself enough to speak, he beats me to the punch.

“It’s never enough. It’ll never be enough.” He says, staring straight into my soul. His foul breath causes me to lean my head away from him, but he just gets closer and never breaks eye contact. “It will never be enough.”

I finally snap out of it. This man needs help. He needs someone to talk to more than anyone I’ve ever encountered. Now, I don’t know for sure if he is mentally unwell, or just emotional and maybe suicidal. But I feel deep down, maybe, just maybe, I was put on Earth to help this man at his lowest moment.

I will not let this man’s story end here.

“Hey, buddy. It’s going to be okay, alright?” I say sympathetically “Let’s talk this out. I’ll start by introducing myself. My name is Zach, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”

The old man breaks his gaze and looks back down over the bridge.

“When will it be enough? Why can’t they see?” I hear him whisper.

“I’m sure anything that’s going on is something we can sit and have a chat about. I know a good brunch spot not far from here. My treat.” I have to get this man away from the edge of this bridge. Though he hasn’t jumped yet, maybe he doesn’t have the gall. I quickly push that thought out of my head. It’s a selfish way of thinking. Not everyone who’s committed suicide did it on the first and only time they thought about it.

He doesn’t waver.

“Why don’t we get away from edge?” I say, polite but firm, and place my hand on his shoulder.

He looks back up at me with the same, pain-ridden face. Then he lunges at me and grabs my shoulders.

What the hell?!

“Hey!” I shout.

He pulls me with more strength than a man of his age should have. He’s trying to push me to the edge of the bridge.

Fight or flight kicks in and I grab the old man by the waist and try to push him away, but he slings me to the side and is now holding me with my lower back against the railing. I feel my back bend over the edge and notice the look in his eyes – is it crazier that he seems so unfazed by this confrontation? In his eyes is still the same deep sorrow as when I first saw them.

“Knock it off, man! I was just trying to help.” I scream.

I lean my body forward towards him to shift my weight and avoid going over. He holds on tight to me. I try to viciously shake and make him lose his grip. Once I feel some breathing room, I shove him just as hard as I can. I am no longer in his grasp.

He staggers backwards and hits the rail. His balance is gone and without it he flips over the rail and off the bridge without making so much as a single noise.

Too much has happened in such a short amount of time that my body doesn’t know how to react. I’m feet away from the edge, but I’m much too scared to look over and confirm my deepest fear.

I killed this man.

I pushed him off the bridge.

But it was self-defense. He attacked me! He was trying to jump anyway. Maybe he was just trying to take someone with him. He was too afraid to do it alone. What do I do? Did anyone see me?                

Looking frantically at my surroundings, I verify that I am undeniably alone. No one saw a thing. There are no houses, cars, or bystanders. And even if there were, they wouldn’t have seen what happened. It was an accident, one man protecting himself. 

I take a deep slow breath, walk to the rail, and peek over.

The water is shallow. Barely a river at all. Mostly rocks. Just heaps and heaps of rocks.

Then, of course, the motionless corpse sprawling out on the rocks. Blood spilling out, seaming with the faint excuse of a river.

 

I don’t quite remember walking back to my car, but before I knew it, I was on the road, then I was in bed, then I was asleep. Asleep, and dreaming of the old man. Never enough. Why can’t they see?

 I awoke in the dead of night wondering what that meant. Wondering why I didn’t call the police. What if he is alive down there? The thought departs just as soon as it occurs. Even if he was *then*, no way he would be *now*.

I was a shell of myself the next few days, and people were taking notice.

“You okay? Everything alright? You’re not yourself.” They would say. Much in the way I had asked that old man.

“Just a little under the weather.” I’d say.

I check almost hourly on Facebook, on the local news. How has no one found this poor old man? Was he truly not missed? Has no one looked down over the railing of that bridge? Has the river risen since then and washed the body away?

Guilt was consuming me.

I’d have to go check.

This must be why they say killers always return to the scene of the crime. I go back and forth in my head about that. Did I just admit I’m a killer? Just because I’m the reason someone died, doesn’t mean I’m a killer, does it?

Before I know it, I’m back and parked in that same spot from several days ago, only a much different person. Anxious, paranoid, terrified. I walk back to the bridge in broad daylight. Traffic is light, but some cars do pass by without a care, unlike me.

I go straight to the edge and look over. He hasn’t moved. The water is still low, and I notice a couple of birds pecking at his flesh. I don’t have a weak stomach, and it was more likely my nerves and the everything setting in, but I grab hold of the rail and heave chunks of this morning’s breakfast over the edge.

I can’t continue to just leave him here. “What is wrong with me?” I think repeatedly, until I ultimately call 911.

The cops that show up don’t ask too many questions, they don’t hound me. They don’t seem to care all that much. It almost pisses me off. Why is this person not important? If it were me who fell, would they have taken the same, nonchalant approach? God damn it, I’m the one that pushed him over!

But of course, I didn’t tell them that. It was self-defense, but it was just easier to say, I was walking by and just happened to look over. They went on to explain that he was just some homeless guy who had been in the area for a while. Longer than even the middle-aged officer had been there.

The last words the older officer spoke before he left and the ambulance hauled away the body bag keep sticking with me: “At least we know no one’s going to miss ‘em.”

What a way to think about the loss of another human being. Maybe he was just trying to look on the bright side. Sure, it would have been worse if it was causing someone or someone’s grief, but is it not worse to not be missed? To be forgotten completely? There is something bittersweet and beautiful about being missed.

I’ve still been keeping my distance from people. I’ll work, come home, and try to look at my phone or watch TV until I fall asleep. I keep seeing his face, time and time again. Night in, night out. And those final words, “When will it be enough? Why can’t they see?”

He must have meant his suffering. How much pain of going through his existence was enough? When would it be enough? Unfortunately, I must have caught him at that breaking point. He must have been so angry that just when he was at the cusp of ending it, here I come to try and take that away from him.

Sleep was difficult, but it got better. For a while, things went back to normal. I went back to being that same social butterfly that I was. I guess even the most traumatic events can’t take that out of you if its roots are too strong. But like with anything else in life, once you forget about something, life has a way of making sure you remember.

 

**One Week Later**

 

The color of my coffee at this place is different every single time, despite ordering the same thing every single time. How difficult is it to get an iced mocha latte right? I take it anyway and give back a smile and thanks.

As I exit the coffee shop, I notice something that nearly makes me drop the seven-dollar drink on the pavement.

It can’t be. No, it’s not. I know it’s not.

Sitting on the street corner with a small empty cup, is the old man from the bridge. Same outfit. Same emotion filled gaze. Same everything.

I had gone weeks without thinking of that face. It had faded from the deepest corner of my mind. I’d stopped dreaming about the man. Almost as if he didn’t exist.

Yet here he is. Feet away from me.

Impossible.

I step closer. I must be projecting his face onto this man. It’s a memory lapse. I’ve had them before when thinking about various people from high school. I don’t risk getting any closer. This isn’t good for my mental health.

I promptly turn around and walk back to my car.

People always talk about how unrealistic it is in horror movies when the lead just brushes things off and goes about things normally, but that is actually one of the *most* realistic occurrences in a horror movie. What are you supposed to do? Real life isn’t as simple as just uprooting everything at the first sign of terror. You can’t just stop going to work, you can’t just move from the haunted house you put a huge down payment on.

You persist.

You ignore.

You block out even the slightest thought about anything bad.

But then, much like in the movies, it finds its way to creep back in and make it impossible for you to forget.

I am back on my normal route. I’m starting to enjoy work again. I’ve missed the carefree escape that driving brings me. After a few deliveries, I notice an inconsistency in my route. It is taking me way out of the way for this next package. By the time I realize where it’s taking me, I’m already there.

Someone must be up to this. Maybe they saw what happened and are blackmailing me? This bridge isn’t even technically a physical address. How can a package be delivered here? After parking the truck and walking back to look at the box, sure enough, it has this exact location printed on the label. Even the coordinates.

The box is small. Smallest I’ve delivered in a while. It fells empty. The place on the tag where the name should be looks like it’s been rubbed off, the ink is smudged and still wet when I run my finger over it.

How did this end up here? I walk across the road, unto the bridge and place the package down. I’m just doing my job. This is where it told me to take it, after all. When I look down again, I notice that the smear of ink on my finger isn’t there anymore. So, I bend back down and pick up the package.

It has my fucking name on it.

Zach W. Looney.

The ink is dry as bone.

I push my fear and perplexity to the side and rip this package open, just tearing into the side of the tiny box like an animal. In doing so I also rip through the contents. An empty paper coffee cup.

 

I finish the route, which is completely normal the rest of the way. When I get home my paranoia is on high alert. I’m consistently looking over my shoulder, checking behind doors, under my bed. Peeking out the blinds from time to time. When I know for sure I’m alone, I begin to do some research.

I find a single article about the death of the homeless man who jumped to his death from a bridge on 3^(rd) Street. It wasn’t even headlining material. It’s almost election season, there are much more important matters.

But I keep digging. I find an article talking about a homeless man who lived under the same bridge about 30 years prior. But of course, there are no pictures. It just talks of a town hall meeting to try and help him get back on his feet. There *is* a name at the bottom of the article, though.

By Lucy Dee Miller.

Facebook gives me a hand full of matches, and after clicking through them, I find one that’s a sure thing. She is an ex-columnist from here who looks to be in her mid-sixties, so I send her a message with the link to the article.

 

 

Zach: Hey, this might sound strange, but did you write this article?

 

She doesn’t get back to me right away so I’m killing time by walking around my apartment from window-to-window, checking for any signs of irregular activity. Then I hear a *ding*!

 

Lucy: where did you find this?

 

Zach: Google. I know it’s weird, but may I ask if it had a feel-good ending?

 

Lucy: …

 

Lucy: …

 

Lucy: can we meet in person?

 

I drive to the address she sends me, making sure to keep an eye out for anything unruly, but nothing out of the ordinary happens. I arrive at the two-story brick house located in downtown. It’s an old house, but it’s visibly been taken care off. The yard is well maintained and has some beautiful rose and lavender bushes.

Lucy meets me at the door. “Come on in.” she smiles and closes the door behind me as I walk in. The inside of the home smells floral and is filled with stacks of books and different newspaper articles covering the walls. 

She tells me to sit and offers me coffee or tea, as I imagine any old lady would, so I accept as I know they would want. I sit down on the plaid couch and place the steaming cup of coffee on the table, next to a nearly completed jigsaw puzzle of jellybeans. 

“So, you want to talk about Two Cane, huh?” she says as she sits in the rocking chair beside me.

“Huh?” I say, confused. “Who’s Two Cane?”

“Well, that’s who the article’s about. Two Cane Samuel.” She takes a sip from her cup. “Called him that ‘cause he always walked around with two canes: one wooden, one aluminum.”

“Well then, I guess that is why I’m here.” I say and then compose myself. No turning back now. “What happened to him?”

“About a week after I wrote that article, he died. Suicide they called it.” She takes another sip before finishing. “Jumped off a bridge.”

My heart sinks.

“Why would he do that, though? If you all were going to help him?”

“That was the question on everyone’s mind. They chalked it up to him being embarrassed. Imagine that. He wasn’t embarrassed to be living under a bridge, he wasn’t embarrassed about begging for money or food to eat. But he was embarrassed because he was about to get help.”

“Yeah, that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.” I ponder my next question, but before I can ask, she blurts out.

“I’ll tell you what I think happened.” She leans in and gets almost face to face with me, lowering her voice to a much more serious tone. “I think the city killed him.”

I don’t even remember what I was going to ask.

“What?” I question.        

“They were never going to help him. If they did, they would be opening a whole can of worms. Who knows how many people would end up on their doorsteps? You did it for him, why can’t you do it for me? No. They wanted good publicity without having to actually do anything. If that meant getting rid of some old man with no family or reason to live, so be it.”

“Wow.” Now I remember my question “Long shot, but are there any photos of him anywhere?”

“Just a second.” She says before she sits her cup down on top of the puzzle and walks over to a stack of boxes in the corner of the room. She down stacks the boxes and begins to open each one, until she finds what she’s looking for. “Here we go. This was going to be on the front of the article.” She hands me a small Polaroid photograph.

Despite all the impossibilities, all the doubt, part of me knew this man was going to look familiar. I’m caught in a trance looking down at the photo that confirms my waking nightmares.

My reaction must have caught her off guard. “So, what is this all for anyway? Is it like an essay or something?” she asks to fill the silence.

I look up from the photo and back to her with what I’m sure is not a very convincing face and nod. “Yes, thank you. Thank you for your help.” I say as I hand the photo back to her. The photo of the old man who I just pushed off a bridge, the same bridge he supposedly fell from 30 years ago.

One final thought pops into my head “Where is he buried?” I ask as I stand up.

There is a hesitation before she speaks “They don’t waste the time and space burying the homeless.” She says coldly. “If no one claims the body after a few days, they burn it. I heard they scattered his ashes into the river. Technically speaking, he fell from that bridge twice.”

I need to lie down.

I leave Lucy’s house in a rush and make it back to my car. After driving around, I end up back at the coffee shop. I look around for the homeless man from before, but he is nowhere to be found. When was the last time I had sleep? I’m exhausted, but I know I couldn’t fall asleep if I tried. I figure a latte with a double shot might do me some good.

In the car waiting for it to cool down, I work up the nerve to take a sip. Not too hot now. My second drink is more of a gulp, but as it hits my mouth, something is wrong. Very wrong. A foul powdery substance turns too mush in my mouth. I spit it out as quickly as I can, not caring about the mess I’m making in the car. I spit again and again to get the taste out.

What happened to this drink? Did the barista do something horribly wrong? I take the lid off to see what’s going on in the cup.

Ashes.

The cup is filled all the way to the top with ashes.

No sign that there was ever any type of liquid in the cup.

I saw them make the drink. I felt the way it moved in the cup on the way back to the car. I took a sip, damn it! It was coffee.

Just to avoid getting called crazy and thrown into a nuthouse, I don’t go back inside with the cup. I’m sure it would’ve turned back to liquid somehow. I’m past the point of questioning anything now.

In a rage of confusion and fatigue, I drive. I drive back to that bridge.

But I take the cup with me.

Not caring about if anyone is watching, I walk up to the bridge and yell out “What do you want from me? Huh?” I pour the ashes over the side and into the river. “Is this what you want?”

The wind carries the ashes down gracefully, but It’s not the ashes that catch my attention. It’s the river itself. Its changing before my very eyes.

Then I ultimately see what it was that old man was looking at all this time. How had I not seen it before? He wasn’t trying to push me over the edge, he was just trying to make me see. I glare down in shock and awe of the mountain of bodies that litters the ground below. I realize there is no water, not even sure there is ground. The cadavers are packed so tightly together, teeming. Almost as if they are one cohesive unit, fused together. Just flesh and bone. Faces. So many weeping faces. Lost. Forgotten. Neglected. Covered in blood. Grime. Filth. 

It might be endless. In the moment, I wonder if maybe it reaches the ends of the earth. It shatters me. Shakes me to my core, staring down at the hell on earth. The sound of the cries drown out all other sounds, yet it was so silent just mere seconds ago. 

I think to myself in this moment: When will it ever be enough? Nothing will ever be enough.
