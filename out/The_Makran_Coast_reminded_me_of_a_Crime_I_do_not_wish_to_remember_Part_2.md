Before we begin the conclusion of this dreadful tale, I cannot begin to express the shear gratitude I have, sharing my experience from the safety of my home.

*

It may have been early afternoon the next day when I was awoken by a vague scratching sound, it was my disposition that I was dreaming. My bedside window was open just a crack, and I turned to my left side away from the wind, hoping for sleep to return like an old friend. I was startled to learn the persistent scratching in fact came from within the walls, it started in my bedroom and walked slyly on something sharp and pointy towards the corner table in the sitting room. The scratching zig zagged aggressively and halted with my looming presence. I returned to bed and realised my attempts for rest were futile, I had a nagging ache in my temples, and it was a mystery to me the number of hours I had slept during the night. For I remained awake with the drapes of my eyelids closed. I finished getting dressed and was leaving the room when a frosty chill tickled the back of my neck, it was odd that time of the day. I turned to close the bedside window and that was when my ears began to file an uncanny whisper in the wind that my mind refused to comprehend, something which had travelled on a thick and oppressive gust from the coast; called my name.     
  
I simply could not and would not accept the illusions which were manifesting around me, I asked myself if I was losing it completely in the head, in these lonely parts. I had begun to doubt myself and it was more terrifying to me than all the extraordinary theatrics. Abandoning my self-interview, I made myself fresh in the bathroom, hoping the cold water would put a fresh coat of paint on my increasingly pale face, it did little in that regard, though my bristling skin welcomed the numbing coldness into its cavities. And with that I endeavoured for breakfast, forgetting dinner time was nearby, and became nauseous with the thought of consumption. I surrendered to the easeful sofas of the sitting room for a while, and soon found myself pacing between the walls as though I was a ball being hit by an unseen squash racket. Maybe it was my compounding anxiety or more simply, the breaking of my usual routine; awaking to a Makran sunrise, stretching as I replenished with tea, journaling for my blog and typically ending the day with the wonderment of an undiscovered book.    
  
I headed to the front balcony and pondered over my despondency; the Makran sunset said a painful goodbye with ghastly shades which tormented me. A thick gust returned from the shore, and I was alarmed by a familiar whine from a rocking chair next to me. My hands trembled. I stood in a peculiar anticipation. In the apex of a dusty mist which teased the hut, a man approached me.   
  
‘Hello, Doctor. We meet at last. My apologies for the delay.’ He said with a silky inevitability which had tested me.     
  
‘And you’re Gopal?’ I asked to reassure myself. I decided to look past the absence because I was glad to finally speak to someone after a while.     
  
‘Indeed.’    
  
‘I trust you have been keeping well doctor?’ Gopal said with a wry smile.    
  
I wasn’t sure if the light sarcasm to the tone of his voice was intended, and his English could have tricked me into believing he lived in Birmingham. Inside the hut, I inspected him more closely as he removed his keffiyeh. His complexion was olive as the few locals I had seen, though his skin bloomed with the vigour of an alien youth which no storm could conquer in Makran. His jet-black hair extended below his shoulders and was very thin. He walked to the sitting room athletically and I followed.   
  
‘Good, beyond my delusions.’ We were sat across each other on armchairs next to the fireplace. I was closer to the flames, yet my hands continued to jitter.    
  
‘Yes. Tell me of these......Delusions.’    
  
I spoke in colour off the disturbances, my battle with addiction, the state of my mental health and lack off appetite which was something new, I had become weak rapidly with my arrival. Through it all I couldn’t tell if Gopal was moved or assured, he just stared and nodded with a perplexing emptiness in his smile. Periodically he oscillated the tips of his fingernails on the armrest, they were red, not felt tip red or nail polish red; translucent red, similar in shade to the yellow beneath the surface of your nails which took several washes to remove when you had dipped too deep in a Karahi dish. When I had finished my tale of woe, Gopal pulled two Z-eplon pills from a weathered crossbody bag he had removed; I accepted without words.   
  
‘They will restore your colour, friend.’   
  
‘We must prepare you for pilgrimage, are you ready?’ Gopal asked hypnotically.   
  
It was arranged before my arrival that I would attend the temple which honoured the former Sultan Ibn-Wahab. Harold had me intrigued and we followed up with Gopal as needed and any requirements, which I’d just address in Makran.    
  
‘Yes,’ I said with an uncertain conviction.    
  
Gopal headed for the trap door, and I followed him down the ancient stairwell; it felt a touch wider, and I couldn’t understand why I was unable to register the sound of Gopal’s footsteps. The heavy steel door almost opened with the force of his presence, and we stood in the front half of an enclosure lit by five candles which made the shape of a circle.   
  
Gopal asked me to lay down in the circle and close my eyes, I obliged on compulsion.    
  
‘It is your wish to see Melody, yes?’   
  
‘Yes.’   
  
‘It is your desire to atone for your sins, yes?’   
  
‘Yes.’   
  
‘And you pledge your allegiance to the Sultan and the way of the Salaf, yes?’   
  
‘Yes.’    
  
‘Then you give us permission to ENTER, yes?’   
  
‘Yes.’ I said once more, after some hesitation.    
  
I recognised the weight of radiance lift from my eyelids and a paralysing commotion entered my brain from the depths of a hell in which I became a corpse; unmoved and undisturbed. Then, as though a jet engine had shutdown uncommanded, I passed out in a trance.    
  
I was on the bed, positioned uncomfortably on my belly when I awoke. I rotated my body to the mattress and felt a burning sensation on the padding of my upper back, it was ignored when I jumped at an elongated shadow near the foot of my bed; in my befuddled state, I made out Gopal from the unsettling length of his hair.    
  
‘You are prepared. The pilgrimage must now begin.’ Gopal said with intensified vocal cords, removed from his earlier neutrality.    
  
‘At this hour? I am weak and tired, can we not wait till tomorrow?’    
  
‘You are now prepared, it’s auspicious. Your sacrifice will bring great reward.’   
  
‘What off Harold? I was hoping he’d have joined us, seeing it was his idea and he does love this sort of thing,’ I said.     
  
‘Who is Harold?’   
  
‘I beg your pardon.’   
  
‘I am not acquainted with this name.’   
  
‘Our mutual friend?’   
  
‘I must apologies. I have never known a Mr. Harold, doctor,’ Gopal said with the hint of a wry smile which he concealed well. Though I debated whether I had turned into a mad man, I parked the thought.   
  
My interest in travelling to the temple had dwindled and there was a small voice inside of me, which was screaming that I shouldn’t go. There was also a deeper voice which was more aggressive, it said that I could no longer be alone in the Hut, that I didn’t need to be responsible for myself anymore. That I could just let go. My depression was magnifying as I fought with the demons in my head, and it was during this battle that Gopal interceded, and pledged more Z-eplon if I agreed with him.    
  
\*   
  
We set off for the temple in the gloom. A shimmering moonlight guided us across a soulless land. A gale kept encouraging my quivering legs away from Jiwani and towards the coastal wetland.    
  
The Hut had long been left behind and I could no longer make out the profile of the dead town from where I came. The vast emptiness disordered me further and my inner fuel light turned on. I saw no one and the silence roared from hell and heaven. Gopal observed my discomfort and broke the dim tranquillity in the air.     
  
‘You’ve done well doctor. Soon, the door will open, and the exchange will complete. You will enter the kingdom of the original occupants, planted in a soil from the Earth’s warmest core. It will stand taller than the sky, blinding you as the sun with diamonds which wrap its fort tower.’   
  
‘Are we close?’ I simply responded, as I did not have the function in my brain to respond to Gopal’s wild eulogy, though I welcomed the noise.    
  
‘Yes, not long now.’   
  
We walked for ten more minutes, and Gopal stalled abruptly.    
  
‘What’s wrong?’ I said.    
  
‘I can continue no further, you must go alone.’   
  
‘But why?!’ I said, feeling the uprising of a hidden rage in me.    
  
‘It is the way. Along this path, you will find a forest, and there you shall enter the Kingdom.’   
  
I felt my knees crack against the clustered pebbles below me and tears dripped on my knuckles, as if my eyes were a tap with worn rubber seals. As I struggled to my feet, I received that unwelcoming feeling in my belly, of something not quite right. Gopal had vanished.   
  
A coercive kinetic energy in the air, pushed me towards impending doom.   
  
I could see the portrait of a dense forest which was moving closer to me. The trees were propped on a pack of disjointed legs which sprawled in a line of war. I ignored the irregularity in my breathing and moved inside with a push from an unnatural force. The excessiveness of hoisted timber immediately surprised me. I could not make out land or ocean to both my sides, and ahead there was a track between trees, with their carnal desire and disfigured legs which were within touching distance; they aggravated my nausea, and I vomited bile. I pushed on every drop off energy that remained in what was left of my body, through augmented shadows which reined on me.    
  
I made it to a clearing.    
  
There, I saw the promised temple. There were no diamonds which glistened or a towering fortress. I stood among tainted ruins. Walls had crumbled all around me, algae smeared half pillars and chunks of nothingness which remained. Parasitic tendrils that sprawled under the forest trees, uprooted blocks of stone, piling them on top of each other, a large circular stone; throned above.    
  
I crawled to the top and my fingers grasped a small axe which was there.   
  
A five-pointed star had been carved into the stone.   
  
In the centre, was an embalmed hand which clawed at me. Severed limbs had amassed around it.    
  
The ropy canals of my ears rallied, to pick up a neighbourly voice which had been hushed from afar, it said ‘Don’t do it you fool! Please NO!’   
  
I stretched my left hand against the slab, subconsciously lifted the axe, and aimed for my wrist.    
  
The embalmed hand turned into a wet crimson.    
  
I screamed a sound from lungs which were no longer human.    
  
Someone or something grabbed me, and a switch flicked in my brain. I instinctively used my good hand to clutch its throat. I kept blinking my eyes to clear the blur and saw my friend.    
  
I begged it to stop.    
  
It was too late.   
  
I had squeezed the life from Harold.   
  
A loud silence echoed in a peace that would never be. The wind blew with a force I had become accustomed to, and I heard her call from the shore.   
  
‘Oh my Abdus, come to me! Come home my beloved.’   
  
I began my long walk to freedom, towards the Ocean which would purify me.     
  
I would bathe in the alluring scent of apples    
  
And rejoice in the Makran sun one final time.
