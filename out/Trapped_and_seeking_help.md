I never really used to experience headaches. Sure, I had the occasional momentary stress headache, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. But one day this pain started to build behind my eyes, and since then I get these incredibly painful headaches. They're so intense that I can barely function. But it's not just the pain that's the problem. Whenever I get one of these headaches, I start seeing these figures. At first, I thought they were just hallucinations. I mean, who wouldn't think that, right?

For months I’ve been having those headaches, seeing the figures. I tried everything to get rid of them - taking painkillers, getting more sleep, eventually even going to the doctor - but nothing seemed to work. Then one day, something happened.

I was walking down the street, feeling that pressure behind the eyes, trying to make it home before another headache hit me. It was only a matter of time before I was seeing the figures again. Unfortunately, this time was different. As I turned a corner, I bumped into one of them.

Until that moment, the figures had just been standing there, motionless. Previously I’d avoided them. Couldn’t really tell you why, but I always walked around them. The moment I made contact, every single one of them started staring at me. I tried to ignore them, hoping it was yet another hallucination. But then the headaches got worse. And with each headache, I started seeing more and more of the figures. It got harder and harder to ignore them.

And then I happened to look one in the eye. I didn't do it on purpose or anything, my eyes just happened to stop there. I shouldn't have done that. All of the figures started sprinting towards me. I didn't know what to do. I was frozen in fear. I realized that I had to run. So I did.

I don't know for how long I’ve been running, but it felt like hours. I don’t even know how I managed to run so long. The figures were always behind me, chasing me. I never looked back, but I could hear their feet pounding on the pavement and on the streets. I don’t know where I went, I just knew that I had to get away from them.

Finally, I stumbled upon an old abandoned building. I didn't hesitate, I just ran inside and slammed the door shut behind me. I’m safe. For now. But I know that the figures are still out there, waiting for me. Eventually, they will find me.

I don’t know what will happen if they do find me. I’m not willing to take the chance.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've been stuck in this abandoned building for hours now, hiding from the figures. But they're not leaving, they’re waiting for me. I can't take it anymore. I need help. I can hear them outside. I think they’re trying to open the windows. Please, someone, anyone, help me.
