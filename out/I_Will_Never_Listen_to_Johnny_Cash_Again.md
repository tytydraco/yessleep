Hey everyone. This is the first time I've posted on r/nosleep, but I've had something bizarre happen recently, and I think this is the best place to share. I need to know if anyone else has encountered anything like this, or if I'm just going mad.

My uncle was a scientist, an eccentric one at that. His obsession was with brain transplants, and he'd constantly tell tales of how he’d swapped brains between animals. As creepy as it sounds, I always thought he was just pulling my leg. That was until last week.

He called me over one day, saying he had a "surprise" for me. When I arrived, he excitedly led me to his lab. At the center was a chicken. But this wasn’t any ordinary chicken. Its eyes were different, they had this sort of... human recognition? My uncle, with a wild grin on his face, confessed, “I've done it! I've transplanted a human brain into this chicken!” I laughed it off as one of his silly stories again. But what he said next sent shivers down my spine: "It's Johnny Cash's brain." 

You see, my uncle was always a fan of Johnny Cash, always playing his songs and raving about him. The claim seemed too absurd to be real. However, the chicken soon began to... sing. It was the unmistakable deep voice of Johnny Cash, singing "Chicken in Black." I couldn’t believe my ears. This was no trick; this chicken was legit.

Days passed, and things grew even stranger. Every time I'd visit my uncle's place, the chicken would be there, crooning old Johnny Cash tunes, and my uncle would be laughing, so proud of his creation.

But soon, something dark began to manifest. One evening, I woke up to a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was a man, dressed in black, with a chicken's head. In a deep, haunting voice, it crooned, "I'm the chicken in black, and I'm back." It then vanished into thin air.

Every night after, the chicken-man would appear, each time coming closer, whispering in that same haunting voice about wanting his life back, wanting his brain back. I could feel the despair and sadness in those words. But what terrified me even more was the realization that Johnny Cash's consciousness might truly be trapped in that chicken, and this spectral figure was the manifestation of his torment.

My uncle didn't believe me when I told him. But one fateful night, he too saw the apparition. He was terrified and filled with guilt. In his attempt to reverse the procedure, he tragically lost his own life. 

The chicken vanished the next day, and the apparitions stopped. But sometimes, on a quiet night, if I listen closely, I can hear a distant, haunting voice singing, "Chicken in black..."

If anyone has ever come across anything remotely like this, or knows how to put a lost soul to rest, please, I beg you, let me know. And always remember: never mess with the souls of the departed.
