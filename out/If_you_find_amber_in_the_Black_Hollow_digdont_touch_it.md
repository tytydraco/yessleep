I know how this sounds. I *know*. But if you’re reading this and you're working anywhere near Site 72 at Black Hollow Ridge, you need to *listen to me*. This isn’t a prank. It’s not some lonely field researcher trying to get attention. I’m posting this with one good eye and a bleeding cheekbone. I am *not* okay.

Let me start from the beginning. I'm Dr. Elise Munro, field archaeologist, second year on this cursed ridge. Mostly we’ve found the usual: rusted tools, broken bones, odd burial trinkets. But yesterday morning, while combing one of the older grave mounds, my pick struck something hard. Something that *glowed*. In the sun

At first, I thought it was a chunk of tree sap—amber, deep orange, with these spiderweb fractures across the center like old glass. And it was. Amber, I mean. But inside...there was something curled up.

Not a bug. Not a lizard. Not anything I’ve ever seen.

It was *humanoid*.

Maybe six inches long. Wings, like a dragonfly’s, curled tight against its back. Too many teeth for its size, lips peeled back and fangs bared. And its face—God, its face—looked like something pretending to be human. Like a child’s drawing of an adult, half right and half *wrong*.

I should’ve called someone. I should’ve radioed camp. But I was *curious*. Hell, I’ve published papers on folklore artifacts. I even joked with myself, *“Did I just find a goddamn fairy?”*

So, I brought it to my camper.

I told myself I’d catalog it properly in the morning. But after dark, with the wind scraping outside and the ridge empty but for my own heartbeat...I couldn’t stop looking at it. I turned on the desk lamp and got out my precision tools.

I wanted to see it up close. It was stupid. I know it was stupid. But I couldn’t *help* myself. Hey, who hasn’t wanted to see a fairy? I didn’t think that’s what it was. Not really. That’s just what it looked like.

The moment I started trimming the amber, I swear to God the thing *twitched*. Just once. Like a dream where something shifts in the corner of your eye. I laughed it off. Kept cutting.

By 2 AM, the amber cracked wide open. It made this tiny *hiss*, like steam escaping.

And then the creature blinked.

I didn’t even scream. I was too frozen. My expectations when the amber was cracked open was that I would be able to hold a small, perfectly preserved body. I wanted to see if I could figure out if it was a type of mammal or an insect, if there was chitin or something else.

But instead, it sat up, its back cracking like twigs bending the wrong way. It looked straight at me with eyes the color of rot. Then it bared all those teeth at me, snarling like a dog.

The damn thing *leapt* off the table.

It was so fast. So goddamn fast. I felt a wet *snap* on my cheek—and then I was bleeding. My skin was hanging like soft meat off the bone. It *bit* me. Took a piece of my face like I was a pear being peeled.

I stumbled back, knocking over my chair. The thing hissed again, wings buzzing. I swear it was *grinning*. I don’t remember grabbing the hotplate, but I must’ve, because I swung it hard enough to crack the countertop. Did I hit it? I don’t know. But it gave me enough time to run.

I locked myself in the camper bathroom and didn’t come out until sunrise. It must have gotten out through the cracked window above the kitchen sink, because I could hear it skittering on the roof all night.

When it finally stopped, I bolted the door, packed what I could, and wrote this warning.

I left the amber shell outside, by the red utility crate near Ridge Marker 7. Make sure you avoid pulling anything like that out of the ground. It’s a coffin. Or a seal. Or—I don’t know. Just leave them in the ground.

My name is Elise Munro. And I quit.
