Julie knew the three-hour drive from Burberry to the North Woods First Nations reserve all too well. Highway 13 stretched out for miles before merging onto Highway 6. She made a quick pit stop in Hollowsville, a quaint paper mill town, for a much-needed coffee and bathroom break, then continued. The rocky landscape between Hollowsville and her childhood home in the Northern Woods was always stunning in the fading twilight – her mother loved to call them the Wajiwiinsan (Little Mountains) in Ojibwe. Even with the trees bare, the scenery was a spectacular sight and a refreshing change from the city's smog and busy traffic.

Julie stopped at the small bridge connecting the mainland to the island, and idled patiently, waiting for the light to change. During the busy summer months, the bridge swung open every hour to accommodate an influx of large seasonal boats. But in November, just after sunset, it appeared deserted, as did the sleepy town of Little River that lay just beyond it. Her phone beeped in the seat next to her, a text message.

**Mom:** "Watch out for deer on the road! Love you."

Julie's thumbs moved deftly over the keypad: "No worries. See you soon. Xo."

Driving alone at night made her acutely aware of her solitude. The occasional flicker of wildlife eyes was the only break in the emptiness. Then, about a half mile ahead, she spotted something enormous standing in the middle of the road; a buck, the biggest she'd ever seen. The car slowed to a complete stop a safe distance away, and she peered over the dash, surveying him carefully. He was tall and magnificent. Antlers stretched majestically upward from his head, looking regal and poised like a picture frozen in time.

Julie nodded. "Boozhoo, Waawashkesh," she said with a tone of respect. His gaze fixed somewhere beyond the glare at the windshield, a sight that sent an inexplicable shiver down Julie's spine. Then, suddenly, the buck sprang toward her; the sickening thud of his body collapsing against the hood was followed by the shattering of her windshield. Glass pieces peppered her skin as his antlers thrust through the broken glass, mere inches from her face. Lydia screamed in terror as she pushed back in the seat as far as she could. Her hand fumbled with the door; there was an awful grinding sound as it shimmied it open. The buck's convulsions caused the hood to groan under its weight. It stared blankly, eyes bloodied and bulging in a way that would haunt her forever.

Julie stumbled out onto the roadway and into a pair of oncoming headlights. A horn blared loudly, causing her heart to jump. She lunged out of the way as the other vehicle flew past and came to a screeching halt. She collapsed onto the cold pavement.

The last thing she saw was a blurry shape approaching, and a man's warbled voice spoke as she faded into unconsciousness, "Miss? Miss? Are you alright? Help is on the way."

\---

The rattle of a med cart and the murmur of voices outside her room jolted her out of a nightmare. When she opened her eyes, the images floated, impressed like a misty mirage before her. But instead of a deer, a young man about her age stood there unflinching against a vast, empty darkness with his arms folded across his chest. "Lora," his voice echoed like a chant in a big room. The car rushed toward him. The brakes were failing; she couldn't stop the collision from happening.

"Miss Wabigwan?" Nurse Lumley's voice broke through the haze. Julie blinked, and the dream dissipated like a fine mist. She struggled to sit up, wincing at the stiffness in her neck.  

"Your neck is giving you trouble, huh?"

Julie nodded. "Yes, where am I?"

Still groggy, she looked around the room and realized it was a hospital room.

"We'll get you something for the pain in a minute. And you're at Little River Hospital. They brought you in late last night. The medics said you hit a *deer* on the road." She said it in a way that implied that Julie was lucky to be alive.

The deer. Julie remembered it all now. The deer had charged at her. "Yeah, he came at me." Gingerly, she touched the cuts on her face, wincing.

Nurse Lumley offered a sympathetic smile. "Well, you're safe now, dear, and don't you worry about those nasty cuts; they'll be gone in no time."  

Julie's mother, Mary walked into the room, carrying two large coffees in a tray. "Good, you're awake." She set the tray on the bedside table and sat next to her.

Nurse Lumley finished fluffing and straightening the pillows. "There, all nice and comfy now." She straightened. "The doctor's going to be in soon to see you. Click the button if you need anything in the meantime." She pointed to the call button at Julie's side. Julie nodded, and the nurse departed.

Her mom opened the tabs on both coffees, letting the steam escape. Julie rested back against the pillows.

"So how are you feeling, Julie?" her mother looked her over, concern etching lines across her face. As a young widow and single mother, her daughter's well-being was always her main priority. There had been many uphill struggles along the way. However, Julie had grown into a beautiful young woman only months away from her bachelor's degree in creative writing; Mary couldn't have been prouder.

Julie thought carefully for a moment, "Well, to be honest, Mom, I feel like I've been run over by a tow truck." They both chuckled. "But now I really just want to get out of here and go home."

"Well, just wait for the doc to come in and look you over first," Mary winked.

As if right on cue, Doctor Swanson strode into the room, wearing a standard white coat with a clipboard clutched in his hand.

"Hello," he said, sounding almost chipper, setting the clipboard on the counter beside him before leaning against it casually. "So, how are we feeling this morning, Julie?" She noticed his lacklustre blue eyes, a clear sign of sleepless hours. She knew that look all too well, having spent many sleepless nights focused on her studies, living on coffee and cigarettes just to get by. Still, she had to credit him for at least trying to sound upbeat.

"I could be better, but I think I'm okay."

"Well. Good, let's take a look then." He walked over and applied gentle pressure to Julie's neck and back. She tried to not wince at the tender parts. When finished, he stepped back and thoughtfully weighed in on the evidence before passing final judgment. "You may have some neck stiffness for a little while, but pain meds should take care of that, and plenty of rest." He cast a side glance at Julie's mother, undoubtedly knowing she'd see to that.

Nurse Lumley re-entered, holding a small pill cup and a glass of water. "Sorry, doctor, but an officer is waiting outside to speak to Julie." She placed the pills and water down, then turned on her heel to exit.

"Well, I guess that's my cue to leave. Take care, Julie, and if anything comes up, then just come back."

Julie downed her meds and then nodded. "I will."

Officer Josh Miigizi came in after Dr. Swanson left. Julie's face lit up. "Josh!" she exclaimed

"Hey Julie, long time no see." He smiled warmly, then turned and nodded at her mom, "Mrs. Waabigwan."  

"Aanii Josh, come on in." She nodded back and smiled; it made her heart glad to see Julie smiling again. Then she got up and conveniently excused herself to find a washroom so they could talk. Julie patted a clear spot on her bed next to her. "come, sit," she commanded.

They spent the next while discussing the details of the accident at length for the report. They then graciously moved on to lighter subjects, like what's been transpiring in their lives up to the present. Julie gave him a quick three-minute summary about her pursuing a Creative Writing degree in Burry, a three-hour commute away. Josh shared he had joined the police force right after high school and returned to the island after his father's passing. He'd inherited his dad's house and lived there ever since.

"Hey, how about I swing by with coffee tomorrow? We can catch up some more."

Julie nodded, a hint of a smile on her lips. "Sure, why not?" They quickly exchanged cell numbers. Suddenly, Josh's police radio crackled at his side; he immediately answered it and then had to leave in a hurry.

Moments later, Mary reappeared, looking more refreshed. "Well? Are you ready to go, daughter?"

"Absolutely!" Julie carefully got up to get ready. The pills eased the discomfort but some stiffness remained.

\---

It was good to be back on the rez again; on the way home, they stopped at Mogey's Variety just past two o'clock corner for some groceries and snacks. The sky was a slate grey; its smooth surface stretched for miles without a break in the cloud surface. It gave the land and the leafless trees a shadowy, colourless feel. Julie wished she had brought her sketchbook and pencils along for the trip.

"You need anything else before we go home?" Her mom interrupted her reverie as she fiddled with the music playlist, trying to get it to play again.

"We're in the dead zone, Mom; you'll have to wait a few secs for the sound to kick in again," Julie pointed upward, signifying there was no service.

Oh, yeah, that's right, you'd think I'd remember that by now," her mom said, relaxing back into her seat again. Sure enough, the music automatically resumed playing only moments later.

The house seemed quiet, as if it were asleep. Her uncle's dog, Benji, from next door, waited near the front steps, his tail wagging cheerfully.

"Awe, Benji," her mom's tone was soft-spoken.

Benji waited for the car to park before circling around to greet Julie. She patted him gently. He was old in years, but still a happy boy, nonetheless.

The door was left unlocked like it usually was during the day, and the familiar scent of cinnamon air freshener told her she was home. Her mom headed to her room to put her purse away, calling back over her shoulder, "Oh, before I forget, Josh dropped off your bag last night; it's by the couch." Julie sighed with immense relief; her laptop and favourite books were in that bag, including a couple of first editions.

It had been quiet that night, and yet she couldn't sleep; the images of the accident kept seeping back into her thoughts. She remembered the name "Lora" and wondered what it all meant. She flipped over to her other side, facing the bookshelf, and spotted the pack of smokes she had left stashed on the second shelf a month ago. It rested on her copy of 'Bear Walker,' she slid one out.

Even though it had been a month since she quit, she couldn't resist the urge to have just one, especially now after the deer and car accident. And then the haunting nightmare, to boot. The whole thing was just too eerie for words. The first drag was the best; it made her feel grounded and connected to the present moment, as did the cold night. She thought about what Josh had said at the hospital. Maybe he was right; perhaps the car lights spooked the deer into panic, and it lost all direction. It really was the only reasonable explanation, the only one that made any sense, anyway. Her phone bleeped in her pocket. It suddenly occurred that she hadn't checked her messages since yesterday. Josh's name appeared on the screen: Hey, hope your all settled in. How about I drop by with coffee around 1ish tomorrow?

**Julie**: Sure! I take mine, black. :)

**Josh:** Okay, see ya then. ;)

SNAP. Julie jumped with a start, nearly dropping her phone. Her eyes immediately scanned the darkness for whatever it was. The hairs on her neck prickled up; she had the uncanny sensation of being watched. Her cigarette had burnt down to the nub, singing her fingers. She shook her hand and winced, then hurried back into the house, locking the doors behind her.

A tall figure stood out from the shadows, unaffected by the cold. Watching the house, his attention immediately drawn to the window where a single light was lit in one room; a woman's slender silhouette grazed by the curtains, and then the light went out.

\---

The savoury scent of bacon sizzling and freshly brewed coffee pulled Julie from sleep. Again, she'd been dreaming of 'him' - the attractive man with dark hair and deep-set eyes, only this time he motioned for her to follow him into dense woods. In the peaceful scene behind him, colourful birds took flight, and a young fawn, its large brown eyes sparkling with innocence, darted amongst the sun-dappled trees. The dream felt so real; she reached out with a pang of yearning to follow him into those woods. Yet, like water between her fingers, the dream slipped away, leaving only the ache of wanting.

During breakfast, her mom spoke enthusiastically about a gathering she was heading to this morning with the aunties, and she invited Julie to tag along with them. She declined her mom's offer, explaining that she had already made plans to spend the day with Josh. Mary playfully nudged her daughter, insinuating that they might wind up becoming a thing. Julie laughed. Though Josh was good-looking, the idea of dating right now seemed ludicrous. Since the beginning of her studies, there was little time for much else. Period.

That afternoon, Josh and Julie took a leisurely stroll through the woods behind the house with coffees in hand. The sun glared in the clear November sky, casting a cool haze over everything. "So, how are ya today? Still hurtin?"

Instinctively, Julie touched her neck. "Well, the pills help a bit; it's not that bad now," she replied.

"Good." He kicked a stone out of the path and kept walking.

She continued, "I haven't slept too well the past couple of days, though."

"Really? Why's that?" He glanced at her briefly, then took a sip of coffee; steam rose, mingling with his breath.

"It's nothing major, really." She shrugged, then took a swig from her own cup; three-quarters of the way done, she could feel the effects of the caffeine already kicking in, giving her a much needed energy boost..

"Come on, just lay it out." He nudged her encouragingly.

They stopped at a large fallen tree and sat down in the middle. That's when Julie opened up about her dreams and the mysterious deerman. When she finished, she downed the rest of her coffee and gazed thoughtfully out at the trees. Half expecting and half hoping he'd provide some logical explanation.

Finally, after a moment or two, he spoke. "This man you're dreaming about reminds me of a story my grandpa Joe told me a few years back when we were out at his camp."

Julie's interest was suddenly piqued. "Oh yeah? I don't think I've heard it. How does it go?"

He shivered in his jacket. "Well, how about we head back, and I'll tell you on the way?"

She nodded, "Deal."

The Story of Waawaashkesh Nini (Deerman):

On a fall day back in the 70s, a chilling presence settled over the reserve. Word started spreading throughout the community: reports of an unusually large deer, unlike anything seen before. The first sighting happened in the woods just behind the apartment complex at the southern end of the community.

Hoofprints left behind, undeniably from an animal, like a deer or an elk, but much larger than that. The elders talked in quiet voices; their weathered faces etched with concern. A spirit animal, a visitor from the unknown.

Some villagers believed the deer was a kind of protector, while others viewed it as evidence of sorcery at play or a shapeshifter. Suspicion rippled through the tranquil reserve of what or who it could be.

One quiet evening, a young native woman named Lora stood outside her home wrapped in a wool blanket, as she so often did, to gaze up at the stars. Lately, a kind of loneliness had settled over her life.

At twenty-two, she lived alone in a house inherited from her late grandmother. Being adopted at the young age of three, she had no memories of her real birth family, and her shyness always made it difficult to get to know people. More than anything, she craved companionship and romance. Lora often wished for a handsome, tall man to come into her life and sweep her off her feet.

The following Saturday, after the sun sank over the horizon, Lora sat on the deck again with a cup of steeped tea, this time gazing at the distant glow of the local dancehall. She imagined people dancing there and having fun under the glowing lights and wondered what it must be like.

"If only someone would ask me to the dance," she whispered to the evening breeze, ignoring her late grandmother's wise counsel to always be careful what she wished for. Instead, whether or not she realized it, Lora sent her intent out into the void of all things. Her invitation beckoned to a place deep in the woods where the oldest things still lived. A shooting star trailed across the sky like a silver ribbon, and she felt a warm energy begin in the pit of her stomach. A familiar yearning emerged.

That evening, as she lay in bed staring at the tiled ceiling, images of couples dancing filled her mind. "…handsome man," she murmured before drifting into a restless sleep. The stillness of the night thickened with anticipation. An intrusive rapping on her door echoed through her dreams like thunder. Lora jerked awake. It was strange for anyone to visit this late, but out of curiosity, she pulled on her shawl, cautiously approached the door, and turned on a light.

As the door swung open, she gasped in surprise. Before her stood, undoubtedly, the most attractive man she'd ever laid eyes on, his skin a warm tan, his eyes gleaming like polished obsidian. An air of mystery surrounded him.

"Hey, I'm Devin," he said, a charming smirk playing on his lips. "I know it's *really* late, but I'm trying to get to a dance hall. Could I bother you for directions?" A crop of dark hair fell over his eyes as though it were deliberate, catching. The fading light.

Lora swooned slightly and wondered if this was all a dream. A handsome man shows up at her door late at night, asking for directions. A feeling of doubt niggled at the pit of her stomach.

She suddenly remembered stories her grandmother told of mysterious, handsome young men in black who were not really men at all, who would seduce women and take them, never to be seen again.   

"Uh, look, I'm not up for going anywhere tonight. ,"Sorry, I can't help you," Lora replied hesitantly and started closing the door. His gaze locked onto hers with a magnetic pull. He stepped closer, and a mysterious air of energy hung around him. "You should come to the dance with me, Lora. It'll be fun. Forget everything else." In that instant, the energy shifted, enveloping her in a heady aura of intoxicating and alluring magnetism. He was… irresistible. Lora felt her resolve melting away. "Okay… I'll go," she said, despite the smallest protest in the back of her mind. I'll get ready.

As they climbed into his shiny, black pickup truck and drove off, her mind was floating lost somewhere on the outer fringes of her consciousness, but she could still sense and feel things: the truck jolting along the dirt road, the smell of the vehicle's interior, and the warmth of a man's rough worn hand intermingled in hers. A single memory fragment floated past, and her mind latched on, holding fast. And then she remembered something. Devin. It's Devin, and then it all faded to black.

\---

As they arrived at the dance hall, her earlier memories had all but faded and been replaced by new ones: Devin knocked on the door, asking for directions. They hit it off, and then he graciously invited her to the dance, and she happily accepted.

The thrum of music pulsed from the speakers; under the warm lantern glow, the dance floor was alive with people adorned in cowboy hats and boots, moving and swaying with the music. Lora felt an overwhelming thrill in Devin's presence. Tonight, she felt like the prettiest woman in the room. As they moved across the dancefloor, all eyes drew to them. Women watched with envious sighs while men regarded Lora with looks of admiration.

Yet unease flickered to life within her as the night went on. She noticed Devin's eyes had changed–more comprehensively, with a new glint of darkness lurking in their depths. The atmosphere in the room shifted, but Lora tried to brush it all off as a side effect of the music. Still, an inexplicable tension now hung in the air; it was tangible enough that even the other dancers sensed something was off kilter.

As the music died, their dancing slowed to a stop. Devin leaned in close and whispered in her ear, "Midnight's almost here. Time for us to go." She broke free from his embrace and stepped back, confused. "What do you mean? She turned and glanced at the clock over her shoulder, both hands now pointed to Midnight.

"Oh, oh. Too late!" His tone dripped with amusement as he took a few steps back.

The crowd had now cleared a circle around them. In that instant, Devin's body contorted and shifted where a man once stood; a hideous creature now emerged. Antlers spawned grotesquely from his head, casting eerie shadows across the dance hall. His feet twisted into hooves and clattered noisily against the wooden floor as he took two steps towards Lora. Fear descended, replacing the buoyant atmosphere and sending ripples of horror through the crowd. Lora stumbled back in terror and awe.

The crowd erupted in utter panic. The frantic rush to get away turned the space into a scene of chaos. People stumbled into one another, sending fall harvest decorations and balloons twirling and swaying wildly in their mad rush to escape. Lora remained frozen, torn between fear and the haunting sense of connection she felt with this strange creature that now stood before her.

Devin looked around pleasantly, pleased, his arms raised to address an empty room. "Ah, good. Now that we're alone. We can talk."

"Wha… what?" she asked, her voice croaked. Then she cleared it and tried again, sounding steadier this time." What is it you want?"

"You've experienced the night's enchantment, but now I want something in return."

Panic rose in Lora as the weight of his words settled in. She dared to ask,

"What is it?"

"You." He mused. "I have travelled far and wide to find a woman like you who will balance me. Someone worthy," he said. "Come with me now. You will never be alone again."

A wave of dread washed over her at the thought of being tied to Devin, a sorcerer and shapeshifter. Trembling, she stepped back and shouted, "No!" struggling to stay calm. "I won't go with you!"

Devin's expression shifted from amusement to fury as the lights flickered. A hearty laugh reverberated off the walls of the dance hall.

"You dare refuse me, Lora? You'll face the consequences."

 

"No one will love you, Lora. You'll always be alone, just like you always have been."

 

Summoning all her courage, Lora declared, "If I'm going to love someone, then it should be of my own choosing, not anyone's or any *thing* else'*s*."

She turned on her heel and pushed through the hall doors, running out into the night. It no longer held any of its magic for her. Looming shadows seemed to stretch and stretch, morphing into eerie shapes. She could hear strange noises, rustling in the trees, and the familiar sound of hooves crunching on gravel from behind her, getting closer. Frightened, she ran on, never daring to look back.

Suddenly, to her great relief, a set of blurry car lights came into view half a mile down the road. Lora waved her hands frantically in the air until the vehicle slowed to a stop. Sweating and breathless, she stumbled over to the passenger side, glanced over her shoulder, and got in. As the car turned around, her eyes briefly scanned the road in the headlights, but thankfully, there was no sign of the creature anywhere.

 

After arriving home, she thanked the driver and got out. A wave of relief washed over her as she walked down the driveway. The familiar sight of the house, filled with precious memories of her grandmother, was a great comfort. Standing beneath the moon's glow, Lora realized, at that moment, that love wasn't merely something to wish for but a journey of self-discovery that she'd have to undertake to truly understand.

She began her first week of school at a nearby college a month later. The first bell buzzed as she slammed her locker shut. She rushed down the hall late for her first class, incidentally, colliding with another student exiting a room from the right. Books flew off in all directions.

"Oh, my god. I'm so sorry, "a young man, Lora's age, glanced down apologetically. Without looking, she quickly bent to retrieve the textbooks.

The young man squatted beside her, grabbed one, and handed it back. "Uh, here you go," he said nervously.

She looked down at the hand holding the book and raised her eyes to meet his. She noted their colour, sea green---her favourite color.

"Thanks," she replied shyly and took it.

"Um, I'm Stephen," he extended his right hand.

"Lora," she smiled.  

 \---

"The End." Josh paused to take a bow.

"Wow," Julie exclaimed. Clapping. "That is an amazing story!"

Josh grinned, "yeah, Gramps always was a skilled storyteller."

Julie nodded thoughtfully. "The story… it's not real, though, is it?"

According to Gramps, it happened back in the 70s; the girl Lora supposedly died in a car accident two years after it happened; it was long before we were born. In fact, you are living two houses away from where she did, Josh said matter-of-factly. He stopped and turned to face her; his expression was quizzical. "You really never knew?"

Julie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Uh, no," she replied, her voice inflecting slightly, "I had no idea. And the name Lora. That's the name I heard in my dream."

"Yeah, I know," Josh said and grew silent. They continued walking, each lost in their own quiet reflection.

Josh stopped dead in his tracks twenty meters from the woods' edge. His eyes riveted to the ground; with a murmured exclamation, he sank into a crouch.

"Why did you stop?" Julie asked, coming to stand beside him. Josh hadn't replied, his attention focused on the ground. She traced his gaze to where he'd cleared away some leaves, revealing large hoofprints.

"Oh, my goodness." Julie followed his lead and hunkered down to study the outline of the prints more closely. She splayed her hand over it; it was almost a perfect fit. Slowly, their eyes met, then turned to look at the house. Together, they brushed some more twigs and dried leaves out of the way, searching for more evidence of prints, but found none.

"How can that be?" Josh asked, dumbfounded. They both exchanged bewildered glances.

Julie shook her head. "That's so weird."

"Julie, " her mother called out to her, carrying an arm full of groceries in from the car. They both rose to their feet and walked back in silence.

Later that evening, **Josh texted:** Hey, my grandfather is back home from out west. You should come out for a visit. He brought back some homemade elk jerky! ;)

Julie knew that Josh's grandpa was a respected elder in the community.

It had been a long time since she'd sat with an elder. Amidst the growing peculiarities in her life lately, now was probably a good time as any to seek wisdom again.

**She texted back:** Okay, I'll be there soon.

With a trade blanket and some tobacco, Julie snuck out quietly and set off down the highway in her mother's car to Josh's grandfather's place on Mukwa Road. Just past Miigwan's craft shop, the darkness suddenly thickened with unexpected fog. It seemed surreal to see fog in mid-November, but climate change was worsening. Julie slowed her speed, moving cautiously through the formless shapes in the mist. Until one shape appeared to become more solid and took the familiar form of a man. He stood off to the side of the road and waved his hand to get her attention. Despite her initial wariness, she pulled over and rolled down the passenger window. He seemed non-threatening and claimed to be headed in the same direction. Acting against her better judgment, perhaps because of sympathy, she offered him a lift.  

Julie dared a quick glance at him, her eyes refocused back on the road. There was something vaguely familiar about the guy, though she was sure she'd never seen him before. He looked young, about her age. Even with his mussed hair partially swept over his eyes, she could tell he was a handsome Nish, mysterious, and kind of sexy; her mind wandered, entertaining thoughts she hadn't had since school began. "So, uh, what's your name?" she asked, trying to keep her mind from lingering in places it probably shouldn't be.

His voice then dropped to a mumble; words indistinguishable as his hands moved as though they were signing in a type of unknown language. A wave of dizziness swept over Julie, and her skin became flushed.

They came to a fork in the road. "Turn left here," he gestured toward a deserted dirt road opposite her turnoff. Though it was out of her way, she did as she was told, an inexplicable pull guiding her hands on the wheel.

"Stop here," he commanded. Julie pulled off to the side of the deserted road. It was pitch black out, and no other vehicles were in sight. Unable to move, Julie could only wait for whatever dark fate awaited her. From her peripheral vision, the man beside her appeared to be nothing more than a blurry shape in dark clothing, his face obscured by the shadows.

In the eerie silence that hung there between them, her phone rang, the high, shrill buzz temporarily breaking the spell of enchantment. She seized the moment to escape and flung open the car door and ran for the trees, her feet splashing through a partially frozen puddle. The cold water prickled at her damp feet, but she didn't care.

"Lora," He called out behind her. You can run but won't get away from me this time."

Thin branches whipped at her face, stinging the newly healed cuts on her cheeks as she rushed further into the trees; the frozen earth crunched beneath her feet. Darkness engulfed her. She tripped on a loose deadwood in the path and fell to the ground with a thud. The earth felt cold and rough beneath her. Quickly, she struggled to her feet, leaning against an old oak for support. Its cold, twisted bark pressed to her back as she struggled to ascertain her thoughts. Why did he call her Lora? Was there any truth to this? Doubt crept into her thoughts. Or was this all an illusion? A cruel sorcerer's trick.

"Lora, there's no use hiding." He called out.

With each step into the woods, the man's body shifts and contorts. His limbs lengthen, his torso narrowing as he takes on the tall, muscled form of a deerman. His transformation into a half-man, half-deer creature is a blend of flesh and wilderness magic. Branches cracked beneath the weight of his hooves as he came to stand in an open space 15 meters away from where Julie hid. Steam snorted through his nostrils as he turned his head, sniffed the air, and  disappeared into the foliage.

She clung to the tree, desperate to keep from sight. Her heart pounded furiously, threatening to burst from her chest.

Three miles down the road, in a rustic log cabin beneath a tin roof, an elderly man sat before an open altar of sacred items; he picked up the turtle shell rattle handed down through generations and grasped it in his weathered hand. The rattle shakes, and he chants in a low, raspy voice, singing from his heart centre, imploring the ancestors to help shield Julie. The potent medicine from the rattle swirls about the cabin and goes forth into the night. In the meantime, Josh had already bolted from the cabin in search of Julie, racing against time to find her before it was too late.

Julie trembled behind the tree; the cold pricked at her toes like sewing needles and stung her blood-stained cheeks, but she dared not move a muscle until it was gone. After a few moments of unsettling silence, she mustered up enough courage to peer out, her eyes strained to see into the trees. When there was no sign of the creature, she made her way out into the open, cautiously looking around so more for fear that it might come back.

Josh peered over the dash in the headlights, looking for any sign of Julie. He spotted a car ahead parked off the roadside, the driver's door ajar. He immediately got out and grabbed his rifle and a flashlight, then ran after the footprints leading into the forest.

Twigs snapped and rustled behind Julie. Her heart leaped as she realized she wasn't alone. Slowly turning, her gaze met two glowing yellow eyes, like separate entities, hovering five feet above her. For the first time, she witnessed the thing chasing her. It was a partial man's body with the head of a deer, complete with gnarled antlers that twisted upward, grotesque and misshapen. His arms were sparsely covered in deer fur and had become more elongated. Looking down, she saw Hooven feet. Julie then screamed in sheer terror at the monstrous being that stood before her in all its horrifying glory. She thoroughly believed that the devil had come to steal her soul.

Joe sang with even greater intensity, his eyes still closed. He shook the rattle vigorously, its high-energy vibrations piercing the ether. Powerful chanting carried through the night to encircle the creature. The spiritual assault had begun; it stumbled back, shaking its enormous head in blind confusion and fury; antlers broke the nearby branches. Josh broke into the clearing, calling Julie in earnest. He spotted her a few feet away from the beast and raised his shotgun, firing a single shot at the creature, grazing its arm. The sound echoed through the night; the monster stumbled back, shrieking in pain. Josh ran to Julie. Dropping the shotgun, he grabbed her in his arms, shielding her.

The aura around the creature shivered and vibrated with preternatural intensity; suddenly, it let out a chilling scream–a horrifying cross between a man's cry and a deer's wail. Julie and Josh clamped their hands over their ears, recoiling from the sound. Then, in frantic desperation, accepting defeat, it bolted, crashing through the underbrush with mad abandon. The Deerman tore through the woods, driven by a primal urge to escape.

Julie collapsed in Josh's arms, and he held her close, rubbing her back with reassurance, "it's over now, Julie, he said reassuringly, "It's over."

"Not this time, Waawasshkesh Nini, not this time," Grandpa Joe spoke, seeing that Julie and Josh were together and safe; he lowered his rattle, his face shining from perspiration. He nodded. It is done.
