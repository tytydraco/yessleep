It was a dark and stormy night, the kind that sends shivers down your spine and makes you question every decision you've ever made. But for Jack, it was just another night at the bar, drowning his sorrows in whiskey and wondering how he had ended up alone.

As he stumbled out of the bar, the rain pelted him relentlessly, soaking through his clothes and chilling him to the bone. He didn't have a car, so he stumbled through the streets, trying to find his way home.

But as he turned down a dark alley, he felt a sense of unease wash over him. Something wasn't right. He tried to quicken his pace, but his legs felt heavy, like they were made of lead.

And that's when he saw it. A figure in the shadows, watching him with glowing eyes. Jack tried to turn and run, but his feet wouldn't obey him. The figure stepped out of the shadows, revealing itself to be a monstrous creature, its fangs gleaming in the dim light.

Jack tried to scream, but the sound died in his throat as the creature lunged at him, sinking its teeth into his neck. The pain was excruciating, and Jack knew that he was going to die.

But instead of slipping peacefully into the afterlife, Jack found himself transformed. He was no longer human, but something else entirely. Something dark and twisted and hungry.

He spent the next few weeks wandering the streets, searching for prey. He couldn't help himself. The hunger consumed him, driving him to kill again and again.

But even as he fed, he felt a sense of unease growing within him. He knew that what he was doing was wrong, that he was a monster. But he couldn't stop himself.

And that's when he met her. Emily. She was different from the others. She didn't scream or beg for mercy. Instead, she looked at him with pity in her eyes, as if she could see the tortured soul beneath the monster.

For the first time in weeks, Jack felt something other than hunger. He felt a spark of hope. Maybe he could change. Maybe he could be redeemed.

But it was too late. The hunger had consumed him, and there was no going back. He killed Emily, just like he had killed the others .

And as he stood over her lifeless body, he felt a sense of emptiness wash over him. He was alone once again, but this time, it was his own doing. He was a monster, and there was no escaping it.

So he wandered the streets, feeding on the innocent, until one day, he met another like him. Another monster. And together, they roamed the city, hunting and killing, until there was no one left.

And as they stood atop a mountain of corpses, bathed in blood and gore, Jack knew that he had finally found his true calling. He was a monster, and he was damn good at it .
