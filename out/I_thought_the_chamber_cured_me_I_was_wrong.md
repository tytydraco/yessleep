“Because it will help.”

That’s all I was told about the treatment when I asked why the doctors were recommending sensory deprivation. Here’s the thing, I have what some might call an overactive mind. Not an internal monologue, nor the occasional conversation with myself. No, when I say overactive, I mean extremely fucking overactive.

At any given time, I can hear at least twenty voices calling my name. I fight with them; I argue and beg for silence, even if only for a moment. But no matter how much I plead, the chorus never stops. I couldn’t take it anymore, and that’s how I ended up here.

They explained the procedure as we walked, but I couldn’t make out everything they said, so I just followed. We went down the hall, passing a sign for the Behavioral Therapeutics Wing. Then, as we passed through a pair of sliding glass doors, I saw it for the first time.

The chamber.

It looked like what a child might imagine a teleportation chamber to be. In a way, this was exactly that. But instead of being transported to faraway lands, I was being taken to a place where only I would exist. The doctor pressed a button on his keypad and the door hissed open, splitting the contraption in half. I looked inside at the still water, so clear that even a mirror would be hard-pressed to give a better reflection.

They had me change into a textureless, all-white bathing suit that fit me snugly. Then, they blinded me with glasses darker than the night. I listened for the doctor’s voice as I climbed into the water. It was hard to hear him among the noise, but I did eventually single his voice out. “Remember, if you get scared, ground yourself.” He went on, “Lift your fingers and feel the water dripping from them, and just breathe.”

I took three deep breaths as the door closed.

At first, nothing happened. The voices inside my head screamed about how stupid I was for even considering this. I lay back on the water, weightless, floating in an endless sea. Then something started to happen. The voices changed. They no longer jested and ranted but started begging. They screamed out in pain as if they’d been set alight. And one by one, they fell silent. I heard the final voice—the worst one by far—call out as it too faded away.

“You’ll pay for this.”

Then there was nothing.

For the first time in my life, there was peace and silence. I could have cried I was so happy. I stayed there, floating and feeling the drips fall from my fingers as I lifted them from the water’s surface.

I smiled and counted the seconds, then the minutes, then the hours.

Something was wrong. It had to be. Why would they leave me like this for so long? I imagined things, the doctor dead on the floor outside the chamber. The nurses laughing as they bet each other how long I could last before the pressure broke me. I started hyperventilating, choking on my own breath.

“Please,” I called out. “Please, let me out.”

There was no response.

I pulled the glasses off my eyes, and the plugs from my ears and screamed. “Please!”

A moment before my heart was about to rupture, the door hissed open. At first I felt instant relief, but then my skin went cold. Standing above the open chamber was a man I’d never seen before. He was shrouded in darkness, with slits where his eyes should have been. His jaw cracked as it opened.

“I said you’d pay for this.”

Then, everything happened at once. My heart lurched into my throat as the man screamed and leaped into the tank. He grabbed me by the neck and started squeezing the life out of me. I couldn’t breathe. A smile stretched across his shadowy face as my vision faded. I managed to choke a single word out before my world went dark.

“Please.”

I awoke sometime later to a hissing sound and a commotion as doctors and nurses pulled me from the chamber.

“He's still choking himself,” they said.

 “Can you hear me?”

I pretended I couldn’t hear them. And then, somehow, I was outside, running, though I don't remember how.

And now I’m here, writing this story for you, a set of eyes that I’m not even sure will ever read this. And why is that, you may ask?

Because every time I lift my hands from the keys, I can still feel the water dripping from my fingers.
