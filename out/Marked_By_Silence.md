From dusk to dawn, a hush reigned in the small, fog-enshrouded town of Widow's Peak. By 8 p.m., every door was locked and every window sealed tightâ€”yet not a sound would break until morning. There was never any talk of why. That was just the way things were.

I could not stand the suspense. Mother used to catch me peeping out into twilight time, through the curtains.

As night turned the sky a deep, purple red, I had to find out the truth. That evening, as my mother went to bed, I snuck out of the house.

The streets were deserted, and the quietness pressed down upon my ears. I passed through the cobblestone without a sound. As though pointing out to me the other end of town and where the old abandoned church laid, the fog.

My breath hitched as I approached the building; its doors that had once been grand now hung loosely on rusted hinges. I pushed one open and crept inside, the air filled with the scent of dust and decay; I could see a faint glow coming from the basement.

I crept, tiptoeing down the thin staircase, as if pulled by the light at the end of it. I came into a massive underground chamber; its center was taken up by the ancient stone altar, covered in rows of flickering candles, upon which were placed thirteen human skulls, they, along with those of the town elders, hidden under pitch black hoods.

They were chanting, their language unintelligible to me; their voices soft and repetitive. Lying upon the altar was an ancient book, the pages contained within it yellow with age and heavily frayed. As I watched, the head elder lifted his hands, and a dark mist began curling up from the book toward them.

I gasped, and the sound echoed in the chamber. The elders turned toward me, their eyes glowing a sinister red. I turned to run, my heart racing, but the mist caught me up. It wrapped around me, filling my lungs with darkness.

I awoke in bed to the morning sun shining through the window. Was everything a dream? I felt this terrible pain in my chest and looked down to see the thin scar. My mother entered the room, looking worried.

"You were out of bed last night," she said softly. "You must never do that again."

I nodded, but inside my curiosity had been kindled even fiercer. I had seen and it was real.

Days turned into weeks, and I found myself undergoing a change. I could hear whispers in the silence and see shadows moving at the corner of my eyes. I became aware that darkness had engraved its mark upon my life and that now I was a part of the secret. One evening, as the sun set, my mother took me aside. "It is time you knew the truth," she said, her voice shaking. "The silence keeps them away, the ones that hunt in the night. But now they are bound to you."

My mother's words marked hard, and I looked up at her. I was not just marked; I was targeted. The silence was a barrier, the town, and I was the crack.

That night, as the townspeople locked their doors and shut their windows, I stood in my room, the scar on my chest throbbing. I knew the truth. I had been made a vessel. As the eight-hour bell began to chime, I felt an irresistible urge to leave the house. I tried to resist but found my body moving of its own accord. I strode into the fog with the red glow of my eyes reflected in the mist. The silence of Widow's Peak was shattered as the creatures of the night, now freed, started their reign of terror. And in the darkness, I smiled.
