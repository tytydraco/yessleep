I’ve been told to post here because you guys are good with relationship advice. Not long ago, I moved in with my fiancé in the countryside around Siem Reap, and I have been lying to her ever since.

A few of the first things anyone will notice when they move here is that tradition is deeply ingrained, and spirituality is a part of daily life. Especially amongst the older generations, any talk of gods, spirits, or demons is not fantasy or metaphor, it’s very real and very literal. I’ve come to understand why.

Since moving here, I’ve spent the majority of my free time with my fiancé and her family—at least I did at first. They live near the capital of Siem Reap at the base of Kulen Mountain. They’re not originally from that area, they’re from the top of the mountain, but had been pushed out by the Khmer Rouge. Kulen Mountain is the site of the first major city of the Khmer Empire, and later was one of the last strongholds of the Khmer Rouge. It’s peppered with thousand-year-old ruins, stunning waterfalls, and forests bursting at the seams with fresh, natural fruit that have no English names I know of. 

My fiancé’s family is incredible and I have a deep respect for them. They’re overwhelmingly kind and welcoming, and they’ve overcome severe hardship. Her father fought in the civil war. Who he fought for is a question you simply don’t ask. The only issue is that they speak no English, and I—embarrassingly—speak no Khmer. Spending time with them is always a warm experience, but after several hours of eavesdropping on conversations I don’t understand, I can get a bit antsy.

A few weeks ago, I told my fiancé that I was going to go walk around the neighborhood and have a smoke. I walked down the red soil streets for some time listening to David Bowie, occasionally stepping aside for a truck or a pack of buffalo. I reached a stretch of road void of houses and smothered with trees and vegetation. A woman stepped out from the dense thicket. I stopped, taken off guard by her sudden appearance. As I looked at her, I was put at ease. She had a gentle face with well-groomed hair and an impressive sampot. She was most likely a local woman picking fruit—at the very least, she was sane enough to keep her hair straight and clothes clean in a crowded, dusty jungle. I began to walk but I stopped again as I was overcome with a bizarre sensation. I had the impression that the woman came and took me by the hand. She hadn’t moved, and yet I had the perfect memory of her approaching me, her glistening eyes smiling into mine, her soft hands gripping my wrist. I gave into the urge to follow her, ignoring the inconsistencies between my memory and obvious reality.

She led me back off the road and into the jungle. She stopped at the base of a tree and stretched her arm up, picking off a small bunch of lychee. She took one and began to peel it, handing the rest to me. I picked off a lychee of my own, but when I looked back at her, I was face to face with something else. 

Loose, gray skin hanged off of a vaguely female figure, at least 8 feet tall. Its fingers stretched an unnatural length from its hands and curved back until they were nearly parallel with its arms. It bent down and put its face directly into mine, seeming to revel in the shock of my reaction. Its cheeks were bony and hollow, while loose skin hanging off its chin like bedsheets. As it lacked lips, its teeth were clearly visible—crooked and inconsistent like a mouth full of broken glass. Its eyes were nothing but pits with raw, almost scab-like skin at the bottom of each pit. A tall, elaborate, golden crown sat at the top of its head, with the metal appearing to penetrate the skin at the top of its head. It shrieked at an unbelievable, ear-splitting level, and I instantly fell back in surprise. The jungle had become dark, and the air thick and opaque. Without missing a beat, the thing arched over me. It continued to howl while it waved its bent hands in front of me. As it did, the color of its clothes and the glow of its crown seemed to almost float. Its movements flowed into each other like ocean waves. As her arms drifted around me, echoes of her movements trailed behind, as if she had thousands of arms—each one mimicking and following behind the one in front of it.

As she did, my mind was filled with vivid images of my death. Every conceivable way in explicit and agonizing detail. A rope rapidly tightening around my neck as my body drops from a gallows. The snap of my spine as I hit the bottom, and the bulging of my eyes and tongue as I’m left to rot. Sitting alone when an intense pressure crushes my chest as my heart stops. The serrations of a knife puncturing my jugular and the blade slashing across my throat, and the blood rushing and foaming from the wound. But somehow, despite these visions, I was filled with an indescribable bliss. Between flashes, I could see that figures had appeared in the distance, hiding between the trees and watching us.

Eventually it let me go and I stumbled out of the forest, my head buzzing like a strange hangover. I made my way back to my fiancé and her family, buying a large sack of jujubes on the way. When she asked where I had been, I told her I wasted a lot of time looking for a place to buy the jujubes. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t let her know about what happened. She laughed at me, since jujubes are sold everywhere. That night, we slept in separate beds to not upset her parents. They fell asleep early, but I sat awake, thinking about that horrible thing and the incredible feeling it gave me.

I snuck out that night and went to the same spot in the forest. I approached the same tree and reached up for lychee, but my arm was grabbed by the things long, gray fingers. It did the same thing, and once again, my mind was showered with nirvana and scenes of my death. I snuck back home, and of course said nothing of it to my fiancé the following morning.

Over the next few weeks, I started going more and more frequently. I’ve been telling my fiancé that work has been hectic and I’ve needed to work overtime. She’s very perceptive, and I don’t think I can keep this up without her soon realizing that I’m lying. Not long ago, I attempted to go a full day without visiting that thing, but after only a few hours, my arms began to shake and twitch, and an oppressive nausea filled my stomach and bulged against my throat. After going to the forest, the sickness was eased. The only thing that I’ve noticed is that, every time I go, more spectators seem to appear in the surrounding forest.

I’m hoping someone can give me advice on what to do or how to work this out with my fiancé. If possible, I would prefer that she never knows the details of what I’ve been doing.
