“Hi. I happen to be busy right now, leave me a message, thanks.” Ryan’s voicemail message played over and over again as I rang him repeatedly. I sat on the edge of my bed, phone in hand barely able to see the screen through my watery eyes. I told myself it was in case he’d pick up, but really I just wanted to hear his voice which was so cheerful and sweet.

“This is Sam. Don’t leave me a message I won’t reply.” My sister’s voice came next. 

“You have reached big donny Logan, just send me a text? Why are you phoning me anyway? Bye!” Logan voicemail rang. I had them on a rotation. 



The house was so quiet without my mum and brothers. Mum had taken them to stay with my nan. I volunteered to stay behind so I could keep going to work and watch over the house. Although I was lonely, it was nice to be alone. I could grieve in peace. Also, I felt I deserved the isolation. As somehow, clearly, I had drawn some people to me that wanted nothing more than to hurt people close to me. I just wish I knew why and then I could try to stop it. 



As I sat on the edge of my bed, weeping pitifully, I heard the post flap open. The sound made me jump and I dropped my phone. I was so paranoid every noise made me jump out of my skin.

“Heellloooo. Christopher! It’s Nyx. I changed my name. Jasper didn’t suit me!” Nyx, previously known as Jasper, shouted through my post flap. 



Rolling my eyes, I reluctantly got up from my bed and thudded down the stairs. I opened the door to Nyx. She stood waiting in my doorway in her school uniform, on hand hooked around her back pack strap. Her polyester blazer was decorated with an excessive amount of badges. My favourite was a prefect badge where she had scratched out the r and moved it in front of the e so it spelled “perfect”. It was also clear that she’d coloured in pieces of her school’s embroidered logo, which was meant to be the Virgin Mary. In her place was a goth girl with a nose piercing. 



“...Hi.” I greeted her, confused as to why she was standing at my door. I was also curious as to how she’d found my address. “Hi. I’ve been doing some research.” She said, looking up at me. 

“...Uh huh.”

“Can I come in?” She asked. “No. But if you give me five minutes to put my shoes on we can go for a walk. Alright?”

“Okay.” She smiled. “We could go on the pier, it’s only down the road.”



I nodded in agreement and started looking around for my shoes. I left the door open as I pulled them on and threw on a jacket. Nyx looked around the inside of my house curiously as if she was looking for something. 

“Are those your mum’s parents Ron and Samantha?” She asked, pointing at the framed picture at the bottom of the stairs. 

“Y’know kid,” I began as I walked out of my house and closed the front door behind me. “People find it rude if you research their family history without their permission.”

“It’s all public information. If they don’t want me to see something they should make better choices with their information.” She told me as we started walking. It took my eyes a little while to adjust to the afternoon sun as I hadn’t been outside in the daylight in at least a week.

“Yeah. I wanted to ask how do you know where I live and who my grandparents are.”

“Well I found your address on the voting register and I found your family history on a website that has all the countries births, deaths and marriages recorded from like the 1700’s up to the 90’s for free.” 

“I thought that stuff was hidden behind pay walls.”

“Not for smart people.” She grinned. 

“Mhm. So what research have you been doing?” “Well clearly there’s something about you that’s attracting vampires. And clearly they want your family and they’re leaving these clues. So I started with the mistletoe.” She zipped open her back pack and pulled out a scrap book. She opened the book to a page with one of the mistletoe business cards. Around it were notes and more drawn or stuck in pictures. 

“And what have you learnt?” 

“Well it’s a parasitic mistletoe. And the emblem belongs to the De Bourbon family and their enterprises. It’s trademarked and everything. But! They stole it.” 

“Did they now?” “Yes! From you. Christopher. W. Smith. W for Whittaker!” She poked me in the arm with each word.

I smiled, amused at her storytelling skills. 

“From me?” I asked, not recalling ever having a family emblem stolen from me. “Yes.” She put the scrap book back into her bag and then pulled another big book. She opened it to a page of text so dense that it made my eyes hurt to look at. 

“Lets sit down first and then you can read to me.”

“Alright then.” 



We walked the length of the pier, passed the old men fishing and the swarming seagulls, until we found a nice spot to sit down and gaze at the Thames. 

“Ahem.” She placed the big book on her lap and sat up straight ready to read. “In the years after the fall of the ancien regime the few French aristocrats that survived the terror fled across Europe and even sometimes further.” She began, relishing each word. “Few managed to attain the wealth they once had with many of their descendants falling into poverty throughout the 19th century.”

“Can we hurry along to the important bit please?”

“I’m getting there! Don’t interrupt. As I was saying…However, there were some notable cases of aristocrats being able to marry into new money. Particularly in America and Britain where the industrial revolution was bringing in money to the growing middle and upper middle class. Many families involved in industry became richer than the aristocracy. They were unaffectionally dubbed ‘new money’ or nouveau riche by the upper class. There are many examples of old bankrupt European aristocrats marrying into new money, such as…drumroll please.”I drum rolled my hands on the bench beneath us. 

“Catherine De Bourbon who married Joshua Whittaker the industry tycoon in 1810.” 

“Oh Cool.”  
  


She showed me a portrait of a beautiful woman in regency era clothing standing with the Whittaker family. Her husband, my supposed ancestor, was a fairly generic looking man, who may well have been related to me. They seemed to have five children but none of them took after her very much. I wasn’t sure whether vampires could have children. 

“Well?” Nyx goaded excitedly. “Well what?”

“Look in the background.” She tapped the page. 

I scanned the rest of the painting when my eyes focused on a particular face. The butler’s face. He was tall, devilishly handsome and had a black ponytail. It was the man who’d stamped my hand. 



“So, what are you saying?” I asked as I took the book into my own hands, staring at the picture in disbelief. “I’m saying you have some sort of connection to Catherine De Bourbon and for some reason she wants you. I wonder if your family just makes good vampires and she’s looking for you to join her entourage.” 

“Do you reckon she’s like my great great nan or something?”

“No. Those are her step children and they all died before they had their own. I don’t believe vampires can have children. Seeing as their bodies are dead. But clearly there’s a connection there.” 

“Why not just steal me first? Why go after my family?”

“I don’t know. I don’t know everything y’know.”

“Sorry it just seems like you do sometimes. Any idea where Cathy is these days?”

“No. She switches up her identity every thirty or so years, usually posing as her own niece, or distant cousin showing up to inherit whatever she’s built. But I’ll keep an eye out. She’ll be doing something that either gets her power or money. And she loves using your old family emblem. I think she likes the symbolism of the plant.” 

“Would she maybe be an MP or a business owner?” I wondered. 

“Yes. She’d been both of those things. But I’ve already searched her up on LinkedIn and I didn't see anything aside from deleted accounts. She might be in the process of switching up her identity.” 

“And you haven’t found anything about the mistletoe logo? No companies using it?”

“Unfortunately not, but I was going to look into that tonight. Because she changes it a little bit every time.”

“You might not need to. I swear I know it from somewhere but it’s not quite the same…oh dam what is it…” I took my phone out of my pocket ready to search something up. I turned my phone over in my hand trying to remember what I wanted to search for. I switched it on and I saw exactly what I was thinking of. Chatterbox. The social media app. It has a logo which I always thought was meant to mimic a LAN with wires going to points. But as I looked at it more carefully I saw it was the same pattern as the mistletoe but flipped upside down. And of course instead of green stems and white berries it was connecting wires and nodes.  



Nyx, who was peeking over my shoulder, clapped her hands together excitedly. 

“How did we not see it?!” She exclaimed loudly. “Who’s the CEO?” Nyx tapped out the search into her search engine and we both laughed at each other in disbelief. The CEO of Chatterbox is the beautiful prolific business woman and tech mogul; Catie Brown. Who bears a striking resemblance to Lady Catherine De Bourbon. 



“We make such a good team!” Nyx said. Her volume was still inappropriately loud, she shocked a couple of seagulls with her excited shout. “So what do we do now? Go to London? Find her lair? Do you know any explosives experts from uni?”

I laughed. “That’s not how it works kid.”

“So what are we going to do?” She asked, looking up at me with hopeful eyes, acne littering her cheekbones. I wanted to say “I don’t know.” But I came to a realization at that moment. 



A strange change takes place in your twenties where children, the group you belonged to for about eighteen years and now suddenly you aren’t a part of anymore, turn to you for answers. You can’t say you don’t know and you can’t turn away from their questions. You have to ask yourself, what are we going to do?



“Well-” I started, having no idea what was about to come out of my mouth. Nyx opened up a clear page of her scrap book and waited for my instructions. I tried to think about what Ryan would say. “I think we should probably find out where she lives. Or where her offices are. And then we can start thinking about where she has my family. Then we can go from there.” 



I did it. I actually came up with an idea and it was fairly sensible at that. Nyx noted down my every word then began to speak. 

“I think we should start with a weak link, someone small. And then we work our way up.”

“Will we need to?”

“Well if we just march right into her office I don’t think it will go down well. But if we slowly take people down-”

“Take people down?”

“Yeah they’re vampires, they kill people, so we need to kill them to stop them hurting others.” She explained. “That’s not our responsibility. We just need to get my family.”

“Alright then.” She looked deeply disappointed that we weren’t going to act out a full ‘follow the money’ style shake down of a criminal syndicate.  

“Listen I’ve got to get to work in about an hour and I assume your mum wants you home, it is a school night?” Nyx scoffed. “That bint couldn’t care less where I am.”  
  


I stood up and beckoned for her to follow me. “Come on, it’s almost dinner time. Do you know what your mum’s doing for dinner tonight?”

“Fish finger sandwich probably.”

“Hm. Do you want some chicken or something?” 

“Yes!”

“Consider it payment for your research.”

 

Before going to work, I sent Nyx home with a box of chicken and chips from the local takeaway and the research task of looking into how to defend yourself against vampires.



My late night closing shift at the warehouse passed as usual. I won’t say who I work for but they’re a large company that sells pretty much anything you can legally sell online. The conditions aren't great and neither is the pay, but I like my colleagues. They’ve been super supportive about what's been happening with my family, covering my shifts and such. We’re currently short staffed as well which makes me all the more grateful. 



We closed up at midnight. My colleagues all eagerly watched the clock and checked their phones waiting for the time to pass so they could go home. Personally, I dread work ending. The monotony of my work takes my mind off of all the bullshit that’s been going down recently. Reluctantly, I said goodnight to my work friends and the cleaners that show up when we’re done. Then I pulled on my jacket and headed out into the cool night for a quiet skate home. 



I skate boarded along the main road where cars and lorries were still going by. Their headlights dazzled me as they passed. I saw a bill board across the road for Chatterbox. Catherine De Bourbon’s sinisterly beautiful face stared at me as I went by. 

“Connect today! Create your Chatterbox account for free!” The speech bubble next to her name said. 

What I wanted to know was why her vampires were in my area anyway? Did they start out looking for me and just run into Logan and Maisie? What about my shithole of a town would attract a vampire? If I was a rich vampire I’d just get a regular blood donation and just pretend it was a health or weight loss technique. Although I had to note, I hadn’t seen Catherine herself here. Just the pony tail guy, whose name I still didn’t know and his comrades that had stalked me. I decided I’d just call him “The butler” for now. 



As I passed the bus stop a young woman with short bobbed blonde wavy hair watched me go by. I slowed down because I thought I recognised her. She smiled at me and somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had seen that smile before. She was wearing a smart wool blazer and a pencil skirt, which meant she looked very out of character in my land of hoodies and track suit bottoms. 

“Excuse me.” She got up and walked up to me, her voice was sweet and her accent definitely not local. It was an incredibly posh and delicate tone. Her kitten keels clopped along the concrete as she approached me. “Are you walking towards Church street?” She asked politely. I thought there was a touch of something European about her accent but it wasn’t very strong and I couldn’t place where it came from. 

“Yeah why?” I picked up my skateboard from the floor and tucked it under my arm. “Could I walk with you? I’ve been waiting for the bus for an hour and I really don’t want to walk through a dodgy area alone.” She explained. 

“Of course. But I have to ask, what are you doing in this area?” I asked her as we started walking towards Church Street. 

“I’m an assistant to your local MP Sebastian Forsythe.” That explained the dowdy outfit. And now I knew where I’d seen her. I knew it was something political. The honourable MP Seb Forsythe was a horrible and greedy little balding man who loved nothing more than to rant about immigrants and touch up his new assistants. I felt a bit sorry for the blonde woman even if she was happy to announce her association with such a man. 

“Oh. Can’t say I’m a fan.”

“Why not?” I laughed in disbelief. “Because he’s a massive racist.”

“How so?”

“Well he- He- Listen do you want me to just get you an uber? I’m not in the mood for a political debate.” 



The woman gave a wittering laugh. I thought she’d blow up at me in anger, call me woke or gay or something. But no, she just kept walking alongside me. I think she relished in my discomfort and liked that she’s gotten under my skin. 

“Let’s talk about something other than politics.” She said as we turned a corner. “What do you do for work?” She asked me. “I work in a warehouse.”

“Oh.” I could hear the judgement in her tone. 

“Mhm.”

“I believe there’s a short cut down there.” She pointed toward Mill Towers. 

“Yeah but I’d rather not walk through them at this time of night.”

“Suit yourself. I wish to get home quickly.”



Casually, she began walking through the dark alleyways of Mill Towers. Fascist or not, I couldn’t let her walk alone so I went after her. Realistically, we’d be fine. But I never liked to tempt fate. 

“Are you Hibernian by any chance?” She asked coldly, turning to look at me. 

“Huh!?” The word sounded offensive but I had no idea why. 

“Irish.”

“No idea. Why?”

“You just look like might be.” 

“Bit of an odd thing to say.” I remarked. Something made me incredibly uncomfortable about the woman but it was so hard to explain exactly what. She gave me a gut feeling. A heavy uneasy feeling and it was worse when I was close to her. 



As we turned into a quiet dark alley, she stopped right in front of me and looked me up and down again. There was a look in her that made me wonder if she was about to try to kiss me. She looked hungry. I looked away awkwardly, staring down at my trainers and got ready to give her the “Sorry lady I’m homosexual” conversation. But when I looked back up at her, her canines had grown several inches and she looked ready to eat me. She was drooling as she took a step towards me. 



I found that although I wanted to move, I couldn’t. It wasn’t fear that stuck me to the floor this time, it was something else. The woman kept her icy blue eyes fixed on mine. I felt dizzy and not in control of myself. I dropped my skateboard and it clattered onto the floor beneath me. My feet began to move without my permission toward the blonde and her drooling monstrous mouth. I felt floaty and light as if the weight of my body was being held up by something or someone else. 



Suddenly, the blonde woman gave an animalistic screech of pain. I was snapped out of daze and stumbled from the dizziness. I picked up my skateboard again and tried to get a look at what had injured the blonde. 

“Leave him alone. Foul demonic wench!” Nyx’s voice shouted in the darkness. There was another scream of pain. Nyx had a Turkish evil eye pendant which she was forcing into the woman's exposed bare skin. The flesh sizzled as if it were on fire and began to slip from her leg. 

“Run Chris!” Nyx yelled, darting off down the alleyway. I did as was told and once again followed Nyx away from danger. 



The blonde woman didn’t follow us. In fact I heard her kitten heels clop frantically in the other direction. We ran into Nyx’s tower block and found a window on one of the upper floors. Breathless, we watched the blonde run back to the bus stop. She hopped on the first bus out of town. So much for going to church street. Lying bitch. 



“You fell for the oldest trick in the book.” Nyx punched me in the arm. “And you don’t even like women, how did she get you?” “Well she told me she needed someone to walk her home. What were you doing out so late?” 

“Couldn’t sleep. I was staring out the window and I saw you walking with some blonde lady and I was intrigued.”

“Nosy. Also, evil eye? Is that something you found out?”

“In all honesty it was an experiment. Because you’re supposed to get them with crosses and Christian symbols. But I thought to myself surely any religious symbol would work as long as you believed in it. And I was right!” 

“Well done.”

“Thanks.” She grinned. “Oh I should really get back inside before my Mum catches me out of bed.” She shoved the evil eye pendant in my hand. “Good luck out there.” She saluted me before she ran off down the hallway.



Curiously, I held the evil eye in my hand, looking at it under the fluorescent lights of the tower block staircase. I knew nothing of their history or what they meant, but I saw it work and therefore I believed in it. Therefore, if Nyx is to be believed, it will work again. I shoved the talisman into my pocket and skated home as fast as I could, my head turning at every shadow and jumping at every sound. Luckily, I didn’t encounter any more vampires. Maybe the evil eye acts as a ward too. 



When I got home, I searched the internet for the woman’s name. The bastard known as Seb Forsythe has an assistant known as Hannah Fox. But that answer didn’t feel good enough. I looked up Hannah and I found a forum that had been discussing her similarity to a German political figure from the 1930’s. The people in the forum had put a side by side of Hannah Fox and Heidi Weiss, a famously cruel Nazi campaigner and wife of high ranking SS officer. 



The two were identical.
