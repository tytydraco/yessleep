Sand shifted beneath my feet as I shambled down the river’s edge. I tried to recall what had happened, but the throbbing pain pulsing at my left temple robbed me of any conscious thought. A strange static filled the space between my ears. It wasn’t like the kind you’d find on the tv at odd hours in the night, but more so the soft hum of recycled air piping through a small nozzle above your seat on a plane.   
  
I felt like I was in a fishbowl. My vision would blur, then clear and blur once more. I struggled to keep my balance as I stepped through silt and wet stone.   
  
There was no sign of my kayak or gear anywhere. The gray waters roared across boulders as trees loomed over the edges of the bank. Massive, gnarled roots crept through the ground to gather a drink. The underbrush above the bank was so thick it was impossible to guess at how far I’d drifted before washing up here.   
  
I said a prayer to a God I’d long forgotten; keep me safe… please.  
  
I had no desire to get lost in the surrounding forest, so I decided to follow the river. It seemed like the best and only option I really had. Surely, I would eventually come to a bridge that would put me on a road. Then I could flag someone down for help. Or maybe there would even be a clearing where I could gather my bearings. Perhaps a house or a farm would be there.   
  
I’d read that in these situations, a positive attitude was essential for survival.   
  
But the further I got down the bank, the more worry festered in my brain. It punched holes in my flimsy optimism. I was always cursed with being an overthinker, and now more than ever it felt like a mental prison.   
  
What if I have a concussion?  
  
What if I never find anyone and starve to death out here?  
  
Or worse, what if something starving finds me?  
  
The thought sent shivers down my spine. I reassured myself that bear sightings in Kentucky were very rare, and that I also was likely the only cougar around.   
  
A much needed giggle escaped my lips. I wasn’t really that old, although if you asked my mother, I was certainly way too old not to be married yet. Is 34 too old to be single? I shrugged. Maybe if I did have a husband though, I wouldn’t be alone right now in the middle of the god-forsaken wilderness…  
  
I finally came to a bend in the river a few miles down and silently prayed that just around it laid some sort of civilization. My heart sunk once I saw it was just more of the same on the other side. Trees as far as the eye could see.   
  
For the first time on one of my adventures, I missed the city. I promised myself that after I got out of here, I’d sell all my hiking equipment and never leave Cincinnati again.   
  
IF… I ever got out of here.   
  
My calves screamed as I trudged several more miles down the bank. My mouth was as dry as cotton and my stomach rumbled with hunger.   
  
It was looking bleak. That positive mindset had just about fully decayed when I caught a glimpse of something bright yellow near the water’s edge.   
  
It couldn’t be…  
  
I screeched with joy and sprinted towards my pack. I grabbed the bag and hugged it like it was a long lost relative.   
  
Jesus Christ, I couldn’t believe it. I scanned the area hoping I’d see my kayak washed ashore as well, but no such luck. Still… I was pretty damn happy as I pulled out a water bottle and a bag of trail mix from within and devoured them with abandon.   
  
Concern receded just enough for hope to make a reappearance.   
  
I was almost laughing until suddenly, a series of grunts followed by a low growl cut my celebration short.   
  
I froze…   
  
My eyes flicked back and forth, up and down the tree line, but I saw nothing. There was no visible sign of where the sound had come from.   
  
It was definitely an animal. And it sounded, big.   
  
I zipped up my bag and threw it over my shoulders as calmly as I could muster, then continued my travel along the riverbed.   
  
My legs twitched with the desire to run, but I knew that was a terrible idea. Almost everything that saw you run would want to give chase. It was the nature of predators.   
  
After about half an hour I finally released the tension in my shoulders and let myself breathe a little. I told myself I was in the clear, but I just couldn’t shake that feeling of being watched. Like a pair of eyes were fixated on my backside.   
  
I was thankful for my pack that was filled with extra clothes, food and water, but I wish I’d found the other one as well.   
  
My smaller bag contained a map, compass, and GPS phone. God, wouldn’t that be helpful…   
  
One call to mom and she’d summon an army of Park Rangers and law enforcement to get me.   
  
I sighed deeply and pressed onward. No use crying over things that could be but weren’t.   
  
I’d lost track of my steps and wasn’t sure how many more miles I’d covered, but it felt like a lot. Exhaustion permeated my muscles, crept into my bones and tip-toed up into the base of my skull.   
  
I ignored the throbbing of a headache and noticed for the first time that it was getting dark, and quickly. And to make matters worse a rumble of thunder sounded in the distance.   
  
“Great…” I muttered.   
  
There were small cave-like divots pressed into the sides of the riverbank, I searched for one large enough to give me some shelter for the night. Much to my dismay, I wasn’t getting out of here today and I desperately needed some sleep.   
  
After an hour of clearing my spot of rocks, then gathering twigs and dead grass from above, I was able to get a small fire going at the mouth of the hole. Thankfully, my trusty lighter came through in a pinch.   
  
If only that joint I’d been saving wasn’t in the small pack…   
  
The fire warmed the space quickly and muted the smell of earth and moss. I tried to keep my eyes open for a while longer to see if the storm would reach me but couldn’t. My eyelids were too heavy, my body screamed for sleep, and it overtook me despite the roar of thunder above.   
  
\----   
  
Lightning and heavy rain ripped me from my sleep.   
  
My pants were saturated with mud from where the rain had blown in while I slept. I could see the river had risen further up the bank and was now only a few feet from the entrance of my burrow.  
  
My mind was spinning as I tried to decide what to do when lightning struck a tree on the other side of the bank. It illuminated the black void of the night and for just a moment I thought I saw something on the other side of the dark waters.   
  
My heart thundered in my chest. I could swear I saw something out there, watching…  
  
No, it couldn’t be. It had to have been a trick of the light…   
  
Another strike lit up the earth.   
  
A large, black shape towered over a boulder just on the other side. I couldn’t make out it’s features but it’s face looked white as bone with huge antlers spanning over its head like deciduous tree limbs.    
  
I panicked and sprung from my hiding place like a rabbit.   
  
I clawed up the wet clay of the riverbank and blindly tore through the edge of the forest. Limbs and brush whipped at my face and grabbed at my clothing.   
  
All sense was abandoned, flight had taken over.   
  
My legs carried me for as long as they could until I doubled over at the base of an oak tree and emptied the contents of my stomach.   
  
The rain was almost deafening as it pounded on the leaves above, and yet… three grunts… a growl…   
  
It was close.   
  
I couldn’t see a damn thing. I had to move with my hands outstretched in front of me so that I didn’t collide with a tree.   
  
I pushed deeper into the vegetation, completely unsure of where I was going. But something told me, if it caught me, I was dead. Or worse than dead.   
  
I’d read an article last summer that had stuck with me for the better part of a year, where a girl from Russia had been hiking when a Grizzly bear had descended upon her. She’d played dead like you’re supposed to, but I guess it was hungry and began eating her from the feet up. She called her mother and spoke with her for a while as it ate her.   
  
That story looped in my mind like a nightmare as I wept, pushing through thorns, honeysuckle, and saplings.  
  
I patted the Swiss Army knife in my jean pocket and quietly decided that if I was going to be slowly eaten, I’d jam the blade into my neck.  
  
But I prayed it wouldn’t come to that.   
  
More grunts and growls bellowed from somewhere deep within the bowels of the forest. I screamed back this time as tears mixed with rain on my cheeks.   
  
This is it, this is how I die…   
  
The thought felt resolute and concrete. A fact.   
  
But just as I was about to be resigned to it, mercy found me in the darkness.   
  
Headlights cut through the tree trunks about thirty yards away.   
  
I screamed for help as I rushed towards them.   
  
A semi-truck was turning around a bend as I spilled out onto the asphalt, falling to my knees.   
  
I could hear its brakes lock up as the truck skidded towards me, but I couldn’t move. My chest heaved with heavy sobs as the grill of the rig came to almost kiss my forehead.   
  
“WHAT IN GOD’S NAME!” I heard the driver holler as they slammed the door and raced around to the front.   
  
“Are you okay?! What the hell are you doing out here?” A portly woman in overalls grabbed me by the shoulders and examined my face.   
  
But I couldn’t answer. I was too afraid. Too tired.   
  
“Come on honey, let’s get you in the truck.”   
  
She helped guide me up into the cab on the passenger’s side as she told me everything was going to be okay.   
  
I thought… maybe it could be.   
  
Maybe I was okay.   
  
But as soon as hope bubbled to the surface, it once again was massacred by this new reality.   
  
I watched as she waddled around the side of the semi until disappearing in front of the engine block. I saw a flicker of a shadow in the headlights just for a moment.   
  
Then the cab shook slightly. I gasped and leaned over the dash, desperately searching for the woman but I didn’t see her.    
  
My breath pinched off in my throat like a closed pipe. The suspense of the next ten seconds felt like an eternity.   
  
Curly red hair popped over the hood. I furrowed my brow, what the fu…  
  
Then a terrified face emerged, eyes wide like saucers.   
  
“Oh, God… no…” I whispered.  
  
The woman vomited a stream of crimson blood over the hood.   
  
She mouthed something that I couldn’t make out in the rain fall and then was lifted fully into view, impaled in the torso upon massive antlers.   
  
I screamed and threw myself into the driver’s seat.   
  
The gears groaned in protest as I tried to remember how to work the double clutch. My stepdad had been a trucker his entire life and had shown me how to do it… once.   
  
I finally got it into 1-Low after shouting obscenities at the column.   
  
The truck lurched forwards as I watched as the poor woman disappear below the hood again.   
  
The cab rocked violently as I rolled over her and the creature.   
  
A squeal as loud as a dozen elk came from the undercarriage.   
  
I shifted to second gear, then third as I cleared over the top of them.   
  
I watched the rearview mirror as I drove down the hill. I caught a glimpse of it coming to stand, towering over the road.   
  
“FUCK YOU!” I screeched like a Valkyrie.   
  
The turbo whistled as I sped like a madman until it was out of sight.  
  
I drove and drove. Not even stopping at the first two towns I came across. Not until the sun was fully up.   
  
The tears were dry, and my mind was blank. That strange static came back to fill my head. But this time it was much louder, more like a haunted television. And inside the static I was crying out, but I was lost under the noise.   
  
\----  
  
The next day I gave the police my statement, or at least a version of it.   
  
I didn’t lie… but I didn’t tell them everything either because I knew they wouldn’t believe it.   
  
It was chalked up to an animal attack. The National Wildlife Department was looking into it.   
  
Cheryl Kramer was the name of the woman who’d tried to help me. They never found trace of her. I knew that they wouldn’t…   
  
When I got home to my apartment I did just what I’d promised, I sold all my gear and donated any hiking clothes I had.   
  
Everything went back to normal for a while. But sometimes when it rained… I could swear I could see something across the street in the open lot.   
  
Waiting…   
  
Watching…
