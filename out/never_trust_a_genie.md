“Why is this beer gold?”



I shrugged and opened it anyway in an alcohol fueled haze. *Maybe I got the lucky one,* I thought.



Maybe the unlucky one instead.



As soon as I popped the top, a thick blue smoke began to pour from the can, filling the room. When I tell you that immediately I freaked out, oh, man, I mean it. I pulled my shirt up over my mouth and nose, and started waving my hands over the can, trying to disperse the strange fog. My mind immediately went to chemical warfare, mustard gas, Agent Orange. I’d been fairly outspoken at the time about political issues, but… who would really try to take me out like that?  
  
**“It’s not going to hurt you.”**



I jumped, swore, and turned. *Who the fuck?* But when I saw the tall blue-skinned man in the corner of my room, I felt all the color drain from my face. *There’s no way… what?*



“You’re… uh… what?”  
  
**“I am your genie. You have released me from my prison, for which I thank you, and now grant you the customary three wishes. Be warned, h-”**  
  
I cut him off as I continued freaking out. “WHAT. No. Get the fuck- wait… How did you get in here? I’ll call the cops right now, I swear to god. Get out of my fucking house.” He chuckled, and continued.



**“You opened my vestibule. I am now in your service for the duration of three wishes. But be warned, human, your wishes will not always come to fruition as you expect.”**  
  
A genie. A literal fucking genie. I want you to picture this with me. It’s 4 AM, I’m positively hammered, and there’s a FUCKING GENIE standing three feet away from me. Should I trust this? No. But am I going to? Of course.



*I know what I want my first wish to be, but… I have to test this first. Have to make sure this will work out like I want.*



I cleared my throat, and looked over at the genie. “I wish I had three million dollars.”  
  
**“Wish granted. You had three million dollars, which you promptly lost gambling.”**  
  


*Fuck.* “Okay, I see what you did there. I wish my mother was still alive, cancer free, debt free, living in this city.”  
  
**“Wish granted. Your mother is alive, well, and wants nothing to do with you.”**  
  
I snatched my phone off of the coffee table faster than I ever have, and called my mom’s number. She answered with an exasperated sigh. Even that was music to my ears.  
  
“Ryan, what do you want this time? You know I’m busy,” she said. I choked up, took a second to compose myself, and finally answered. “Hey, uh… nothing really, mom. I just wanted to hear your voice.” She scoffed. “Don’t call me again. I can’t do anything to help you, Ryan.” 



Tears fell down my face as I hung up the phone. “You were right, I guess…” I said to the genie.



**“I warned you, child.”**



It was at that moment that I absolutely lost my mind. “This is your fucking fault! I didn’t ask for this! What, you just show up whenever you want and fuck with people’s heads? What fucking good are you?!” The genie didn’t react at all. Just responded.



**“You opened the beer, child. I only answered the call.”**  
  
I’m ashamed to admit that I spent longer than I’d have liked destroying my room and trying to hurt the genie… Everything I threw at him went through his body as if he was entirely incorporeal. After twenty minutes or so, I realised what I was doing wasn’t actually doing anything. I sighed, sat down, and grabbed my last beer from the case, which I’d unfortunately forgotten to put in the fridge.

I tried to say “I wish this beer was cold,” but I was drunk, on edge, still freaking out. I think I misspoke. I think what I actually said was, “I wish this beer was gold.”  
  
**“Wish granted.”**
