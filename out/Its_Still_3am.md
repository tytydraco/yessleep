Is anybody there?



Please, if you’re reading this, find me. I’m on the roof of the sporting goods store on Main Street. I’ve got two flood lights hooked up, the heaviest ones I could carry up the ladder. I think I’ll get more when I’m done writing this. If the lights and flares aren’t enough, the gunshots should help. 



I can’t be alone. Someone else has to be awake. Why is this happening to me? Am I dead? Would that be better, or worse?



I don’t know how long it’s been. Days? A week, maybe? I measure in wakes and sleeps now. I still have my watch, though I’m not sure why. It’s just like the rest. 



Maybe if I keep writing, I’ll find a clue. Maybe the answer is in the past. It’s certainly not here. Wherever here is. 



I dropped out of college. Trying to pay attention to the professors was like those drunks at the cowboy bars trying to stay on top of the mechanical bull. I wanted to learn. Or, I wanted to want to learn. But everything was just so… beige. Flat and bland for all the pomp and circumstance and expectation. I couldn’t have given less of a shit about anything they said. It seemed like I wasn’t alone, that only about a quarter of the students actually wanted to be there. That always made me sad. Here these professors were, trying to teach young people something that they cared about, and their words were sliding out of my head as fast as they entered. I finally figured that I was a waste of academic space, and should get out of the way to let someone in who deserved it. 



Which was all well and good, until I realized where I would have to go. 



I hadn’t spoken to Mom since I was eighteen. I hadn’t shut her out, but she didn’t use the phone and I’d moved to the city. I tried to barter with the school, to convince them to let me keep a sliver of my scholarship until I could land a job. Their curt and final refusal had my compact Hyundai stuffed with belongings in two frantic days. I remember looking at it and taking a mental picture. Not sure why. It definitely wasn’t a fond moment, or a proud one. I spent the last dregs of my savings breaking my lease and having the rest of my stuff carted off to the dump. 



It was a long car ride. It felt longer than the three hours it probably was, like every mile added another extra minute, another chance to turn back. But I’d already dropped out, amputating whatever may have been waiting for me at the end of the academic road. My defiant flight from home was ending on the whimper I always felt it would, but pretended otherwise. 



Anxiety mounted as I stepped out of my car and trudged up the walkway sprouted with a forest of weeds and dry worms. Dad’s old van was still parked in the driveway, tires cobwebbed to the fractured concrete. Mom should have moved. She could afford it. Dad’s VA benefits had put me through high school and kept her from full time work. I’m sure that, without me around, she could have done well for herself. If she’d tried.  



The doorbell was dead. I didn’t miss the tacky jingle. I knocked on the security door, rattling the rusted hinges. What would I say? Did I have to say anything? I’m her son, after all. I deserved to be here. I stood on the mildewy porch justifying my presence to myself as the seconds crawled by. The door remained silent and I began to doubt this trip, the life-altering decisions I’d made over the past week. 



A deep creak, like bones on ground-down cartilage, shook me from my spiral. The daylight was such that I couldn’t see past the stippled metal grate of the security door, but I knew the sound.



“Mom?” I said, my voice an octave higher than I meant. There was no reply, but I felt her eyes on me. I cleared my throat. 



“Hi, Mom,” I said, attempting not to sound timid. I tried to stare at the spot I guessed her to be. It would be the least I could do to look her in the eye as I begged for lodging. I thought I might have seen the glimmer of an eye blink past the grate, but it was impossible to tell. 



“I need a place to stay,” I said when the door didn’t open. “Just for a week, maybe two. I…” I think I felt that if I didn’t say it aloud, especially to her, the error of my ways wouldn’t become blatantly apparent. But I owed her an explanation.



“I dropped out,” I mumbled to my shoes. When the metal door didn’t open I was worried I’d been too sheepishly quiet, that I’d have to admit it again, only louder. My teeth began to grind as the embarrassment of prostration reddenned my cheeks. Sweat began beading on my temples as I worked up the nerve to repeat myself. 



A thud from behind the metal door felt like a kick in the stomach. Mom had made her decision. I hadn’t visited, hadn’t made any effort to maintain the relationship - such as it was - and was therefore unworthy of my childhood room. I turned away, a lump swelling in the bottom of my throat as I realized how few options remained, when I heard the hinges creak and a sharp metal click. I turned back, relieved as I opened the unlocked security door. The front door behind it was ajar, chain locks unfastened and swinging. Mom had slipped back into the house, and I followed. 



The house looked strange for its familiarity, like a two to one reconstruction of the place I’d grown up. Same furniture, same drawn curtains, same picture of Dad above his folded flag. Mothballs and dust instead of cookies or bread or other inviting smells. Mom shuffled wordlessly away from me into the adjoining living room, and for a moment I wondered if I’d caught her in a sleepwalk. It would have been early. My room was untouched; I dropped the bags I’d brought and flopped on my bed, taking a deep shuddering breath. My breath shudders a lot. I’m not sure why. 



Dinner was, as usual, whatever I could scrounge. I was able to get a few words from Mom, mostly small talk and goings on around town. When I divulged a little more about my experience at school, her reaction was one of muted resignation. 



“Well, write a book about it,” she said past me, as if I hadn’t just admitted to her my failed pursuit of an English degree. Still, ambivalence was preferable to scorn. I did the dishes - threw away the paper plates and plasticware - and we were both in bed by 9. She by habit, myself by default. What else was I going to do? 



I can’t remember the last time that I had a full, uninterrupted eight hours of sleep. My brain simply refuses to do it. I’ve woken up a little after midnight every night for my entire life. It used to bother me when I was a kid, because I was afraid of the dark. Sometimes the night would stretch on and on and I felt like I’d been forgotten, like an alien or a lonely little ghost. Everyone else could so effortlessly do that most simple, human thing except me. Mom could even do it while muttering and shuffling around our shadowed house, opening and closing doors and drawers like she’d misplaced something. Her lack of response initially frightened me, then merely compounded my loneliness. I felt like a figment of someone else’s dream that they weren’t having. My distended nocturnal limbos terrified me to no end and would feed upon themselves. The slow onset of adulthood gradually eroded the fear, and I learned to use the time productively.



So when I awoke at 3:00 am, it was like any other night. 



My room had an old TV, deep with a convex screen. I rolled out of bed and unearthed my Xbox from my bags. It was leaps and bounds more advanced than my archaic TV, and the technological incongruity was obvious and distracting. I closed my game after about twenty minutes, none the sleepier, and stared at the console’s menu screen. Maybe there was a new game I could get, or an older gem on sale. I still had a little money, I could…



On the top right of my screen, the blurry time read 3:00 am. 



I rubbed my eyes, squinted, went into the settings and changed them, then changed them back. Still 3:00 am. I gave up, forgetting the glitch as I tried to play another game, one I hadn’t played in a while. I think I heard Mom bumping around in the living room at one point. Eventually I turned off the game, frustrated at my waning interest in what had been my primary hobby. I stood to get a drink of water when the alarm clock next to my bed caught my eye. 



3:00 am. 



I was still just irritated at this point. It was just a stopped clock. One of two. I don’t think it was odd enough for me to take active notice. I got some water from the kitchen - Mom was nowhere to be seen - and climbed back into bed. The analog clock above the sink wasn’t discernible in the nighttime gloom, but I know what it read. 



When I woke up again, I didn’t realize I’d fallen asleep. It was still just as dark out, my console was still on. I only registered the passage of time by my shifted sleeping position - I was now flat on my back instead of belly down. Frustration came flooding back as hot as before. Though nighttime waking was normal, it usually only happened once. I thrashed petulantly on the mattress, turning toward the alarm clock for validation. Surely, daylight was minutes away. 



3:00 am. 



It hit me then, though not all at once. Not like a punch or a truck. The realization that something was horribly wrong crawled over and into me like a starving colony of ants. The first burning bites mattered little, but by the end I was screaming for help that would not come. 



I sat up and smacked the clock hard enough to rattle the nightstand. 3:00 am. I slapped it around some more until it fell off, yanking its plug from the socket, 3:00 am static on its face. Floundering off my mattress, I reached for one of my bags and rooted around until I found my old watch. The glowing green analog face showed the minute and hour hands at a perfect L-shaped angle. 



“What the fuck?” I think I whispered, or maybe I just thought loudly. I went into the kitchen, phone light extended before me, to see the same reflected on every digital surface, every wall-mounted timepiece in the house. 



3:00 am. 3:00 am. 3:00 am. 



My chest had begun to constrict, though I pretended I wasn’t afraid, that this was simply a strange and silly phenomenon that I was lucky enough to witness. I had outgrown my childish fear of the night, after all. With a forced half-grin I strode to the light switch and flicked it upwards. I flicked it again to no avail, then the next, then the others as the ants began chewing up my back. We must have had an outage, I thought, until I realized that the frozen clocks still glared, the porchlight still flickered with moths. I paced to keep the jelly from my legs, uncaring of the noise I was likely making. In an indiscriminate outburst of anxiety I walked over to the microwave and unplugged it, expecting the taunting 3:00 am to wink away. Instead I stared back and forth between the length of cable in my hand and the impossibly functional appliance.



I took a shaky breath, standing and running my hands through my hair, then grasping a strand between my thumb and forefinger and yanking hard. The hair popped out with a tiny stab of pain and I remained where I was, unwoken from what I had hoped was a nightmare. I tugged out a few more, every pinprick another layer of dread. The harrowing realization trailed another close behind. I had to tell Mom. 



I shuffled toward the darkened doorway at the other end of the room, nerves of a different sort compounding with every step despite the increasingly alien circumstances. All awakenings were rude when it came to my mother, and deeply ingrained practices screamed at me not to pass this threshold. I teetered at her door, irrationally unsure if this was worth her time. 



Eventually, loitering felt dumber than entry, so I cautiously pushed aside the ajar door and crept into her room. I always hated shag carpet, and was reminded as much as I crossed to her bedside. She slept on her back, hands at her side like a prepared cadaver. 



“Mom,” I whispered. “Mom, something’s going on.”



Time slowed to syrup as I waited, tensed for the imminent growl or moan or curse. But nothing came.



“Mom,” I whispered again, not raising my tone but leaning closer. “Mom, wake up.”



The distended seconds began collapsing in on each other as she remained silent and unresponsive. 



“Mom?” I said as the ants passed over my shoulders. “Mom!”



I was yelling now, leaning close and shaking her. Frantic, I jammed two fingers against her neck and was flooded with relief as I felt a healthy pulse beneath her jawbone. 



“Oh, thank God,” I said, almost laughing. I fumbled for my phone and dialed 911, stroking her hair and steadying my breath. “You’ll be okay,” I said to her. “You’ll be okay.”



After the fourth ring I held the phone away, staring at the screen in confusion. After the tenth I hung up and redialed, realizing the terror had receded only as it came crawling back with renewed fervor. 



They never picked up. No one has. 



I let the phone ring on speakerphone and sat in Mom’s room for a while - I can’t be sure how long - thinking myself into anxious spirals. I was worried enough for her that the frozen clocks, strange though they were, had taken a backseat in my mind. I decided suddenly that if 911 wouldn’t pick up, I would wake the neighbors. I stood, kissed her forehead and strode out of her room’s back door. The backyard, unlike the house’s interior, was not how I remembered it even in the low light. The once lush and trimmed lawn now only existed in memory; the yard’s desolate, martian visage made me feel all the more alien and stranded. I paced around the side of the house and to the first neighbor on the right, banging on and shouting at their metal door. As when I tried to wake my mother, I braced for a storm of irritated vitriol but was instead left waiting. I hammered and yelled until it became clear I was being ignored, which only lit a fire under me as I moved onto the next house with even less decorum and tact. When they didn’t reply I shouted about fire, murder and other things that people might actually care about. I figured that making it about them could actually elicit a response. 



It was only after the fourth or fifth house that the true, incomprehensible scope of my situation began to take shape. I stumbled back from another silent house, panting with exertion, vocal cords already strained from my tirades. I thought about my Mom, catatonic in her bed despite my accosting, and began to realize that my predicament might be far, far worse than I thought. 



That was five sleeps ago. I’ve walked the town twice over at this point and haven’t seen a soul. I found out quickly that cars don’t work; mine, or anyone else’s whose keys I could find. Once the thirst and hunger set in I abandoned the pretense of private property. I loot supermarkets if I’m close. If not… I’ve lost all qualms about breaking and entering. What I wouldn’t give to get arrested. I’ve banged pots and pans next to sleeping heads, activated blenders on nightstands, shot firearms in backyards once I’d broken into the sporting goods store. All unresponsive as Mom.



Well, except for the one. 



On the second wake that I’d been breaking in, I was still shaking strangers’ shoulders. The attempt felt futile at that point, but the last thread of hope drove me to act despite the metastasized despair. I’d recovered the necessary water and foodstuffs and had just left a couple’s room after unsuccessfully attempting to rouse them. The final room had a smaller bed and was adorned with large, flowery pillows. In the nighttime pallor, the accoutrements were a different shade of pale, and were probably variations of pink in the daytime. I approached the bed, holding out hope that this was the person, the one who would finally awake and join me. I leaned close when I saw something I hadn’t in what felt like forever. 



The girl’s eyes stared back at me. 



The whites were visible all the way around, indicating the sheer terror that I knew all too well. I jerked back, hope flaring in my chest. 



“Hello?” I said. “Can you… can you see me?”



I moved slowly around the bed. The girl’s petrified eyes followed me as I did, and my chest began to heat as vague, tantalizing possibility spread before me after so long without. I wasn’t alone, hope cried triumphantly. *I wasn’t alone.* 



“It’s alright,” I lied, creeping closer excitedly and extending a hand. “It’s okay. I’m here. We’ll figure this out.”



The little girl made no move, no answer. She simply stared back, terror mounting in her now watering eyes. I felt the hope - the stupid, evil hope - drain from me like arterial blood as she remained, for all intents and purposes, as immobile and useless as the rest.



Since her, I’ve stopped trying to rouse them. 



The moths are still here, cloistered around every light source like flies to decomposition. So if moths have souls, I guess I have seen some. I think I’ve seen more the past couple of wakes. They’re starting to blot out the lightbulbs. The ants are always here, too, chewing at my chest and legs and lungs. Sometimes I’ll be walking the streets or plundering a house and they’ll surge, making me hyperventilate and almost fall over. It’s the not knowing that’s the worst. I don’t have a plan. As alone as I’ve ever felt in my life, there were always people within reach, though they felt inaccessible at the time. Now I’d give my limbs to talk to another person. The moths are not enough. 



Today I stood at the intersection of Aveline and Moor and looked out into the blackness. I think the next town is forty something miles away. The country roads are unlit, black and barren as space. I could walk into the dark, flashlight stretched before me, following the asphalt and signage. But as I stood on that shadowed drop off, my guts screamed to turn back, to return to the familiar isolation. At least there, mothy lights glow. 



I’ve checked on Mom once since this started. I’ll keep going back just to make sure. Maybe one day she’ll sleepwalk again, and I can pretend I have someone else. 



When I was a kid, the sunlight always peeked through at the end of the infinite nights, either by virtue of time or the blissful onset of sleep. Hope led me to believe that, as before, such would be my salvation. Now I only yearn for the death of hope, if respite is unattainable. 



I have five flares and two boxes of shotgun shells left before I have to climb back down into the store. I’ll keep making noise and shining lights. Besides that, all I can do is hope that someone is reading this. If you are, you are my savior. I can’t be alone. I can’t be dead. I can’t be left behind. Please find me. Soon. 



Because as I’m writing this, the lights are starting to go out.
