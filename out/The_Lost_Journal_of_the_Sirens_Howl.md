October the 14th, Anno Domini 1692 – Morning

I pen these words not in hope of rescue, but to leave a record, lest the horrors that have befallen us be forgotten. Should ye find this journal, I beg ye, turn back. The Siren’s Howl is accursed, and the terror that stalks these waters will claim ye as it hath claimed us.

It was three weeks hence that the crew first spoke of strange wailings carried upon the wind—faint, at first, but growing louder each night. I dismissed their claims as the wild imaginings of men too long at sea. Yet soon the sounds grew unmistakable. Low, guttural groans rising from beneath the waves, reverberating through the very timbers of the ship. It seemed as though the ship herself trembled in fear of what lay beneath.

October the 16th – Dusk

The sea lies unnaturally calm. No wind to fill the sails, no waves to rock the ship. The men speak of shadows beneath the water, but refuse to man the crow’s nest or peer over the side. A dark presence stirs beneath us.

Jenkins came to me this eve, pale and trembling, swearing he had seen something in the depths. “A shadow, Captain,” he whispered. “Movin’ fast, like a serpent below the ship.”

I chastised him for his foolish talk, yet I could not shake the feeling that he spoke true. I, too, have glimpsed the shadow, though it moves so quickly I scarce believe my own eyes. The men have taken to whispering prayers, though we be far from any church.

October the 17th – Nightfall

We are lost.

The creature hath risen from the deep.

The Siren’s Howl was seized as if by the hand of some great leviathan, the deck lurching beneath our feet, casting men overboard like toys. From the abyss it rose—its skin black as night, slick with the foul waters of the deep. I saw its eyes, glowing like embers in the dark, staring up at us with a malice I cannot describe. Its maw opened wide, revealing rows of teeth the size of cutlasses, gleaming in the moonlight.

The roar that followed… God preserve us. It shook the heavens, and the sea itself answered, rising in a great swell that cast us into chaos. Half the crew are lost—some swallowed by the beast, others dragged beneath the waves.

October the 18th – Dawn

We drift aimlessly now, the sea stretching endlessly in every direction. The beast has not shown itself again, but it waits. I know it is still there, lurking just beneath the waves. The men whisper of hearing voices, calling to them from the deep. Last night, Miller threw himself overboard, and the water claimed him without a sound. The sea was still, as though it, too, feared what lay beneath.

October the 20th – Night

The end draws near. The Siren’s Howl is doomed, and we are but ghosts, trapped upon her cursed decks. The beast toys with us, dragging us deeper into its domain with each passing day.

I alone remain, for the others have been claimed—by the sea or by madness. Jenkins was the last, taken by the creature in the dead of night. I hear the whispers now. They call to me, promising an eternity beneath the waves, in darkness, in hunger.

If ye be reading this, know that the beast yet lives. The Siren’s Howl is its snare, and ye have fallen into its trap. Flee whilst ye can, for the creature shall not rest. It waits beneath the waves, ever patient, ever hungry.

Note (Written in the margins, recently added):

The pages of this journal were found aboard an old, derelict ship, adrift with no crew. Though the vessel’s name was unreadable, the markings match the descriptions of the Siren’s Howl as recorded in maritime lore.

We found the ship abandoned in the middle of the Atlantic, no signs of life, yet still in eerily good condition. Something about this place feels wrong. The further we searched the ship, the more oppressive the air became. We’re hearing sounds—scraping, like something moving below. We plan to leave first thing in the morning, but the ship… it feels like it doesn’t want us to go.

If anyone reads this, heed the captain’s warning. We may have stumbled upon something far older and darker than we can understand.

We hope to make it out.
