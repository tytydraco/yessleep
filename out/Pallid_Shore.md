I wasn’t even supposed to be in that row.

Our access schedule is tightly rotated—metadata inventories, environmental checks, reboxing for degradation. You get your assignment, you clock in, you don't wander.

Row 12-D glitched during my pull request, and I was redirected to what we call the Long-Term Displacement Vaults. That’s where the box turned up.

It was tucked at the bottom of a tall rack under a false label: AGRI-EXPORT: CORN 1937–1939. No barcode, just a thin red ribbon looped through the file handle. That’s usually how they flagged it back in the ‘40s—before color coding systems were formalized. Red meant “unclassified, but keep out of reach.”

I opened it. Inside were brittle, yellowing folders stamped with a different heading: PALLID SHORE

Beneath that, in smaller type:
“Initiated 1949 – Site 14 Coastal Operations Annex”
It sounded like something to do with naval intelligence, maybe weather monitoring or shoreline logistics. But the paper didn’t match any logistics format I knew. It smelled like damp basements and metal filing drawers left untouched for decades.

The first folder was labeled POST-BROADCAST CIVILIAN ATMOSPHERICS – WOTW, Oct. ’38. Inside: thin carbon copies, onion skin paper, typed in courier, margins filled with stamped classifications like “EYES ONLY” and “INTERNAL PSYCH BRANCH – TEMP FILE.” It looked like OSS chatter—jumpy, semi-coded, full of clipped phrases and strange allusions.

Most of it was compiled months after the War of the Worlds panic. Notes, memos, incident summaries. The kind of language that made everything sound tidy, even when it wasn’t:

“Initial audio fiction broadcast yielded regional destabilization. Civilian agitation limited but instructive. Noted: 2hr duration of mass belief in atmospheric assault. Consider utility for counter-narrative planning.”

“Public suggestibility demonstrated in absence of direct threat. Aerial mythos engagement high. Sociological camouflage potential viable.”

“Recommend experimental amplification: controlled leaks, optical fabrication. Scope to be aligned with post-theater intelligence recovery (see: Berlin asset lists – V-Waffe div.)”

One memo caught my attention. It was marked “OSS–NAVINT Intersect, 1946” and listed several German terms I half-recognized from a Cold War seminar—Flugscheibe, Gerät 46, and something labeled U-Projekt 12: Atlantic Retrieval.

There was no direct mention of UFOs. Not yet. But there was this:

“Soviet and civilian interception of test materials increasingly probable. Recommend supplementary myth to mitigate pattern recognition. Develop programmatic disinformation vector via emergent aviation anomalies.”

“Directive codename: PALLID SHORE. Initial operations to commence via press dispersals, photographic fabrications, and folklore injection.”

Folklore injection.

It felt like I had swallowed something dry and jagged.

Beneath the memos, I felt a shift—the texture changed. That unmistakable smooth, heavy feel of old photographic paper, gone soft at the edges with time.

I brushed back the last few pages and found a stack of 8x10 prints, each slipped between thin waxy sheets. No labels. Few captions. The hum of something carefully staged.

The first photo showed a metal disc—classic saucer shape—propped on cinder blocks in what looked like a soundstage. Floodlights. Painted backdrop. A man in coveralls holding a clipboard stood beside it, partially turned, face obscured. Behind him, a wooden rigging system—not for flight, but for camera work.

The next was worse. A mock classic alien figure, maybe three feet tall. Big head. Bulging eyes. But up close, the illusion cracked: seams at the neck, what looked like stitched vinyl arms. The doll stood on a folding table, surrounded by men in military dress.

One of the photos had a typed sticker on the back:
Studio: Warner Bros. – Burbank Lot 3
Contract: PALLID SHORE, Phase II
Set Supervisor: Redacted

I kept flipping. The photos got bolder.

A technician applying gloss paint to latex “skin.” Another adjusting a wire support behind the knees of a slouched, limp grey figure. The background changed—sometimes it was a desert set, sometimes a forest.

One envelope inside the folder held receipts—contracted work from Ideal Toy Company for “posable figures, non-articulated, child-scale.” Another from Western Effects Ltd., detailing “metallic domes, 2.5m diameter, interior shells hollow—camera only.”

I was sweating.

There were posed crash photos, too. A broken saucer shell lying in dirt, with fake scorch marks and a singed bush. On the edge of the frame, someone had carelessly left a thermos.

The kind of mistake people make when they’ve done something too many times.

I put the prints down.

The psyop wasn’t just rumor control.

They’d built the myth frame by frame.

I slid the prints back between their sheets, careful not to smudge the corners. The ache in my knees hit me all at once—hot, stiff, deep. I must have been kneeling for over an hour.

I closed the folder gently. Replaced it exactly where I’d found it. I even gave the whole stack a neat little pat, the way we’re trained to do in box prep orientation, like the pages were just old budget manifests or train schedules.

There are cameras in every corridor. They don’t record sound. But someone watching closely would notice a deviation—too much time in one row, unusual posture, a missed scheduled return.

So I moved slowly. Deliberately. I checked a few adjacent labels. Tapped the edge of another file box like I was counting stock. I even whistled under my breath, something tuneless and forced, just in case.

Then I walked.

The hallways curve slightly, just enough to fool your sense of direction. There are no windows, no clocks, and the fluorescent lights hum just low enough to feel like pressure in your skull. I turned right, then right again, passed the laminated sign for Row 14-F, then descended the shallow ramp that leads to staff commons.

The break room is what you'd expect—linoleum, government-issue chairs, a single vending machine that eats your change.

Ed was already in there, hunched over a magazine about trout fishing, chewing on a green apple like he had all the time in the world. He nodded at me, not lifting his eyes from the page.

“You’re still down in the D rows?” he asked, like he was asking about the weather.

“Yeah,” I said. My voice sounded normal. I was grateful for that. “Some old ag files. Corn shipments.”

He grunted, took another bite. Crunch echoed off the tile.

I poured myself bad coffee, sipped just enough to feel real, then left.

The ride home was quiet. No music. I kept replaying the photos in my head—the doll’s stitched hands, the desert backdrop, the thermos left in the frame like some cosmic joke.

When I got inside, I sat at my laptop. Opened a blank browser tab.

Typed:
pallid shore project ufo

Then I froze.

If this was real—if what I saw wasn’t some elaborate archival prank—then a search from my home IP would flag. Maybe not today. Maybe not for weeks. But someone, somewhere, would see it.

I closed the tab.

Tomorrow, or next week, I’d find a library across state lines, maybe a net café, if those still exist. Somewhere with no trace. Somewhere no one knows my name.

I needed to know how deep this went.

But I already knew one thing for sure:

There was more to this ...

I planned the drive like a man casing a crime.

No phone. Left it on my kitchen counter face-down, next to the toaster. I wiped down the countertop just in case. Grabbed a jacket I hadn’t worn in months. Swapped my usual car keys for a spare set I’d quietly copied from my neighbor’s garage-hung ’99 Dodge Ram—the kind of truck that blends in anywhere and has no GPS to track.

I took the back roads. No interstate. Just grey light through late autumn trees and AM static on the dash. I drove for hours, crossing two state lines before pulling into a small town called Haddonville—one of those places where gas pumps are manual and no one looks you in the eye unless you speak first.

Their public library was exactly what I needed—no cameras, no Wi-Fi, a smell like old encyclopedias and hand sanitizer. The front desk clerk was too bored to notice I signed in with a fake name.

I typed “Pallid Shore” into their ancient 'web' computers that still had one of those big CRT monitors.

Nothing.

Not one article. Not one index card. Not even a typo-corrected suggestion.

No search results—just that blank “no matches found” line blinking back at me like it had been waiting for me to try.

I scrolled through adjacent keywords, just in case:
naval psyops, ufo fabrication, Wunderwaffe capture, OSS deception programs.

Still nothing.

That night, I barely slept. I kept seeing the doll’s hands, the seam behind its ear. How meticulous it all was.

And I kept thinking: if it doesn’t exist online, maybe it only ever existed on paper.

The next Monday, back at work, I kept it slow. Normal.

Did my rounds. Logged inventory. Spoke just enough to be forgettable.

By mid-afternoon, I made my move.

I flagged down Russell—junior archivist, quiet kid, always chewing on his badge lanyard.

Told him I needed to confirm a potential misfile in the Personnel–Projects crossover boxes, something from the P-section that might’ve been cross-listed before the FOIA standardization.

He nodded, half-listening, and waved me off with a clipboard.

By 3:10, I was at the old card catalog, tucked behind the microfilm cabinets in Row 7-C. Nobody used it anymore. The drawers were stiff, the wood splintered where the varnish had dried out decades ago.

I pulled open the one labeled P–Q.

Near the back, I found it. A single yellowing card, handwritten in tight, clinical script:

PALLID SHORE – Defense Narrative Simulation (1949–1970)
See Also: Strategic Fabrications Unit – “Shoreline Projects”

There was no barcode.

But there was a stamped number.

Not Row 19-G.

Lower Annex 3 – Sublevel E (Vault Reference: P-SHORE.04)

I froze.

I’d never heard of a Sublevel E.

The archive goes down four sublevels on the system map. But we’re only cleared through C. I’d never seen D, and E wasn’t even listed.

I ran my finger across the card again, like the number might disappear.

It didn’t.

And I knew—whatever this was, it didn’t want to be found again.

The next day, I waited until late afternoon—when the floors thin out, and the admin staff upstairs starts logging out early. I ran a fake cross-reference request on an outdated terminal to justify a trip to Sublevel D.

The elevator rattled as it descended. Floor lights ticked by: A, B, C… D. The doors opened with a hiss and a mechanical stutter.

Sublevel D was colder than I remembered. Quieter, too. The hum of machinery above faded into a deadened stillness, like sound didn’t carry right down here.

I walked past the usual shelving banks and turned down an unlit service corridor. Halfway down, I spotted it.

A fire escape door.
Painted gray. Dented at the bottom. No camera above it.

No lock either.

I pressed the bar, and it opened with a metallic sigh.

Behind it: a narrow stairwell, the kind that makes you feel like you’re trespassing into history. Cold concrete. Rust along the rail. And below me, just one more flight of steps disappearing into dark.

I went down.

At the bottom was another door—older, made of brushed steel. No keypad. No badge reader.

Just a yellowed sign, bolted to the wall beside it:

⚠ ACCESS RESTRICTED
ARCHIVAL RETAIN: LEVEL E – NONPUBLIC HOLDINGS
AUTHORIZED CLEARANCE ONLY – NARA INTERNAL BRANCH

By order of Strategic Records Command, 1974

The lettering was faded. Corners peeling. But the sign hadn’t been touched in decades.

I pushed the door open.

What greeted me was a gust of warm air and the distant, constant whir of fans.

The hallway beyond was low-ceilinged, wider than it needed to be, with no signs, no paint. The walls were concrete and metal. The floors smooth, sealed tile. The lights above flickered every few seconds like they weren’t sure anyone was still supposed to be here.

The smell hit next—old paper, ozone, and something acrid and plasticky beneath it all, like burned silicon, the kind you smell near ancient servers or early-generation computers left running too long.

Somewhere far down the corridor, a fan groaned. Then another.

The air tasted processed.

Level E went on farther than I could see. Rows and rows of shelves—most of them still full—disappearing into a blue-gray haze under the flickering fluorescents.

Whatever this place was, it hadn’t been cleared out.
Hadn’t been repurposed.
Hadn’t even been sealed.

It had just been… left.

Waiting.

It took me nearly an hour to find the Vault Reference aisle.

Lower Annex 3 curved strangely—it wasn’t gridded like the upper floors. More like a coil, or a loop, with rows misnumbered and signs stenciled by hand. I found P-SHORE etched faintly on the edge of a metal beam above one of the shelving banks.

Row 44-P.

Empty.

The shelf was there. The tag, the slot—everything. But the box itself?

Gone.

No pulled file card. No requisition slip. Just a dust shadow where the container had once been, like someone had quietly removed it years ago.

I stood there for a long time, feeling the low static pulse of the fans, the too-warm air around me, the scent of brittle paper and forgotten electricity.

Then I turned and walked back up.

For weeks, I let it go.

Almost.

I buried myself in record pulls. Logged decommissioned folders. Lost myself in the calm hum of routine and bureaucracy.

A part of me started to write it off. Fabrication. Imagination. A story stitched together from stale caffeine and half-read memos. Something I wanted to mean more than it did.

But then—

Three Fridays later.

I came in early. 7:38 a.m. Lights off in most of the building. Just me and the hum of the badge reader.

My office is small. Half-glass wall, desk barely big enough for two file boxes. I set my thermos down, turned to boot up the system.

And froze.

A box was already sitting there.

Plain, archival gray. Lid on. Edges clean. But the label—

P-SHORE.04

My skin went cold.

I hadn’t filed a request. I hadn’t mentioned it since the day I’d gone down to Level E.

I reached out, heart thudding, and pulled the lid off.

Inside were photo negatives, curled gently with age, some still bound in paper sleeves labeled STF-Phase II, Airfield 5, Interior Mockup A.

I held one up to the light.

Flying saucers—but not flying. Just rigged on gantries, photographed from above, shadows painted on the ground. Another showed vast hangars, warehouse-scale, with dismantled alien figures, joints disconnected, fiberglass insides exposed like mannequins flayed open.

In the bottom corner of the box was a small envelope.

Typed label.

FROM: Allen
Thought I’d give you a hand.
Come see me when you’re done.

My breath caught.

Allen.

The archive manager.

I hadn’t spoken to him in months. He worked two floors up. Oversaw record rotations and special project requests. Quiet. Friendly, in a distant, career-fed way.

But now every worst-case scenario lit up in my head like a board.

Was he testing me? Watching me? Was this a trap?

Or was he the only one who knew what I’d seen?

I walked to his office with my pulse thudding in my neck. The hallway felt longer than usual. The carpet muted everything but the sound inside my skull.

Allen was already seated behind his desk, thumbing through a personnel ledger with the easy rhythm of a man who'd been doing the same job for forty years.

He looked up when I knocked.

“Ah,” he said, smiling like this was a casual meeting. “Come in. Close the door.”

I did.

“Have a seat.”

I sat.

He gestured toward the box still sitting in my arms. “You opened it?”

I nodded.

He nodded back, as if to say good.

“You’ve got questions. I figured you might.”

He leaned back, hands folded neatly. There were plaques on the wall behind him—decades of civil service. A faded Polaroid of an old records room. A smiling group of archivists, all gone now.

Allen spoke evenly, like he was explaining filing protocol to a trainee.

“For decades,” he said, “the United States government has maintained a narrative framework—call it a long-term psychological utility model—rooted in the cultural potency of extraterrestrial belief.”

He smiled faintly at my blank stare.

“I mean UFOs. Aliens. Visitors from beyond.”

He went on, calm as ever.

“After the War of the Worlds broadcast in ’38, a few folks in the intelligence community noticed something... interesting. The panic wasn’t the surprise. The relief afterward was. Something about the fear—about the possibility of not being alone—it did something. It made people feel connected. Hopeful, even.”

He tapped his temple lightly.

“People want to believe there’s something out there. Something bigger. Watching. Waiting. Maybe even intervening.”

Allen leaned forward, voice dropping just a note.

“And when the world begins to slip—economies collapse, wars grind on, people question the ground beneath their feet—well… it’s useful to let them look up instead.”

He smiled again, but this time it didn’t reach his eyes.

“Pallid Shore was just one thread in the tapestry. A controlled myth. A narrative ecosystem. Every so often we let something slip—an image, a memo, a memo that looks like it wasn’t meant to be read. Someone finds it. Whistleblower types. Idealists. They think they’ve uncovered truth.”

He paused.

“But really, we just gave them something to chase. Something to broadcast. And they do. Every time.”

I felt sick.

I swallowed. “So it's all a lie, all of it?”

Allen tilted his head. “Does it matter?”

He let the silence hang, let it settle in my lungs like smoke.

Then, calmly, he said, “Can you be trusted?”

I nodded.

That’s when it happened.

His eyes—still on mine—blinked sideways.

Not a twitch. Not a trick of light. A thin, wet membrane slid from both sides of each eye, meeting in the middle. Then retreated, silent as breath.

And from the side of his mouth, a forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air, glossy and black and wrong.

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t move. Just sat there like nothing had happened.

Then he smiled.

“The best way to hide something,” he said softly, “isn’t to bury a lie inside the truth.”

He leaned forward, voice barely above a whisper.

“It’s to bury the truth inside a lie. So deep, so familiar, that the moment anyone touches it... they hope it’s fiction.”

His smile faded.

“Now,” he said, “how about we talk about your future?”
