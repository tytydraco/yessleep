  
  
I opened the mailbox and started shifting the mail around to see what today's bunch of crap was.  
  
Bill  
  
Bill  
  
Credit card offer  
  
My hand froze as I looked at the envelope, my jaw quivering a little as I read the address on the front and the name of the sender.  
  
This hadn't happened in years, not since I'd left for college, but I had felt safe enough to settle somewhere, hoping that the letters had stopped.  
  
It had been three years since she'd written, but it made me feel like I was a teenager again, fearing that anyone but me would find one of those letters.  
  
From Catherine Mansley to Justin Mansley  
  
Dear brother,  
  
It’s been so long, you should come see me in The Blue.  
  
Love, Catherine.  
  
I tore the letter up and went back inside, trying not to notice how the paper had made my fingers feel clammy and moist. The envelope too had been the same way, moist and difficult to hold. It was like wet paper that had dried badly, but it was always that way. When Catherine sent me letters, they were always like that. I had kept them at first, hiding them so no one would find them, but I burned them now, not wanting them near me.  
  
I picked up my phone to call Daniel, but it went straight to voicemail. I tried my uncle, but Uncle Mike was hoping I had seen him. He said Daniel had been missing for about a week now, and everyone was getting pretty worried. I can hear him calling me as I sit on the floor with my knees against my chest, trying not to hyperventilate, but I know it's useless. That feeling is the closest I can come to drowning, the closest I can come to understanding why Catherine writes these letters.  
  
Daniel, Carter, Clint, Henry, they're all gone now.  
  
I'm the last one that Catherine hasn't got.  
  
When we were kids or early teens, we would all go stay at Grandpa's Cabin over the summer. Grandpa was long dead, Grandma too, but the cabin was always called such. My mom and dad would usually come up first to get it ready, and I loved the times before my cousins got there, the times I could just enjoy the cabin. I haven't been back in years, not since we went to look for Clint, but I can still remember the cabin. It was more a lodge than a cabin, and Dad claimed that Grandpa's Dad (our Great-Grandpa) had built it by hand. It was made from the huge old trees in the area, and it had a big area downstairs with four rooms above it. The rooms were easily as big as hotel rooms, the Motel 6 kind, and they held our family and the families of my cousins easily.   
  
Dad had a brother, Uncle Mike, and a Sister, Aunt Claire, and both of them had two kids.  
  
Catherine was the only girl in the family, other than Aunt Claire, and the youngest. This meant she tried extra hard to keep up with her older cousins and it often led her into trouble. The time she fell out a tree and broke her arm, the time she'd bruised her legs and butt jumping her bike over a fifteen-foot drop, the time she'd nearly drowned at Carffer's Pond, were all times she was trying to keep up with us. We were merciless too, giving her no quarter, and it must have been miserable for her.  
  
We loved to hike and swim and spend time in the cabin, but the thing we all looked forward to seeing the most when we came out here was The Blue.  
  
The Blue was a hole in the woods, more like a pit than anything, with water inside that was perfectly blue, like the stuff inside the jar where the barber keeps his combs. It went thirty feet into the earth, the precipice sheer and easy to stumble into if you weren't paying attention. The water inside was so blue that it hurt your eyes if you looked at it for too long, and it always looked artificial to me. Someone had hung a bridge over it, a rickety thing that swung across on ropes, and my cousins and I thought it was great fun to go and tempt fate by bouncing on it and making it sway.  
  
Thinking about it now makes me downright shudder, but all kids think they're immortal.  
  
I was twelve when it happened, but it could have happened before then easily.  
  
We had been at the cabin a week, swimming and fishing and generally enjoying our time in the woods when Clint said he wanted to go see The Blue today. He said it quietly, because if he had said it any louder, his mom or my mom would have heard and that would have been the end of it. All the adults knew about The Blue and had forbidden us to go anywhere near it. Dad had told us stories about playing on that bridge when he and Uncle Mike were kids, but Aunt Claire had always been too scared to go on that rickety old thing. I think my Dad knew that we were going out to The Blue, probably expected it, and never expressly forbade us to go there, like my mom did. He knew that forbidding it would just make it that much more enticing, and if he let us get it out of our systems, The Blue would become boring all on its own.  
  
I don't think he believed something tragic would happen, but if he had, he might have kept a closer eye on us.  
  
We told our mothers we were going on a hike, Uncle Mike, Uncle Dale, and my Dad having gone out fishing that morning, and they said that was fine but to be back by lunchtime.  
  
We had made our way out as quietly as possible, thinking ourselves clever for not letting Catherine hear us making plans, but no sooner had we jumped off the back porch than here she came with a “Wait for me!”Clint grumbled that we should just run off without her, but that was when my Mom poked her head out and told us not to forget Cat. Catherine seemed pretty pleased with herself as she followed us out of the yard, and as we hiked towards The Blue, she realized where we were going.  
  
“We can't go there,” She said, looking scandalous, “Mommy said it was off limits.”  
  
“Well Mommy isn't here,” said Daniel, “So if you don't want to come, then turn around and go back.”  
  
Catherine seemed to think about it but must have decided it was too far to walk back on her own. We were about two miles into the woods, and despite her desire to follow us everywhere, Catherine was kind of a scaredy-cat. She didn't like being by herself, and it usually led to her getting hurt when she tried to follow us into dangerous situations. She still followed us, but suddenly she was a safe distance away as we made our way toward The Blue.  
  
When the trees parted and the edges of the pit opened up, we knew we had arrived.  
  
“There it is,” Clint breathed, the lip coming into view not long afterward, “So cool.”  
  
We had seen it dozens of times but it was always awe-inspiring.  
  
The hole was like something punched by a meteor, the edges jagged and uneven. Maybe there was a meteor at the bottom, maybe it’s what made the water so blue, but we had never seen it, well, not yet. We were only really interested in the bridge that day and cared nothing for the natural beauty. We spent the first few minutes just leaning over the edge and spitting into the water below. We couldn’t see it when it hit, but we knew it had.  
  
If the side had crumbled we’d have all gone in and then this story might be very different.  
  
“Let’s go on the bridge,” one of them said.  
  
I think it was Clint but it could have been any of them. It was definitely Carter who agreed, but we all wanted to go. The bridge was what we lived for, the thrill we came back for, and the second my hands touched the ropes of that swinging death trap, I felt the adrenaline begin to pump within me.  
  
The bridge was in disrepair from the first time we found it, and it had only gotten worse over the years. It was missing a few boards, the ropes frayed and peeling, and we should have known it was only a matter of time before there was a problem. When we got to the bridge, all of us crowding onto it as we usually did, Henry moved to the front and began swinging it from side to side. The ropes creaked as we all laughed and held on. Henry was quite a bit larger than most of us, and when he rocked the bridge, he really rocked the bridge. It swayed wide over the gap, and we all laughed and joked as we swayed along with it.  
  
We had been cheating death for a couple of minutes when we realized that someone was missing.  
  
We looked back towards the lip of the pit and saw Catherine hunkered in the woods. She was miserable, not liking the sight of us trying to throw ourselves into The Blue, and didn’t seem to want any part of it. We joked and picked at her, but I wish now that I had seen the fear in her eyes and thought better of what we were doing.  
  
I should have been a better big brother on that day.  
  
“Come on, Cat,” Clint said.  
  
“No way,” Catherine said, grabbing one of the trees like we might try to pull her onto the bridge.  
  
“Don’t be a scaredy-cat,” Clint sing-songed, repeating the phrase scaredy-cat again and again as the rest of us picked it up.  
  
I didn’t pick it up till last, but I chanted it right along with the rest of them.  
  
Catherine was clearly on the verge of tears, but she still had her pride. She stomped over to the bridge, as indignant as anyone could be at six, but as she came to the edge, she started to look unsure again. Her hands shook if she reached for the ropes, and when Henry stepped out of the way, she walked hesitantly onto the rickety boards of the bridge. Henry closed off her retreat, and she stepped closer to our group as she tried her best not to cry.  
  
“All right, Henry, let’s get some big swings this time.” Clint trumpeted.  
  
Henry seemed all too willing to oblige, and soon the bridge was rocking farther than I had ever seen it rock before. It was swinging over The Blue like a pendulum, and even I was afraid that we might go in. It was pivoting back and forth, the ropes groaning like a ship's mast in a high wind, and I wondered for a moment what it would be like to fall into that blue water. You could only really tread water for so long before you went under, and I wondered how long that would be. Would anyone get back with help before I drowned?  
  
I didn’t see it when Catherine fell off the bridge, but when Henry yelled out a moment later, I looked over and saw her when she hit The Blue. She didn’t splash, the water just staying put, and she came up thrashing as she tried to get her head above the crystal blue surface. The water must’ve been thick because she was really struggling to make any headway in it. She was calling for help with big, gasping breaths. The bridge had stopped moving, all five of us looking down into the chasm and knowing that we were in trouble. We had been playing where we shouldn't, we had been being stupid, and now someone had gotten hurt.   
  
“We've gotta get help,” Daniel yelled, and his words were like a starter pistol.  
  
I ran for the cabin to try and get help, Daniel and Carter coming with me. I prayed Catherine could tread water while we ran the twenty or so minutes back to the cabin, but I knew that Catherine wasn’t a strong swimmer. I didn’t expect she would still be treading water by the time we came back, but I prayed to God that she would be. Mom, Aunt Clair, and Aunt Liz were at the table when we ran in, drinking tea and laughing, but they jumped up when we told them what had happened. Mom came running, grabbing a rope and running along behind us, as we went back. My dad and uncles still weren’t back from fishing, but Aunt Liz said she would call emergency services to hopefully get someone down here. The run back took a little longer, all of us winded from the sprint to the cabin, but Catherine had only been in the water forty-five minutes by the time we got back. That wasn't so long, I thought. She could still be fine.  
  
It was forty-five minutes too long, though.  
  
Clint said she had gone under about five minutes after we left and she hadn’t come back up since. My mom tied the rope off to a tree, but it was too short to make it down to The Blue. She went back for another rope, my Aunt staying with us, and by the time she got back, she had emergency services in tow. They brought longer ropes and divers, and soon they were in The Blue trying to find her. The divers who went in said The Blue was miles deep, and the water was like trying to swim in Jell-O. They went as deep as they dared, but they never found Catherine. My Dad and Uncles came back from fishing to find my mother inconsolable and Catherine presumed dead. They didn’t have the heart to punish us for what happened, and all of us said it had been a terrible accident. We left out the part where we had been rocking the bridge, and they decided that Catherine must’ve just lost her balance and fallen in. They shouted a little that they had told us to stay away from The Blue, but they could see how shaken up we were by what had happened.  
  
They thought we had been punished sufficiently, but it appeared that something else disagreed.  
  
We never went back to Grandpa‘s cabin again. It held bad memories for all three of us, and I don’t think any of Dad's siblings went back either. None of my cousins went there willingly again. It held terrible memories for all of us, and I think that we knew something dark was waiting for us to come back.  
  
The first letter showed up two weeks after Catherine’s funeral.  
  
The two weeks after we buried my sister were a really bad time for me. I was sad about what had happened to Catherine, but I was also unbelievably riddled with guilt over it. I felt that I had every right to be guilty, I had played a part in what had happened, but I didn’t think I had been the biggest part. Looking back, my cousins were really the ones who had pushed her to get on the bridge, but I hadn’t stood up and tried to protect her. I had failed in my duties as a big brother, and she had paid the price.  
  
My parents had been talking about back-to-school shopping, something they seemed unwilling to do, and my mother was trying to guilt my father into getting it done. They were both distraught over the loss of Catherine, but my mother had always been a bit of a realist when it came to things. My sister was dead, but I would still have to start school whether I wanted to or not and I would need things to begin school with. While they argued about it, Mom told me to go get the mail and see if the circular had come yet. I think she wanted coupons out of it, but I can’t really remember.  
  
I would find it hard to remember much about that day when I looked back, except for the letter.  
  
I went out to the mailbox and found that there was a circular in there. There were also two bills, a couple of condolence cards, and a letter in a strange envelope. The envelope felt moist, the paper, seeming damp and moldy, and I didn’t like touching it. I started to sandwich it between the condolence cards, and that’s when I noticed it had my name on it.  
  
From Catherine Mansley to Justin Mansley  
  
I felt the other pieces of mail slip through my fingers when I read the name. It couldn’t be. Catherine was dead, dragged into The Blue by whatever lay below, and there was no way this letter was from her. I thought it might be a trick from one of my cousins, but they had all seemed as Guilty about what happened to Catherine as I was. Clint hid it behind a constant stream of humor, but he still clearly felt like we needed to hide what they had done. Like me, he realized that we would get in trouble if they knew that we had been goofing around and I didn’t think he would be stupid enough to try to pull something like this.  
  
I opened the strange envelope. I didn’t want to. I wanted to throw it away, but I had to know what was inside. Even at twelve, I knew there was no way this could be from Catherine. Dead people did not send letters to the living, but I still had to know what was going on here.  
  
The letter was brief.  
  
All of Catherine’s letters have been brief.  
  
It’s your fault, you should be the one in The Blue.  
  
I just stood there for a moment, looking at the letter. I started to rip it up, thinking again that this was a cruel joke, but something stopped me. It isn’t something I can really explain, but tearing that paper felt like tearing the page out of the Bible. It just felt fundamentally wrong, and I ended up stuffing it into my pocket instead as I collected up the mail that I dropped on the pavement. I couldn’t destroy it, but I didn’t want my parents to find it either. What would they say if they saw it? Would they know what I had done? I couldn’t risk that. I was in enough turmoil over my sister’s death without my parents blaming me for it.  
  
I came in and dropped off the mail, sneaking back up to my room as I hid the letter in a box of baseball cards under my bed.  
  
It wouldn’t be the only one soon enough.  
  
Over the next two months, I got two more letters, each on the same day of the month. After the second one, coming about two weeks after school started, I started checking the mail every day to make sure the letter didn’t get picked up by my parents. I hid them in the same box, each of them reading similar to the one before it.  
  
I’m lonely.  
  
I miss you.  
  
It’s your fault.  
  
Come to The Blue.  
  
Come to The Blue.  
  
Come to The Blue.  
  
It was October, the leaves already a vibrant orange in the front yard, when Clint called me after I received my third letter.  
  
“Are you doing this?” he asked, sounding scared and angry.  
  
It sounded like he was shaking something in the background, paper or something, and I asked him what he was talking about.  
  
“These letters. Carter and I have each gotten three. If this is you, you need to stop. We all feel bad about what happened to Catherine, me especially, but this is going to get us in trouble. If one of our parents found those letters then we could be in serious trouble for what we did. Your sister is gone man, and I’m sorry for it, but this isn’t gonna bring her back.“  
  
I knew what he was talking about without having to be told. I told him I had been receiving them too, and that I bet Henry and Daniel had been getting them as well. I still didn’t think they were from Catherine, there was no way for dead people to write you letters, but somebody clearly knew what we had done in the woods. Clint said that was impossible. We had been the only ones in the woods that day, or at least the only ones around The Blue when Catherine had fallen in. He said it had to be one of us, and before he hung up he said he was going to call Daniel and see if it was one of them playing a bad joke.  
  
He called me back twenty minutes later and said they were just as freaked out as he was.  
  
“He says he’s been dreaming about The Blue, and he knows that Henry has too. Henry is talking about The Blue a lot these days and Daniel is scared that he’s going to tell somebody what really happened."  
  
I hadn’t thought of that either, but I suppose by then I thought it might be what we deserved.  
  
The letters kept coming on the same day every month, and I realized that it was the same day that Catherine had gone into The Blue. We all received our letters on the anniversary of her fall, and as Christmas came around we all started to worry about Henry. Henry had always been a big boy, looking like a high schooler even though he was a year younger than Daniel, but when he came to our house for Christmas, he looked like he had lost about thirty pounds. It also looks like he might’ve been pulling out his hair. He was twitchy, quiet, and nothing like the boisterous boy had been a few months ago. Daniel told us that when he talked, it was about The Blue. He said he dreamed about it, drew pictures of it, and in the pictures, Catherine was floating in it. Henry and Clint had been the last ones to see her alive in all that blue, but in the pictures, she was waving at them from the water.  
  
“He says that in his dreams, she comes out of The Blue and tries to get him to jump in. She told him that it’s nice down there, that it’s cool and wonderful, and that he would really enjoy it if you were to join her. He keeps talking about joining her, but I don’t know how we would. Dad told Mom that we were never going back to the cabin, not after what had happened. They’re all really afraid that one of us will fall off that bridge if they went back." Daniel told us as we sat at the kid's table in the den.  
  
Henry sat at the table with us, but he did little more than move his fork around in his mashed potatoes, not really eating anything.  
  
A couple of months later, my aunt and uncle put Henry in a psychiatric facility. Dad told us he was sick, but Daniel said he'd started having night terrors and he'd almost completely stopped eating. He couldn't go to school, he wouldn't play, and it was like he'd just shut down completely. Daniel was afraid to sleep in the same room with him, and he really hoped that whatever this place was they had taken Henry to, they would fix him.  
  
A month after that, Henry broke out of that facility and was never seen again.  
  
No one was quite sure how he had gotten out without being seen, but Henry was gone.   
  
Everything in the room was exactly the way it had been the night before, including the restraints that were still buckled in the same way they had been when the orderly had put him to bed. The police thought for sure they would find him walking along the road or something, maybe in the woods around the place, but they never did. Uncle Mike and Aunt Liz were devastated, but the four of us were pretty sure we knew where Henry was. They would never find him, just like they’d never found Catherine. We were all pretty sure that he was in The Blue. The facility they put him in was about thirty miles from Grandpa‘s cabin, but we were still certain that’s where he was.  
  
When I got my letter that month all my questions were answered.  
  
Henry came to join me in The Blue. You should all come and see him. He’s much better now.  
  
Daniel and Clint called me later that day, and I told them I had gotten the same news.  
  
“What are we gonna do?” Clint asked.  
  
I didn't have an answer.  
  
Carter went next, though it took him two years to do it.  
  
Carter was about two years younger than Clint, the youngest of the cousins besides Catherine, and he held out only because he and Clint were so close. I don’t think Clint‘s parents ever had any inkling of what was going on with their son, but by Thanksgiving, he was looking the same way Henry had. He was barely eating, and only then because Clint coaxed him. Clint had changed since that summer when we lost Catherine. He had softened a little, and I think he had realized that life was a little more fleeting than he had believed. He said Carter wasn’t sleeping, was having nightmares about The Blue, and told Clint that Henry was in the dreams too. Carter was smarter than the rest of us, not that this was saying much, but I think it helped him put off the bad feelings and get through it for a while. Unlike Henry, Carter just looked tired all the time, and when he came to my fourteenth birthday that year, the bags under his eyes looked like bruises.  
  
“It's not as bad as it looks,” he told me with a faint smile, “My parents sent me to a doctor who got me some meds that help. Well, not really help, but they let me sleep. They make it harder to get out of the dreams, though.”  
  
I asked him about the dreams, and despite Clint telling me not to make him think about them, Carter said he didn't mind. Daniel and I sat close, like students listening to a lecture, and Carter reeled a bit as he thought about it, not seeming sure where to begin.  
  
“I'm standing on the bridge. It's nighttime, it's always nighttime in the dreams, and I'm looking down into The Blue. It's,” he blinked really fast for a few seconds and shook his head before going on, “It's glowing in the dreams. It's always glowing. As I stand and look down, Catherine and Henry come up out of the water and wave at me. They tell me to jump. They tell me to join them. They tell me how great it is down there. As they tell me, I kind of want to jump. I,” his eyes shut for a count of five before he jerked awake with a start, “I want to go to them. There are no dreams in The Blue, no nightmares or letters or anything. It's just peaceful.”  
  
He leaned over onto Clint and started snoring, and Clint accepted his weight gratefully.  
  
Carter nearly made it to my fifteenth birthday party, and a lot of that was due to Clint.  
  
This whole thing brought us all closer together, and we called each other often. Daniel actually came to live with us for a while, his parents having trouble coping with Henry's disappearance. Aunt Liz was eventually put into the same facility Henry escaped from after she tried to overdose on sleeping pills, and Uncle Mike soon moved in with us too. He and Daniel looked sad most of the time, but I think they enjoyed having us close.  
  
Daniel had started having the dreams a lot more often, but he was fifteen and starting high school, and he had other things to occupy his mind. If there was anyone who could have used our help, it was Clint. Clint had started high school too, he and Daniel were a year older than me, but he missed a lot of days while he tried to take care of Carter. Carter was losing his mind at an alarming rate, and Clint confided that he had started strapping him into the bed at night.  
  
“I've caught him sleepwalking to the front door, and he fights me when I try to get him back to bed. I don't know how my mom and dad haven't noticed yet, but I may have to tell them soon. He's like a zombie, and I don't know how he makes it through school every day.”  
  
A week before my fifteenth birthday, Aunt Claire called us to tell us that Carter and Clint had gone missing.   
  
“They both disappeared in the middle of the night.” she said tearfully, “And I just don't know what to do. The police have no idea, but I was hoping that maybe they had gone to your house for some reason and they were safe.”  
  
My mom said they hadn't, but she and Dad said they would help her look for them.  
  
“Clint's bike is gone too. I told Dale that Indian Scout was a bad idea, but he swore Clint was responsible and that he wouldn't just up and leave without telling us.”  
  
Daniel and I were eavesdropping, and he said we both knew where they were.   
  
After my parents left to join the search party, we piled into Daniel's Jeep and went to Grandpa's cabin, as little as we wanted to. Uncle Mike had left him the Jeep when he got his driver's license, but this would be the longest trip we had made in it. Grandpa's cabin was about two hours from my house, and despite having left a note, I was sure my mother would be worried sick. The drive seemed to take forever, but when we pulled up in front of the cabin and found Clint's motorcycle out front, we knew what we would find.  
  
It was dark when we got to The Blue, and Clint was kneeling on the ground as if he were praying.   
  
The dirt beneath his forehead had turned to mud, and he didn't even look up when we approached.   
  
“I didn't catch him in time.” Clint said through tears, “I didn't wake up until the sun was nearly up, and by then it was too late. He beat me here by minutes, though I don't know how. I tried to catch him, but he was already standing on the edge when I arrived. I begged him to come back, but he just pitched over and went into The Blue. He was right,” he said, pointing, “It glows at night.”  
  
I hadn't even noticed, but as I looked up, I could see it now. The Blue was glowing like the iridescent moss you sometimes found in caves, and as I looked down, I thought I saw three figures swimming within it. They were looking up at me, but I leaned away before they could entice me over.  
  
“Clint,” Daniel said, but he didn't respond, “Clint, we need to go.”  
  
“Go?” Clint asked, not seeming sure of what he was talking about.  
  
“Yeah, we need to go. It's too late for Carter, but your mother is worried sick about you. Aunt Claire thinks you and your brother have been kidnapped, maybe even that the same person got you who got Henry. Let's go back,” he coaxed, “Let's go back before something happens.”  
  
“Something already happened,” Clint said, his voice husky, “Carter's gone, Henry's gone, and I'm tired of living with these dreams every night. They aren't going to stop until we all go in, and I'm tired of fighting it.”  
  
“What are you,” Daniel started, but Clint had stood and sprinted for the lip of the drop before we could stop him. Daniel made a grab for him but missed him completely. We both stepped after him, trying to catch him, but he was over the edge before we could even process what had happened. He didn't splash when he went in, just like Catherine hadn't, and Daniel and I stood there breathing heavily as we watched the still surface of The Blue.  
  
When he didn't surface, we walked back to the cabin with only the moon to guide us and called our parents.  
  
As emergency services came out to dive into The Blue again, Daniel and I just sat there in shock.  
  
“We've got to get some distance from this,” Daniel said, “Maybe if we go where she can't find us, the dreams will stop and we can avoid the same fate that the others did.”  
  
I asked him if he believed that, and all he could say was it was worth a shot.  
  
They sold the cabin after that. My Aunt Claire and Uncle Dale had lost both of their children in one night, and they took it pretty hard. Daniel and I helped each other through the next few years, but when Daniel graduated and said he was taking a job overseas, I could tell that the dreams were starting to get to him. I had kept my grades up, using the sleepless nights to study, and was eligible for early graduation. I had been accepted into a college three states away, something that broke my mother's heart, and Daniel wished me luck.   
  
For the next three years, we just kind of maintained. The dreams got better with distance, and soon I stopped having them all together. Daniel told me the same and built a life for himself in South America. After three years, I almost forgot about the dreams and The Blue, just choking it up to something remembered wrong from childhood, and as I got closer and closer to graduating, I couldn't wait to start my new life.  
  
Then, Aunt Liz had died, and Uncle Mike had begged Daniel to come back.  
  
Aunt Liz had died of a stroke in her bed, having left the facility years ago, and Uncle Mike was a mess. He had never really gotten over the loss of Henry, and he begged Daniel to come back and help him. Daniel had agreed to come back to help with the funeral preparations but then said he had to go back. He invited Uncle Mike to go back with him, saying he could stay with him in South America, but he doubted he would.  
  
“It's only for a couple of weeks, a month tops. I'll be fine,” he assured me.  
  
Now he was gone too.  
  
As I sit here on the floor, typing this out, I can hear something I haven't in three years.  
  
The Blue is calling again, Catherine is calling again, and I don't know how long I can hold out.  
  
Sooner or later, I'll go join the rest of them.  
  
Sooner or later, I'll return to The Blue.  
  
The old guilt is still there, it's always been there, and I was a fool to think I could run from it.  
  
I should have saved myself the trouble and jumped the night Clint went in.  
  
Now I'm the last, and it's only a matter of time before Catherine gets me too.
