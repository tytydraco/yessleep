I don’t even remember how I got here. All I know is that being trapped down here has been like living a waking nightmare.

I’m going to try to recount the past couple days to the best of my memory, but it’s so hard to focus with my mind so clouded by adrenaline. Everything has just been so hazy since then.

I guess it started a few days ago, I think. It’s been hard to keep track of time with no windows or anything. All I really know for certain is that I woke up here in this little wire dog kennel and have been stuck here since.

My movement is severely restricted. It’s spacious enough that I can just barely shuffle and adjust myself, but my muscles ache and my legs are numb from being constricted in such an unnatural state. A tight chain collar sits uncomfortably around my neck, a consistent tugging creating a permanent, choking ache, like it must be leashed to the top of the kennel.

I don’t remember how I actually got here. One moment I was laying on my bed at home, then the next moment I was staring at the iron bars of my cage, cold metal digging a grid pattern into my contorted body. I couldn’t really process anything that was happening at first, I must have been given some extreme sedative because of how out of it I was.

My head thumped like a jackhammer, causing the room to spin around through my obscured vision. A thin, torn blanket laid beneath me, protecting me from the otherwise dirt-covered floor beneath my kennel. A small desk sat next to my cage. The monitor of an old, boxy, computer casted a dim light over the otherwise pitch-black room. I seemed to be in an unfinished basement, a large workbench and lazily strewn tile in the corner made it look like someone might have cared to work on it more at some point.

A violent slam rang out from the door at the top of the stairs. The stairs began to creak, and that’s when I met my captor.

He lumbered down the stairs, heavy breaths wheezing from his throat with each step. He waddled gracelessly towards me with a hunger in his eyes. A bucket swayed in his hand, the weight of it forcing him into an unnatural lean as he came closer. Sweat glistened on the folds that spilled out the sides of his stained tank top.

“Hey, pretty boy. Glad to see you’re awake.” He flashed a yellow grin at me. The bucket sloshed as it met the floor, the man turning to grab a small glass bowl from the workbench. “Are you thirsty, pet?”

A sound vaguely resembling *yes* left my throat as I fought against my collar to shuffle closer to the bars. He smiled at me once more, seemingly satisfied with my plea. He leaned over and dipped the bowl into the bucket, his grease-slick hair falling in front of his face. Turning to me, he kneeled down to my eye level and unlocked my cage.

“Drink up, princess,” the man’s breath blew hot air onto my face. He pushed the bowl straight up to my lips and began pouring, giving me no option but to open my mouth and savor every drop. What started as a strange, earthy aftertaste quickly turned into clumps of dirt and mud mixed into each drop of water.

I began to spit, to try resisting, but he then grabbed me by my jaw and forced open my mouth with his meaty hands. The cool steel cut into my throat as he pulled me, forcing me to choke and cough. Clumps of soft mud fell on my tongue.

“Swallow. Now.” He growled out the words, nostrils flaring, staring at me more like an animal than a man. “Eat.”

Tears welled in my eyes as I accepted there would be no use in arguing. I forced myself to swallow, clusters and specks of rough dirt tearing up my esophagus as it painstakingly made its way down my throat. Through my tear-streaked vision the man looked overjoyed, a crazed smile much bigger than before adorning his face.

“Good boy,” he cooed, dragging his other mitten of a hand through my hair. “Are you still hungry?” He didn’t wait for a response before lifting the glass and forcing more down my throat.

The cycle continued throughout that first day; he would fill the bowl, I would lap up any bit of water possible, and then the mud would be force fed to me until I vomited.

That night, the man slept at the desk next to me. He tapped away at the large computer, loudly watching videos and making comments on various things he saw online. When the content made him angry, he would take it out on me by kicking and thrashing my kennel violently.

It's the same computer I'm writing this on now, days later. 

I tried to get some sleep that night, but the sound of constant shuffling and his chair squeaking made it impossible when he wasn’t focused on me. I felt so weak from vomiting and only stomaching a bit of mud. I just hoped that the next day he would give me a [proper meal](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilkTeaDevotee/).
