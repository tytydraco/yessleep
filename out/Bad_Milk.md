Chris woke up to the blaring sound of his alarm and a splitting headache. He sat up in bed wincing, closing his eyes from the sunlight flooding into the room. Blindly he reached out toward his nightstand slapping around till his hand found the snooze button on his alarm. Squinting at the alarm clock, the red lights blinked 8:00 AM. He didn’t remember setting the alarm last night, and eight in the morning was too optimistic even not hungover. Pulling his blanket back over his head he laid down trying to go to sleep.

The darkness didn’t help; it only made him realize how badly he needed to go to pee. Stepping out of bed his foot crushed down on a beer that wrapped itself around his foot. He kicked with his foot trying to shake the can free. As the can shook it sprayed the leftover contents around the room. Chris used his hand to pry the can off his foot, dropping it back on the floor as he rushed to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom, he didn't notice the spill the can had made as the rest of its contents soaked into the carpet.

Stepping into the bathroom he was hit by the stench of day-old vomit. The smell made him gag, almost adding to the pile he saw clogging his sink. Wearing a disgusted expression Chris wondered who had thrown up into his sink last night. Whoever it was would have to clean it up, because he wasn’t about to take on cleaning today. In fact, he wasn’t about to clean any other day either. No one had cleaned the bathroom in months. A glance around the bathroom would have revealed mold and mildew in every nook and cranny and a yellow bathmat that was once white.

While at a glance the bathroom looked dingy it became unquestionably hazardous when Chris opened the lid to the toilet. Looking down into the bowl the inside was covered in a brown fuzz resembling a sea anemone floating in the ocean. The disturbingly unkempt toilet might have made scientists question whether the four roommates had succeeded in creating a new lifeform. Spawned by a regiment of protein shakes and incubated in a toilet that hadn’t seen cleaning products in two years.

The sight didn’t faze Chris in fact he barely glanced down as he pulled his boxers down to pee that morning. Once he finished, he ran his hands under the cold water from the faucet splashing some of it on his face in an attempt to wake himself up. Still in a daze he shambled back to his room to get dressed.

Besides a few patches of bare carpet most of the floor in Chris’ room was covered in piles of dirty clothes. Looking around the various piles he found a pair of jeans and a T-shirt that he thought looked clean enough. At least he couldn’t see any visible stains on them. He brought the T-shirt up to his face giving it a sniff. It had a slight odor to it, but since he wasn’t going into class today, he figured it was good enough.

With his head still reeling from last night he lethargically got dressed. Still wondering if he should just get back to bed. It felt like he had missed his chance though. He was already up, and his growling stomach wasn’t going to let him get back to sleep. Chris headed towards the apartment kitchen wondering if he was the first one up. Passing by Ricky’s room he knew it was too quiet for him to be awake yet. Ricky was somehow always lively in the mornings.

Rounding the corner into the living room he got a look at the aftermath from the party last night. Dozens of questionably empty cans and bottles were scattered everywhere across the tables and floor. The stockpile of liquor they had were now empty and cluttered across the coffee table. Looking at the TV he was shocked to see a firefighter’s axe buried in the middle of it. Seeing it didn’t help jog any memories from the previous night. He just chuckled to himself thinking it must have been some wild night. 

His growling stomach pulled his attention back to the kitchen. Still feeling the hangover from last night, he needed to make some eggs. Ever since parties in high school his older brother had told him eggs cooked in soy sauce were the best hangover cure. Regardless of whether it really worked or not Chris began to swear by it over the years making it his morning ritual after nights of heavy drinking.

Pilling up in the kitchen sink was the apartment's collection of all the pans caked with remnants of food. The last time Chris could even remember one of his roommates cooking was two weeks ago. For a brief moment he thought about cleaning one of the pans in pursuit of his hangover cure, but decided it was too much work. Instead, he grabbed a bowl and a box of cereal sitting on top of the refrigerator. It wasn’t ideal but it would have to do for now.

He opened the refrigerator looking for milk but couldn’t find any.  He had sworn there was a half-gallon in there yesterday. Taking a second look around the apartment he saw the carton of milk sitting out behind the pile of liquor bottles. Chris let out an annoyed sigh, Dan, must have been using it for white Russians again. He picked up the container, sniffing it to see if it was still usable. The rancid sour smell punched him in the nose.

Moving back to the kitchen he went to toss out the bad milk, but the garbage can was full. It had actually been well over full for a week now. Pizza boxes, old, microwaved meals, and beer bottles now formed a precarious tower pilling up from the trash can. Chris delicately balanced the milk carton on top of the pile of trash. It had become a game of Jenga his roommates all played to avoid taking out the trash. All of them would pile the trash as high as they could until it inevitably tumbled down. Whoever caused the pile to crash had to take out the trash.

 

The cardboard milk container sat delicately atop the pile. Chris loudly clapped his hand together in celebration. Quickly regretting it when it aggravated his own headache. Not a moment later Dan came out of his bedroom.

“What are you clapping for this early bro.”

“Cause I’m not the one who’s taking out the trash from the party”, Chris said with a smug smile.

“Might want to check on that one again”, Dan said pointing behind him at the now toppled over pile of garbage.

Chris turned around to see the spilled pile of trash covering the kitchen floor. Dan went over sprawling out on the couch, “Chris you better get that milk cleaned up I can smell it from here.” Chris looked around the kitchen confused. The one thing he didn’t see scattered across the floor was the carton of milk. The smell was unmistakable though. Anywhere Chris moved he could smell the thick stench of rotten milk.

“Dan, you got to help me find that smell.”

“No way man I’m not the one who toppled the trash.”

“No, you're the guy who probably spilled milk everywhere making his white russians!”

“And you're the guy who invited Becky over. You know crazy Becky the “witch” who tried to summon a demon with a YouTube video until Ricky put the axe through our TV. “

 

Mike came out of the bedroom yawning, “it’s too early for everyone to be this loud. What are you all yelling about anyway?” We can’t find where that milk smell is coming from. Mike pointed behind the couch, “you geniuses think maybe it's the milk carton behind the couch” Chris and Dan both erupted back into arguing about who should clean up the milk. Mike ignored them both walking behind the couch to pick up the milk carton. As he bent over to pick it up the milk carton opened a set of red eyes looking back at him. Two small legs and a tiny set of arms popped out from the carton as it dashed away from Mike.  He let out a scream and the milk carton began to run around the living room sloshing spoiled milk out from its open top.

“What the hell is that thing.”

“Grab it dude.”

All three of the roommates raced around the room chasing the milk carton trying to grab it. The milk carton nimbly avoided their grabs diving under the coffee table and around the couch. The three of them circled up to surround the Milk.  Mike lunged forward, the Milk dashed backwards moving right back towards Dan and Chris. Dan quickly reached out, snatching up the Milk carton by the top flap.

Dan dangled the milk carton in the air, shaking it by the top flap as it flailed its tiny limbs.

Mike laughed at the sight of it flailing around, “It’s kinda cute.”

Chris looked uneasy, “What do you think that this is?

“Maybe Becky actually summoned the milk demon last night” Dan said laughing poking at it with his finger. The milk container hinged in half revealing a sharp set or cardboard teeth. The razor-sharp teeth snapped down on Dan's finger severing it off. Dan screamed out dropping the Milk carton back to the floor and began clutching his hand. Despite his tight grip, blood began gushing out. 

“Chris get a towel” Mike shouted at him. Chris stood dazed in horror watching the blood run down Dan’s arm. Seeing him locked up Mike pushed him out of the way running toward the bathroom to get a towel. In the panic no one saw where the Milk carton disappeared to. Mike came running back in handing Dan a towel. Dan buried his shaking bloody hand in the towel. Mike spun around looking around the room and back at Chris who was still in shock. “Where did that thing go?” Grabbing Chris by the shoulders he shook him repeating the questions. Chris stuttered back, “I.. I... don’t know. I lost track of it.

 

Ricky opened his door yawning as he leaned his head into the hallway. “How are you all up this early?” He walked out into the hall letting out an even bigger yawn as he walked by the group. Mike grabbed him by the shoulder to stop him from going out into the living room. “There's a demon in the apartment” Ricky brushed his hand aside as he walked over to the couch. “I know it's early guys but I'm not that gullible. You all have been spending too much time with Becky.”

 

Ricky sat down in his boxers putting his feet up on the cluttered coffee table. The smell of rancid milk wafted out from behind the couch.  He sniffed the air making a sour face, “aww which one of you guys was that I can smell it all the way over here.” They all shouted at once trying to warn Ricky about the milk carton, but he couldn’t understand anyone as they shouted over one another. In the chaos of the shouting, they couldn’t hear the milk carton clawing its way up the back of the couch and creeping its way towards Ricky. It stood on the back of the couch staring at Ricky with a dull expression. Out of the corner of his eye Ricky saw something moving and turned to look. “Whoa I think I’m still tripping guys, you seeing this little guys too?” The milk let out a hiss as it hinged in half and opened its mouth wide, presenting its set of razor teeth.

 

It sprang forward at Ricky biting him across the neck. Ricky screamed out in pain, but the shout only lasted a moment. His scream turned into a hideous gurgling noise as blood ran down his throat. His hands pulled at the milk carton trying to rip it away, but he couldn’t pry it off. His effort didn’t last long. Before anyone could react, his arms and head fell to the side going limp. The milk turned back towards the other three roommates hissing at them with blood dripping from its mouth.

 

The blood and hiss sent Chris into a panic. He ran back towards his room tripping on his own feet. Pushing himself back up off the ground he dove the last few feet into his room as if the monster was chasing right behind him.  Chris grabbed a hold of his door to slam it, but Dan was right behind him toward the room. “Get in here” Chris shouted slamming the door behind Dan. “Mike is still out there” Dan shouted trying to pull open the door, but Chris leaned against the door keeping it shut. “That thing killed Ricky we can’t go back out there.”

 

In the living room Mike darted over to the TV yanking out the axe that was buried in the screen. He yelled out running with the axe ready to strike towards the milk carton. The carton turned back looking towards him letting out another evil hiss. With all his strength he swung the axe down at the milk carton, but it was too fast dodging out of the way. The axe came down hard, wedging itself deep into the back of the couch. Mike pulled on the axe, but it wouldn’t budge. Sharp claws formed at the end of the milk cartons stubby arms as it rushed towards Mike. It nimbly ran across the axe handle charging at him. Mike pulled his hands away from the axe bringing them up to protect his face as the milk carton launched itself at him. The milk carton swung its claws scratching at Mike's face. Using his arms, he blocked most of the scratches except for one catching him right above his left eyebrow.

 

Blood from the scratch trickled down his face forcing him to close his left eye. He reached out trying to grab ahold of the milk carton to crush it, but felt a searing pain shoot down his left arm. The Milk carton had latched down with its razor teeth biting into his forearm. Mike violently shook his arm trying to shake the milk carton off. Blood started pouring down his forearm. The more he shook his arm the tighter the jaws snapped down and the more blood sprayed across the living room. With the milk container clamped down on his arm he slammed it against the back of the couch hoping to shake it off. Still latching on the milk container let out a deep growl back at him. He moved to the coffee table trying to hit it against anything he could find to make it let go. Each time he slammed his arm against something he could feel the impact and shock.

 

After a few more swings hitting the milk against the coffee table he slowed down. He started to feel woozy and light headed from the blood loss. With his arm throbbing he couldn’t bear to hit it much more. His legs started to wobble and buckle. Reaching out he held himself up against the coffee table, and with his last bit of energy he slammed his arm into one of the liquor bottles lying on the table. Glass shards punctured into the milk carton as the glass exploded around the room. Mike fought to maintain his balance but fell to the ground with a thud clipping his head on the coffee table.

 

In the bedroom Chris and Dan heard the booming thud. “Do you think he got it?” Chris said, looking over at Dan. He ignored the question sitting slumped over and staring at the floor. His face had turned a ghostly pale and his hand was still clutching the bathroom towel. The white bath towel was now almost completely red drenched in blood. Chris started pacing back and forth in his tiny room, “We gotta get out of here.. Or maybe call for help”  Chris kicked his bed frame in frustration, “My phone is out there in the living room”. Dan looked back mumbling but Chris couldn’t understand

 

As the two waited in the room trying to plan their next move, they heard a strange sound. Something was scraping along the carpet floor being dragged towards the room. “Mike?” Chris asked, but he could tell from the growing stench what was approaching. The rotten smell of milk had gotten even stronger as it seeped into his room.

 

A loud slam shook the door in its frame. Chris quickly locked the door quietly moving back away to his bed. He looked over to Dan who had gone limp and passed out on the floor. The loud crack knock at the door again even louder this time. Something was striking the middle of the door, but the milk carton should have been too small to reach. For a moment Chris wondered if maybe Mike really had taken care of the milk container.

 

With hesitation he slowly stepped back towards the door reaching out for the handle. When he reached out the edge of the fire axe came smashing through the door.  Chris jerked his hand back to avoid the splinters shooting out. Looking down through the small hole in his door he could see the milk carton looking back with its evil red eyes holding the axe. Small shards of glass were poking out of the milk container. Rancid milk seeped out of the glass wound soaking into the Carpet. Chris started to gag from the smell. He wondered how it had gotten so much worse in so little time.

The milk carton emitted a low growl at Chris menacingly gripping the handle of the axe. Seeing the tiny carton holding the axe he was sure there was no way it couldn't swing it. Ignoring the fact that the axe had already hit the door. The milk container whirled around lifting the axe straight up into the air and slamming it into the door.

 

Chris jumped back looking for anything in his room he might be able to defend himself with.

His eyes darted around from object to object. Laptop? no. Backpack? No even worse. Rum bottle? Good enough he thought, clutching the bottle in his hands. The fire axe cut through the door widening the hole into his room. The creature scrambled its way up to the door trying to force itself through the opening. Its clawed hands scratch and pulled on the sides of the hole tearing away wood splinters. Chunks of milk sloped off the milk carton as it struggled trying to force itself into Chris' room. Chris wildly swung the bottle trying to scare the creature back.

 

The Milk carton pulled away for a moment lining its mouth up with the hole in the middle of the door. With a gurgling noise it projectile vomited chunks of milk out at Chris. He tried to move out of the way but the milk rained down on him soaking his pants. Looking down at his pants he tried to brush away some milk with the bottle of rum, but he only rubbed the chunks of milk deeper into the fabric.

 

\*Ring\* \*Ring\*

Chris looked back up hearing the doorbell go off. He had only taken his eyes off the milk for a second, but he couldn’t see it through the opening anymore. Taking a cautious step forward he tilted his head trying to get a better angle to look through the hole in the door. He still couldn’t see the creature, but he could hear the sound of wet skittering steps moving back to the living room. He wondered if this was some elaborate trick.

 

After waiting a minute, the sound of the doorbell was replaced with a pounding at their front door.  (Who could be coming over this early? Did someone hear all the commotion and call for help). Cautiously Chris slowly opened the door tensing as it creaked. His eyes darted around looking for any sign of the milk carton. On the floor he saw puddles of milk leading back into the living room. He reached for the moist axe coated in milk pulling it out of his door.

 

The banging on the front door continued as he slowly made his way towards the living room. With each step his hands clenched tighter onto the axe ready to swing at any moment. Coming into the living room he saw the carton out of the corner of his eye. He turned immediately, swinging the axe as hard as he could. The axe cleaved an orange juice carton in half sending juice flying through the already filthy room.

 

Chris froze looking into the living room watching the juice scatter. Fear paralyzed him seeing Ricky and Mike lying dead on the floor. His knuckle turned white clutching the axe as tightly as he could. The banging on the door resumed causing Chris to almost jump out of his own skin. Terrified, he resumed his careful walk towards the apartment door. 

 

A familiar voice shouted through the door as the pounding continued. “Wake up guys it’s Becky I know I left my jacket there.” Chris sighed in relief letting himself relax for a split second, but tension quickly crept back in. If it was only Becky at the door, she wouldn’t be able to help them fight off the creature or save his roommate.

 

Chris spotted Becky’s jacket sitting on the corner of the couch. He quickly pulled the jacket away with the axe ready expecting to see the milk carton. But all he saw was the worn away fabric arm of the couch. His eyes kept darting around the room as he backed his way up towards the kitchen to the door. With his back leaned up against the door he felt around for the handle fumbling around with the jacket in his hand not daring to take his eyes off the hallway.

 

After what felt like a minute, he found the doorknob.  Swinging the door open he saw Becky standing there looking annoyed. Becky was wearing her black tank top and skirt from the night before. She stood staring Chris eye to eye thanks to her tall platform boots.  “What's with the axe?” She said, raising her eyebrows.

 

Chris fumbled for words shouting “yu..you have to get out of here”.  He shoved the black leather jacket at her trying to push her back. Becky grabbed the jacket back looking even more confused at Chris. As Chris went to slam the door, he heard the patter of tiny wet steps running up behind him. Spinning around he lifted the axe above his head bringing it smashing down onto the tile floor as the milk carton dashed by him.  It was making a break to run out of the apartment no longer caring about Chris or Becky.

 

Becky yelped, lifting her leg and bringing the platform boot smashing down on the milk carton. The carton crumpled under her heavy boot sending a spray of clumpy milk splattering out from the impact. Becky’s annoyed disposition now settled into anger looking at the rancid milk on her boots and jacket. “What the hell was that, Chris!? Ugh you are going to be getting the cleaning bill for my jacket.” Chris stood with a relieved smile on his face looking at the crumbled carton. “Yeah, sure Becky”. With a huff Becky stormed away trying to shake the bits of milk off her boots.

 

Chris closed the door, locking it behind himself and leaning the axe up against the door frame. Man, I could really use a drink. He walked over to the fridge reaching into the bottom shelf for a beer. The sound of eggs cracking caught his attention. As he looked up on the top shelf of the fridge the egg carton was staring back at him snarling. The egg carton opened up forming a mouth with two rows of sharp teeth as it dove out at Chris clamping down on his face. He fell backwards lying on the floor of the kitchen as he tried to swat the egg carton off. The swatting quickly stopped as he bled out onto the kitchen floor joining his roommates.
