It’s hard to sleep on nights you hate yourself.

I wasn’t going to just lie there all night listening to my own thoughts, looking at the ceiling without seeing it. So I grabbed my headphones and a beer from the fridge and headed out. 

This was a nice town to walk around in. The night air was cool, the streetlights were few and far between and the woods surrounded you on all sides. I was able to avoid attention and stick to the shadows as I passed between patches of a dull orange glow. Of course I was too distracted to notice what a nice night it was. I was focused on using the alcohol to hide my pain and the music to hide my thoughts.

Why am I me? Why do I have to live in this body? Why do I have to have this brain? The darkness surrounded me on all sides, from the street and my head. The music faded into nothingness as I consumed myself. Why did my parents give me life? All life has brought me is misery. Everyone I’ve ever known I’ve hurt. I hate them. I hate all of them. I hate myself.

I took a sip of my beer to reorient themself. No paper bag. There were no cops around to bother me. If one tried I think I would’ve clubbed him with the bottle. Give him a chance to shoot me. God I wish somebody would shoot me right now. 

There were those thoughts again. They always showed, if you gave them time to arrive. Of course no miracle cop or mugger was going to show up out of the blue to deliver me. If I wanted results, I had to be the one to deliver. My thoughts grew darker and I began to concentrate on a single, overwhelming thought. Would I be the one who killed myself?

A block ahead of me a deer emerged from the night. It paused under a streetlight and turned to look at me. I stared back. For a moment all was silent as I waited for the deer to cross. Instead it only stood still. Then I began to notice things. I thought at first maybe it was just the eerie orange glow of the streetlight. But no, it was the deer. Something about it just seemed off, but I couldn’t place what it was. I continued staring in bewilderment. In the back of my head a quiet feeling of unease emerged, overriding the misery consuming me. The longer I stared at the deer the feeling intensified. I felt myself tense, my breathing grew fast, the feeling of unease rose and rose until it became utter panic. There was something wrong with that deer.

The deer twitched. Slowly, labored, it began to rise. Its front hooves lifted off the ground. Its massive form shifted onto the skinny back legs. I began to hear popping, like the sound of buckling wood. Seconds later there was a loud crack as its right thigh bone split in half. The deer did not jolt or scream. Calmly, it glanced down at the now sideways leg and then back up at me. It stood, staring at me, balanced haphazardly on its one good leg. 

I began to sense a presence in my mind. In utter horror, I realized the creature was inside my head. Helplessly, I stood as it ripped me apart from the inside. It saw every experience, every emotion, every action that had led me to be here at this very moment.

Then it spoke. Three words. Its mouth did not move, but I heard its voice as clear as day inside my head. The voice was full of malice, with an unmistakable sense of glee. The voice of a predator who had cornered its prey. My head went blank as the only thing I felt was abject terror from those three words.

“Not you. Me.”
