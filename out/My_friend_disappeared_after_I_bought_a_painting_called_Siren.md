 I was so transfixed by the painting that I didn't even hear the vemdor talk to me. 


 "You like it don't you?" The old woman asks. I look at her dumbfounded like I was a kid that got caught shoplifting. "Um, yes, how much would you sell it for?" As soon as I said "sell" her eyes lit up. "$25 no more no less". 


 I shake my head. "That sounds like a reasonable price." I then handed the 25 bucks to her. 


 As she hurriedly ran back to the counter I took another glance at the painting. It has a small island with a palm tree on it. A woman leans against the small sandy shore as her feet reaches the water you see a mermaids tale in it. 


 When she reached the counter I went up and paid for it. She snatched up the money quick. "What is the name of this painting?" I asked her. She looked at me with shock in her eyes and a little bit of fear. "It's, it's called Siren". She then went back to putting the money in the cash register. 


 I went and picked the painting up. It ain't one of those big ones like you see in museums. No it's kind of small like the one you see above the Simpson's couch except a little bit bigger and wider. 


 As I left the flea market I look at my only purchase. To me the painting felt onminous and mystifying. I don't even know why I got it. This Will be the first piece of artwork I had ever put in my apartment. 


 On the drive home I set the painting in the backseat. I thought it would be distasteful to leave it in a dirty trunk. 


 I turned on the radio. As some song about a woman getting revenge on a man that cheated was playing I thought I heard something in car that made me turn it off. It was weird. I could've swore I heard a woman singing.


 The voice was beautiful. If only for a few seconds. I ain't never heard opera except in movies amd shows but it sounded like that. 


 I thought I must've had one in my head for me to be hearing it. As the painting was the only thing in the backseat and paintings can't sing.


 I finally make it to my apartment. I already knew the perfect place to put it. I was going to put it on the wall on top of my t.v. Few minutes up there and the sudden admiration hit me again. The woman on the beach looked so beautiful. The blonde red hair and her blue eye's. 


 I snapped out of it. Why am I fantasizing over a fictional woman? I then set down on my couch but my eye's still went back to that painting. 


 The waves crashing against that small island that she is on. I didn't even care about her tail. I just studied her. I jumled whwn my phone started ringing. I grabbed it and answered. "Hello?" I asked. "Um hey Sam, you mind if I stay over at your place for a couple of nights?" 


 I sat straight up. Laura. "Why do you need to come over?" I asked her even though I done know the answer. 


 "He…he beat me again." As soon as she said that I balled my fists. Laura is a kind and sweet person rand it kills me hearing that Daniel keeps on hitting her. "Yeah. Yeah grab your stuff and come over. I'll have you a place set up." 


 The phone hanged up. I put my hand on my head and sighed. I set my stuff from my bedroom and put then on the couch. As I was watching a movie a knock on the door made me turn it off. 


 I opened it up and let Laura in. She was crying and embraced me. I hugged her back and led her back to the couch. 


 "I don't understand it Sam." As she blows into some tissues. I just shook my head at her,"Laura people like Daniel are just assholes all right." She nods her head. "I just wanted him to change." She starts crying again. 


 I consoled her for a few minutes and led her to my bedroom."Where are you going to sleep?" She asks me. "I've slept on the couch more times than the bed Laura." She then smiled at me and went to the bed and laid down.


 I moved my things on the couch and laid down. As I laid I just stared at the painting. The woman flinging her blonde red hair against the war should be the type of woman Laura can be. No worries about wondering if your boyfriend is going to beat the shit against you the next day. Just swimming against the endless ocean waters. 


 I woke up several hours later to Lauren with her back in front of me. She was just standing there looking aimlessly at the painting. I got up and stood right beside her. She still had tears flowing down her eyes. 


 I put my hand on her shoulders. She jumped away from me but saw who I was. She then broke down again. "Why. Why do I stay with him Sam." I didn't have the answers for her. I wished I did. The woman on the beach looking at the waters just has a different view than the sad life Laura had. 


 "Hey listen to me," I tell her. "You need to over to your place, tell Daniel to get his stuff, and get out if your life". She nods her head at me.


 "Ok. Ok I'll do it, can you still just give me a couple of days first?" I nod my head. "Of course." 


 On them next couple of days were the longest for Laura. She called her parents. She tried to do whatever is fun for her and I went along. She's just prepping herself up. I thought to myself.


 Honestly if she would let me I would beat the Crap out of Daniel myself. But I don't want her to hate me because she is one of the few friends that I have that care about me. 


 I think about how her life would be different if she hadn't met him. Her smile brightening everyone's day as she walks and says hello. Her reading her fantasy books and watching her late night sitcoms. Life just seemed to harsh for her. At least it's harsh for everybody. 


 Lately though I had been seeing her stare at the painting. Honestly, I still stare at it. Sometimes I would stare at it with her as she holds my ha d and squeeze it. 


 "You think she is having a happy life?" She asks me. "Probably, I mean she looks happy". She shakes her head. "Sometimes whenever I'm asleep. I think I hear her singing to me." I look at her a little shocked. I thought I was the only one hearing the singing but if she hears it then I am not crazy. 


 "Maybe after I break up with him we should go to the beach?" 


 I smile at her. "Of course! We will stay as long as you want to!" She looks back at me with her eye's glowing and radiant. After that day in the morning I watched her leave the driveway. Wishing her the best. As she drove away I could've swore I heard the singing of the woman in the painting. 


 ********************************************


 Only she didn't come back. After going back to her house to speak with Daniel neighbors reported not seeing her leave the house since. They did see Daniel in and out several times. One time with a long black bag. 


 The detectives interrogated Daniel profusely. They found out that her body was dumped in the local river. A search was done and the body was eventually found by two teenage boys who were fishing in the area. Apparently after telling Daniel that she wanted to break up he got mad and hit her real hard on the side of the head. 


 She landing on the kitchen counter. She died from the impact. Scared Daniel went got the sack and put her in. Then he made the long drive to the lake and dumped her in it. He got sentenced for 10 years. It was a long trial. 


 I'm going to the beach now. I promised her after all. Only though I'm not going to be alone. As I got done packing and looked at the painting of the mermaid woman. 



 I smile. The singing doesn't bother me anymore. The painting had changed. What was a reddish blonde woman was now happy smiling Laura. Maybe soon I would be in the painting with her. Us holding hands on the sandy beach. Maybe laughing and playing with the fishes. The singing still continues from the painting. 


 The singing has become more fearful though. It's like Laura is coaxing me to keep going in the water and don't come out. Everytime I'm even near the beach i hear her singing. She doesn't even sound like she is far away. 


 I've tried getting rid of the painting. I've tried throwing it away but it was still on my wall the nect morning. I don't want to burn it incase Laura's ghost gets out and tries to get me. I'm just confused and need help.
