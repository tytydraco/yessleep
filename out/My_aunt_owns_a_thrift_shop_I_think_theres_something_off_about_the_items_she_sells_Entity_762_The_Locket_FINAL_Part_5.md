\---

I waited by the window for Kira to arrive.

The street/alleyway outside was completely empty. The concrete abomination of an apartment building across the way stared back at me. Most of the lights were off, but a few of them glowed yellow in the darkness. I wondered if the residents knew how close they were to an entire treasure trove of magical, and usually evil, artifacts. Like the equivalent of living next to a giant wasp’s nest, ready to break through at any time.

I checked the lock several times, but there was really no need. Even muggers stayed out of this alleyway. Like they somehow sensed the artifact’s presence.

A figure finally appeared around the corner. And, then… a second one behind it.

I squinted and unlocked the door.

“You brought *him?!”* I hissed as I ushered Kira and Elias inside.

“He caught me sneaking out. Said he’d tell Mom if I didn’t let him come along,” Kira replied, shooting Elias a look. “He’s too lame to have his own friends, so he has to blackmail me into taking him along.”

“That’s not true!” he protested, crossing his arms.

Normally I’d use this opportunity to roast him to all hell, but I wasn’t in the mood. “You know what? It wouldn’t hurt to have another set of eyes.”

Elias raised an eyebrow. “Really?” He glanced at me, then Kira. “Wow. This must be *really* serious, if you’re not making fun of me.”

“It is. She… she didn’t tell you?”

He shook his head.

I explained to him what I saw. Then I gestured them back to Aunt Gigi’s office. I handed a copy of the manual to each of them, then grabbed a sheet of paper and sketched out the necklace. “Look for something like this.”

“That looks like a dick,” Kira said.

“It’s a *heart.*” I drew over it again, so that one side of the heart was not longer than the other.

Then the three of us sat down and began paging through the manuals. “Hey, does your aunt have anything to eat in there?” Elias asked, gesturing to the fridge behind me.

“Maybe, but she keeps it locked,” I replied, gesturing to the bike lock on the handle. “She had this employee that kept stealing all her food, and she got really pissy about it. I think she fired her a few months ago. Hence the job opening,” I said with a flair of my hands.

“I mean, I respect that,” Kira said. “Kevin would always steal my yogurts at work. It fucking *sucked.* Never admitted to it, either. But I know it was him.”

“Yeah, I had this guy…” Elias started.

I frowned. We were, very quickly, derailing. “Come on, guys, let’s keep looking through the manual. I want to find out what’s going on. Maybe we can even get some sleep tonight.”

“Yes ma’am,” Kira said mockingly. I narrowed my eyes at her.

We were interrupted by a sharp knock sounded on the office door.

The three of us froze.

*Aunt Gigi?*

*Rap-tat-tat!* The knocking was accompanied by a heavy, metallic clanking sound. As if the person was… wearing chains?

I glanced at the gap underneath the door. The silhouettes of two legs. I swallowed.

“Let me in,” came a deep, resonating voice. A voice that was echoey and muffled at the same time, like it was coming through… *metal?*

I grabbed the manual and flipped through it.

*Oh.*

*Entity #512*

*Class I*

*Presentation: Entity #512 is a 215-pound suit of armor that stands at six feet, two inches tall. It is made of iron and carries an axe. The helmet completely encloses the head and neck, except for a narrow slit that is four inches long and a quarter inch wide at eye level. Heat scans show that the temperature inside the suit is 98.6\*F. However, an MRI of the suit produced a jumbled mess of organs and tissue, with no centralized brain, calling into doubt that #047 was once human. It is more likely to be mimic than human in nature.*

*Safety Precautions: #047 is considered a relatively harmless entity. No deaths have occurred from contact with #047. The entity activates and becomes mobile every night between three and four AM, Eastern Standard Time. It does not observe daylight savings time. It is not aggressive, however, it does seek out heat sources (such as humans and warm-blooded animals), possibly for companionship. #047 is clumsy with its axe; therefore, it is best to keep at least six feet away, or stay in a locked room until the hour has passed.*

*Recovery Procedures: Wait until 4:00 AM before getting within six feet of #047.*

*Origin: #047 was found in Western England in 1963.*

“That’s not creepy at all,” I whispered.

“Okay, so we should be safe in here. Right?” Elias asked, eyeing the door just as another set of knocks sounded.

“As long as the door holds,” I said, as the door rattled with each knock. I glanced at the clock on the wall—3:07 AM.

We had almost an hour to endure of a sentient suit of armor knocking on our door.

*Great.*

\*\*\*

“Is this it?”

I glanced over at the page Elias was pointing to. “Dude, that’s not even a locket,” I said.

“… Oh. I thought it was…”

I rolled my eyes and continued flipping through the book. #274, a fire poker that paralyzed those it stabbed. #352, a sentient bookshelf that absorbed all the information the books held. Sounded fun, honestly, and it was only a Class I. Maybe I could persuade Aunt Gigi to let me take it home.

*Aunt Gigi…*

A little pang went through me. How could she have so many secrets? What, exactly, was she hiding? I rubbed my forehead and flipped to the next page. And the next, and the next…

“Wait,” Kira said from across the table. “I think I found it.”

Her eyes were wide, and her mouth hung open. My heart dropped.

Elias and I ran over.

*Entity #762*

*Class II*

*Presentation: A heart-shaped gold locket strung on a thin chain, with a 1-carat peridot stone set in the front.*

*Safety Precautions: #762 does not present any direct danger. When worn, it has the ability to transform the physical likeness of the wearer. A personal effect must be kept inside the locket that contains intact DNA of the person (or animal) the wearer intends to look like.*

*Recovery Procedures: Removing the locket, or the personal effect inside the locket, will halt all effects of #047.*

*Origin: #047 was originally found in a pawn shop. It seemed no one suspected its true nature before it was picked up by \[REDACTED\] in 2006.*

My heart pounded in my chest.

“So she, she *looks* like Aunt Gigi,” I stuttered. “But… it’s not her.”

The air felt like lead. Every breath I took felt suffocating. *No wonder she was so easygoing, so okay with putting me in danger. She’d never been the most safety-conscious aunt, but I should have known. Should have known she’d never put me in any real danger.*

*How long had she* not *been Aunt Gigi?*

*Where was Aunt Gigi?*

*Was she—*

“What do we do now?” Kira asked.

I sat there, every sense thrumming with nervous energy, the knocks on the door like the pounding in my brain. Pulsing, pounding, thrumming, the entire world shimmering.

“We ambush her,” I said, finally. “As soon as she comes in, in the morning… we ambush her. Three against one.”

“Ambush her with what? We don’t have any weapons,” Elias said.

“Oh, but we do. We have an entire arsenal, right out there.” I glanced at the clock. “It’s almost four. We’ll flip through the manual, find what we can use.”

“Shouldn’t we… like… get the police involved or something?” Elias asked.

“We can. But they won’t believe in shapeshifting lockets, will they?” I asked.

“Maybe if they see it…” Kira replied.

“We’ll call them too. But we need to take the locket off her first. Or she’ll just convince them that she’s the real Aunt Gigi.”

The three of us glanced at each other.

“Okay,” Kira said, some conviction in her voice. At least I’d convinced someone. Smelly Elly was still staring at me skeptically, eyebrows raised. “We ride at dawn.”

“We ride at dawn,” I repeated.

\*\*\*

I hefted #274 (the fireplace poker) in my hands. Kira pushed the #411 (the rocking chair) up to the front door, tossing the *DO NOT SIT HERE* sign. According to the manual, it would trap anyone who sat there for days, possibly weeks. Elias held #987 (a pair of high heels that would force the wearer to always tell the truth.)

“There she is,” I whispered, as a figure stepped into the alleyway.

We held our breath as the key jangled in the lock. The doorknob turned—

I came down with the poker.

She dodged out of the way like a cat. Then she swiped at me, grabbing my head in her large, claw-like hands.

*“You little traitor,”* she whispered, her nails needling my cheeks. I felt warm blood drip down the side of my face.

“Help,” I choked.

Elias grabbed the poker out of my hands. After a second of back and forth, he got her. The tines pierced her in the arm like a fleshy bit of steak. She screamed.

Kira and I wrestled her into the rocking chair—although it wasn’t much of a wrestle at the end, as she was quickly paralyzing. Her stiff, half-paralyzed limbs flailed as she fell into the seat. As soon as her rump hit the wood, she stuck like glue. She tried to scrabble up—the curved wooden rockers rattled against the wooden floor—but she was trapped.

“What the—”

Elias bent down and yanked off her shoes. Peeled off her socks. Stuffed her feet into the tattered, cracked-leather high heels.

I reached behind her and undid the necklace.

As soon as I did, her appearance began to melt and bubble and curdle like boiling milk. Until the thing before us was a skinny, frail woman with mean little eyes. I didn’t recognize her, but she looked… human. Not like one of the not-people that frequented my store.

“You’re not my aunt.”

“I’m not your aunt.” She looked horrified at what she’d just said. “What—what did you do to me?!” she shrieked.

“Entity 987. Truth-telling shoes.”

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Maude.”

“How do you know Giselle?”

“I worked for her for three years. Before the bitch fired me.”

“Why did she fire you?”

“I was stealing some of the wares. And some of her food.”

My heart dropped. The food-stealing employee… *she* was the one who’d orchestrated all this? Stolen the necklace, worn it to look like her? Not even one of the more supernatural not-people? Just this random woman?

“… Why?” I asked.

“I don’t report all the items to the Board. I sell the lethal ones on the black market for a ton of money.”

Money. That was always it, wasn’t it?

I sucked in a deep breath, dreading the next question. “Where’s Giselle?”

She grinned crookedly. “In the fridge.”

My heart plummeted to the floor.

“I hit her over the head with a hammer. Never saw it coming. Then I dismembered her, piece-by-piece, and locked her in her beloved fridge with all her beloved food.”

My mouth hung open. My heart pounded. Tears stung my eyes. I glanced at Kira and Elias—they, too, were staring wide-eyed down at Maude.

“How… how could you?” I whispered.

“It was easy. I just—”

“Why hire Nadia?” Kira cut in.

“Well, I thought she might be useful. Selling on the black market takes a lot of time, and I was falling behind on sales enough for the Board to notice. I knew Giselle hadn’t seen her in a few years, and wouldn’t pick up on the difference. So I figured…”

*It can’t be true.*

I ran through the store. Down the hall. Into the office.

I yanked the fridge door open a crack, as far as it would go with the lock still attached.

The truth shoes did their job. There was a lock of hair—a bit of purpled flesh—everything portioned neatly in Ziploc bags, laid on top of each other like she was meal prepping, not disposing of a body.

I collapsed onto the ground and began to sob, my tears stinging the wounds Maude had sliced into my cheeks.

\*\*\*

The police requestioned Maude while she was still in the chair, and she told them everything. She was arrested and taken away, after the rocking chair released her. (The officers were quite confused when they tried to stand her up, but the chair remained fused to her butt.)

I glared at her mean little eyes through the shop window, hoping that she would be served justice.

Kira and I run the shop now. Apparently Aunt Gigi’s will stated that, in the event of her death, the shop would be left to the current employees; which was Kira and me. So I guess this is our job now. Dealing with artifacts that may, or may not, kill us.

It’s definitely not how I imagined my life to go.

But life never turns out the way we expect, does it?
