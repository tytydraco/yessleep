I’ve been left with no other option but this. I need an answer. My escape from that house has done me no good at all, and I need to find something that’ll give me some sort of hint, clue, revelation, or whatever; anything that can make things better. I’ve decided my best choice would be to detail the last month as best as I can in order to figure everything out and maybe have you guys give me suggestions if you’ve encountered the problem as well. At this point in time, I’m still in the dark when processing what happened and why it happened. 


The first time I had noticed anything was when my girlfriend, Eileen, had come over at the beginning of the month. I hadn’t seen her for about a month and a half at that point since she was out visiting her family across the country. 


Eileen let herself in and met me in the foyer. “Man, I never get over this house. Seriously Bruce, how’d a guy like you get it again?” I returned her jab with a smile, bringing her in for a hug and getting the chance to smell her curly brown hair, hoping to find some peace. Once we released, I also took a look around the room, and to be perfectly honest, I had no idea what she saw in the place. There was very little overhead lighting, and the overhead lighting there was, like the glass chandelier in the foyer, was so dim it might as well have not even been there. There were also way too many little crevices within the ancient furniture and cabinets my parents had given me for dust to be stuck in, and I’m not the best cleaner. At least there was hardwood floors, I always used to love those. 


We walked through the foyer and entered my equally dim living room. The two of us sat down on my squishy velvet couch, excited to talk more. “So, how was the family?” I asked. 

“Ugh, I’ve been waiting to tell you this in person because I just can’t do it with my Mom anymore. She’s always like ‘Why do you live so far away? Do you not like being around us?’ and in my head I’m like ‘Yeah, when you act like this I don’t.’ Seriously, I remind her every time she calls me and every time I visit her that I’m here for work, but she just straight up does not listen to a word I say. My dad might be worse because he never backs me up, he just sits there while my mom complains about me directly to my face; what the hell is wrong with him? He knows how much I love my job here. Oh, I just remembered this thing; every night my brother would just get in his car and drive somewhere. That’s weird right? He wouldn’t tell mom or dad where he was going, and my mom tried to talk to him about it a few times, but he would just say he's ‘going to drive around’ whatever that means.” In conclusion of her speech, she let out a large sigh, raised her head and her annoyed expression turned to a bright smile. “How was your month?”


“Pretty good.” The annoyed expression returned to her face. 


“That’s all I get? Come on, I wanna hear what you’ve been up to.” I explained to her that While she was gone, I didn’t really do much, just sat around the house playing video games, watching TV, working on my birdhouse; boring stuff like that. I thought about telling her about the trip I had gone on two weeks before she arrived. I went and saw an old friend in our hometown not far from here, but I wouldn’t tell her about that trip; she didn’t need to hear about it. “Boooooringgggg.” She responded. “Alright, enough catch up, my brother was telling me about this old movie that we should definitely watch. It’s called Taxi Driver it sounded pretty interesting.”


I’d already seen the movie about a dozen times, but I wasn’t that upset about watching it again. We looked through all 9 streaming services I paid for, but it wasn’t on any of them. That’s when I remembered that I had the DVD in my storage space upstairs. I told Eileen I’d be right back and headed to the foyer to climb the stairs that wrapped around the curved wall. I walked down the long hallway, and at the end laid my tiny little storage unit.


Upon entering, I pulled the cord which turned on the single lightbulb dangling from a string. This light revealed the dozens of cardboard boxes filled with junk that I had nowhere else to put. I looked through the boxes labeled “DVD’s” in permanent marker. 


I easily found Taxi Driver and prepared to leave, but my eye was caught by something in the corner of the room. It’s something that shouldn’t have been there. It seemed as if there was dust perpetually floating in the air, but as I put my hand through it, nothing happened, it’s form never changed, and if anything, it spread out even farther from the corner. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but it looked like fog had entered my house somehow, and never left. How this could have happened was unknown to me because for one thing, my storage space had zero windows, and second, there hadn’t been a foggy day in my town for the past few months.  “Bruce, come on, I’m bored down here!” I looked to the door and back at the fog. It would have to be a tomorrow problem. 


The rest of the night was fairly uneventful, we watched the movie, and I didn’t even get upset when she talked over my favorite parts; the more distractions the better. Once the movie was finished we went to bed, and her tight embraced numbed my brain of any problem it could have thought up. However, once we had finished breakfast the next morning, and she kissed me goodbye, I had no choice to return my thoughts to what lied upstairs. 
I looked down at my watch, 8:12 AM, I had about 50 minutes before I had to get to work. I went to my white-tiled laundry room, grabbed a handheld vacuum cleaner and marched upstairs. When I opened the door to the storage space, I found the fog to have spread even further to the point where it was leaning up against the door. I could hardly see the labels of my boxes it had grown so dense. Irritation ran through me, leading me to start up the vacuum, clearing the tiny space of this mystery substance, and once the job was done, I slammed the door and began getting ready for work. 
After getting out of the shower, I looked in the mirror and observed how my facial hair had evolved from simple stubble to a full-on beard in the past few months. I thought about shaving, but remembered how much I despised my face when naked and exposed to the world. In my closest I put on my favorite plaid shirt, as well as my khakis and boots. I exited my bedroom, and turned to go down the stairs, but a troubling feeling crept up inside me. 


My eyes looked down the deep, dark hallway, and soon my legs followed. I arrived at the door and looked to the crack at its bottom to find fog slowly spilling out. I took a step back and saw that the entire outline of the door had also begun spewing out a dense fog at a torturously slow pace. A loud bang from the door came soon afterwards.  My feet led me all the way down the hallway and stairs before my brain even had time to process my movements. I fast-walked through the kitchen, past the laundry room, and into my garage, hopping into my blue pick-up truck, and pulling out into the driveway. 


As I was backing out onto the street, I heard a voice I really didn’t want to, “Yo, buddy! How’s it hangin’ man? Haven’t seen you in a little while.” I stopped my truck and found my neighbor, Joey, crossing his lawn to come talk to me. In the fall weather, his spray on tan looked more ridiculous than ever, and his athletic shorts and t-shirt seemingly had grown tighter than ever as well. The sandy blonde hair attached to his skull bounced as he walked, making me think it would fly off at any moment. He arrived at my window and leaned his bulging bicep on my truck. “Everything alright pal? You look a bit spooked.” I hadn’t realized that my expression hadn’t changed since I left my house. 


“Uh, yeah, everything’s alright. I think I’ve got some mouse infestation or something. Been finding some droppings and stuff.” A smirk spread across Joey’s face.


“Mice? Really dude? That’s what’s got you freaked?”


“Well, I’m not sure it’s mice exactly, it’s possible there’s opossums… or something much bigger.” 

Joey put his vein-ridden hand on my shoulder.
“Well, I could definitely help; show you how a guy like me gets it done.” 


“No, I think I can handle it.” I said. He eyed me up and down,


“You sure about that bud?” Joey took a step back and began stretching his arms. “Listen, I’m good with this stuff. Just a few weeks ago, I found a whole family of raccoons in my garage, and I choked ‘em all out in under a minute.” He leaned in closer to me. “Let’s just say my woman was very pleased about it.” 

Not being able to stand this conversation for one more second, I told him I had to get to work. “Yeah me too, lots of new clients at the gym came in recently; someone’s gotta show ‘em how it’s done.” Joey replied. He jogged over to his car and freed me of his presence. 


I arrived at my woodshop and opened up at around 9:07AM, hoping my work would distract me from home. My shop was located on the main street of the small town I’d moved to about a year ago when I bought the house. The old street was filled with little shops of similar size to mine, just a room with enough space for some shelves and a check-out desk. I always loved wood working ever since I was a kid, but the much larger projects I was interested in, such as my two-story birdhouse, doesn’t sell as well as stupid little knick-knacks with “Live, Laugh, Love” plastered onto them. Making and selling these little things were a good enough diversion for me until the workday had concluded. 


I locked up shop and spotted the brick building across the street. Russell’s Everything Fix was what the sign said. It was a store own by one of my Dad’s old friends and he helped me get a claim on a room for my shop. Besides that one nice thing, I don’t think Russell really liked me all that much. Ever since I was a kid I would always hear him talking to my dad how I wasn’t being raised hard enough or something and he always looked at me with this annoying face of disapproval.


I wanted to walk over to his shop and ask him to take a look around my house for me, but I wasn’t sure. What if he found nothing, or what if he found it was just a simple problem that could be solved with the twist of a wrench? I couldn’t like such an idiot in front of him, and besides, nothing all that bad had happened. That bang didn’t necessarily come from behind the door, maybe it was just a pipe bursting. That fog could have also just been a bad filtration problem, but what if it wasn’t? I can’t call over Russell or anyone else until I’m sure something is actually wrong.


I arrived home, and before entering my house, I stopped to look at my two-story birdhouse. It was an exact replica of my own house, and its creation was almost complete. The green roof stood out from the cream-colored walls which held the deep windows that led to the spots where birds could look out of. I was still unsure if I should sell it when I finish adding all the paint, or if I should keep it outside my own house. Eventually, I stopped stalling and headed inside. 


I crept through the rooms of the bottom floor and didn’t see any fog crawling on the ancient furniture. I didn’t hear anything either; maybe that bang was just my brain trying to spook me? My courage shrank as I entered the foyer and followed the stairs with my eyes to the dark hallway above. I finally arrived at the top after much thought put into every step. The hallway was now even further filled with fog and had now stretched so far it reached the door of the guest bedroom. I looked towards the door of the storage space; it was wide open. If anything was in there, it had gotten out. 


The next week was much of the same: wake up, look at the newly expanded fog, get ready for work, go to work, come back, see that the fog had gotten farther, and try my best to go to sleep at night. I used rolled up towels and rugs and stuffed them in the cracks at the bottom of the doors where most of the fog was moving through, but it didn’t work; they’d be moved out of the way the second I looked the other direction. Every passing day filled me with more anxiety and fear, wondering what in the hell was happening and why it was happening to me. 
The only semblance of peace I got within the week were the three nights Eileen had come over. 

Every time she would see the exhaustion in my eyes and ask me if everything was ok, and I would tell her she has nothing to worry about. “I’ve just been working really hard on this new woodworking project lately.” I said. 


“Oh… can I see it?” She asked enthusiastically. I looked from her face towards the TV.


“No, sorry. I don’t think I’m ready to let you see it yet, still a work in progress, you know?”


“Ok.” She responded, giving me a look that suggested she somehow knew everything. I also “accidently” had us fall asleep on the couch every night because she really did not need to see what was happening upstairs. 


The morning after, we made breakfast together as we always did. Well, she would cook, and I would do the dishes afterwards at least; she didn’t trust me much with the food after I made some scrambled eggs that tasted like a sewage drain. I walked her to the front door, and before heading out, she turned to me with that look again. “Are you sure you don’t need anything? I’m always here if you want to get anything off your chest.” Her statement annoyed me, as if she thinks I can’t deal with my problems on my own, especially after me telling her so many times that I can.  She wouldn’t know anything about how to deal with a foggy upstairs hallway, but then again no one else would either. 

My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of something being knocked over upstairs. Fear shot through my body as Eileen took a step forward, asking “What the hell was that?” I lightly pushed her back to where she was before, 


“Oh, that’s my neighbor Joey’s cat, he said his sitter quit on him last night, so he asked me to step up.” 
“Joey has a cat sitter. Really? Didn’t think a guy like him would care that much for his pets. I didn’t even know he had a cat.” 


“Yeah she’s sick right now, so I should probably go check on her.” I said, trying to end her visit. I nudged her outside and called out with a “Love you, bye!” I made sure to watch as she pulled out of the driveway before walking upstairs and stepping into the fog which had reached the bathroom door at this point. 


Oddly enough though, the fog hadn’t creeped into bathroom as it had done with the guest bedroom, only standing the height of the doorway, pressed up against it as if there was some force field.  I looked through the bathroom and found nothing that looked as if it had been knocked over, which forced me to venture deeper into the fog. 

Every step I took towards the storage space led me to a place where might sight was less and less visible, yet I was still able to make out rough shapes of objects, and only when I got close enough could I see the faces of my family on the photographs I had framed. I finally arrived at the guest bedroom, saw the cleared away towel at the foot of the door and peered inside to see a fog even denser than in the hallway. I slowly waded through, making my way to the other side of the bed, and found the bedside table to have been flung over on its front. Nothing else in the room hinted at the reason for its falling, until I got a closer look at the back of the bedside table to find little scratches in the wood placed at it’s center. I instantly rose to my feet and walked out of the fog to the comfort of my living room.


My mind was racing, trying to think of any animal that could have gotten into my house, that also happened to coincide with an influx of fog, but the rationalities I was producing became too far-fetched even for my fearful mind to accept. I needed to take my attention off of it; I’d become too stressed as of late, that had to be the answer. I cautiously sat on my couch, took out my phone, and opened Instagram. 


After a few minutes of scrolling through finance guys trying to get me to join their program, body builder vlogs, and engagement photos of an old friend, I found a post I never wanted to see. It was my hometown police station’s account, giving notice to the public of a tragic situation that had transpired three weeks prior. They said they had someone in custody. Even though I was the one who called the police, I hoped I would never have to hear of this again. 


“HELP!” The sound came from upstairs; it shook through my body so forcefully I dropped my phone on the floor. The part of the scream that disturbed me the most was the voice that carried it; it was my voice. It wasn’t just one voice either, it was as if a choir composed of my clones screamed to the heavens this cry for help. 


I rose from my seat, grabbed the fire poker from the nearby fireplace, and edged myself up the stairs. It had to be all in my head, how could it not have been? No one else had my voice but me. When I reached the top of the stairs, the belief that this was anything but reality was shot and killed. On the floor, there was a scratch in the wood, but not like the scratch I saw on the bedside table. This one was thick, deep, and gnarled. It’s length stretched the entirety of the long hallway and concluded at the point where the fog stopped as well:  about a foot from my bedroom. Where the scratch ended, an arrow had been etched into the wood. It was pointed in the direction of my front door. 


I retreated downstairs again and wanted to call the police, but what would they do? They would act like the person responsible for this was human, but I had grown more and more certain that that wasn’t the case. This situation was beyond reasoning, and the cops would know that which would lead them to believe that I was crazy person who did this himself. I couldn’t have that happen. Another thought in my mind was just getting in my truck and leaving, letting whatever the hell lives up there haunt the next person who moved in. My excitement over this idea began to grow, but my mind then thought of the disappointed faces of all the townsfolk I had grown so accustomed to over the past year. 

I thought of how they would all chuckle and smirk when the man who runs the wood shop ran away from his home and store because a fog had entered his house. What would Eileen have thought if I had run away right then? She couldn’t come along with me; she couldn’t know about this. I had to be strong for her. I was entirely alone in this struggle. I had to fight this thing myself, and in order to do that, I needed to find out more about it. 


The next five days didn’t lead to much excitement. My plan at the time was to see what the thing would do now that it didn’t have much room to expand its territory with the entirety of the hallway being filled with the continuously thickening fog. I threw a few things up the stairs like a sandwich, a bottle of water, and even a little fidget cube in order to see what it’d do with it. Nothing happened. No matter how long I let them sit on top of that scarred wood, they wouldn’t move an inch. 

Even though the towels I put up were still being thrown away in an instant. 
Eileen had called three times in those five days and would ask if it was ok if she’d spend the night. I always managed to come up with some excuse, like how I was working late, or I was feeling tired. These excuses managed to work somehow but I always felt that with each passing objection, she grew more and more suspicious about what was happening in my house. Realistically, she could have come over and been safe downstairs, but the wall of fog was at a point where one could instantly see it at the top of the stairs as soon as they entered my front door, and I can’t risk letting her get harmed by whatever’s up there. 


It soon dawned on me that people might be able to see the fog through the windows, so I grabbed my fall jacket and headed outside. The fog had entered my bedroom at this point, and I could see through the window into the room on the side of my house an odd, misty substance floating around. I started to head inside to close all of my upstairs curtains, but I was once again stopped by the grating voice of my neighbor.  


“Hey bud, where ya’ going? You just got out here.” I turned around, finding Joey standing with sunglasses on his head and his push lawnmower ready to be started. 


“I just wanted a bit of fresh air.” I responded, slowly inching backwards towards my front door. 


“Me too, some great weather for a Saturday, right?”


“Yup.” Joey strutted over to me and put his meaty arm around my shoulder before I could object.


“Hey, you still got that mouse problem?”


“I think it’s an opossum.”


“Ok, yeah sure.” Joey scoffed. “I mean, pal, this isn’t that hard, but I guess you wouldn’t understand. A bit of elbow grease is needed in these jobs, ya’ know?” I responded with the blankest face I could muster; it was the only face that could cover my anger. Joey put his sunglasses over his eyes, “Look, there’s nothing wrong with getting a man to get shit done. There’s no shame in it. No one’s gonna look at ya’ differently. Well, except probably that girl of yours. What’s her name? Kelly? Ellie?”


“Eileen.”


“That’s the one, thanks pal.” He took his hand off my shoulder and began stretching his legs, “By the way, you should tell her to come over to my gym and get a membership. Make sure to tell her to find Joey. I’ll be good to her bud, don’t you worry.”


It took everything in my body not to beat Joey to the ground, punching him in the face until it turned to a dust. I started to step towards him to begin a fight I would definitely lose, but where my neighbor’s attention was directed in made me stop; it was at my bedroom window. 


“What’s all that misty shit in your house about?” My heart raced as he stopped his stretching and began walking closer to the window to get a better look.


“It’s my dry ice machine.” Joey looked at me with confusion.


“You got one of those?”


“Yeah, I got it a few weeks ago. I tried it this morning, but I didn’t know how to work it, so it got a bit out of hand.” I said, trying to keep my composure. 


“Figures.” Joey scoffed again. I began walking backwards towards my door again,


“I should go clear out that fog, see you around.” 


“Wait a minute, pal.” I stopped. “I’ll give ya’ one week to figure out this little mouse problem of yours. If ya’ can’t do it, I’m gonna go in there and I’ll show you what you need to do for further references and all that.” He finished with a smirk.


“I really don’t think you should do that.” I said.


“You don’t need to thank me, bud.” He pointed at me with his veiny finger. “Ya’ got one week.” Joey strutted back over to his lawnmower and cranked the pull start harder than I’d ever seen one pulled. 


As soon as I got inside, I climbed the stairs two at a time, sprinted through the fog, into my bedroom and closed the curtains. Upon one of the wooden windowsills, I found more little scratch marks; it was a good thing I always locked my windows. The thought of the thing breaking the windows crept into my mind, but I remembered that for whatever reason this house came with poly carbonate windows, that were installed by the last guy who lived here. All the windows were extremely strong besides the one embedded onto the front door. The guy said he had some big dog he didn’t want to get out, but it still seemed a tad extreme. 


When I entered the guest bedroom to close the curtains, my theory about the breaking the windows was proven right as I observed large scars upon the glass. It seems whatever was trying to get out through the glass gave up after a few attempts. 
Finishing with the windows, I made my way back downstairs to make myself a late breakfast. As I ate my cold turkey sandwich, alone at my table, I noticed my leg shaking. This is something it’d done for my entire life, but never at this speed, and I didn’t know why I was so nervous. Sure, there was a fog covering my upstairs with something living in it, but it didn’t seem like it was going anywhere. I was convinced that if the thing really wanted to kill me, it already would have with my many expeditions into the fog. 


I could deal with the situation, I had too, no one else was going to help me and their involvement would only get in my way. My fingers promptly began rapidly tapping upon the wooden table as well, and I wasn’t sure why; I was going to kill it soon enough. 
I finished my meal, washed my plate, and as I turned from the sink, my eyes fixed upon the door across from the laundry room. It was the door to a small supplies closet as well as the trap door to my crawl space, but something I saw nearly made me fall to knees; fog spilling out of its frame and onto my kitchen floor. It traveled so far it nearly reached my feet at the sink. 


“Shit. Shit. Shit.” I whispered as I crept my way to the door. I opened it, which prompted the fog filling the tiny supply closet to coming pouring out into the rest of my house. The fog was coming from where I expected it would, beneath the trap door. It’s frame was spitting the putrid, fog out into the air at a rate faster than the storage space upstairs. With shaky breath, I grabbed the metal handle on the floor, and pulled, revealing the dirt floor beneath my house. The fog was dense, and as I slowly hung my head into the opened whole to get a better look, I saw that the ever-thickening fog had been building underneath the entirety of my house for days, possibly weeks at that point. 


That was the day I first saw it. There were no corners, closets, or crevices to hide within in this space, only the fog, but I still saw it. I didn’t get a good look, but I spotted something speedily crawling like an insect the size of a black lab at the far corner from the trap door. The fog made it so I could only see it’s outline, and as it realized my attention was on it, it scurried out of eyesight; the legs attached to it moving at an unfathomable pace. 


As soon as it was out of sight, I heard the scratching and pattering of his legs quickening behind my dangling head. I turned and saw it getting closer and closer, the pattering turned to stamping as I saw the form lunge towards the light emanating from the supply closet. My head quickly reared back out of the crawl space, leaving my arms to slam the trap door shut. Scratching and banging was quickly heard soon after. With every bang of the door, fog poured in faster and faster, prompting me to shut and lock the door to the supplies closet. 


As soon as I turned the lock, the sounds stopped, and for a brief moment, felt as if I had escaped the danger, until I heard more banging upstairs. As I raced over to my foyer, I could hear multiples of my voice crying out in an ununified manner, “PLEASE! PLEASE! OUT! STOP! PLEASE!” The overpowering onslaught of my own voice multiplied stopped me at the foot of the stairs. I couldn’t move and before I could even try to, I heard the same voices yelling of the same words from the direction of the trap door. “DON’T! WAIT! HELP! BACK! OUT! OUT! OUT!”  The desperate cries of my horrified voice crashing over one another put me into a petrified state. I couldn’t do anything. I simply sat on the carpet in my foyer and waited for the screams and the banging to stop. It took an hour for silence to grace me once again. 


I couldn’t take it anymore. I rose from the carpet, grabbed my keys, passed through the substantially fog-filled kitchen and laundry room, entered the garage, got in my truck, and drove to my shop. I wouldn’t be spending any more time at my house than I had to, but I would return; I’ll deal with this thing, and no one else needs to know about it.
