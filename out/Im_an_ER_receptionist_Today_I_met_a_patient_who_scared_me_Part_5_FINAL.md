Hi. This is Travis. I’m sorry to tell everyone this  but Melissa is in a coma. I’m going to tell you what happened. As best I can.

Melissa, and that male nurse, spoke of a squidge. I don’t know what it is but it seems the doctor sold it as an IV. Apparently it was from the dark web? And it supposed to summons an evil demon inside you if you consume it. The more you consume of it, the more evil it will make you.

Peter, my fucking asshole of a kidnapper, has been consuming that stuff for 5 years. Or God knows how long. Last time I had a normal life was 2018. I called Melissa. She asked how I was doing. I said the meds were giving me a headache and I felt strange. She told me to go home from work. suddenly I had this urge to jump out of the window, holler "wee hee yay HO!!" Like a cowboy on crack and run to the beach not far from my work.

I had an appointment about Peter's dad. His dad died in the hospital. He kept coming into my office, claiming triple the amount of life insurance he was entitled to.

He stressed me about it. He said "I’ll show you real hell if you don’t give me my money you dick".

Next thing I know a cloth covers my mouth and I woke ip in that cellar.Have you ever spent five fucking years alone in a fucking cellar? It was utter hell. I don’t remember. I never knew what day it was. What time. I never knew my own name anymore. It felt like a fucking eternity. My only orientation was the sun going up and down. Each day felt like it was never ending. It was one. Single. Fucking. Hell. For 5 years, I had my food given to me through a fucking doorcrack. I am still a wreck.I don’t recognize myself & I still don't understand what happened to me. I aged 40 years. I don’t even know how old I am. Nor WHO I am. All I know is, I’m in Melissa‘s apartment now. I don’t know if she’ll ever wake up. I don't know if she'll ever come back here alive again.The male nurse has moved in with me. I don’t know why. But I couldn’t argue having a nurse near me is helping. He suggested to put me in a ward.

I’m telling you what he wrote down on his notepad.

\- *Melissa will likely never wake up again.*

*She had too much of the squidge.*

*- Sam and I made sure to take all her money if she doesn’t wake up.*

*- Peter needs to die.*

*- Appointment with Sam and Peter at 10am- Plan: I give Peter his "IV", but really we kill him with colchicine"- Then Peter will forever be free of the demons and all the demons die.*

*- every person that took the squidge needs to die. Unless, their dose is small enough to get it out of their system. Then, a proper beating and a nice bloodfest will suffice to get it out.*

The fuck is this. I can't make a rhyme on that. My head is still way too fucked to process things. I can't handle this. I'm done.

Hey. Jason here. Travis is out. I quieted him down if you know what I mean. Geesh being a caretaker of a grown ass man baby is exhausting. Bruh. So, I have Melissa's phone now. I took it away from Travis.I gotta quickly finish the story if you want to know the rest.

Alright?

Good.

We ran from the chapel toilet into Melissa's place.

Melissa had travis take a bath and then put him to bed. She couldn’t bear leaving him alone after his major trauma.

Melissa and I tried to plan out the rest. We had to take Peter out but didn’t know how.

Among us: Melissa has kind of been feening for me lately. Hehe. I don’t blame her. But anyways.

We wrote down the notes which the nosey fucker has already told you. (That’ll teach him to stay away from other people’s stuff in the future).

So I will now tell the story.

We made an appointment to kill Peter with colchicine.To clarify: colchicine is used as an antirheumatic. But if you dose too high, it is lethal. We planned on injecting Peter the triple deadly dose.How it went? We (Melissa and I) started our shift as usual. Before, Melissa had to punch me a couple more times to get all the leftover black squidge out of my system.So now, the demon is gone.

Peter returned to the reception and did his usual provocative routine. Melissa played along to distract him, while I convinced Sam to prepare the lethal injection.But Peter was very mad at her for "stealing his precious hotage" - Hence he grabbed the computer keyboard and broke it on her head, instantly knocking her out. Then he vomited the black squidge into Melissa's open mouth. Peter went totally berzerk. He kneeled next to Melissa, made gargling noises, and kept throwing up black shit and his mouth was foaming. His eyes glowed red. I pressed the emergency button for Sam. Sam came. He tried to save Melissa by injecting her with an IV, but realized too late that it was the squidge. So now Melissa's body is overloaded with evil.We don’t know how to get it out of her yet.

Peter kept screaming, gargling and shouting "Dad! Daaaaaaaaad! I want my fucking daaaaaad back!! And I want my doughhhhhh" then Sam gave him a kick in the head, which made Peter even more aggressive. he teared Sam down to the floor with him and tried to strangle him.Sam struggled. His lips were getting blue. I had to do something.Peter yelled so loud that it could bring back the dead. "YOU… YOU… YOU JERK!!!!! KILLED MY FATHER!! YOU TOOK EVERYTHING I HAAAAAD!!!" He strangled and shook Sam around. "HOW DO YOU LIKE THAAAAT? MMMMM-"Sam's eyes were red and watery and he tried to look at me with a pleading face, but I froze. I couldn’t do anything. I just stood and watched. Sam used his legs to kick Peter, then managed to aim for his crotch. Peter flinched, let go of Sam and leg him collapse to the ground. Sam held his throat and squeaked "let me go! Take HER!" , pointing at Melissa. Peter (who seemed to have forgotten about her, pointed at Melissa and continued yelling: "MELISSA!!! YOU BITCH!!! YOU ARE THE CULPRIT!!! YOU - MUST - DIEEEE!!! Aaaaahghggggghhhh…"

It was so loud that security came. They apprehended Peter and took him to the shock room. I was assigned to be his carer. I took the colchicine and injected him with it. Three days later, he was dead.

Travis? I don’t know. He said he had a headache and took a bottle of acetaminophen with him to his room. I haven’t heard from him in like a day. Might check on him later.

Sam doesn’t like Melissa. For whatever reason.Also, I saw him send a message to Melissa the other day. It said "next time, you won’t wake up".

He wanted Peter to take Melissa instead of him to pull himself out of the trouble.But I am fucking done. Alright? This is it. I’m going to quit my job next week. I don’t want to work with an EVIL doctor like Sam anymore. Plenty of hospitals are looking for Staff especially nurses. I am a good nurse. I’m never touching dark web shit again. And I don’t ever want to see Sam again.

I miiiiight just go back to my next shift and use some leftover colchicine on Sam. I’m going to make it look like a suicide. Idgaf. Ok? Yeah. That’ll do. But I’m out.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I guess what they say is true. Evil people love being in healthcare. But I am not evil. I am a good nurse.

&#x200B;

PS: I sure hope Melissa does wake up one day. If she doesn’t, then neither do I want to. But… someone else will NOT wake up. I will make sure. This will end the story.

&#x200B;

Love.
