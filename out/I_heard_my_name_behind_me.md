I heard my name behind me.

So, I have been hunting my entire life. I am a young adult so its been most of my life. Anyway, I have been hunting in this area forever, and I pretty much know what walks and lives in the woods.

Me and my papa have 2 stands where we go hunt at. To get back to the first stand where he hunts, we walk down a dirt road for a half mile and this road is surrounded by trees and a cutdown. He gets into that stand and I turn left to go around the field he watches and go into a swampy, cutdown area where my stand is farther back. I have been in and out of this stand and walked it so many times with and without my papa at night, but this was different. Its been about 2 years, but I was freaked out from it. 

I remember walking out from my stand near dark and past his field and my papa usually gets out as he sees me and walks the road. Well, usually I see him, but I didn't this time so I walked about 100 yards down the the road to see if I could catch up... then I heard my name near the stand in his voice. I stopped and waited to see if he was going to catch up but I couldnt see him and never did. I looked through my rifle scope and never saw anything, so I started walking back to the stand but stopped.

 I didn't see him or anything and he should've caught up to me by then. I felt something strange, like I shouldn't walk there. And I heard it so clear in my papas voice. I heard my name and this has never happened before. I am scared of the dark... but this was new and I was calm and everything up to when I heard it. So, I sprinted down the road back to the truck, always looking behind me, and when I got to the truck, my papa was there and been there for a bit, waiting for me. I told him and he said he never said my name, cause he got down earlier then he usually did.

I really don't know what could have done it. I know what all the birds, animals, and trees sound like and none could ever say my name like that in my papas voice. I know that land like the back of my hand... and it felt so wrong when I started heading back. I ain't saying it was a skinwalker or something like that but it just scared me really badly. I don't know.

I am still freaked out about it. I never heard it again nor has anyone else heard it. It just freaked me out because I genuinely thought it was my papa calling my name. I still remember clearly, looking back in the darkness, in the road, almost going back to the stand. I still hunt there, though I haven't gone without someone nearby.
