Sorry that I haven’t been able to update you all. There was an issue with the station’s power generator, and we had no electricity for the past 48 hours.

This last day has been pretty fucking wild. I thought I was already living my worst nightmare, but everything is amplified when it’s pitch-black and you can’t see your hand right in front of your face. It all started at around midnight two nights ago, when the gentle whir of the station’s gasoline-powered generator suddenly stopped with a loud clunk.

I awoke with a start, and called out quietly to Emily, “Did the generator stop?” “Yeah, I think so,” came Emily’s hushed reply. I carefully climbed down the ladder and felt around under Emily’s bunk for the emergency pack that is kept in every room of the research station. After I found the pack, I pulled it out and grabbed the flashlight and turned it on. The cheap plastic flashlight cast a pale yellow glow across the room. Emily and I would have to ration how much we used the flashlight, since we didn’t know how much the batteries would last.

“O-okay, Emily, wh-what do we do now? We have no power, no light, and a very li-limited amount of time that we can use our f-flashlight. What do we do?” I stammered. Emily suggested that we could raid other rooms for other emergency packs, since those would contain flashlights as well. “That would at least buy us some time to try to fix the generator, and at least we would have some light,” Emily said.

So Emily and I set off in search of the 9 other bedroom’s emergency packs. We confidently strode into the neighboring room, and pointed the flashlight under the bottom bunk. “Well, fuck me senseless,” I cursed under my breath. The emergency pack was gone.

“There has to be a pack in here somewhere!” exclaimed Emily. We frantically search the whole room: in the closet, underneath the mattresses, behind the door: nothing. No emergency pack. “No big deal,” I said. “Maybe there never was a pack in here. Let’s just search the other rooms.”

My plan should have worked, but it didn’t. One by one, each of the rooms showed no emergency packs. Not a single one. Depressed and disheartened, Emily and I returned to our room and replaced the furniture that blocked the door. We would turn out the flashlight, and agreed to work on the issue when we woke up in the morning. But it was clear: something, or someone, had taken all of our emergency supplies.

A few hours later, the dim light of dawn crept through the tiny window of our room. I looked down and saw Emily quietly pacing, muttering to herself. She looked up and saw me, and smiled.

“I think I know how to get the power back on!” She exclaimed. “Shhh! Not so loud,” I whispered. “Okay. So remember how the fuel tank is outside, and when we set it up we dropped it?” Emily asked. I replied, “Yeah, why?”

Emily then proceeded to explain, in great detail, how dropping the generator fuel tank may have damaged the insulation, and the ferocious Arctic winds may have ripped some of it off. She wanted to check it out to confirm her theory, and I agreed. We were going outside.

After suiting up in our excursion suits, we went outside to assess the issue. Just as Emily had hypothesized, a large chunk of the insulating foam of the fuel tank had been blown off by the wind. We patched up the tank with spray foam, and attached some small chemical heaters to the tank to melt the frozen gasoline.

Back inside the station, after waiting a few excruciatingly stressful hours, the power finally came back on. Relieved, Emily and I went to bed, having completed an exhausting day.

The next morning, I woke again to the tapping sound, unnatural and disturbing. We still don’t know what the hell is causing that sound. It’s not mechanical, it sounds more like an organic sound. Something is deliberately making it. I looked down at Emily, who was awake and staring up into nothing. She saw me and snapped out of her trancelike state. We carefully moved our blockade out of the way, and ventured out of our room to get food.

Yesterday was pretty uneventful, no more issues other than the creepy tapping. But when I woke up this morning, I noticed something: the chef’s knife I kept under my pillow was gone.
