I’m a first officer for a commercial airline.

  


Been flying professionally for six years now. I’ve seen my share of unsettling things at 35,000 feet. Once, we had to divert mid-flight when an elderly woman started vomiting blood. Her grandson sat silently beside her while we coordinated with medics on the ground. We never did find out what happened to her.

  


But nothing prepared me for what happened on Flight 237.

  


It’s why I’ll never set foot on a plane again.

  


That morning started normal. Clear skies over Seattle. We had a routine route to Denver. Passengers were boarding, and among them was a business-class regular who was about to hit his two-million-mile milestone. Flight attendants said the airline had even planned a small celebration on arrival.

  


But before we could take off, there was a pounding on the cockpit door.

  


The interphone buzzed. One of the flight attendants called in, her voice tight.

  


“Passenger mid-cabin is freaking out—says he *needs* to get off the plane. Now.”

  


We taxied back.

  


Turns out, it was the two-million-miler. The guy who’d flown more than some pilots I know.

  


The lead attendant said he was pale, sweating through his shirt. Told her, *“If I don’t get off this flight right now, I’ll never see my family again.”*

  


That kind of thing sits in your gut, even if you laugh it off.

  


Captain Philip and I exchanged glances. “Guy probably watched too many crash documentaries,” I said, trying to shake it. The captain nodded, ran through a few quick checks.

  


No faults. No warnings. No weather. All systems normal.

  


So we departed.

  


That was the worst decision we ever made.

  


Our plane was climbing out of Seattle, chasing dusk. The horizon shimmered like heat over asphalt. I’ve flown this route dozens of times. Routine. Familiar.

  


But somewhere over the Rockies, something changed.

  


Captain Philip started… twitching. Subtle at first. A hand that wouldn’t sit still. A whisper under his breath.

  


I assumed fatigue. Long week. Maybe some stuff at home.

  


But something was off. Even in turbulence or emergencies, captains don’t unravel. 

  


All pilots wear masks, fake assurance stitched together by routine and caffeine.

  


Then Captain Philip started muttering.

  


At first I thought he was rehearsing callouts.

  


But they weren’t words I knew.

  


His hands trembled. His breathing changed. I asked if he was okay. He didn’t respond.

  


His composure was slipping.

  


Then the clouds changed.

  


Not the color. The *texture*.

  


They churned like boiling water, like something alive beneath the surface. Instruments flickered. Radios dropped out.

  


Static.

  


Then… voices.

  


Faint at first. Not interference but *voices.* One of them said my mother’s name.

  


Another spoke in *my own voice.*

  


I stared at the comm panel, paralyzed. Captain Philip turned toward me, slow.

  


His face wasn’t wrong in any obvious way… Just *off.* Like someone wearing a humans face, but not quite knowing how to use its own muscles to smile.

  


“We’re almost there,” he said.

  


“Where’s *there*?” I asked.

  


He grinned again. Cracked. Empty. “Where all judgment goes, my friend.”

  


Outside the windshield, the sky had gone black. Not a void…. No. Stars still burned, but they were… wrong. Twisted, like they were melting in slow motion.

  


The plane wasn’t flying anymore. We were *sinking.* Like being pulled downward through quicksand.

  


Faces began to appear outside the cockpit window.

  


Not passengers. Not people I knew.

  


*People I’d wronged and hurt.*

  


They stared at me, not with anger, but with *pity.*

  


And that look of pity was worse.

  


The cockpit lights dimmed. Emergency backup kicked in, barely a glow.

  


Captain Philip stood up, unbuckled, and looked me square in the eye.

  


“Some of us must pay,” he said. “To leave this place, there must be balance. There must be a sacrifice.”

  


“What place?” I begged. “What have we done?”

  


He opened the cockpit door and stepped out.

  


But not into the cabin.

  


He walked into *nothing.*

  


A howling darkness, and yet… it *took* him. Like he belonged to it. His body disintegrated. No scream. Just gone.

  


I lunged, but it was like grabbing vapor.

  


I turned back. The cabin behind me was gone. Just more blackness.

  


Then the radio sparked to life.

  


A child’s voice.

  


No—*my daughter’s* voice.

  


“We require a sacrifice,” she said. “You must choose.”

  


“Choose what?” I begged.

  


The voice changed. Bent. Warped. Her tone twisted into something cruel, maybe even ancient.

  


“Your life… or the passengers’.” It said with a sound of cruel hunger behind its voice.

  


I wept. I thought of my wife. My daughter. I thought of the lives behind that cockpit door that was no longer there.

  


And still, the voice demanded:

  


“Choose.”

  


My hand trembled on the yoke.

  


“*ME!*” I screamed.

  


Then I woke up under fluorescent lights.

  


A hospital ceiling above me. My wife beside the bed, clutching my hand.

  


Later that day, government officials came to speak with me.

  


There had been a crash.

  


Flight 237 went down outside Cheyenne.

  


Half the passengers survived—because of what they called *my bravery.*

  


Captain Philip’s body was never recovered.

  


They called me a hero. Said I saved lives.

  


But I know the truth.

  


I traded half the souls on that plane for my own.

  


That thing won’t let me forget.

  


Because when my daughter speaks now, I flinch. 

  


There's a weight behind her words-something just slightly off. A rhythm not her own. A tone that doesn't belong in a child's throat.

  


It sounds like her. But it isn't.

Nobody else hears what I hear when she speaks.

  


Whatever it was, it didn't need my death. It needed my permission.

  


It left my body intact, but I feel it moving behind my eyes. In the quiet moments. In the dark. 

  


I left that plane, but I also left fragments of my souls behind as well.

  


And sometimes, when I sleep, I hear it whisper:

"We never said you could leave."
