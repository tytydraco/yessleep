  
Hey guys, I've got more to update you on. I've got some incense burning and salt around my room so..i should be safe enough to write this without worrying. If you haven't read part 1, here's the link:[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17zdv6e/my_family_recently_moved_into_a_new_house/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

  
It doesn't like that I'm telling people about it. I don't know what it is, but I know it doesn't like it. Every time I start to write about my experiences, I can hear it laughing at me. My battery dies after only a short period of time and my computer glitches out constantly. I'm not giving up on telling you guys about this though. It wants me to give up, and that's just not like me.   
You guys are my only hope. Even if I don't make it out.. Maybe I can prevent someone else from getting in the same situation as I'm in.  
After my last post, I decided to try out some of the suggestions in the comments. I had a few people ask me if I could try taking a picture of the stairwell, so I went and did just that. As soon as I pulled up my camera on my phone though, something happened that I've never seen before. It was like.. The stairwell was a blurred out mess. It was like someone had tried to censor it but did a really bad job at it. No matter how far away I got from it, it just stayed like that. It didn't stay in one place though, it was moving along with me. I tried taking pictures of it but I noticed my phone battery suddenly draining very quickly, and when I went to charge it, the photos didn't even show up in my camera roll. It was like they had never existed.  
Another suggestion was that I try leaving a bible on the staircase. My family has never really been the religious type, so I had to go out and buy a bible. I think it was the uh.. New international version? I never knew there were different versions of the bible, the more you know i guess. When I got home, I immediately walked over to the staircase and walked up to the door. I realize I didn't mention this earlier, but the staircase is pretty long and windy. I think I counted 42 steps? You can't see the door from the bottom, since there's a curve in the stairwell.   
Soon I began hearing this sound. At first I couldn't make it out, but the closer I got to the door, the louder it got. I realized it sounded like.. Laughter. It wasn't human laughter though i..i don't know how to describe it.. It sounded so.. Off. like it was doing a really shitty job at trying to imitate a human's laughter. Oh! I've got it! Have you ever heard parrots talk? Sometimes they sound fine, and other times there's just…something off. It sounded kind of like that.   
Despite this freaking the living shit out of me, I kept walking up the stairs to the door. I paused, listening to the uncanny laughter for a few moments before knowing on the door. The laughter stopped, silence filling the empty space it left behind.  I started to get this horrible feeling, like a paranoia, so I set the book down and booked it (no pun intended). As soon as I set it down, the laughter surrounded me from all sides. It was  like it was behind me, a mile away, and in my head. like it was everywhere, all at once. I got to the bottom of the stairs, panting, and realized the laughter had stopped.   
‘Thank god..’ I muttered, still gasping for air.   
I went back up to my room and decided to do some research. I know a few of you asked me to do research on the house, but I'm saving that for later. My first priority right now is survival, and that means figuring out how to deal with this thing.   
I tried looking up ‘paranormal activity’ and went down a rabbit hole of this and that. Most of the sites either bring me to weird cult-ish groups, or to church sites. I did give most of the church sites a look through, and some of them were helpful, while others told me the devil was inside my head, and that the devil was making me mentally ill, schizophrenia is the product of the devil… ect ect.   
I came across a few witch-tok’s, and those oddly enough, seemed to be my best bet.   
After doing about an hour of research, I went out to go get my supplies. I didn't care if I seemed crazy, or if they didn't work. I wasn't betting on the fact they would work, I just knew it was worth a shot. If they didn't work, then so be it. If they did, then that made my life a whole lot easier.   
Maybe I could finally get some sleep at night for fuck’s sake.   
My first stop was a crystal shop. I've never really been a believer in all this stuff but, hey, if it had a chance of helping I was willing to try it out. The cashier welcomed me and I went about searching for the items I needed. Selenite, black salt, incense, and protection pendants. Now, after about 30 minutes in there, a lady came out from the back. She seemed to be maybe in her early 40’s, with brown, curly hair and adorned with crystal jewelry.  
‘Jessica? What's going on?’ she asked the cashier.  
   
‘What do you mean..nothing happened really. We just have a-’  
‘Customer.’ the lady interrupted, looking at me.   
‘Jessica, I need you to burn some incense asap. Cleanse out the store.’  
‘O..kay?’ Jessica said, going to the back to grab the supplies.  
    
‘Jack, right?’   
I looked up at her in shock. ‘How do you…know my name?’ I said, bewildered.   
‘you're in need of some serious help, aren't you?’ she asked, looking me dead in the eyes with a serious expression.   
‘I…yes, actually.’  
Jessica came out from the back, incense in hand. As soon as the incense hit my skin, I began coughing.   
‘Gah, what the.. The fuck?’ I managed to say between my coughing fits.   
‘It'll leave soon, don't worry. It seems to be very attached to you.’  
I looked at her in confusion, but after about a minute, my coughing resided. I was going to ask her what she meant by that, but I didn't get a chance before she changed the subject.   
‘Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Alyssa, I'm the owner of this place. As soon as you came in I could feel it following you… god it looked so much worse than I had imagined. I've never seen something so…’ Alyssa looked down, seemingly still trying to process what she saw.   
‘But it's gone now so..we don't have to worry about it for now. I see you've already got some selenite in your basket. I think you're going to need a lot more than that..’ she said quietly, walking over to the shelves and grabbing more of the shiny white crystal.   
‘I'm sorry i- it's okay, I can't afford all that-’ I tried to say, but she cut me off.   
‘Its free.’  
‘Ex..cuse me? What? Aren't you trying to run a business here?’ I said, confused out of my mind now. What the hell was going on?  
‘Well yes, I am trying to run a business, but I also would rather not see your name in the newspaper as a ‘missing person’ and know I could've helped.. Or at least tried to.’  
Cold shivers were sent down my spine. I did my best to ignore it and after I collected the rest of my supplies, I went to the catholic church to get some holy water.   
I stepped into the building, and asked a nearby passerby where I would be able to find the fountain. They pointed me over to the stone carved fountain, and I collected some of the water. After that, I went back home, feeling like this was all some sort of fever dream.   
I got inside and realized that my mom was out shopping. I had a few people ask me what happened to my dad and, well, his new job has got him really busy, so he's not home very often. I don't really talk to him much anyways, so I'm not too close with him.  
I took this chance to rummage through the cabinets that we had unpacked, searching for the papers to the house. After about 20 minutes of searching, I found them. They were in a blue folder, typical for my mother. She loved keeping things filed away.  
I opened the folder and the first thing I saw were the blueprints to the house. Not really to my surprise, in the blueprints there was no attic, just a wall.. Just like the firefighters had said.   
I flipped through the pages, looking at the agreements. On the last page, I noticed the listing the house had been at.   
$34,000 USD, OLD BRICK HOME, HEAT AND ELECTRICITY.  
I stared at the number. Now, I may only be 15, but I know how much houses go for these days. A house this size should be at LEAST 10x that price, at $340,000. Maybe it was a mistype?   
I kept scanning the papers for any more clues, and I found my parents signature. I read the paragraph above.   
‘I agree to all the terms and conditions and have read all the requirements of owning this property. By signing here, I acknowledge that I will follow the conditions listed above. I understand that if I sign here and do not comply with such conditions, I will be fined up to $50,000 USD per violation. I understand that if I violate more than 5 of these rules, the following consequences may be imposed.  
\-incarceration   
\-loss of property  
\-job loss  
\-loss of family members  
I stared at the last one.  What the hell do they mean by that? What kind of twisted- they can’t kill us, right? That's gotta be illegal, right?  
I looked below, hoping to god that i hadn't seen their signatures before and it was just my imagination. Despite how much I prayed that they weren't there, they were, and I couldn't do anything about it.   
I scanned the rest of the papers, looking for the requirements. After about a minute or so, I found them.  They are as transcribed below  
1: no renovations are to be done to the house. This property is considered to be a historical site, and violation of this rule will result in a fine.   
2: We request that you do not smoke while on property. violation of this will result in a cleaning fee.   
3: trash is to be disposed of in the dumpster. Failure to do so will result in a cleaning fee.   
4: cats are not allowed on the premises.   
5: if any furnishings in the building are to be harmed or broken in any way, do not contact anyone else but us. We will fix them. If you try to fix them yourself, or hire another company to do so, consequences may be waiting.   
I stared at the fifth rule for what seemed to be an eternity. What do they mean by that? Why can't we fix it ourselves? What's going to happen if we do? Do they just not want to have competition?  And why aren't cats allowed, but dogs are? Maybe they're just really big dog people..? Who knows. I continued reading.  
6: if you hear knocking from the attic, do not investigate. *There is no attic.*   
7: Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to try and open the attic door.   
8: you are not to mention the existence of an attic to any outsiders. If any outsiders are to investigate and see the stairwell, the property is to be demolished asap, with all affected inside.   
9: By signing this contract, you agree to reside in this house for a year or longer. Failure to do so will result in termination.   
Termination? What do they mean? Did they just forget to write ‘of contract’ after? Or was that what they meant when they said ‘loss of family members’?   
This situation seems to just be getting worse and worse by the day. Was this some sort of sick joke? Was this a city-wide thing they did to the new neighbors, trying to convince them they are crazy?   
Well, at least I know I'm not crazy and that the attic is mentioned in the documents, even if they're saying it ‘doesn't exist’.  
I heard my mom pulling back into the driveway, so I quickly filed the papers back where I found them and went up to my room. I put the salt around my room, and lit some incense. At first it burned, but it got better after a while.   
That night I actually got some sleep, which I was eternally grateful for. The next morning, I decided to go check on that bible I had put up there, and put some selenite on the steps.   
As soon as I got to the stairwell, something felt.. Wrong. I walked up the stairs and when I reached the door, I saw the bible, torn and burnt to a crisp. Above the now burnt book, on the door, were words that seemed to be burned into the door itself, despite it being metal.   
‘Nice try’ they spelled out.   
I stared at the words in horror for a few minutes, trying to process the scene before me. I decided to leave the bible there, and place the selenite on the steps and get the hell out of there.   
When I got down the stairs, my head was racing with thoughts. Is that why it was laughing? Was it laughing at me? Will the selenite work? How dangerous is this thing? How did it burn a metal door?  
After that, I went up to my room and sat there for a few hours, trying to process the situation I was in.   
The activity is getting worse too, and I think it's because I'm telling you guys about it. Every time i start to write about my experiences, I can hear laughter from above me, and scratching coming from my ceiling. I'll catch glimpses of things from the corner of my eye, or hear something whisper my name. It’s all got me very paranoid.  
The nightmares are getting worse too. They keep getting more and more vivid, though the pendants I bought and incense seem to help a little. Every time I wake up from them, there's a burn mark on my neck, like someone was trying to rip off the pendant necklace.  
I've started to draw out the building the nightmares take place in, to try and get a better grasp of it. It's definitely an old school, but it seems unfinished. What's really odd is it's not like any school I've seen, the desks are thinner and only have two legs, which are metal. The windows have these bars on them and the window panes themselves are small rectangular pieces of glass that are about the size of my hand. Each window consists of about 10 of these small rectangles, placed between the bars.   
The walls seem to have been painted a dark green before, but most of the paint has peeled off. I don't think it's due to age though, and it still seems like a pretty modern school, despite the shape it's in. it's like.. The elements are affecting it much faster than they should.   
After drawing out the building to the best of my ability, I tried to look up any similar buildings. It took me about an hour of ignoring scratching at my door, tapping at my window and cold breezes against my neck to find it.   
It was about 20 minutes out from town, in the middle of a prairie. I looked for more information but.. There's no records of it being built or even existing before 10 years ago. It's almost like it just…appeared out of nowhere.   
I've decided I'm going to go explore it tomorrow. I know it's probably a bad idea but it's the only lead I have on trying to figure out what this thing is, and why it keeps bringing me back to that place. I'm going to bring some flashlights, a candle and lots of incense, hopefully that’ll help.   
If anyone has heard of this building before or has any information about it, please let me know.   
Until then.
