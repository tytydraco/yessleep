 Warmth was a stranger, and a cruel one at that. Gnarled, icy fingers clawed at my skin. The cold enveloped me with the finality of the grave, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

 As my eyes slowly opened, I stared into the inky void above me. Snow flakes began to fall from the heavens, blurring my vision. Willing myself to move, I lifted my head and looked around. Trees surrounded me on all sides. Fear ignited a fire within me, but alas no warmth came from it.

Where am I, and how did I get here? My memory bank was defunct. And what’s worse, a gnawing, aching, hunger raged in my belly.

Scanning the tree line, I caught sight of a light, somewhere off in the depth of the wood. I needed help. Warmth. Something to soothe the ache in my belly.

One foot in front of the other, I trudged through the snow and muck, my body feeling to heavy for my bones. The sensation of tv static ran from my toes to my hair follicles, sending chills up my spine.

The light grew closer, and I hungrier as I could make out the visage of a cozy cabin, it’s windows lit up with the promise of life, and warmth. This hastened my pace a bit, and before long I was at its door, awaiting my reprieve.

I knocked as hard as I could, and rather quickly, a concerned looking woman came to the door. Her concern turned to terror as our eyes met.

Suddenly I could remember everything. The party. The dark twinkle in Cassie’s eye as she led me into the woods. The glint of the blade as she raised it, over, and over, and over. My cries of pain and agony. Her and my other supposed “Sister in Blood” throwing my still breathing body in the dirt.

I also remember the dark thing , and it’s  crooked maw that whispered promises of vengeance, and blood, and power. I remember meeting the True One, and how he breathed his darkness into me and ate my pain. 

How he told me the secrets of all the dank, dark places. I could remember everything.

 There she stood before me, and I could almost taste her fear. It was divine. “ Hello Sister Cassie. How have you been?” There was a different twinkle in her eye now... “M… Sister Maria? How are you…how did you?” She stuttered.

“You’re supposed to be dead.” She looked down at her hands. “ With these hands, I ended you myself. You were nothing but unwilling flesh for my willing blade.” She spat.

I took step towards her, hatred and disgust dripping off of every word. “ The True One saw fit to bleed life back into me, after you had bled it out.” I took another step, salivating at the meal before me. 

“Dear sister, please let me in, you don’t know what kind of monsters are out there.”
I begged mockingly.

And then I pounced.
