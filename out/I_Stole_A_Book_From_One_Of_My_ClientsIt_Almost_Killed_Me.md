In Hindsight...This Was A Terrible Idea. I was WARNED and Told By People To NOT Try Communication With "It"...But I was Too Curious...I Was Too "Intrigued".

&#x200B;

I Had Woken Up Early That Morning, I Had Some Eggs and I realized that I was running out of food...Maybe I should Have Taken This Month To Find Another Job.

I Entered my room cautiously, wanting to not make my presence known. I opened my drawer to realize that the book and key...were gone.

I opened the other drawers but to my horror, the book had melted through the floor without me noticing it. I ran downstairs and I had missed a large hole in my floor. I peer'd into the hole and it was burning through the concrete in my basement. I had to be quick to get the book.

I ran into the basement and the book was sizzling through the concrete floor. I rushed to it but realized I didn't have my protective gloves... That didn't matter to me at the time, I Could not let the book and key escape.

I reached my hand into the burning concrete and felt a searing pain throughout my whole body. I kept reaching farther down. I rammed my fingers down, trying to get it over with but the hole was getting deeper by the second, Half of my arm was in the hole now, My brain screamed at me to stop but I pushed on, Now almost my entire arm reached into the hole. 

It seemed hopeless but I felt the texture of the book. I reached further, My entire arm reaching into the hole but it was not enough, I kept pushing, trying my best to reach just a little further before it was too late.

My burning arm stretches and grasped at the edges of the book, I Yelled out in pain as the burning sensation felt similar to being set on fire. Tears streamed down my eyes as I kept reaching, hoping against hope that It would reach far enough and it wasn't for nothing...

Suddenly The Hole Started Sucking me into it. At First I thought my brain was imagining things because of the extreme pain I was in but no, The hole was starting to suck me into it at an alarming rate.

I screamed for help but nobody heard me. I didn't care about the book or the key anymore, Now it was a fight for survival.

I pulled and tugged but the hole was tightening and constraining my arm along with tugging me deeper into the burning concrete. 

&#x200B;

It was a trap and I Fell for it.

&#x200B;

My shoulder was no longer visible and I no longer could feel my lower arm. Tears streamed down my face as my voice was tired from screaming.

I closed my eyes, accepting my fate. My entire life was flashing before my eyes; people I knew and loved and places I've been and Dreams from the past.

&#x200B;

I winced as the blinding lights confused me, was I in heaven? No. I was not in heaven, I was in the hospital. 

I went to get up and use my right arm to sustain myself but I cried out in anguish as my arm screamed at me to go back into a more comfortable position.

I felt a familiar book in my hand which was now slightly burnt and to my shock, The key was nowhere to be seen.

Was it all a dream? A hallucination? I thought to myself as a nurse walked in. She looked to be in her late 20's, blonde hair and green eyes. She wore a nurse outfit, obviously along with glasses that were a bit big for her. She had a sea-shell necklace and wore tight,black shoes. She had freckles and had this warm smile that was only seen on waiters.

"Sir, Your Awake"! She announced.

"I'm aware". I said, annoyed.

"How are you feeling"? She asked, ignoring my tone.

"I'm Fine" I said quickly, wanting to end this conversation quickly.

"Well, We found you having a seizure in your basement and your arm in the furnace". She said sullenly.

"So it was a dream"? I asked.

"What Dream"? She asked, clearly intrigued.

"Nothing". I said, looking away.

She stared at me, waiting for an answer... I didn't elaborate.

"Well... We found traces of metal all the way from your fingers to your shoulder, we can remove it but it's pricey and it doesn't seem to be affecting anything right now". She said, reading off a clipboard.

It took me a couple seconds to register what this meant. I turned pale and stared at my hand, which now was housing the key.

"Are You Ok Kyle"? She asked.

"How do you know my name"?! I asked quickly but pretty loudly.

"You don't need to shout at me. It's on your medical papers, do you go by a different name than your birth certificate"? She asked.

"What, no. I just- Never mind". I sighed.

"I'm Emily Michone". She said, extending her arm to shake with my right hand but then she quickly stopped, realizing that my arm was injured. "sorry" She said awkwardly.

"It's fine" I sighed.

"So, whats with the book in your hand? You held it tightly all the way here". She said, raising an eyebrow at me.

"Look, IF I tell you what's going on, you can't tell anyone else". I said, wanting to tell someone my troubles other than online but also wanting to not get sent to the insane asylum.

"Not even the doctor treating you"? She asked.

"Nobody". I said flatly.

"Fine, Go ahead". She said, rolling her eyes but listening in.

"This book I'm holding. It's cursed or something. It's been terrorizing me for about a month" I started.

"Go on...". She said, seemingly interested.

"I was a therapist and I got the book from one of my patients before he went... "crazy". I said.

"How long did they have the book"? She asked.

"A Week", I said grimly.

"So how do you know you're not crazy too"? She pondered.

"I honestly don't know". I sighed.

"Well, go on". She said, taking a seat in one of the stools, her blonde hair swaying in the small breeze from the open window.

"I had the book for a couple days but one of my co-workers had the key, which is now in my arm". I said.

"Wait so the metal is the key to the book"?! She asked, surprised.

"I'm pretty sure, yeah". I confessed.

"So, anyway, the key had told my co-worker to steal the book I had and well..." I started again.

"He broke into your house"?! She asked, appalled.

"Yea and he tried killing me too". I went on... "And Then I had the key and book for almost a month". I finished.

"Why didn't you open it"? She asked.

"I don't know, it just had this energy coming from it. Also it was slowly burning through the dresser drawer I was keeping it in. I eventually wanted to try communicating to the book and key, but...I guess I had some hallucination because The book didn't make a hole in my basement like I dreamed". I rambled.

"There was". She said.

"Wait- but you said I had a seizure"? I asked.

"I did, but there was also this hole in the floor. The police said it was probably some miniature sink hole". She confessed.

"Sink hole?! IT'S CONCRETE"! I exclaimed.

She shrugged and turned to look at my arm.

"Should I take the bandages off"? I asked, yawning.

"No, you gotta wait 10 days before it's safe to do so". She said quickly.

I sighed and waited as 10 days passed by. Not much happened at that time but I was unable to tell people what was happening, online. I shared more info with Emily Michone and we eventually became friends.

At the end of the 10 days, Me and Emily Uncovered the bandages to a burned arm,hand and shoulder. I could finally move it without pain but It still stung from time to time. 

What I didn't tell Emily was that during the 10 days, the key was talking to me through my head. Telling me horrible things like how it would kill Emily and everyone I knew. I mostly Ignored the key but I snapped at it a couple times and It revealed to me its name, "Gorgen Oritero". 

I didn't think a key would have a name but...At this point the key wasn't really a key anymore, to me, it was a pest.

I got Emily's phone so we could keep in touch and we texted each other as I drove home. She arranged to meet up a week from now since she had to attend her sister's wedding, but after that she would be able to help me with my "problem".

I feel like there might be hope for me yet, but I don't have enough money to remove the key from my arm, and I doubt it will leave my arm unless It's forced to. I don't know if I can handle it's insane rambling much longer.

I also got mail from George Rintoro. He wanted to meet up again and he had some "good news" to share with me.

I'll try to report back to you all soon.
