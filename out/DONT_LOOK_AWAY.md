Please listen to me. Anyone who is reading this DON'T LOOK AWAY FROM YOUR SCREEN. It doesn't matter where you are and what you are doing. Stare at whatever you are looking. If you are on your phone keep looking, if you are on your laptop keep looking. Whatever happens don't look away. You can blink but you can't close your eyes for more than 5 seconds. If you do it'll get you. The entity can't harm you if you keep looking here. I don't know if it's here or not and I can't take risks. 

*Look over*

That's not me please read this carefully. I think I summoned this entity. I knew I shouldn't have had watched that video. It's called "Something fun, watch it at your own risk". It's no more available. I thought it was just a joke and I watched. Biggest mistake which may take my life. How I know this is real?. My friend is laying dead right in front of me. I can see her unmoving legs. Her last words were, "don't look away". It's been 2days thankfully my phone was charging when I watched that video. My eyes are tried. But if I close it I'll probably be a part of the entity.

*She is lying. Look away it's okay*

No I am not lying. Please there is only one way to get rid of this entity. KEEP LOOKING WHATEVER YOU ARE LOOKING AT. The video said that's the only way. It said after some days or weeks or months or maybe a year, it'll get bored of you and leave you but it will stay around its prey for the same amount of time. I am not safe yet, I can see it now. It's right behind me I can see it's face, it's reflecting on my phone screen. I have never seen anything this scary and hideous. It has its massive hand on my shoulder, I can feel it. I can feel sharp blade like fingers around my neck. One move and I'll sure be decapitated. The teeth, that eye... Even if I make it out alive I'll never forget this face. 

Will I make it alive? It doesn't matter I need to let everyone know about this entity.

*There is no entity. Look away*

Please if you know someone who can help. Someone who can take this entity away from this earth please help me. Maybe it's too late for me but please let everyone know there is some entity haunting this world. 
Wait it's not there anymore. I can't see it on my phone screen. Am I safe now? Should I turn around??. I can't feel the hand anymore. A few seconds earlier I could feel the presence of something unnatural but now everything seems okay. I can still see my friend's dead leg but I really don't know if I should take the risk. 

My eyes cannot open anymore. I think I should look away now. LISTEN EVERYONE stay still, 2 days and a few hours and you may be able to live. I'll turn around now, if I make it out alive I'll edit this post if I don't DON'T LOOK AWAY.
