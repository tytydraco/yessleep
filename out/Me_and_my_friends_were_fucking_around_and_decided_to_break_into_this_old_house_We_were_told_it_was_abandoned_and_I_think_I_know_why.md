It was one time. One. Fucking. Time. Supposed to be an in and out thing, not all this.

Look, I'm scared and confused, okay? Rod's gone, so are Rachel and Kevin. It took 'em, and God only help them, wherever the hell they are now. What we did wasn't right, but we don't deserve *this*! We're fucking kids!

We just wanted one night out together. Graduation was next week and we wanted to celebrate one last hoorah together before we all split our separate ways. Rachel and Kev were going to a university out of state, while Rod was going into the military. I was the only scrub that'd still be sitting here in Weeping Willow, N.C. I *could've* gotten a way into Uni, but I said "Screw that" and figured I'd do something online or something.

Anyway, so the four of us were at lunch, reminiscing about all the stupid shit we used to do, right, like when Rod and I toilet papered the English teacher's car, or when he and Kev managed to actually get the entire senior class to do a walk out onto the field for a "Strip tease on the football field" (No, it wasn't real, yes, the *entire* senior class took the bait -- it was funny). Well, Rachel then started getting all emotional, you know, sniffing and crying and all that, talking about how she was gonna miss us and shit. Of course, Kev and Rod tried telling her that "We'd always be there for each other" and gave her the whole "We'll keep in touch" and the "We'll make sure to hang out when we can". Basically, all the bullshit lines from a bad RomCom movie, classic bullshit that we all knew wasn't gonna be true. We'd be split our separate ways and that'd be that. We'd move on with our fucking lives while still holding the memories until we get too old to remember what we ate for breakfast that morning.

I knew this, too, and instead of trying to bullshit her about "always keeping in touch", my stupid ass decided, in its infinite wisdom, to instead come up with the idea to pull off one more stunt for old times sake. "Hey, you remember that old house at the end of the neighborhood?" I asked. Rachel looked up at me, her eyes still wet.

"Yeah, what about it?" she asked. Kev and Rod looked at me now.

"Which house?" Rod asked.

"The one at the end of Willow Ln., dude." He cocked his eyebrows at me.

"You mean old man Caine's place?"

"No, dude, the other one, the one farther down from that."

He looked to the side for a moment before going "Oh, shit, yeah, I think I know what you're talking about."

"What about it?" Kev asked.

"You know how it's abandoned, right?" The three of them nodded their heads at me. "So I was thinking, what if we camped out there this Friday night and videoed us trashing the place and upload it to YouTube." Kev and Rod's eyes immediately went wide with excitement. Rachel's on the other hand, looked skeptically at me.

"Wait, just up and trash the place? That's it?"

"Yeah. It'd be awesome! We'd even burn it down when we were done, use it as a campfire." I snickered at my own wit. Yeah, real fucking *genius* I was. She wasn't convinced by this.

"So wait, you're talking about demolishing private property *and* committing arson?"

"Well, I mean... No one lives there. Come on, it'll be fine, I promise."

"Yo, count me in!" Exclaimed Kev. "I still got a couple cans of gasoline and I could scrounge up some styrofoam, make some napalm ad we'll *really* play "Light my fire"." He, Kev, and I all cheered while going in for a group high-five. We stopped though when we saw that Rachel hadn't joined in.

"Rache, come on, you in?" I asked. She sat still, looking at the three of us like the idiots we were and have always been, before snickering and declaring "Fuck it" and joining in the high five. "It's settled then; Friday night, say 9:30, 10-ish, we'll all meet up at the old house."

"Hell yeah!" shouted Kev. Rod whooped and cheered. Rachel rolled her eyes with a smirk that said, "Yep, we were idiots, but *her* idiots." She was easily the most mature of us. Kev, me and Rod always kind of thought of her as the sort of "big sister" of our little clique. Oh, don't get me wrong, she was right there with us dudes, doing stupid shit -- it was *her,* believe it or not, that gave Kev and Rod the whole "Football field strip club" prank idea in the first place -- but she was of course a little better at being more "behind the scenes" with her shenanigans, you know? Both a bad influence, as well as our best one. She'd give us the ideas to get into trouble (usually), but also help us get right back out.

So that was how it started. One last score. One last prank that'd be worth looking back on for when either of us would get lonely. Well, I'll say this much, if only in a very ironically fucked up way; we technically accomplished *that* goal. Neither of us forgot, and especially now, we never can.

The rest of that week came and went, even if it felt longer to us at the time because neither of us really cared about *actually* being there. It was the end of the year, what'd you expect, for us to give a shit? Well, Friday rolls around, and I almost forgot completely (I know, I know, irony itself has a sense of humor, don't it?), until I start getting messages from Kev.

**-- "Yo, you sure you still wantin' to burn the place down?"**

After the shockwave of memory washed over me, I began typing.

\-- "Yeah man, You still got the stuff for it, right?"

**-- "Yeah man, but uhh..."**

\-- "What?"

I sat there for about a minute with no reply before suddenly getting a call from him.

"Yo, what's up?" I answer, slightly confused.

"Hey man, listen. Rachel and I have been talking about tonight." I noticed how concerned his voice sounded.

"Okay..."

"Well, here's the thing. Rachel's been digging around and apparently, the place was abandoned after it caught fire, killing the last family that lived there."

"Huh?"

"Yeah, she's even got the old news article about it, here, I'll send it to you."

"Wait, how long ago?"

"I think the article said that was sometime in the late 80's, early 90's or something like that."

I frowned. "Dude, what are you talking about? You and I both grew up here in Willow Ln. That house had someone living there when we were kids, which was long after that. How could the place have been abandoned for that long?"

"That's just it, dude. You're right, I do remember people living there back then."

"And I don't remember any fires either."

"No, but here's the thing. I don't remember ever seeing those people outside the house, either."

"So, what, are you saying somebody still lives in the place?"

"No... I don't know, dude. I'm just saying *maybe* we should do like Rachel said and hold off on the pyromania this time."

*"Dude*," I whined, "that's what's supposed to make this gig. The whole point was to go out with some fireworks." A moment passed in an awkward silence before I sighed and said, "Look man, I promise, if something happens, you know I'll have y'alls backs, right?"

I heard him sigh. "Yeah man, I-I know." I grinned.

"So, you still bringing the gas can and the Styrofoam?"

"Yeah..." I cackled deviously. "Seriously, though, I think you should at least look at this. Weird stuff, man."

"Yeah, yeah, Mom, I get it. See you in an hour."

"See ya." He replied with an exasperated sigh before hanging up. I passed the next hour by gathering some last minute supplies, a.k.a. a crap ton of junk food and my vape. At one point, I stopped and thought about something. Kev said that the family hadn't left that house after the fire he mentioned.

Now, I'd lived on Willow Ln. my entire life, and not once had I ever seen anyone outside of that house, but I knew that someone was living there because I remembered how there would still be mail delivered regularly to the place. And before you wanna be a smartass, yeah, I know that sometimes houses without tenants may still have mail get delivered to the address, but if that were the case, the mail would've been overflowing the mailbox, wouldn't it? Wouldn't the mailbox be unable to ever fit any other letters after about a month or so?

Well, needless to say, that wasn't the case. I always remember it was on the same day, the same time, and it was the *same damn* truck that'd do it, too. It was an old as hell looking UPS truck, on a Friday night, and that house would be the only one in Willow Ln. it'd stop at. It was something I'd always sort of wondered about, you know, like, *why* does the mailman deliver to a house that doesn't ever come out to get their mail or why don't they come out. A small curiosity, though, not something I spent too much time thinking about.

And to be fair, something you have to realize about Ol' Willow Ln. is that it's *never* been a loud place to be. I remember, growing up here, there weren't many kids at all to play with (Which, by the way, means that no, no one was stealing the mail, either). If there *were* other kids around, I hardly noticed outside of Kev and the other two. I got lucky with them.

No, Willow Ln. was about as stereotypical as it gets when it came to "Quiet suburban neighborhood". Hell, I'm almost surprised there weren't white picket fences connecting each house to the next. And, outside of a few rumors, and the thing about old man Caine's place and something about children disappearing or some shit, people didn't really have any sort of problems about the place, either, that I could remember anyway. In short, what Kev told me about the fire was the first time I'd ever heard of anything like that about the house.

I looked at my phone and saw that he'd texted me a snapshot of the article from Google. It didn't say much, just that the house caught fire one night and it wasn't reported that anyone made it out. Didn't say how the fire was caused, either, just that it devastated the place and that it was huge. Of course, that brought to mind the question, how is it still there if the fire "devastated" it. This got gears turning in my head.

What if, instead of just a huge ass bonfire, we go on a little mystery hunt? I grabbed my old GoPro and flashlights. I figured, what *if* something was there? What if there were ghosts or whatever, lingering around the place? We'd have proof and we'd be a hit in the lunchrooms and hallways of the school. Yeah, how's that for a sendoff; Ghost hunt and a bonfire -- we weren't abandoning *that* idea, that'd make sense, and we can't have that. If we could, this wouldn't be necessary, would it?

Anyway, it's about 9:45 and my folks had just left for their date night. That was another reason I picked this night in particular. For the past 3 years up to that point, once I'd turned 15, they'd made it a point to go out once a month and spend at least one night and most of the next day out, leaving me at the house alone. I waited about five minutes before grabbing my stuff and making my way down the street to the house. I ended up running into Rod on the way.

"Hey man, what's up?" he called out. "Yo, did Kev talk to you?"

"I mean, yeah, but why?"

"He told me something about some fire or something. He tell you that?"

"Yeah."

"Weird, ain't it. I mean, how's that even possible?"

"I said the same thing, man. I mean, did *you* ever see a family in that house?" He shook his head.

"Huh-uh, and if the place'd caught fire, how's it still there. I don't remember ever seeing any renovations to it, do you?" I shook my head.

"I don't know, man, I wanna check it out, though."

"What do you mean?" I rummaged through my bag and pulled out my GoPro, grinning.

"What's say we have ourselves a little ghost hunt?" He stared at me in disbelief before looking aimlessly around. "What? What are you looking for?"

"The Mystery Machine, dude, cause, uh..." He pointed to the camera, "Ghost hunt, really?"

"What's wrong with that, dude? What if something's there? Wouldn't you wanna be the one going around school with live evidence of something spooky like that?" His eyebrows further raised before sighing.

"What happened to the bonfire, man? What, did Kev scare you out of it?"

"No, dude, we're still gonna burn the fucker. I just wanna have a little fun in the place, first."

"I see." he said, forming a devious looking grin on his face that matched mine. "You wanna see the ghosts, stir up the nest, then torch 'em back to Hell or wherever..."

"And we can graduate as the kids that fought off ghosts one night!" I chimed in. The two of us howled to the air while going in for a high-five. With adrenaline now pumping full-blast in our veins, Rod and I all but sprited the rest of the way down the street to the house. Kev and Rachel already there, waiting beside Kev's truck outside the house.

"We thought you guys got lost." remarked Kev. Rod and I rolled our eyes. He was always being a smartass.

"Oh please," retorted Rachel, "We've *barely* been here five fuckin' minutes." He just snickered.

"So, we all ready?" I asked. Kev held up his bag in one hand and the gas can in the other, grinning. "Awesome."

"Yo, tell 'em about your little plan." Rod exclaimed. Kev and Rachel looked at me, intrigued. I pulled my GoPro back out. I saw their faces twist in confusion.

"Bro, it's the dead-ass of night." Kev chided. "The hell are you planning on trying to take pictures of?"

Rachel rolled her eyes and said, "I mean, this *is* supposed to be a *memorial* fling, right?" Kev turned to her.

"Well, yeah, but you *really* wanna have a pic on hand of us burning some random house down?" He started tapping his index finger on his temple and remarked, "Yeah, *real* smart. "Yeah officer, we did that shit, and we have the photo to prove--" I cut him off.

"Actually, wise-ass, this is for something else. Actually, we can thank *you* for giving the idea to me in the first place." His eyebrow raised in confusion. "You got me thinking, what if there's someone in there?"

He did a double-take over his shoulder over toward the house and back to me, pointing at the house. "Think about it, no one ever saw anybody leave, right?" He and Rachel kept looking at me like I was absolutely nuts. "So that means either A, they're still here, somewhere, or B, they died in that fire, which means their ghosts might still be still be hanging around, you know?"

"Or C, you had one too many hits from your bowl before hiking out here." Kev retorted. "Look, what happened to camping out and burning the house down?"

"Chill, dude, we're still gonna do that, I just thought we'd have a little bit of extra fun before we did." He pinched the bridge of his nose and scoffed.

"I don't see why not." Rod chimed in.

"Well no shit, I *know* your dumb ass would be up for it. I'm *certain* YOU took one too many hits."

"Screw you, I only had a brownie before I left." Kev snickered.

"Enough, guys." Rachel said. She turned to me. "Look, I'm all cool with ghost hunts and I wanna hang and all, but I *really* think we should reconsider trying to burn the house down."

"Rache, come on, I promise, there's nothing to worry about. It'll be awesome."

"Be a lot more awesome if we'd just stick to the original plan and left out the ghost hunt." I turned and gave Kev an annoyed look. He just shrugged and I turned back to Rachel.

She sighed and said, "I'm with you guys, either way, okay. I mean it. I just wanna make sure we're being careful, you know?"

"I know, I know, and I promise, we are." She sighed and nodded, relenting.

"I'm down!" Rod cheered. "Kev?"

"I'm good as long as we're still sending the place to the pits of Hell afterward."

"Bro, like I told you on the phone, that's the main event of the night, baby!" I whooped to the sky, Rod joining in.

"Alright, alright, ya baboons, can we at least go inside now. I need to sit down."

"Yeah, I agree, we don't need to all be standing *outside* the abandoned house. Don't need to make it any easier for people to think we're fuckin' creeps." We gathered our stuff then and headed inside.

This was where our first surprise about the house kicked in. As soon as we walked into the door, the three of us were slapped in the face with a massive wave of heat. "What the fuck?" Kev exclaimed. "Hot damn, why's it so hot in here?"

"Who turned on the heat?" Rod asked.

"There's no heat here, idiot. Remember, "abandoned?" I didn't show it like he was, but I was honestly wondering the same thing. How in the hell could there be *this* kind of heat -- or really any heat at all -- when it was at least 30 degrees outside and there wasn't, or at least there *shouldn't* have been, any kind of electricity in the house. Part of why I didn't say anything was because I knew that my only explanation; that of ghost activity, would've had Kev pointing the finger, laughing at me and well, I was trying to have fun with this. What I *did* do, though, was take out my GoPro and have it at the ready.

We sat our stuff down and Kev, Rod, and even Rachel began taking off their shirts. Somehow, despite feeling it just as much myself, I was the only one that wasn't as badly affected by the heat as they were. Determination, so I guessed. I started walking around with my camera held up. Now, despite what I said before, it was as I moved out of the living room and into the kitchen that the heat increased and I was then forced to take my shirt off, too.

"So much for "abandoned", huh?" Rod remarked.

"Well maybe we're on top of one of those underground hot springs or something." the three looked at me, raising their eyebrows. "Look, I don't know, man."

"Neither do I," Kev said, "but God, it gets any hotter in here and we might not *need* to douse the place in gas for it to catch fire." I went into the kitchen and began searching for the circuit box. It didn't make a *whole* lot of sense since there shouldn't have been electricity running through the place, but I figured it was at least worth giving a shot. If nothing else, it'd be a sign that someone still lived here (though how the hell they could keep the power on for all this time without ever leaving to go to work or anything -- plus how they could possibly stand the heat -- was far beyond my ability to try explaining). When I opened the panel, I found that all of the switches were off, and when I tried to flip them on, of course, nothing happened.

"Dude, what are you doing in there?" Rachel called from the living room.

"Checking the breakers."

"Why?"

"Well, I mean, this heat has to come from *somewhere*." I started checking around the kitchen area to see if maybe there was some sort of heating element turned on. Of course, everything was off. Of course, that's how it *should* be -- THERE WAS NO POWER!

*But where is this heat coming from?*

I snapped back to attention when I heard Rod call from the living room again, "Hey, come in here for a sec." I went back into the living room to find the three of them standing in the middle of the room, with Kev holding his flashlight on the floor, illuminating a large black symbol that was painted onto the floor. It was a weird symbol, with a bunch of intersecting arrows coming out of what looked like an infinity symbol.

"What the hell?" Rod says. Everyone else stood there, gawking at it while I, of course, immediately get to snapping.

"Dude, I think that's some sort of satanic symbol or something." I heard Kev say behind me. I felt a sly grin creep across my face. Admittedly, this actually made me a little excited at first, you know? Think about it; me and my friends found an *actual* satanic house. That'd be something for the memory books, right? Again, in a sick sort of way, wish granted.

After a minute, though, I noticed that the heat seemed to come from the symbol. Just standing *maybe* two to three feet away from it, I could feel waves of heat coming from it. Rachel noticed this as well, stooping down to hold her hands up a little closer to it. She recoiled when her hands were about three inches from one of the edges, inhaling sharply.

"Rachel, you okay?" Kev asked, eyes widened.

"Yeah, it's just hot." Rod looked at her confused.

"Huh?" he asked.

"I think the heat is coming from this." They looked down at the symbol again. Rachel looked up to me and said, "I don't think this's a good idea. Can we just--"

"Hey, uh... guys?" We looked to Rod. His eyes were wide, focused on the symbol on the ground. Our eyes followed to find that the symbol was now glowing. Immediately, I felt the floor beneath us start stinging the bottom of my feet. As well as this, the air in the room became dense.

When I looked at my arm, feeling something like a sunburn stinging across it out of nowhere, I noticed that there was a large bright reddish-pink spot forming across my forearm. Looking closer, I then noticed that the arm hairs were even beginning to singe away. "Guys, it's too hot in here," said Kev, walking over to the door. "I'm getting out of-- *Gaah!"* He retracted, clutching his wrist in pain.

"Dude, what happened?" I cried out.

"What does it look like, genius?" he retorted. "The fuckin' knob's burning." Our attention turned to the doorknob which, like the symbol on the floor, was indeed glowing like it was being heated from the other side.

"Try the window." Rachel said, growing more and more alarmed. He went over to the window and before he even touched the sill, he backed away and said it was too hot, too. My breath became heavier and heavier by the second. Rod, however, despite being barely two feet from the symbol, was the only one who didn't seem affected by this. In fact, he wasn't responsive at all to anything.

"Rod?" I called to him, somewhat pitifully, as difficult as it was to breathe. "Rod, come on dude, we need your help to... Rod?" I noticed his body start twitching ever so slightly. I started stumbling over to him when his body abruptly went still. The other two turned their attention to Rod now as well.

"Rod?" Rachel called.

"Hey Roddy-boy? You alright?" Kev asked. At this, his body started jerking again, far more violently this time. Along with this, I could hear him start muttering something under his breath. It was frantic, whatever it was, sounding like he was trying to shout under his breath. I couldn't actually make out anything he was saying, other than maybe something about "We have to get out!" and "The beast is after us! Get the dagger!"

"Rod, what's going on? Snap out of it man!" I went up and put my hand on his shoulder to shake him. As soon as I touched him though, he shot out his arms and tightly seized my shoulders, fixing me with a sheer look of terror etched into his face. His eyes were wide, spiderwebbed with large veins that almost seemed to glow like the symbol and doorknob were. His mouth dropped open and, in a voice that wasn't his at all, he screamed at me, "He's coming! He's coming, we have to get out of here! The beast is--"

His body seized up again before going back to rapidly jerking again. His fingers were locked tight around my shoulders. I struggled to wrestle free but it was no use. "Bro, get off me!" He didn't react at all to this, his eyes fixed to the ceiling and his mouth hanging open. Kev and Rachel rushed over and tried prying him off of me but his hands were glued to my shoulders. The burning feeling started spreading throughout my body as well, seeming to channel into me from his arms. Suddenly, I began to see wafts smoke coming off of his arms.

The burning intensiflied in my shoulders and the other two retracted away from him, clutching their wrists in pain. Rod seized up again suddenly and shouted, "Save us! God, please, we're sorry, please save us!" This time, the voice coming out of him sounded like it belonged to a dude almost twice as old as him -- he's 18, by the way. Just like the time before, this voice sounded like it was crying out for dear life. By now, of course, my heart and mind both are in a petrified stupor and so I'm unable to do anything except feebly continue struggling against him, wondering what the hell he's talking about and why and how the hell smoke was coming off of him like that.

Oddly enough, this question was sort of answered almost immediately when he spontaneously burst into flames. It wasn't even three seconds before his body was completely engulfed. The pain was excruciating when I felt the flames spread from his hands to me. Despite being on fire, his fingers were still anchored into me and no matter how much more vigorously I fought against him, I couldn't force him to let me go. I knew if he didn't let go of me soon, my ass was gonna be barbequed along with his. Out of last resort reflex, you know, a "survival instinct", I guess you could say, I did the only thing I knew to do to make him let go. I reared back my kneecap and thrusted it forward with all my strength straight to his nads.

Thankfully, this actually worked and I was sent reeling backwards, landing flat on my ass on the, now scorching hot, wood paneled floor. Yelping in pain, I sprang back up to my feet and threw off my shirt, which had now caught fire. Me, Rachel, and Kev could only stand around and watch as Rod burned alive in the middle of the room.

Well, sort of. Thing was, despite being covered head to toe in flames for a solid minute and a half, he wasn't actually burning up. His skin was still perfectly intact, though he still screamed as though he were being cooked alive. Then, a flash of light burst from him and the symbol on the floor and he was gone. The house abruptly went silent after that. Everything was still, calm, with the only sounds coming from mine and the other's heavy, panicked breathing.

"Wh-Where'd he go?" Rachel piped up. She and I started throwing our heads around the living room. Kev just stared in utter shock at the spot where Rod had been standing.

"What the fuck was *that?"* he cried, starting to hyperventilate. "We gotta get out of here!"

"We can't. What about Rod, what if he's--"

"Dude, he just got *cooked alive!* Or did you *not* just see what happened?"

"Yeah, but did you see him? He didn't burn, which means he might still be alive, we can't just leave him."

"The hell we can't. Look, he was cool and all to hang out with, but you saw what just happened. You want that to be us next? No thanks, I'm out." He picked up the gas can and unscrewed the cap before sloshing the gasoline across the floor and walls behind him.

"What're you doing?"

"What we should've done five minutes ago. I'm sending this fuckin' place back to Hell."

"Wait, don't. What if he's still--"

"Then I hope you like him extra well done because I can't do this place anymore." He continued dousing the room in the gasoline when I went over to take it from him.

"Enough!" I shouted. "We can't torch the place until we're sure Rod ain't here anymore."

"Fuck off." He barked back, pushing me off of him. I shoved him back, causing him to crash against the wall. "Oh you little shit stain!" he shouted, lunging at me, tackling me to the floor. He had me pinned to the floor, where he then proceeded to repeatedly punch me in the face. Whether because I was caught off guard or because he was just that much stronger than me, or *whatever*, I couldn't do anything except pathetically try guarding my face from being jackhammered while he rained down blow after blow mercilessly.

"That's enough!" Rachel shouted. Kev paid no attention, continuing to smash my face in. I could hear him growl as he did so, like an animal. His eyes were wide open, too, wild and his teeth were bared. In other words, this wasn't just two guys horsing around here, not to him. No, he meant to do me in right then and there.

In a voice that wasn't his, similar to the way I describe Rod from a minute ago, Kev shrieked, "You won't keep me from sending this place back to Hell! I'm a-gonna expell the demons from this house, even if it means a-killin' you!" He reared back his fist and was about to smash me with it again when a blow from Rachel to the back of his head with her overnight bag knocked him off from on top of me.

He fell onto his side as I sat up, panting. "You okay?" Rachel asked, tightly clutching her bag. I just frantically nodded. Our attention then refocused to Kev, who was twitching on his side. I could hear him also muttering something under his breath, and just like Rod, I couldn't tell what he was actually saying. "Kev?" Rachel called out, slowly starting to approach him. "Kev, what the hell's the matter with you?"

I shot out my hand to her. "Rache, don't." She ignored me and continued the rest of the way to him. Almost as soon as she reached him, his body jerked upward, with him screaming in that same unrecognized voice as before, "You've all been tempted by the demons! They got you and ya think they're a-gonna get me!" He let out a demented cackle before saying, "Well you ain't, you hear?! I got the Lord on my side, and by his power, your rotting carcasses will burn in the eternal lake of fire!"

He then devolved into a hysterical laughing fit. Rachel looked back to me. "What's happening to him?" she cried.

"I-I don't--"

Before I could finish, Kev jumped to his feet out of nowhere and grabbed Rachel by her arms. "I'll tell you what's a-goin' on, she-devil! The Lord is a-passin' his judgement. He's gonna bring his righteous sheep back while the rest of you burn for all eternity!" He ended this with another cackling fit. Rachel squirmed violently.

"Get off me, Kev!" she demanded. Kev didn't let go. He continued cackling until he, too, suddenly burst into flames. It actually took Kev a little longer to become fully enveloped by them than they did Rod, but all the same, he, too, was soon covered in them. I rushed over to try and rescue Rachel, but by the time I could reach her, it was too late. The flames devoured her as well and in seconds, a burst of glowing light came from them and they were gone.

The house went still once again. Everything was silent. I was alone.

"R-Rachel?" Nothing. I dropped down at the spot where they were standing and examined the floor. There wasn't any sort of trace of them left behind. Not even a black mark from the flames. "Rachel! Kev!"

I felt across the floor, noticing now that it wasn't blistering hot anymore. I looked over to the symbol. It was fading out of it's glow, reverting back to it's charred black color from before. "Rachel! Kev! Rod! Can you hear me?"

Dead silence. I started going around to the different rooms, calling out for them. I noticed now that all of the heat from earlier was gone now. The house was the way it should've been when we arrived; dead and decrepit. No heat, no sounds, no electricity, nothing.

*What the hell?* I looked again to the spot in the floor of the living room where the symbol was, seeing that it was gone now. Instead, I found three large black spots where the others had been standing. I stooped down to touch them, where I then reeled back in shock. As soon as I touched them, I could hear their voices, along with about four or five others, all scream at me.

I shot straight to my feet and pulled out my camera, snapping pics of the spots on the floor before they dissolved into thin air right in front of me. After that, I took up my stuff and ran like hell out of there. I sprinted back home and immediately ran into and locked myself inside of my bedroom.

That night, I didn't sleep at all and the next morning, Ma and Dad came home. They could tell something was up with me by the fact that I wouldn't say anything to them and that they didn't come home to find me wide awake, playing video games. Regardless, I wouldn't leave my room the rest of the weekend. When Monday morning came and it was time to go to school, I seriously considered trying to miss it -- and the next day, and the next. How could I go back without them? What was I gonna say to people when they asked?

See, while we were all obnoxious to the school, people *knew* us. They *noticed* us. Basically, they'd recognize when three of the four biggest misfits of the senior class were absent for days and days on end. *"Yeah, we decided to break into an abandoned house on the end of the street and it ate them or something. Wild night, you know?"*

That was the other problem, I didn't even know what the hell happened myself. I mean, one minute, me and my buds are standing around, having a great old time, the next, we're boiling up inside a house that shouldn't even have any heat, then two of my friends start wigging out after finding a satanic symbol on the floor, *and now they're fucking gone!*

But when I did go to school that day, I found another surprise. No one seemed to notice the other's absence. I don't just mean that nobody was asking questions, I mean I noticed that, at the beginning of third period English Lit. class, which Kev and Rod share with me, neither of their names were called. I knew this wasn't a simple gloss over either because this teacher always went through the roll call twice. We used to find this annoying, but here, I was kind of glad she did.

I raised my hand, "Excuse me, Ms. Ashburn, but what about Rod and Kev?" At first, her and the class all stared at me like I'd just asked if the moon was made of cheese.

"I'm sorry, who?" she asked. I could tell she wasn't joking either.

"R-Rod... Roderick Tramforth and Kevin Ortega?" She kept staring at me, confused. "Y-You know, th-the ones that flick all the hornets at you when your back's turned? The ones who're always laughing while you're teaching? The--" She held up her hand.

"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, and I'll have to ask that you stop disrupting my class with this."

"B-But..."

"Enough." She said this with a low, stern voice and an equally cold expression on her face to accompany it. I shrank back down at that. She wasn't lying, and neither were the other kids. No one noticed Kev, Rod, and Rachel's disappearance. No, worse yet, they didn't even *know* them anymore! I was the only one who even remembered they even existed.

It's been at least three weeks since this all happened. I've been trying to look up more on the house, but every time, the search comes up empty. The only thing I can find about it is that one little article clipping from before. Nothing about what caused the fire or about the family that was living there. This led me to trying to search the family itself, though all that got me was the name, the Wallcrofts, and that they were apparently prominent members of the church back in the 80s and 90s. There was nothing about them personally, outside of a single letter that one of them apparently left behind, reading:

**"God is good. Though we walk in the shadow of the valley of death, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. I will fear no evil.**  **I see the Lord's light. We will all be delivered from this darkness..."**

There were a few words after this, but those were the only ones I could actually read. Everything else was all but illegible, looking like the signature of a doctor's prescription. Or perhaps like it was written in a hurry. See, at first, I read that note and thought to myself, like I'm sure you probably did, "*Yeah, okay, just some pompous religious monologue, sort of like every tele-evangelist you see on Sunday mornings, right?"*

Here's the kicker, that note had a *date!* 11/14/1991. Which, by the way, was only 3 days before the article about the fire was printed. That would make this one note the only surviving piece of evidence of their existence. That made me realize something with me.

I am the only one that even remembers Kev, Rod, and Rachel. I think it has something to do with the fact that I took a picture of the black spots, their last mortal remains, before they vanished. Fortunately, even though I couldn't take a picture of it, I was able to remember what the symbol on the floor looked like and so I searched it up and found that it was the symbol of Leviathan.

For those few that don't know, Leviathan is the biblical beast that's said to lurk deep within the ocean, as well as the "Serpent of the abyss". Now, I still don't know why it's there in that house, or exactly what it has to do with what happened with the fire, but I think I have one guess as to what happened that night with my friends.

I think, judging from the way they were acting before they disappeared, that the symbol, that Leviathan, somehow reached out and took them, snatching them out of this world and out of existence entirely. I still don't understand how or why it keeps happening or how no one's said anything about it, but I've noticed for the past few weeks now, that that same old ass UPS truck keeps driving through every Friday night to that house, and no one ever comes out to get it...
