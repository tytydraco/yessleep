There was nothing special about the cafe. Tiny yellow espresso mugs with smiley faces on them. Delicious French onion soup and worse-than-mediocre bread to dip. An overhang outside with rusty tables and wobbly chairs, a perfect place to watch passersby suffering through one of the several brief downpours that seem to afflict Paris at random intervals during every April afternoon.

No, nothing special at all about the cafe. Nothing except her.

Hélène.

Her arms were speckled in tattoos that her face looked entirely too wholesome for. Her eyes, green, almost the same circumference as the espresso mug she sipped slowly from as she sat, cross-legged, on the wobbly chair outside. But she didn’t watch the people, and they weren’t caught in a downpour. She just sat, immersed in a novel — McEwan’s latest — and looked beautiful.

I don’t like to bother beautiful women in public. But this time, I simply had to.

“I haven’t read him in a while,” I say, stepping out of the cafe, holding an Americano in a to-go cup. I *am* American, after all, and though I’d been in Europe for a while, I’d never understood the appeal of paying my hard-inherited money for a mere tablespoon of ultra-coffee. “Is that one any good?”

Hélène glanced up skeptically, a bit annoyed, as if she’d already been approached by five other men walking out of that very cafe. But she must have liked what she saw, because her gaze softened and she said, “He’s brilliant.”

“Would you think me uncultured if I told you I liked *Atonement* better as a film?” I asked, pulling out the seat across from her.

Well, that was all it took. We were off to the races, Hélène and I. We talked about everything from *The Cement Garden*, his creepy, incestuous debut novel, to *Nutshell*, the wife-kills-husband drama told from the perspective of the unborn child inside her. And of course, she told me I was wrong, dead wrong, about *Atonement*. Say what you will about McEwan, but you’ll always have *something* to say.

Eventually, casually, I asked her where she worked. 

“You might think it’s weird,” she said, her accent light and airy.

“Weirder than *Nutshell*?” I laughed.

“That’s fair,” she sighed, then leaned forward. “I work down in the Catacombs. I guide tours. Keep things clean. Hang out with all my friends down there…” She said this last with a faux-spooky waggle of her fingers.

I raise my eyebrows in feigned surprise. “The Catacombs! Wow. I wouldn’t have guessed that.”

But in truth, I wouldn’t have had to guess, because I already knew. It was the whole reason I approached Hélène that day.

Like I said: I simply *had* to talk to her.

___

I should back up.

It might come as a surprise, given my affection for Brit Lit and my apartment near the *Place de la Bastille*, but I was born and bred in West Virginia. *West* West Virginia, in fact, the part of the state all the other West Virginians spit at through their remaining teeth. I didn’t like much about the place, as you can surely tell, but I did like Abaddon Acres: the family home.

Abaddon Acres began humbly, but it didn’t end up that way. Generation after generation of my forebears added their own unique flair. Spare rooms, additions, annexes piled on and on until the place resembled nothing so much as a sprawling spiderweb. And over time, we Abaddons grew rich. *Very* rich.

Abaddon men were buried in a massive mausoleum out back. The women were buried out in the woods. It was the mausoleum that all my pals from school found so fascinating, then disturbing, when they came to visit the Acres. As for me, I didn’t find it either. It was just another part of home.

Going inside was strictly forbidden to all except the Abaddon family patriarch: my father. Naturally, I did steal the keys and snoop around in there a few times, eventually deciding that the thrill wasn’t worth the risk: it truly was nothing but dusty old tombs. And, as childhood waned and the hormone-fueled sun of puberty rose in the east, I found other pursuits more worthy of exploration.

And so, through sun and snow, sun and snow, the mausoleum stood proudly, untouched.

But then my father died. Cirrhosis of the liver, a disease I — having begun drinking young and hard — was surely on my own path to. My mother was beside herself; Abaddon women are not what you’d call self-sufficient. She cleaned the same things every day, for hours at a time, whether they needed it or not. She did what she knew how to do. And she detested drink. Any liquor spotted in the house would instantly be dumped and earn its owner a vicious slap upside the head. This was a problem, because I found myself needing a drink more than ever those days. I was the new man of the house, after all.

The new Abaddon patriarch.

This, truth be told, is what brought me back within those musty mausoleum walls: I needed a place to stash my scotch. And mother would never — *could* never — go inside.

Still, better safe than sorry. I searched high and low for the best place to hide my bottles. Perhaps behind the stone eagle perched atop the tomb of great-great-uncle Josiah? 

No…wait. What’s this?

A loose brick in the floor. Another. Another. A whole section of floor practically falling apart. It hadn’t been like this before, had it? And beneath the brick, which I uprooted in a curious frenzy late one night in my seventeenth year…beneath the brick I found a trapdoor.

A spiral staircase. No railing. Steps made of old, rotten wood. The first one creaked pathetically. If I fell through…if I hurt myself, couldn’t get back up…nobody would ever look for me in here.

And yet. Down I went.

Halfway down, my flashlight flickered. How long had it been since these batteries had been changed? I knew *I’d* never done it. Stupid. I continued on.

When I reached the bottom — only a couple dozen steps later, though I took each one with great care — my light extinguished completely. I smacked it against my palm, which for some reason always feels like it should work, but never does. Nothing. Just perfect. And what was that?

A voice. Whispering, barely there.

My name.

A chill ran through me, and it had nothing to do with the temperature. In fact, it was downright warm in the chamber. Muggy. It did not feel like a room of death; it felt like a greenhouse, a room of eternal life.

In response to the voice, I wanted to say, “Who’s there?” My tone was intended to be commanding, intimidating. What I said instead, and far more meekly than I’d hoped, was, “I’m here.”

And a fire sprang to life from a torch on the wall.

I stepped backward in alarm and tripped over my own feet. My hands collided painfully with the gravelly stone floor. The room, now illuminated to me, was smaller than I’d expected. Far smaller than the mausoleum above. The spiral staircase, a single torch on the wall, and a tomb. A sarcophagus, carved lovingly with intricate detail. Rising to my feet, wiping my dirty, bleeding hands on my jeans, I stepped closer. What were these carvings? Children running, fear etched on their stone faces. A woman slitting a man’s throat. A man devouring an infant. The horrors ringed the entire sarcophagus, all with the artistry of a Renaissance fresco.

I ran my fingers across the carvings. Blood smeared against them; my hands were hurt worse than I’d realized. And the soft voice again, saying my name…coming from inside the tomb.

A man’s voice, deep and abiding. I looked at the name etched on the stone.

Adam Abaddon. Born, 1642.

The first of us.

In truth, I regret all that business with Hélène. She was a nice girl — well-read, sweet, and funny besides. And a demon in bed, if you must know. In another life, things might have worked out between us.

We spent practically all our time together, those weeks after the cafe. I’m normally a guy who needs my space, but I had a job to do. I had to move quickly. 

I chose my moment with care. It was a Saturday afternoon. One bedroom window in my apartment hung open, a curtain fluttering in the sunlit breeze. We lay there, Hélène and I, naked in the sheets, her arm draped over my chest. Just catching our breath.

“So, when are you gonna take me to meet your friends?” I asked.

“My friends?” Her cute accent almost drowned in the ambient noise wafting in from outside.

“Sure,” I said. “In the Catacombs?”

She paused for a moment. “Oh! Wait, you’ve never been down there before? I thought you had…”

“Nope. But I’m dying to go.”

“Really?” Hélène asked, propping up on her elbow and appraising me. “Well, now I’m dying to show you.”

I pulled her elbow out from under her playfully, then flipped myself back on top of her. Almost time for round two. But first…

“Not while it’s open, though. I can’t stand tourists.” I kissed down her lobe, her throat, her collarbone. “I want you to sneak me in,” I said conspiratorially.

She giggled and squirmed in my arms. “You’re *bad*…” 

Afterward, she said that maybe we shouldn’t sneak in. Why didn’t I just pop by during her next shift, and she could give me a private tour? She could get in trouble, after all. Maybe fired. 

I told her that they weren’t going to fire a model employee like her just for sneaking her boyfriend in, and that if they did I’d just have to steal her away to my family home in West Virginia where I’d take care of her every need and she could take care of the thirteen sturdy children she’d bear me. She was mostly interested in my use of the word boyfriend. Apparently that’s when it became official; I discovered this by her squeal of excitement. I thought it had already *been* official. Culture barrier, maybe.

Anyway, her objections died there. Three nights later, past midnight, she and I stole away from the Montparnasse pavilion and across an empty street. There she used her key card to gain our entrance. We passed the booth where they gave out headphones for audio tours, passed the security gates.

“Do you want to check my pockets?” I asked her as we walked underneath the detectors. “You can reach in as deep as you like.”

“Don’t be gross,” she said, but with a laugh. She was enjoying herself. I got the feeling she had never been the adventurous sort, and she seemed to be getting a genuine thrill from sneaking me around. I’m glad she was happy, in those final moments.

Before long we reached a staircase. Spiral concrete steps, railings painted white, leading down into the abyss. 

I peered into the darkness. “Lead the way,” I said, fingers tracing the vial in my pocket.

In his writings, Adam Abaddon imagined hell as “black.” No lakes of fire, rivers of sulphur, no devil distributing torments to the masses. Just oblivion. Nonexistence. Nothingness.

As far as I know, I was the first to find these writings. Four books, bound in rotted leather, buried with him. I ventured back into the mausoleum night after night to drink Johnnie Walker and read the great man’s words.

And every once in a while, I’d peer into his stone tomb, at the bones that once scaffolded his meat and skin through life. I’d gaze into those holes that used to be eyes and find myself entranced at the darkness — no, the blackness — within.

Some nights, I could almost swear he was looking back at me.

The books were ostensibly biographical, but Adam was a man of philosophy, of thought. His writings rivaled any of the greats. Some kids cut their teeth on Nietzsche, or *Crime and Punishment*, or (God forbid) David Foster Wallace. I had my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather. And his words sunk deep.

Two hundred years before Darwin, he surmised that we were mere *Animalia*, descended from the apes. He forced his wife — and later, his daughter — to wash her hands with a lye-based solvent of his own devising before preparing his food. He anticipated the development of flying machines, long-range communication devices, and a global economy.

He also worked out a way to rise from the dead.

You see, Adam Abaddon’s truest achievements were in the realm of the occult. When such themes first appeared in his writing, I thought it a foolish preoccupation of an otherwise brilliant mind. Newton himself squandered countless hours and brain cells on alchemy and superstition. 

That was before I came to a page cleverly titled REVIVAL OF SPIRITS. I almost skimmed past it, but then noticed the artwork on the page: this was a potion. Or a spell, if you like. It showed the user how to take a nearly empty container of liquor (the *nearly* was important) and make it full again. I glanced at the bottle of Johnnie by my side. Not quite empty, as luck or fate would have it. And it had been a long day; a revival of my spirits was just what the doctor ordered.

With a mixture of anticipation and embarrassment, I went off in search of ingredients. Vinegar. The blood of a raccoon or a mink (I found a raccoon first). Opium — special thanks to Mother’s doctor for never asking too many questions about her frequent Vicodin refills. And of course, the scotch lingering at the bottom of the bottle, of which at least “a full hundred drops” were required. It all took some time.

Just before sunrise, I poured in the vinegar, the blood of the poor beast still lying broken somewhere in the woods, and the five Vicodin I hoped Mother might not miss. I placed my hand over the bottleneck — the recipe was very specific, the flesh of my right hand must fully cover the opening of the container — and shook. I repeated a Latin phrase three times. It was then that I very nearly dropped the bottle, for it had become much heavier in my hands.

In shock, I peered inside. The bottle was full. I sniffed inside. Smelled like Johnnie to me. Tentatively (who knows where that raccoon had been?) I took a swig. Yep, Johnnie Walker Black — through and through. Good Lord.

*No,* I thought. *Good Adam.*

I’ve never paid for another drop.

Down and down we went, Hélène and I. 130 spiraling steps, a five-story building beneath the earth, in the dead of night. All to grant Adam’s final plea:

*O, carry mine bones nearer hell…*

Once more I fingered the vial in my pocket. The crushed, powdered bones of Adam Abaddon.

That part had been easy. 400-year-old skeletons are not made of stern stuff. Getting it through airport security had been more stressful: I was fully prepared to say the vial was full of drugs. Happily, they didn’t catch it — though they did spend a great deal of time frisking an elderly Mexican woman while I sailed through unmolested.

When we reached the bottom, Hélène led us through a pitch-black stone tunnel with the flashlight on her phone. I crouched as I walked; the ceiling was very near my head. I could reach out my arms and touch both sides at once. The ground was painfully uneven; the walk went on for some time. Not your mother’s tourist attraction, to be sure.

Finally, we reached an open chamber. Signs abounded, in English and in French, explaining the history of the Catacombs — how more than six million people came to a final resting place in these subterranean corridors — and begging visitors: PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE REMAINS.

If you’re curious: the good people of Paris began to realize their burial habits constituted a public health crisis right around the time old, rotted caskets started crashing through the cellar walls of homes built near centuries-old cemeteries. But, as fate would have it, they’d built all those homes by mining tunnels through the rock deep under the city. So, in the dead of night after night after night, city and church officials emptied the graveyards of Paris, stacking the rescued bones against the tunnel walls. Floor to ceiling, miles and miles. Six million souls.

A mass grave. Just what Adam had ordered.

Hélène showed me around the tunnels with public access. Bones intermingled along the walls, a stack of tibias might be cut through by a row of skulls. Someone’s leg and head might be a long way apart. The thought of it made me strangely sad.

Unity. That was Adam’s guiding philosophy. Unity of the family, of the nation, of the mind. Death was an affront to Adam because the unity of body and soul was torn asunder. And that’s where I came in.

After a while, as our conversation about the place started to ebb, I grabbed Hélène’s water bottle. I’d filled it just before we descended. “You know what would make this more fun?” I asked, pulling out the vial of pale powder.

“You’ve got to be kidding,” she said, watching me dump the stuff inside. I screwed the lid back on and shook the bottle with a grin on my face. 

“What’s the matter?” I asked teasingly. “Never gotten high in a room full of dead people before?” I pressed the bottle to my lips and pretended to drink. It had to hit her before it hit me. That was crucial. I handed her the bottle.

“You’re serious?” she asked. I nodded.

“It won’t last long,” I assured her. “C’mon. It’ll be fun!”

She shrugged, then chugged. More than I thought she’d drink. That was good.

“Aaahh,” she said, wiping her mouth. “That tastes horrible.”

“You’ll forget all about the taste soon,” I said. “Let’s sit down and wait for it.” We found a wall of femurs, the sturdiest bones, to rest upon. I ran my fingers over the damp stone floor.

“Give me a bit more,” I said, reaching for the bottle. “You drank more than I did.” And this time, I did drink, an act of faith to rival any taken by Moses or Peter.

Hélène and I laced our fingers together and waited. After a while, she spoke: “I feel weird.”

“You’re supposed to,” I said, looking over at her. She coughed. Blood began to trickle from her nose.

“Wh-what’s happening?” she managed, coughing more fiercely and spraying more blood from both her mouth and nose. She clutched her stomach, fingers clawing as if trying to dig something out. Then she started to crawl on her hands and knees, blood dripping. She vomited fiercely.

“It’ll be over soon,” I muttered. Then I began to mutter other words. Secret words, from the Book of Adam. And before long I felt the pain rise in my own midsection, the blood seep from my own nostrils. Hélène was twitching violently on the stone floor, her body contorted, mouth foaming. She was still by the time I began coughing. But it was all happening too fast; I was coughing too hard. I wouldn’t have time to finish the spell.

Something primal in my body jerked me to my hands and knees, just as Hélène had been. I gasped out the words as I expelled the lining of my stomach through my teeth. Blood splashed the bottom rows of femurs. My brain felt like it was blistering, popping, seeping. How could I have done this to sweet Hélène? This was agony beyond imagining.

And then it stopped. I don’t know if Adam had somehow taken that cup from me, or if the pain receptors in my brain had simply given out. All I know is that I had just enough strength to say the final words before I died.

All noise and movement ceased, and the tunnels were peaceful once more. Our bodies lay in crumpled heaps beside one another. The authorities would examine our stomachs, our vomit, and they would find a mixture of cyanide and ancient bones. A lover’s pact, surely. It would be hushed up, cleaned up, reopened quickly and efficiently. The public could not be told how the sacredness of this place had been violated.

And then the bones on the wall started to shake. Almost imperceptibly, but resolutely, as some ancient power rose up from the depths, from the hell I’d carried Adam’s bones nearer. There was a low rumble, and from underneath a wall of bones, Adam Abaddon’s body rose anew.

*Thou hast done well*, said a voice inside our head as we crawled out from the weight of the bones and stood, dusty femurs clattering at our naked feet. 

*Thank you, Adam,* I thought in reply.

We stretched our limbs, he for the first time in centuries. Silently, we removed the clothes from my old body, lying still in a gory puddle of its own sick. Silently we put them on, each motion a sacred act. Adam had been — and now, is once again — exactly my size.

We looked down at the bodies for a time. At Hélène, whose wide, still eyes stared emptily at a pile of bones. Both of us grateful for what her sacrifice had made possible. I hadn’t known what to expect, but to share a mind was easy. Natural, even. I reeled through the centuries, memories I’d never lived. 

A miracle.

Finally, Adam lifted our eyes and turned our head toward the exit.

*Let us depart*, he said, and together we began the climb upward into the starry Paris [night.](https://www.youtube.com/c/SergeantDarwin)
