I’m closer to fifty than I am to forty now. I have two kids, a mortgage, and a husband who leaves his coffee mug in the sink every morning even though the dishwasher is right there. My oldest son was just accepted into med school; my youngest is in high school and still lets me hug her in public. We live in a quiet suburban neighborhood where nothing interesting ever happens, and most days I’m grateful for that.

This is not the kind of life where you expect old television contracts to come back and haunt you.

Back in the mid and late 90s, I was a working actress and model. Not in a glamorous way. I wasn’t famous, not even close. But it was steady. Commercial work, print ads, catalogs, the occasional local spot. A few minor speaking roles on recognizable movies, sitcoms and shows—never leads, never recurring, but enough that casting directors didn’t look surprised when I walked into a room. I paid rent, kept my reel and union card updated.

Then things slowed down.

By late 98, calls had thinned. Pilot season came and went without much to show for it. A couple of agencies passed. A few auditions went well and then disappeared into nothing. It happens—anyone who works or has worked in the industry knows that. But that summer, it all seemed to happen at once.

I still made rent, but I remember having to do math in my head every time I went for groceries.

That’s when the show came up.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t look down on reality TV at the time. Most of us did. Among “real” actors—and yes, we used that word unironically—reality TV was considered beneath us. Something you did if you couldn’t act, or if you were willing to embarrass yourself for exposure, or as a very, *very* last resort. 

The pitch was simple: twelve women living together in a house, filmed constantly, competing in challenges about ambition and honesty. No scripts. No characters. Just us. This was the 90s—no smart phones to confiscate, no internet to miss, no magazines. We were only allowed clothes and toiletries. Producers wanted no distractions. They wanted us present. Focused.

The contract was thick. The NDA thicker. Initial here. Here. And here.

Twenty-six years.

When I asked why it was so long, one of the producers laughed and said, “Trust me. In that time, no one will care.”

Filming began in early 99, in a rented house outside LA. It looked great on camera. Too great. All pale wood and wide windows and stainless steel surfaces that reflected light back at you. Up close, though, the place smelled faintly of bleach and something older underneath. Like a butcher shop that had been cleaned badly.

There were twelve of us. Actresses, models, dancers. A few girls who had never worked professionally but were very pretty and very eager to break into the industry. We were polite at first. Competitive in small, harmless ways. Compliments sharpened into comparisons. Comparisons into resentments.

The first week was easy. Group challenges. Confessionals. Drinking encouraged. Sleep discouraged. The food was catered—balanced, portioned, forgettable. Salads that tasted like plastic. Chicken breasts without skin. Rice measured carefully into identical bowls.

By the second week, we were hungry all the time.

That’s when they introduced *reward dinners*.

They framed it as generosity. Morale. “You’ve been doing great work.” Steak one night. Roast chicken another. Rich, heavy food served hot on real plates. We hadn’t realized how hollow we’d become until then. They filmed us eating—tight shots of mouths, fingers, teeth. Someone joked that it felt intimate. Someone else said it felt obscene.

The private interviews started around the same time.

They weren’t challenges. They weren’t eliminations. Just “sessions.” Long, quiet talks in a windowless room with soft lighting. Questions about money. About our bodies. About what we’d already given up for this industry. About what we were afraid of losing next.

The first girl disappeared at the end of week three.

No announcement. No goodbye. Her bed was empty. Her suitcase gone. Her name never mentioned again.

We asked what happened. A producer told us she’d breached contract. That was all.

The next reward dinner was lamb.

It tasted strange. Iron-rich. Gamey. Someone joked that it tasted *human*. We laughed, because that was funny, because it couldn’t be true. I noticed something fibrous catch between my molars. I worked it loose with my tongue and swallowed.

I didn’t want to be the girl who made a face on camera.

The pantry started emptying faster after that. Protein became scarce. The reward dinners came more often now, always after someone left.

They stopped telling us what the meat was.

One night, I found a fingernail in the sink after dinner. Painted a pale pink I recognized. I stood there for a long time, staring at it, my stomach twisting in a way that had nothing to do with hunger. Eventually, I rinsed it down the drain.

During my next session, they asked if I’d noticed anything unusual about the meals.

I said no.

They asked if I understood where the food came from.

I said I understood the rules.

They asked if I was grateful.

I nodded.

Another girl quit during a session. She ran out of the room screaming, sobbing. Her cries echoed through the housel. None of us followed her.

That night, the meat was served shredded, slow-cooked, swimming in sauce. You couldn’t see what it had been before. I ate until my stomach hurt.

By the time there were six of us left, no one talked about food anymore. We ate what we were given. We didn’t look too closely. Hunger makes denial efficient.

By the final week, there were three of us.

They separated us completely. Filmed us alone. Fed us alone. Interviewed us alone.

They told me the other two were struggling. That one had begged to leave. That the other couldn’t finish her meals. They told me I seemed grounded. Practical. Someone who understood what was at stake.

The final session wasn’t framed as a challenge. Just a test of commitment.

They placed a covered dish in front of me and lifted the lid.

This time there was no pretending. It was unmistakable. A slab cut carelessly, skin still clinging along one edge. The smell was sweet and rotting and familiar in a way that made my throat close.

I gagged.

They told me it wouldn’t be filmed.  
They told me this was the last step.

I asked what would happen if I refused.

They didn’t raise their voices. They didn’t threaten me outright. One of them just tapped the contract on the table and said, almost gently, that walking away at this stage would be considered a breach. That breaches carried consequences. Financial ones, at first. Then… others.

Then they said, calmly, “If you stop now, you don’t win.”

I thought of my rent. My empty answering machine. The meals I’d already eaten. The things already inside me. I thought of how much worse it would be to leave and still belong to them.

I cut a piece. Chewed. Swallowed.

I ate until they told me to stop.

They congratulated me quietly.

There was no finale. No broadcast. No celebration. Just a check, a ride home, and an NDA that sealed my mouth for twenty-six years. They reminded me, politely, that violating it would not be treated as a misunderstanding.

The show was completed, but last thing I heard it was simply never released.

I quit acting and modeling afterwards. Went back to college, got a degree, a normal job. Met my husband, had kids.

I learned to cook in ways that hid texture. I avoided red meat for years without explaining why.

For a long time, I told myself I hadn’t known. That hunger and pressure and manipulation made it impossible to think clearly.

That isn’t true.

I knew by the third meal. I knew by the fingernail. I knew by the way they watched us eat—quiet, attentive, like they were taking notes. There was a hunger in that room that didn’t belong to any of us.

I went through with it anyway.

Not because I was forced.  
Not because I was tricked.

Because I wanted to win.

The NDA expired last night. No one called. No one threatened me.

Because the people who made that show already got what they wanted..

And I was the only one willing to finish the meal.
