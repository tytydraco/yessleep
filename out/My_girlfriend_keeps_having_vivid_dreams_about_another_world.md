Meeting my girlfriend was one of the scariest experiences of my life. But it was also something that I’ll hold as a core memory. During my freshman year, I had incredibly bad asthma, mostly with extremely stressful situations. Not to mention it was paired with a little healthy dose of anxiety. Granted, I definitely could have had it worse, but it didn’t exactly make my life easy. 

I can’t remember why I was anxious that day. Maybe it was because of a test, or maybe because I got self conscious about my outfit or something stupid like that. All I know is that I was having the hardest time breathing, and I couldn’t find that stupid inhaler anywhere. And the more I panicked over the fact that I couldn’t breathe, the harder it became to breathe. 

I found myself having a panic attack in the middle of the hallway. Everyone one was yelling and shoving their way through the school, amplifying my emotions tenfold. Everything was blurry, one side of the hall felt like it was in slow motion and the other was felt like it was speeding by. I was so overstimulated, I actually considered if this was what dying felt like. But I was snapped out of my hurricane by a comforting hand tapping my shoulder. 

“Hey, I think you dropped this.”

I don’t think o ever saw a girl that gorgeous before in my life. She had wavy brown hair and bright blue eyes, I was mesmerized. Not to mention she seemed an inch or two taller than me. She held that tiny red piece of plastic in her hands, but to me, it might as well have been like looking at gold. What a relief to breathe properly, it was like being brought out from the bottom of the ocean, and I thank God she was there to help me. I had no idea what to say, I was a fourteen year old who had little experience talking to girls, especially ones who were nice to me. 

“Thanks, you’re a life saver.”

“No problem, it looked like you needed it. I’m  Nicole, but everyone just calls me Nikki.”

I found out she had a few classes with me, and I looked forward to every day I got to see her, not to mention I changed up my style to really get her to notice me. I started to comb my hair more, made a habit to stand up straight, even stole some of my dad’s cologne to make an extra good impression. None of it really worked, not I until actually started being myself and not just what I thought she would like. 

It wasn’t until the following year where I hit a growth spurt, and after being friends for a while I somehow gained enough confidence to ask her out. She responded pretty quickly, asking what took me so long. 

Fast forward three years, now we’re seniors and the relationship is still going strong. I wanted to say “I love you” from week one but I also didn’t want to sound too needy. Eventually, I said it but completely on accident. She looked at me with the most serious blue eyes and told me how she thought I was cute since the day she picked up my inhaler. I honestly never forgot that day, and it felt so surreal yet that she didn’t either. 

These past few weeks have been very weird, though. Things have been fine between us, but she’s been less than her cheery self I first knew. At first, she said she was fine, and I believed her. I didn’t feel it was right to push her to open up about something she wasn’t comfortable with. But as time went on I could see something was bothering her. I eventually got her to crack, and she just mentioned a weird reoccurring dream she’s been having, once or twice every week or so. 

Initially I was relieved, a dream couldn’t be that bad. After all, it’s just a bunch of stuff the brain makes up. So naturally, I just tuned it out. What else could I do? But then she kept bringing it up, and it really seemed to be bothering her. One day after school, she stopped at my house just to unwind from the day. She was sitting near my computer desk and I was sitting on my bed playing video games. I’m pretty good at dividing my attention, so this kind of thing never really brought up any problems. I was just getting close to the end of the level when she tried to bring up the dream again, and how she felt it was really freaky. I honestly had no idea how to respond, so I made a joke about how maybe she’s psychic and seeing visions into the future. 

“Sam, can you just be serious for once? Can you do that for me? Just for one second, no jokes, no sarcasm, none of that crap. Can you just take me seriously?”

Not wanting to enrage my girlfriend any more, I paused my game and shifted my whole body toward her to show her she had my full attention. 

“Ok, ok I’m sorry, really. I’m being a douche about something that’s really bothering you, so let’s talk about it. I’m all ears.”

“Thank you. I didn’t mean to raise my voice, I just…”

I stopped her, and moved a few inches closer. 

“Just start from beginning.”

“Ok. Well, I don’t exactly know when it started but I keep coming back to this weird Other World. I start walking and I find myself in this ruined city that seems to stretch on forever. And there are these thick, twisted trees, bare of any leaves just stretching up towards the sky, past the clouds. Oh, and the sky- it’s just a constant red, like crimson. I just walk for what feels like forever.”

“Woah, that does sound pretty freaky. Do you see anyone in these dreams, like anyone you know?”

“Now that you mention it, yeah. Nobody I know, I don’t think. But there are these dark figures that kind of look human but they’re…off. Like their face is too long, or their body is wide but very bony, or they have a smile that belongs in the uncanny valley. And they…they keep whispering things as I’m walking. I can’t make it out ‘cause they’re all talking at the same time. I don’t of it’s to each other or me, but they’re all definitely watching me. It’s like a million eyes on me with every step. I keep walking until I see this large stone wall in the distance. I can hear it whispering too. Then, I wake up.”

The way she vividly remembers it was very unsettling. Every detail like that, committed to memory can’t be normal. But I can’t jump inside of her head, so I use some sort of reasoning to help ease her.
“Maybe it has something to do with stress or expectations, I don’t know.”

“What do you mean you ‘don’t know’?”

“I mean it’s a dream, Nic. I’m not an expert analyst. What am I supposed to say?”

“Maybe, ‘It’s ok hon, I know this is scaring you, but we can figure this out together.’ Y’know, something supportive?”

“I’m trying to be supportive, but I can’t help what I can’t understand.”

“Whatever, forget it. I shouldn’t have even said anything.”

“Oh, c’mon. Don’t be like that.”

“It’s not- ugh, I’m sorry. It’s not your fault, and it’s not fair to take it out on you. It’s just this stupid dream keeps happening and it’s really stressing me out and I don’t know why and-“

She stood up from the chair and plopped on to my bed, groaning into my pillow out of frustration. To comfort her, I put my hand on her head and gently stroked her brown hair. I was about to tell her it would be alright and we’d get through this, but I was halted by a buzzing sensation spreading across my bed. Nikki lifted her face, pulling out her phone to tap the screen and put it to her ear. 

“Hello? Hey, yeah I’m just with-ok, yes. Yes, I’m on my way now. Ok, see you in a bit, bye.”

She ended the call and looked at me while rolling her eyes. 

“That was my mom, she needs me home. I’ll call you later?”

“Yeah, sure. No problem.”

Nikki grabbed her bag and headed downstairs towards the door, giving a friendly wave to my parents. I felt awful for her. Whatever this dream was, it was really messing up her head. And if it’s messing her up, it’s messing me up by default. I try to be an empathetic person, and I think I do a good job, but if something genuinely doesn’t make sense to me, it’s hard to feel that way. Especially if it doesn’t directly affect me. Maybe that’s just me, maybe I’m just crazy. But I do love Nikki, truly I do. So I’m going to figure out what this means, no matter how long it takes. She’s worth it. 

I went online and searched every dream analysis web page I could find. No way we can afford a psychiatrist, so this’ll have to do. All these different meanings just don’t add up with Nikki’s life. According to some, her being in another world is apparently supposed to represent losing touch of reality or control, but she’s one of the most focused people I know, always thorough with everything. Not to mention she’s getting a full ride to a college she chose. As for people whispering and watching her, from what I’ve read, that’s supposed to reflect a personal impulsive behavior, or fear of being judged. The thing is, Nikki is one of the most liked people in the whole school, literally. She’s nowhere near popular, but she’s always kind, never talks behind anyone’s back (even if they deserve it), and always brightens up the day. Most of all, she just doesn’t care if someone doesn’t like her. She has no enemies, nobody to even bat an eye against her sweet nature. So why would she have a deep fear of being judged? With no luck, I decided to try searching up the place to see if maybe it’s something she saw in real life, and was just stored in her brain. But nonetheless, it was like it didn’t exist. After about almost two hours, I gave up and knocked out on the edge of my bed. 

Around an hour later, I was woken up from my sleep by something that sounded like whispers through my window. Looking out of my window I see the line of street lamps, their lights flickering with an intensity I’ve never seen before. Before I can dismiss it, I see something shaking in the bushes in my backyard. I assume it’s a wild animal, probably a cat or a raccoon, but I’m not one to go investigating that easily so I dismiss it. As soon as I turn my back to try and fall back to sleep, I hear the whisper again. Then it sounds like two. Then three, and then six, ten, maybe twenty. I can’t make out what they’re saying but they’re all…talking at the same time. Just like Nikki’s dream. But it can’t be real, right? 

At least that’s what I was thinking until I turned back around to see something fall face first out of the bush. It lay on the ground dormant for a second, until it swerves its head up to reveal bright pink eyes. It then began to drag itself across the lawn and onto the side of the house, grabbing the bottom of the gutter.  My room is on the second story so it’s not easy feat, but this figure makes it seem like nothing. It slithers its way up, and I can see its arm stretching towards my window, each of its fingers sharpening into thin but long claws. My window is met with a slow screeching, the claws sliding down the pane. The sound was unbearable, I closed my eyes and covered my ears. I began to back away from the window, I couldn’t take this torture, until my heel meets my bag and it trips me. Sitting up, I try to recover from the collision of the back of head and my carpet, but now everything’s gone quiet. No more voices, and that monstrous creature is nowhere to be seen. I rush to my bathroom to splash the coldest water possible in my face to make sure I wasn’t dreaming myself. Maybe the way Nikki described her dream to me somehow made its way into my subconscious and now I was imagining something similar. I stood at my sink for 20 minutes, trying to “wake myself up”, but I still just felt as awake as ever. I laid back in bed trying to convince myself I just had some weird hallucination from fatigue or something, until I drifted back off to sleep. 

The next morning I threw on my flannel and black converse, and got ready to make the walk to school. But as I reached for my bag on the floor, something on the window managed to catch my attention. There it was, clear as day. It was the scratches the creature made on my window, still looking fresh as ever.
