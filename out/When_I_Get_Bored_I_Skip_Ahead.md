I skipped my entire shift today.

I came to as I stepped off the subway.

My head was a bit foggy and I vaguely remembered the day.

Hours of driving strangers around the city. Glimpses of lives far more interesting than my own.

Normally I didn't skip entire shifts, but I wasn't in the mood today.

I discovered this ability when I was a teenager.

One particularly tiresome day of school, I wished I could just skip to the part where I got to go home.

Then, I did. I blinked and I was on the bus, on my way home.

I've honed and perfected it in the years since that moment.

Now, I'm never bored.

Awkward client.

Skip.

DMV wait.

Skip.

Wife wants me to spend quality time with the kids.

Skip.

I didn't ask for these obligations. I just want to relax and enjoy myself.

When i’m skipping, my body apparently just acts normal. It does whatever I would normally do in any given situation.

Like running on auto pilot.

So it doesn't really matter if I skip every time I'm alone with the kids.

They're still getting the “proper bonding time” my wife won't shut up about.

When I made it to the apartment building, I found an “Out of Order” sign on the elevator.

I headed to the stairs. I shoved the door open and in a blink, I was at my floor.

In another blink, I was at my door.

I was especially lazy today.

I unlocked the door and was treated to the smell of cooking bacon.

“God,” I mumbled as the door clicked shut behind me. “I'm starving.”

“Welcome home,” my wife said. She stood at the oven, picking through strips of bacon on a pan. She was still wearing her uniform.

My wife was a police officer.

I dodged around my youngest son on his high chair and joined my wife in the kitchen.

She had a plate of freshly cooked bacon on the counter.

“Marlon has been excited to see you,” my wife said. “Wants to show you something.”

“Sure,” I said, plucking a strip of bacon from the plate. “Marlon! Where you hiding at?”

A boy sauntered out from the hallway. He jumped onto the couch and sat with a pout.

I walked out into the living room, chewing on my bacon.

“What do you want to show me?” I asked.

Marlon watched me closely. He had that look on his face that always got on my nerves.

I couldn't tell you why we named him Marlon.

My wife was in labor for thirty hours. I ended up skipping about halfway through.

And when I came back, my son was named Marlon.

“Marlon,” I said. “What is it?”

His face didn't change. The boy looked like a dumb pug, too busy struggling to breathe to think properly.

Forget it.

Skip.

Five minutes.

Just enough to resolve whatever that was.

What was I supposed to say?

Maybe my autopilot figured something out. Marlon was smiling when I turned away from him.

We gathered at the table, sharing the plate of bacon.

“Is this all we're eating?” I asked.

“Yup,” my wife said. “Bacon day. Come on, we do this every month.”

I laughed.

“Yeah, I remember.”

I always forgot bacon day. What a weird habit.

I wasn't as obsessed with bacon as my wife clearly was.

Skip.

I blinked at a dark ceiling.

My wife clung to me, our naked bodies brushing together.

What? We were in bed?

My wife peeled away, groaning and popping her back.

“Will you turn the kitchen light off?” She asked through a yawn.

“Uh. Sure.”

I put on some underwear and walked out into the dark apartment.

The only light was the faint glow from the kitchen.

I hadn't meant to skip the entire evening, just dinner.

Whatever.

I flicked out the kitchen light and shivered.

The thermostat was set way too low. I adjusted it before heading back to bed.

I skipped without thinking about it. Just twenty seconds to get me to bed.

But I came to in my taxi.

I jerked forward, leaning on the horn.

“Calm down, man,” a woman said in the back.

I straightened in my seat, watching traffic grind slowly on.

“What?”

“Calm down,” the woman said again. “We'll get there when we get there, geez.”

I had to actively stop myself from skipping this woman out of my cab.

Something was wrong.

How much time had I lost?

This wasn't the first time I'd overshot. When I first learned I could do this, I would sometimes skip hours when I meant to skip minutes.

But this was potentially half a day.

“Hey, you missed my turn!” The woman shouted, beating against the barrier between the front seats.

Skip.

It was a reflex.

I came to as I got out of my cab. My shift was over.

On my phone, I found out that I'd lost a month.

I'd never skipped more than three days. And that was because my wife was furious and wanted a divorce.

Somehow in those three days, I'd convinced her to change her mind.

A coworker had parked next to me. An older woman with thinning gray hair.

“You've been pulling this week, huh?” She said.

“Sure.”

I quickly left.

The subway was slower than I preferred. Something came up and they had to stop for an hour.

My knee bounced and I checked my phone three times.

No texts or missed calls.

My ability was growing more powerful. That was all.

I needed to be more specific with my skips.

I considered doing it. Trying out a couple minutes to test it.

But I hadn't even been home yet.

What if something had changed in the month I'd missed.

I only had vague memories of that time. Faint laughter and balloons.

Oh. Wasn't Marlon's birthday coming up?

How old was he now?

My knee bounced faster.

Everything was fine.

My wife and my boys were at home. They were waiting for me.

Two minutes.

Skip.

I didn't skip two minutes.

I was standing on my apartment floor. My back was against our door, facing the hallway.

Behind me, faint sobs, broken only by coughing.

I slowly lowered my head, finding a bruised knuckle.

I flexed my fingers, my knuckle aching.

What?

I pulled away from the door, legs unsteady beneath me.

A wail came from the other side.

No.

No.

No.

I whirled around, grabbing the doorknob and twisting. Locked.

A scream tore from the other side, shrill as it ripped through my head.

“Go away!” Someone begged. “Get the fuck away from me!”

“Wait…” my own voice was stiff.

Who was that?

My wife?

My knuckle ached.

“I'll shoot you if you come in here, you hear me!”

“Listen to me!” I shouted back, trying the knob again.

But what could I say? What should I say? What had I done?

I hadn't done anything wrong.

I had to explain. Whatever happened in that apartment, it hadn't been me.

I'd avoided explaining by ability to anyone for so long but now was the time.

She had to understand.

Footsteps. I hardly noticed them when hands rained down on me.

I was taken to the floor in a heartbeat.

Three people. Two women and a man. I didn't catch their faces. I only caught their fists.

Blow after blow.

“Get him up!” A blonde woman ordered. “Come on!”

Two pairs of arms dragged me to my feet, I dangled limp in their grasp.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” Blonde spat. “Cassie is the one good thing you got. And you think you're gonna get off with beating up on her?”

The hallway fell quiet. The only noise was the sobbing beyond my door.

Tears welled in my eyes. Everything hurt.

A blow landed on my back. The man grunted, holding me still.

I arched back, mouth gaping. I couldn't even make a noise.

These people. Fellow cops? Had my wife called them? Why?

I'd hurt her.

No.

The autopilot was supposed to do what I would normally do.

I wouldn't hurt her.

What happened?

I couldn't remember.

Damn it.

What day was it? 

“Say something!” Blonde yelled. “Don't you give a shit about the baby?”

Baby?

Oh, my other son.

What was his name?

“Hasna,” Blonde barked. “Check on Cassie.”

The other women—Hasna—let go of me and moved to the door.

“That's my wife!” I blurted.

“Now you wanna talk?” Blonde cocked an arm.

I had a second to flinch before her fist crashed into my nose.

Something cracked.

I screamed and staggered back, falling free of the man's grasp and landing on the floor.

My nose didn't feel right. I tasted blood. I clasped at my nose with trembling hands.

“Cassie, it's Hasna, can I come in?” Hasna knocked gently at my apartment door.

The only response was more crying.

I tried to get up but my head was swimming.

“Come on,” Blonde said, walking up to me.

The man followed. Both of them loomed over me.

“What's going on out here?” A man popped out an apartment down the hall. “I'm calling the police!”

“We are the police,” Blonde said, flashing a badge at him. “Get back in your apartment.”

 My apartment door opened. I glimpsed the inside before the man stepped forward, blocking my view. 

I saw her for a fraction of a second. My wife. Cassie. 

Her face was bloodied. Her mouth hung open and her eyes were squeezed shut. 

Every part of my body sank. All of my strength sapped into the floor. 

I couldn't have done that. It wasn't me. 

I almost did it, right then. I almost skipped. 

But that was what caused this. I caused this. 

“Jesus Christ,” Blonde knelt before me. Her eyes were puffy and her face was flushed. “God help me I should put a bullet in your head right now. 

I couldn't stay here. 

The autopilot always did what I would do. 

I thought of Marlon's smiling face what had felt like an hour ago. 

I couldn't have done that. I hardly knew how to talk to that kid. 

Something went wrong, but it would fix it. 

It would make it right. 

Blonde grabbed me by the collar and gritted her teeth in my face. 

Skip. 

I opened my eyes to light. My head throbbed and my back ached. I learned forward in a metal chair, finding my hands bound to the table in front of me. 

I winced and took in the barren room. 

A door opened and a woman in gray stepped in. She was holding files. 

“What day is it?” I asked, looking up at her. 

The woman said nothing. She sat across from me, expression flat. 

“Answer my questions first,” she said, slapping the files down. 

I nodded stiffly, my knee starting to bounce. 

I was arrested. For hurting my wife? Should I try to explain my ability to this woman? 

It wouldn't matter. All she'd see was an abusive husband. 

I balled my fists. As I did, I lowered my eyes and found scratches all over my arms. 

I stared at them. 

“You can request a lawyer if you'd like,” the gray woman said. “It's within your rights.”

“I haven't done anything wrong,” I said carefully. “Where is my wife?”

Her eyes tightened. Her mouth became a flat line. 

“I'm going to ignore that,” she said. “On the morning of your wife's death, where were you?”

I stammered. 

“You aren't going to answer?” She flipped through her files. “I have surveillance of you arriving at the building an hour before the murder.”

I didn't speak. I couldn't wrap my head around what she was saying. 

My wife had been alive. 

There were cops. 

“Did you abuse your wife?” Gray held out a picture. It was my wife. Her face was bloodied. 

I averted my eyes, chest starting to heave. 

“If you want a lawyer, just say the word,” Gray said. “You were a lot more talkative this morning.”

What had I said? 

My eyes returned to the scratches on my arm. 

“Three cops reportedly arrived at your residency and found Cassie Mayer beaten to a pulp. Xray revealed a cracked skull.” Gray slid the paper across the table, closer to me. 

“I didn't do it,” I mumbled. “It wasn't me.”

“Who was it?” Gray asked. “Don't tell me she fell down the stairs.”

I looked her in the eye, summoning all of the steel I could muster. 

“I have the ability to jump through time,” I said. “I can skip parts of my life.”

Gray cocked an eyebrow. 

“Mr. Mayes,” she said. “Your wife is dead.”

No. 

She wasn't. 

She couldn't be. 

I didn't kill her. 

“I've been skipping too much,” I blubbered, tears wetting my cheeks. “I skipped and I found her like that. It was the other me. I wasn't there when it happened.” It all spilled out, jumbled and frantic. 

“You know what?” Gray slapped her files. “You're a time traveler, huh? What's it like? How's it feel to skip over your life?”

“It was nice,” I said. “But I—”

“Jesus.” She shook her head and got up. “I hope you understand just how screwed you are.” She gathered her files but left the picture of my wife on the table.

Then, she was gone. 

I couldn't look at it. She wasn't dead. 

I skipped it. Why had I skipped so much? 

I tried to remember. To focus on the lost time. 

Screams. 

My son facedown on the floor. 

My wife standing between me and him, shouting at me. 

The plate in my hand. The sound of it shattering against her head. 

Blood. 

Why didn't I stop hitting her? 

I felt strangely numb, then. When I understood it all. 

I'd lashed out at her. Beaten her. Twice. But one time she didn't survive. 

This numbness was familiar. The same numbness I felt when I first discovered this ability. 

A boy sitting in the back of class, too bored to pay attention. Moments away from learning his magical potential. 

Is that what it was? Magic? 

What if it wasn't real? 

What if instead of skipping, all I'd been doing was closing my eyes? 

Whatever. 

I knew, somehow, that I would be okay. 

It didn't matter. 

I didn't have to stay here. 

I would skip and keep skipping. 

Until I couldn't anymore. 

Skip.
