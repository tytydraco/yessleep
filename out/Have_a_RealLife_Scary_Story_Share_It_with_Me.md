Hi everyone,

I’m looking for real-life scary encounters, creepy experiences, and paranormal stories to feature on my YouTube channel, WRONG TUNNEL—a place dedicated to horror storytelling and chilling tales.

Whether it’s an unexplainable experience, a brush with the supernatural, or a terrifying event that still haunts you, I want to hear your story! I’m passionate about bringing spooky and unsettling stories to life through narration, and I’d love to share your encounter with my audience.

How to Submit Your Story

If you have a story you’d like to share, just send me a DM with the following details:
1.	Your Name (or let me know if you’d prefer to remain anonymous).
2.	When the Event Happened (approximate timeframes like “a few years ago” or “last summer” are fine if you’re unsure of exact dates).
Once I receive your DM, I’ll share my email address with you so you can send the full story there. Don’t worry if you’re not a writer—I can edit and clean up the text if needed while keeping your story intact and respectful to your experience.

What You’ll Get in Return

I’ll give you full credit for your story (if you’re comfortable with that) and mention your name or preferred alias in the video. If you’d rather stay anonymous, that’s completely fine too—I’ll respect your privacy.

The goal is to honor your experience and make sure it’s told in a way that captivates listeners while staying true to the details you share.

What Kind of Stories Am I Looking For?

I’m open to any scary, mysterious, or unsettling stories, including:
•	Paranormal Encounters – Ghosts, spirits, haunted places, or unexplained occurrences.
•	Creepy Strangers – Encounters with unsettling or dangerous people.
•	Urban Legends and Folklore – Experiences tied to local myths or strange happenings.
•	Unexplained Disappearances or Time Gaps – Moments where reality just didn’t make sense.
•	Deep Web or Dark Web Horror Stories – Strange interactions or unsettling discoveries online.
•	True Crime-Inspired Events – Real encounters involving danger or suspense.
•	Anything That Gave You Chills – If it scared you, I want to hear it!

Why Share Your Story?

Sometimes, it helps to get these experiences off your chest, especially if they’ve lingered in your mind or left you with questions. Sharing your story can help others who may have gone through something similar feel less alone—or just give people a good scare!

I take my time with each story to make sure it’s treated with the care and attention it deserves. My channel is all about delivering spine-chilling content in a respectful and engaging way, so if you’re ready to share your experience, I’d love to help bring it to life.

Let’s Connect!

If you’re interested, just DM me here on Reddit with your name (or let me know if you prefer to stay anonymous) and the approximate time your story happened. I’ll follow up with my email address so you can send the full details.

I’m excited to hear your stories and can’t wait to feature them in upcoming videos on my channel!

Thanks so much,

YouTube Channel: WRONG TUNNEL
