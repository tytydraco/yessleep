Before I update with the insanity the past few days have been, and in case you haven’t seen my other posts, here’s the short version:

\- My coffee table duplicated.

\- The Vermont house grew a shoe in the wall.

\- I found a manual with weird instructions stitched into my tool bag.

\- I followed those instructions in a Maine house, and the outside view turned from a coastline to a desert. 

If you don’t know what’s going on, neither do I. That’s why I’m asking for help.

I’m sat in my van at a rest stop near the Maine border. The engine idled to keep the heater running against the coastal chill, my V-Net laptop sat open on the passenger seat, logged into the employee directory. 

I typed in the three ID numbers I found on the back of the manual.

Each search returned a single line of grey text. 

Status: Active

Location: Zero Point.

I tried to click the location to see if a map popped up, but instead a web page appeared stating ‘Permission Denied. Access Logged’. 

I shut the laptop immediately.

Access logged?

*Logged where? By who?*

I assumed this meant someone knew I was looking, and I didn’t feel good about that.

I tried to leave the duplicate table behind in Vermont. I hauled it out of the van and left it by a dumpster behind a gas station. I watched it sit there in the rain for a few minutes before driving away.

When I opened the van at the rest stop, it was back. 

It was sitting right next to the original table, the two identical bilateral stains staring at me like a pair of dark eyes. Mocking me. 

So I have two of them now, and I can’t seem to get rid of them. 

I searched online for ‘Zero Point’ and found nothing useful. Some references to do with a game, and a wiki page with various meanings, but no location details. 

So I tried phrases like ‘duplicating furniture’, ‘item stuck in wall’, ‘losing blocks of time’, and that’s how I found the forum.

I made a throwaway and wrote my own post, keeping it vague, but mentioned the missing time, duplicated table, and the location I’d seen in the directory.

Ten minutes later, my phone vibrated. I had a direct message from a user, who I’ll call ‘A’. The message was short and said:

*’if you want to know what happened to the others, meet me here at 6am tomorrow. look for a blue sedan. it’s a dead zone, it’s safe.’*

They provided coordinates. 

I wasn’t too keen on meeting some random internet stranger, so I didn’t message back.

I got back onto the highway and headed North. 

When another vision hit me. 

A sudden and total shift in my perception. I was standing in a garden in Georgia. Humidity clung to my skin and cicadas buzzed in the trees. I was wearing a lavender silk dress, and the fabric itched against my ribs. I held a bouquet of hydrangeas and watched a couple exchange vows under an oak tree. 

I have never been a bridesmaid, and I have never been to Georgia. I grew up in England, and moved here when my parents came over for work. 

But I remember the exact way the sunlight caught the champagne glass in my hand. I remember the bride’s name.

Clara. My sister.

*I do not have a sister.* 

The memory was so vivid, that I drifted onto the rumble strip. I snapped back to reality and swerved back onto the road, forcing myself to focus, and telling myself it must have been a scene from a movie I can’t remember watching. 

But the thing is, I know someone who lived in Georgia, who had a sister called Clara. 

Rita. 

Same training batch as me, Madey and Donna. She was based out of Atlanta for a while, and used to talk about her sister all the time. Before Clara died last year. Car accident on the way home, Rita said. 

*I don’t understand what’s going on.* 

I pulled over at the next gas station to splash cold water on my face, I thought I was seriously losing it. 

That’s when I felt a stinging sensation on my right knee. 

I rolled up my trouser leg and saw a thin, jagged white scar sat on my kneecap, about two inches long. 

*I have never had a fucking scar on my knee!*

I touched it, and it felt old. It also felt familiar. 

Then it hit me. The woman in the garden fell on gravel when she was 8. That’s where the scar came from. 

*How the fuck did I know that?*

I went back to the van. A pressure building behind my eyes, and I struggled to think clearly. My mind felt… crowded. Like I was fighting to be heard in a noisy room. 

For a second, I heard myself reciting the Kit48 checklist in a Southern accent.

For a second, I heard myself crying in a bathroom I have no memory of ever being in. 

*What is going on?*

I got in my van 3 hours ago, but it feels like I’ve only been sat here 5 minutes. I haven’t moved. I’m worried I’m losing longer periods of time, and I’m scared. 

I’ve decided I’m going to go and meet A, because something I can’t explain is going on, and I need answers. 



**(Update)**



I met her.

I pulled into the diner parking lot at 5:55am. The sun was still sat behind the pines and the cold cut straight through my work jacket. The diner was a small, squat building with a neon sign that hummed with a high, irritating frequency. 

Inside smelled like old grease and floor cleaner, but It felt solid. It felt real in a way that the houses I stage do not. 

I found her in the furthest booth. 

She was pale, with bloodshot eyes, and hands that shook so badly that the coffee in her mug had a continuous ripple. I sat down across from her and asked who she was. 

She said I didn’t need to know.

She explained she'd worked in data entry at the regional office for 3 years, ‘putting numbers in spreadsheets’. She looked normal enough, but her hair was slightly ruffled, and she had faint black smudges under her eyes.

She told me that the budget for the staging kits is a joke, and the company skimps on everything we see.

That, I knew already.

"The real money,” she said, her eyes darting to the door and back, “the billions the banks pour in, goes to the Physics Department.”

I asked her why a real estate company needs a physics department. 

And she looked at me, with this wild, almost frantic look.

“They’re not in the business of houses,” she said.

She told me a friend of hers, who worked in a division called Asset Integration, started talking about things overlapping, and ‘the seams in the world’. 

Then he just stopped coming into work. 

The woman leaned across the table.

“He went smooth,” she whispered. 

*Smooth?*

I asked her what that meant but she just shook her head. She looked like she was on the verge of vomiting. 

A white V van pulled into the diner parking lot. It moved slowly, its headlights cutting through the dawn mist. 

The woman saw it and went pale. She got up to leave, but I leaned over and grabbed her arm. I was desperate. 

“I’m losing time,” I blurted out. “I keep getting these flashes. They’re like memories, but they’re not mine.”

She looked at me, her expression softened for a second. 

“It’s too late,” she whispered, before yanking her arm away and bolting out the back door.

I sat alone with a cold cup of coffee.

Outside, the van lingered for almost an hour.

When it left, I went back to my van and locked the doors. 

I gripped the steering wheel, and screamed till I ran out of air. 

*What the fuck is happening?*

I was breathing too fast, I felt light headed. 

That’s when the next flash came. 

I was in another van. Similar to mine. There was a half-empty bottle of water in the cup holder and a laminated Kit48 checklist stuck to the visor with a binder clip. A phone was pressed to my ear, listening to a dial tone. The call went to voicemail.

“Isabel, Isabel, Isabel,” the voice sounded frantic. “Do you remember the dodgy swings near our primary school?”

I felt the words tumble from my mouth, unable to stop them. 

But it wasn’t my voice. 

It was Madey’s. 

Headlights filled the rearview mirror. 

I ended the call and tore through the van searching for something, anything. My fingers closed around a screwdriver on the passenger footwell. 

A figure grew closer in the side mirror. 

I was sobbing. Climbing over the back seat, desperate to get away. 

The driver side door opened. Someone grabbed my leg. 

I jolted from the vision. 

I need to find Madey.
