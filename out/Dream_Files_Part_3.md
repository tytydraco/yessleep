Hi everyone it’s Josiah. I apologize for leaving you on a cliffhanger. I needed to collect my thoughts and the story was starting to get long. That and Madison wanted to get to bed. Now after the events of the following day. I don’t really know what to think. Anyway here’s where we left off.

“Madison, when did you get the scar on your hand?”

“Josiah you know the story behind where it came from.”

“I’m sorry I’m a little on edge from the nightmare.”

“Ok I’ll remind you. It’s a birthmark. I’ve always had it and you had a tendency to make fun of it in high school.”

Yes I had a tendency to make fun of it. Everyone has their faults.

“She’s lying boy”

I heard a voice but didn’t know where it was coming from. I took a moment to scan the small apartment Madison and I live in. Nothing.

“Josiah, are you alright?”

“I swear I heard someone else in here.”

“I didn’t hear anything? Why don’t we go for a walk.”

“Yeah that’s probably best I think I need out of this place.”

As we were about to leave the apartment the voice spoke again.

“You can’t escape me you pathetic little shit.”

I ignored this threat and went on with the trip Madison had planned. We make our way out of the creek behind the apartment. Madison always knew what kept me sane. Ever since we got together.

She’s definitely the leader of our relationship. Always has been. I wouldn’t know what to do without her really. I was just a wondering soul before I met her. She put my life together, brought me back from a broken past that I just couldn’t forget. But now I’m just happy to be with her in one of my favorite places. A small shitty creek bed covered in corpses wait what?

Turns out we just walked into a crime scene that had yet to be investigated.

“Damn it well this ruins my plans for tonight.”

Said Madison angrily grabbing her phone.

“911 what’s ur emergency?” 

“Me and my boyfriend just found a bunch of corpses.”

“What kind of corpses?”

“Human.”

“Jesus, just stay right there some officers are on the way. Where are you at miss.”

“Past the small church on the south side of town.”

“Alright officers are on their way just hand tight.”

 We wait about 7 minutes for them to arrive. The first officer to arrive I’m not allowed to say his name but he said I can call him Dave.

“Howdy you two. You find thes holy shit.”

I haven’t specified the scene yet but it was something like this. 5 corpses all gutted. The intestines were moved into a pentagram. The bodies were placed at each point.

“Come to see my works have you boy”

I heard the voice again and started looking but saw nothing. The darkening sky of night made it difficult to see doesn’t help it was a new moon. 

More officers start arriving on scene at this point some vomiting as they see the sight. Dave walks up to me noticing I had heard something.

“What’s your name kid?”

“Josiah, sorry I thought I heard something.”

“Well Joe you’re in safe hands. We will need you both to stay for questioning. Sorry it’s just the procedure.”

“Not a problem Dave.” 

“If I may can I ask a couple questions?”

“Go ahead.”

“Did you notice anything odd happening over here these past couple days?”

“No I haven’t seen anything but I’ve been having these nightmares.”

“Joe, unrelated to our case here please get on track.”

“No i haven’t seen anything.”

Me and Dave turn our attention to one of the officers speaking to Madison.

“How are you miss?”

“Good. Well was good then we found them.”

“Well this kinda stuff happens unfortunately.”

“No it doesn’t, this is clearly not normal I can see it in everyone’s actions.”

“Madison.”

Said Dave taking over the conversation for the other officer. Dave proceeds to ask the same question and Madison responds with.

“I haven’t seen anything but this is clearly satanic. Listen Josiah’s been having nightmares for the past two days. If this is related we need to know.”

“I’m not sure I’m the one to ask for help on this and I doubt it’s satanic. Though the markings are definitely satanic. I just don’t think these are related.”

“He’s lying boy. He knows it is. He wants you to feel safe. You’re not safe anymore. You never will be.”

“GET OUT OF MY HEAD!”

This caught everyone’s attention and made Madison angry with Dave.

While Madison was busy arguing with Dave I was hearing his voice. Taunting me. Telling me where it was hidden. Showing me where it was. Where he hid the weapon to kill these innocents. 

I was now in the creek itself wading through water. Stumbling about like I’m drunk. I make my way further up the stream and find it. The weapon used to kill them.

“Do it kill them. Every last one.”

“No you do not control me.”

“JOE! Where you at Joe!”

“Down the creek, I found the weapon!”

The group makes there way over to me.
Madison making it first. Dave second. Then, oh shit. It was Traum. He was impersonating one of them.

“You fucker I’ll kill you!”

I yell rushing at Traum with nothing but my fist.

I then ran into a tree.

“Shit. You alright Joe.”

Said Dave holding down a laugh.

“No I think I broke my nose.”

“I got it.”

Madison walked up to me and said.

“Hold still ya dumb. This will hurt.”

She grabs my nose and yanks it back into place.

“Fuck me that hurt.”

Madison smiles and says.

“Maybe later, now come on tell us what happened just now.”

“I thought I saw Traum.”

“Who the hell’s Traum?”

Said Dave investigation the knife. 

“He’s the guy in my nightmares and I keep hearing him. I’m going insane. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”

“Have you tried taking control.”

Said one of the officers behind me and Madison.

“What?”

The officer was a Native American man. Likely Lakota native, they are most common in the area we are in.

“Try to take control, it’s one of the best ways to combat your nightmares.” 

So stupidly obvious I didn’t even think of it. Taking control of your dreams.

“How do i do that though?”

“Through lucid dreaming. After you wake up from sleep try sleeping again. You will drift in and out of sleep and eventually you will get into lucid dreaming and you will be able to take control.”

“Thank you for providing me with this information officer.”

Dave then interrupted and said that me and Madison were free to go.

“You both helped with this investigation. Thank you for your cooperation and thanks for being weird Joe.”

“Don’t mention it Dave it’s a pleasure.”

I heard him mutter something under his breath but payed little mind to it. I had a way to fight back. But it means spending more time in that hell Traum calls Paradise. 

Goodnight everyone sleep tight.
