Find my father's family, that's what she had said. I never met my grandparents on his side, barely knew my mother's parents until I moved in with them. So, I went straight home and got to work tracking down anyone related to my father. I remembered my father talking about his sister Caroline when I was younger, but I had never met her. I figured she was as good of a place to start as any. 

After searching Facebook, I found three Carolines that could be my long-lost aunt. The first said that she didn't have a brother, the second never answered me back and the third had died two years ago. The memorial page for her was ran by her daughter, a woman named Carla. I messaged Carla about who I was and who I thought her mom might be. To my surprise, she messaged back right away. She said she knew exactly who my father was and who I was. 

I messaged, “Ok, maybe you can help me figure this out. As I'm sure you know, my father was murdered 20 years ago, and as crazy as it sounds, I think his killer is back. I don't understand what's happening, but my mother told me to find my father's family and ask them.” 

She replied, “Yes, I’m sorry about your father. I’ve heard of the family curse, but I don't really believe it. My father told me the story before he died. Apparently one of our ancestors did some bad things to someone during the civil war and now every male member of our family is doomed to a bloody and brutal death. My dad died of a heart attack so like I said I don’t really believe it.” 

I replied, “Wow, okay that sounds pretty crazy. Is there any more you can tell me about the story?” 

She replied, “Not really. I do have some of my dad's old documents he kept on the family history, I can send you them if you like?” 

I replied, “Yes thank you that would be great.” 

25 minutes later I received a series of messages containing photos of documents chronicling my family's history all the way back to the 1700s. It didn't take me long to sort through the images and find the ones detailing “the Tennessee incident of 1865.” The story was detailed in the journal of my ancestor, a union soldier named Samuel. 

“June 3^(rd),1865.  

I fear that my fellows and I are damned. We arrived at Jonesborough on the long ride home to Kentucky. The men were hungry and saddle weary from days of riding, and we were in search of a bed and a bite to eat.  

We came upon a homestead late in the evening, Captain Connors approached the door and knocked, hoping to find some hospitality. Though we knew that if none could be found we could take as we wished, these were rebel homes after all. The young woman at the door told us she had no food nor beds for “Yankee bastards.” Like us. I was content to move on in search of some place more accommodating. Captain Connors and the men, however, were not. 

Without another word, the captain pushed through the door, knocking the woman aside. The men followed his lead, and after a moment of hesitation I also dismounted and headed inside. To my dying day, I will regret the decision to follow my captain into that house. The war was over; I had no more allegiance to Connors. But I was tired and hungry, and the road had been long. 

The woman protested but Connors and the men tied her to a post while we ate her food. When I had my fill, I found a comfortable place to lay my head for the night. Inevitably the men began to discuss the young woman, and who should go first. Connors announced that as captain he had the “right” to take her first. I had no interest in such things, so I took my leave of the house and made my bed in the barn outside, doing my best to block out the commotion from the house. 

The next morning, I awoke to the sounds of gunshots and men screaming. I flung off my saddle blanket and peered out the barn door. Evidently, the woman's reb husband had come home and found Connors and the men in his home. Connors stumbled out the house; a gunshot wound to his left arm. He spun and fired his revolver back into the house until it ran dry. I readied my rifle and took aim at the house as a man dressed in confederate gray streaked with red burst through the door. The man had blood on his hands and murder in his eyes as he approached Connors, a dripping bowie knife in his hand. I didn't hesitate; I fired. The ball taking the man straight in the chest. At once, he stumbled back and fell to his knees, a shocked look on his rage filled face.  

Slowly a few of the men that were still living stepped out of the house and surrounded the rebel. Connors stepped to his horse and pulled a second navy revolver from his saddle, just as the woman came running from the house to stand between the men and her husband. She screamed and raged at them, begging us to just leave. Connors shot her without hesitation. The rebel screamed in rage as he tried to rise at Connors, his knife still in hand. But he was easily knocked back to the ground. Suddenly, a young boy appeared from within the house, crying and screaming. Apparently, the mother had hidden the boy beneath the floorboards when she saw us approaching her home. The boy ran to his fallen parents and stood between them and Connors. 

I left the barn and approached Connors, I told him we should just leave, that the reb was as good as dead anyhow. But Connors wasn't done. Pushing the crying boy aside, he pried the knife from the dying man's hands and plunged it into his gut; the man screamed in pain and rage as tears flowed down his face. Connors ordered the men to pitch the woman and child inside the house and set it alight, then to string up a rope in the barn. I had to look away as they followed their orders. I mounted my horse and refused to watch as they strung up the broken and dying man, but I heard what he said.  

“You can kill me now, but I swear on all that is holy, I will find a way back and end each of you. I will reap my bloody vengeance upon every man in your bloodline if it's the last thing I d...” He went silent as the rope went taut. We left him hanging here, his home in a blaze. 

I continued to ride with Connors and the remaining men until we reached Kentucky, but I had all the death I could take. What we did was wrong, and I fear for my life and the lives of my sons. I see him in my dreams, and I hear his woeful song in the night. What have we done? What have we done?” 

 

“Jesus Christ.” I breathed. It was a horrible story, and my ancestor played a part in it. Could it be true? Was this some kind of vengeful spirit, coming to collect his due? I didn't know, but I was beginning to fear it was. I scrolled through the images until I found another journal entry from a woman named Elenore. 

“Nov. 15^(th), 1910 

Father has been killed. The county doctor has spent the past day scratching his head over the circumstances of his death, and our dolt of a sheriff has no more clever ideas on the incident either. The fool actually suggested the culprit was a blood sucking creature from Mexican folklore. Dr Evans and I told him exactly where he could stick that asinine theory. 

Still, it is peculiar that there was such little blood for such a gruesome death. For my part I am still reeling from finding daddy in such a state. The image of his body crumpled at the foot of the porch; his throat tore open like that. It was truly awful. 

Dr. Evans believes from the wound, it was some kind of animal attack. But for the life of him he cannot attribute a single culprit to it. I suppose it does not matter; daddy is gone and soon we will lose the farm.” 

 

I realized I had been holding my breath as I read the journal entry. Was this describing what it sounded like? It couldn't be, could it?  

I scrolled through the documents, reading several other entries detailing the deaths of the men of my family. More times than not, it was the same story; a horrific wound to the neck and a mysteriously small amount of blood at the scene.  

Those were just myths and fairytales, I told myself. And yet I had seen him, shot at him. My throat felt dry as I closed the Messager app and opened up a new search tab. I let out a single grim chuckle at the insanity of the situation as I began my research into vampirism. 

 

Over the next few hours, I learned a lot about the history and origins of vampires. In the Middle Ages they believed vampires came about due to a sudden unexpected death, suicide, or an improper burial. To deter the dead from rising, bodies were often buried face down and covered with stones or heavy items. Then in the 1700s and 1800s came stories of creatures called strigoi and uppier. Beings that rose from their graves in the night to feed on the life force or blood of the living. It was said that they came about from those who died violently or lived sinful lives. Then came Bram Stoker in 1897, and the idea of vampires and vampirism was forever changed. Holy water, garlic, crucifixes, all that good stuff.  

If I was right, and I couldn't believe I was saying this but, If I was being hunted by a vampire. At least one of the old myths was already proven false. He had been inside my house, toying with me, so he didn't need to be invited in. I could go in circles with this all night, reading stories and theorizing. The only thing I knew for sure was that I had only seen him at night, so maybe that myth was true. And if that was true, he had to have somewhere to rest during the day, didn't he? But where could it be? 

And then it hit me. Shady Grove. According to Susan, mom had been whistling more and more for the past couple weeks. and that day I visited her, she saw something, hell even I saw something across the garden in the unfinished wing of the home. 

 I looked out the window at the afternoon sun; there was still time, if I hurried. 

Ben picked up on the third ring, “Hey partner, what's up?” 

“Ben” I said wasting no time. “I need your help, right now. Don't ask any questions, just meet me out in front of your house. Bring your lasso and a gun.” 

There was a moment of pause on the line, then he said. “Alright, I'll be waiting.” 

I picked him up ten minutes later and we were on our way. 

“You wanna tell me what we are doing?” Asked Ben as he looked at the speedometer, “and maybe slow down a tick so we don't get pulled over.” 

I looked down, I was doing 90 and the dial was rising. I let off the gas a touch and turned to him, “How long have we been friends?”  

“Since high school, I reckon.” Said Ben. 

“And you trust me, right?” I asked. 

Ben gave me a look, “Well you're making it a bit tough right now but yeah, I trust you.” 

I nodded, “Good. We’re on our way to the Shady Grove care home to kill a vampire that has been stalking my family since the 1800s.” 

Ben stared at me for a moment then said, “Huh. Ok. Well, I'm assuming you have a plan for the uh...” he trailed off. 

“Vampire. Yeah. I think I know where he's sleeping. If we can get him into the sunlight, it may kill him or at least weaken him enough to kill him.” 

“I see you've thought this through then.” He said. 

“I have.”  

Ben nodded again, ‘Alright.” 

And on we drove.  

45 minutes later we pulled into the Shady Grove parking lot. Ben and I got out of the car and made our way around the building. An orderly at one of the exits saw us and gave us a questioning look. I waved at him and held up the toolbox I was carrying. “Don't mind us, we’re just doing some checks on the new addition.” The orderly smiled and waved back, giving us a nod. 

When we pushed through the doors on the addition, Ben grabbed my arm, “Hey man, how far are you taking this?”  

I turned back to him, “As far as it takes. I have to keep my family safe.”  

“I don't know about this, Jim.” He said, shaking his head. 

“Just trust me a little longer. If we get in there and there's no vampire, you have my full permission to knock me in the head and admit me to an asylum, okay?” 

Ben sighed and nodded, “Let's just get on with this.”  

Once we were inside, we began our search. We scoured the first floor and came up empty, then we moved on to the second floor. We searched every room, every closet, and still there was nothing.  

“Okay, we’ve searched.” Said Ben. “Now do you have a preference on which asylum I send you to?” 

I sighed, “I don't know what to say. I really thought we would find him.” 

“Jim, I don't think there is him. I think you need help. Have you spoken to your therapist?”  

I deflated under the question. “No... But, I will.”  

Ben nodded, “Come on partner, let's get you home.” 

I nodded back and we turned to head for the stairs. “Thank you for coming with me Ben. You’re a good friend.” 

I took my first step down the staircase but then noticed Ben’s silence. I turned back to face him, “Ben?” 

He was frozen, staring up at the ceiling over the stairwell. I stepped back to look up at what he was looking at. There, hanging upside down from the ceiling, his arms crossed and his eyes closed, was a god damn vampire.  

“Maybe we can share a padded cell.” Mumbled ben. 

I hushed him and sat down the toolbox. Opening it and removing a large hunting knife, a crucifix and some garlic oil. “Got your rope?” I asked Ben. 

He nodded out of his stupor and sat down the toolbox he had been carrying. Pulling from it a handgun and a lasso. He shakily checked the chamber of his pistol, making sure it was loaded and slipped it into his back pocket.  

I stepped to the back of the room and pulled down a large westward facing tarp that was covering an unfinished wall, revealing the lowering evening sun.  

“What's the plan here?” Asked Ben. 

I came back and stood beside him, pouring the garlic oil onto the knife blade. “Well, you just rope him and then we pull him to the sunlight, and I stab him with this. If that doesn't work, shoot him in the head until he stops moving.” 

“This is fucking insane!” Said ben in a panicked whisper.  

“I know, but here we are, and we are running out of time.” I said, motioning to the setting sun.  

“Shit. Alright let's do this.” He said as he prepared his rope. Mumbling something under his breath about, “Son of a bitch got me out her after a god damn vampire.” 

Ben twirled the lasso overhead once, twice, three times, and then let it fly. His aim was good, but the vampire's eyes sprung open just as he cinched the rope tight around his chest. I grabbed the rope and we both ran backwards, dragging the flailing creature into the setting sunlight. The vampire immediately burst into flames and began shrieking in an awful high and low pitch at the same time. He flailed and flopped, kicking out and trying to get loose. In what felt like minutes but was actually just seconds, the vampire withered to an ash coated skeleton. 

Ben and I looked at each other in disbelief. Then to the dead creature on the ground in front of us.  

“People were sure to have heard that.” Said Ben. 

I nodded, “Yeah, we should go.”  

“What about the body?” He asked.  

I looked around the room, “There, the tarp.”  

As fast as we could, we gathered there smoldering bones and clothes into the tarp and rolled it up before quickly making a dash for the car and stowing the remains in the trunk. Neither of us spoke on the drive home. We couldn't, what was there to say? 

I dropped a sick looking Ben off at his house without saying a word and headed home. When I pulled into the driveway, Grace and Shawn were already home. I got out and greeted my wife in the driveway. “What are you doing home? I thought you were staying at your moms.” 

“I was, but there was an emergency at work. I would have left Shawn with mom, but she had the flu. I've been trying to call you.” she said, then after looking me over she asked, “Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost or something.”  

I tried to smile, “Or something.” I echoed.  “Yeah, I think I'm alright. But we need to talk.”  

She touched my arm "Of course, honey. But can it wait till I get home? I have a heart transplant in 30 minutes.” 

I looked back at the trunk of my car and nodded, “Yeah, I think so.” 

She smiled and kissed my cheek. “Shawns had dinner, but he still needs a bath. I'm glad you're feeling better.” 

“Me too.” I smiled then kissed her before she left. 

I went inside and found Shawn watching Scooby doo. I sat down and watched with him for a while. Knowing now that the monsters were actually sometimes monsters. After getting my son a bath and into bed. I went and took a lobster boil of a shower myself, feeling a weight lifting from my shoulders. Mom was speaking again, maybe she could make a full recovery. I knew now what had killed my father, and I had killed it. Avenging him, saving myself, my son and the rest of the men in my bloodline. I was beginning to feel pretty good all things considered. Then my phone went off. It was a text from Ben 

“Hey partner, need to talk with you. Come over, now.” 

He was shaken up; I didn't blame him. Finding out vampires exist just minute before you kill one would send anyone over the edge. I text back, “Okay, just put Shawn to bed. Be over in a bit.” 

We still keep a baby monitor in Shawns' room since my office is downstairs and across the house. I keep the receiver with me when I work late so I can hear of he needs anything. I got dressed and put the receiver into my back pocket before heading over to Ben's house. 

When I got there, I saw that his shop lights were on. Ben had converted the metal frame work shop in his backyard into a bar. He had a dance floor, a jukebox, plenty of booze and everything a good ol boy needs to have a good time. I pushed the door open to see Ben sitting at the bar, his back to me. 

“Hey.” I said approaching him, “You okay, pal?” 

He didn't answer.  

“Ben?” I said as I reached out and spun the barstool around. 

Ben's head flopped back loosely as he spun, revealing his torn open throat and shattered spine. 

I stumbled back in shock, falling to the floor. Ben's head leaned so far back that the remaining flap of skin stretched until it snapped. His head fell to the floor with a wet thud.  

Suddenly the jukebox blared to life. I turned to see him. His back to me as he leaned over the jukebox. His burnt clothes hanging on him like rags. His sickly gray skin covered in fresh burn scars. He tapped his charred boot to the beat as Garth brooks, friends in low places began to echo through the room. The vampire turned to face me, licking blood from his fingernails. 

“Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.” He laughed, “My how you've grown. What's it been? 20 years?” 

I tried to move but I was paralyzed with fear, struggling to even drag in a breath. 

“Oh, but you didn't see me back then, did you? No, just good ol mom.” He laughed again as he took one of Ben’s Stetsons off the wall and placed it on his head before two stepping across the floor towards me.  

I leapt to my feet and ran for the door; the vampires laugh following me all the way. “Where ya runnin to Jimmy boy?” He called after me.  

I hit the door as I pulled my phone from my pocket, dialing the sheriff's office as I ran. After 5 long rings the dispatcher answered, “Sherrif's department this is...” 

But I cut her off before she could finish, “Debbie, I need someone here now!” I screamed, “He killed him! God, he killed Ben!”  

“Jim? Is that you? Slow down, who killed who? What's going on?” She asked.  

“Dammit Debbie, there's no time. I need help now!” I demanded. 

“Aright, Jim, Sheriff Ward is in the area, I’ll send him by and...”  

But I didn't listen to the rest. I hung up just as I slammed through my front door. I ran upstairs and was headed for my shotgun when I remembered the garlic oil and the knife, still in my car. I turned and ran back downstairs and out to the car, grabbing the knife and stuffing the small bottle of garlic oil into my pocket before bolting back through the front door. I ran to my room and grabbed my shotgun, ejecting the shells and prying them open with the knife before pouring some of the oil over the pellets inside. I slapped a piece of tape over the tip if each shell, hoping it would be enough to hold them closed and reloaded the shotgun. 

 Suddenly there came a heavy thud on the roof, followed by footsteps. And then he started singing that damn song again. I ran to Shawn’s room and scooped him up in one arm.  

“Ooh death...” 

“Dad? What's going on? Where are we going?” He asked sleepily. 

“Don't worry buddy, we’re gonna go pick up momma then we are all going on a trip. But right now, I need you to hold on tight to me and keep quiet, can you do that for me?” 

He rubbed his eyes and looked at me, “Is this like a game or something?”  

“Yeah.” I said. Holding him tight and heading down the stairs. “It's just like a game, you gotta keep quiet, hold on to me and keep your eyes closed tight, got it?”  

“Okay.” He said, burying his head in my shoulder. 

“I love you, Shawn.” I said, tears rolling down my face. 

“Love you dad.” He said, his little voice muffled from my shoulder.  

I was at the front door, wondering if I could make it to my car when flashing red and blue came around the corner and pulled into my driveway. I flung the door open and stepped outside to meet them. 

“Jim.” Said Sheriff Ward stepping out of his patrol car, “What the hell's going on? What are you doing with that gun?”  

Another patrol car pulled up next to him, and a deputy stepped out, meeting the Sheriff as they walked up the driveway.  

“Sheriff it's the intruder from the other night he’s...”  

“Aw, is that what is this about? Dammit Jim.” Groaned the Sheriff, “You have got to stop...” 

He was cut off as he was suddenly hit by a lightning-fast blur of movement from the side of the yard. He didn't even have time to scream. The blur, along with the sheriff, disappeared through a tall hedge next to the house. The deputy froze, a splash of blood across his face.  

“Sh... Sheriff?” The deputy muttered. 

“OoOh death...” 

The moment stretched as we stood still listening. I slowly began to back up to the house, when the blur of motion came again. When it passed, the hand the deputy had been reaching for his weapon with, was gone. He looked down at the ragged, bleeding stump in confusion for a moment, then he started screaming. The screaming came to a sudden stop when the vampire shot up behind him and shoved his hand through the deputy's chest, ripping out a chunk of gore. The vampire looked up at me and licked the bloody chunk as the deputy fell to the ground.  

I raised the shotgun and fired one of the garlic-coated rounds. This time he was too close to dodge the shot. It caught him full in the chest, and he screeched in pain, falling to the ground and writhing before crawling on all fours like a spider into the hedge. Shawn still had his head buried in my shoulder but was now screaming as I ran to the deputy’s car and jumped inside. I put Shawn in the passenger seat and told him, “Keep your eyes shut, no matter what you hear.” 

He nodded and squeezed them shut as I put the car in reverse and hit the gas, but the car didn't move. I turned back around to see the vampire holding onto the brush guard. I gritted my teeth and put the car into drive and floored it. 

The vampire's eyes widened in the brief moment before he disappeared under the hood of the patrol car. His body crunched under the tires as I plowed forward, smashing the car through the front of my house. Bricks and wood and sheetrock showered down over the car. I glanced at the rear-view mirror and could already see him, jerkily rising to his feet. His body, broken and misshapen. I put the car in reverse and hit the gas, but it couldn't move.  

The windshield was cracked, so I threw the deputy's jacket over Shawn and used the butt of the shotgun to bash the glass loose. We climbed out through the open windshield and ran up the stairs to my bedroom. Opening the closet, I pushed Shawn inside. 

“Daddy?” He cried. “What's happening.”  

I hugged him tight and told him I loved him, “Stay in here, please Shawn. Close your eyes, cover your head, and keep quiet. Remember the game? I want you to win, okay?” 

He nodded as tears poured down his face, and I closed the closet door as I heard the sound of footsteps and whistling coming up the stairs. 

I turned to face him as he stepped through the doorway. I raised the shotgun. Ready to blow his undead head off, instead he dashed forward before I could react. Knocking the shotgun away and lifting me up by my throat.  

“You have given me quite the fight, Jimmy boy. Quite a fight indeed.” He said, speaking through gritted teeth.  

I tried to speak but with his grasp on my throat, all I could do was wheeze.  

“What's that? Got something to say?” he asked mockingly, “I couldn't quite hear you.” 

He loosened his grip and I drug in a ragged breath, “Your vengeance is bullshit.” I spat. “I had nothing to do with what happened to you. Neither did my son, or any of the men you’ve killed.”  

“What do you know about what happened to me?” He snarled.  

“I know enough.” 

“You know nothing!” He yelled. 

“I know,” I coughed, “this isn't what they would have wanted.”  

He squeezed tighter, “What do you know about what they would have wanted? You think they’d want mercy for you?! Or them?!” He shouted, bloody spit flying from his lips. “The ones who raped and murdered my wife?! Burned my son alive! Should I have shown them mercy?!” 

“I don't mean for me.” I wheezed. “They wouldn't have wanted this for you.” 

The vampire gritted his teeth and closed his eyes for a moment.  

“You can stop. Just stop, let it be over.” I pleaded. 

He shook his head and opened his orange-red eyes, “It's too late for me. And it's too late for you.” And then he leaned forward and sunk his teeth into my neck. 

The pain was unlike anything I ever felt. My throat felt like it was filled with hot coals, as I felt my life draining away, one drop at a time. I prayed it would be over soon and he would just leave. That he wouldn't find Shawn. I felt cold rising from my feet, up my legs, and in my arms. I was dying, and then suddenly I was free. I fell to the floor in a heap as the vampire stumbled back. The garlic coated knife stuck in his side.  

“Get away from my dad!” Yelled Shawn. 

The vampire stared down at the knife then at Shawn. I somehow found enough strength to climb to my knees and crawled over to put myself between my son and the monster. 

He stared down at me, then to back to Shawn, then down at the knife. With a hiss, he pulled the blade from his side and stepped back. He could have killed us; there was nothing we could have done to stop him. But instead, he nodded to my son then turned and just left. It was over. 

I told the investigators that I didn't know what had happened to the sheriff and deputy. I said that after I found Ben’s body and called the Sheriff's department, I went home and holed up in my room with Shawn. That I didn't see what had happened downstairs. 

 I told Grace the truth; I think she believes me; she says she does. I know how it sounds though; I wouldn't blame her if she didn't. There has been no sight or sound of the vampire since we moved into the new house. No, we won't be moving around like we did when I was a kid, just needed a change of scenery. Mom is recovering, sort of. There are times when she seems aware and will even talk some, but then she retreats back into herself for days at a time. I recovered from the bite surprisingly fast. What had been four huge puncture wounds is now barely even a scar. I feel different too, more aware of things, stronger. Maybe I'm finally beginning to heal some of my old trauma. The sun feels hotter now too, I'm sure everything is fine though.
