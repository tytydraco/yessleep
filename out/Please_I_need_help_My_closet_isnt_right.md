I’m not making any of this up. I know that whoever is reading this will think it’s fake. Part of me wonders why I’m posting this because even if someone thinks this is real I don’t know how anyone could help with what is happening here. My closet opens up to a street. I don’t know how and I don’t know why, but, it’s opening up to a street that shouldn’t possibly be there. 



Firstly, I’m not insane, because my mother sees it, too. I had to move back in with her after reaching my breaking point with my job. I couldn’t handle the stress and I needed to take time for myself, and my mother was nice enough to let me move back in with her to try and recover and get back on my feet. I had no other place I could go since the few friends I had were all married with families. I wouldn’t let myself go and ruin their dynamics even if they offered to let me stay with them. And if you’re wondering, yes, we already tried the damn police, but trying to tell the police, “Hey, the door to my closet is opening up to something impossible” goes about as well as you’d think. We tried to think of ways to tell them to investigate the door with us. We told the police we believed some broke in and tampered with our closet before fleeing the scene. The 911 operator, however, stated that there was nothing that could be done as the supposed perpetrator would already be gone, so we’d need to come down to the station to fill a report and give witness testimony to what the supposed criminal looked like. We didn’t try much after that. My initial idea before the call was to tell them someone was hiding in our closet, but my mom made the right decision in trying the approach we went with, even if it didn’t get us help. If we used what I came up with, they’d come to investigate the closet and open the door to that fucking place again. With everything we know now, that might’ve gotten innocent bystanders killed.



So, to give every detail I possibly can, I’ll start from when I moved back in. The room that the closet is in is my mother's old room that she let me use to sleep in once I came back here. Nice and big with a walk-in bathroom and walk-in closet. If you’re wondering, she made my old room her room a few years back because she was getting nightmares sleeping in the room the closet is in, and I’m only now wondering if there is any correlation. So, I moved back in and the first few nights were fine. Each day I’d help her out with stuff around the house. My mother is in her sixties, so she’s starting to have trouble doing all the housework by herself. I was helping her clean up around the place, weeding the garden she planted out back after I left, everything I could since she was letting me live rent-free while I was job hunting. It was only on the fifth night when things started to happen. At first, it was just little things you could write off with reasonable explanations. The door would creak open at times, and I’d just assume my fan was blowing it open from time to time. I’d sometimes hear a faint hum of a light bulb, assuming the ceiling lights needed to be replaced soon.



But what started to make me understand that this wasn’t normal was the seventh night. That night, I was having trouble sleeping, so I was up late on my laptop surveying some jobs in the area that would be low-stress so I could stay working and building money back up in my savings account. The closet was slowly creaking open, which scared me but I was just assuming it was like the other nights. But the light was on inside the closet. I knew I didn’t turn it on. I got the hell out of the room after that, because I’ve seen enough horror movies to be paranoid at every little bump in the night. The previous nights were freaky, but I was able to rationalize them in my head. I **knew** the closet light wasn’t on last I checked though. I slept on the couch that night. I went back into the room the next day and, sure enough, the closet door was shut. That previous night was clear as day to me even then, but I was dumb enough to wonder if I had dreamt the whole damn thing up. I went on with my day mostly normally.



But that night, while I was sleeping, I got woken up by the creaking sound of the door. I’m a light sleeper, so hearing that was enough to get me up. And I opened my eyes before moving, seeing it slowly creek open more and more. But when I sat up, it stopped opening. I still do not know why, I wish I knew why but I don’t, I slowly got up to close the door. But when I went to, I peeked inside. And it was a fucking street. Instead of the closet, it was a street that stretched on as far as I could see. The doorway was in the center of the road, a road which seemed to be surrounded by a grassy plain by all sides in the middle of nowhere. The two sides of the street had lamp posts across from each other on that were separated by three meters, this pattern continuing to the horizon where the road also stretched. Almost all the lamps were on, with a few exceptions far down the road. I was just standing there like a deer in headlights. I was dumb enough to shut the door and re-open it to just see if I was seeing shit, but it was the same scenery. The only difference was that more of the lamp's lights had gone out between the moments of the closet door being shut and then re-opened. I shut it again before walking out of my room. I think I was just delirious or something because I don’t even fully remember how I acted. My mom told me I was pale and I just told her to follow me so I could show her something. That’s when I remember opening the door once again with her beside me, the road still there for both of us to see, with even more lamps out. There wasn’t much light illuminating the road now. Just scattered pieces of light trying to paint the picture for my mother and me.



But more lamps being out wasn’t the only difference this time. We heard something. Large and in the distance at a rhythmic pattern. It sounded like wet, ten-pound heavy bags of raw meat slapping the pavement, a quarter of a second of silence between each slap. And each slap sounded just a bit closer, and with the speed of the noise, it was quickly becoming louder. I panicked and slammed the door shut before me and my mother boarded it up with the dresser nearby to keep it shut. And that leads us to now. It’s the morning after that incident. We’re not sure what to do. We can’t get the police involved, and we have no idea what is going on. We need help, please.



A small note to add to the end of this before I post it. My mom said that she swore she heard a soft knock at the door a few minutes ago when she was pacing around inside the room. I don’t know what’s going on. Please, any advice is appreciated.
