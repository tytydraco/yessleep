There is a strange urban legend. of young girls being attacked in their own home! by some guy in a black leather full bodysuit called the Gimp Man. I never thought I'd encounter this man. But I did! And I am still scared of him!  
  
Okay so this all started earlier this week. After me and my boyfriend Bob and I were going through a rough spot in our relationship. So, I was left alone at our shared country house during the afternoon. As I was watching some Netflix, I heard a knock at my door!  
  
I was about to answer it. When I got a text from my neighbor Cassie! I read “Jill the Gimp Man at your door”! Before she then texted me the photo. I dropped my phone and then the knocking stopped!  
  
And then I heard a window break! And then my boyfriend Bob texted me “Jill are you alright”? I texted Bob back “no there's someone in our house”! Bob then texted me “Jill you need to find somewhere to hide now”!   
  
So, as I was frantically looking for somewhere to hide, I got another text from bob. It read as “Jill i have you found a hiding spot”? I texted bob back “no I’m still looking”! Bob texted me “Jill I will be there in 15 minutes ok”!   
  
As I was frantically looking for somewhere to hide. I saw the gimp man opening up our bedroom door! Without hesitation I locked myself in the bathroom! I was waiting for Bob to text me back. I could hear the gimp man banging on the door!   
  
But after 15 minutes it stopped. And I heard Bob's voice coming from behind the door and he said “Jill you can come out now it's safe”! I opened the door and me and Bob got in his car which was parked in the alley and drove.  
  
I asked him “Bob, how did you scare off the Gimp Man”? Bob said “I threatened him with a gun”! As we were driving to Bob's house, I got a text from Cassie reading “how did Bob get into your house”? I texted Cassie “what do you mean” Cassie texted back “he was not seen entering the house”!  
  
I was confused but I did not want to ask Bob how he got into my house! My gut was trying to tell me something. Bob bought us a motel room for the night. As we got into the room bob was carrying a garbage bag!  
  
He took it into his room. and when he left, I went into his room! I looked around but saw nothing until I looked under his bed! I saw the gimp costume of the man who attacked me! And then I heard a window break.  
I opened the door a smidge. and saw Bob holding his gun at someone in the kitchen! I couldn’t make out who yet! And then Bob said “hey I’m warning you get away from me”! Before a saw a knife gets thrown into Bob's neck!   
  
When Bob fell onto the floor. I saw who he was talking to! It was another Gimp Man! He picked up Bob and said “this is what happens to imposters”! Before leaving through the front door with bob! I guess there were other Gimp men!
