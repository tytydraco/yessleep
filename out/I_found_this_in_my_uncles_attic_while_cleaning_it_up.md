THIS IS NOT A FORMAL LAB REPORT

NONE OF THE NAMES THAT YOU SEE ARE THE REAL NAMES OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED


I have decided to leave notes on everything that is happening since I have noticed strange events in the lab lately and I need to leave a report as I would for any of the discoveries that I would make during day-to-day work.


About five months ago, muffled whispering noises began coming from my desk every time that I would sit there. The main voice I was picking up sounded like a high pitched whale, similar to that of a small child. The voice of someone comforting them whispered to them.

I had been meaning to get a new desk for years and I thought that this “creaking” noise was as good an excuse as any to buy myself my dream one. 

My new desk, within the span of a week, started making the same noises each time I worked nearby.

I tried to simply dismiss the idea that this was something supernatural. I mean, it is a million times more likely for the sounds to be caused by another faulty desk than something undiscovered by man.

In the lab, we are working on many things which cannot be disclosed here and since I take this report home and everything that is worked on is classified, I can not discuss what we are working on. 

I had been using the lab for my own experiments. My daughter has liver cancer and I felt that the lab was the only place where I had the instruments to actually make a difference in her downward spiral.

The experiments that I had been running resulted in many failures (including the time I accidentally made a small explosion in my office).

The reason I have included this in my report is because I worry that my experiments may have led to these awful mumbling sounds since the problems now seem to be caused by the room rather than the desk.

I began to realize that the crowded talking noises got louder whenever I got close to them and completely disappeared whenever someone else entered the room or was on call with me. It was almost like it was taunting me.

The noise got louder each day and I could hardly stand it. I felt as if I was losing my mind.

Around three months ago (two months after the events I have just recounted), I threw the new desk away and replaced it with an old foldable table. I had used this table to play board games with my family and friends and it had never caused me any trouble. If this table started speaking, I would be almost certain that the problem was not with age but instead with something happening inside the lab.

When I walked into work with that flimsy supermarket table, I felt so many eyes watching me. Everyone seemed shocked that I was replacing my new desk.

One coworker, Josh, felt the need to ask me if he could have the desk.

I looked at him with eyes as wide as golf balls, “No, absolutely not!” That was what my response was. I remember it because of how drastically he reacted to it.

Josh immediately slapped me across the face.

I still didn’t give him the desk. I wouldn’t wish the noises on anyone, not even Josh as crazy as he is.


Within days, the foldable table started to talk just like the other two before it. 

I was freaking out. I brought the table home with me after work, determined to find out the source of the noise.

I don’t know why I reacted the way I did. Maybe it was Josh. Maybe it was the fact that the raspy children's voice made me want to rip my ears off. Maybe it was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. I don’t know but I had to figure out where it was coming from. All I know is that I grabbed an axe and swung it directly into the smooth plastic surface. 

I tore the table apart and found nothing. In fact, to make matters worse, I cannot remember the table making any noise after I had brought it home.

The next day, I decided to bring a piece of the table to work to see if it would start whispering and chose to move my project to the floor of my office since most of it could be done on a laptop rather than having to be done hands on.

Not too long into my work week, the piece of table began to whimper just as I had expected.

I took the crooked chunk of plastic out of my pocket and held it close to my ear.

I felt the plastic melting in my hand and pouring down my sleeve but when I turned to look it was no longer in my hand. I lifted my sleeve to see if it had just poured down my arm but that was not the case. It had vanished straight out of my hand. There was no other justification that could be made. The plastic was simply just gone. To add to my confusion, when I got home I noticed that the broken pieces I had left in my garage were also no longer there.


Now I have become aware of many strange things in the workplace. The speaking is no longer coming from a desk but instead, it is coming from the three walls separate from the entrance.

When I ask my associates if they can hear what I hear, they simply dismiss it and act like I am crazy.

I am beginning to believe that I am crazy.

I guess that is why I am even writing this report. I want to get an answer. 

I can live with being crazy and I can certainly live with being sane. But I don’t think I can live with not knowing.
