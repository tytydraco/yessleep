I woke up the next morning with a bit of a headache. Groaning at the harsh sunlight coming through my window, I blinked the sand out of my eyes. It took me until my vision was clear for me to notice that my bedroom door, which I always made sure to close and lock before I went to sleep, was standing wide open. Like rusted gears starting to grind together, my waking mind slowly began to remember the strange crawling thing in the hallway I had glimpsed just before falling asleep.

I’ve always been a bit paranoid, and this paranoia had only increased after I started living alone. Reaching into my pillowcase, I carefully extracted a pocket knife that I keep hidden there, just in case. I hesitated before getting out of bed. I sat there, listening for a few minutes, trying to hear if there was any sound in my house. I couldn’t tell for certain, there was no way of knowing, but it felt like I could hear a faint wheezing under my bed, as if someone was struggling faintly for breath.

Or trying to stifle laughter.

I’d always had a fear of stepping out of bed. I didn’t like the gap between the floor and the bed frame, it always felt like there was just enough room for someone to hide down there. When I was much younger, sometimes I’d remain confined in bed for hours if I was home alone, afraid that if I stepped my foot upon the ground, I’d feel a clammy hand wrap gnarled fingers around my ankle.

Slowly, very slowly, I looked down over the edge of the bed, knife clutched tight in my sweaty fingers. For a split second I thought I saw a shadow shift, slightly, as though something ever so subtly had skirted out of view. I swallowed, fear making my heart race in my chest. I counted down from 10, but didn’t dare close my eyes. When I reached 1, I leapt out of bed, immediately crouching down and lifting the bed spread, knife raised to strike at whatever was hiding there.

Nothing.

There wasn’t even enough room beneath my bed for anyone to fit; boxes of old childhood toys and knick knacks had filled up all the remaining space down there. Setting the knife down on my bedside table, I rubbed my temples, taking deep breaths to try and calm myself down.

*There’s nobody else in the house, Trinity*, I thought to myself, *you’re just being paranoid.*

I felt my stomach growl, and remembered how little I had eaten the previous day. Realizing I’d have to actually go out and buy food before I could feed myself, I sighed and put on some clothes, slipping my car keys and wallet into my jacket pocket.

“Find everything you were looking for today si-,” said the cashier, catching herself mid-word as she looked closer at me, eyes drifting towards my neck and shoulders.

“Just fine, thank you,” I replied, not having any energy to even acknowledge this sort of thing.

The cashier just nodded and started scanning my groceries, mercifully choosing to eschew the usual small talk one expects from such interactions, though I couldn’t help but recall how chatty she had been with the elderly man immediately before me in line.

As I sat there, patiently waiting for her to finish with my items, I yawned a little, peering around my surroundings. I used to work in a grocery store just like this one, years ago. It was one of my very first jobs. It was always remarkable to me how similar chain stores looked on the inside, like they were procedurally generated levels in some video game, the same assets being assembled pseudo-randomly to create familiar spaces. My train of thought was interrupted when my idle gaze fell upon the monitor above the cashier’s head.

Where there ought to be the total I was supposed to pay, or an advertisement, or even just a blank screen, there was something murky, shadowed, slowly coming into focus. It seemed to be brightening, just a little at a time, a still image congealing out of the void of black pixels, long stringy black hair obscuring a face twisted into something almost resembling a smil-

“Alright, that’ll be 67.95.”

I jumped slightly at the cashier’s voice, hoping that she didn’t notice. “Of course, sorry,” I murmured, fumbling for my wallet and grabbing my credit card. The cashier just sighed almost imperceptibly. While I clumsily inserted the card into the chip reader, I looked up at the monitor, simply seeing my purchase’s total and a list of the items that had been scanned.

After being handed my receipt, I thanked the cashier, grabbed my bags and headed out the automatic door. I chanced a glance backwards on my way out, just to see if I could catch a glimpse of the image on the monitor again, but it was still normal. Just an ordinary checkout screen. I shook my head and made my way back to the car.

Maybe it wasn’t the wisest idea to take a night walk, given the odd events of the previous day, but in my defense at this point I was still operating under the assumption that whatever was going on was merely a consequence of stress and paranoia. I didn’t want to believe that I was in any real danger.

I’ve been taking night walks ever since the divorce, mainly to try and work through my fear of the dark. I felt embarrassed being in my mid 20s and still needing to sometimes keep the light on when I went to bed. Frankly I probably would have started taking the walks sooner, but Seth never felt comfortable with me going outside alone after nightfall. To my credit, the walks did genuinely work to quell some of my nyctophobia. I still didn’t exactly feel comfortable in the dark, but it wasn’t nerve wracking anymore.

One of my favorite spots for nocturnal wanderings was somewhere I had perhaps melodramatically christened the “midnight river.” It was a bit of water district infrastructure, an artificial creek of sorts that passed between the vast blocks of identical suburban homes, with gravel maintenance paths on both sides. I wasn’t supposed to be there, to be clear. There was a fence with a sign warning me that trespassers would be prosecuted, but frankly I didn’t really care. In my mind, the purpose of this sort of sign was to prevent people from going there to toss their trash, spray graffiti, and otherwise pollute or clog the waterway. All I was doing was taking a little walk. It may have been against the letter of the law, but in terms of crimes it was a fairly victimless one.

Hopping over the fence was easy enough; it wasn’t exactly tall, and there were plenty of foot and hand holds. After I was over the barrier, I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out my phone, tapping the flashlight button. Even though I’d worked through a lot of my fear of darkness, the midnight river still could be somewhat unsettling at times. You see, if you are walking around after dark in the city or suburbs, there is still going to be quite a bit of ambient light, due to streetlamps, advertising billboards, 24 hour convenience stores, etc. The midnight river, however, was nearly entirely pitch black. It was squeezed between lines of suburban homes, with the tall wooden fences of backyards forming walls that enclosed the entire space. The only places for light to get through were the chain link fences at each end of the midnight river, with everything in between being smothered in a blanket of perfect, inky blackness.

It can actually be quite pleasant once you get used to only being able to see a few feet in front of you. The air was filled with the sound of croaking frogs to my immediate right, along with the gentle babbling of flowing water. This mixed with the crunching of gravel underfoot into a soothing melange of ambient noise.

The walk along the midnight river isn’t especially long, maybe 15 minutes at most. I think it must have been about 5 minutes into my short journey that I heard the echo. It was subtle, difficult to notice, but once I had realized it was there, I was unable to ignore it; about a quarter second after each of my footsteps, I would hear another footstep from somewhere behind me.

I didn’t dare pause to turn around, though I desperately wanted to. I worried that if I stopped moving, whatever was hiding in my footsteps would realize I’d caught onto its presence and attack me. My mind was racing, trying to think of what the source of the sound could be. *Mountain lions sometimes come down from the hills and wander into the suburbs*, I thought to myself in a panic, *or maybe it’s some maniac looking for an easy victim*. My neck itched with the desire to turn and look at my pursuer, my free hand reaching down automatically to grip the handle of my pocket knife.

This continued for quite some time, the footsteps slowly but surely seeming to get ever so slightly closer. It was clear that even though my pursuer was matching my pace, they must have had a slightly longer stride, allowing them to gradually gain on me. I had to think of something, but every possible method of self defense seemed somehow insufficient, like bows and arrows against the lightning. I felt weak, small, and vulnerable. Without any ability to gain information about whoever or whatever was following me, my mind jumped to the worst possible conclusions to fill the gaps in perception.

Eventually I could see light at the end of the river, shining from a streetlamp through the gaps in the chain link fence.

I realized that I was going to have to climb the fence in order to get out.

It must have been about 50 yards away when I decided to start running. Not wanting to give my pursuer any warning I just stuffed my phone in my pocket and began sprinting as fast as I could possibly manage. My muscles burned with the strain and my lungs felt as though they were being pierced with needles, but fear motivated me to run faster than any medal or trophy ever could. As I ran, I could hear the crunch of gravel underfoot behind me, no longer trying to match my footsteps, simply moving as fast as possible to reach me.

I almost collided head first with the fence, but somehow managed to get a foothold and start climbing, as though genetic memories of ascending trees in the jungle to escape some predatory beast had been unearthed in order to assure my survival. Within seconds, I was out of the midnight river and standing on the sidewalk, beneath the blazing light of a streetlamp. I fumbled for my pocket knife and opened it, getting into something vaguely resembling a defensive position as I turned to face the one possible place from which my hunter could try to reach me.

And there was, indeed, *something* there, in the dark. A dark figure, just barely discernible at the edge of the streetlamp’s light. It took a slightly hesitant step forward, coming so, so close to being fully visible, but stopped before the light could touch it. I looked up at where I thought its face must be, and I could feel it looking back at me, *studying* me. Then, it simply turned around and began to walk slowly away, back into the blackness, gravel crunching beneath its feet. I could hear it whistling softly as it faded into the shadows.

^(Postscript)

^(As promised; the second document, or “stage” as Trinity refers to it. Once again, the mundane details of Trinity’s life do seem to be accurately reflected within the document. I myself have actually walked with her in the past by what she calls the “midnight river,” though I have only ever done so during daylight.)

^(Thus far, I am unable to determine Trinity’s intentions with writing this narrative. While I wouldn’t necessarily describe her as being entirely mentally healthy, especially given the somewhat traumatic details of her former marriage, she never seemed prone to hallucinations or flights of fancy. And yet, she hardly seems like the sort to write all this out as some sort of hoax.)

^(I hope that the subsequent “stages” shine some light as to what exactly is going on.)
