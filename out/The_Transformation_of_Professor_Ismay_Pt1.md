I've been fascinated with insects for as long as I can remember. When I was a child, I used to collect caterpillars from my yard and keep them in a fish tank in my bedroom. I'd feed them until they grew fat, and when they formed their cocoons, I would sketch them as I eagerly awaited their transformation into butterflies and moths.

Once upon a time, this process would absolutely enthral me. How something so small and meagre could become something so beautiful, was to me at least, one of nature's greatest magic tricks. But now, as I write this from my hospital bed, I have come to understand why God was so selective when deciding which of his creations would perform this great miracle.

In the wrong form, that miracle was nothing short of a blight. A curse. A damnation. 

...and something that I, ashamedly, engaged with, encouraged and observed.

Allow me to explain.

For the sake of my anonymity, I'll refer to myself as John Smith. Also, you should assume that any other name I mention is a pseudonym. It's just safer that way.

I live in the North West of England. I won't say exactly where for you're own safety, (because I know a few of you will go looking after what I tell you) but know that it is a picturesque area of outstanding natural beauty that sees many tourists from all over the country, all year round. There are mountains aplenty, lakes and rivers, vast swathes of woodland and quaint little towns and villages nestled between the many great wrinkles of the land.

Amongst these many towns and villages, you will find large manor houses here and there. They mostly belong to wealthy families who enjoy the peaceful bliss of nature, safely hidden away from the hustle and bustle of larger cities found further south.

After a brief stint in the forces (where I worked as a chef) I decided to focus my efforts towards a career in catering. Those wealthy families? They don't cook for themselves, or rather, they won't. In a city, they would find an abundance of restaurants of nearly every variety that would bend over backwards for the contents of their wallets. In a village, unless they had no issues with eating at the same pub-restaurant every night, they would have to cook their own food, which they didn't do. It was somehow beneath them.

That's where I came in.

I would go from house to house, cooking for and catering to those wealthy families for months at a time. Nearly every day, for almost five years after I left the army. Things were going well. I made a bit of a reputation for myself, and business was consistent. Then, for no reason whatsoever, the work began to dry up. Families that were previously all too keen to have me serve them suddenly stopped calling. I called around, made apologies (though I was unsure what for) and even offered my services at a lower rate, but nothing came through. Nobody wanted me any more. It was as if I had suddenly become a nuisance to these people. (More on that later). I still don't understand it. I was known well enough. My services were always well received, and I'd never had any complaints. I thought for sure it was just a dry spell, that I would see the other side of it, but I was wrong.

It was becoming apparent that working as a rent-a-chef was suddenly not a viable option any more, so I considered a different line of work. I searched job listings online for anything within ten miles or so. I'd work construction, sweep streets... anything at all, just to get some cash flowing. God knows I needed the money. My applications were ignored. Time and time again I was denied interviews and call-backs. I had started to believe that I was cursed.

At that point, I'd gone almost three months without any source of income. My savings were nearly spent, I'd fallen behind on my utility bills, and I hadn't been able to pay my rent for the previous month. My landlord wasn't known for his charitable attitude, and I had run out of time. I wouldn't last another month. I couldn't.

I'd almost given up hope that I would work again.

Then I received a letter in the mail one Monday morning.

It read;

'Dear Mr Smith,

You do not know me, but I know you.

I know that you are a chef and that you are looking for work.

If you would lend my family your services, I will gladly pay you thrice your usual fees.

All I would ask is that you reply promptly, and that you speak of this to no one.

Come before nightfall.

The choice is yours, make it quickly.'

On the back of the letter was an address for a manor house, one I had never heard of before. It wasn't too far, only around nine miles away, though it was off the beaten track a little bit.

If I knew before I started what I know now, I would have stuck with my original plan and looked for work elsewhere. But three times my usual fee? At a time when I needed money the most? There was no way I was going to turn it down.

God, I wish I had.

Day 1

It took two buses to get there. I arrived at the house later that same Monday, somewhere around four. I found the house hiding in the woods, down a gravelled road that led away from the main village road not far from the bus stop. It was a large building, nestled in the trees by a lake. With its towers, terraces and black slate rooves, it was like something from the Addams family, the kind of place that screams generational wealth. I knocked on the heavy wooden door and waited. Soon enough, a little old lady answered the door. She was small, hunched over and softly spoken. Her wrinkled eyes peaked over her dainty golden glasses that sat perched on the ridge of her nose. She shivered in the breeze. In a way, she reminded me of my grandmother.

"Sorry to disturb you, I've come about a job?" I said.

"Very good, Mr Smith, come in." she replied.

And as simple as that, I was through the door. The old lady asked me to wait, and she shuffled off into another room at the rear of the large foyer I found myself in. The house was grand, to say the least. I've never seen so much polished wood and such expensive furnishings, and I've seen the inside of more than a few mansions let me tell you.

After a minute or so, the old lady returned. Alongside her walked another woman, though she was much younger. I'd soon learn that she was the one who'd written to me.

"Mr Smith?" the younger woman said.

I smiled and shook her hand, told her it was a pleasure to meet her.

"My name is Elizabeth Ismay." she said, "I'd like to get right to it if it's all the same to you?"

"Not a problem." I said.

She led me through the foyer and into the kitchen at the rear of the house. Now when I say kitchen, I don't mean that it was one stove, a fridge, a microwave and some counter tops. This was *the* kitchen to rival all kitchens. Imagine any appliance and it was there, except the Ismay's was better. Imagine the biggest kitchen you've ever seen and then double it, then double it again. I'd seen smaller kitchens in Michelin-star restaurants in London.

Elizabeth allowed me to take in my surroundings, and after I'd picked my jaw up from the floor, she spoke again.

"This is where you will work, Mr Smith. Monday to Saturday, ten till seven every day. You have free reign over the kitchen and all its appliances. The menu is already decided and the food will be supplied. All you need to do is prepare it, cook it and serve it."

I didn't want to work that much, but I didn't want to be homeless and jobless either.

"Okay." I managed, "Can I see the menu?"

She motioned with her hand towards one of the counters where a stack of laminated A4 sheets of paper sat. In all honesty, I thought at that moment that it was some kind of joke. Each sheet was filled from top to bottom with meat-only dishes. And I genuinely mean meat-only. Not one vegetable, not a drop of sauce or gravy, no side dishes or sweets or drinks or anything. Just meat, meat and more meat, all the way down.

I glanced up at Elizabeth as she stood silently in the doorway. She was expressionless and still. This was no joke.

"Who am I cooking for?" I asked.

She paused a moment before simply saying, "My father."

"Your father?"

She nodded.

"There will be rules, Mr Smith." she said, beckoning me to follow her.

I left the menus where I found them and stepped after her. It was at this moment I should have left. I was already a little freaked out, and you didn't need to be a chef to understand why this whole 'meat only' menu was bizarre. But again, the money was on my mind. She took me into the foyer and we stood beneath a large portrait painting of an elderly man in a large leather chair. On a polished brass plaque at its base it read 'Professor Bernard Ismay'.

"My father." she said, pointing, "He was the foremost authority of entomology in his prime. He studied at Oxford, and eventually taught there."

I nodded as I glanced up at him. He looked exactly what you would imagine an elderly multi-millionaire looked like. Stern faced, with a grimace of self-superiority.

"I really must insist on your discretion, Mr Smith. Can I rely on you to be discreet?" Elizabeth asked.

I nodded again.

"My father is... unwell, you see." she continued, "For quite some time now, he has been undergoing something of a change."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

She glanced up at the portrait and cleared her throat a little.

"Over time, it seems that he has begun to hate the taste of... well, ordinary food. He won't stand for vegetables or fruits. Will not even consider rice or grains... he desires only... meat. As of late, he has become... difficult to live with."

"Why?" I asked.

"We're not sure." she said, "No one can understand why. He's seen doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists... I have given up wondering if I'm being completely honest. It's better to accept the situation for what it is, we've found."

"What situation? What's going on?" I asked.

"Can I trust you, Mr Smith?"

"Yes." I said.

"Then give me your phone." she said, holding out her hand.

"Why?"

"Does your phone have a camera?" she asked.

I nodded.

"Then please..." she said, holding out her hand.

I hesitated at first, but eventually handed it to her. I knew she wasn't going to rob me. I needed only to look around to understand that she had no interest in a phone worth less than the shoes she wore, and besides, curiosity had taken hold.

"Follow me." she said, "And please be quiet, do not speak unless I say so."

We climbed the stairs together. As I followed behind her, I noticed the little old lady was staring at me from the corner of a doorway behind us. She looked concerned, truth be told. Like a child awaiting punishment from an angry parent in another room. The walls of the stairwell were covered in framed pictures of Professor Ismay as a younger man. He was often in the presence of other academics, standing outside of what I assume was his university. In others, he was in forests and jungles, standing with various native people or holding some sort of insect for the camera to see. A man after my own heart it would seem, though his circumstances were so far beyond anything I'd ever known.

At the top of the stairs was a large wooden panel door with metal hinges that extended across the full width of its face. It was bolted shut at the top and bottom with thick iron bolts, and there was a strange smell coming from within. Elizabeth motioned for me to be quiet. There was a small table to our left with a drawer. Beside that was a metal food trolley on wheels that was covered in scratch marks, as though a pack of dogs had fought across it for scraps. Elizabeth opened the table drawer, pulled out a can of silicone spray lubricant that you might find in an engineers toolbox, and dowsed each of the three hinges with it before slowly unbolting the door.

Movies would have you believe that wooden doors creak when they open, and that it is somehow creepier for doing so. But believe me when I tell you, when a large wooden door the size of a dining table opens in complete silence to a near pitch-black room, there isn't much else scarier in this world. I glanced at Elizabeth and nearly asked her right then and there what the hell was this all about, but I could see there was a fear in her eyes. A deep, almost primal fear of the unknown, like that of a child hiding from monsters beneath their bed. I stayed silent and simply glanced inside as she did.

As my eyes adjusted, I could faintly make out the shape of a bed at the rear of the room. The curtains were drawn, and there was no source of light whatsoever. No lamps, no candles, nothing. There was a cold breeze that rolled out towards us, gripping my ankles and running up my back like the caress of a lover. I found that I was breathing heavier, and my fingers were twitching. The worst part was the smell. As a chef, you get used to the smell of rotten food from time to time. But this was something else. It almost made me cough as it struck me in the back of my throat. I tried to stifle it, but I couldn't. As a small noise escaped my throat, I noticed some movement on the bed.

There was a strange metallic clink, a slight groan, and in the dark of the room, I saw two minuscule white dots appear, reflecting the light from behind us. What I can only assume were eyes, observed me in the doorway before the sound of shuffling began. Before I could do anything else, Elizabeth pulled the door shut and bolted it. Inside, there began a slow thudding sound that grew louder and louder, as though someone was walking our way with slow, laboured footsteps. A drag and a thump. A drag and a thump.

"Is there something wrong with your father?" I asked.

"Let's go, quickly." Elizabeth said.

She handed me my phone back as we descended the stairs. I had no idea what the hell I'd just seen in there, and I had no intention of finding out. Elizabeth saw me to the door, and as I began my polite but firm refusal to accept the job she offered to pay me five times my normal fee.

"Three meals a day." she said, "Monday to Saturday. Simply wheel the food through the door on the trolley, close the door, and wait for my father to finish eating before you retrieve the trolley again."

"Why are you offering me this job?" I asked, "You wrote me a letter saying you know me, but how? And what is wrong with your father?"

I was irate, and made no attempt to hide it.

"Mr Smith, me and my family have been searching for someone like you for a long time. We simply cannot provide the service for my father that I know you are capable of, and your name came my way from a website that matches employers with potential employees. Are you looking for work or not?"

"What is wrong with that man up there?" I asked again.

"That man up there... is my father." she said sternly, "To you, he is Professor Ismay. As I said before, he is very ill, and I did not want us to disturb him. If you're concerned about contagion, then do not be. You will be perfectly safe as long as you follow the rules. Now if it's all the same to you, I would have your answer. Will you cook for my father? or do you have other prospects?"

I thought about it for a moment. What else could I do?

Day 2

I started the next day. After a good night's rest, I was not as unsettled as I had been the day before, though I was not completely comfortable with the situation either. I thought about Professor Ismay on the journey to the house. I thought about the fear in Elizabeth's eyes as we stood in his bedroom doorway. Mostly I thought about the money. I had a tendency to overthink things, and it usually sent my anxiety through the roof. Just cook and serve, is what I told myself. Just cook and serve. I just needed to hold on for something else, something normal, then I would leave and be okay.

When I arrived, It was as she had promised. The kitchen fridges were stocked with meats of all varieties. Some local, some more exotic. Beef, venison, wild boar, kangaroo. There were even a couple of packs of puffin breast meat, shipped straight from Iceland earlier that week.

Elizabeth insisted that my phone be placed in a locker in the corner of the room for the whole day. She said she didn't want anything to potentially disturb her father. I wasn't glued to it or anything so I didn't mind. I did notice that there was a security camera in the top corner of the room. They must have had issues in the past with other chefs, but I didn't ask.

I'm pretty sure that Elizabeth and the little old lady (who it turns out is called Agnes) are the only people who live in that big house, besides Professor Ismay of course. So far, I haven't seen anyone else there at all.

I started at ten, and by twelve I had finished the first section of the first menu. Fried beefsteaks, blue-rare. Roasted chicken breasts and a chunky pork joint. The menu came with instructions on how to serve the meal too. These were arguably more strange than the food itself.

They read:

'The prepared meats will be placed together in the large round metal bowl provided. No utensils or napkins are required, and no seasoning's of any kind are to accompany the food. The bowl is then to be placed in the centre of the metal trolley. After lubricating the door hinges with the silicone spray, the door may be unbolted and opened carefully. The trolley is wheeled no more than ten feet into the room, where the server will then ring a small handheld bell. The server will then leave promptly, taking the bell and locking the door shut behind them. The server will then return to the kitchen for at least an hour and wait for the Professor to finish eating. Do not disturb the professor. Do not speak to the professor. Do not return before one hour. No deviations from the rules under any circumstances.'

Never before have I had to deal with anything like this. It was absurd, but undeniably intriguing.

What I couldn't understand was...well, it was a lot of food. Easily an eight-person meal, and I was supposed to believe that one sick old man was going to eat it all? And it was only the first of three meals that day. I fully expected to be throwing away quite a lot of food.

I was wrong.

I prepared the meats and filled the bowl, then set about carrying it upstairs to the waiting trolley by Professor Ismay's door. On the trolley was the bell. About the size of a cola can, it was a dull silver with a black wooden handle. I placed the bowl on the trolley and pushed it to the door, From the little table drawer I retrieved the silicone spray, and imitating what I'd seen the day before I lubricated the hinges before unbolting the door and pushing it open slowly.

The same cold breeze from the day before took hold of me as the smell entered my nose. It was foul, like rot and human filth. Once again I couldn't see anything inside, it was nearly pitch black. I wheeled the trolley into the room about ten feet or what I thought was ten feet, then gave the bell a quick shake. Ironically. its jingle was quite jolly. Curiosity got the better of me. I walked backwards towards the door, keeping my eyes fixed forward into that dark abyss.

As expected, there was movement in the dark.

Slowly, as if burdened by the weight of his own body, the professor slunk from his bed. His movements sounded wet and heavy. The stench worsened tenfold, as though the professors movement disturbed something deep within that dark room, unleashing a greater torrent of whatever filth befouled the air.

I saw only the faint glow of his eyes as he shuffled my way before I closed the door and bolted it quickly.

Inside, as I pressed my ear to the door, I could hear a clicking sound. Like a Geiger counter, but larger and with a deeper sound. I could hear the faint wet smacking of lips and teeth, and the horrid gurgling, gurgling rumble of the professor's eating.

As I turned, I jumped. Elizabeth stood at the top of the stairs. She motioned angrily for me to follow her, and I did.

I expected to be chastised in some way. I had broken the rules after all, and on my first day too. Instead, she gently asked me to remember the rules and sent me back into the kitchen.

I waited in there for an hour and ten minutes. I'd cleaned everything, prepared as much as I could for the second meal, and after that was done I was just standing there, biding my time. I glanced out of the rear window at the garden. They had rows upon rows of wildflowers. At the back of the garden were around a dozen wooden hives for honeybees. I could see them faintly. Black dots upon the breeze here and there, gathering their nectar. They had it easy.

Upstairs I could hear thumping. Dragging and thumping and the clinking of metal. I turned, and in the doorway to the kitchen was Agnes, glancing over her little glasses at me with a shy smile.

"The Master's finished, my love." she said.

I checked my watch and gave her a slight nod and a smile, and made my way towards the stairway. Before I could pass Agnes, she placed her hand on my arm and stopped me. I noticed her hand was wrapped in bandages. I don't remember if it had been the day before. We locked eyes and she leaned in to whisper:

"Be careful."

I didn't know what to say, other than:

"Okay."

I climbed the stairs and Agnes watched from the doorway to the kitchen until I was out of her sight. I hadn't seen Elizabeth since our earlier encounter, and when I reached the professor's door I felt quite alone.

I pressed my ear to the door. I couldn't hear anything inside. I lubricated the hinges once more and unbolted the door.

I held on to that handle with all my strength. I was fully prepared to pull it shut as fast as I could. As the door opened slowly and the cold caressed my face, I peered into that foul-smelling blackness. I allowed the door to open only a foot or so, just until the trolley was visible. It was as I had left it, as well as the bowl on top. Only, they appeared to be wet. The bowl was empty, so I figured the professor had made quite a considerable mess when he ate. I at least knew where the smell was coming from now. Whatever mental illness this once great academic was suffering from was beyond belief, and it was just now dawning on me how depressing it must have been for his family to see him that way.

I opened the door wider, and as my eyes began to adjust to the darkness within I saw his bed at the rear of the room. There was a large dark patch in the middle. It must have been him. All I could hear was the sound of wet laboured mouth-breathing, and the faint thump of my own heartbeat. I reached in slowly, grasped the trolley and pulled it towards me. The handle was wet, but I wanted out of that room so I didn't care. I stepped back into the hallway, pulled the door shut and bolted it.

I breathed a sigh of relief, before I looked down and nearly vomited in disgust.

The trolley was indeed wet, but in the light of the hallway, I could see that it wasn't from the food.

It was a thick, clear mucus.

Day 3

It took a lot for me to return the next day. After the mucus on the trolley I nearly ran right out of there. Elizabeth caught me at the bottom of the stairs, told me that I did everything adequately. She reassured me that the job would be worth my while, and that any future incidents involving mucus would lead me to be compensated financially, so I agreed to continue.

The second and third meals were much like the first, except I brought some latex gloves with me when I was to retrieve the trolley. Puffin breast and turkey crowns, sausages and de-shelled oysters. By all accounts, it was disgusting to look at. Frankly, I still can't believe the professor was able to eat it all. I figured that most of it was going to waste.

As I stepped off the bus on Tuesday morning, Agnes was waiting by the door for me. She greeted me with a smile and welcomed me in. Elizabeth was nowhere to be seen. I placed my phone inside the locker and started to prep the kitchen. Threw things into ovens, oiled some pans etc.

The first meal of the day was three whole chickens, an entire pork loin, and half a kilo of pickled cockles. For anyone who doesn't know what cockles are, they're like clams the size of your thumbnail. They're perfectly fine in small quantities, but a half kilo absolutely stinks out the whole kitchen, no matter what you do with them.

Whoever is cleaning up after the professor, heaven help them.

I carried the bowl up to the trolley (which had been cleaned before I arrived that morning) and tried not to gag at the sight of the meats sloppily rolling around inside it. I placed the bowl on top of the trolley and pushed it into position. I unbolted the door, and just like I had the day before, pushed it open slowly, making sure my hand was on the handle at all times.

Quietly the door glided into that horrid darkness. I could see the dark shape on the bed again, and hear the wet laboured breathing of the professor within. Suddenly, the door groaned as it came to the end of its swing.

I froze.

I had forgotten to lubricate the hinges.

I didn't know what to do. I saw the professor glance towards me. He moved across the bed, only this time, instead of a slow cumbersome slide he almost sprang to his feet. My heart went cold as our eyes met from across the room. Two beads of white in the darkness were fixed on me, menacingly. I heard the clicking sound from the day before. It was coming from him.

I pushed the trolley inside quickly as he made his approach towards me. I heard the clinking of metal mixed with the drag thump of his steps. The low groan and the clicking and the pounding of my heart, a symphony of horror that I would give anything not to hear. I staggered backwards awkwardly, too afraid to move any quicker, and suddenly felt a tightness in my chest as I was pulled backwards by the collar of my shirt.

It was Agnes. She must have been watching me from the stairs and grabbed me just in time, but not before I caught my first glimpse of the professor in the light of the hallway. I saw only his leg as he stepped into the light, but it was enough to sicken me to my core. His skin was grey and hideously textured like the skin of a toad, with lumps and boils that glistened with an unknown moisture that seemed to cling to him like a film. I gasped as Agnes closed the door and drove the bolts home with a thud.

As we stood outside of his room, I could hear the ravenous old man devouring that bowl of meat with an anger I hadn't heard before. He grunted and snarled as he went, like an animal territorial over its kill. Wet smacking sounds and the crunching of bones emanated from within that dark putrid room as Agnes and I stood together in silence. I glanced down at her, still breathing heavily and not knowing what to say. She had tears in her eyes as she looked at me.

"He was a great man once." she said.

And then she walked away.

I took a walk outside. I needed some air. I checked my phone and my emails, but there was no response to any of the applications I had sent out the night before. I decided to take a longer break than I would normally, just so I could apply for as many jobs as possible. I expanded my search to fifty miles. I didn't care any more. It had only been a few days, but it was enough. The whole situation with the professor was absolutely horrid. He needed help, he did not need me.

I sent a few emails over the course of about fifteen minutes, and then took a short walk amongst the trees. The air smelled of pine needles and the lake. I saw a few squirrels and some birds, and after a while, I was feeling a little better. I decided to head back to the house, and I did so begrudgingly, dawdling as I went. I empathised with the professor's family. Mostly Agnes if I'm being honest. She was clearly shaken by the whole situation, and wasn't in any position to do anything about it.

As I approached the house I glanced upwards towards what I guessed would be the professor's room. It was quite high up, despite being on the first floor. The only room with the curtains fully drawn. Even from the outside, it was clear that the windows were absolutely filthy. As though a fire had been lit within the room, the glass was blackened and smeared with grime. I didn't want to think of what it might be, the thought would likely make me puke.

As I was staring at the window, I noticed one of the curtains was moving. It swayed a little, then became still. Suddenly a hand appeared on the glass, black and wet in the grime. Then another beside it. I couldn't really see, but somehow I knew the professor was staring at me at that moment. Peeking through the filth with both hands pressed to the window, much in the way a child does. Then the curtain twitched again and the hands disappeared back into the dark.

I went back inside and cleaned the kitchen. There was still no sign of Elizabeth and Agnes was pottering around in one of the sitting rooms. Above me, I could hear the drag-thump of Professor Ismay's steps, and occasionally a loud bang, almost as though he was jumping around up there. After a while, it stopped.

The next meal was ten lobster tails, two pounds of beef mince, a whole duck and escargot.

As I left at the end of the day, I glanced back up towards the professor's window. I wondered how he had come to be this way, and how had it began? What could topple a man from the heights of intellectual achievement down to this monstrous existence?

It was then, as I was taking one last look at his window I realised something.

The two hand prints had the thumb on the same side.

Day 4

Before I had left my house that morning, I received a text from Elizabeth. It read:

'Good morning. No need to come in today, I'm afraid my father is unwell. You will still be paid, so don't worry. Return to work tomorrow as normal. Thank you.'

I really did not mind at all. I would have the perfect opportunity to head into the village and try to find another job. I'd take all day doing it too if I had to.

I took the bus and a couple of CVs with me, handing them out here and there. To my surprise, any of the pubs or small cafes I visited seemed to react quite negatively towards me. Some refused my CV altogether. I didn't understand. That was until I ran into a friend of mine, or at least, a former friend of mine. I was just exiting a newsagent when I ran into him. A man called Lionel.

"Long time no see." I said.

"Yeah." he said flatly, "Excuse me."

He tried to get by me, his face almost expressionless, as if he had no time for me at all.

"Lionel?" I said, tapping his arm.

"What?" he snapped back.

"You alright?"

"I'm fine mate. *You* alright?"

There was a hint of anger in his voice this time. Something was going on.

"Lionel, are you mad at me or something?" I asked.

"Are you taking the piss?" he fired back.

A few people on the street were staring now. Lionel looked absolutely livid about something.

"What's going on mate?" I asked.

"What's going on?" he snapped, "You *are* taking the piss. Fuck off you disgusting prick."

And with that, he went inside. I had known Lionel for about two years at that point. He was a chef too, so we knew each other through work. I waited for him outside the newsagent while he shopped inside. Across the street was a small coffee house. Inside, I could see people pointing at me, talking between themselves. The barista was scowling at me. As Lionel stepped back into the street, he groaned when he saw me waiting.

"Lionel!" I said loudly.

He had begun to walk away at speed, but I kept pace with him.

"Lionel! What the fuck is going on?"

Suddenly he spun around. There was a fire in his eyes. I'd never seen him like this before. He looked me up and down as though he was observing something alien and disgusting to him. Then he spat at my feet.

"Kids?" he yelled.

"Kids? What're you talking abo-"

He punched me in the face and I staggered backwards. My nose was bleeding, and when I looked up he was walking away. I never saw him again after that.

I felt unwell the rest of the day. There was a metallic taste in the back of my mouth and I had a headache.

I popped into a small supermarket that I knew had a deli sandwich bar in the back. I had one last CV so I figured I'd try there too. The manager took one look at me and shook his head.

"Why?" I asked bluntly.

"Are you joking?" he replied.

I looked behind me as I heard some commotion and could see someone pointing a security guard in my direction. It was as though the whole world had turned against me, and I didn't know why.

"Why won't you accept my CV?" I asked loudly.

"I've got kids of my own you know. Lots of folk in here do. Those pictures have been going around you know. What chance did you think you have?"

I heard the approach of footsteps. Boots squeaking on the tile floor.

"What have I done? Why won't anyone hire me?" I cried.

A hand grasped my shoulder and a deep voice commanded me to leave with him. As I was pulled away the man behind the bar shook his head and turned away. The security guard (who was not gentle when he pushed me outside) stood in the doorway, blocking me from re-entering.

I could feel tears forming and a lump in the back of my throat as I headed towards the bus station. I reached the stop and it began to rain. Beside me, a bunch of teenagers came to stand beneath the shelter to escape the weather, and when they noticed me they began to chatter amongst themselves, laughing and whispering.

I heard one of them say: "That's him." Another one called me a paedophile.

I walked home in the rain, hiding my face beneath the hood of my coat.

I'll post the rest tomorrow. Just thinking about that day makes me feel unwell.
