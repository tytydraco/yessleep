A couple of years ago my daughter and I moved into a small dingy apartment in one of the worst neighborhoods in the city. It was a two bedroom apartment on the west side of town with a small kitchen nook, smoke stains on the ceiling, no windows ( even though I am certain that is against code ), and a single door that led out to an outdoor corridor. 

We were on the third floor with a nice view of an abandoned Taco Bell that could only be seen during the day and a street lamp that went out half the time. It was a real shit hole to put it as delicately as I can. I never felt comfortable there nor did I feel safe for either of our well beings, but options were not a luxury we had at that time. 

I was a single mom living off of a part time waitress’ salary and not only was her Dad not in the picture, but the deadbeat had up and left us with no notice or contact information. I remember for weeks I would call his cell and just wait and wait listening to the ring until it would go to voicemail. I probably left him hundreds of voicemails, hundreds of text messages. Until one day I called his number and got the automated response telling me that the number had been disconnected. 

At that time Kayla had only been 5 months old. Nearly 5 years later and I was still no closer to finding him. Not that I had been looking. I gave up believing he would ever come back for us and even if he had I wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. For a while I felt bad for my daughter; growing up without her father would be hard enough to understand and process. I worried that it could even affect her future relationships with men which could put her in a similar situation to mine inevitably, but truthfully there was a part of me that was relieved that she would never have to be raised by a man that never wanted her in the first place. That she would never grow up with a single memory of the man that abandoned her mother while their baby cried all night with colic. No, we were all each other had which was both isolating and yet comforting.

Each night before bed we would follow our typical routine. I would make dinner as Kayla played or colored her coloring books. After dinner I would run her a bath and wash away her day. Then we would watch a half hour of cartoons on the old living room tv. Most nights she would fall asleep on the couch and I would end up carrying her to her bed, tucking her in and kissing her head good night right before I would leave closing her door. 

For as shitty as my job at the time was, and it was shitty, the one good thing it had going for it was that I never had to work on Saturdays. This was bittersweet for me seeing that Saturdays were our busiest day of the week so the lack of income wasn't great, but that also meant I got to spend my Saturdays with Kayla. This also meant that Friday nights were my opportunity to relax. Honestly, it was really my only night in the week where I could relax. So, after Kayla would go to bed I would sneak out the door and smoke a joint in the empty corridor as the cool night breeze blew across the hall. Sometimes I’d even hear a pack of dogs howling at the moon. 

Many of you reading this may judge me for getting high while my little girl was sleeping; not exactly the responsible decision I recognize that, but it was the only time I could find for myself and it helped me relax after every stressful week. It also had the added benefit of helping me forget the bills that were piling up on my kitchen counter, the credit card notices that went unpaid and were now compounding interest, and the sinking realization that my daughter may one day find herself doomed to live the same life that I was living and some nights that thought alone was too much for me to bear. So I had decided that Friday nights after Kayla was asleep I would light one up and try to spend that night as blissfully as I was afforded to.

After I was done with my smoke I would then sneak back inside and lock the series of locks on our only door. If my memory serves correctly there were five of them. When we first moved in there was only one. It was the lock on the actual door knob which the knob itself was in desperate need of replacing. Seeing that we lived in the worst part of town I nagged my landlord to install a few more. He pushed back against this idea at first, but with my daughter’s safety at the forefront of my mind I continued to pester him until finally he relented. 

He refused to install any additional locks himself, but he told me that if I wanted to go out and purchase some and install them myself I was more than welcome to. So, that day I went out and bought four new ones. One was a chain lock which was practically worthless but it made me feel a little bit better. I also installed two additional in door deadbolts near the door handle itself and finally a sliding deadbolt at the very top of the door. The sliding bolt at the top was to prevent my daughter from leaving the apartment on her own, not that she had ever done that before, but I was not about to take any chances.

All in all it wasn't much but it was home for us for the time being. Not long after I had installed the locks is when the unspeakable began to take place right in our little part of town. Kids started to go missing in the night. Vanishing into the darkness never to be heard from again. The first to go missing was a little boy named Thomas Wilson who was seemingly snatched out of his bedroom through the window. I remember seeing his mom on the news talking to police and bursting into tears as they took her statement. His Dad had been a bit more composed, but all his strength seemed to be focused on keeping his wife off the ground.

Then a little girl named Becca Gonzalez who, based on what little information they had, had walked out of her front door in the middle of the night when she heard her cat Snowball scratching at her bedroom window. She had even left the front door open as if she were anticipating to only be outside for a moment or two, but she never came back. Her parents found the door still open that following morning. Snowball curled up on the couch under her favorite blanket as snow blew into their living room. After the police had shown up they took a look all around the outside house, but all they found left of her was one of her fuzzy bunny slippers face down in the snow.

For a while the police weren’t sure if these cases were related, but seeing that a kid was going missing nearly every other week in our area it became harder and harder to deny the facts: Someone was taking these kids. Eye witnesses never saw anyone abducting them though, but some did claim to see a similar vehicle at the crime scene the same night that the children were taken. An old brown Dodge Avenger with rust on the wheel wells. 

One lucky father claimed that in the early hours of the morning while he was getting ready for work he heard someone turning the doorknob of the front door as if testing it to see if it was unlocked. After hearing this he called out to whoever was on the other side of the door and from the window the father could see a figure darting back to that exact vehicle previously described and driving away in the night. Beyond that there were no other leads.

Obviously this utterly terrified me and I sat down with Kayla on multiple occasions to warn her of the danger of talking to strangers. Warning her to never ever leave the house without me by her side and she always agreed with me. I never told her the full details of what was going on. I mean how do you even explain this kind of evil to a child, but I think in the end she saw the fear and desperation in my face. One night, in an attempt to calm my nerves, she drew me a picture of us holding hands together on the beach, a dream we both had shared and talked about many times before. As silly as that sounded, it did make me feel better and I ended up framing it in the cheapest CVS frame I could find and put it on my night stand.

One week had been particularly rough for me. Work had forced me to work double overtime due to people calling in sick, and although I needed the money, the added stress was unwelcomed. I had to basically use up the entirety of that excess overtime pay just to cover the additional costs of daycare for the week. On top of that my car seemed to be on its very last leg which threw me into a full blown panic attack seeing that I had less than $200 to my name and that was before it was even time to get groceries. So, needless to say, It had shaped up to be a really awful week. So by the time Friday had finally rolled around I was beyond ready to blow off some steam. 

I got off work a little after six o’clock after having pulled a double shift at the diner. I said good night to my manager Manny then made it to my car and prayed the engine would start. When it finally did I shifted into drive and slowly made my way to the daycare to pick up Kayla, the entire way hoping and praying that I could just make it home as the engine sputtered. 

Thankfully that old piece of junk had gotten me all the way there. I picked up my daughter who greeted me with a big hug and a handful of “I love you”s which made my bad day just a little better. For all my failings as a parent, for all the things I could not give her, I was thankful that I could at least afford to give her peace of mind. She never once fully understood how bad of a situation we were in. She lived in blissful ignorance during those times and seemed to be genuinely happy. Sometimes understanding this was all that got me through those very bad days.

I collected her stuff and a few more pictures she had colored and said goodbye to the woman that ran the day care as Kayla hugged her good bye and said she was excited to see her again next week. We climbed into my car and made our way home.

We got home a quarter past seven and after walking into the apartment I followed my routine procedure of locking every lock on the door. I had always found the lack of windows in that apartment creepy, but honestly with everything going on in the news including the kidnappings it was starting to comfort me. Yes, there was very little natural light, but there were also very few ways for someone to break in.

Kayla spent the next half hour reading, watching cartoons, and doodling while I made dinner. It was my specialty: mac n’ cheese which was without a doubt her absolute favorite. We sat down together on the couch and ate dinner and talked a little about our day, or at least as much as one can discuss their day with a five year old. 

After dinner I gave her a bath and she pretended she was a deep sea diver looking for treasure. She even went as far as to make a bubble beard and growled “ARRRGGGGG!!!” which made us both break into laughter. I dried her, dressed her in her PJs, then we laid down together on the living room couch and watched another half hour of cartoons as her eyelids became heavy and she started to drift to sleep. Then one of those cheesy pharmaceutical commercials came on the TV. The kind that shows adults living their best lives as the commercial goes on telling you about all the horrible side effects, but in this commercial there was an old married couple holding hands and walking down the beach together. I thought Kayla was already asleep, but then she broke the silence.

“Mommy?” 

“Yea?”

“When can we go to the beach and see the dolphins?”

“Not for a little while sweetheart” I said knowing full well I was a lifetime away from affording anything remotely close to that.

“I’m going to bring my notebook! I’ll write down every fish and take their pictures too!”

“That sounds like a wonderful idea, love.” I said tucking a few strands of wild hairs back behind her ear.

In the end she collapsed with her head on my lap drooling into sweats and I smiled. I shut off the TV and gently lifted her off the couch and moved her to her bed. I tucked her into her fresh sheets, slipped her favorite stuffed animal Socko up against her chest, and kissed her forehead good night as I shut the door behind me.

It wasn't even 9pm by that time so I decided to get some stuff done around the apartment. I popped on my headphones and listened to a podcast as I cleaned the dishes, put away a mountain of laundry, and simply tidied up around the apartment. By the time I was done it was nearly 10:30 PM. My entire body was plagued with exhaustion and I was very tempted to drop everything and just go straight to bed, but in the end I decided against it. 

Ever since the kidnappings had started I had made a rule for myself. I would not leave the apartment for any reason past nine o’clock for our own safety which also meant that for the past few weeks I had not had the luxury of my Friday night smoke which by that time had definitely started to take an affect on my already declining mental health. I had even started making my way to my room when I saw the stack of unpaid bills that had now piled up and spilled over the kitchen counter. It may sound stupid in hindsight, but that was the catalyst for the chain reaction of events that have led me to putting this all down to paper. One smoke was all I really needed. Had I not earned that much? Besides, I told myself, I will just stay right next to the door and if anything happens I will throw myself inside and lock it immediately. For a few short moments a part of myself had even tried to talk me out of it, but it was no use. I had made up my mind. 

I went to the kitchen and retrieved the little tin box from above the microwave where I stored my weed and rolling paper. I rolled a quick joint and retrieved a lighter from the mess of our junk drawer and made my way to the door. Stopping for a moment I peeped out the little brass peephole and saw nothing immediately outside my door. I could even see the street lamp just down the street which that night did me the honor of actually being illuminated. After a long moment I carefully unlocked the locks, one by one, and made my way out into the hall trying to make as little noise as possible.

The hallway was as quiet and empty as it always was at this hour. Nothing to break the silence except for the sound of a police siren wailing in the distance and the rustle of the wind carrying away pieces of litter. I sparked up my joint and inhaled it slowly; blowing away the smoke every few moments as I began scrolling through Facebook. I don't really remember how long I stood out there, but it was definitely longer than I had originally anticipated as by the time I went back inside I was already really feeling it. If this was a real horror movie I would be telling you about how I heard a noise, saw a figure, fought for my life, and barely escaped, but truthfully none of that happened. For all my worries it was just another night. 

I came back inside and packed up my tin box with what was left of my weed and paper and put it back above the microwave. I walked through the house turning off every light I had left on and as I passed Kayla’s door I peered in and saw her sleeping in bed with her blankets rolled so tightly around herself she looked like a burrito. I remember that it made me chuckle. I made my way to my room which was at the very end of the hall and I collapsed into my bed. I breathed a sigh of relief as I felt my body growing heavier and heavier. Every worry in my mind faded as I drifted off to sleep.

A few hours later I woke up in a daze. The effects of the drugs had worn off by then and I sat up alone in my bedroom entirely devoid of light. I checked my phone and the screen read 2:30 AM. I shut off my phone and laid back down to try and fall back asleep, but just as I was dozing off to sleep a single thought filled my mind and sent shivers straight down my spine twisting my guts into a knot. “Had I made sure to lock the door?”. I replayed my moments before bed over and over in my mind: I put Kayla to bed, I cleaned the apartment, I went out to the hall for a smoke, I came back inside, I put my stuff away, I checked on Kayla, I went to bed. Over and over I played it back and every time I did I realized I could not remember if I had locked the door and the more and more I thought of it the more and more I was certain I had not. 

In my panicked mind every sound I heard was the worst case scenario. Every creak of the foundation was an intruder waiting to harm us. Every shadow was a nightmare come to life. I sat there petrified for what felt like hours unsure if I even had the courage to actually get up and check the door. Had it not been for Kayla in the other room I probably never would have gotten up, but slowly I did. 

I pulled on my robe and carefully made my way down the dark hallway feeling my way through with my hand along the wall. I shuffled my way past Kayla’s room and back down the long hallway. I could feel our framed photos hanging from the wall then I felt the light switch against my finger tips. At first I had planned to flip on the lights, but after a moment I decided against it. Part of me was concerned that the light from the hall would wake Kayla up, but another realer part of myself was more afraid to do so as if illuminating the house would accomplish nothing more than exposing myself to the monsters that lurked in the shadows. Logically it didn’t make any sense, but in the end I decided against it. I stumbled into the living room, nearly tripping over an end table, then used the kitchen counter to guide me the rest of the way to the door.

I approached it slowly, hoping that I was just being paranoid and over-thinking this whole thing, but as my eyes adjusted to the darkness I could see what I had already known to be true. Every single lock on the door was unlocked. Even the chain lock hung from the door swaying back and forth. My blood froze in my veins. I threw myself to the door as if this final act of speed would stop whatever impending danger we had been subjected to these last few hours. I moved my trembling hands to the locks slowly locked each one finishing with the child proof deadbolt at the very top of the door. 

When I finished I stood there a moment with my heart drowning my ears with its rhythmic beat when another more terrifying thought burst to life in my mind: I never stopped to check on Kayla. Maybe it had been due to my half asleep brain, but she should have been the very first thing I checked. How could I have been so foolish?

In that moment I felt a wave of panic and courage pour into me as I ran bolted down the hallway leaving the living room behind me. I slowed just long enough for my hand to swipe at the light switch flipping on all the lights in the hall. I grabbed a hold of the door knob to her door and burst into her room nearly heaving…

There I found her still laying in her bed fast asleep wrapped in her Winnie the pooh blanket. Her little stuffed monkey stared back at me with its deep black button eyes. I exhaled every thought I had in relief, all the dread and panic draining from my body like a tub draining away its water. Somehow in all my commotion I hadn’t woken her. I slipped back out of her room as quietly as I could and closed her door. I was beyond lucky I hadn't woken her, otherwise I would have spent the rest of the night with a five year old asking me to play tea party while I should have been sleeping. I remember thinking “Thankfully she had always been a heavy sleeper”.

I took two baby steps back to the light switch and killed the lights then felt my way back to my bedroom and collapsed again into my mattress. I checked my phone one last time as 2:57 AM flashed back at me. I locked my phone and laid my head back down onto my pillow. This could have been bad I thought, really bad. I had to be more careful. No more late night tokes. I don't care how badly I need it. I finally closed my eyes and drifted back to sleep.

I woke up the next morning at 8:30 AM and laid in bed for another half hour scrolling through my phone. My best friend from high school had announced her engagement on Facebook and I congratulated her in the comments even though part of me hated her for being happy. Finally, I stood up, threw on some sweats and headed to the kitchen.

I entered my little kitchen nook and started the stove and proceeded to make some eggs from the last of the carton. I played some music off Youtube on my phone and sat it on the counter as I opened the fridge to pull out our jug of apple juice then went back to flip my eggs. Turning back to the microwave clock I saw it was 9:06 AM. I decided I would let Kayla sleep in for another 10 minutes then would wake her to some eggs and toast.

I slid my eggs onto a plate and filled a cup of apple juice then made my way across the room from the kitchen to the couch passing by the apartment door when I saw something out of the corner of my eye that stopped me dead in my tracks. I felt an overwhelming chill run through my body as if I was being thrown into a pool of ice cold water. I took a step back, then another and turned to look at the door. I dropped everything I was holding. I barely even heard the plate shatter against the floor. The door stood there still closed, but every single lock was unlocked. Even the child safety deadlock that Kayla could not reach.

I immediately turned and ran in heaving sobs back to her room as fast as I could. My feet slamming into the floor. My heart was racing so fast I thought it would burst free from my chest. I felt all the color draining from me. Sweat freezing cold running down my spine. It wasn't possible… I know I locked it, I told myself… I swear I know I locked it... Oh god I know I locked the fucking door! I threw my whole body into Kayla’s door not holding back a single pound of myself and the door gave in, tossing me into the room. I stood there eyes wide for not even a second before I screamed. I screamed so loud that the world all around me went deaf. There before me was Kayla’s bed empty with no trace of her. Her blanket now cascaded onto the floor and all that was left was of her was her little sock monkey laying on her pillow staring back at me with its black button eyes.

\---

It’s been four years since she was taken. Even after reporting her missing to the police it took them nearly three months to accept that she wasn't just another runaway even though they knew some monster had been out there snatching children from their homes. She wasn't even the last to go missing that year. Three more kids in the following months went missing under similar situations and then, seemingly out of nowhere, the disappearances just stopped. No clues, no letters, no sightings, nothing at all. 

I spent a lot of time in therapy after that night. Sometimes it was to cope with what had happened and sometimes it was court ordered after a series of suicide attempts. For a while I just tried to move on, I tried to just live my life for her, but for anyone that has ever experienced the avalanche of dread and hopelessness that losing a child invokes in you, you know that it is impossible to move on. The feeling of failure knowing your one job in the whole world was to protect them, to keep them safe, to make sure their every need is met and you failed in the most unfathomable of fashions. 

They never found any of the bodies of the kids. Never found a shred of evidence that any of  them met foul play, but deep down in my soul I know that she is gone... Or maybe that’s just what I tell myself because I am too afraid to think of what it would mean if she was still out there. What life she was living with an attacker that swept her away in the night. Away from Mommy. Away from her bed. Away from what little comfort and safety she was afforded in her short life. 

I am sitting alone in an even shittier apartment writing all this down because my therapist says it will be good for me to get what is stuck in my head out onto paper. She says it can help kickstart the healing process and allow me to come to terms with what happened to me; with what happened to Kayla, but deep down I know it won’t help. 

I replay the entirety of that night in my mind every moment of every day. I think of the things I shouldn’t have done. More so than that I think of the things I should have. I blame myself for it all. My friends, my family, my therapist, even my support group tell me I shouldn’t. They tell me the only one to blame in all of this was the monster that took her from me, but I know I am to blame for it all. I really don’t sleep much these days between the anti-depressants and the nightmares. I try to drown them out with images of Kayla. Of her smile. The way she would stick her tongue out the side of her mouth whenever she was thinking too hard. I try to focus on the images of the beaches she never got to go to. The beaches I promised I’d one day take her to, but that never seems to work either. It never works because each time I close my eyes in my most private moments I see them there before me: Five locks. All hanging open.
