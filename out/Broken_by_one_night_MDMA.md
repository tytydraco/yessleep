This story is literally r/nosleep.

It’s wild journey into the toll of insomnia, and a cautionary tale (not to fear-monger) about a rare but devastating risk from mixing MDMA and cocaine I had no clue was even possible.

On January 12th, my happy, healthy 43-year-old life was turned upside down by one Friday night in a way that had bigger consequences for me than anything else to ever happen. It broke me in a way that I barely survived, even now, 10 months later.

Some will see this as a case study at the intersection of medicine, drugs, and brain science. Others, a harrowing dive into extremes of the human condition.

As the one who lived it, it’s been quite a ride.

Here’s the story…

At my brother’s 50th birthday in Cabo, Mexico — along with other party guests, I was offered cocaine as part of the festivities. By no means a user, I’m also not a novice. I consider my profile “normal” in that I’ve never looked, so to speak, but am also open-minded and not afraid to try something passed to me by friends.

For context, I am a responsible and educated guy with a bunch of advanced degrees. I manage a small but thriving international company. This background is not to brag, only to establish that until January I lived a drama-free life, successful and healthy by any metric. I’m also by nature an understated middle child, so making noise or having weird stuff happen to me is not my thing. Until that night, I’d found a way to coast through life under the radar, without anything big ever going wrong.

Being in my early 40s, my partying days have been over for a while, and January was probably my first time in a decade — since business school — touching party drugs.

Over several hours at a place called Bagatelle, where the first dinner of the three-day birthday bash took place, I had a dozen+ lines/bumps of coke while sipping champagne. It was a festive, if over-the-top, scene as our group of 40 danced atop the long birthday table, stepping over dinner plates, while magnums of dom perignon carried between waiters were poured directly into mouths like parishioners taking communion. Not your typical Friday night, but we were all having fun celebrating my bro. So chemically speaking, cocaine and alcohol were the first things in my system.

Then sometime before midnight, I was handed by a banker friend of my brother’s in the crowd what I was told was MDMA brought from San Francisco. I’d taken molly twice before in my life — once at a wedding in Prague, and before that at a club in Aruba — and had positive experiences both times. I didn’t particularly want to take it that night in Mexico, being so late already and feeling tired from flying out of DC at the crack of dawn… so I nearly said, “no, thanks.”

But your brother only turns 50 once, and I didn’t overthink it. I split the cap in half with my fingers, swallowed what I figured would be a “light” dose, and kept on with the party.

Biggest mistake of my life. Across all years. The one that changed everything. No one could have guessed what lay ahead.

When added to the cocaine and alcohol in my bloodstream, the MDMA instantly had an intensely negative effect. In my two previous experiences with molly, I hadn’t mixed it with any other drug. But this time was different. I felt an overwhelming anxiety never previously known in my life.

An hour into that state, I had to leave the afterparty. I was consumed with unease and couldn’t continue to talk to people. When I got back to my room at Esperanza, I wasn’t able to sleep. This wasn't unexpected since cocaine can make the process of settling down belabored, and I'd had a lot even by Gary Busey standards. I lay in bed, up for the rest of the night, eventually passing out after 6 am.

That afternoon when I awoke, the panic and anxiety hadn’t gone away. I stayed in bed, skipping day two of the birthday bash, drifting in and out of naps, always with the same psychological malaise. The non-situational anxiety that started the night before was an entirely new feeling to me. I’d never had a mood disorder or taken a psych med in my life.

The next day came and went with me still in bed, continuing to feel the same strange physical anxiety without any thought attached. My phone filled with photos of the continuing party as I skipped most of the third and final day of the 72-hour weekend celebration.

And that’s when the real problem started…

On the third night, when I tried to sleep, no sleep came.

Day four, Jan 16, I flew to Mexico City for routine work meetings and events. The same thing continued that night — and the one after — no sleep.

By the end of the sixth sleepless night, having barely scraped through what would have otherwise been stress-free work obligations in CDMX, I flew home to DC and assumed all would return to normal in my bed.

Nothing changed back home.

A seventh virtually sleepless night became an eighth with an hour or two of broken rest, springing wide awake with the same strange churning anxiety. It was as if my mind had gotten stuck in “fight or flight” mode.

Now, in my prior life, a restless night — say, from a red-eye flight, before a big speech, or a tough board meeting — would lead to sheer exhaustion the next evening and me crashing hard, catching up from the lack of rest. But that “catch-up” sleep never came with this bizarre MDMA insomnia. I simply did not get sleepy, no matter how many nights passed.

After two weeks, I knew in my gut something was seriously wrong. After consulting my family doctor, I contacted a psychiatrist for the first time, who began to treat me with introductory sleeping pills, starting with trazodone. These didn’t put a dent in my insomnia, and I was rotated to stronger categories of prescription.

I proceeded like this for the next month, working with a growing team of doctors, psychiatrists, and sleep neurologists, who wrote me scripts for sequentially more heavily controlled meds. These trials included EVERY sedative under the sun, on and off-label. I won’t re-list them out by name, suffice to say, I left no stone unturned. Just the “categories” alone of sleep-related drugs I cycled through with my doctors, trying to find one that worked, included orexin inhibitors, adrenergic receptor agonists, benzodiazepines, z-drugs, conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, atypical antidepressants, melatonin modulators, gabapentinoids, and, eventually, full-on anesthetics — a la Michael Jackson. I had every bloodwork panel done, a sleep study (sleeping 50 minutes across the night), an MRI and EEG, hired a CBT coach, etc… none of this helped or provided doctors insight into what had happened in my brain.

By the three-month mark, I’d trialed 40+ on-label and off-label sleep drugs. Here it’s important to clarify something about how psych meds are used by doctors. When prescribed “on-label” for mood disorders like depression, anxiety, bipolar, and so on, these drugs require weeks, even months, to work. But when prescribed “off-label” for sleep, they either work or don’t on the first night — providing diminishing returns over time. For this reason, and to avoid dependence, many doctors advise rapidly rotating sleep drugs. This is how I was able under doctor supervision to trial every sleep RX in existence over the first 90 days, hoping to find one that worked.

New “designer” drugs like the DORAs had to be specially ordered by the pharmacy. I was becoming so desperate to sleep, that for one called Quviviq (which had treated Matthew Perry’s insomnia), and insurance wouldn’t cover, I shelled out $1000 for a month's supply not knowing if it would help…. it didn’t.

Against these sleepless nights, I tried to wear down my mind by spending every day working out in the gym and running miles outside. My goal became to tire myself to sleep, and I was like a warrior fighting this battle. I got into the best shape of my life as a result, but it didn’t change anything. People’s passing compliments couldn’t imagine the source of my transformation.

Piece by piece, I also removed as many potential stressors from my world as I could think of — in the hope that putting one of these on the back burner might fix things. So, fighting my heart in a tug of war, I pushed all passion from my personal life into the background — shutting out love.

At work, I’d been doing what I could to keep on top of running a company, masking my increasingly exhausted appearance and debilitated mental state — reminiscent of [Edward Norton’s workplace struggle with insomnia](https://youtu.be/8pDY_9u5Sn0?feature=shared) in Fight Club. Anyone who saw me in those days will know that the giveaway of this scene being fiction is Norton’s eyes aren’t nearly sunken enough, as mine had become by then.

On days when I just couldn’t function, I couched my absence as “migraines” among colleagues and friends — too embarrassed to say I wasn’t sleeping, something that comes naturally to everyone, including me for 42 years prior. On top of this embarrassment, I was ashamed by the source of my plight being a frivolous party drug — an admission I didn't broadcast beyond doctors. So I gutted it out in silence.

But the mental and physical toll eventually became unsustainable, and I had to start an indefinite leave of absence from the job I loved. I cut out all travel and personal commitments. I canceled trips, reassigned roles, and appointed surrogates. Yet, nothing I did to streamline my life changed the sleeplessness. I never yawned. Never got tired. And all I could ever manage was an hour or two of heavily medicated sleep — holding out hope with each passing week that a new prescription cocktail might finally bring restorative rest.

After three months, I’d invested $10,000 in the best neurologists in a 3-hour radius of me, most of whom don’t take insurance. But I was still no closer to finding a solution, let alone a basic understanding of what medically I was facing. I reduced my daily routine to the calmest activities, clean food, textbook sleep hygiene, zen-den bedroom, etc. But no matter what I did to LuLuLemonify my life, I couldn’t sleep. It was a hell you can’t imagine, without relief — not for one night.

By mid-April (Month 4), encouraged by my doctors and the few closest people I’d let into my struggle, I took the next step and checked myself into a series of private clinics and hospital residencies in the hope of treating this mysterious condition in-patient with 24-hour care.

To put this in perspective, during my past two decades at work, I might have taken one sick day every 3 years. So flying to a clinic was out of character for me, let alone having to take weeks, eventually months, off work.

In late April and early May, I travelled to Texas and checked into one of the top behavioral health facilities in the country. It’s the kind of private hospital oasis that takes away your phone on arrival, so nothing can distract getting well. While in-patient, I was placed on a different kind of medication, an SSRI, with no obvious relationship to sleep. It was given to me to treat the anxiety increasingly surrounding me in this saga, as I shut my life down. Lexapro, a serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, works purely on the neurotransmitter 5-HT — just like MDMA.

Miraculously, and unexpectedly for doctors, Lexapro finally put me to sleep. For the first two weeks that I took it, my life was back to normal like I’d overcome this curse. I flew home with enormous gratitude, ready to restart my life with more passion than ever. I jumped into work and rebuilt personal connections I’d so missed. After what I’d been through, it felt like I’d been handed a lifeline that’s impossible to describe unless your life’s been ripped from you. I was beaming and energized, having conquered my battle. While it baffled doctors that Lexapro put me to sleep, no one second-guessed the positive results. After all, Lexapro targets the same monoamine as MDMA, Serotonin — a concrete clue as to what had gone wrong that January night.

I felt like I’d beaten by far the scariest thing I’d ever faced, and for two weeks, Lexapro was my sword in battle. But then, in a cruel twist of fate still hard for me to look back on now, as I adjusted to its SSRI effects, the insomnia came right back to what it had been. I stuck with the Lexapro trial in the hope it was just a transient side-effect, but by week 7, the insomnia was worse than ever. I tried other serotonin modulators like Trintellix, but nothing put me back to sleep. The honeymoon of Lexapro became a bittersweet memory of restorative rest that disappeared as unexpectedly as it arrived.

A few weeks later, in June, I was finally able to see the chief sleep neurologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, Christopher Earley, who I’d been trying to get in with for months but is booked a year in advance as the national authority on sleep science and the brain. A family friend on the Hopkins board helped get me up the list.

On hearing my story, after examining the details of my chart, and consulting with his colleague at Hopkins, neurologist [George Ricaurte](https://karger.com/nps/article-abstract/42/1/5/232593/3-4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-Ecstasy-Induced?redirectedFrom=fulltext) — a well-known researcher on methamphetamine and MDMA neurotoxicity since the 90s — Dr. Earley told me what I’d taken in Mexico caused a “one in a million” reaction in my brain. I’m not a doctor so take this layman’s translation with a grain of salt: When combined with the volatile punch of dopamine from all the cocaine, MDMA caused a Serotonin Syndrome that fried my receptors and transmitters through a rare but devastating neurotoxic reaction. Serotonin (5-HT) controls sleep in a way that requires a delicate balance to get right. When damaged by chemical forces, it can throw everything out of whack. This is why a few days of insomnia, anxiety, and malaise after molly is common — just not usually long-lasting, much less, permanent. For most people, damaged 5-HT proteins restore quickly; but in rare cases, lasting, even irreversible neural death can occur. Dr. Earley told me I wasn’t the first he’d seen this happen to. He also referred to cases in the medical literature about a range of neurological disorders from one-time MDMA use. (I also later learned that SSRIs immunize to MDMA’s effects, but only if you’re already taking them at the time of administration).

While certain as to the source of my insomnia-from-hell, Dr. Earley couldn’t tell me if I’d ever get better and if my neural would someday system regenerate. Lexapro offering a two-week solution clued the structure of the original damage, but he couldn’t explain why it stopped working. Not knowing if anything would ever work again (with candor I appreciated), and seeing the exhaustion in my eyes, Dr. Earley agreed to treat my case on “an experimental basis” and ordered a new weeklong sleep study for more data. Becoming the experimental patient to one of America’s most seasoned doctors felt at once affirming, given the extremes I’d been through, and terrifying, for what it signaled about the road ahead.

June gave way to July and the 6-month anniversary of my insomnia was fast approaching. As this dreary milestone neared, I became increasingly isolated and was losing hope. I hadn’t been to work in months, had retreated from my private life, my mental health had crumbled, and I’d lost precious parts of my world that meant everything to me. More than $200,000 had been spent going to the top doctors in the world (including The Retreat, a boutique full-service clinic outside of Baltimore that runs $50k per 20 days and accepts no insurance). Whatever it took to get me better had been invested, knowing that my future was increasingly on the line. But despite seeking out the best of the best, no one could get me to sleep, tell me how long this hell would last, or if it would ever go away.

We’d also run out of new medications to try, the last one being the narcoleptic drug Xyrem (aka GHB, the date-rape elixir used at [Diddy’s parties](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/sean-diddy-combs-baby-oil-was-allegedly-laced-with-date-rape-drug/4002710/?amp=1)) — an anesthetic prescribed to me by Dr. Earley as an extreme last resort. Being highly controlled (only one pharmacy in the US is authorized to dispense it), Xyrem was taking forever to get approved, as it costs $25,000 per month and requires passing through a bunch of safety hoops.

Sleep deprivation is a form of torture considered to be among the worst. It makes you go crazy and not think straight. We’ve all experienced in our lives the relentless feeling that comes after a single sleepless night. In as little as four days, sleep deprivation breaks prisoners of war into giving up classified secrets. So by the time July rolled around and my unending insomnia hit the 6-month mark, I’d been broken so badly I was starting to become suicidal — no closer to finding rest.

Compounding this was a Catch-22. It’s paradoxical, but the most effective sedative-hypnotics prescribed by doctors for life-saving rest, also come with “black box” warnings in their fine print about triggering severe depression and suicidality. So my hopelessness about sleep was being chemically amped up by the very medications I was taking to try to help it. My mood had become trapped in a “damned if you do,” “damned if you don’t” equation, with no way out of the choice between depression from not sleeping, or depression from sleeping pills…. (This “impossible problem” reminded me of a quagmire facing SpaceX at the time, [which had somehow gotten legally stuck](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring) between the no-way-out choice of being fined for hiring non-residents in breach of US rocketry law, or, being fined for not hiring non-residents in breach of US workplace law.)

The snowballing downward spiral I've described is how — coming from a guy who’d in December 2023 been the happiest and most energized in my life, with an awesome company I was expanding, cherished waterfront in Canada and on the Chesapeake I’d spent years developing for the rest of my life, a place in the city, financial security, supportive mentors and colleagues surrounding me, a dream job that took me to all corners of the earth, in short, all I ever wanted and more — by the time July 2024 came around, the person I’d become was not recognizable as the same me. It was two different lives. Because I couldn’t sleep… I couldn’t think, I couldn’t engage, I couldn’t feel pleasure. I was a zombie who hadn’t slept more than a few hours a night since January. It was pure hell – far worse than anything I could have imagined would ever happen to anyone I knew, least of all, to me.

So for an eternal optimist who’d never really felt down for any stretch in my life, much less considered the idea of suicide in my wildest dreams, even as something I’d understand in other people who were suffering (never once able to grasp what could bring someone to THAT state of mind)… by July, suicidal ideation had become my everyday struggle.

It’s sometimes said that self-harm is selfish. I thought that way too. But through the unending attrition, what eventually felt most selfish to me was continuing to drag everyone through my endless ordeal. A clean break would free us all from the black hole.

What I’m about to share may seem weak, but know that I’m virtually unbreakable. No one builds what I did in life without limitless resolve, nor could anyone survive the parts of this story still to come without iron will.

But the laws of nature are fact. Absolutely no one — no matter how resilient, no matter how brave — can fight biology forever and win. Sleep exists for a reason. We cannot be without it. There is no alternative.

So after spending the sleepless night of July 4th watching fireworks on the Baltimore skyline from my room at The Retreat — remembering my old life watching fireworks the year before on the Tred Avon River among friends and family, now a distant memory of a past life when all was well… two mornings later I finally gave up my last hope of ever getting better. I had the sinking feeling of a kamikaze pilot called for his final mission, summoned for one last test of courage. The universe had left only one way to end the endless insomnia, and give myself with certainty the rest I’d been desperately seeking for so long…

Pushing back tears, I scribbled a short goodbye note, remembered one final time the life and people I’d been so in love with before this all started, cursed God for cursing me… and tried to kill myself.

I’ve always flown under the radar, never seeking attention. So doing the unthinkable was not a masked plea for help, like those who choose pills or cuts, and rarely succeed by design. That wasn’t me for a minute. Instead, I’m a quick study and my method represented a firm decision. I made a strong noose and secured it at such a height that nothing could allow me to turn back once the process started, knowing there would be — I had no idea how long — intense pain before blacking out. But I told myself it couldn’t feel worse than what I’d already been through. So I bit my lip, prepared for that moment, and the eternal unknown to follow.

Without going into graphic details, against every probable outcome, I partially failed, or partially succeeded — depending on the measuring stick. You could call it the first piece of good luck I’d had in six months, coming at a crucial time.

On the other hand, what I did forever changed my relationship to the life I once had and always wanted, the people around me, and what follows. I’m still here, but not in a way that feels like me — with brain trauma far beyond chemicals now that can’t be undone by any medicine, no matter how far and wide I search for a cure this time around. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. What I’ve been through is unimaginable and unending.

They say the higher you climb, the harder you fall. The happy, go-lucky person I was in December appears in my mind as a character from a distant movie that I look back to and miss. Every moment radiates out of the past. Through the foggy delirium of time between then and now, it feels like both a curse and a miracle that I’m here. Either way, January 12 will always mark in some way the last day of my life.

What happened to me from one night of MDMA undoubtedly ranks among the most severe, adverse, and life-changing reactions of all time. I know my story is the exception to the rule, not the rule. I know that.

But I also know I’m not alone… I’m not the only one.

This platform is full of testimonials from terrified people experiencing lasting insomnia after even a single MDMA use. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/s/l88p1xECmC) is one among many, here’s [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/s/R77cNigJ0y), all variations on the same theme. Most of these testimonies get shot down by the vast majority of others who’ve only had positive experiences with Molly and instinctively doubt that the same drug could do so much damage to someone else. Trust me, you can’t truly understand this risk until it happens to you. But through my journey, I’ve discovered so many lives broken by MDMA. I get why accounts like mine are downplayed by those who never experienced the dark side. Like you, I never thought it would be me.

If you look up medical case reports in NIH literature, you will find countless examples of permanent [anxiety disorders](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5968564/) and intractable [psychosis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3304680/) brought on by single doses of MDMA in people with no prior mental health history — as was the case with me.

If you dig into community blogs and research what is called the “long-term comedown” (LTC) phenomenon, there are so many heartbreaking accounts where one night of MDMA created psychological and physical consequences lasting months, years, and sometimes forever.

What happened to me is exceedingly rare… as Dr. Earley at Hopkins Neurology said, my case may represent a “1 in a million” neurotoxic reaction.

But if I had had any idea I was playing the lottery with my life that night, even at one in a billion odds, even at one in a trillion, I would have never taken the cap handed to me. I loved my life too much to risk it. What hit my brain, transformed it in a way that slowly took away the best parts of me. I can’t make sense of why it happened. I will never find meaning. It’s just crushing.

I’ll also never know and always wonder what incredible things were waiting just around the corner in my life if only I’d dropped the pill when it was in my hand. It’s too much to think about now… I made the wrong choice and it’s done. I can’t explain fate. I wasn’t perfect by any stretch, but I didn’t deserve this. No one does.

For 999,999 people out there this reaction will never occur, and, since the chances are slim, you’ll likely not see this story as serious. I would have thought the same before it happened to me. Before that night, I never worried. I didn’t know the first thing about medicine, the brain, or how drugs work. I never went on Reddit, never stressed about health. I was living a charmed life and got lucky at every turn. Everything just worked and was good. I was living it. That was me and many of you. I hope all of you. I’m jealous you’re still in that world  — the one I had for 43 amazing years.

But for that next 1 in a million person out there, I hope my story gives pause before putting chemicals into your brain that can change how it works — reshaping your life in ways you can’t imagine, and the lives of those on the journey with you. It’s just not worth the chance. Life is too precious to gamble toying with this complex supercomputer we call the mind. The brain is our universe and when you live in it, it feels like that universe will always be yours — the same as it always was. Just as “the sun always rises,” we carry the Illusion that our mental world is constant, stable, and permanent. I certainly did before that night. But the truth is we don’t understand how the brain works, let alone what can throw off its axis, rotation, and balance for good. So why risk it? I wish I never had this story to tell. I would give up everything to go back in time and drop that cap when it was still in my hand. It’s a “what-if” moment I’ve replayed as a reel in my mind ten thousand times — what feels like every hour, sometimes every minute. I can’t change the past now, but maybe sharing this story makes my journey useful to someone else’s future.

Wishing peace and love,

Mark

—Epilogue—

People asked about the suicide attempt. How I survived...

It’s a horrific second act, with a few miracles I’m told.

Since this is not a sub about psychological torture, I didn’t go too far into the next chapter of my saga since July. But because it’s part of the ripple effect from that January night, and although it includes shameful details, I’ve been astounded by other people’s sincere stories on here as I’ve navigated all this…

So here’s “Part Two” —

At the end of my third week at The Retreat outside of Baltimore, in early July, with the best doctors in the country still no closer to helping me than anyone had been at the start of my journey six months before, I gave up all hope of getting better… and hung myself.

During the days leading up — despite sharing with my assigned therapists a growing belief that my end was drawing near, alongside petrified family members calling twice that week to warn doctors of the despair in my voice and what they feared was coming — naively, the nurses had loaned me a 14-foot charger cable.

In some nearby woods, I tied the cable to a sturdy branch on an overturned log above a stream, doubled it twice around my neck, and slid my body off the edge. I’ve always been drawn to water, and dying in suspension above a trickling creek felt like the most peaceful place on campus I could think of to say goodbye to the world. I passed out almost instantly as the noose caught, cinched, and fastened tight. Sometime later — no one knows how long — one of the cords snapped, then the other, and I fell.

Two sudden bursts of orange flooded my head in flashes of the most intense pain I’ve ever known as consciousness returned. My eyes popped open, and I jolted back to life — like something from a movie. But the right side of my body was entirely numb, I had twitching fingers, double vision, pulsating pupils, uncontrollable shivering, and a bunch of other weird thermodynamic effects from starving my brain of oxygen long enough to shut it down. This was all later diagnosed as an anoxic brain injury to my left hemisphere.

When alert enough to walk, I stumbled back to The Retreat in that asphyxiated state and turned myself in. I was taken by escort to the emergency room at Geater Baltimore Medical Center, and remained there in a delirium, coping with the terrifying new effects of the brain injury I’d just suffered, compounded by months of insomnia that broke me down in the first place. Nothing, it seemed — not even hanging myself — would let me escape. I was trapped in an episode of Black Mirror or The Twilight Zone.

Then, in a twist of dark humor from the universe (that made even Dr. Earley laugh out loud when he later heard), I became sleepy in the hospital for the first time in 6 months. Somehow, shutting my brain down seemed to reset it in a way that brought back intense fatigue — which none of the 40+ medications I’d tried had been able to do. So I dozed in and out of consciousness for three days in the hospital, as MRIs, echocardiograms, and other tests were done to see if the asphyxiation had caused a stroke or a heart attack.

For reasons that remain unclear, despite the nature of the self-inflicted wound that brought me in, I was being kept on the hospital’s stroke floor with minimal security — rather than its protective psych floor. And so that’s how, shortly before I was medically cleared to be transferred by gurney to a trauma unit next door, on the afternoon of July 9, still in an anoxic delirium, I ran from the sitter watching me, when distracted, to the 6th-floor exit just down the hall from my room. Without pause, I dove head-first down the hospital’s stairwell center, figuring a six-story fall would end the suffering once and for all.

But security chased and caught my foot just as I went over the edge, hanging on for a split second, long enough before I slipped through their hands, that I flipped as I free-fell down the stairwell center — colliding with, and bouncing off, railings on the way down, which zig-zagged my vertical trajectory obliquely enough that I ended up hitting on a landing 3 floors below, instead of traveling all 6 stories. Had anything about the fall been different, I wouldn’t be here. It all felt like a dream.

Against every odd, even going three floors headfirst didn’t kill me — as it did fellow musical soul Liam Payne last week in Argentina. But when the back of my head hit the concrete landing, it deviated my eyes in a way that now makes 3D vision hard (called r/strabismus), and gave me a condition known as “Acquired r/Aphantasia,” which means losing your mind’s eye. So when I close my eyes now, I can’t see anything in my imagination, can’t picture what anyone looks like, can’t recall visual scenes from my past, can’t envision the future, am not able to absorb written words without saying them, can’t navigate without GPS, and many other ways that losing your imagination reshapes you. It feels like losing half of your mind, the visual half. I’ve been told my whole life I’m a “visual person,” so losing this motor feels like losing my essence somehow.

In more dark humor from fate, this new neurological condition is also exceedingly rare — just like the strange insomnia before it. Acquired Aphantasia is uncommon among brain trauma victims because rear-occipital and parietal-lobe damage happens far less frequently than frontal-lobe, as with sports injuries and head-on MVAs (car crashes). So I’m navigating this new chapter, figuratively and literally, “in the dark.” It may last forever. No one knows.

When you add it all up, what’s happened since January is so crazy it couldn’t be fiction. Only real life. It’s too unbelievable. And now the sleepless nights that started it all feel like the beginning of a much longer chapter I’m still waking up to (…pun not intended).

After my fall, I was locked away for 40 days in a ward — much of that time on “1:1,” which is like solitary confinement, but with a dedicated guard standing at arm's length 24/7… even in the shower, even in bed. Still in a trance from my head colliding with concrete, I thought about Moses in the desert. I began to talk to my guard, this alter ego beside me, like the Voice in the Burning Bush. Her name was Sam.

When I was strong enough to walk, I walked in circles. Endlessly. Sam's voice beside me brought periodic news of the outside, beyond the walls… an assassin shot Trump at a rally, but the bullet grazed his ear… a giant bridge across the Chesapeake collapsed nearby, cars dropping into the water as stones into a pond. My world — inside and out — had become magical realism, like a Hundred Years of Solitude. Fiction had turned into fact in this Borgesian labyrinth.

Given my apparent penchant for transforming seemingly benign settings into deathtraps, ward leadership was terrified of a lawsuit. So that meant all eyes on me, day and night, a never-ending watch. My life was paper scrubs, paper spoons, rubber mattress, plastic pillow, no sheets, metal toilet, no lid, Stockholm shower, no curtain. Strip searches at sunup and sundown. The pattern repeated, day after day after day. I felt like Hannibal Lecter, just without the Goldberg Variations to keep me company.

I did my time, and after six weeks was eventually released in mid-August. Since then, I’ve survived by planting and cutting trees on some acreage I own, and long adventures with my dog [Peanut](https://www.instagram.com/theotterholt/) — trying to keep at bay what has become depression on a level I never knew existed in this world. Worn down by what’s become ten months of insomnia, and now navigating strange deficits of new brain trauma — I keep thinking back to my peaceful life before this all started, and the dreams I left behind along the way as my world caved in. I can’t understand why any of it happened, and on top of it all, I’m not able to sleep much, still...

Most recently, I’ve spent September, October, and November fighting poison with poison — doing every brain-reset protocol known to man, including five weeks of Ketamine infusions, seven weeks of [TMS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32830052/) (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), four [Stellate Ganglion Block](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10029323/) neck injections (used by the military for PTSD), and starting soon, triweekly ECT (ElectroConvulsive shock) under general anesthesia. But none of it makes a difference. My mind feels blank. My heartlight’s out. There are no more stars in the night sky. I’m just gone tbh, beyond words, medicine, or therapy.

I’ve never been a fan of melodrama, but have the inescapable feeling I missed life’s chance — derailing onto the wrong track from one random night out, and now my train is headed in another direction. After being the driver of my life, I’ve become a passenger, seeing where each day goes. I don’t know how this ride in my new brain shapes up. It’s a different motor. Fortunately, I can still write, but I’ve lost the ability to be succinct (as you may have gathered) from Aphantasia because I now have to say everything in my internal monologue, I can’t just look at words to know them anymore. I need to hear them. It’s part of this sea change.

Some who know me asked…

Did the medical system fail me? No.

No, in that MDMA put the writing on the wall. That was my choice, and while it's on its way toward legalization in a bunch of countries like the US, Mexico is not one of them. Ironically, that same morning, Jan 12, Mexican customs seized on arrival some CBD lip balm in my toiletry bag — a stocking-stuffer I’d received on my birthday three days before, purchased over-the-counter in DC. So there is no global consensus on what is safe and what is not.

No, in that I was treated by countless compassionate doctors who did the best they could. Dr. Earley stands out because of his plain-spoken honesty, but he is not alone. There were too many superb docs to name (Yurewics, Fayed, Israel, Hale, Dyer, Rosenthal, Singh, Foster... the list goes on).

Most importantly, No, in that there is not a neurobiologist on earth who understands the human brain. We simply have not reached a point of anything more than presumption at best. So how can any doctor be faulted for not finding my silver bullet?

On the other hand…

Did the medical system fail me? Yes.

Yes, in that — believe it or not — MDMA (3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine) was first synthesized by Merck Pharmaceuticals, owner of so many of the same patented drugs I would later take to fight its damage. You break it, you buy it.

Yes, in that the very sedative-hypnotics prescribed to give me life-preserving sleep also gave me life-destroying depression.

Yes, in that the 14-foot cable I used was loaned to me by nurses in a top-notch private medical clinic who knew I was fast becoming suicidal.

Yes, in that I turned myself in to a hospital in an anoxic delirium from hanging, only to be assigned a room beside an unlocked 6th-floor exit stairwell — when an entire secure floor existed in the same building to protect patients in volatile states.

My story seems worth telling if for no other reason than the questions that intersect here across medicine, policy, pharma, and brain science.

But none of these questions matter to me now. I wasn’t thinking about any of them as I sat on that log, rolling back the reel of time.

I was remembering the people and places I love.

My story’s told. The question is how to move on.

I was always loyal to my company and grateful for the people I shared it with. They’ve been loyal all these months — flying the plane, awaiting a return, never giving up hope. I’m told I need a haircut (starting to resemble Fabio), but the re-ignition process has begun. I’m blessed to have them in my life, and so much more.

The last thing left to face is my heart. It’s been sealed since I shut it down in May, burying memories that still haunt me. Coming up on the anniversary of the night that started it all, I can’t help but think back to this time last year — healthy and strong, sleeping soundly, no chemicals in my body, my dreams in order, embarking on what I thought was to become the best chapter of my life. I’d always heard, “From the brightest day comes the darkest night.” Now I know it’s true.

I’ve learned that pure sleep and true love have much in common. They arrive when you’re not looking. They fill you with dreams. Their melody is a nocturne. And when you lose them, you lose everything.

This Christmas, every carol echoes a bittersweet reminder of those last few weeks of shining eyes one year ago, before this saga began. I’ll never get those shining eyes back. Or get why they slipped away.

Here’s hoping ECT erases all the memories — like Jim Carey in [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://youtu.be/yE-f1alkq9I). I always liked that film, never imagining his quest would someday become my own. Meet me in Montauk.
