I used to always go to Yellowstone every September when I was 10 years old. It felt like that place was one of the most peaceful-looking biomes of land out there. Of course, the trips that were paid for were rather expensive at the time, but every trip we made there was always worth it.

I became old enough to live near Yellowstone when my parents allowed me to move out of the house. During my stay near Yellowstone, I had a job as a receptionist, which during my time there was well-paid. I almost never spent a penny of the money I had because I wanted to buy myself a big house.

Of course, I had a lot of people there talk with me, and some even made jokes while I got them set up for their rooms. There wasn't really anything else for me to do, honestly. So why am I posting this if there's nothing out of the ordinary going on?

Well, this one particular night at Yellowstone scared the living hell out of me. I was traveling through the lands of Yellowstone, admiring the plant life and animals there. However, over the time of sunset, the animals, like the elk or foxes, were starting to run away from whatever predator chased them.

I was starting to think a bear might be attacking them, even though I don't think bears can exist at all in Yellowstone. It was around midnight when I was packing my things up and calling it a day when I heard a wolf's howl in the distance. I got startled a little bit, but wolves do appear in Yellowstone often, so at first I didn't pay it any mind.

However, things only got worse when I heard an animal ruffling the bushes beside me. I could only assume the worst: that a bear might jump out and attack me for whatever reason. But what I saw made my heart drop to my stomach, and I could feel myself sweating like a pig in the cold night.

It was a wolf that popped out of the bushes, but it wasn't like any wolf I've ever seen. The wolf had jet black fur with a dark grayish muzzle. Its eyes are hollow and black, with no pupils or iris. Its most frightening trait, however, is the long, slightly curved teeth that form a demented canine smile

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I watched the wolf tiptoe down to the dirt pathway where I parked my truck, as if it were sneaking up on someone or some animal, except the wolf had its soulless eyes and shark-like grin focused solely on me.

The wolf sat down on the dirt pathway about 10 feet away from me. I was sweating buckets just from watching this thing. I continued to pack my things but made sure to keep my eyes on the wolf; it didn't move. However, as soon as I looked away and put my last suitcase in my truck, I turned back to see the wolf standing 3 feet in front of me, wagging its tail as if I were his owner or something.

I gasped in horror, but made sure to hold back my screaming. I know for a fact that I looked away for no more than 5 seconds. So it was clear this wolf moved very quickly. I couldn't get over how terrifying this wolf was.

Normally, wolves are timid and docile canine animals that often run away from humans. But this wolf looks like it wouldn't feel a thing no matter what it killed, whether it was a human, an animal, or even a higher predator. I knew I had to leave the land eventually, so I did something that was incredibly stupid.

I held up my phone and took a picture of the wolf. The bright flash of light caused the wolf to whimper and sprint away. I waited for a full minute to see if the wolf would come back, but as soon as I believed I was safe and got into my truck, I saw the wolf sprinting at me. I immediately hit the pedal and drove away from the wolf as it damn near pounced on my truck.

As soon as I got to the lobby building, I sprinted down to it, not taking any chances if that wolf somehow followed me. As soon as I got into the lobby, I was breathing so heavily that my co-workers and my manager asked me if something was wrong. I showed them the picture of the Smiling Wolf, and they were terrified of what I had just seen.

The only thing I could do was explain what happened when I was traveling through Yellowstone. My manager told me the wolf I saw must've been a new breed that no one had ever seen before and complimented my luck for surviving such an encounter. She told me if I ever saw a wolf like that again, I must let her know immediately.

I stayed near Yellowstone for a week after that, and I never saw the Smiling Wolf again. There's something about that damned wolf that haunts me still. It didn't look normal in the slightest. It looked completely and utterly demonic.

***And that is a very scary thing to see...***
