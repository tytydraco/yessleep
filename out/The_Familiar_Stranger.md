The steam from my coffee mug twisted in the air between us, a serpentine shape that momentarily obscured Adam's face. When it cleared, he was still smiling, that same smile I'd known for fifteen years. We'd been roommates in college, best men at each other's weddings, godparents to each other's children. The kind of friendship that survives time, distance, and life changes.

"So anyway," Adam continued, stirring his own coffee absently, "Melissa thinks we should consider moving out of the city. Maybe find something in the suburbs with more space for the kids."

I nodded, only half-listening as I gazed out my kitchen window at the pale November morning. A light snowfall had begun, the first of the season. Adam had shown up unannounced at my door just after dawn. Not entirely unusual for him, especially since his separation from Melissa six months ago. He'd been staying at a rental across town, and these impromptu visits had become more frequent.

"What do you think, James?" he asked, tapping his spoon against the ceramic mug. Tap-tap-tap. A rhythm that suddenly felt too precise, too measured.

I turned back to him. "Sorry, about the suburbs? I thought you and Melissa were..." I trailed off, confused. Hadn't he just spent the last three visits lamenting the end of his marriage?

Adam's smile remained fixed. "Right, right. Old habits." He waved his hand dismissively. "I meant for myself. A fresh start."

Something fluttered in my chest. A momentary discomfort I couldn't place. I'd known Adam since we were eighteen. I knew all his expressions, his mannerisms, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he was genuinely amused. But sitting across from me now, in the soft morning light of my kitchen, something felt... off.

"You okay?" I asked. "You seem different today."

His smile widened a fraction. "Different how?"

I couldn't articulate it. It was Adam. The same shaggy brown hair with premature gray at the temples. The same blue eyes. The same small scar above his left eyebrow from a skateboarding accident in our sophomore year. But something wasn't right.

"I don't know. Tired, maybe?" I offered.

He nodded too quickly. "Haven't been sleeping well. You know how it is."

As he lifted his mug to his lips, I noticed his hands. Adam had always bitten his nails. A nervous habit since childhood, he'd told me. But the fingers gripping the mug were perfectly manicured, the nails uniform and clean.

"Did you finally kick the nail-biting habit?" I asked casually, though my heart had begun to beat faster.

Adam glanced down at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. A fraction of a second too long before he answered. "Yeah. Melissa always hated it. Figured it was time."

I nodded, watching him more carefully now. The way he held himself seemed different too. Adam had always been a sloucher, much to the chagrin of his chiropractor. But the man sitting across from me now had perfect posture, spine straight as a rod.

"How are the kids taking the separation?" I asked, testing him.

Adam and Melissa didn't have children. They'd tried for years, suffered through two miscarriages, and eventually decided they were okay being just the two of them. It was a sensitive subject, one we rarely discussed.

"They're resilient," Adam replied without hesitation. "Kids adapt quickly to these things."

The flutter in my chest became a cold, hard knot. I set my coffee down slowly, careful to keep my expression neutral. Whoever or whatever was sitting across from me wasn't Adam.

"Right," I said, forcing a smile. "More coffee?"

The thing wearing Adam's face nodded. As I stood to grab the pot, I caught a glimpse of its reflection in the glass cabinet door. For just an instant, so brief I might have imagined it, the reflection didn't match the person sitting at my table. The proportions were wrong, the head too large, the shoulders too angular.

I poured the coffee with a hand that wanted to tremble. My mind raced. Adam had a key to my house. He'd always had one. Had he come in during the night? Or had this... replacement... somehow taken the key from him? And where was the real Adam now?

"Thanks," not-Adam said as I set the pot down. "So, how's work been? Still dealing with that difficult client?"

I didn't have any difficult clients at the moment. In fact, I'd just told Adam last week about how smoothly my architectural projects were going.

"Oh, you know," I said vaguely. "Some days are better than others."

Not-Adam nodded as if this made perfect sense. "That's life, isn't it?"

As we talked, I noticed more discrepancies. Adam had always had a nervous habit of running his hand through his hair. This version of him sat perfectly still. Adam laughed from deep in his belly; this thing had a carefully measured chuckle that never reached its eyes. Adam knew that I took my coffee black; this impostor didn't comment when I added cream and sugar to my refill.

"Have you heard from your sister lately?" I asked, knowing that Adam was an only child.

"She's good," the thing replied smoothly. "Starting a new job next month."

I felt sick. My pulse thudded in my ears. How long had this been going on? Was this the first time, or had this thing been visiting me before, perfecting its imitation? How many conversations had I had with this stranger, believing it was my oldest friend?

And then I saw it. As not-Adam smiled at something I'd said, I noticed its teeth. Adam had slightly crooked lower teeth. He'd always refused braces as a teenager and joked about it well into adulthood. But the teeth I glimpsed now were perfect. Too perfect. And just for a moment, as it smiled wider, I could swear there were too many of them, crowded together like a shark's mouth.

The thing must have noticed my expression change because it quickly closed its mouth, the smile becoming tight-lipped.

"Everything okay?" it asked, head tilting at an angle that was just slightly wrong, as if its neck had an extra joint.

"Fine," I said quickly. Too quickly. I needed it to leave. I needed to find out what had happened to the real Adam. But I couldn't let it know that I'd noticed.

I glanced at my watch, feigning surprise. "Shit, is that the time? I have a client meeting I completely forgot about."

Not-Adam's expression didn't change for a beat too long before registering disappointment. "On a Saturday?"

Was it Saturday? I'd lost track of the days since my divorce, working from home, one day bleeding into the next. But yes, I was fairly certain it was Saturday.

"Yeah," I lied. "This client's flying out tomorrow, so it was the only time that worked. Renovating an entire office building, big commission." I stood up, hoping I appeared apologetic rather than terrified. "Rain check?"

Not-Adam stood too, its movements too fluid, too graceful for Adam's usually clumsy frame. "Of course. No problem at all."

It picked up its coat. Adam's coat, the worn brown leather jacket I'd helped him pick out years ago. And slipped it on. I walked it to the door, maintaining what I hoped was a normal distance. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to put as much space between us as possible.

At the door, not-Adam turned to me with that too-perfect smile. "Let's catch up again soon. Maybe grab a beer at McGinty's? Like old times."

McGinty's had closed three years ago. Adam and I had mourned its loss over the last beers ever served there.

"Sounds great," I managed.

As I closed the door behind it, I caught one last glimpse of its face. For just a moment, the features seemed to shift and slide, as if whatever was beneath the Adam-mask was adjusting its fit.

I locked the door. Deadbolt, chain, the works. And immediately grabbed my phone. My hands shook so badly I could barely navigate to Adam's number. It rang once, twice, three times, then went to voicemail.

"Hey, it's Adam. Leave a message or text me. Whatever works."

His voice. His real voice, with that slight rasp, the casual tone I knew so well. I hung up without leaving a message and tried again. Straight to voicemail this time.

I sank down onto my sofa, the phone clutched in my hand. What had just happened? What had been sitting at my kitchen table, drinking coffee and wearing my best friend's face?
