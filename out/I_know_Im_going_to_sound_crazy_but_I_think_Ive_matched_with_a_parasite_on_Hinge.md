Please read this properly. I am not spiralling. I am trying to work out when I lost control of something. If anyone can offer any help, I’d really appreciate it because…well, I don’t know what the fuck to do.

A week ago, which feels almost like a century, my mum was on the phone, telling me I was twenty-five and “running out of time.” She said marriage does not happen by accident. My dad took the phone and said he just wanted me settled. I told them I was fine and kept scrolling through Hinge while they talked.

I have loved someone properly before. It did not improve my judgement, so I do not treat it as a goal anymore. I date when I am bored. I stop when I am not. My life works. Well, worked.

While my mum was still speaking, a message came through.

Long time no see.

I assumed it was someone I had forgotten. That happens. I opened his profile. His face made my stomach tighten. I could not place him. I typed a question mark.

Are you okay? he wrote. You do not usually do this.

I scrolled up.

There was a long conversation already there. Months of it. Messages written in my voice, with my spelling, the blunt tone. References to places I go regularly. Jokes I would only make when I was relaxed. No man has ever seen me that relaxed. Naturally, I was confused.

We were together for a while, he wrote. You do remember that, surely.

I told him he had the wrong person.

You said that last time.

I stopped replying. I went to work. I did not think about him until I realised I was checking my surroundings more often than usual, like my body was expecting an interruption. A shadow where there should be none. A figure glimpsed and gone. I thought maybe it was just in my head and tried to shrug it off.

Trying proved useless. For weeks, I kept seeing him where he could plausibly be. Across the street. On a platform. In a crowd I could not quite focus on. Every time, he was gone before I could be sure. I even looked through an old journal and there was an entry about him? I have no recollection of ever meeting this man, let alone taking couples pics in a photo-booth to stick in my journal? My mind screamed tricks, illusions, paranoia? I needed proof. I arranged a date. I wanted to prove nothing was wrong. I felt silly and paranoid. I’m also ashamed to say that I heard my parents in my head, telling me not to close myself off.

This is where things got kinda creepy. He knew where I liked to sit. He moved things toward me without looking at them. He remembered my entire order. He remembered I like hot sauce on practically any meal I eat.

Some wine and a few hours later, I was genuinely having a great time. Mentally, I prepared for a second date. Near the end, he reached across the table. I thought he was coming in to kiss me. I don’t kiss on the first date, so I prepared my “let’s take it slow” monologue.

He took my wrist instead.

He pressed his thumb into a specific point, gently, like he was finding something. The room flattened. My hand went limp. I could not feel my fingers. My chest tightened so fast I thought I might pass out. Copper. I smelled copper. My mouth was bleeding where I had bitten down.

He leaned in again and said, quietly, that this was the place I usually gave in.

I stood. The chair toppled. People stared. He stayed seated. Watching. Patient. Waiting?

I do not remember leaving.

I remember standing in my flat with my shoes still on. My arm ached deep in the joint, like something had been adjusted. What the fuck?

I called my best friend.

She asked if I was safe. She said this keeps happening. She said every few months I end up back with him, confused and irritated with myself. She said everyone thinks he is a creepy piece of shit. She said she believes me.

She told me to block him. She stayed on the phone while I tried.

The app froze. When it refreshed, the conversation was still there.

I decided to call my mum.

My mum listened carefully. Then she laughed softly. She said she remembered him. She said he had always been attentive. My dad agreed. He said I had seemed happier back then.

My mum said he was coming for dinner on Sunday. She said it would be rude to cancel, though I pleaded anyway. I was unsuccessful.

Since that call, I keep having the same feeling. Like something has settled into a space in me that I stopped using without noticing. Like it has learned the shape of my life. I feel drained completely, bleak and hopeless.

It is Sunday now.

I am sitting in my childhood bedroom. My parents are downstairs. I can hear them talking in that careful, polite voice they use when there’s an important guest over. This means so much to them it pains me. I really don’t know what to do. But I can hear steady pacing outside my room. Shoes scraping, it feels deliberate. My chest tightens. My walls feel smaller. My heart is loud. I know it’s him. Is he some sort of parasite? A demon? A memory made real? What is going on? I don’t have much time left, so I’ll update when I can.
