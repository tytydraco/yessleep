I picked up a book from a donation bin behind the library. It didn't have a title, author, or even a barcode. Just a cracked spine and pages that looked...wrong. 

I brought it home because I thought it was interesting. But I was wrong.

I should've never opened it. 

It lay half-buried in a library donation bin, wedged between a torn cookbook and a water-damaged Bible—no barcode. no label. no price. 

Only one story was inside. The words weren’t printed. They were *written*—slanted, frantic, as if the writer felt a hot breath on the back of their neck. 

I flipped to the last page. Blank. 

Until it wasn’t. 

A single line began to form in front of me, stroke by stroke: 

*“The Boy Who Ate the Ending.”* 

I should have shut the cover right then. But I didn’t. I kept reading. 

 

Scrawled in the gutter between paragraphs—different ink, shaking letters: 

*“Three days. Finish your own ending.* 

*If you don’t, he finishes you.”* 

I kept telling myself I’d start tomorrow. Then the next day. Then the next. 

*I never wrote a single word.* 



The days dragged like wet paper. Every glance at the book made my stomach knot. 

*It can’t be real.* 

I repeated it—almighty mantra of denial—until the words lost meaning, and the silence began to hum. 

*By the time I finally believed, my ending was already chosen.* 



Tonight, I woke up needing to pee. Nothing strange. Just one of those small, stupid things that pulls you out of sleep. 

I checked the clock as I passed the hallway. 

 *11:55 p.m.* 

The bathroom was quiet. Everything was still. 

But when I came back—*He was there.* 

Just standing. 

Middle of the floor. Like he’d been waiting all night. 

He looked… *normal.* 

No glowing eyes. No shadow tricks. 

Just a kid. Barefoot. Baggy shirt. Messy hair, as if he’d rolled out of someone else’s nightmare. 

But his smile—that smile didn’t belong on any kid I’ve ever met. 

It was *patient*. And *starving.* 

He studied me like an unfinished sentence. 

*“Are you gonna make me wait?”* 

My tongue stuck to my teeth. 

*“The last one who did…”* 

A too-long tongue licked dry lips. 

*”…became dinner. He was so warm.”* 

 

Instinct took over. 

Drawers yanked open. 

Pens—dry. 

Pencils—broken. 

Except one. Half-used. Barely sharp. 

I slammed the book on the desk, flipped to the final page, and scratched frantic lines—anything that might count as an ending. 

*“Mm…”*

 His voice was suddenly beside my ear—as if the air itself carried him. 

*“I bet you’d be warm too.”* 

The pencil dragged— 

*Snap.* 

Then—*ding.* 

*Midnight.*  

He giggled. 

Soft. Delighted. 

*“I was hoping I could eat you.”* 



He didn’t lunge. 

He didn’t grow claws or snarl or scream. 

 

He just leaned in. 

Slow. Deliberate. 

Like he’d been waiting for this. 

*Like I was dessert.* 

 

Then his mouth opened—*wider than it should have.* 

The stretch was silent. 

Unbroken. 

Wrong. 

*Rows of jagged teeth glistened in the dark.* 

Not made for chewing. 

Made for removal. 

*Crunch.* 

The pain didn’t come all at once. 

It peeled in— 

slow, creeping— 

but once it started, it was *excruciating.*

First the bite. Then the tear. Then the pressure where things used to fit. 

*Bone under molars. Soft tissue splitting. My body forgetting how to be mine.* 

At first, I didn’t feel anything. Just heat. Tightness. Then— 

*Crack.* 

*Tear.* 

*Snap.* 

Something soft gave way. 

Pain shot through me like a current. It lit up every nerve. I thought I might pass out right there. 

*But he wouldn’t let me.* 

My body folded like a half-read book. 

*Crack.* 

And then— 

I felt fingers where there shouldn’t be any—turning me open. 

Not just through me—*into* me. 

It felt like my very being was being ripped apart. The pain was so sharp it blurred everything else. 

I wasn’t even sure I was still whole. Or if I ever had been. 

He rifled my ribs like he was skimming pages, flipped organs like paragraphs, rewrote marrow with hungry ease. 

All I could think about was how much I wanted it to *stop*. 

But I couldn’t beg. I couldn’t speak. I could only cry—*quiet, helpless tears for every second I remained conscious.* 

Tears for the pain. Tears for the fear. Tears for whatever part of me was still left to *feel* it. 

*He ate around my heartbeat last.* 

I'm writing this because I don't know how much longer I'll be able to. 

The book is still here. 

The page is filling again.

I think he's coming back for what's left of me.
