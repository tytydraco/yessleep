Ugly girls are ghosts. I was a ghost who haunted my father’s house.



His house was small and blue and built on a hill. It looked like a dead thing. Being inside it made me feel dead, too.



I only felt alive in dreams. I loved dreams, not because I felt alive but because that’s where I had power.



I had power in *my* dreams, of course. I used my power to leave my father’s dead blue house and go to the lively red house at the bottom of the hill.



For years I dreamed of that red house. Of its vivid paint, bright windows, smiling mother and easygoing father with their giggling daughters and dark-haired son.



I wanted them so all badly.



I didn't have them, so instead I gave them to myself in my dreams.



I had power in my dreams, like I said. But I had power in other people’s dreams, too.



I like to make my dreams beautiful. I like to make other people’s dreams nightmares. The first dream I ever turned into a nightmare was my mother’s. I made myself a monster and sat on her chest and scratched her eyes until she woke up screaming.



After my father started doing what he did, I turned his dreams to nightmares, too. I gave him nightmares of powerlessness. It was my favorite thing for a while, until I figured out he took his dream-powerlessness out on real-life me.



I stopped giving him nightmares after that.



I gave other people nightmares instead. People I knew, of course, like neighbors, teachers, classmates who never even looked at me. But people I didn’t know, too. People I never knew. 

People I’ll never know.



I loved dreams because they gave me control. Dreams made me happy. Dreams were all I had. 

Dreams are all I ever got.



That was my father’s greatest complaint, you know:



*This is all I’ll ever get.*



My father, with his sad eyes and fluttering fingers.



He always raged about how his dead blue house and backbreaking job and slinking wife and ugly daughter and sullen sons were all he ever got.



*All I’ll ever get, and I never even wanted it.*



That’s why I didn’t choose him, you know: To make sure the life in his dead blue house was all he ever got.



But I’m getting ahead. I’m sorry. Sometimes I lose track when I remember how he fluttered his fingers.

I was talking about dreams.



My dreams were all I had, and most of them concerned the red house was on the bottom of the hill.



I loved the family in the red house. The parents, the pets, the giggling daughters and dark-haired son. Sometimes their laughter came rolling up the hill and died in my dead blue house.



Sometimes I gave their son dreams. No nightmares. Not for him. I gave him dreams of a beautiful version of me. I wanted him lost in dreams of me like I was lost in dreams of his red house.



So I controlled his dreams, just like I controlled mine.



The only dreams I couldn’t control were dreams of the devil, but even those were beautiful in their way.



In my dreams, the devil was small, lean and very fine, with marble skin, black hair, black eyes, and a mouth red as the tortured eyes of his hellhounds.



He had hellhounds. Two of them. Lean, hideous beasts with the faces of beautiful women.



Those hounds scared me more than the devil. In fact, the devil didn’t scare me at all. Not because he wasn’t scary — he was — but because the devil in my dreams was safer than the devil in my daddy.



Dreams were all I had. I didn’t like it, but I accepted it. My solution to *This is all I get* was to give myself everything else in dreams.



My father’s solution to *This is all I get* was *I’ll take everything I can.* He took everything he could, especially from me, and especially when he was drunk.



He got drunk a lot.



I still can’t look at a beer bottle without seeing the reflection of his TV screen on the curve.



I can’t look at hands drumming on anything — not tables, not counters, not any surface at all — without seeing his fingers fluttering on my skin.



It only happened when he was drunk, what he did. He always blamed it on the devil. He’d say, *The alcohol lets the devil out, and the devil likes you.*



I didn’t like that. It felt like the devil was punishing me for what my dad did. Like I was being damned for my father’s sins.



But in a way, it was a blessing and a curse.



Blaming the devil was a blessing because it meant I could keep loving my dad. If it was the devil, then it wasn’t really him hurting me, you see? He wasn’t the devil. He was just my daddy. 



Of course it was a curse because whether it was the devil or my daddy, I got hurt just the same…and because drunk devils don’t know the first thing about being gentle.



The devil is the devil no matter what, but at least in my dreams he was gentle.



The devil was not gentle outside my dreams.



He always left handprint bruises behind. They weren’t like other bruises. They were puffy and strangely swollen. They looked like real hands lurking underneath, trying to rise out of my own skin to kill me.



Sometimes I bled after. Sometimes I couldn’t walk well for a few days. Sometimes it even hurt to sit. And at church one Sunday, a whole week after my dad did what he did, I felt pain down there out of nowhere. I looked down and saw I was bleeding through my favorite dress. That dress was the only thing that ever made me feel pretty. And there it was, all ruined.



My mother rushed me home, but not before making me wipe the pew clean with my skirt. 



When we got home, she threw the dress away. Then she ran a bath and scrubbed me so hard it left me crying and her so exhausted she couldn’t even stand up straight after. I almost expected her to drop to her belly and crawl.



My mother knew all about devils. She knew so much that she became a devil herself. She knew what was happening to me and did nothing. Only a devil could do nothing.



Once, she came to me right after my father did what he did. I hoped she’d look on my tear-streaked face and be overcome with love or pity or *something*. She had the most beautiful voice, you know. Rich and smooth and lovely. I wanted to hear words of comfort spoken in her beautiful voice.



Instead she looked at me like she didn’t recognize me. Like I was unwelcome.



“I can’t stand you when you cry,” she said.



Then she paced my room while I struggled to quit crying. As she paced, her expression changed. On her first circuit, the unwelcomeness ceded to resentment. On the second, resentment became disgust. On the third, disgust turned to the sullen jealousy with which she looked at certain women at church. On the fourth circuit, she slapped me.



I hated her for that slap more than I hated my father for hurting me.



After she hit me, she pulled me in for a quick, cold hug, then cleaned up.



She stripped my stained bedding, scrubbed the spots on the mattress with peroxide, and washed everything until there was no hint of the devil or his filth.



And she never said anything about it, then or ever.



I’ve always been a ghost, but I think that was the day most of me died.



The only part of me that didn’t die was the part that dreamed.



I built so many beautiful dreams for myself, and created so many hideous nightmares for everyone else. My entire life slowly became a living dream.



On my seventeenth birthday, I woke from that dream as pale morning sun crept through the windows of the dead blue house.



*The longer you stay her*e, I thought, *the deader you’ll be. This is the only life you have. This is all you get.*



*So take more.*



But to take more, I needed to escape. To escape, I needed money. So I left school and got a job at the factory across town. The father who lived in the happy red house worked there. So did his dark-haired son.



He never even looked at me, but he didn’t need to. This was real life, after all, and I was a ghost who lived in dreams.



Those dreams were all I needed.



Shortly after I started my job, my father sustained an injury that left him too broken to work, but not too broken to keep taking from me.



All my money went to the household to make up for his loss. I had to secretly keep a few dollars each paycheck. I hid them under my stained mattress.



Of course my father found out.



He saw a single dollar peeking out one night, after the devil came to flutter his fingers along my skin but before the swollen handprint bruises.



When he found my dollars, he beat me so hard I saw stars. Among those stars was the devil. 



Not his devil, sad-eyed and lumbering, but my devil, lean and red-mouthed.



I hit him back.



I was strong now thanks to my shifts in the factory. He wasn’t strong, not anymore. So I kept hitting him.



*This is all I get*, I thought. *All I get. All I get.*

  


*So take more.*



I stopped short of killing him, not because I cared but because I didn’t want to go to jail. Then I took my money and left him mewling on my bed, which was finally stained with his blood instead of mine.



I got away. I really did.



But in order to survive, I had to let my own devil out. He was a bastard, but I suppose devils always are. He wasn’t my problem, anyway.



No, my problem was still my father’s dead blue house.



That house just wouldn’t let me go.



Now that I’d escaped it — now that it couldn’t have me in real life — it stole my dreams. My precious dreams. My dreams that were all I had.



I had nightmares of the dead blue house every night. Daymares, too. In these new, awful dreams I was always lame and crippled. The dreams had a sense of endlessness. Not eternity — there’s something beautiful about eternity. Endlessness is something else. Something hideous.



My new dreams were endless.



They began and middled and ended the same: with me crawling through the dead yellow grass in the shadow of the dead blue house while the devil spilled from my dad’s body and ran me down. I never knew if his devil meant to kill me or get inside me. I always woke before I found out.



I dreamed of nothing else. All my beautiful dreams, all my precious worlds, reduced to the dead blue house on the dead yellow hill and my father’s devil.



It was punishing me for running away, but I’d only run away because of what my father had done. I was damned for his sins yet again, and in the worst way possible because losing my dreams was the worst thing that ever happened to me.



But a free life without dreams was better than being at home with dreams. At least that’s what I told myself. Either way, that life was what I had. All I had. And I’d taken it myself.



So I learned to live with what I took.



After three years of living with what I took, I mustered the courage to call my mother.



The call quality was so poor, it turned her voice — her smooth, sweetly rich voice — into the hollow crackling of an old lady. She just said my name — “Sara!” Just like that. *Sara!* Like it was a miracle. Like she missed me. Like she loved me.



Then she told me to come home, so I hung up.



I called her back a year later.



I hoped the connection would be good enough to reproduce her voice faithfully. But no — once again it was just the distant, crackling warble of an old lady.



She cried. I couldn’t stand her crying any more than she’d been able to stand mine, so I hung up.



I called two years after that. I didn't say a word other than *Mother,* but she spoke enough for both of us. She said my father was very sick. One of the daughters from the red house at the bottom of the hill died in an accident. The mother was ailing and the father had run off, so the son came back home to care for her. Could I follow his example and come home to care for my father?



When I couldn’t stand the crackling warble anymore, I hung up.



I called a couple more times over the years, but only a couple.



Sometimes my dreams of the dead blue house included my mother’s voice. It filled the air, rich and smooth like I remembered. I loved it. But I couldn't dream of her voice without dreaming of the dead blue house and dead grey devil tearing out of my father.



Nothing — not my father’s sickness, not my mother’s voice, not the son in the bright red house — could compel me home. I would have done anything to stay away from the blue house forever except die.



But it came to that, eventually.



It came to that because I'd let my own devil out to survive. I had to. But letting my devil out turned me into a devil. All the things my devil did to keep me alive in this wide blue world nearly destroyed me.



I didn’t want to go back. I didn’t even want to be alive, but I wanted to die even less.



So I went home.



The dead blue house was as dead and blue as ever atop its dead yellow hill. That didn’t bother me. By then, it would have bothered me if it had looked alive.



But the bright red house at the bottom of the hill was dead and dull now, too.



That broke what was left of my heart.



I wept for the red house as I climbed up the hill through the dead yellow grass. Weeds and stickers snagged my clothes and pricked my skin until it bled. I didn’t like my blood touching the grass. I didn’t like that part of me would be trapped on that hill for all time.



The inside of the dead blue house was small and dirty and withered, but not as withered as my parents.



My mother was nearly blind and stooped so low it was a wonder she didn’t crawl. Her voice was no longer strong or smooth. Now it was just the same crackling warble I’d heard across thousands of miles of phone lines. I’d waited too long. Her real voice was gone now. I’d never hear it again.



My father was a twisted, wheezing scrap of suffering too weak to even move from his bed. Too weak to move at all, except for his gleaming eyes and his fingers fluttering on the bedsheet the way they used to flutter on me.



When I saw him, I thought, *This is all you get, and I’m glad.*



But I wasn’t glad for my mother, stuck taking care of him all by herself.



I tried to help her. But every time I entered my father’s dead blue room, my skin crawled and my ears buzzed. I’d blink and see puffy handprint bruises threatening to to rise out of my own skin to tear me apart. I saw TV reflections on every surface and bloodstains on every piece of fabric.



I knew the only way to stop all this was to speak to my mother. To have her finally hear me, to sit and listen and finally acknowledge what had happened.



Instead, she told me I was lying.



She said I was a stupid, thieving whore who’d been deadset on ruining the family from the start. *You were so horrible*, she warbled. *We had nightmares of you the second you were born, terrible nightmares where you scratched out our eyes and tore out our tongues. And we weren’t the only ones. Everyone had nightmares about you because everyone knew you were a monster. I wish you’d died. I wish you were dying instead of your father.*

  


I’m glad her voice was weak and crackling. I could tolerate those words in that voice. I’m grateful I never had to hear them in the rich, strong voice I loved so much.



Even so, those words broke me in ways I didn’t know I could be broken.



I couldn’t stand to be in the house after that. I couldn’t stand to be near them with their crackling voices and fluttering fingers. I couldn’t stand the reminder that I was now a ruined devil of a spinster with nothing, not even dreams. That all the years ahead of me would be just like the years behind me: Hard, ugly and meaningless. That dead blue houses and warbling mothers and devil nightmares were all I’d ever get.



I needed more. To get more, I needed to escape. So for the second time, I got a job at the factory.



Shortly after I started that job, my dreams came back. My real dreams, not the nightmares.

They were different now, with neither dead blue houses nor living red houses. In these dreams, I built a house of my own. Not blue, not red, but a new color just for me.



And I knew, somehow, that the only way I could keep my dreams was by staying in the dead blue house.



So I stayed.



By day I worked at the factory, and by night I helped my mother with her warbling voice care for my father with his fluttering fingers.



But one night, my father touched my arm and fluttered his fingers just like he used to. Then he smiled at me. A disgusting, wet smile that crept up his cheeks.



*This is all I ge*t, I thought. *This is all I’ll ever get*.



I ran out of the room and down the stairs to the kitchen where my mother stood, chopping vegetables for dinner with a knife so big it was a wonder she could hold it.



“What’s wrong?” she warbled.



“Him,” I said. “And you.”



I don’t remember much after that.



I remember she brandished the knife at me. It caught the dead blue light. I saw tomato seeds clinging to the blade, and a soggy curl of lettuce.



I remember shoving her.



I remember she fell and cracked her head on the counter. Blood spurted out the back like juice from the ripe tomato she’d just cut, and she crumpled.



I didn’t even move. I couldn’t. I could only stare down at my reflection in the knife.



Then the devil came out of me.



It helped me find a terribly dusty old step stool. I used the stool to stage the scene. To make it look like my mother had lost her balance and had a most unfortunate fall.



Then I called the police.



Two came. And wouldn’t you know it, one was the dark-haired boy from the red house, all grown up.



He looked at me long and hard, exactly the way I once dreamed he’d look at me.



Then he sat with me a while, there at my mother’s table in my father’s dead blue house.



At the end, he told me he still lived down the hill in the red house. “So let me know if you need anything,” he said. “Anything at all, and I’ll come.”



When he left, I put away the dusty old step stool all covered in my handprints. Then I went up to my father’s room to look at him.



He looked back at me, fingers fluttering on his blanket.



I went back downstairs.



I took three days off work. I didn’t sleep at all, but still dreamt the realest dreams I’d ever had, all of the devil. He stood out in the dead yellow grass, slim and dark and red-mouthed with his woman-faced hellhounds. I waved at him. He waved back.



Then I went to the table, put my head down, and slept for real. I dreamed I was the devil with hounds of my own.



When I woke, I heard my father mewling upstairs.



I ignored him and went to work.



On my way down the hill, I saw a light in the faded red house. A shadow moved across the window, then came out the front door. It was the dark-haired boy who was now a policeman. 

He offered to drive me to work. I accepted, and let him pick me up after my shift too.



For the next few days, he took me to work and brought me home.



I couldn’t help but wonder if he’d be so eager to help had he known of my helpless father mewling in his growing pool of filth.



The boy who was now a policeman picked me up on Friday night, and invited me in for drinks.



I looked at his red house, now dull and dead as my blue one. Then I looked at him. I wondered what happened when he drank. If a devil came out of him. I wondered if a devil would come out of me if I saw TV reflections in a glass bottle.



“Another time,” I said. “I have to take care of my father.”



“Of course,” he said. “Good night, Sara.”



I thought I was afraid. Of him, of what would happen between us, of how it might go wrong. 



But I was wrong.



The truth is I didn't really want him. What I wanted was my old dream of him. The dream that was always perfect. The dream I controlled. I knew I’d never control that boy who was now a cop.



And I didn’t want what I couldn’t control.



When I got inside the dead blue house, I heard my father crying upstairs.



I went up there and looked at him. At his mess, his fouled sheets, his angry red skin, his sores, his stench, his feeble fluttering fingers.



When I could stand his crying no longer, I went outside and walked all the way to the river. The cold water calmed me down. When I was calm enough, I went home.



I didn’t check on my father that night, or the next day.



But I saw him in my mind’s eye, rotting alive. Saw his fingers fluttering along the filthy bedding. Saw his sores that looked like bruises until they sank down to the bone and bloomed open like putrid pits. Inside of me are parts that felt like putrid pits. It’s all I had. All I got.



So I made sure that was all he got, too.



After he finally died, I slapped him.



Then I put him in the tub and scrubbed him until I was stooped and red-faced with effort. I dressed his hideous sores and put him in clean nightclothes. After that, I stripped his soiled bedding and scrubbed his mattress with peroxide. Then I carried him to my room downstairs, which was clean and airy and fresh.



Finally, I called police.



They came. Once again, the dark-haired boy from the dead red house was among them. He invited me home after.



I went, and never left.



In some ways, the boy was as dead and faded as his red house. Even so, he was gentle to me. 

He liked to hold my hands. He stroked them, studied them, kissed them. He kissed the rest of me, too. Kissed away pain and fluttering fingers and handprint bruises that swelled out of my skin.



Even though I couldn’t control him, even though I barely wanted him, I loved him so much.



So it figures that he turned out to be a devil too.



I won’t tell you how I found out, or even what he did that made him a devil. There’s no point. I *will* tell you the only reason I didn’t run is because he was a much different devil than my father. A devil I could maybe learn to live with, especially if he kept kissing the rest of me the way he kissed my hands.



“I need time, though,” I said. “You have to give me time.”



“Why?” he asked. “You’re a devil, too.”



“What do you mean?”



“I know,” he said.



“What do you know?”



“That you killed your parents.”



We were making lunch — isn’t that funny? Having this conversation while chopping a salad— and I was cutting tomatoes. The knife slid in my sweaty hand.



“I knew from the start,” he said. “Because of the stool. The step stool by your mom. It was dusty. So, dusty, but no footprints on it. Only handprints. Handprints the exact size and shape of yours.” He took my hand — not the one with the knife, the other one — and kissed it. “I won’t tell anyone. I don’t care.”



I felt relief. Immense, beautiful relief.



“I love you,” he said, “and your parents are no loss. I knew what they were, what they were doing to you. We all did.”



Everything inside me fell out of my body straight down to hell. “You knew?”



“Oh, yeah.”



“Why…why didn’t you do anything?”



He had no answer for me, or at least none worth repeating



As he recited the answer not worth repeating, I saw a shadow out the window. Lean as a whip, black as night and white as snow, with a mouth red as hellhound eyes.



I grabbed the knife, clingy with curls of soggy lettuce and tomato seeds, and plunged it into the boy’s chest.



He stared a moment.



Then he pulled that knife right out of his chest and plunged it into mine.



Everything went dark as the devil’s eyes.



Somehow I woke up in the dead yellow grass halfway between his dead red house and my father’s dead blue one.



I looked down at myself, and saw blood staining my dress again.



But it was on my chest. Only my chest, gushing from where my boy — my killer — had stabbed me.



Before I could make sense of anything, he came crashing out of his red house, wild-eyed and changed in the most terrible ways. When he saw me, he roared and charged.



I bolted up the hill to the dead blue house and swung inside, slamming the door just as he smashed against it.



I backed away. His shadow danced and surged, staining the blue light with his darkness as I stumbled over something soft and small and far too alive.



I looked down and saw my mother’s broken body slithering around my feet, head swinging from her broken neck.



Then I heard a familiar mewling echo upstairs.



“No,” I whimpered.



There came a heavy *thud* like something falling out of a high bed, followed by the lurching thumps of something large and weak hauling itself toward the stairs. The mewling swelled into gibbering whispers, which grew into laughter as the lurching thumps drew closer. His shadow appeared, twisted and ruined against the dead blue wall.



Finally, he peeked over the bannister.



I saw his grin first, wide and rotten, cutting across his withered cheeks like wounds. Then his sunken eyes, gleaming like pond scum. Then the rest of him, emaciated and blooming with foul sores, as he scrabbled clumsily down the stairs.



His atrophied body failed and sent him tumbling down. He landed in a pile, broken as my mother, but still smiling. His fingers fluttered along the floor as he rose and crawled toward me like a giant, crippled spider.



I stepped back just as my mother grabbed my ankle with thin fingers strong as steel traps.



My fear failed then.



Fear is power for the feared, right up until it turns to anger. Then it’s power for the fearful.

In that moment, my fear was anger.



I was angry. So, so *angry*.



I knew I was dead. So was my mother. So was my father And yet here we all were, trapped 

together in the dead blue house.



Even in death, this was all I got.



So I took more.



I stomped on my mother’s wrist with my free foot. She let go, weeping as I called her every name I could think of and told her to slither away.



She did.



My grinning father dragged himself across the floor, leaving a trail of thick wet mess. He reached for me, skeletal fingers fluttering.



I shrieked, “*Stop*!”



His hand halted midair, fingers trembling. His smile faded to a snarling frown at once absurd and horrifying.



Then he fell to his belly, staring up with his sunken, glistening eyes.



Just as I’d calmed down, the front door cracked apart and my killer came tearing towards me.



My rage nearly drowned me, but I turned that red tide on him just in time.



“Shut up,” I roared. “And get down.”



He froze. Hate burned in his blazing eyes, so strong even my red tide couldn’t snuff it out.



Then he, too, dropped to his belly as the broken door creaked behind him.



Framed in that doorway was my slim, red-mouthed devil flanked by his woman-faced hellhounds.



“Sara,” he said. “I need you to listen.”



I was a murderer. A filthy, broken murderer who had no right to deny the devil his due. So I sat by my growling killer to listen.



The devil told me I was special. That I’d always been special, but what had been done to me and what I’d done to others had changed things. That the bonds forged by suffering bound me to the people who had hurt me most, even now, even in death.



“So I’m in Hell,” I said. “And you’re the devil.”



“This isn’t Hell,” he said. “And I’m not the devil. I’m your savior.”



This made me feel insane.



It made me think I wasn’t dead after all. That I was maybe in an asylum somewhere, beating my head against a stone cell wall. I could only hope I’d hit hard enough to kill myself for good.



“If you don’t listen to me,” he said, “you’ll be trapped here with them forever.”



“For what I did to them?”



“No. For what they did to you.”



Tears flooded my eyes. “So I’m damned for their sins?”



“Only if you choose it.”



“I don’t choose damnation.”



“Good,” he said. “Do you remember your dreams?”



“Yes. They’re all I have.”



“They’re all you had,” he corrected. “You can have more now — if you take it.”



This was a lie.



I didn’t know that then. I should have, because the devil always lies.



But I didn’t.



I looked at him. Eyes so dark and mouth so red in a face so white. There was a mark on his neck. A tattoo of high, narrow horns arcing around the hollow of his throat.



“How do I take it?” I asked. “And what am I taking?”



“Control.” He motioned to the quivering trio around me. “These are the people who hurt you most. They had control over you before. You have control over them now. They will do anything and everything you say with no resistance, no question. But there’s a problem.”



“What?”



“There are three.” He patted his hellhounds. “But you can only have two. One has to go.”



“To where?”



“Death. Oblivion. Nothing at all.”



I felt sick. How funny, for a ghost to feel sick. “So they get to…to obey me or die forever? 

That’s all they get?”



“That’s all they get. Free the one who hurt you least, and bind the two who hurt you most.”



I looked at them. My mother quivering, my father snarling, my killer who I loved more than I've ever loved anything blazing hatred at me.



The two who hurt me most.



The obvious answer was my father and my killer.



But I remembered my mother slapping me on the day I bled at church. How she called me a lying, thieving whore. How she knew everything and did nothing.



Then I remembered my father raging, This is all I have. This is all I get.



I could make sure that life — that ugly, pointless, meaningless life — was all he ever got.



So that’s what I did.



“I want them.” I pointed to my mother and my killer.



My father’s foul body became dust. The last thing to vanish was his fingers, fluttering faintly until they crumbled.



I asked the devil, “I have control now?”



“Yes.”



“So I can do whatever I want?”



“*You* can’t do anything you want,” said the devil. “You’re little more than a ghost. You can’t touch anyone or anything except in dreams.”



“But I could do that before.”



“You can do it better now. And you can make *them* —” He pointed to my mother and my killer — “do anything you want out of dreams.”



“How do you know?”



“Because I see your bones,” he said. “They shine like starry ash.” Then he patted his hounds with their faces like beautiful women. “Think of them as dogs. Dogs need to eat. As the owner, it’s your responsibility to feed them.”



“What do I feed them?”



“You have to find that out yourself.”



I pondered this a while. Then I asked, “You’re really not the devil?”



“No.”



“Who are you?”



“Gunnar.”



“I like *devil* better.”



He smiled. “To tell the truth, so do I.”



We sat for a while in my father’s dead blue house. Maybe it was my imagination — or whatever passes for imagination in death — but I thought it looked less dead with him gone.



“So what do I do?” I finally asked.



“Make your dogs do whatever you want.”



I tried to think of what I wanted, but couldn’t. I could only think of what the boy who was now a cop said before I killed him. How he’d known what was happening to me. How everyone had known, but didn’t do a damned thing.



“I want to be the devil,” I said.



“I understand. But these are your devils.” He pointed to my mother and my killer. “Tell them what to do.”



“Will they listen?”



“Yes. You control them now.”



“Will you help?”



“If you like.”



I liked.



So, under the watchful eyes of a devil named Gunnar, I made my dogs do what I wanted.



What I wanted was to punish people who knew and did nothing.



I made my killer give the names of everyone who’d known what was happening to me and did nothing.



One by one, we tracked them down — me gliding like the ghost I was, flanked by my slithering mother and bounding killer.



When we found the people who’d known and did nothing, I made my mother and my killer take their eyes, their tongues, and their hands before killing them.



Once they were dead, my mother wept but ate. My killer radiated hate but gorged. They grew strong and monstrous together.



I stayed a ghost.



A weak and helpless ghost whose only power came from them.



“I want to be strong too,” I told the devil one night.



“Your strength is control,” he said.



“That’s not enough.”



“It’s what you have.”



*It’s what you have.*

  


*It’s what you get.*

  


*It’s all you’ve got.*



I didn’t like that.



So at our next kill, I stopped my mother from eating my victim’s tongue. I ate it instead. Then I ate his eyes and his hands.



By the time I finished eating, I was quite solid. No longer invisible. No longer weak. No longer a ghost.



And most strangely, I’d become very beautiful. Beautiful and strong.



But my mother and my killer had faded. They were weak. So weak I was afraid they’d join my father in oblivion. I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to give up control. I wanted them to feel powerless forever.



They didn’t die. They just kept fading until they were nearly ghosts.



Once they were nearly ghosts, *they* had power over *me*.



If it hadn’t been for the devil, they would have destroyed me.



But he was there, so I lived to learn my lesson. Not the devil’s lesson, which was weakness, but my own lesson, which was balance.



Next time I went hunting with my mother and my killer, I balanced our feeding. They each ate two pieces, while I ate one.



That balance gave me what I wanted: To be strong and beautiful and no longer be a ghost, to keep all three of us strong enough to help each other, without me sacrificing control.



It made the devil angry. “You can’t do this,” he said. “This isn't what we’re meant for.”



“What are we meant for?”



He didn't answer.



So I ate until he tried to stop me with his own hellhounds. They were the true danger. I had no hope of beating them. Nor did my mother or my killer, since my eating kept them weaker than the hounds.



But I had a chance at beating the devil, who was small and slim and tired.



I did.



Once I beat him, his hellhounds ran. He crawled after them, mewling.



I never saw them again.



I continued to hunt and eat with my mother and my killer.



I grew taller, stronger, more beautiful, and more awful. I liked being beautiful and awful. People fear awfulness. Fear is power for the feared.



But only for a while. Only until it becomes anger. Anger is power for the fearful.



That was a lesson I forgot until I was caught.



My mother and my bright-eyed killer tried to help me, but they weren’t real enough anymore. They were ghosts now, incorporeal and powerless. When had that happened? When had I upset the balance that kept each of us strong enough? I couldn’t remember.



I couldn’t remember.



If I’d maintained the balance, we could have fought the fearful people off together.



If I’d fed them as I was supposed to — all for them, none for me — I would never been a target to begin with.



But I did neither of these things. Instead I’d created the worst of both worlds. The worst of *all* worlds.



In this worst of all worlds, they watched and wailed as fearful people cut off my hands and took out my eyes and removed my head.



Those people buried me at a crossroads next to the dead yellow hill.



I slept there a while, in the peaceful dark.



And then the earth shifted, showing light and faces.



My mother and my killer, digging me free.



My killer raised my body from the grave, cradling me quite tenderly. I saw the flesh had melted from my hands, revealing bones that shone like starry ashes.



While he held me, my mother sewed my head back to the ragged stump of my neck. When she’d tied off the last stitch, I breathed in. The air was scented with nightflowers and the sweat of my killer.



He looked at me with a desperate love that eats instead of feeds. When had he come to love me? I couldn’t remember.



I couldn’t remember.



My mother gave me a look filled with resentment and jealousy. “Let me go now. Please.”



“There’s nowhere to go except oblivion,” I said.



“I’d rather have oblivion than life with you. Bury me in your grave.”



I felt a moment of weakness where I wanted nothing more than to put my mother in my grave and climb down with her. I turned to my bright-eyed killer. “Do you want to be buried too?”



“No,” he said. 



“Do you want to be free?”



“Never.”



“Then what do you want?”



“Life with you.”



So together, we sent my mother to oblivion.



Then we left his dead red house and my father's blue house and the rotten town that had killed me. We found a new house, warm and brown and bright, in a town that knew nothing about us.  They didn't know he was a devil. They didn’t know I was a murderer. They didn't even know I’d been dead once.



They still don’t.
