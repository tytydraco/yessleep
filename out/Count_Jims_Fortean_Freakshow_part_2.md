Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 19th, 1993 - Scrimbus, TX

I can't think or even write straight these past two days. This is the third attempt at writing this... My mind is a jumbled stream of consciousness. Please forgive my less than poetic writing today. Generalized anxiety disorder is a bitch sometimes... and the panacea of Prozac and Alprazolam aren't helping much.

Right. Yes. Better to clarify. Last entry… it’s a bit much, isn’t it? Untethered. Like a loose thread dangling, waiting to catch on something and… well, unravel the whole damn tapestry if the wrong hands get ahold of it. Not that I expect any wrong hands. I hope. Still, best. Context. That's what's missing.

You wouldn't get it, not really. Not unless you knew what we were, what I am. The Esoteric Order of the Other. Or EOTO, for short. Much shorter. Easier to say, less… grand. I hate grand. Grand is pretentious and usually followed by self-aggrandizement, which is, in most cases, a load of dirty barnacles. But anyway.

The EOTO. It’s not some club. Not a LARPing society that gets together to dress up in robes and chant about elder gods. Though, admittedly, some of the rituals… no. Focus. The EOTO. We’re here to watch, learn, protect. Protect them. Us, well, and them, too. The Otherlings. The… beings. Not of this… plane. Realm. Plane is for… for things that aren't here on Earth. No. Realm. That’s better.

Our goals are... well, the book. The book knows, but here… a summation will suffice. Listen. We monitor. We document. Paranormal. Supernatural. All the things that go bump in the night, or slither under the floorboards, or howl on the wind when the moon’s a sliver of bone. We study them. It’s a science, in a way, not one they teach in universities, though I’ll bet some professors would love to get their grubby mitts on some of our readings. We strive to protect. Yes. You hear of something out there, well, it’s likely we’re on it. Always. We maintain… Balance. Light and shadow, the mundane and the im… the Other… world. It’s delicate, thinner than they suspect. A breath, a wrong incantation, a misplaced word… the balance, it shifts, sways like a drunken sailor, and things get… messy. We train, educate. Not everyone can see it, or handle it. The Other, the true vision, the real world, the unseen... we teach those who… who can. We preserve what was, for fear of it all being lost, and we strive for… peace.

Ha. Peace. That’s a chuckle. It’s also the goal, the hope… A unity between those of the light, and the… well, you know. The Other. Maybe one day. Maybe on that day I'll finally have a nap that lasts for more than an hour.

Founded in the late 40’s, they found it, discovered it, the De Natura Alterius… not a book, really. More a… a compilation, a tome, a dusty one that's over 700 years old, that was sitting and mouldering in some monastery in Galicia, Spain. And in it… Shaitan. The… I can’t… the language… the description… It’s… too much. That’s… where it began. Their… education, from the mouth of the Other itself. They were shown, they learned, they grew, and one day… one day the world will finally... know.

Headquarters, or the first one, at least, it’s in Abilene. Texas. Don’t ask me why. It’s hidden, naturally, in plain sight. A nondescript office building they'd never suspect. Like everything. Like… me. We’ve got other places, scattered across the good ol' U.S. of A. Things disguised with… other things. Research societies. New age mumbo-jumbo book stores. All places of research. And containment. Oh, the things we have tucked away in dark basements… the things that stare… No. Focus. Labs, filled with scientific devices and… instruments. Ritual chambers… for banishings. Containments. It’s not just books and dusty tomes, we’ve got cutting-edge things that go… boop. Things the government would probably kill to get. Maybe they do keep an eye on us… some of them. We try not to get into too much trouble. Unnecessary attention is... detrimental.

Ah, yes. The feds. We’ve assisted… on occasion. And the North American Occult Research and Containment Coalition. NAORC… sounds like a disease. We work with them sometimes, a tenuous truce. A dance of wolves who all have blood lust, despite claiming otherwise. But our goals… they clash. Ultimately. We seek understanding, they seek control. Big difference.

And me? I’m Frater XII. Count Jim to the uninitiated. My little show on Big Country Public Access. “Count Jim’s Fortean Freakshow.” Where I talk on Bigfoot and UFOs and the grays and… things that go squish in the dark. It’s for recruitment, a way to find… them. Those who can see it, feel it. Those who can handle it. The BBS, too… that’s my baby. Connects them all. Gives them a place, a voice. The internet will eventually be a vast… ocean. Maybe one day it will swallow us all. And the EOTO, well… I brought us in, kicked and screamed, into the modern age. No more paper files… digitized, organized. Like a well-oiled gun, ready for… whatever.

So... that's us... that's me. That's… it. Almost everything.

The De Natura Alterius… the foreword added to the paperback version we all get, I think… maybe some of that will give… weight...

Here goes:

***By the hand of Brother Javier Vasquez, of the Order of the Temple, Anno Domini 1310***

***To my esteemed colleague, Brother Anselm,***

***May the light of Our Lord guide your hand as you read these words, though I fear they may instead lead you into the very heart of darkness. I pen this not with any hope of public dissemination, but with a desperate need to share the truths I have unearthed before the Holy See, in its infinite wisdom (or perhaps, in its infinite fear), silences me forever. For what I have seen, what I have learned, defies all that we hold sacred. Know this, Anselm, the world is not as it seems. There is a grand tapestry woven with threads of light and shadow, and we, in our pious blindness, have only ever seen half of it.***

***For months I have resided in a cave, a place that smells of earth and something… ancient. This cave, tucked away in the desolate hills surrounding Jerusalem – the very landscape that witnessed the divine – holds secrets whispered from a time before time. It is here I encountered him. I call him Shaitan, for that is the name by which he allows. Though the name bears the weight of evil, do not be misled to expect some cloven-hooved demon with pitchfork in hand. He is...other. He is not of our making, not of our God, and he is far, far older than any scripture. Shaitan is an Otherling, one of the so-called “monsters” that slink in the shadows of our world.***

***His form is… unsettling. I have seen men marked by the pox, by the lash, by the ravages of war, but Shaitan...his flesh is like hardened leather, scales like a serpent’s hide, and two curved horns sprout from his brow. And yet, within those eyes, I see not the infernal glow we are taught to expect, but the dull embers of an immeasurable ennui. The very air about him seems to hum with an ancient weariness. It was from Shaitan I gleaned what I am about to impart, knowledge that I fear will damn my soul to perpetual fire.***

***Shaitan spoke of the very beginning, before the light, when the primordial darkness existed as a sentient being. Imagine, Anselm, not an absence of light but a thinking, feeling void. This darkness, in its boundless loneliness, witnessed the birth of the universe with the ‘prick of light’ which grew and grew into the cosmos we know today. As the cosmos expanded, so did the loneliness grow within this entity. It sought communion and observed life springing forth across countless worlds, each a beacon of light against its own vast dark. It was this which led it to act. The primordial darkness, in its yearning for company, used the shadows cast by the light to imbue them with its own essence, creating beings it intended to be emissaries of friendship. These emissaries were not monsters either, Anselm. They were beings of immense power, gifted with knowledge, longevity, and the inclination to extend these boons to the burgeoning worlds that sprouted across the infinite cosmos.***

***But these emissaries were not embraced with open arms. Instead, the beings of light, driven by a primal instinct to fear the night and the secrets it holds, saw these emissaries as "demons," as harbingers of chaos. Their gifts, whether of immortality or of advanced knowledge, were deemed the fruits of unholy bargains, and the emissaries themselves became the embodiment of "evil". In this great cosmic misstep, the primordial darkness, the very source from which all of it came, became mislabeled as the “Other”. Even though the dark was there for aeons before.***

***Those who were willing to look beyond the initial fear, the few that accepted these gifts, became known as “the Children of the Other” or “Otherlings”. Shaitan himself is one of them. Here on earth, we have labeled them with all manner of monstrous names and fearsome legends: gargoyles, dragons, spirits, witches, even demons. But Shaitan assures me they are merely beings who exist outside the limited understanding of most men. That they are, in their essence, like you and me. There are good and evil ones, compassionate and vicious, just as there are amongst the sons of man.***

***From what Shaitan has told me, the emissaries were treated poorly across much of the universe, and as such many have retreated to the shadows. Most have become reticent and shy, some have turned to spite and malice as a way of shielding themselves from the beings of light. A few hold to the hope that understanding will be found. Just a few. There are, Shaitan swears, a handful of worlds where the Children of the Other and the children of the light have learned to coexist in harmony, but these are so few that they can be counted on one hand. It is a heartbreaking thought, that such a rare and wondrous thing exists, only to be snuffed out by the fear of the unknown.***

***My time with Shaitan has been an upheaval of everything I have been taught to hold sacred, but I can no longer deny what I have seen. I have looked into his eyes, and I saw not the face of hell but of a lonely being who remembers a time before we even existed. I tell you this, Anselm, that the Other lives among us, in the shadows, in hidden places beneath our very feet. They are waiting. Some long for peace, some for vengeance, and others perhaps, are simply waiting for the next time they fall into a long slumber. The majority live in sprawling underground communities with wondrous amenities powered by what Shaitan describes as "electricity", a form of lightning like that which is said to emanate from the Ark of The Covenant. Despite this, they yet still depend on sympathetic members of the light for protection and resources. They are not our demons. They are, like us, simply trying to survive.***

***May God, in his infinite mercy, forgive me for writing these heretical truths. But I cannot bear to keep them hidden. I write this in the hope that you can somehow understand the implications of this discovery, and perhaps, work towards a future where we bridge the gap between the light and the shadows. Should you deem me a heretic for this, I will accept the penance. Know that I did not do this lightly and do not regret seeking the truths, no matter how terrible they might be.***

***May God have mercy on our souls.***

***Your brother in Christ,***

***Javier Vasquez***

It’s… poignant. A bit melodramatic. But, it’s the truth. All of it. Poor guy... Not only can I feel the difficulty reconciling his faith with Shaitan's revelation... I hear the Pope had his eyes burned out and then buried alive.

Now… the last few days. The show… October 16th. The phone call. The static. Flipped-out images. Not normal. Not at all. And it keeps replaying in my mind. A loop… a glitch in the system, maybe. Or, maybe, a window. And they’re watching. Always watching. I feel it. A tingling in my bones… that familiar dread that sits where my heart used to be.

I’ve been prepping for next Saturday’s show. The usual: cryptid sightings, some high strangeness from down state, a new batch of audio recordings that… they chill me even while listening to them for the tenth time. But… I’m on edge, like a rabbit in a wolf cage.

You saw my messages to Soror XI, clear ones. No, very clear ones, about my concern. About the anomalies. Nothing. No reply since that little chat we had. Her usual stoicism is… unnerving right now, even for me. Is she… is she ignoring me? Is she…. No. She’s busy. She has to be. She’s always busy.

The pills are helping, right? They have to be. The sweating, the twitching… it always comes when it’s like this, when that feeling comes… the knowledge that something is very, very wrong. Better make some more notes for the show. Keep busy. Keep moving. Gotta keep… sane. Or what passes as sane for me. Damn this anxiety. Damn it all to Hell.

Next Saturday. Time to freak out the squares. Because something is coming, and they need to know. Even if I don't know everything about it.

Gah. I usually write better than this. My mind is foggy... disjointed. But.. screw it... I'm not tearing any more pages out of this journal to start over again. This is the best you'll get out of me today.
