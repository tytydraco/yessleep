My story begins an year ago, when I was desperate, as I got fired. Someone proposed me a way to make some money.

All I had to do was to pretend I was a software technician, say a few standard phrases, then ask the person with whom I was speaking with to call a certain number. That was it! Once a month I got paid.

All went well until, with the corner of my eyes, I was catching glimpses of something moving.

I ignored this and went on with my "job". Later, I saw shadows passing through. At first, there were just glimpses, then I saw them moving in front of me.

At night, I begun hearing footsteps. My TV switched on as I left the room. Then, I turned it off again. It went back on. I turned it off.

I waited. Nothing happened. Then, suddenly it moved by itself. It stopped.

All was quiet for a few weeks. Then, I got arrested. To my surprise, I learned I was an accomplice to a major scam operation.

I was put in jail, sharing a cell with another man, of similar age. We talked, we got along well.

At night I could hear something touching the metal cell bars, scratching them.

My cellmate was asleep. Another day, I heard footsteps. No one was there.

One night, I couldn't sleep. My cellmate couldn't sleep either. We talked, then, for some reason we begun arguing.

His eyes turned fully red, he begun roaring and hissing and just screaming uncontrollably.

Suddenly, and he moved way faster than a human could, he was near me. He almost teleported next to me, that's how fast he was.

He grabbed me by the throat, suffocating me, as he screamed. He then emitted a sound, like that of a pig.

I hit him. He squealed and squeeked as he changed towards me. A guardian arrived and took me away. The cellmate stopped.

Later, he told me he couldn't remember anything he did that night.

Then, I was released. I had a great lawyer, who managed to prove I was just an innocent accessory to a scam. Not guilty.

I returned home, deciding that I will never have anything to do with those scammers again.

I got a new job. First, it was quiet. Then, every night, I would feel someone enter my bed. I could feel its breath next to my ear.

One night, I woke up. Next to me, there was a completely black creature with horns and eyes glowing red.

I screamed like I never did before in my life. The entity disappeared, but the door swinged open, then closed by itself.

I was convinced it was a demon. I called a paranormal investigation team.

After studying my case, they concluded someone sent that demon to torment me. The EVPs came out and we could hear something laughing. And demonic voices saying obscenities.

A house exorcism will be performed. Now, I am waiting for the Church's approval to proceed.

I still feel the entity entering my bed. I can hear footsteps and dishes that move by themselves.

I hope things will calm down soon. But I know what I did was wrong, and I wish I didn't accept that job.

I am alone as I am writing this. 

Just me, and the shadows that glide across the walls, the TV that constantly turns itself on and off and the entity, whose target I became.
