In a small town there lies a crooked house on a hill in which a crooked man lies. The people no wonder how or why. In fact, the man himself knows not why or how he is there or what he is. He simply knows people are fond of him and no longer question his odd and quite frankly horrid appearance. He is just that crooked and can't stand straight, Let alone hold the same posture. Only one detail remains the same. Just like the rest of him his head isn't quite right. It can never seem to stand upright. Always cracked, laying on his left or right shoulder. When you hear this, you probably default to horror. Just as the villagers did before accepting him.  
  
 But time moved forward, and he showed them how to live when it got colder. How to plant crops and the knowledge of what soil was older. People grew older and over time less cold. Old as a concept itself did not pertain to the crooked man's knowledge nor did he understand it. He would however see the end of it. When the first resident passed away in their sleep. He would experience grief for the first time along with the villagers. Thinking of them he would get to work. The next day the villagers awoke to a fresh cemetery.  


 The fact it was built in the blink of a single night was unfathomable. Just as bewildering the appearance invoked no sadness despite being attached so close to death. The crooked man encouraged the townsfolk to step in. They were greeted to a celebration of the man who passed. They all laughed and cried and upon the time of the burial one detail could not go unnoticed. Inscribed on the man's tombstone was no generic quote or holy scripture. But a direct address to everyone the man loved. The people who knew the townsman couldn't even make the accusation of fabrication as the words matched the man too well.  


Time has moved on since then and the Crooked man has continued to be considered as family. From helping others to be a shoulder to cry on. After all he does have only one reliable one as if made for this purpose. Even then in the few instances of crime he has turned the other cheek.  The perpetrator was exiled and promised no harm. As well as the proclamation that they would never return. The laws of logic and realism are absent. No matter what method the man tries to return will prove faulty.  As if something the human mind couldn't comprehend acted as a lock.

As I write this at the end of my life and can rest knowing this is a place of peace. I will be celebrated, my children and theirs will be in good hands. No moss or dirt, let alone any filth will cover my grave. The man remembers every name and person that lies in the graveyard.  So, for my last night I could feel death creeping and as the man visited me, I asked a simple question.

&#x200B;

What is your name? I got my answer, it was not what I expected and yet made perfect sense.

&#x200B;

 What is the need? I am simply what I am and no name can perfectly describe or inform the listener what that individual is? Good,evil or what they have been through. A name only has meaning to those who choose to spend their time alongside it and what that individual does with the time they have.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 So as I close my eyes knowing this will be my last sleep, I have but one last thing to say that everyone in this village knows. Something does not have to be understood to be treated with decency and acceptance.
