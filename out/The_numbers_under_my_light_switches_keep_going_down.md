I moved into this apartment three months ago.
It wasn’t much just a one bedroom on the top floor of an older building. The rent was low, the neighborhood was quiet, and it was a short walk to work. The place had high ceilings, old wooden floors, and windows that let in the morning light in a way that almost made it feel warm here.

For the first few weeks, it felt… normal.

The first odd thing happened on a Sunday afternoon while I was cleaning the kitchen. I was wiping down the counters when I noticed something under the light switch faint, like it had been written with a fine black marker. Just a number: “42.” Small, right where the switch plate met the wall.

I figured it was from the previous tenants. A builder’s note, maybe. I didn’t think much of it until a few days later, when I saw another number in the hallway: “39.”

Different room. Same handwriting. Same placement.

A week later, I found another one in the bathroom: “36.” That’s when I started noticing the pattern. The numbers were going down, always in increments of three.

I mentioned it to a friend after work. He laughed and said it sounded like some kind of bad horror movie countdown. 
“Probably leftover from a renovation,” he said. I wanted to believe him, but the handwriting didn’t look like a quick scribble from a contractor. It was neat, almost careful.

Over the next two weeks, I checked every switch in the apartment. I found more numbers: 33 in the bedroom, 30 in the living room. Every one was written in the same neat style, small enough to miss unless you looked closely.

Then one night, I walked into the kitchen and froze. I could have sworn the number there had been “42” when I moved in. Now it read “27.”

I told myself I’d remembered wrong. To be sure, I took photos with my phone. The next morning, the photo still showed “42.” But on the wall, the number was “24.”

That’s when I started keeping a log. Every morning, I checked each switch and wrote the numbers down. Without fail, they dropped by three overnight.



Three days later, the hallway switch was down to “15.”

That’s when I noticed something else.

I wear a smartwatch that tracks my sleep. Out of curiosity, I compared my log to my sleep data. The night the hallway switch said “15,” my watch showed I had been up and moving at exactly 1:15 a.m.

I don’t remember getting out of bed.

The next night, the living room switch went from “15” to “12.” My watch showed movement at 12:12 a.m. That same night, a glass I’d left in the sink was sitting on the counter in the morning.

I live alone.


At work, I found it hard to focus. I’d be halfway through an email and catch myself staring at my hands, wondering what they’d been doing while I slept. I started drinking more coffee than usual just to get through the day. My coworkers noticed. One of them asked if I was okay. I told her I’d been having trouble sleeping. I didn’t tell her why.

One night, I tried to stay awake. I sat on the couch with all the lights on, watching videos on my phone. I remember seeing the clock hit 12:05. I blinked and it was 1:14 a.m. My phone was on the table. My legs felt heavy, my mouth was dry, and I was sitting in a slightly different position.

The numbers kept dropping.

By the time the kitchen switch hit “6,” I felt like I was constantly on edge. I kept the TV on for background noise, but the apartment still felt too quiet, like the walls were listening.



Two nights ago, I decided to record myself. I propped my phone against the hallway wall so it could see the kitchen and hallway switches.

I went to bed with the covers pulled tight, heart pounding.

I woke up at 3:48 a.m. on the couch. I don’t remember walking there. My phone wasn’t where I left it. I found it on my nightstand. The video file was there, but when I tried to play it, it was corrupted black screen, no sound.

That morning, the kitchen switch said “3.”

I spent the rest of the day avoiding the apartment. I walked around the city aimlessly until the sun went down, drinking coffee just to have somewhere to sit. I didn’t want to be here when it hit zero.


Tonight is the last night.

Every switch in the apartment now reads “0”except the one in my bedroom. That one says “1.”

I’ve locked the front door. Every light is on. My watch says it’s 11:54 p.m. I’m sitting on my bed, staring at the bedroom switch.

If the pattern is real, it will happen at 1:00 a.m.


My chest feels tight. I keep glancing at the door, then the switch, then the clock. My ears strain for every sound, but the building is silent except for the hum of the lights.

12:15 a.m. — My eyes keep drifting to the hallway.

12:32 a.m. — I thought I heard something shift out there. Like fabric against the wall.

12:50 a.m. — My mouth is dry. I keep telling myself to stay put, but my legs feel restless, like they’re waiting for something.


Tonight, I’ve left every light on. I’m sitting in the hallway because it’s the brightest place when everything else wants to go dark. I hear nothing. I hear everything. I know I’ll stand up soon, even if I don’t know why. I know I’ll place my hand on the wall where the numbers were, even though there’s nothing there now.

And I know that in the silence, I’ll hear that same soft, patient sound again the one that never tries to scare me. It just waits.
Until I decide to count.
Or stop.
