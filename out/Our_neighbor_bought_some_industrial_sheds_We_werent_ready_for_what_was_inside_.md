My neighbor started acting strange before he got the actual sheds. I guess he'd been having family trouble for a while because we could hear him and his wife get into pretty heated arguments from our backyard. Then I caught him sitting on the roof of his wife’s bright pink Honda civic at 1:00 at night. For a while they had a young dark-skinned man living in a tent in their backyard. Hurricane put an end to that arrangement when the tire swing came loose and tore a hole in the roof.

Despite these scattered weird moments, we weren't bothered by the neighbors. They never commented on us smoking weed so we tried to let him work his shit out. I was living with my girlfriend at the time and once, while taking out the dog, she caught the daughter, just about college age, bawling her eyes out in the broken tent. They shared an awkward wave over it. We stopped seeing her around the house after that.

It was after falling out, when he seemed to always be alone in the house, that our neighbor brought in the sheds. These weren't the kind of things you could just pop into the hardware store and order. They were old, with black numbers printed on the side. One was smaller than the other and came up to about my shoulders. It might have held a rake or a shovel if the handle wasn't too long. The other was taller than me and looked to have about 5 square feet of space inside. This was the tougher one, and the neighbor called every friend he had to slide the sheds off the truck and onto some raised pallets. He rented some serious industrial equipment to lower them to the ground.

My girlfriend and I were realizing a lot of things about ourselves at the time, and we thought that being almost thirty meant that we either had to get married or break up. We were taking hits in the bathroom and talking about the future when we got interrupted by the baby crying. Our upstairs neighbor had a kid of their own, but he was almost ten. This was coming from the neighbor's house. We talked about how it was good that the family must be reconciling. Maybe he'd stop standing outside his house and staring down the road in the middle of the night.

Our yards weren't separated by a fence or anything. There was a big old oak tree that acted as the line of demarcation but otherwise the borders had to be imagined. Whenever we took the dog out, we saw the brutal sheds and joked about what was inside. Maybe some kind of monster, or dozens of pounds of uncut cocaine. We theorized about dead bodies a lot; who they were and how he'd killed them. 

As morbid as that sounds, it was all in fun. Sure, we didn't trust him, but to be honest I've never trusted my neighbors. I was still in the closet then and didn't want anyone to catch me in a dress, so I kept all of my windows pulled shut and only went outside in girl-mode when the coast was clear. This was a surprise to my girlfriend, and we were having one of our talks about it late at night, smoking in the backyard to get through it, when we saw him take the first little tin lunchbox out to the shed.

We went to the other side of the house and relaxed enough that the old jokes came back. No way that man wasn't importing some primo black-tar heroin. Maybe it was the president's finger and he was holding it for ransom. We fell back into an awkward silence once the humor faded. If we hadn't, my soon-to-be ex wouldn't have heard what he said.

"Did you hear that?" she asked me.

"The shed closing?"

"He told it 'Goodnight'."

I was certain he was either on the phone, or talking to a neighborhood cat, but she insisted that she could see him from the corner of the house. Nothing there but the sheds. 

The mystery propelled our relationship another month. More little boxes came in and out and gave us something to theorize about, joke about, and get scared about. We saw the baby more often. She was just old enough to try and grab the big wheel of grandpa's riding mower from his lap. Our prediction was that the mother had dropped the kid off and run away. It's sad but it happens. Then marital strife kicks in between the grandparents, a lot of "I never agreed to raising another child" fights, and then grandpa watches grandma leave in that hideous hatchback.

Answers came the night of our big fight. I was upset about something too personal to share, but it was bad enough that my ex wanted me gone and I was happy to oblige. I didn't really think about the fact I was leaving through the back door, or that I slammed it so hard. I caught the neighbor rushing inside. His shed's chain was unlocked. As much as I'd kept vague track of the neighbor's comings and goings, I didn't care about the sheds at this point. My ex came out, maybe to apologize, maybe to tell me off about slamming the door. I never knew her intentions because the baby was crying again. I didn't think anything of it, but I could see realization pass over her face.

"You heard that too, right?" she asked.

"Yeah, but-""Just watch out for me. I need you to yell if you see him in the window."

She was off. She'd come outside in socks and stepped off our little concrete porch block in silence. I was still mad. I didn't want to be there, but that look told me this was about more than us right now. I kept my eyes on the windows. A touch-activated plant lamp blocked part of my view, but other than that I could see what I needed: the back door was in sight from this angle. My ex pulled the chains down with as much quiet as she could manage. To her credit, the links clinked together like loose change instead of colliding freight trains. I heard her mutter something, and then I heard her mutter something again. I spared a quick look in that direction. Her wide eyes met mine. Remembering my role, I turned in time to see the lamp in the window turn off. I moved to her side to try and get her back home, but I heard someone whisper, "Is that you?"

The baby cried again. It was so loud in the silent night. This time I knew what bothered my ex about it. She reached inside the shed, grabbed hold of something, and pulled, until I saw her struggling against a thin white arm under the moonlight. A terrified eye looked up at us in the gleam. Old blankets piled the floor and a cracked iPad played children's shows in one of the cramped corners. The infant cried and squirmed in the wrappings of its baby blanket. It must have been eighty-five degrees that night.

"Please," said the voice in the shed, "It's fine. Don't make him mad."

I returned to my watch. The backdoor was shut, and I told myself that it would stay that way as long as I kept my eyes glued to it.

"You need to come out," my ex said, "Are you hurt? Can you move?"

"Please just go, I'm okay, don't-"

The door opened.

I tugged hard on my ex's shirt. She pulled on the arm. I saw a woman inside, gaunt, with one exposed breast. Instead of following us, the baby appeared in the moonlight, held up by a shaking hand. My ex took her instead.

The neighbor was at the top of his short concrete steps with a look of panic like I've never seen. The woman in the shed yelled something, but I had 911 on the line by that time and wasn't listening. We were back in our yard by the time he started after us with the aluminum bat. We got inside and hunkered down with our dog inside of our windowless laundry room and locked every door along the way.

It was terrible waiting for the cops to come. I wish I could say that I was thinking about the person we left in the shed, but I was worried about me. I waited for the sound of smashing glass. I waited for the crack and slam of the neighbor kicking the door in. We didn't get that. We heard him whack that bat against the outside wall twice, scream curses at himself, and that was it.

Emergency services got there in the end. Infant babble turned to infant scream and back again as we explained and re-explained what happened. EMS took the baby, and it was during the hand-off that I heard my ex fill in the parts I didn't see during lookout.

There was a young woman in the shed. Covered in burns from leaning against the interior of the shed during the boiling Florida summer. She was in clear trouble, either sick, or starving, or something. Neither of us recognized her until my ex caught her last scream.

She'd cried out, "Daddy."

I tried to picture the young woman she found crying in the backyard as the emaciated person we found on the floor of that shed. Somehow, I still can't quite believe it. 

The cops couldn't find her. No sign, which was better than her turning up dead. The other three sheds were open when they got there. I don't know if there were similar situations in each, or if the others were just for tools and lawn care. My ex knew, but I didn't want to hear more about it. I would have found out during the trial if "Daddy" hadn't cut things short by hanging himself.

The baby ended up with her father, the guy that was living in the tent months ago, and I could see he was conflicted. We talked one time, while I was getting the last of my stuff from my ex's apartment, and he told me he had been ready to be part of things, take care of his baby, but Daddy wasn't going to allow him to stay in the same house as his daughter. He wasn't going to let her get pregnant twice. 

He had a lot of guilt for how bad things got. The whole time he'd been sending money. Now he has no idea where it was going. We agreed that she must have been saving it, ready to get out of there the second she could. No way Daddy was pocketing it. It was a brief but cordial conversation. He told me to come to the kid's birthday. We swapped numbers. It didn’t seem like he had anyone else to invite. 

We, my ex and I, have spent months trying to find the woman in the shed. We want to make sure she got help and isn't out there alone in unsafe conditions. Her daughter is safe, healthy, and has room for another parent in her life. After the trauma she went through we'd all understand if the mother didn't want to come back, but we'd at least like to talk. One of our goals, for instance, is family medical history. A phone call would do just fine.

Even if we never get a word from her, we hope she is out there recovered or recovering. Not everyone gets to walk away from something like this and we know that if she was strong enough to make it through her time in the shed then she's strong enough to make it through anything. While thinking over the events, I’m often reminded that nobody has heard her end of things yet. For as terrible as we know it was, we still don't know how bad it got.

The last development surprised me, even though it might be the most mundane part of the whole experience. The child’s grandmother came back. My ex spotted her moving back into that house with the help of their 6’3 son. We’ve tried knocking on her door or catching her attention while she was outside. She ignores us or runs to her car and peels down the road. The son we’ve spoken to once. He told us in a half-growl that he has nothing to say to us. We didn’t push it. He’s built like a linebacker, and I guess nothing’s going to change the fact that we got his dad put away.

Grandma kept the shed open too. Nothing has been touched since the night it all happened. Maybe she just can’t deal with it. Maybe it’s something else. A few nights this week I’ve looked down from my second-story apartment and spotted a bright pink Honda civic in the parking lot. Tonight marks the third time. I’m keeping an eye on it as I write this. Someone’s in it and I know they’re looking this way from the lightpost glint on their sunglasses. I tell myself it isn’t the grandmother. I don’t know how she got my address. I don’t know what she wants with me after avoiding us for all this time, but my ex sent me a picture earlier that gave me a chill. Now I’m wondering if it’s enough to call the police.

The photo is of the neighbor’s backyard; two new sheds with dangling chains sit open on either side of the original. The floors are covered with new blankets. It's ninety degrees out tonight and I’m wondering how it feels to fall asleep against one of those hot tin walls. I hope I’m wrong about what’s happening. I hope I never find out.
