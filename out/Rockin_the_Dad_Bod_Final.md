Kevin fished around in Castle’s pockets and retrieved the keys to his truck. Castle’s incoherent moaning picked-up a little while Kevin was searching him.

*I could end up like that*, I thought\*. All it takes is for some other player to gently tap me. Is that what death is like here? Is it worse than oblivion because I’ll stay in that semi-conscious state forever?\*

I followed Kevin into the parking lot. He handed me the Castle’s keys. “Okay, here’s the plan –“

“Woah – you want me to drive this thing? I can’t do that.”

He pointed to his crown, “King.” He rapped on my helmet like he was knocking on a door. “Pawn.”

I sighed and yanked the keys from his hand. “I don’t even know how to drive a -“

“The plan,” he interrupted. “Listen. There are two key elements to the plan. One – you drive this thing north, to Rankate Park. Two – and this is the key part of the plan - make bad decisions. You have to do what you do best which is to make terrible decisions.”

“That’s not even a plan! That’s just … “ I struggled to find the words. “That’s just you insulting me in a parking lot.”

“North!” he said. “Rankate Park! Bad decisions.” Then he spun around and marched back into the E6.

I climbed into the cab of the truck. I’d never been in the cab of an eighteen-wheeler before. The steering wheel was huge, and was mounted on the dash at a weird flat angle. The shifter looked like some kind of puzzle with three reverse gears and a ten or so forward gears. The dash had five times the number of gauges than a regular car.

Castle had positioned the driver’s seat so far back that my feet didn’t event brush the pedals. I fumbled around for a few seconds before I figured out how to slide it forward. A chess piece – a rook - was stuck to the dashboard with a suction cup. I pulled it off and tossed it on the passenger seat. This was my truck now. A pawn’s truck.

I found the ignition and turned it on.

The truck rumbled to life. The deep growl under the hood had a heaviness to it, like I was about to drive one of the Earth’s tectonic plates instead of a vehicle. I said what I’m guessing everyone says the first time they sit in the driver’s seat of a big rig.

“Oh *Yeah*…”

I smirked the smirk of someone about take control of something that could generate far more power than they could control, and put the truck into first gear.

The truck stalled as soon as I eased my foot off the clutch. I messed with the shifter and tried again. Stall. I moved the shifter through its little labyrinth of gear positions to make sure I had it in the first gear. Stall. I honked the horn, just to make me feel like I was in control of something, then I messed with the lever on the shifter. This time the truck slowly crawled forward when I hit the gas.

I steered towards the ramp from the E6 parking lot to the northbound side of the highway. I shifted twice more before I reached the road, but was still only moving about fifteen miles an hour despite being in third gear.

I managed to get the truck up to a normal highway speed with only a few severe gear grinding incidents. I imagined Castle, still writhing and moaning on the floor of the E6 travel store emitting tearful whimpers of pain each time I ground the gears on his truck.

I found the control for the windshield wipers. I figured out how to turn on the headlights. In my button-pushing and switch-flipping I accidentally turned on the sound system. Evil-sounding German industrial metal music blasted into the cab. The relentlessly driving industrial metal filled me with confidence and I shifted through three more gears, getting the truck up to seventy or so. Was this what Castle was listening to when he decided to ram Kevin and I? Soon I was singing along, even though I had no idea what the German words meant.

*"Got vise ish vil kine Engel zine."*

I passed a sign:

*Rankate park: 2 miles*.

I had almost completed the first phase of Kevin’s “plan.” I started to ponder the second part, where I was supposed to make bad decisions. Is it even possible to wisely make a bad choice? Is planning to have a bad plan a paradox?

The trees surrounding the highway thinned, then were suddenly gone entirely as the highway crossed a stretch of farmland. The rain stopped abruptly. The clouds thinned and the light of the full moon washed away the night's impenetrable gloom. Was this new landscape and new weather a sign that I had I crossed into a new cell on the grid?

Beyond the fields, it seemed the world ended. The road traced a path between the fields into an immense dark void beyond. I let off the gas a bit as I tried to understand what was beyond the fields. Was the void *the black edge of the board* that Kevin told me about at the party?

I drove past another sign:

*Rankate Park: 1 mile.*

*No Beach Access*

I laughed at myself for a moment. The endless darkness beyond the fields was just the ocean. I stepped on the gas again to get back up to highway speeds.

There was movement to my left. Someone passing me? I checked the driver-side mirror and saw nothing but empty highway behind me. I looked out into the field to my left. Something was out there. It was a monster. No, correction, *she* was a monster.

I didn’t think “oh, a monster,” right away, of course. The human brain doesn’t work that way when it encounters something new. The visual system needs a second to grasp what it sees. It hands over its results to the cortex, which has to think things through a bit. Once the cortex ponders it for bit, and understands just how “wrong” what its seeing is, the limbic system takes over. The limbic system needs another half-second-or-so to figure out that “fear” is the right response. Well, in my case, terror was what it dialed up.

At first I thought the large object in the field to the left of the road was a dilapidated structure – maybe a half-demolished grain silo or water tank. But no. It was moving. Not just traveling forward, parallel to the road, but running at the same speed as the truck.

It was maybe twenty feet tall – too large to be any kind of normal animal. As I more fully processed what I was seeing, I saw that it *wasn’t* running, exactly. It was galloping. No not even galloping– galloping is something that creatures with four legs do. This thing had more than four legs. Six? Probably more. It was hard to tell because it was wearing a *dress*.

It – she – whatever - was human-like, in that she was wearing clothes, had legs, a torso, arms, and a head all arranged in the normal vertical way that we humans are organized. Her human-like arms were attached at the shoulders, but there were way too many of them. She had eight arms.

Her head was a grotesque oversized mass. A human head scaled up to hold eight separate faces, each looking out from the eight main compass points. The resemblance to the eight-faced horror version of myself I saw in the reflection of the window and the rear-view mirror was obvious. One difference between her eight-faced abomination of a head and what I saw of my own in the mirror is that she wore an enormous crown of steel spikes. This thing, this *person*, had to be the queen. The black queen.

I startled as the truck drifted over the rumble strip on the right side of the road and onto the shoulder, I overcorrected, sending the truck into the center of the road. The queen also heard the truck hit the rumble strip. She turned her head slightly and sneered at me with two of her faces. Her faces – the two that looked at me anyway - reminded me of the Statue of Liberty. They had a similar dingy tarnish, like she was wearing greenish-grey makeup. Both faces bore the same resting-bitch-face scowl as Ms. Liberty.

The queen turned slightly to her right, smashed through the left-side guard rail, and ran onto the highway. I slammed on the brakes and slid to a stop in the center of the road. The queen continued her strange, arhythmic, loping run, rapidly moving away from me down the center of the road.

The face on the 180-degree rear of the queen’s head looked directly at me and shouted something I could not hear from inside Castle’s cab. She slowed to a jog, and then a complete stop. Behind her, the road opened into a parking lot. A park-sign-brown sign on the side of the road announced that the road ended at Rankate Park.

We stayed there, staring at each other. Me, sitting in the cab, listening to Castle’s insane German Industrial Metal. A hundred yards ahead, at the entrance to the Rankate parking lot, the 20-foot-tall, many-limbed, eight-faced queen stared back at me. Behind her, the paved parking lot ended at what looked like an observation area overlooking the ocean, a hundred feet or so below us.

*…Make bad decisions…*

Kevin’s voice floated through my consciousness. A demented, acid-trip version of Obi-Wan telling Luke to use The Force.

I could try ramming her, I thought. The truck is really powerful, so that might be a good idea. No, I mentally corrected myself, I need bad ideas, not good ones.

We stared at each other for three or four songs. From time to time she would turn her head slightly so that another face would have a chance to glare at me. But other than the dirty looks, she did nothing. It must be my move.

I looked around the cab of Castle’s truck. Was there anything here that could help me? Some clue as to how this weird world behaved? I didn’t see anything other than what I assumed was the usual trucker stuff: maps, coffee cups, a clipboard with some kind of cargo manifest. What kind of cargo was Castle hauling, anyway? Is there, like, an economy here? Was he making a delivery? I grabbed the clipboard and tried to make sense of it. It was just a list of coded and abbreviated items: PT, CF, 1 gross, pallet.

I unbuckled my seatbelt and cracked the driver’s door open. The queen didn’t move. I opened the door and swung myself out onto the footplate. Nothing from the queen. I jumped down to the pavement, still focused on the queen. She turned her head to glare at me with a new face, but was otherwise motionless.

I walked to the back of the truck, and scrambled up the metal bars that functioned as the trailer’s rear bumper. I fumbled with the door handle for a bit, but finally got the door to swing open. I scrambled inside. I had to open the second door to let enough light in to see the cargo clearly. Castle was hauling about ten pallets of Cosmic Fudge flavored Pop Tarts.

I strolled the length of the trailer interior to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. I wasn’t. Just ten pallets of Pop Tarts – all Cosmic Fudge flavored – and pallet jack lashed to the wall.

*Bad decisions*. I needed bad ideas to make bad decisions. I thought. Nothing came to mind. I stopped thinking and just acted. I unlashed the pallet jack from the trailer wall and rolled it to doorway. I slid the tines under the pallet next to the door and pushed it to the edge of the trailer. It didn’t weight much – a gross of crates of Pop Tarts is only a hundred-fifty pounds or so. I maneuvered the pallet so it was hanging off the edge of the trailer, slid the jack out, and then pushed hard on the load of plastic-wrapped Pop-Tart boxes. The pallet of Pop Tarts rolled out of the truck and spilled onto the road.

I worked the pallet jack under the next pallet and did the same thing. I thought I heard a gasp, or maybe a shout from the queen. I worked quickly, pushing the rest of the pallets out of the truck. I expected to see the queen’s huge, eight-faced head appear in the doorway at any moment, ready to take me out. But she didn’t show up. It was still my move.

I hopped down from the trailer and walked back to the cab. The Queen was still in her position by the Rankate Park sign. Still glaring at me.

“What do you think you are doing!” she shouted from the face that was most-directly looking at me. “I’ll have your head for this!” Her voice was not what I expected. I thought she would sound “Queen like” – she’d have a snobby upper-class British accent. But she was American. From Boston, maybe?

I climbed into the cab and put the truck into gear. This time, I knew what I was doing and I didn’t have any embarrassing stall outs. I rolled the truck forward about fifty feet.

The queen began shouting again. I couldn’t hear what she said. I figured out how to turn off the Castle’s heavy metal music and I opened the driver’s window. “What?” I shouted back?

“You pathetic pawn. Just because you stole a truck, it doesn’t mean you’re a rook. I’ll bite your head off!”

I leaned out the window to make sure she’d hear me. “You mean, you’d actually chew on my head? That’s pretty gross!”

“It’s a figure of speech, pawny pants!” There was that stupid insult again. “But this one,” she used three of her arms to point at the face on the left side of her head, “she’s a little bit off, you know. She might actually do it!”

I put the truck into reverse and rolled it backwards towards the pile of Pop Tarts.

“My Tarts!” the Queen screamed. “My Tarts! Stop! You’ll ruin them!”

I smiled and kept rolling slightly backwards. *Your move*, I thought. I had a bad feeling about my plan. But it was a familiar bad feeling. The same feeling I had just before I attended my cousin’s super-formal wedding barefoot. Or when I tried to arm-wrestle the bouncer at O’Flanagan’s. Or when I did a million other stupid things. I was doing what came naturally – making bad decisions.

The Queen launched herself into a sprint directly at the truck. If you’ve got six or eight legs, you can really get some good acceleration. She screamed at me, literally and figuratively, as she rushed the truck.

For a moment, I thought she was going to take me out. And that she was going to do it in a much more violent and bloody way than I did when I took out Castle. I’d have to face oblivion, lying on the road next to the park. But she didn’t take me out. She raced past the cab – the face on the right side of her head spit at me as she passed – and stopped at rear of the trailer.

“My Tarts!” she screamed again.

The truck stopped rolling backwards. I looked in the driver-side mirror and saw the Queen leaning into the trailer, pushing it forwards, away from the tarts, with all the force she had in her collection of sixteen limbs.

I put the truck in a forward gear and stomped on the gas. I rolled forward slowly at first, then faster and faster. In the mirror, the Queen fell behind as the truck moved away from the pile of her precious Pop Tarts.

I shifted gears, then shifted again. I blasted past the Rankate Park sign with the engine screaming. I accelerated through the parking lot, towards the observation point. A sign that said “Viewing area. Caution, steep drop off” was planted directly in front of me.

*Make Bad Decisions*

I flattened the sign and kept the truck rolling forward. Through the safety railing and into the void beyond.

For a moment, the cab stayed level as it flew off the cliff. Then it pitched downwards as the forces of gravity and the cantilever of the trailer the trailer rolled me towards the ocean below. I saw the dark water churning at the base of a rocky cliff. *The Black Edge of the Board*, I thought.

Then I was standing on the ground. I was in park’s viewing area looking out over the ocean as the truck crashed onto the rocks below and rolled into the surf.

I felt dizzy. I took a step back from edge. Eight legs moved me in a coordinated but inhuman motion to where I wanted to be. “Wha….” I began to speak, and heard eight different versions of my voice.

I remembered my conversation with Kevin at the party. Only hours ago:

*“Chess, right?” Kevin had said. “You know what happens when a pawn makes it to the other side?”*

*“Yeah, it turns into a queen. The most badass piece on the board.”*

Pawn Promotion. I had been promoted. I was a …

I looked at my arms – all eight of them. I was a [Queen](https://www.anewkindofmonster.com/).
