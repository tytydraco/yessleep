Introduction: Discovery of the Erebus Explorer

On the 19th of May, 2083, the rescue ship Hercules arrived at the coordinates of the Erebus Explorer, a ship that had been missing for nearly three weeks. The distress signal from the Erebus had gone dark after an initial report, and all communication had ceased. When we arrived at Kepler-186f, we found the landing site abandoned, the remains of the crew scattered around the wreckage of their ship. It was clear that something had gone terribly wrong.

The ship was grounded, its hull heavily damaged by what appeared to be external force. The environment was strangely calm—too calm—almost oppressive in its stillness. The surrounding area was covered in what looked like dense, unnatural growths, shimmering black spires protruding from the ground in sharp angles. No signs of a struggle, no sign of violence, except for the strange, glassy surface of the spires, which seemed to hum faintly with an energy we couldn’t identify.

As we approached the wreckage, we found remnants of the crew’s equipment, scattered across the ground in a haphazard manner. A half-buried communicator was the first sign we found of life, but the logs were corrupted. There was no obvious trace of any survivors, but we quickly discovered a series of digital logs left behind by the crew—personal accounts, mission logs, and emergency protocols. They had tried to warn us.

What follows is a collection of these recovered mission logs and crew accounts, pieced together from what we could salvage. The data was fragmented, corrupted, and some parts were entirely erased. We’ve done our best to present their final hours in full, as chilling as they are—an account of human arrogance, isolation, and the terror of discovering that we are not alone.

Mission Logs and Crew Accounts


---

Mission Log - Captain Elena Vargas - Day 1 (Initial Landing)
Date: 15 April, 2083
“We’ve arrived on Kepler-186f. The planet is exactly as the data predicted—habitable, stable atmosphere, and we’ve already begun setting up camp. The land seems... too perfect. There’s something unnerving about it. Not a single sign of life, but the readings show the presence of unusual minerals. Tomorrow, we begin the extraction. The team is in good spirits, though there’s some tension from Darius and Isaac—something about the ship’s condition that’s been bothering them. It’s nothing we can’t manage. We’ll get the job done.”

Crew Account - Dr. Malik Patel - Day 3 (Discovery of the Spires)
Date: 17 April, 2083
“I found something today. While scanning the area for flora and fauna samples, I stumbled upon a set of... spires. They're unlike anything I've ever seen. The composition doesn’t match anything native to this planet. They’re black and reflective, almost metallic. Sofia thinks they’re naturally occurring, but I’m not so sure. They hum faintly, a low vibration. I’m taking samples back to camp for analysis. Something about them feels off. I can’t explain it.”

Mission Log - Captain Elena Vargas - Day 5 (The Disappearance of Malik)
Date: 19 April, 2083
“We’ve encountered our first real problem. Malik disappeared last night. One minute he was fine, obsessively working with his samples, and the next, gone. We’ve searched the entire area, but there’s no sign of him. It’s like he vanished into thin air. The worst part is—his equipment was still on. His tools left untouched. His data logs don’t show anything abnormal. It's as if he just… walked away.”


---

Crew Account - Isaac Chen - Day 6 (Malik's Return)
Date: 20 April, 2083
“I don’t know what happened to Malik. I don’t know how to explain it. He came back today. He was standing by the spires, staring at them. When we called to him, he didn’t respond. He just stood there, like he was... waiting. When we finally managed to pull him away, his eyes were different. His pupils were dilated, and there was a strange, glassy quality to his stare. We tried to get him back to the ship, but he wasn’t Malik anymore. Something in him was... wrong.”


---

Mission Log - Captain Elena Vargas - Day 7 (Malik’s Transformation)
Date: 21 April, 2083
“Malik attacked us today. He wasn’t the man we knew. His body had changed—his limbs elongated, his skin became hard and reflective, like the spires themselves. When we tried to subdue him, he became violent. We had to lock him in the medbay. Darius and Isaac are... shaken. Darius wants to leave immediately, but I can’t abandon him. I’m still trying to reach out to HQ, but communication is down. There’s no signal. It’s just us now.”


---

Crew Account - Sofia Reyes - Day 9 (The Growth of the Organisms)
Date: 23 April, 2083
“I don’t know what we’re dealing with anymore. The organisms Malik was studying, they’ve grown exponentially. I’ve watched them multiply under the microscope, changing shape, glowing brighter. They’re no longer just microscopic—they’re alive in ways I can’t understand. We tried to burn them, but they spread faster. There’s no way to destroy them. We’re being overrun by something we can’t even comprehend.”


---

Mission Log - Captain Elena Vargas - Day 11 (The Lake)
Date: 25 April, 2083
“The lake—it’s glowing. At night, it pulses with an eerie light. Sofia and I went to investigate today, and what we found... I can’t describe it. There’s something beneath the surface, something that moves, like it’s alive. The air feels thicker near the water, and every step we take sends a ripple through the ground. I swear I can hear it calling. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but now… now, I’m not so sure.”


---

Crew Account - Darius Cole - Day 12 (Final Stand)
Date: 26 April, 2083
“We have to leave. It’s not safe here anymore. Malik isn’t the only one who’s changed. The creatures from the spires—they’re coming. I can hear them moving through the trees, their clicking growing louder. I’m not sure if they’re the same creatures Malik was studying, or something worse. The ship is compromised—something has torn through the hull. It’s like they’re trying to get in. I don’t know how much longer we have. Elena, if you find this, you have to leave. Save yourself.”


---

Mission Log - Captain Elena Vargas - Day 13 (Last Transmission)
Date: 27 April, 2083
“We’re done. The ship is falling apart. I’ve lost Sofia, Isaac, and Darius. I don’t know if they’re dead or… something else. They don’t look human anymore. I’ve locked myself in the cockpit. The creatures—they’re everywhere, tapping at the hull, scratching at the windows. The spires have come to life. They’re moving, growing. The air is thick with their presence. They’re trying to communicate, but I can’t understand. I just wanted to explore. To prove we could survive out here. I never thought we would be the ones to vanish. I never thought we would be the experiment.”

End of Transmission

Recovery Notes:
The data logs recovered were severely corrupted, with several sections completely erased. The final transmission from Captain Elena Vargas was the last recorded entry from the Erebus Explorer. Rescue teams sent to the coordinates found the wreckage, but no bodies were ever recovered. The area remains under quarantine, and all attempts to re-enter the planet have been unsuccessful. The spires continue to pulse, their hum carrying a chilling resonance.

We are unsure if the Erebus crew truly perished or if they’ve become part of something far darker.
