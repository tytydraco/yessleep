My job is *far* from glamorous. I stock the shelves, ring up customers, and clean every so often. It's brutally simple, almost mind-numbingly so at times, but it pays the bills and lets me stay overseas, so it's not *all* bad. 

The customers are the best part for me. I don't like people, by nature- I would rather spend my time alone. Even still, you start to build a relationships and rapport with them, seein' as you ring them up three times a day *every day*. It's a small base and a tight-knit community that I serve and you get to know people whether you like it or not. 

Dan was one of my favorites. He was tall, built like a brick shithouse, handsome as fuck. But, more importantly, he was *kind*. The kinda guy that would ask you how your day was (and really care) even though he was going through his tenth consecutive 12-hour shift, or his big important project fell through, or his only help at the office just quit- you get the idea. 

Bad shit happened to him, just like anyone else, but he would still stop and try to brighten your day. He certainly made the mundanity of work that much less painful.

That's why it was so hard on me when he went missing. I remember it all too clearly- he he said something about going on leave for a few weeks- said he'd be driving his sexy as fuck muscle car down to the coast of Italy. I sold him his daily bottle of wine, diet coke, and coffee-flavored Zyn, wished him a safe trip, and he was gone. 

Then, a few months after he went AWOL, he showed up while I was closing up shop. I was knee-deep in coke bottles trying to top off the cooler when I heard the door open. 

  
“Simon!” he called happily, and I jolted backwards so fast I fell on my ass. 

  
“Dan?!” I asked, fully flustered. I hauled myself to my feet and rushed over to him. I moved to give him a hug, like was normal between us, but he shuffled back with a sad smile. 

  
“Dude, everybody’s been lookin’ *everywhere* for you,” I said frantically. I eyed him up and down, and he looked totally, completely fine. 

  
“I told you ages ago,” he said with a shrug, “I was on leave. I just got back.”

  
I shook my head dumbly, eyes a little wide. “Yeah, but dude, you were *missing*. Does anyone else even know you’re back?”

  
Dan shrugged once again. “Like I said. Just got back.” He gave me an easy smile as if this wasn’t the most bizarre thing in the world. 

  
I nodded slowly. “Uh, right. Well, uh, how was the trip? How did your car handle the drive?”

  
Dan laughed, the sound filling the frigid cooler air with warmth. “Handled like a dream, up until it got wrapped around a tree down by the Amalfi Coast.”

  
My jaw literally dropped. “…What?” I whispered after a moment. Dan’s car was his life. His pride and joy. His most prized possession. How was he so… casual right now? “You’re kidding, right?” I pressed. 

  
He sighed, the warmth of his laughter dissipating. “Nah, man, it was fuckin’ brutal. I took a turn too fast and skidded off the road. Poor thing’s still in a ditch. Don’t think anyone found it.”

  
My words caught in my throat and I scrambled for something- anything to say. “Fuck, Dan, I’m so sorry. Are you… *okay*, though?”

  
He gave me a sad smile and shook his head. He opened his mouth, as if to say something, but just as he did, my supervisor popped into the cooler and asked me to mop. 

  
I glanced at her and nodded absently at her, and when I turned my head back around, Dan was gone. 

  
I mulled over this interaction for ages that night. I checked in with my supervisor and coworker after the fact- they looked at me like I grew a second head when I asked if they’d seen Dan that night. 

  
“Of course I didn’t,” Anna said, her face pinched in confusion. “You *do* know he’s missing, right?”

  
I forced back a sigh and nodded along. “Right. Yeah. Was just wondering if he ever showed up again.”

  
My supervisor shook her head sadly, locked up, and we parted ways for the evening. 

  
The next morning, I saw a FaceBook post about Dan. It listed a number where you could leave a message if you had any information. I called it and left an anonymous tip to look for Dan and his car off the Amalfi Coast, and one week later, news of his death spread through base.

“I can’t believe it,” Anna said. She sniffled and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue. I gave her a pat on the shoulder, trying (and failing) to stifle my own tears. 

  
The grief, in a way, was easier to deal with than the utter confusion I felt. I had seen Dan, in the flesh, just a *week* ago, and the reports say he crashed his car *two* weeks ago. I bit my lip so hard it bled and blamed my general distress on Dan’s death.   


  
The next customer was one I genuinely hated. He was Martin- a short, fat, balding man that always bugged me with the most irritating requests while I was balls deep in a chore. 

  
This time, I had a bucket of 3 gallons of Slushee juice hefted over my shoulder when he stopped me to ask a question. 

  
“Are you guys gonna make more hotdogs today?” he asked, and I groaned internally and shifted my grip on the bucket. 

  
“Uh, maybe. We can, if you don’t mind waiting,” I grunted out, trying my best to be professional. 

  
“Oh. Okay. Well, you know, they really aren’t good for me, but I just can’t help myself.”

  
I nodded, gritting my teeth in irritation. “Yeah, no kidding.” The bucket was cutting into my shoulder uncomfortably. 

  
Martin continued speaking, much to my dismay. “Yeah. Gonna give me a heart attack, I swear. But they’re just so good.”

  
I nodded again and slipped a tight smile on my face. “Uh. *Yep*.” I took a step away, trying to communicate that I was done with the conversation. 

  
“I mean, it happened already, you know.”

  
I paused and raised an eyebrow. “Uh… really?”

  
Martin nodded. “Yep. Last night at my house, actually.”

  
My eyebrows shot upwards. “What the *fu*\- heck? Do you need to go to the hospital, sir? Should I call someone?”

  
He shrugged blandly, his wide, pig-like face devoid of emotion. “Too late for that.”

  
Dumbstruck, I set the bucket on the floor, and by the time I looked back up, he was gone without a trace.   
Another Facebook post popped up later that day. I left a comment asking if anyone had gone to his house to check on him, and I was far from surprised to later hear that he had died from a heart attack that night.   
Honestly, at that point, I was questioning my sanity. Of *course* I was, though, like can you *blame* me? I had spoken to two people who were apparently dead, and nobody else saw them, and they gave me super fuckin’ important information about what happened to them. 

  
I struggled a lot after that. I was never sure if the person I was talking to was real and actually living. I checked FaceBook near-obsessively, always on the lookout for any other possible disappearances. It was kind of unhealthy, really, but each day without a new “missing person” post only made my unease grow. 

  
I eventually stopped checking. I let the obsession slip out of my mind, and carried on with life.

Until the General stopped by for a visit for the first time in ages. 

  
He was one of many generals I spoke to on a regular basis. Stout, portly, crew-cut hair and wire glasses. Essentially the stereotypical general, if not for the fact that he was so short and round.   


He always- and I mean *always*\- bought two 4-packs of Heineken, nearly nightly, but it had been a long while since I had last seen him. 

  
“Evening, sir,” I said with a pleasant smile. It didn’t matter much to me that he was a general, in all honesty. I wasn’t raised military, didn’t care about rank, and I saw all my customers as regular people. Plus, he was only a one-star. I might’ve started to sweat a bit on principle alone if he was a three. 

  
He nodded at me politely and came to a stop at the register. I perked up a bit at that- he wasn’t ever one to stop and chat. 

  
“Can I help you with anything?” I asked, anxiety beginning to prickle at my scalp. 

  
“Not really,” he said with a shrug, and vaguely charged silence began to fester between us. 

  
“Uh,” I said, and straightened out a wonky pack of cigarettes in the display behind me. “You just went on a trip to Spain, right? I remember you told me about it a few weeks ago.”

  
He nodded with a little smile. “Yep. Sure did. Glad you remembered.”

  
I smiled weakly at him. I always made it a habit to remember those little bits of information when customers supplied them to me. If anything, it was a conversation topic to fill the void when I checked them out, but I also always felt a bit of satisfaction at their positive reactions that I had remembered. Now, though? It felt almost life-or-death. 

  
“Yeah, you showed me some pictures of the town you were visiting. How was it?”

  
The general’s face fell slightly. “It was… fine. The wife and I got into a bit of an argument. She said she hated that I was always at work.”

  
I hummed sympathetically. “Oh. That sucks. She was upset, even though you were literally on vacation with her?”

  
The general sighed. “Yep. Nothing makes her happy these days, I swear. Sitting in a five-star hotel- called the fuckin’ ‘Rosewood Villa Magna’- with the finest wine money can buy, and she still bashed my head in with a lamp.”

   
I swallowed thickly and made a mental note of his words. “Oh. She did?”

  
The general nodded solemnly. “She did. Almost 40 times. Tried to fight back, obviously, but she’s the type of bitch that can’t be stopped when she’s mad.”

  
I let out a long sigh. “Fuck. Pardon my language.”

  
The general snickered at my foul language. “It’s alright. I’m just glad the kids are safe with her parents.”

  
I nodded, deciding it best to play along for as long as possible. “Sure. What did you say your wife’s name was, again?”

  
“Mary,” he said shortly. I always liked how efficient he was during conversation. 

  
I nodded and closed my eyes with a sigh. When they reopened, the general was predictably gone.   


  
“The general went missing,” one of my favourites, Kenny, said. 

  
I cocked my head in mock confusion, already knowing the answer to my question . “Oh yeah? Which one?”

  
“Anderson, the one-star,” Kenny said with a frown. “Last anyone heard, he was out on a trip with the wife.”

  
I nodded thoughtfully. “Yeah, he told me about that a while back. Said he’d been having some troubles with his wife Mary. I think they were staying at the Rosewood Villa Magna in Madrid.”

  
Kenny hummed shortly. “Oh yeah? Don’t think anyone’s heard that. I’ll let his people know.”

  
“You do that,” I replied, and delved into mindless flirting with Kenny as the mood eventually lightened. 

  
A few days later, Kenny whispered to me that Anderson had been found dead, and his wife was at large. I frowned, gave him my sympathies, and carried on with my day. 

  
They found her, four days later, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. I sighed and frowned and cried over the loss, as only felt fitting, and waited patiently for my next post-mortem conversation.

I was never expecting it to be *me*. 

I was on my way home that night. I walked across base and waited for the bus, just like always, when a figure crept into my periferal vision. 

I didn't pay them any mind. I never did, to be honest- I was one of many individuals that waited at this bus stop after dark. The stop was dark, isolated, and commonly skipped over unless you made yourself blatantly known to the oncoming bus driver. Tall dark trees surrounded me, the glow of the streetlamp failing to reach my stop.

I was used to all of this. I was used to the isolation, the darkness. However, the figure inched closer to me, which I certainly wasn't used to.

I gritted my teeth and pretended to be invested in my phone. The figure inched even closer still, and I could no longer feign ignorance. 

"Gib mir deine Brieftasche," the stranger spoke softly but firmly. 

I froze. I had been living in Germany for nearly four years at this point, but I barely spoke a word of the language.

"Uh," I said stiffly, and tried to settle the trembling in my hands. "Sprechen Sie Englisch?" I replied, my pronunciation terrible. 

The stranger sighed harshly and raised their hand. I caught the briefest glimmer of cold steel as a pistol pressed into my temple. 

"Gib mir deine Brieftasche," they said again, more forcefully this time.

"Huh?" I asked in a panic, the world slipping into a haze, and I barely had time to think as a bullet lodged itself into the side of my head.

&#x200B;

"Hey," Kenny said, his eyebrows raised. He seemed almost shocked to see me as I approached him outside the gas station.

"Hey," I replied with a smile. "How you doing?"

Kenny shook his head. He seemed weirdly frazzled as he hastily snuffed out his cig. "Uh. Good, I guess?" He took a step closer to me and I reflexively took a step back. His brow furrowed.

"Where have you been?" he asked softly. "Management is asking about you. You've never been late before, and they're sayin' you're a no-call-no-show."

I didn't really know the answer to that. "Uh. I dunno?" I said with an awkward shrug. "Work's been crazy lately, I guess. Just got done last night, y'know? I was waiting for the bus when I got shot in the side of the head." The words felt almost compulsory, tumbling out of my mouth like it was predestined.

Kenny stared at me blankly for a second. His eyes widened and I frowned in return. 

"Were you waiting for the 24 at the back gate?" he asked after a moment. 

"Sure was," I replied. "That's the only line that stops there, right? There was some freak yappin' at me in German, though. I think the stupid fucker dragged my body into the woods and bolted."

Kenny nodded slowly. "Huh. Alright. I'll let your supervisor know, then."

I gave him a warm smile. "Cool. Thanks, dude. I probably won't be in tomorrow. Or ever again."

Kenny put on a brave face and nodded back. "Sure. Good to see you again."

I gave him a smile that he never saw. He closed his eyes tightly with a deep, shuddering breath, and I disappeared into the wind.
