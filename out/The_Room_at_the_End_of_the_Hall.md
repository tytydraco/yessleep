After the birth of our daughter, sleep became a luxury. Every night, her cries pierced the silence, and we chalked it up to colic, following the doctor’s advice to the letter. But the medicine didn't help. My husband and I spent night after night in a desperate routine of rocking, shushing, and pacing. Her cries never stopped, and as new parents, we didn’t know what else to do.

We live in India, where it’s customary for babies to sleep in the same room as their parents, so every night, she slept between us. My husband is the most loving father I could imagine. He’d always wanted a daughter, and he adored her more than anything. But one night, she was particularly inconsolable, and my husband had an important meeting the next morning. I insisted he get some rest, assuring him I could handle our daughter for the night.

I took her to the room at the far end of our apartment. This room was different from the rest of the house—secluded, quiet, and eerily detached. As soon as I entered, something strange happened: she stopped crying. Her sudden calmness was unsettling, but I was too exhausted to question it. I put her to bed, relieved that she was finally sleeping. For the first time in weeks, I felt a glimmer of hope that the worst might be over. I, too, drifted off into a deep sleep.

But at 2 a.m., I was jerked awake by the sound of rustling. It sounded like someone was going through the bags of baby supplies we’d stored in the room. In my drowsy state, I assumed it was my husband and drifted back to sleep. But then I remembered—he was in the other room.

I shot up, heart pounding. The room was dark, and the only sound was my own ragged breathing. I switched on the light, but there was nothing there. My daughter was still asleep, her little chest rising and falling steadily. I tried to shake off the unease, telling myself it was just my imagination, and forced myself back to sleep.

Around 3 a.m., I felt it—a presence at the door. The bed was positioned so that the headboard was near the door, and I could feel something standing just behind me. A cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt a long, thin hand reaching over me toward my daughter. I tried to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. In a panic, I leapt up and turned on the light. Again, nothing. My baby was still there, sleeping soundly.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed my husband. I stumbled out of the room, clutching my daughter, but he wasn’t in the house. His phone lay on the bedside table, but there was no sign of him anywhere. I was alone. Terrified, I cradled my daughter and waited for morning, holding her close until I finally passed out from sheer exhaustion.

I woke to the cries of my daughter, my husband was standing by the bed, a look of deep concern on his face. I was still holding my daughter tightly and she was whispering like she was tired of crying. I asked him where he had been, but he just stared at me, his face pale. “I’ve been here the whole time,” he said. “But... there’s something you need to see.”

He led me back to the room at the end of the hall. Everything was as I left it—except for one thing. In the crib, which we had bought for our daughter, lay an old, tattered doll. Its eyes were open wide, staring blankly at the ceiling, its hand outstretched toward the door.

And suddenly, I realized...my daughter wasn’t crying anymore.
