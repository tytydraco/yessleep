*When I opened my eyes I was on the ground, not where I’d fallen asleep. I found myself back in the middle of the open basement. Sitting upright I wondered how I could’ve moved myself so far without waking up, I’d never been one to sleepwalk.*

*There was something new now: a smell. I realized that throughout everything I hadn’t noticed anything distinct until now. I surely would have noticed this before if it had been there at least.*

*It was strong. A stench that I felt might even stick to my clothing if I didn’t get out of it soon. I hadn’t ever experienced it before, but it was like I’d left fruit around and let it rot, almost sweet. To make the scene better, I started to hear it again. That scraping.*

*I did a complete 180 trying to find the source of the noise, but I was alone. It ended just as quickly as it’d begun, like something decided to give me a glance over before deciding what to do with me.*

*I was now acutely aware that I was dreaming, and that Catherine was not in the basement with me, but something else was. I knew I was being stalked; watched. I also now knew that even though it was a dream, everything I was seeing was real.*

*After a moment it picked up again. Slow. Even. Scrapes that made my body tense.*

*My attention then drew to the door I hadn’t been able to open. It was closed. The scraping drew nearer, but I still couldn’t place its source. I knew something was about to bear down on me however, and my thoughts grew restless. Something was going to kill me, and I had no way to see it or defend myself. I was going to die. I remember thinking: Would anyone even find my body? What would happen to Catherine? All thoughts ended abruptly as the scraping ceased. I was left in silence apart from the beating of my own heart, which felt like it would fall from my chest at a moment’s notice. Something compelled me to turn around.*

*I came face to face with my assailant. It was touching noses with me. I stepped back, witness now to what I somehow knew had been down here all along. Now staring at it in the dim light, my body felt numb. I was no longer afraid, but there was nothing to replace it. I felt like I was staring back into the gap between the door and the darkness beyond it. There was nothing I could do, and hopelessness wasn’t even worth feeling. Things were so out of my control that there was no real use in even trying to fight. What was I doing trying to escape?*

*Then I was warm. Calm. I could’ve stood to lose myself in the feeling, but I shook myself free of it. I couldn’t give in to that, I was interested in a way out, not comfort from not being able to find it. I told myself I would find it, if not for me then for her.*

*I turned my attention back to the thing. It dripped a liquid I couldn’t see well enough to identify as it towered over me. There aren’t many things I have to look up at to see clearly, but this thing had me craning my neck to get a good glimpse.*

*“Lighten.”*

*It commanded my attention. Trying to turn away was pointless as I felt I couldn’t move my body. I was frozen; forced to stare my death in the face without the choice to fight. Without even being able to feel the fear.*

*I then had the chance to study its features, the ones I could discern in the low light anyway. As I scanned its mostly round body, I found that I hadn’t really gotten a good look at the thing at all. If I had, I’m sure I wouldn’t have missed the faces I saw embedded in it. All of them looked to be in different states of fear or pain, like they’d been alive as they'd meshed together to make the thing that was speaking to me. I could also make out a few arms hanging limp, one or two fused by the flesh at the wrist and shoulder. I gathered that the thing must move around with the two that jutted out awkwardly ahead, boxing me in with it. They lacked defining muscle mass, and if I hadn’t watched the fingers twitch before me then, I would’ve never known they were part of a living creature.*

*It had no eyes. I was aware of that. I knew it only saw me now because I was in this dream.*

*In terms of speaking, I couldn’t place a mouth that had moved from what I was seeing ahead of me. So, it had no real mouth, or one I could see at least; but I was hearing it so clearly. Again, the fear I was expecting to wash over me never came. I was indifferent to what I was seeing.*

*I wasn’t. I wasn’t anything. My body relaxed, and the muscles in my neck ached from the struggle I’d gone through trying to turn my head away the entire time. It was giving me a choice, I understood then. I found my voice again.*

*“I want to go home.”*

*Silence. Its knuckles raised. It began to move forward.*

I shot up, truly awake, beside Catherine on the landing. My vision swam as I reached out to the sides of me to find my bearings in the dim light. I remembered the feelings, or lack of, I’d had before waking up, and still found myself numb. I couldn’t figure out why, not for lack of trying, but it was almost like I simply couldn’t feel. Emotions were locked behind some foggy wall in my mind. I felt as though I could reach in and touch them, but the feelings would never come over me.

Cathy stirred immediately, attempting to get on her feet, but fell back onto the staircase up to the door.

“Ha... What happened? You okay?” She rubbed her eyes furiously with one hand while putting the other out ahead of her. Once her eyes were open, she glanced from me to the open air around us and sighed. “What the fuck Adrian.”

She placed a hand on her chest and tilted her head up to breathe. “That scared the shit outta me…”

“Sorry,” I spat “awful dream.”

“Must have been. You jumped pretty bad.”

I glanced away. “And you?”

“Did I dream?”

I nodded.

“Nope. I basically shut my eyes and opened them. I feel like I haven’t slept at all actually.”

I didn’t know if I would’ve preferred that. “I think I saw that thing the guy was dreaming about down here.”

“What?”

I opened my mouth to explain, but the sound of a door slamming shut below stopped me. Everything was silent in the few moments that followed, the flickering from the lamps even seemed to die out. Before I could even think of releasing my breath and try reasoning out what we had just heard, the scraping began. I tensed. They were the same scrapes that I’d heard in my dream. I couldn’t believe our luck. The thing was real. I hadn’t even had the chance to say it to her.

I turned to Cathy, who had stiffened. She had to have no idea what was going on or what was about to happen. I didn’t either, but at least I’d already seen the thing. I knew we’d definitely have no chance if it decided to move up the stairs. We were going to have to go back down. Cathy’s eyes were wide, boring holes into me as I leaned in to whisper in her ear. It came out as barely a croak.

“I need you to follow me as closely and quietly as you can. Okay?”

Feeling her nod against my cheek, she gripped the collar of my shirt. I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine, that there was something more we could look through or a key I had just misplaced in my pocket, but then figured what good was telling her that when I was having trouble believing it myself.

The scraping had gotten a little softer, leaving me to assume it’d gone down the hall to the lectern room. It was a perfect time for us to get down and hide. Trying to think of anything that might help, I remembered the power tools I’d found while we were searching earlier. I hadn’t seen if there was anything useful, but that was before I’d needed anything to get the door open. Maybe there was a crowbar or something I could use to just pry the thing off its hinges. Maybe that was a long stretch, but it was the best idea I could come up with at the time.

I pulled back and gestured for her to follow me. Taking a risk, I was hoping that the thing’s lack of eyes in my dream meant that in reality it couldn’t see me. Something told me I had the right idea as we carefully made our way down into the open basement. From the bottom of the steps there was a clear view down the hall to the lectern, and as we got to it, I heard the air catch in Catherine’s throat. I spun, her hands flying up to her mouth as I saw her gaze fix on the thing at the end of the hall. Tears welled in her eyes, and I turned to look as well.

There it was, arms outstretched, a trail of mystery liquid trailing behind it in large amounts as it pulled itself about the space. The smell had returned as well, and I heard a faint gurgle from Catherine’s throat. I shook my head slowly. Again, while I was staring at this thing, now in my actual reality, I felt little more than indifference. I decided that this wasn’t worth exploring now and grabbed Cathy’s remaining hand to pull her down the rest of the steps. Standing and staring wasn’t going to get us out, but I couldn’t blame her.

I led us over to the crates, feeling the need to glance back at the opening to the hall frequently. I still didn’t know if the thing could see us, and I definitely didn’t want to find out how well it could hear by moving too quickly. When we got to the crate I was looking for, I let go of her and leaned in to look at its contents again. Drills, but no bits that would do us any good. Small, handheld saws, but rusted to hell and missing teeth sporadically. They weren’t going to cut through anything. The smell of the sack seemed to mix with that of the rest of the basement. I unfolded the top and reached my hand in without looking, horrified by the sudden feeling of coarse hair between my fingers. I froze but fear never took hold. I wanted to feel, even though I knew I would’ve been terrified. We never had seen what was at the end of that logbook. I reflexively squeezed my hand closed and felt a piece of paper amidst the hair. I tightened my hand around it, trying not to think too hard about the state of the body inside.

Trying to keep a gag stifled, I thrust my hand back out of the sack. I held it out ahead of me, squeezing my eyes shut as I tried convincing myself that I’d touched anything other than the corpse of the homeless man. It didn’t work, and my skin crawled as I turned my palm up and gazed at the note that laid in it. Unfolding it slowly, I strained my eyes and held it up to get a good look at what was written.

Fuck you.

I threw the note aside, useless. My gut was still hopeful that there was something we could use in there, but that would mean I had to stick my hand back in. I wasn’t looking to do that. If there was seriously nothing, then escape was hopeless. I didn’t want to just give up.

Glancing up at Catherine, I found her with her hands clasped together, lips moving silently as she stared at the doorway. I decided she wasn’t going to be any help and I was going to just have to pray my gut feeling was right. Biting my tongue to keep from gagging, I went back in. I left my hand balled in a fist as I felt past the distinct ridges of bones and instances of what I hoped wasn’t skin falling from it. I had to be careful as I moved down so as to not disturb them or cause everything to suddenly fall apart. I assumed the flesh that held things together now was in danger of coming undone at any moment. I stretched my fingers out cautiously, something damp coming into contact with me. My throat suddenly felt numb, and I was finding it a little difficult to still take breaths without heaving.

Suddenly Catherine ducked by my side. I hadn’t noticed until then, but the scraping was much louder than before. It had made its way back into the open room with us. My other arm found its way around Catherine’s waist, and I pulled her as close as I could. It was the only comfort I could afford her at the time. My breaths became deep and even, silent as I listened. Cathy held her hands over her mouth, eyes squeezed shut.

The sound grew closer, and a moment later I saw a hand land on the floor beside us. The fingers twitched, growing tense as it readied to heave the rest of its mass forward. Once it was positioned in front of our spot, it stopped moving. I closed my eyes, certain this would mean the end for us both, but when the sound of scraping came again, I reopened them to find the thing had moved past us. I couldn’t believe it; I’d been right.

With newfound confidence I let go of Catherine and dug my hand further down in the sack, touching the wet bottom. It was sopping from what I could feel, and I wished I had the ability to shrug the discomfort away. The scrapes were still close but were getting further. I knew it was looking for us, but then wondered what it would do if it got a hold of Catherine or me. I could have given this much more thought, but it was overshadowed entirely by a new feeling beneath my fingers. Metal.

I grabbed whatever I’d found and reclaimed my arm. It fell over, smacking the side of the crate with a loud thud that sounded through the space like a gunshot. The scraping stopped abruptly. I looked to Catherine, and found her staring back at me, eyes wide, face pale, and held up the object between my fingers.

A key.

I grabbed Catherine’s hand and shot up. The scraping had started again, a bit faster-paced than before. I couldn’t see it yet, but I knew it was going to be on us soon. I found Cathy by my feet still, so I tugged her hand up to urge her on with me. She took a moment, but ultimately stood. I had to drag her forward, ushering us along as I now had no regard for the amount of noise we were making. I had our ticket out.

The scraping picked up, causing Cathy to break from her stupor. “What the fuck is that thing?”

“How should I fucking know? C’mon, you gotta move faster.” I shoved her ahead of me as we made it to the steps, and we both took them two at a time. With her now ahead I was going to have to reach past her to get the key in the lock.

It was now that the fear began returning to me. Instead of coming on gradually, it hit me all at once. My nose stung, my heart pounded, and I felt like I might die. Despite this, we made it to the door, but we didn’t hurry to get it open until I heard the distinct sound of the thing’s large palms slapping against the ground.

I turned. To my horror, it was already at the landing.

I turned again, anxiety spreading like fire through me. I scrambled to hold the key straight and pushed Catherine aside to get to the door. My hands were shaking so badly I thought I’d drop it if I didn’t take my time. Time was something I knew I didn’t have, so I fought through the shakiness.

Cathy gripped my arm tight, and I heard her sniffle while muttering a prayer. I can’t stand to imagine, even now, what was going through her mind at that moment.

Then, I heard the door lock click. I grabbed her, not bothering to turn and see how close the thing had gotten before forcing my shoulder into the door and falling through with my partner in tow. We both hit the ground just outside, and I forced the door back shut without a second thought. Something wailed against it just behind. Cathy sat a few feet ahead of me, eyes unmoving from the door. The ring of keys was just on the hook beside me, so I grabbed it, shoved the rusty one back in, and turned until I heard another satisfying click.

The banging ceased immediately.

I spun the key off the hook and set the rest of the ring back where I’d grabbed it. I took a step back, finding my place beside Catherine before getting on my knees. “I think…” I glanced from the door to her. “I think it’s over.”

“What do we even do about that?”

I couldn’t help but laugh. After everything she somehow had it in her mind that this was something she had to deal with. I found myself looking at the door again. The insanity of that idea had me reeling. I mean, what the fuck did she think she was gonna do? It must’ve been funny to her as well, because after a few moments Cathy started to chuckle with me.

“What am I saying?”

“I dunno, but I think we take the keys and leave.”

“Leave? Where?”

“I dunno. Home? Forget about all of this, get rid of these keys, and never mention this to anyone.”

She seemed to think about it, taking hold of my arm and pulling herself close. “Just forget about everything?”

“Try to. I don’t know if I’ll forget that thing.”

She was quiet for a moment. “Did you see how close it got?”

I hadn’t, but the thought of what she must’ve thought as it climbed up towards us kept me silent. We shared a few more quiet breaths before she jumped to attention. “What time is it?”

It then occurred to me that we very well could’ve been down in that basement all night, maybe even well into the next day, and I still wasn’t hearing anyone in the store. I shook my head unknowingly, standing as she jumped to her feet and dashed into the kitchen. It hardly mattered to me at that point whether I was going to keep my job as a fry cook or not.

“No way.”

“What?”

No response. I walked out to the front to see Catherine at the register, mouth agape. “Catherine, what’s wrong?”

“It’s midnight.”

“We were down there the whole day? Jesus Christ. No one came in?”

“No Adrian, midnight midnight. Like, today.”

“I’m not following.”

“We went down there around 10 on the 16th, it’s midnight now. It’s the 17th. We were only down there for 2 hours.”

I shook my head, that couldn’t have been right. The entire ordeal at the door we’d just fought to get through felt like 2 hours on its own. Either we had seriously moved quickly and didn’t catch any sleep, or there was something wrong with time down there. Opting to not explore that line of thought, I just kept shaking my head.

“You know what. I don’t care. I’m leaving.”

“What?”

“I’m leaving.” I began to walk towards the back to grab my things when I called back to her “You’re welcome to join me if you want, but just know I’m not coming back.”

I gathered my things just as quickly as I’d laid them out, and upon returning to the front room I found Catherine with her things, waiting for me by the door. I wanted to smile, but after everything it felt in-genuine, so I just nodded towards the lot.

The drive out we shared in silence. I went 55. I didn’t bother to ask about dates or her interests or what kind of coffee she liked. I couldn’t find it in me to care. There were so many things I wanted to know, but I swore then I’d never go back down in that basement. Even as I recount the story now, I can feel its gaze on me. I can hear its voice rasping through the dim light. I can smell it.

So, all of this to say: If you somehow get your hands on a key, you’ve never seen before and use it to unlock a door, don’t go in. It’s in there. It’s looking for someone, and if you aren’t it, you’re dead.
