Melohi is a creature of a completely unknown origin. It is an anagram for Elohim, the Hebrew name given to the god of Israel. Despite its name, it is not an Anti-Christ. He's more of a mythical creature of sorts. Melohi is the name of a creature with the omniscience of a deity-like entity. He hides in the dormant of other entities and lives naturally in different worlds.

However, you can experience this entity by doing this ritual. And in doing so, you can attain the knowledge of the universe. Any question you have, whether in the past, present, or future, will be in your hands.

You need a few items that should be relatively easy to attain. A chair, 4 or more black candles, Bakhoor incense or other objects of smudging, a mirror, tape or rope, a mostly empty room, and a friend. It is recommended to use rope for a stronger bond, but using white or black tape, however, can harness more energy of the entity, as it symbolizes certain aspects of spirituality. The room needs enough space for all the objects and people to do the ritual correctly.

This ritual can be started at any time, but for the best effect, it should be done between midnight to 4 in the morning. Start by lighting the candles. The more, the better. Place the candles surrounding the mirror. Place the chair as close to both the center of the mirror and the center of the room as possible. Have the friend strap your limbs as tightly to the chair as possible. Ensure there is no room for escape, as the ritual will end in a terrible fate for you. Light the incense and smudge the mirror.

Now, stare into the smudged spot of the mirror. Don't take your eyes off of it. If you hear voices, don't look away. If you see changes in scenery, don't look away. Look at the mirror at all times. If failed, the ritual will end.

If you are plunged into total darkness, the ritual has begun. When I said you'd experience this creature, I meant you'd become it. Melohi has entered your body and is using you as a vessel. But for a great reward. The longer you let it control you, the more knowledge you attain, both from questions you ask and answers to questions you never asked.

Melohi is a lonely creature who only wants to play a game with you. After no more than a minute, a human-like figure will appear in the mirror, who is not you. Melohi is taking the form of something familiar not to scare you. The point of the game is to go as long as possible with Melohi inside you, both of you going back and forth between asking questions and questioning answers. Start by asking a questionâ€”anything you'd like. Melohi will answer it truthfully. Now it is his turn. He will give you a trivia fact, a quote, a piece of information, or other statements that he finds interesting These could be friendly facts, such as Elephants view humans as humans view kittens. However, these could also be disturbing or unpleasant, such as the life span of a sloth is only twenty years. There are only three rules.

1. No matter what he says, don't get agressive with Melohi. This gives him more power.
2. Don't question his abilities. Even if you dance around it, he knows when you think of him highly, or as a fool.
3. Be polite. This is an omniscient entity, after all.

Accounts from people who tried this ritual with a friend said they saw their friend struggle like no man. The pigment of their skin could become pale or red. Their veins pop out. They yell and roar like no human being could yell and roar, which has had reports from neighbors. The friend's job is to stop Melohi from taking control before it's too late.

Accounts from people who have been possessed by Melohi have stated that during the ritual, the feel a sense of normality, and indifference in the room, unless Melohi angers them. However, after the ritual, the feel the most intense ache and pain they have ever felt, worse than that of any virus or flu.

For one or both of you to end the ritual, the phrase, "I have heard what I wanted to hear," must be said three times. You must close your eyes until the entity is gone, or your friend must break the mirror. Be warned, however, as breaking mirrors have been said to have bad luck.

After ending the ritual, it'll be like nothing has happened. Other than the tempering of the objects themselves, everything else will be the same. Doors are still closed or open. Devices are still dead or at the same battery life as they were before. And the time they stayed the same from when you started the ritual.

Don't ever try this ritual again. When done, Melohi will have the same strength over your body as left off. Once broken out of bonds, he is said to take control. He is not malicious and will not use your body for bad intentions. Breaking the rules of the game, or losing control, will send your soul to eternal damnation.
