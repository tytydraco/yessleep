Thanksgiving was on its way, and my mom was trying to convince me to visit. I had been busy with finishing my exams and working my 9 to 5 job. But told her that I would visit this Thanksgiving, and I knew she would be excited.  I hopped in my car and started my way to John Kenny Street (which is a 3-hour long drive.) My mom and I were talking about how much fun it's going to be, and what type of games were going to play, as I drove.

I exited the highway, and joined the town I grew up in. I drove around until I found John Kenny Street. I turned and nostalgia slapped me in the face. Memories came flooding back as I told my mom, "I just turned onto the Street." I said, "I stilled remember this place." I chuckled. I pulled up to the curb and stared at my house, excited to see my mom through the window. But I didn't see her, even though I heard her feet pattered against the floor. "Honey, I don't see you. Are you on the right Street." She asked. I looked back at the pole, that said, John Kenny Street. "Yeah, I am. I'm looking at the house right now." I looked around at the homes and noticed that there were no cars in front of any houses. I peered through the windows of the houses and saw no one. My mind tried to look for an explanation but didn't find one. I decided to step out the car and find out what is going on myself. When I got to the front door of my mom's house, I knocked and I rang the doorbell, but no one came. "I don't know what's going on mom." I said nervously. "I'm standing at your door, but no one's inside." "H-honey, you're br-br-breaking up. I-" I looked at my phone. "No cell services." I groaned in frustration.

Fear struck me when I heard the door, slowly creak open. "Hi honey." It sounded like my mom, but deeper and slower. I looked up from my phone to see my mom. "Hi?" I replied. She didn't say anything. She grabbed my waist and rushed me into the empty house. My mom's furniture was there, but no people. That's strange. My mind said.

My mom is a chatty, and kind person. We would joke that she could make friends anywhere. So having no one at her house, especially on Thanksgiving, was not like her. "Where is everybody?" I asked this imposter. "They're not here yet." She said sharply. She didn't look at me as she talked.

She leaded me to an empty room, with no windows, and filled with red writings that covered walls. She handed me a red marker as she placed me in the room. "I'll be out there cooking." She said to me, emotionless. "I could help if you want." I offered. She didn't reply. She closed the door behind her. Leaving me in a room with a closet. Hours passed and she didn't come back for me. I decided to look around the room where I'll be staying for some time. The red markings didn't say anything but were slashes. I wonder what they meant. I looked into the closet but found no clothes. I tried to open the door multiply times, but it was locked.

It has now been 3 weeks, and this is not my mother. She gives me food and water every day, but she slowly morphs into a sludgy creature. I don't know what to do. I've tried calling my mom, but it instantly goes to voicemail. I don't know what that thing wants. I've tried to escape but it always catches me. The slashes increase by one, every day. I think I know what it means. The room is getting darker every day. And one day, I won't be able to see anything, and the thing will get me. I think I'm ready.

THIS IS FICTION!
