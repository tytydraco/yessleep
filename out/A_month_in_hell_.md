"Tessie, this is how people end up killed. This is the shit, it  isn't a joking matter. I can't believe you did this, how are you going to get out of this?  
I can't help you, I want to and if it wasnt for my sons I would. I can't protect you from this , I can't get you out of this." Guy paces the floor throwing axes in hand, turns abruptly and throws the axe, sticking it the target.

Sobbing, already realizing, without Guy's  lecture, how fucked up my situation is. "I know, I know I fucked up. I'll fix it, I'll fix, I promise I'll fix it."

"Why? Why did you marry him? You had to know he  was like this.", not quite a yell but voice louder than his normal level tone, he questions. In 4 years I've never heard him yell, only heard his voice raised a handful of times and this, this is the first time his voice is raised to me. "I didn't even know you were seeing someone."

Guy is my best friend and father of my youngest son. Us not working out is a sad misfortune, him remaining my friend and amazing co- parent is a massive blessing. 

"I didn't know he was like this he seemed so good.  He was a Christian man, our beliefs aligned, he was my friend and I trusted him.  We take about not getting married until we dated for a year but then he made all these promises. He knew I needed money and to move closer and over night child care and 'if we are married I can help you with all that' he said. It was all a fucking lie though,  the money he said he had he didn't,  the ability to help with the kids also false,  I could move in with him still but he does shit like this. I should have waited for the 1 year mark, I should have seen the manipulation." 

"My son cannot live in his home.  He cannot be around a man who treats women like that,  treats his mom like that. He talked to you like he owned you,  like you were less than a dog. "

I had come to Guy's to pick our son up from his weekly visit. I arrived at 4:51, texted Nate that I had made it safe and River and Guy were playing in the kiddie pool.

Guy got River out of the pool and we  went into the house to change River's clothes and talk about our schedules for the next couple of weeks so we could plan who would have River what days.

My dumbass left my phone in the van. 

Nate arrived at Guy's house at 5:49. While Guy and I are sitting inside talking through our schedule Guy spots someone walking up his drive way,  rounding the corner to enter his back yard.  

Opening the door Guy ask, in a gruff voice, "Can I help you?"

"Where's my wife?", Nate's word are dripping with venom.

"Who's your wife?"

"Tess!"

"Don't know her."

Red with rage Nate growls ,"She's right behind you."

"What the hell are you doing here?" I try to ask but I am cut off by Nate.

Nate points at me and then does tha "come here" motion with his index finger and points to the spot next to himself. "You are coming home now you are my wife and you will come home with me."

"I'll come when I'm finished here."

"You will come now!"

Guy turns to the house, "Fuck this." 

I step further into the house as Guy shuts the door and heads for his garage, where his guns are kept. Nate turns and jogs to his truck. The truck he had parked in the road behind a line of bushes so that it wouldn't be seen as he snuck up the drive way.

Guy sat in his garage cleaning his gun. 

Once I was sure Nate had left and wasn't coming back, I went to the van for my phone. I opened my phone, 30 missed text messages, 25 from before Nate showed up, 47 missed calls, only 5 of those are from before Nate arrived.

1st text : 4:55 " Are you on your way yet?"
Missed call 4:57
2nd txt:   5:00 " you better respond to me"
Missed call 5:04
3rd txt:    5:05 " what are you doing, why aren't you responding to me"
Missed call 5:05
4th - 22nd txt:    5:06 - 5:30 "Babe?"
23rd txt:  5:30 "If you don't respond in 5 minutes I'm coming over there"
Missed call 5:31
24th txt:  5:34 "I'm on my way"
25th txt:  5:44 " I'm here"
Missed call 5:44

Nate's house is 20 minutes away, at the minimum, without traffic. There is no way he wasn't on his way before he sent the "Respond  or else text."

12 missed calls 6:01-6:05
26th txt:  6:05 "You better come home"
27th txt:  6:06 "You are MY WIFE you listen to ME"
20 missed calls 6:07-6:18
28th txt:  6:19  "why are you wearing different clothes"
29th txt:  6:19 "I checked the camera you were in a black shirt now you have on a grey tank top"
10 missed calls 6:20- 6:32
30th txt:  6:33 " I was just worried about you I'm sorry if I seem angry. Please come home."

We've only been married for TWO DAYS!

My phone rings again, and I answer it. "What the FUCK were you thinking?" 

"I was thinking my wife shouldn't be alone with another man and not talking to me"

"Well your wife is going to have to be around other men and just because  I'm your wife doesn't mean I have to text you 24/7 , you showed up in under an hr from my last text. That is fuxking crazy " 

Nate begins to try to justify himself and I inform him I will not be coming home tonight. I do not feel safe going to his house and that I will leave for work from Guy's house.

I ignore Nate's calls and text until I get to work at midnight. I know it was bitch of me but I couldn't stomach being talked to that way any more. It was to much for me. This is my 2nd marriage,  the first marriage was 13 years of physical and mental abuse and I refuse to subject myself to that again.

I arrive to work and Nate calls 15 minutes later as is our custom. The thing about night shift at a small dispatch center is it's mostly dead and it allows for some freedom. 

Nate tells me he's called my dad and told him of our fight. He tells me how my dad says he's the only guy I've ever dated that he liked, how my dad has sided eith him and thinks I should have listened to my husband and how my dad thinks we need marriage counseling. I hang up irrate at both Nate and my Dad. 

The next day is better. You can't give up on a marriage after 2 days....  Granted literally as soon as the papers were signed Nate started demanding to check my phone when I left the bathroom, or to check my phone when he came back from being out of the room. I let him though, shouldn't that be enough to trust me? He'd never found anything, I had nothing to hide. Why did he change so extremely as soon as we were married?

Granted I should have seen the signs, I can see them clear as day now. While dating he would occasionally go through my phone. He insisted I give  up all my guy friends except 1 ( well and Guy because Guy is River's dad he COULDN'T make me give him up)  Nate insisted on having my location,  then would randomly text me asking why I was driving though town xyz .... he especially did this if I drove through my friend's town. Even though I was allowed to keep one male friend I certainly was NOT allowed to see said friend if Nate wasn't there.

But I was raised to be a wife, a good wife, a " make your  husband look good, don't talk about your  problems, cook and clean and take care if the house and work a full time job wife"... I'm good at being a wife, but damn this month has been hard. 

I'll share more later. I have to get  my story out, I just need someone to know what all has happened. It keeps escalating, I carry constantly now. I am scared of him. There are so few people around me I can talk to about this. Guy gets angry when I try to talk to him about it. He feels helpless and I don't want to worry anyone else.
