I’m writing this in a moment of desperation.
Something bad is happening in this city and I’m not really sure if I’m going to make it out alive, so these are probably going to be my final words, the last testimony of a dying city.

It’s ironic really, you would expect a congressman or a police captain to give this final report, but no, it’s just me, a janitor of one of many stores of Downtown Toronto.

I was working the night shift, cleaning the place, like every other night, until out of nowhere a massive burst of light filled the store, almost making me go blind.

As it grew stronger the earth shook beneath my feet.
It wasn’t an earthquake though, it felt like a music track at high volume, it was almost rhythmic and I felt it vibrating throughout my whole body

Then, just as it started the shaking stopped and the light shined bright, illuminating the dark sky

I’m not sure what pushed me outside, maybe it was my curiosity, my need for understanding, or maybe it was something far more malicious that compelled me to come to them.

As I walked outside I tried to turn off the lights, saving on those electric bills, but I couldn’t, the switch did nothing.

Maybe whatever has created the light has messed up the city’s electric system, or maybe the switch was just busted, it happened a few times before.

I didn’t feel safe in the store anymore, I don’t know why, but the place felt different, uncanny even.

I speed walked away from there at a fast paste
but everywhere I looked felt the same, it felt like I got stuck on an alien world where everything is just similar to ours with some uncomfortable minute details

The silhouette of the buildings partially blocked the source of that blinding brightness that covered the whole city.

It seems like it was coming from Old Toronto.

As I walked throughout the streets I looked around to look at the windows, the shops, the alleyways.

Every light in the city was turned on, but there wasn’t a soul in sight, not even a timid peek from one of the windows.

I called out for someone, anyone to show up, but I was only greeted by the buzzing of the streetlights.

I couldn’t have been the last person left, and even if I was, where did everybody went?

I continued my lonesome march towards the city center, talking to myself to make me feel less lonely.

Then I heard a loud burst and the sound of glass shattering on the ground.

I looked behind me and saw that one of the street lamps have exploded.
Then I heard another, and another, then a loud explosion accompanied by a scream, coming from one of the apartments.

An old lady exited the building in a hurry with a small black poodle in her arms

She was stunned to see me outside and so was I to see her, but it was a relief none the less.

It was more than an hour since I saw a living person or heard one.

But our moment of comfort didn’t last long, the explosions continued around us accompanied by a cacophony of terrified screams.

I grabbed the old lady and her dog and rushed ourselves inside a dark alleyway.

The dog was shivering, didn’t even barked or cried, it just kept looking towards the light

I peeked from behind the corner to see the people that were hiding in their apartments sprinting out of there as fast as possible.

They were running away in a panic, dazed and confused, yet somehow, every single one of them instinctively ran towards the light.

I grabbed the first person I could find, a man wounded on the arm by a shard of glass.
It didn’t look bad, but I’m no doctor.

He seemingly snapped out of a trance, as if I burst a bubble that surrounded his whole body.

I guided him to our little dark alleyway as the unruly crowd was wildly running towards the same direction without even realizing it.

Some people even got trampled, as they regained lucidity they screamed for help for people to stop, but as soon as they caught the attention of someone else, that person would also be brought down by that wild, relentless flow of people.

I desperately held out a hand in the vain hope to snatch someone else from the crowd, but I almost got sucked in myself.

I could only take out two people:
A small kid and a fella on the larger size that almost got squashed by that horde of countless feet.

Then it stopped, there was nobody else that got out of those apartments.

The streets were littered with bodies, their broken figures illuminated only by the ominous light that stood above us.

God, there were so many corpses, so many people trampled over, littering the streets like they were garbage.

I looked back at the small group I managed to gather.

The old lady tended the wounded man’s gash, he was a large fellow, the type of guy you wouldn’t want to mess around with but he had lost a lot of blood, if he kept on running he wouldn’t have made it far.

The kid was still in her pajamas, holding back tears.

The chubby guy wasn’t in great shape either, he could walk but he was in a state of shock, trembling like a leaf

The Dog might have been the one in the best shape, but he wouldn’t leave its owner’s side, shivering by her legs, always looking towards the light.

none of them could go on any further through the city, but I wasn’t sure the apartments were safe either.

So I told them that I’ll go get help, the wounded man offered to come but the old lady promptly stopped him in his tracks, he was in no condition to go out.

So I left them behind, maybe it was for the best, maybe they’re the only one who’ll through this.

As I walked through the streets I saw even more bodies piling up, it felt like a movie you know, those big blockbuster zombie films were the dead were so many that they piled up over each other? Yeah, the spectacle isn’t as fun to watch when you’re in the midst of it, learned it the hard way I guess

The weak and the wounded were the ones to fell behind for the most part, their bodies squashed by the mass.

Elderly, wounded, disabled, pets, kids….

The sounds of the screams and the explosion are still replaying in my head as I write, and the worse was yet to come.

I wasn’t going to get help, it was pointless, the police and the firefighters probably took part in that reckless march as well

And the telephone lines, well they were probably in shambles at that point

The smell of burnt circuits filled the street, smoke still coming from the street lamps.

There was no fire surprisingly, as if it’s red color would interfere too much with the light’s brightness

I walked for like an hour after leaving those people alone in the alleyway, an hour of deafening silence, even the buzzing of the lights was gone, only my footsteps now echoed throughout the city.

Then I heard someone else walking right towards me

I stopped in my tracks

A road to the left was a couple of meters away from me, there was someone behind that corner.

I started walking backwards from where I came from while the person behind the corner drew closer.

I tried to move as far as way from them as possible, but I was scared that they would start to run after me.

As I moved backwards I tripped on one of the corpses on the ground, as I looked back up, I saw whoever was behind the corner finally showing themselves

It was a man, dressed in a dirty and torn suit, his shoes still covered in blood from the trampling.

A terrified expression was painted on his face, his mouth wide open in what looked like a scream.

As I looked closer I realized, he was blind, his eyes glossy and drained of colored, wide open and unblinking.

He stumbled forward in a trembling motion, breathing heavily and rapidly seemingly in a panic

His skin was pale, as if he just walked out of a freezer after being trapped in there for weeks, 

His hands were moved in front of him grasping the air in the hopes of finding something to hold onto.

It was a pathetic spectacle, a man reduced to a mere husk of his former self desperately trying to get a grip on a world that was now unknowable to him, or at least that’s what I thought…..

I tried getting closer to him, to see if I could do something to help

But the moment I walked forward a couple of steps, his neck quickly snapped towards my direction, his face still stuck in that terrified expression.

His body started to shake violently as he changed just in front of my eyes.

His breathing getting progressively faster and faster

The palms of his hands grew wider as a multitude of fingers started sprouting from them like parasites, his arms grew past his height, as his legs literally crumbled to dust.

Then his shoulders fused to his head which started swelling like a balloon.

And as this macabre spectacle of warping flesh happened before me, his skin started to crack as white bright light started pouring out, as if he had a literal sun burning inside of him.

This is the best I’ll be able to describe the creature that towered over me, it’s panicked breathing now lower and even faster almost sounding like a growl

I held my breath as I froze in fear over the carpet of bodies that covered the street.

The thing stood like a monolith above me, it’s bloated head suspended on it’s huge arms with beams of light shooting out from his frightened face

It looked around for a while, looking through the apartments windows and onto the streets.

I think he was still blind even in that mutated state.

Then, after the longest five minutes of my life, it turned back, walking further into the city center.

Even after the crowd, even after watching that man transforming in front of me, I still wanted to see what created the light.

A burning curiosity ate away at me, still does, I can’t really explain why, it’s just an instinctive need to know that I can’t shake off.

I know of the danger, I saw what I could become, then why do I want to know so bad?

Why can’t I stop?

Sorry for my ramblings, it’s been hard not talking to anyone for the past hours, I just really needed to vent for a moment

Anyway, after my encounter with the blind man
I decided to follow a different road towards the center.

Market street was my best call, it wasn’t as direct as the Main Street, but it was probably less crowded.

Turns out I was wrong

The crowd must’ve split apparently, but the number of bodies was significantly reduced compared to what I saw before.

Some of them weren’t trampled though, I think they died from exhaustion, yet even in their last moments their eyes looked towards the light, even their hands, stretched out desperately trying to reach it.

The shops were all dark, not even the great light could brighten the interior.

I’ve walked this road a thousand times and yet I could barely recognize it, a stranger in my own city.

That feeling of uncanny valley I felt before was even stronger in Market street, to the point of being nauseating.

I had to sit down even, my head was spinning and my stomach felt upside down.

I managed to push through though, but that feeling did not stop, even now, as I’m writing this, I feel like I’m inside a washing machine

The light of the screen feels comfortable though, warm even, it helps me keep my mind of the creeping uneasiness of the world around me.

Sorry, I started rambling again

Why am I even apologizing for, nobody is going to read this anyway, this might be the only piece of technology left in the whole city.

Never mind, writing makes me feel better, could be a copying mechanism, or just a desperate man’s delusions

The skyscrapers stood as ancient pillars as I made my way towards the center, the historical buildings and shops slowly turning into more modern office buildings.

I’ve never been in the central area, but I could recognize that it looked like a shade of what it once was.

The huge glass windows allowed the light to brighten up the office spaces inside.

It looks like a fight has took place in those rooms, window shattered, tables broken, chairs thrown, computers and printers that had burst into pieces.

And yet not a single body in sight.
 
I looked up towards the CN tower, the light was coming from there

It was taller than any of the building around it, towering over the city like a ancient sacred monument.

Then a low guttural cry echoed through the streets.

Another one of those things was coming towards me, making the ground shake with each step.

Assuming that one was blind too, I hid in one of the office buildings, the fact the walls were made of glass, didn’t matter if the thing couldn’t see.

My God, if whatever person it once was was still conscious…..

That’s a fate I don’t want to share

A pair of huge lardous, wobbly legs supported a female torso, missing it’s head and arms.
The upper body was normal in size if not slightly bigger than average, but her belly was bloated and engorged like a huge sack, proportionately as big as its monstrous legs.

Inside of a huge screaming baby ‘s face was pushing against the skin, begging to be let out, emitting a roaring cry that shook the very building I was in.

Much like the other one, light poured out of its cracking skin, making it impossible to see when it got too close.

It flailed wildly as if in a frenzy, smashing into buildings, destroying the smaller ones and making the skyscrapers shake.

When it was finally gone, my head kept ringing for a while, the howling screams of the beast still echoing through my head.

I don’t have the guts to get out of there anymore, as of now I’m still in that same building I hid in an hour ago from now.

Yet something is telling me that I need to reach the light, a gut feelings that tells me something worse is going to happen if I don’t.

But what could be worse than this?

People are mutating and dying in the streets the only survivors that I know of are far away tucked in a dark alleyway, while I’m hiding in a dark room with this weird computer thing

Yeah, right, I forgot to talk about it, the thing I’m using to write this down.

I found it in the basement, the least illuminated place in the whole building.

Somehow it was still intact and fully functioning

It looks like a computer, but it doesn’t need to be plugged into anything, it folds in on itself like a piece of paper, very light too

There’s a symbol on the back of the monitor, though I can’t recognize it, never see this brand before

It was already open on this page when I found it, looks like a social media of some kind, I remember hearing on the news that the kids
use this to talk to each others from far away, maybe one of them is still alive or human enough to read this.

If this is the case, don’t go to the light, don’t stare at it for too long and if you are alone, reach this address

14 Bathurst Street.

This is where I left the others, it should still be safe, you’ll find it easily if you get your hands on one of the city’s maps.

This is something I must finish on my own, I’ll bring this computer thing with me, it makes me feel safe somehow.

It sounds quiet outside, I think I’ll hop from one office building to another, just in case there are other computers like this one in there.

If anyone’s still out there, don’t come looking for me, I’ll write here if I make it out alive, besides, nobody else should be as stupid as me.

I’ve gone further than anyone else ever did without losing their mind and transform into those being.

I better hurry now, good luck out there
