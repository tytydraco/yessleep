Look, I'm not a writer, I'm just someone involved in the cleanup duty of a plane crash that happened like a decade ago or something. Everything I found here was typed into some document app that I can't remember right now. I'm not technically supposed to have this, considering it “interferes with an ongoing investigation” or whatever, but after having opened this laptop, going through it and realizing what's exactly on here, I figured the contents of this device are much better suited on here, where I believe the author originally meant to upload them. I'm only sending the first document through at the moment as I have yet to properly screen the rest of this computer's contents. I think y'all will see why I'm posting this.(Also, the only reason I found these writings is because this was the only tab open on the computer; incredibly, it still had a charge.)



Hello! To the people I hope have found this document, my name is Mariya Wallens, and I, along with 12 other individuals, have been involved in a plane crash. I'm not sure what details to give. We were departing from Orlando and on our way to Uruguay on March 26, 2016, when there was a shake, the flight attendants started yelling, and the plane went down. I must've been knocked unconscious by the force of the crash. When I came to, I was sitting, still fastened to my chair, looking at what looked like complete darkness, but slowly faded into the shape of other rows of seats in front of me as my eyes adjusted to what seemed to be moonlight. It took me a second to realize, but after looking around for a couple of seconds, still dazed and confused, I saw that the entire front section of the plane, starting from what looked like the wings, had been torn completely off, and what usually would lead to the cockpit of an aircraft now led to what looked to be sand. 

I stared, dumbfounded for a few more minutes, going over every single possibility that my brain could muster at that moment. At first, I thought I was dreaming, or maybe someone spiked my Minute Maid pink lemonade with acid while I was walking through TSA, but after every minute that passed, those humble, realistic then, reassurances seemed less and less grounded in reality, and eventually the truth wiggled its way into the forefront of my mind. My plane had crashed, and as far as I knew, I was the only person who survived.

Upon realizing this, I began to hyperventilate before quickly realizing that I shouldn't make too much noise. This plane crashed into what I presumed was the South American coast. Loud noises could very well attract predators. The air smelled foul and seemed to have an unpleasant taste, which also helped to ease my frantic respiration. I sat back and began to think of what I should do. I went over a few options, none of which sounded particularly nice, but the one where I unbuckled my seatbelt and walked out of here sounded the best, so I settled on that. That option, however, of course came with the caveat that because of the noise reason stated earlier, I would need to be extremely quiet. I began attempting to unbuckle my seatbelt when I noticed something that made my stomach turn. It was stuck, and at some point throughout the crash, it had become so tightly wrapped around me that wriggling my way out of it was pushed out of the equation before it was even conceived. I muttered a profanity to myself and then sat back again, thinking to myself about what I should do now that plan A failed me, and eventually settled on simply waiting for daylight. I couldn't make noise in the dark due to the possibility of there being unforeseen predators lurking about, so waiting until I could seemed like the most logical option. 

After maybe an hour of hearing branches crack in a presumed forest to the left of me and the bending of aluminum that made up the plane's shell, I put my head down, and with the addition of the waves from the beach, I was pretty sure the plane crashed next to me, fell asleep. When I awoke, I was in the same place and position I was in relative to when I fell asleep, and the sunlight, which now poured through the front of the cabin and out of every open window, illuminated everything around me. The view was horrific. In the row ahead of me, an old woman lay strung across the middle seat, the mid-section of her abdomen pushed impossibly deep by its leathery, hard surface. Her spine seemed to be broken, and her intestines were most definitely crushed. I didn't dare look at her face.

I was panicking again, and so I attempted to focus on my breathing, but it didn't work. The look of that woman was worse than anything I had ever seen in any textbook; it was appalling and lingered in my mind for at least 30 minutes until my brain thoroughly processed what I had just laid witness to. I looked down at my restraints; the buckle looked like it had been busted somehow, which explained why I couldn't seem to get it undone the night before. I looked around for something sharp I could use to cut the strap, but of course, there was nothing around me, within reaching distance that was, that could assist me in freeing myself.

After another 30 minutes of trying a various array of different, very dull, and somewhat dull objects, I began to hear something that wasn't waves, branches, or the sound of myself yelling at the inanimate objects. It was the sound of someone else, not yelling at inanimate objects, of course, but communicating with someone else, who seemed to be communicating back. I stayed deathly still and listened further as the voices continued closer and closer towards the part of the aircraft I was in. They were both men and seemed to be speaking English, which was good because I was and am still not bilingual. One of their voices seemed to be deeper than the others, which is how I was able to differentiate between the two.

 “I hate coming back here, it's so eerie, and always feels so wrong.” The less deep voice said in a shaky tone. “Dude, you have to learn to relax, ok? We need all we can get, clothes, electronics, food, etcetera.” They seemed to walk in silence until they reached what seemed to be the back end of the plane, which brought to my attention that I had never checked behind me when I was looking around earlier. I closed my eyes and went completely still. I was going to listen for the time being. I heard scuffling when the footsteps seemed to reach the plane's access point, before the deeper voice blurted out with what sounded like annoyance, “I'll go first then.” and the sound of feet being planted on the plane's body filled the tunnel.
