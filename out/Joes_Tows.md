The call came in at 1:34 a.m. I groaned as I rolled over, cursing myself for not putting it on Do Not Disturb before laying my head down. I squinted against the glaring light of my screen at the call window. Mark, my 23-year-old son, was calling. I swiped to answer and grunted out a,

“Hello?”

“Hey Dad, it’s me. Sorry to call so late. Engine died on me on the highway out past Mill’s Road. Could you give me a lift home?”

I paused, still trying to orient myself with reality so soon after being woken.

“Uh… sure Mark, I’ll be right there.”

“Thanks, Dad. Sorry again. Love you.”

Now, before I go do what I’m about to do, I want to share my story one last time. Think of it as a way to have all the facts down in writing in case I don’t make it back.

Seven years ago, I got a call at 2:30 in the morning. I was asleep in my bed at the time. I worked at the family business run by my father.

“JOE’S TOWS,” he called it. Joe was his name, and towing was his game. He owned a franchise with fleets of tow trucks for everything from dragging a car out of the ditch to righting a toppled big rig. I’d been towing for him since I got my license. Even did my driving test in one of the smaller trucks with a winch mounted in the front. It was a decent job, and in between helping a bunch of embarrassed but grateful folk, I got to kick back and relax.

I’d been at the job 24 years, and the quiet night shifts were a nice reprieve from the nagging missus and our moody teenage son, Mark. That particular night, I wasn’t working the night shift. Normally, the call would have been taken by whoever was, but the new kid was a lazy ass and notorious for shutting off his phone, so it rerouted to mine, which was almost always on. The kid was gonna get a harsh talk the next day, I’d vowed to nobody in particular.

I picked up with the usual, “Joe’s Tows, need a tow?”

There was a sound on the other line, like someone trying to discreetly clear their throat before they replied.

“Yeah, hey, so I blew a tire and have no jack to change it. Haven’t seen anyone to flag down, so I figured I’d have to suck it up and call.”

“Sure thing, happens all the time,” I responded, trying to sound like I hadn’t been catching a few winks.

“Whereabouts are you stuck?”

“About 10 miles west past Love’s Travel Stop. You know the one?”

“Yeah, that’s a bit far out. Just sit tight. It shouldn’t take more than an hour to get to you. Do you have a spare?”

“Yep, no problem,” he said cheerily.

“I’m not going anywhere.”

The guy sounded like he was chowing down on something. At least he wasn’t going to go hungry while he waited, I’d thought.

I hung up the phone and rolled over with a grunt. I’d only been asleep for a few hours, and no rest had yet been had. I looked at my wife, Maddie, lying next to me, rubbing sleep out of her eyes. I felt a bit guilty for waking her.

We’d hit a rough patch lately, and a lot of nights had been spent airing out our grievances to find a compromise so we weren’t going to bed angry. Probably another reason for the lack of rest. Lack of sleep never helps keep tempers cool.

I swung my legs out of bed and stumbled over to the bathroom door to get ready for a long night. I splashed some water into my eyes to get rid of the sleep crud and caught the reflection of my wife standing in the doorway, shielding her eyes.

“Go back to sleep, honey. Looks like I gotta go above and beyond tonight,” I grumbled.

“I’m awake now. Would… you like some company for the drive?” she asked, using the voice I’d come to recognize as the please don’t let this become an argument tone. “Maybe the drive would be good for us.”

I wanted to refuse and send her back to sleep. No sense in both of us being bone-tired tomorrow. But I could tell she really wanted this, and, not going to lie, I wasn’t looking forward to an hour or so alone on a stretch of dark road. One of her grievances was about how much time I spent away from home. Maybe seeing what I did all night could have been a turning point.

“Yeah, sure,” I finally responded after weighing my options.

“I’m out the door in 10 minutes. Hopefully, this is going to just be a quick change and not a tow, ’cause you’ll be stuck out there for however long this takes. If we gotta get this guy back into town, you’ll be stuck in the middle seat.”

“I’m okay with that.” She sounded uncertain but started getting dressed anyway.

She really meant to come along. I sighed and got dressed, put on my heavy coat with the reflective stripes. I moved quietly through the small house, hoping to at least not disturb Mark. He was almost finished with high school and could look after himself, but I still didn’t want him worrying about both his parents being suddenly gone. I scrawled out a note and set it on the table.

“Mark, Took Mom To Work, Call If We’re Not Home By 8.”

I pulled on my boots and stepped out into the fall’s night air. Despite how tired I was, I felt an invigorating breeze blow against my face and heard the rustle of dead leaves blowing down the street. It was the perfect night, in my opinion.

I got in the company’s big Ford with the tow kit and was about to pull out on my own when the passenger door swung open and Maddie climbed in. I don’t remember if I was tired and had forgotten or if I’d expected her to change her mind, but I was surprised to see her. She buckled in and settled in for the drive, giving me a tired smile. I probably returned one very similar.

Now, I won’t bore you all with the details of the talk, but suffice to say, it was good. We grabbed some Waffle House coffee, talked about life, and it was a refreshing change of pace from the tension we’d felt around the house.

We passed by Love’s, which got us talking about how we’d met there 19 years ago. By the time the headlights caught a little Buick parked along the dirt shoulder of the road, we were talking about a second honeymoon together after Mark left for college.

The first thing I noticed was that the car was dark. I wondered if maybe the guy had decided to get some sleep while he waited. Giving the horn a quick honk as we approached, we waited for any signs from the driver that he was in there.

Sometimes people got impatient and tried to walk, but Love’s would have been the closest, and we’d seen no other people on the drive. I switched on the work lights to brighten up the road and turned on the flashers so anyone coming from either direction would know to slow down. The last thing I needed was to get swiped by a clueless driver.

I gave Maddie’s hand a squeeze and assured her this wouldn’t take too long, that I’d leave my door open so she could still holler if she needed anything. I hopped out and heard the click of Maddie’s door lock. I was about to make a comment about animals not being able to open doors but figured it best to keep my mouth shut with us on better terms.

If she felt safer with the forest-side door locked, so be it.

From the tilt of the car, it looked like the rear passenger tire was the culprit. I called out for the driver, who still hadn’t so much as turned a light on in the car to indicate he’d heard me arrive. There was no spare tire leaning against the bumper, so I needed him to open the trunk for me to get it myself. Inspecting the flat tire, it looked like he’d run it against something jagged. The tear was obvious, a chunk of rubber had been torn from the side, and it was pure luck that he hadn’t fishtailed into the ditch. I walked around to the driver’s side door to see if the driver was even there and peered in.

What was in there nearly had me falling over backward to get away. Across the car, I saw that the passenger window was smashed inward, glass covered the inside of the car, but what was worse was the grinning red face staring out from the driver’s seat. As I regained my footing and took a closer look, I saw that what I was looking at was muscle. Two whole round eyeballs with no eyelids to cover them stared off into the distance. He was completely naked, but somehow he was still belted into the seat. I turned to run back to the truck, collapsing to my knees to vomit on the road.

Never had I seen such a messed-up thing outside a horror movie, and I knew I needed to get to safety fast. I blinked the tears out of my eyes as my dry heaving started to subside, and the ringing in my ears let up. It was replaced by the ear-splitting screams of my wife coming from the truck not 15 feet away. I could make out the silhouette of something in the cab, its back end sticking out the open driver’s side door. I thought Bear at first, but the head inside the cab had antlers scraping the headliner and a face like a deer skull. Maddie was kicking at it and screaming while the beast raked at her. Blood started spraying the interior of the cab, and her cries grew more shrill in the night.

Now, I’m not proud of what I did next. It’s a shame that I will never be able to live down, and I accept that, but nobody sees that amount of blood and thinks they have a chance of saving that person. I loved my wife, still do through thick and thin, but at that moment, I needed to live. Getting myself killed trying to rescue her from whatever the hell that was wouldn’t do Mark any good. The idea of him waking up to an empty house, heading off to school just to be pulled out of class to hear the news that his parents were mauled by some monster… I couldn’t do that to him. So I ran. I had the wherewithal to keep hold of the long handle used to pump the jack, for all the good it would do me against that thing.

Into the dark woods I went. The contrast from the brightness of the floodlights on the road to the absolute blackness of the forest canopy left me disoriented. I knew there were plenty of fir trees with their sharp broken branches jutting out, just waiting to impale me. Running fast and my eyes were so filled with tears, I couldn’t adjust to the lack of light. The moon was half into its cycle, and the stars were mercifully bright that night, but none of that did me any favors with the thick foliage overhead. I was clotheslined by some low-hanging branch and nearly screamed, thinking the monster had caught up to me. I rolled onto my hands and knees in the underbrush, listening for any signs of pursuit.

All was quiet. Not just from any pursuers, but there wasn’t so much as a chirp from a bird or the buzz of a mosquito in the woods that night. It was like everything knew to shut the hell up. I had no idea what that thing was, how it hunted, if it could smell me, for how long… it would take… to finish with poor Maddie. I was in pure flight mode right then. Maybe it couldn’t climb! I felt around the tree that had hit me, keeping my ears on alert for any nearby rustling. I’d lost my only weapon before even getting a chance to swing it. My only option now was to find a place to hide. The tree that had hit me wouldn’t do. Probably a birch, not high enough to get me to a safe elevation.

I felt around some more, very conscious of how much noise I was making in my search. Reaching out frantically, I felt hot pain shoot up my arm. My palm erupted in agony as it was impaled on the very sharp broken branch of a fir tree. Thing about fir trees is when they don’t get enough sunlight to their lower branches due to the canopy, the branch dies. In a thick forest, only the topmost branches have any needles, which leaves a dangerous array of sharp spears sticking around at eye level and up. I slapped my bloody hand over my mouth to stifle another scream. The first one had been unavoidable. I listened.

I heard nothing. I listened a moment longer….

Snap.

The sound had come from the direction of the road. I could still vaguely hear the engine idling in the distance. I swore at how little distance I had managed to get. Any thoughts about circling back around were also out of the question. The thing was coming, and for all I knew, I was in its territory.

“Dammit.”

Then I realized maybe this fir tree could be exactly what I needed. As a kid, back when kids still ran feral through the woods unsupervised, my friends and I would climb them all the time. From what I’d seen of the creature, it looked pretty bulky. I knew bears could climb trees, but this fir was covered in wooden spears. I was no skinny kid anymore, but I wasn’t as big as that thing was. Maybe it would be too bulky to have its weight supported by the dead branches. Hopefully, I hadn’t packed on too much weight for them to support me, though. It was already looking like an impossible climb with my bloodied hand.

I started clambering up the tree, taking multiple cuts and scrapes to the face, forearms, knees, and one particularly nasty poke in the thigh. I could still hear whatever that was getting closer, so I resolved to worry about where I was bleeding from until after I’d survived the night. In the blackness, I reached, hand over my head, muscles and skin burning. Pitch was making bits of bark glue themselves to me, and needles fell as the narrow trunk swayed. I kept going, not stopping even to listen for the creature until I grasped a rough and very much still alive branch. I must have made it at least 30 feet off the ground by this point. My hands, now both slick with blood, screamed at me and threatened to slip off the jagged bark.

The slow, deliberate steps coming toward my tree gave me just enough motivation as I pulled myself up and over the branch. It creaked in protest, and I heard the faint crack in the wood. That branch was not for sitting comfortably, but it had to do. Wrapping my arms around the trunk, I managed to pull myself into a standing position, wedged between two more branches probably no thicker than three inches. I locked my fingers together and wedged my feet as close to the base of the branch as I could get it, hugging the tree that I hoped would save my life.

I waited. And waited some more.

Waited for the sound of clawed paws climbing up behind me or the snap of it not bothering to climb and just pushing the tree over. Lord knows I’d left a clear enough trail if it hunted by scent.

Waited for the wind to blow and bend the tree enough to break my perch, sending me plummeting to the ground and certain death.

Waited for the sun to rise so someone would notice the bloody scene on the side of the road and send help.

The first thing to end my wait was the sound of claws, but surprisingly not coming from beneath my tree.

The sound of breaking and creaking branches was coming some ways off. Close enough that I knew the direction but not exactly how close. Whatever was after me was making no attempt to be stealthy. Claws digging into wood, inhuman but also not quite animalistic grunts, and heavy panting were the only sounds beside the wind occasionally whistling through the treetops. The creature must have found a spot in its tree to stop because the forest once again grew quiet. I stared wide-eyed in what I assumed was its direction, hoping my eyes could adjust enough to this dim starlight to at least get a look at it.

I was high up enough in the canopy that, when the moon peeked out from behind the clouds that had been obscuring it, I caught a glint of eye shine. Two specks of light staring at me from another tree, eye level and only 20 feet away. Then the moon vanished again. Still, having acquired a frame of reference, I started being able to make out its general shape. I remember reading somewhere that humans do have some form of night vision. We can’t make out details, but our brains are hardwired to catch movement even if the shadows look completely black.

There it was, strange long arms dangling, pale skull rocking side to side in the swaying of the tree. The bulky body didn’t look like it could be supported by the branch it was perched on. Those dangling arms weren’t gripping a branch, but it didn’t seem to have any trouble maintaining balance. The head had antlers, big ones, probably a 14-pointer. Something seemed off about the eye shine, but that felt pretty minor in the moment.

We were locked in a staring contest. It didn’t move from its branch, and I didn’t dare to move at all for fear of it attempting a wild lunge for my small perch. I knew it was taunting me. If it wanted, it could have climbed my tree. The wind was blowing, causing the trees to sway, and all I could do was pray that it would swing me back upright but not so far forward that it brought me closer to that thing.

I felt the sickening vertigo as the tree angled backwards, giving the illusion of falling. The beast’s tree swayed in my direction just as the moon came out once more, and in the faint moonlight, I caught a glint of teeth from behind the deer skull. It was then I was able to put the creature’s features together. From the floppy, fur-covered arms to the hollow eye sockets of the skull, I knew it wasn’t some bear-deer monstrosity. It was wearing the skins and bones of past kills.

I remembered the flayed body in the front seat of the car. Had it got to him while the driver waited, busting in the passenger side window? My mind wandered back to Maddie and her screams. I tried to picture her as she had been. Sitting next to me in the truck, safe, anxious… not as she might look now after it was done with her.

As my adrenaline started to wane, the emotions I’d had to push aside started flooding in. She hadn’t deserved that. She should have stayed home. I should have risked the cold attitude later and just told her that she couldn’t join me. Now she was gone in the most horrible way imaginable, and we were never going to get to make it better. I realized I was sobbing rather noisily. Pitch- and blood-covered hands are horrible for rubbing the tears from your eyes.

There was a moment of panic when, in my grieving, I’d lost sight of the monster. It feels odd to say I was thankful it was still where I had last seen it, but at least it wasn’t closer or someplace new. It was still holding onto the tree, staring at me, bear arms swinging like shirt sleeves drying on the line.

More time passed. I was exhausted, both emotionally and physically. Still, that thing stared at me. I guessed sunrise couldn’t be too far off because the moon had made good progress towards the horizon. I slowly scooted my butt down to rest one cheek on separate branches. My legs wrapped around the other side, trying to distribute my weight safely. I needed the rest. It wouldn’t be long before the sun rose and someone on their way to work noticed the gruesome sight on the side of the road. I just needed to conserve my energy and make it to dawn.

The East was starting to turn that navy blue preceding the sunrise. I gave the creature another glance, making sure it hadn’t moved, then rested my chin on a branch and rested my eyes. I was startled back into consciousness by a buzzing from my pocket. My phone. I thought I’d left it in the truck! In my desperation to get away, I hadn’t even checked my pockets, but there it was, ringing with my potential savior. I pulled it out of my pocket with my less injured hand. The number was familiar but not one of my contacts.

Flicking the Answer button, I didn’t wait.

“Hello! Hello! Please help me. I’m stuck in a tree and there’s something trying to kill me.”

A familiar voice spoke out of the phone speaker.

“Yeah, hey, so I blew a tire and have no jack to change it. Haven’t seen anyone to flag down, so I figured I’d have to suck it up and call.”

I pulled the phone up to my face and looked at the number again. I recognized it now. The guy who had called to get me out here. The skinless man, still sitting dead in his driver’s seat. I looked up at where the creature was still perched and noticed a glow coming from near the deer skull. In the bluish light of predawn, I could see more of it under the stolen skins. It had the look of a gangly human with patchy skin ranging from black to brown to white, hollow cheekbones. From what I could see of the lower half of the face, below the deer skull, it looked like a man’s face, but the skin was sagging and the cheeks… The cheeks were slit to accommodate an inhumanly wide mouth. It didn’t seem to have any lips of its own to cover its red-stained teeth.

I watched as it held its mouth open wide, and a voice poured out as it talked into the phone again.

“I managed to grab a bite to eat, so the wait isn’t too bad. It was the boredom that was getting to me. I wanted to thank you for the entertainment tonight.”

It said in the casual voice of its victim. I saw the light of a phone screen turn to face me and a spindly thumb move across it. The call from the fake driver ended, and the phone disappeared underneath the bear skin covering. The shoulders of the creature moved awkwardly underneath its covering, and another light came on in the folds. My phone buzzed again, and I looked back to it in my hand.

“WIFE” was written in all caps above the smiling face of my Maddie.

Shaking so badly I nearly dropped it, I slowly swiped my thumb to accept the incoming call. The sound of a throat being cleared on the other end, just like the one I’d heard at the start of the first call. Then a voice that nearly made me lose my grip on the tree.

“Hey honey. It’s okay to come down now. I’m back in the truck waiting safely, and I’m getting kind of lonely.”

“Fuck you!” I screamed into the phone, then glared at the monster, hanging up on it. It closed its mouth, face still in that perpetual grin. Then it opened again, and from 20 feet away, I heard an exact replication of my wife’s screams joined by the pleading screams of the other voice. The longer it screamed at me, the more voices joined it until I risked letting go of the trunk to cover my ears. My phone plummeted to the ground, and I heard the dull thud of it landing on the bed of needles and branches below.

The creature abruptly stopped its screaming medley and resumed staring at me. I released my ears and once again gripped the tree, thinking that was it. That was going to be its time to strike. A gust of wind blew through the canopy from behind me and pushed my tree towards its waiting form. I closed my eyes, picturing Mark waking up to find our note. Pictured him just sitting there waiting for his parents who would never come home.

I knew they would eventually find Maddie, but would they find mine? Would I be stuck high in this tree as a skinned corpse that wouldn’t be found until I was just a skeleton? With the brightening world blurred by tears, I waited for the killing blow. Instead, it made a low guttural laugh. In what I assume was its own voice, it growled,

“Lucky for you, I don’t think I can handle a third meal in a single night.”

Then, with inhuman agility, it leaped. Not at me, though. It leaped for a tree deeper into the forest. I watched it spring further and deeper into the canopy until it must have dropped down out of sight. The bastard could have gotten to me any time it wanted. It had toyed with me the entire night, and now I was all alone.

The rumble of a noisy old truck caught my attention. The road was starting to get busy. I wondered how long before someone would come looking for me. For one chilling moment, I wondered if maybe the creature had circled back around and was making those car noises to lure me into a false sense of security. It could be waiting just at the treeline for me to come down looking for help and pull me back into the woods and skin me alive.

That image is what kept me sitting in that tree until the sun was fully visible over the hills. That was also about the time two highway patrol officers, guns drawn, came crashing through the brush. I started sobbing at the sight of them. They trained their guns on me, and only when they realized I wasn’t likely a threat did they bark at me to come down slowly.

I complied, peeling my bloodied and cramped hands from the bark of the tree. I took my time getting down, now able to see all the branches I’d broken on the way up. When I got to the bottom, I was in no condition to tell them my story, and they looked at each other with bewilderment. I later was told that I looked like a walking corpse with bags under my eyes and waxy pale skin.

I also later found out that some driver had stopped to inspect the abandoned truck and car. They had seen two skinless bodies and a mess of blood bathing the windshield of my truck. Six cop cars were lining the highway as well as two ambulances when we exited the forest. One of them was loading up a body bag. I lost all strength in my legs at the sight of them, and the officers helped me into the back of another ambulance. A blanket was put over my shoulders, and sympathetic pats on my back came from a paramedic who brought me water.

It was all a blur after that. Questioning at the hospital, then again at the station. There was plenty of skepticism from the officers interviewing me. They never found what happened to their skin, and they conceded that with the amount of blood in both vehicles, there would have had to have been some on me. All testing of my clothes and body showed only my own blood.

Oddly, the most tangible evidence they paid attention to was the receipts from our coffee, showing I hadn’t been present at the car owner’s time of death. A medical exam for both my body and mind told the story of a man who survived something traumatizing. In the end, the oversimplified conclusion was that a very unique bear had attacked during a routine towing.

It didn’t fit anything at the scene, but I suppose it doesn’t matter as long as it’s plausible on paper.

Mark didn’t handle it well. He barely talked to me in his grief, turning to drugs and booze as years passed until it got to the point where I had to ask him to leave. The accusations of it being my fault were too much for me to handle, and he was only making me feel more miserable. Not that he thought I murdered his mother. His accusations all came down to blaming me for not doing more to save her.

The last time I saw him was when he left the house with five boxes of his things and said he was moving in with his girlfriend. The only time he called me was to guilt me into giving him money for food and rent, which I did.

My dad set up a dispatch line for me so I could stay employed and off the road after my “ordeal,” as he called it. Everybody believed something happened, but nobody believed what I told them happened. Eventually, I sold the empty house and moved into a single-bedroom apartment, away from the memories.

That brings you all up to speed on where I’m at. So you’ll see why I’m going to do this tonight. I’m going to load up my shotgun and go to Mill’s Road. I’m going to put an end to the monster that killed my wife and now has probably killed my son too.

Tonight, it made the mistake of leaving me nothing to live for. If I make it back, I’ll let you know what it looks like without the stolen skins. I’ll drag it on live TV and show the world what’s lurking in the forest.
