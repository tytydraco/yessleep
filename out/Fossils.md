When I was seven years old I thought I was going to become an archeologist. The idea of digging up dinosaur bones was my number one priority. My family had just moved to a large plot of land that had once been a thriving dairy farm but had fallen into a state of disrepair. During the summer of 2010 my parents were preoccupied with renovating the farmhouse, demolishing and rebuilding old fences, and much more boring adult stuff, so most days to stay out of their hair and not have to listen to them argue, I would wander over the hill behind our house to a patch of rocks that lay at the base on its other side. I would dig around for hours believing that if I just turned over one or two more rocks I’d find a T-Rex skull. 


Most days I’d just dig around finding bugs and spiders, cataloguing them in my bright orange notebook. Sometimes there would be animal tracks on the patches of bare dirt, I’d try to make casts of them using cement mix I stole from my dads shed, though it was to little avail. I did make a pretty neat cast of a kangaroo's foot I still have to this day. Once there was a pair of boot prints too big to be mine and too small to be my dads that just kind of walked in a circle around my quarry, I figured maybe one of the neighbouring farmers or their kids were also looking for dinosaur bones, so I left a note on the pile of fence posts nearby letting them know this was my dig site but they were welcome to come and play nerf guns some time. 


On one occasion I stumbled upon what I now know was just a huge centipede but at the time was convinced it had to be some ancient species of insect that had been hiding under this rock for a millennia just waiting to be found.


As a child a moment like this can make you feel as though the universe has tailored an experience just for you, as if someone has read your mind and planted the thing you want to see right before your eyes, as you grow older and learn more about the world you realise that the universe doesn’t have some grand plan to help you rediscover an ancient species of invertebrate, every living thing is its own autonomous being, it can choose what rock it want to lay under, it can choose where to lay its eggs, and, if you are an obnoxious enough snot nose little kid who decides to poke it, it can choose to bite you. 


I still remember the sting, well, sting may not be the right word. The pain hits you like a lightning bolt, enough to send a grown man to the ground. My ankle was throbbing so bad I was genuinely convinced I was going to lose my foot. I was ass up in a patch of rocks with god knows how many more of those little bastards around me, what do I do? 


In Australia, at least regional areas, schools teach you how to react in cases of being bitten by snakes and spiders, how to identify what bit you, who to call, and when to worry. That monstrosity was in my eyes a hybrid, a snakes body with a spiders legs, therefore, in my little kid mind, it must be as venomous as both a snake AND a spider and would surely kill me, I just hoped I would be lucky enough to die before I felt my throbbing bright red foot fall off. 


After what felt like an eternity, but was probably more akin to about a minute or so, of making peace with the universe, the pain began to subside, though only slightly. This was enough of a motivator for me to hobble to my feet. Using my shovel as a crutch I left my notebook and bucket of “fossils” at the far edge of the rock patch as I painstakingly made my way up and over the hill crying for my mum the whole way. 


My parents rushed me into town to the hospital, I told the nurse I had been bitten by a dinosaur-insect-spider-thing, she looked confused yet calm, and started manhandling my foot, squeezing the wound which forced out a large mucous like stream of venom, puss and blood. I still remember the queasy look on my fathers face as he excused himself from the room. When the nurse calmly asked me to describe the dinosaur I didn’t know how to.


“It was this long brown and red snake thing. It had so many legs and it hurts so much I think my foot’s gonna fall off” I sobbed, the nurse smiled and thought for a moment, then suddenly lit up as the realisation of what I was describing hit her. She opened a tab on her computer and showed me a picture of a centipede.


“Was that what bit you, love?” 


I nodded excitedly, this woman had also seen the dinosaur? And then it dawned on me that I in fact had not uncovered an ancient genus of insect, and poking and subsequently being bitten by that gross little critter was for nothing.


After tending to my wound, and talking about insects and dinosaurs the nurse printed out a script for some antibiotics and also the wikipedia article on centipedes so I could learn more about them. 


It was over a week before I could muster the courage to walk over that hill again, but eventually I knew I had to, my notebook with all my “research” was over there and it was going to rain overnight. In my mind that notebook was just about the most important thing to me, it mapped out the whole rock patch, said where I found what, I needed to add the centipede lair and all the facts I’d learned about them to my manuscript. 


I approached cautiously, observing the crevice beneath every rock, weaving my way between them all, I was ready to stomp the living daylight out of the first creepy crawly I encountered. A small huntsman scurried between two rocks which caused me to lose patience and run for the notebook. Grasping it in my hands I shook the sandy looking dirt from its almost fluorescent orange cover, and climbed on top of the pile of fence posts where I had left my note for the other archeologist. The note was now gone but I paid little mind to that fact, as long as all the fossils in my bucket were accounted for there would be no hard feelings. 


Catching my breath, I flipped through my book, looking for the next blank page. When I found something peculiar, there were notes at the bottom of my last page, most of them scrawled in what I thought was cursive, in some cases looking more like symbols or pictures than words. But one stood out at the bottom, written in neat, but clearly hastily written words: 


“When will you come and play again? I hope we didn’t scare you”


It was in this instant I became convinced the insects were speaking to me. I had to run back to the house and lock the doors. I didn’t want to be an archeologist any more. It was time to hang up the whip and satchel. A bite is one thing but them writing to me? Not happening. 


I jumped off the pile of fence posts and went to grab my bucket, as I picked it up I realised it felt way to light, I peered down to see all my dead bugs, cow bones and funny shaped rocks were missing, replaced with nothing but a small bright white, fresh, bone, the first I had seen that definitely wasn’t that of a farm animal. I dropped the bucket and ran. 


I sprinted for the top of the hill, clutching my notebook, and took one last look at my life's work, all the rocks I had turned, holes I had dug, and that damn set of foot prints again, whoever was leaving them could take my fossils and keep those talking insects while he was at it. I was going to find a new calling, I was about to be eight years old for crying out loud, dinosaurs were for babies anyways. Maybe I’d try my hand at being an astronaut, after all there are no talking bugs in outer space.
