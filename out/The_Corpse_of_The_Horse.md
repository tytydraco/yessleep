The morning of March sixth was the moment my world got turned upside down. It was a Thursday morning, colder than usual, an inch or so of snow still avoiding its inevitable fate. I woke up groggy, with the only cure being a hot cup of coffee. As I walk into the kitchen, there it was. The rotting corpse of a horse. 

I was immediately shocked out of my daze. A horse? On my kitchen table? I circled the corpse. It was in a state of decay, its skin and flesh peeling off the bones. Its skull was fully exposed. Empty, dark circles that were once called eyes stared back at me, straight into my soul. 

I fumble around with the lock of my door as I rush out into the stairwell of my apartment, still in my pyjamas. I knocked on the door of my neighbour to no answer. Must've left for work already. As I reenter the room, the stench finally hits me. I gag as the warm scent of blood and rot make it to my nostrils. I made my way to every single one of the windows in my apartment and opened them. It is then that I finally decide to call the police.

I had some time to myself to think in the time the cops arrived. One awful thought kept creeping into my mind. All my doors and windows were locked. How did it get in?

The officers finally arrived while I was waiting in the stairwell. I couldn't bare the smell, the sight, or the implications of that... thing. I went through all the details with them, signed some paperwork, and they were off, having called in some biowaste cleaners. It was more than nothing, but since they didn't see any sign of forced entire there wasn't a lot they could do.

I was left with the horse again. I couldn't leave home since I had to wait for the biowaste team, and I couldn't really sit in the cold stairwell all day. So, with a clothes pin on my nose, I went about my day as normally as I could. 

I tried to keep my gaze away from the rotting pile of meat and bones on my dinner table, I really did, but everytime I passed by the horse to go to the bathroom or get some water, its lifeless stare would burn into the back of my skull.

An hour had passed with no sign of the biowaste team. Though it felt way longer. 

As I got up from my desk to take a leak, the absurdity of the situation finally set in. A fucking horse? And a dead one at that? Why? How? Why me?

I decided to do something. I couldn't just sit on my ass while the horse juices get absorbed by my imported walnut table. I was going to clean the horse up myself.

The soulless eyesockets of the horse stared at me relentlessly as I grabbed the serated knife from the kitchen counter. I was meaning to get a new one anyways. I started with the limbs. The knife when through the flesh and skin as if it was butter. The most disgusting butter known to man. The blade stopped up when I got to the bones, so I had to put some more elbow grease into it.

An hour or two had passed and there still was no sign of the clean up crew, but luckily I had done their job. I had put the body parts of the horse into garbage bags. I double layered them just to make sure. It took me another thirty minutes to carry all of them down to the garbage dunks. I took the head down last. Just so I could take one last look at its hollow eyes before saying goodbye forever. Call it morbid, but I'm just a sentimental person.

Once all the parts were successfully in the trash, I made my way up, hoping that I could get the stench out within the afternoon. Those plans were quickly thrown out, as the horse was back on the kitchen table, exactly as it was before. Well not exactly, the places where I had sawed through the limbs and neck had seemingly healed, to the point where it didn't look rotten at all.

I couldn't take it anymore. All the hours and effort I had put in to getting rid of this pile of rotten bones, just for it to find its way back into my life. As its mocking black voids stared at me, rage filled my body.

I punched it.

I punched the corpse right between its eyes. And then again. And then again.

Blood and gore were spraying onto my beautiful baby blue walls and kitchen cabinets. Skull fragments dug into my knuckles as I kept the punches coming. My white shirt quickly turned to a deep crimson.

The corpse was just a pile of goop by the time I was interrupted by a knock on the door. 

Covered in blood and brains, I open the door.

"Hi?" I asked sheepishly.

"Bio-waste management, we were told about your horse problem, can I come in?" The towering man asked firmly, not even looking up from his clipboard

"No." my answer came out more firm than intended.

He looked up from his clipboard now with a puzzled face, which quickly turned to horror as he saw me.

"Leave." I continued with my new found moxie as I attempted to slam the door in his face, which his foot blocked.

"Son, I'm here to help, what happened."

"I said leave!" I shouted while kicking his foot out of the way and locking the door.

With my heart pounding in my throat, I returned to the depths of my apartment. I could not let them see what I had done, they'd think I was a psychopath! However, I had more pressing matters to attend to.

In my kitchen stood the horse. And not the pile of flesh and gore, not the corpse, no, he was as healthy as, well, a horse.

For just a moment, we stood there, those black voids replaced by pools of crimson as the sun hit the eyes of the beast. We stared at eachother. For just a moment. A calm before the storm. And then, the moment ended.

The beast charged at me, full speed. I dodged it with not even a millisecond to spare. I fell to the floor as the horse rammed into the wall, creating a dent and making all my beautiful artworks on the wall fall.

The horse recovered quicker than me and stood above me. His eyes were not empty and soulless anymore. No, no it was filled with rage and vengeance. As it jumped on its hind legs in preparation to slam its hooves through my heart, I was able to roll out of the way and hop up on my feet. 

I rushed into my bedroom, locking the door and barricading it behind me. I only had two options, and I had to decide quick, as horsey was already ramming into the door trying to break it down. Do I face the horse, or do I risk surviving a fall from the fourth floor. It was a clear choice.

I opened the window and looked down. I could probably aim for the trees down by the street. If I don't get impaled by a branch, It'd probably cushion my fall where I'd get away with minor injuries. No time to think, as the door was slammed open, my barricade did nothing to hinder the stallion.

I took my leap of faith. It only lasted a second, but it could've been hours. I turned around mid air to glance back at the window, and I saw the horse just staring at me before disappearing back into my apartment.

I got away with minor injuries luckily. I stayed with my parents for the next couple of months after the incident. I could not tell them what happened exactly, so I just told them that I needed time away from the city, which was true, nothing better than the fresh countryside air.

I'm still traumatised by what happened on the Sixth of March. I still get freaked out when I see a horse over by the neighbouring ranch. And sometimes, I swear to God, that every now and then, in the middle of the night when even the crickets had gone to sleep, I can hear faint hoofbeats, growing ever louder.
