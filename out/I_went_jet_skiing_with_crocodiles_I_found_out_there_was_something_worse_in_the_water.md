I don’t know how much longer my phone’s gonna hold a signal. The rain’s coming down like sheets of nails now. I contacted emergency twenty minutes ago, and they said they were sending a rescue chopper. But the lightning’s getting closer, the tide’s rising, and something’s moving in the mangroves again.

If I stop writing, it’s because I heard it.  
If this post ends mid-sentence… you’ll know why.

\* \* \* \* \*

I came to Australia for sun, beaches, and adventure. The cliché. I’d been in the far north for two days, still fighting jet lag and loving every second. My hostel roommate told me about this “Croc Jet Safari.” Said it was the wildest thrill ride up north. “Like NASCAR on water,” he joked. I signed up that morning.

We met at the boat ramp under grey skies. The guide, a leathery-skinned guy in his fifties named Wayne, handed us life jackets and yelled over the whine of the engines, “Keep your limbs in! Salties love tourists who forget that part!”

Everyone laughed.  
I didn’t.

We sped out across the estuary—four of us on separate jet skis, Wayne leading. The water was brown and thick, full of debris from last night’s storm. The mangroves loomed ahead, green and ghostly.

The air felt heavy. Charged.

I swear, even before it happened, the birds had gone silent.

\* \* \* \* \*

It started with a bump. Small at first, like hitting driftwood. Then a harder slam from underneath that nearly launched me off the seat. Wayne cut his engine and turned, shouting something I couldn’t hear over the wind.

Then it came again.

Something *huge* rammed the ski broadside. The handlebars cracked against my ribs. I hit the water hard, the world spinning brown and red.

I remember surfacing, spitting salt and mud...and seeing the others’ jet skis whipping circles, their engines screaming. Wayne pointed behind me, his face white.

“MOVE!”

I didn’t see it right away. Not until the water rose behind me, slow and deliberate, like a submarine surfacing. The back of it broke the water first: ridged, black, and slick with algae. Then the head—dear God—the head.

Its snout alone was longer than the jet ski. Teeth like gravestones.

Wayne fired up his engine and tore toward me, yelling to grab on. But before I could, the croc’s tail hit the water with a sound like thunder, flipping the ski onto its side. Wayne disappeared.

I kicked. Hard. Panic turned my limbs mechanical. I swam toward the mangroves, each stroke cutting through oily water. My life jacket tangled on something below—a root or a rope or a goddamn hand, I’ll never know—and I ripped it off.

When I reached the trees, I pulled myself up onto the roots, chest heaving, mud and leeches sticking to my skin.

The rain began again.

And then the lightning came.

\* \* \* \* \*

For a while, I told myself it was gone. That maybe it didn’t care. I crouched there, gripping the trunk of a half-submerged tree, listening to the rain hiss on the water.

But the mangroves moved differently. The still pools rippled—not with wind, but with weight.

Something brushed the roots beneath me. Slow...sliding...

I climbed higher, the bark slick under my hands. A dark shape circled below, vanishing and reappearing between the trunks. It didn’t need to hurry.

The storm cracked overhead, so loud it rattled my bones.

In that flash of white light, I saw it.

\* \* \* \* \*

It wasn’t a normal crocodile. Not by size, not by shape. Its eyes glowed a sickly amber in the lightning—set too far apart, almost on the sides of its skull. The body was bloated, scaled like burnt armour, scarred with old wounds that didn’t look healed so much as *grown over*. The tail was thick as a car, the ridges splitting like old leather with every movement.

It exhaled. I could *hear* it over the thunder—wet, wheezing breaths that fogged the rain around its nostrils.

Then it sank again, silent as a nightmare sliding back under your bed.

I stayed in that tree for what felt like hours. I texted emergency. My GPS barely worked but I dropped a pin anyway. They told me to stay put, that a rescue crew was launching once the lightning cleared.

I kept the screen dim, my hand shaking so hard I could barely type. I thought maybe if I stayed still enough, it’d lose interest.

But predators like that don’t lose interest. They wait.

\* \* \* \* \*

The rain turned from a downpour into a deluge. I could barely see the water below me—just shifting black between flashes. I kept trying to spot the others’ jet skis. Maybe one of them made it. But the estuary looked deserted, except for the endless maze of trees.

Every time lightning flared, I saw something new in the water. Ripples where there shouldn’t be any. A shape that didn’t match the current.

And then I realised the mangroves themselves were moving closer together.

Not from the tide. From *it*.

It was pushing through, breaking roots as thick as my arm, the noise half muffled by thunder. The smell hit me...rot, blood, and swamp.

I thought of all those signs back at the boat ramp: *“Crocodiles inhabit this area. Do not swim.”*  
We laughed.  
We took selfies.

Now I could taste iron in the rain.

\* \* \* \* \*

Lightning again—so bright it turned the world white for a heartbeat.

And in that heartbeat, I saw everything.

The water directly below me had gone still. Perfectly still, like a mirror. But the shadow beneath it wasn’t shaped like a croc anymore. It was longer. Wrong. The head split into something wider, the jaws opening sideways like a grotesque flower, lined with concentric rings of teeth. Inside was movement...like something alive within it, writhing.

And it was looking straight up at me.

I don’t remember screaming, but my throat burns. I think I dropped my phone for a moment because the next thing I knew, it was half submerged in rainwater and flashing low battery. I backed higher onto the branch, praying it would hold.

The last message from the rescue team came eight minutes ago:  
*“Storm too strong. Hold tight. ETA unknown.”*

The wind’s howling now. I can hear something bumping the trunk from underneath. Slow, deliberate thuds, like it’s testing the wood. Each one vibrates through my feet.

I keep thinking about that last flash, the shape beneath me, the impossible mouth.

They said crocs don’t come this far south anymore.  
They said the storms drove them away.

But this thing—this *monster*—didn’t come from here. It came *with* the storm.

Another flash just hit the horizon.  
There’s a shadow on the next trunk over. It’s taller now...**standing.**

If anyone finds this post, don’t come looking.  
Stay out of the water.  
The rain’s stopped. No lightning. Just darkness. 

No thunder. Just silence...  


...except that guttural growl, deep and wrong, and the wet crack of roots as they give way below.
