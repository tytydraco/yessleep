Strangers always used to randomly ask me if I have a twin. I was so confused. Then I met my false twin flame. He mirrored me and life with him was a fairytale for years until it wasn’t. He’s destroying my life. I see Satan in his eyes sometimes. He stalked me at work, harassed me while I was just trying to work and pay my bills, spread rumors in the office behind my back while smiling to my face, sabotaged my career, got me fired but he still wasn’t done. He promised to marry me and begged me to buy a home with him. We made a contract and I invested $90,000 towards the down payment. He said he was about to get a promotion so “the loan” (not gift) we entered into would be no problem for him. Once my twin stepped foot in our new home, he became an entire different person. Our neighbor welcomed us into the neighborhood and my dog who had no prior behavioral issues bit someone for the first time. Her name is Shine and now I know she was trying to warn and protect me. She knew. It was a minor bite but the neighbor dragged on a lawsuit for months, filed a claim against our home insurance, the town put us on watch and came over everyday to make sure Shine was “quarantined”. 

The town hall employee woke every morning starting day 2 and laid on her horn for minutes to wake me up so she could discuss how Shine’s quarantine was going. There’s no cell service in the town so the employee couldn’t call us and make my life easier. I was only allowed to walk Shine in our backyard. We have over an acre and our closest neighbor is a quarter mile away but the couple came running over and screamed at me to get off “their” property. There were signs for the annual “pig roast” everywhere. I would try to relax by going hiking in the mountains but there were signs posted to trees that said “be careful” and “just act normal, just act normal”. I stopped going grocery shopping because random customers took pictures of us. I was constantly asked “have you seen the Truman Show?” “Have you watched Coraline?” “Have you watched the Matrix?” At the gas pump, at coffee shops, at the gym. I was weirded out and stopped leaving the house. 

The energy in the house felt off so I decided to read all of the contracts I signed to buy the house and the deed. My twin hired a lawyer to review them but I needed to see for myself. My twin caught me and kicked me out of our house that I paid for and hasn’t paid me back a dime even though he promised. I hired my own real estate attorney who reviewed all the documents and was told the realtor and my false twin should not be trusted. The house is the scam. I tried to sell it but my twin took down the for sale sign. By now, I had developed PTSD from this twin flame relationship and got approved for SSDI. I can no longer afford the mortgage but no one wants to buy the house. My car registration, car title and passport have gone missing so I can’t drive my car. I’m financially being held hostage and I thought maybe my family didn’t know all of the details but they do and they joined in on mocking me and harassing me. I have no money to hire an attorney or private investigator. I have plenty of evidence but police either don’t show up or I have to beg them to file a police report and then stop taking my calls. Life was great until I met my twin. I barely remember the good times and the past 7 years have been a blur. I’m not religious but felt the need to go to church and was told I’m battling spiritual warfare against my enemies. 

I forget to eat and sleep with the lights on because my dreams consist of my grandma poisoning my food, my father giving me a new legal name “Mason” and serpents covering my body and trying to choke me. I’m figuring out my next move because I need to act strategically. I feel discriminated against because I’m disabled so hopefully the ADA will provide be a pro bono attorney to look into my case. A private investigator would be helpful but unless someone helps me for free, that’s not an option. Unless i misunderstood the definition of twin flame, mine is a false twin flame or a demon impersonating my twin flame. Not sure how he appeared out of nowhere, isolated me, strategically infiltrated every area of my life and managed to divide and conquer my family and leave me with zero support system but this is my life now. I need a vacation. I’m still creeped out that strangers casually asked me if I had a twin but I never took their questions seriously.
