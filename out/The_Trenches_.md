The night was dark and moonless, shrouding the Ukrainian countryside in a suffocating blanket of black. The air was thick with tension, the anticipation of violence humming just beneath the surface. I crouched in the damp, muddy trench, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the whispers of my comrades around me, their voices low and filled with a mix of fear and determination.

It had been two years since the war had begun, two years of relentless fighting and unbearable loss on both sides. The once fertile fields were now a barren wasteland, scarred by bomb craters and littered with the remnants of battle. We had been at a stalemate, but tonight, we planned to reclaim a critical Russian-held trench.

I gripped my rifle tightly, my knuckles white with tension. I could see the faint outlines of my fellow soldiers, their faces grim and resolute. We were all exhausted, our bodies and minds pushed to the brink, but there was no turning back. This was our home, our land, and we would fight to the last breath to defend it.

"Ready?" whispered Ivan, my closest friend and comrade.

I nodded, my jaw set. "Ready."

The signal was given, and we surged forward, our movements quick and silent. We moved like shadows through the night, our footsteps muffled by the mix of sticks and thick mud as this was the wet season. As we approached the Russian trench, the tension became almost unbearable, the silence deafening.

Then, all at once, chaos erupted.

Gunfire shattered the stillness, bullets whizzing through the air. The Russians were caught off guard, their shouts of alarm drowned out by the roar of battle. I charged forward, lifting my rifle and firing a few shots without a clear target, hoping to suppress those down-range.

The night sky was suddenly lit up by the enemy flares as if they were supernovas. I watched as the shadows of the various trees around me suddenly appeared stronger than before, the shadows moving as the flares slowly descended, as if the forest was dancing to the sound of the war.

We approached the trench slowly with the help of an ally Bradley and FPV drones, grenade after grenade being thrown only to move forward mere meters. Each movement was born out of pure desperation.

Upon jumping into the trench, I was met with a scene of utter carnage, bodies fallen, blood mixing with the torn-up mud and brass casings. I aimed my rifle at what I knew to be two dead Russian soldiers and fired a series of control shots, watching the slightest jolts from the bodies to confirm what I already knew.

All around me, my comrades were engaged in similar struggles, their faces twisted with effort and determination. The trench was filled with the sounds of battle, gunfire, screams, and the sickening thud of flesh meeting steel.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the fighting began to subside. We had taken the trench, the remaining Russian soldiers either dead, surrendering, or retreating into the darkness. I stood amidst the violence, my chest heaving with exertion. The adrenaline still coursed through my veins, but a sense of grim satisfaction began to take hold.

"We did it," Ivan said, his voice hoarse and a smile spreading across his face. "We took the trench."

I nodded, but my victory was tempered by the sight around me. The trench was a morgue, the bodies of those fallen strewn haphazardly. The screams of the wounded, soldiers shouting at the surrendered Russians as to why they were here. The stench of death was overwhelming, a putrid mix of blood, gunpowder, and excrement that made my stomach churn.

"Let's start fortifying," I said, trying to push the horror of this senseless war from my mind. "We don't know when they'll counterattack."

We gathered our wits and began reinforcing the trench, grabbing what ammo and supplies we could from the dead. As we worked, the night grew colder, the chill seeping into our bones as the rain started to fall. My breath came in visible puffs, the air still thick with the stench of death.

When the trench was finally secured enough to be deemed safe, whatever that means in a war, groups of people were allowed to sleep in turns. I, among a few other soldiers, drew the short straw and had to stay up to keep watch and alert the rest in case of a counterattack.

I sat in the trench, the buttstock of my rifle resting on the mud below as I looked into the sky, wondering to myself whether my wife and child could see the same stars as me.

"Nikolai," a familiar voice said, startling me from my thoughts, "you good brother?" I turned my head to see none other than Ivan. "I couldn't be better," a small chuckle escaping my lips as I cracked a smile. Ivan looked at me with a concerned face as he noticed the slight tremor in my hand.

Quickly noticing this, I scrambled to grab a packet of cigarettes, lighting one and taking a big draw. "Withdrawals, am I right?" I said unconvincingly.

"So what are you doing here anyway?" I started, getting tired of the oppressive silence. "You're meant to be sleeping with the other lot."

"I couldn't sleep, so I traded shifts with one of the guys," Ivan responded.

"And here I thought you could sleep through anything."

"Fuck you," Ivan responded as we both laughed.

We sat across from each other, sharing cigarettes and stories of life before the war to distract from the situation we were currently in.

It was then that we first heard it, a stick snapping from somewhere beyond the trees. Both Ivan and I, thinking this could be the Russians trying to counterattack, picked up our rifles, called it in over the radio, and readied ourselves for whatever happened next.

We collectively saw nothing but heard some form of movement just beyond what we could see in the darkness of night.

Suddenly, a cry for help could be heard from the darkness of the forest.

"Help! Please help me! Oh God!"

The sound of the man screaming sounded uniquely off, almost like Russian, but not quite right. The words were legible, but they sounded like they came from a source that didn't quite understand what they were saying or how to annunciate the words correctly.

We both froze, our eyes darting around in confusion and fear.

"What the fuck was that?" Ivan whispered, his voice trembling.

"I don't know," I replied, gripping my rifle tightly. "Shoot anything that moves."

The cries for help came again, louder this time, and closer. It was unlike anything we had ever heard, an uncanny sound that sent a primal fear coursing through our veins. The men that were once asleep were now awake and had already formed a defensive line, eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement.

Then, out of the shadows, it emerged.

The creature was a nightmarish abomination, a grotesque fusion of man and beast. Its skin was stretched and sickly white, with crimson blood clinging to its emaciated frame. Its eyes reflected with an orange-yellow once the flashlight lit it up, and its mouth was filled with rows of jagged, razor-sharp teeth.

"What the fuck is that thing!?" Ivan shouted, saying out loud what most everyone else was thinking.

"Help! Oh God somebody help me!" The distorted wails continued as it moved with a fluid grace, its long, clawed fingers flexing as it approached.

For a moment, we were too stunned to react. The creature was like something out of a fever dream, a monstrous apparition that defied explanation.

"Open fire!" I shouted, my voice cutting through the paralyzing fear.

The trench erupted in gunfire, the bullets tearing through the night, the forest illuminated once more with the flashes of gunfire. The creature moved with impossible speed, dodging and weaving through the hail of bullets. It leapt into the midst of the men, its claws slashing and rending with terrifying precision.

I watched in horror as the creature tore through my comrades, their screams mingling with the sickening sounds of ripping flesh and snapping bones. The beast, now covered in blood and gore and riddled with countless bullet holes, seemed unfazed.

"What the fuck do we do, Nikolai?" Ivan started. "Our bullets aren't doing shit!"

Ivan and I backed up to avoid the aggression of the beast while still laying down fire.

The creature turned its gaze to us and lunged toward us.

We both desperately scrambled to try and get out of its sights. I tripped over a Russian corpse among the chaos, falling hard to the ground.

Before I could even come to terms with my inevitable fate, the creature ran over me, knocking my head and stepping on my arm and breaking it, the snap audible. Pain exploded through me as I lifted my head to look at the damage, noticing my arm was badly twisted. I then turned my attention to the thing only to see it pursuing Ivan.

With little to no ease, the nightmarish abomination caught up with Ivan, jumping on his back and slamming him to the mud. I, in my concussed state of mind, only conscious due to the searing pain in my arm, watched as Ivan was lifted into the air, still screaming and thrashing, and grabbing at the beast's claws.

"Oh fuck, please, help. Nikolai!" Ivan screamed.

With one swift movement, it tore into Ivan's stomach, an audible squishing sound could be heard as his innards sprawled all over the floor beneath him. I, wavering in and out of consciousness, could do nothing more but watch.

The sight of Ivan’s lifeless body filled me with dread. I knew I would be next to suffer such a horrific fate.

I put my head down, trying not to draw any attention to myself. Thoughts of my wife and little girl flooded my mind. How would they cope if I died? Would they ever know the details of what happened here?


The beast turned its attention to me, its glowing eyes locking onto my mangled body as it approached, looking for any signs of life. It got on all fours and put its head next to mine.

"Oh fuck, please help. Nikolai!" It crudely imitated.

I lay there, deathly still to avoid suspicion. It lifted its head to the still-audible wailing of one of the soldiers, then leaped in to finish the job. The sound of tearing flesh and snapping bones filled the otherwise silent night.

After the cries were cut short, the air was still. A screeching noise unlike anything else pierced the silence.

I waited for what seemed like an eternity for the creature to be satisfied with its bloodshed and leave. After thirty minutes, I finally began to attempt to move.

The trench was a scene of utter chaos, the air thick with the smell of blood and gunpowder, the ground slick with gore. I stumbled through the horror show until I reached someone with a radio. Most of the people before me were unidentifiable, making it hard to pinpoint whose radio I was using.

"This is Nikolai Dmytrenko. We need immediate evac. Multiple dead. I repeat, we need immediate evac."

What seemed like a lifetime to me was merely seconds in real time. Finally, a response came.

"This is Mykola. Roger that."

That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in an unfamiliar place.

"Where am I?" I barely murmured as I tried to pick myself up.

A sharp jolt of pain ripped through me, and I fell back onto my back, gasping audibly.

"Shit, he's awake!" an unfamiliar voice shouted.

I looked at the source of my pain to find my arm severed just above the elbow, wrapped in bandages.

"I wasn't sure if you'd wake up, Dmytrenko," the man in the white gown stated.

"Where am I?"

"You're in a hospital, Dmytrenko."

"How did I get here?"

"Well, your fellow soldiers brought you back here after you sent out a message for an evac."

The memories hit me all at once. I tried to sit up again, pain jolting through me once more.

"Please, Mr. Dmytrenko, take it easy. Your body is still recovering from your injuries."

"Where is everyone else?" I asked through gritted teeth.

The doctor's face noticeably changed upon hearing this.

"I'm afraid you were the only survivor."

I grimaced upon hearing this, survivor’s guilt washing over me like a wave.

"We had to amputate your arm above the elbow; there was simply no saving it. You also had quite the nasty head wound. I don't know what happened, but whatever it was, your helmet saved your life. It'll be a long and tough road with physical therapy, but you will make a full recovery, Mr. Dmytrenko," the doctor explained.

Noticing my pitiful situation, the doctor handed me a phone to call my family.

And now you guys are all caught up. I've not called my family yet because I've been trying the type this all out. 

You wouldn't believe how hard it is typing with one hand.

While I'm thankful to of made it out alive for my families sake, I can't help but break down asking myself why I lived and the others didn't.

I don't know if you could help me, maybe this was all for nothing but if even one of you could maybe help me identify the thing I saw, maybe I could relay that to the Ukrainian forces and hit it with everything we got and take that fuckin thing down for good.
