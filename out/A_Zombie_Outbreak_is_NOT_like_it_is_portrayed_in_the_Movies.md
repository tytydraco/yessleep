TW: Blood, Gore, Animal Death, even more Gore, and Suicide, come on, have you ever seen a George Romero Movie?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I held the Gun firmly, my Index Finger sat straight just above the Trigger. I adjusted my collar and moved over to my Tie. The Military Vest hung tightly over my Shoulders, and on it, was a Gas Mask attached.

After the two men in fancy Suits stopped talking, one of them turned to us and nodded. We instantly began marching through the dark, grey Halls with blinding white Lights overhead. It smelled so rotten in here, and no wonder honestly. We were working with dead people, literally!

The Walk was short, we turned a few Corners and were at a Door. One of the Men slid in a Keycard and the Door began opening. He turned to us again and, once again, nodded. We had a weird fucking way of communicating.

We put the Gas Masks over our Faces, making sure there were absolutely ZERO ways of anything getting inside of our Uniform. It was way easier to realize with the two Scientists, aka Guys with suits I mentioned, that the Gas Masks literally covered our ENTIRE Head.

We entered the Room, and before were some Tables, Lab Equipment, and a massive part of the Room cut off by Glass. Inside that Glass? A Dead fucking SWAT Officer.

One of the Scientists pulled out a Jar and the other Guy flipped a Switch on the Side of the Glass Wall. The one holding the Jar opened it, and as fast as possible put the open Jar in the round Hole. All I could see that came out of that Jar were tiny black Spots.

But those black Spots are NOT what you think, they are actually Black Worms. What do they do? Guess by the Title of this.

The little Worms moved down the Glass Wall, and onto the Shoe of the dead Officer, they climbed onto his Pants and moved up. They got on hit Shirt, and before any of us knew it, they had climbed INSIDE of the Ear.

After the Worm got inside the Corpse we all knew what was gonna happen. We all just watched and waited, but as soon as we heard the first cracking of Bones, we smiled. The Corpse suddenly began standing up, Bones cracking. I bet you probably have seen this happen before. Train to Busan, World War Z, etc.

Except, this wasn't some Bullshit Hollywood Famous-Actor-Needed-Paycheck-To-Pay-This-Months-Rent Disaster Horror, no, I was actually witnessing the dead Rise to their Feet.

Once the Corpse was fully on its Feet again it began growling, spitting all over the Glass. One of the other Guards aimed his Steyr AUG, specifically designed for fucking ripping open a Human Head, but one of the Scientists told him to stop.

The Muzzle of his Rifle instantly went down. Just after that, the Walking Dead (Get it?) lunged at the Lightswitch, desperately trying with all his might to break the Glass but to no avail.

Let me tell you, this Zed was not one of those Hollywood ones, it was smart. VERY. One of the previous Tests done with this had several Tools placed in the Chamber of one of these, and it picked out the sharpest Tool and started stabbing the Glass. Some Scientists said they could hear the beating on the Glass until the very next Day.

One of the Scientists went out of the room, while the other stayed, and pulled out a Screwdriver. He flipped the Switch, Hole was made and the Zed instantly lunged at it. The Scientist literally handed over the Screwdriver, and the Zombie calmly took it, retracting its Arms back into the Chamber to inspect it.

It was just enough time to close the Hole. Luckily the Zed was almost Laser focused on the Screwdriver, its Fingers moved up and down until it poked itself with the Tip. That's when the Neuron activation happened.

It poked itself one more time, and then another, then another until it looked up again. It began banging really hard on the Glass. That's when the Sweat came in. I became kind of scared. Just this actively decomposing, walking Thing banging on GLASS with a SCREWDRIVER. I don't know, laws of Nature being broken are kinda creepy.

My thinking was interrupted by the second Scientist coming in with a live Squirrel flailing in his Hands. Now now, dear reader, you just ignore the fact that we just had live Squirrels, god forbid, other animals for this exact kind of situation.

Once again, the switch was flipped, and once again, the Zed just politely took the screeching Squirrel. We were forced to just stare as the thing put it on the Ground, and started drilling a Hole into its Ear.

The Zed realized it was drilling into nothing, so it instead started drilling into the Head. After a while of screeching, the Squirrel stopped.

It was almost like the Zombie smiled before it gloriously began drooling and spitting in the Hole. Still, any kind of movement made by us was stopped by a single lifted Hand from one of the Scientists, so we continued on watching as this "Miracle", in heavy quote marks, of Nature happened.

The Room was ghost-quiet except for the loud spitting of the Zombie. It stood up, staring at the Squirrel until it also rose once again. It began running around the Chamber, jumping off the Glass Walls and yet we continued on starring.

The Smell was becoming unbelievably horrid, it was like the Smell of rotting Fish and Milk made hundreds of times worse. But the Scientists were unaffected and in fact, were clapping. "Great! We will transport this Specimen to Russia for further Testing." One of the Scientists exclaimed.

"And Sire, why exactly Russia?" One of the other Soldiers asked, slightly confused. "We have so many places we can test, why do you think they built this Facility?" He continued.

"It's Colder there." The Scientist said. "It's as simple as that, Searg."

"Mhm." The Seargent answered.

"I guess our work today is done, Eh?"  I asked, with tiredness in my Voice.

"It sure is." The Scientist replied. "We'll be keeping these two Alive, however. We need to do further Testing."

"How are we gonna Transport it?" I asked.

"Helicopter, it may not be the safest way but it sure as Hell will not be as Complicated, or Obvious as a Plane. We can't let the Public know a Rabies Zombie Worm exists!" The Scientist replied, before being cut off: "Don't use the Z Word, alright?"

The Scientist shrugged: "Of course, of course."

"But still, here from northern Kazahkstan to our Correspondents in Siberia is quite the Way, especially with Heli." The Searg Argued.

"The Armed Forces of the Republic and the Russian Armed Forces will keep the Heli supplied with Fuel, at least that's how we planned it. Oh well... you boys can go. Thanks for overseeing us."

"Understood." We replied before Saluting and exiting the Room. While walking through the Hallway we were discussed like never before. I was really concerned. "He said it was not the safest way, some shit could fall down and the Worms will crawl up someone's Ass!"

"Jesus fucking Christ. Mister Hollywood over here! Do you think one or two Infected is gonna start an Apocalypse? Unless they learn to do the fucking Worm you could chop off both Arms and Legs and the only Danger would be a fucking Tripping Hazard!"

Fuckin' Nerd.

"Oh well, I'm not really in the Mood to Argue.

"Your right, wanna Watch Night of the Living Dead later?"

"Movie Night? Hell yeah! But maybe something else, I don't wanna watch Zo-"

"Don't say the Z Word!"

&#x200B;

Rapid Footsteps scurry across the Floor. The Scientist Tie flutters next to his Head as he barely misses other People and Objects. It's 13:56 the next Day. He's carrying a Radio, that's blasting out an Emergency Alert.

He stops next to a Guard. "Is the Commanding Officer here?" He asks.

"Yeah, he's currently in the Break Room Briefing some Government Guys on the Parasite." The Guard explains.

"Shit! Shit! Shit!" The Scientists begin running even faster now. The Guard looks at him dumbly.

As the Scientist reaches the Break Room, he fears the Officer explaining:

"It can only be transferred through exchange of Bodily Liquids, excluding Spe-"

The Officer is cut off by the Scientist smashing through the Door like a Battering Ram. He whispers something to the Officer, who promptly responds with a "Holy shit! What?"

The Minister of Health begins listening closely to the Radio. His Arms begin shaking like an Earthquake after hearing what the Alert said: "The Bilenowish Hospital at the Water Tower is under Quarantine, the CDC will be taking care of the Infection soon. It seems to be a kind of Rabies Virus as Patients Infected have been shown to be Aggressive."

The Minister of Health stands up. "Sire." He says, looking at the Officer. "Rabies has a 99% Mortality rate, right?"

The Officer looks to the Minister. "Uhm. Please, excuse me for a Moment."

He and the Scientist leave the room. "Fucking how?" The Officer says.

"We have no idea, Alex. We need to deploy our Outbreak Containment Units now!"

The Radio continues blasting.

"First of all, just fucking say OCU, second of all of course! But it will take a while. We shoot first and ask questions later. The only question I ask now is how widespread is it?"

"Currently only the Hospital and our Boys at the Police Department are following all Measures but they need Support."

"Then call the Armed Forces of the Republic and tell them to get there."

"But that would make it even more Suspicious! Fucking Social Media already caught onto this and the People demand Answers! Luckily the Boys will cut off the Internet very soon. We got lucky we have everyone in the town aside from Pedestrians in on this."

"Shoot first ask questions later!"

"I wasn't even asking a fucking Question! We never had an Outbreak. Ever since 86' the Parasite has been restricted to this Facility... and before that to some fucking Spiders."

"You'll need to get Henryk in, hes second in Command. He needs to organize the whole Operation. I still got around 24 Minutes in my Presentation."

"We need to cut off Information from spreading. Luckily the Info has not yet gone out. Only the Town knows."

&#x200B;

The Officer returned to the Break Room. "Ladies and Gentlemen. It is of most importance that we cut this off. It seems that a small Outbreak has occurred within Bilenowish.

The entire room gasped, instantly, both the Minister of Health and Minister of Defence stand up. The Minister of Health nods to the Minister of Defence and he begins speaking. "How come?"

"We do not yet know, all we know is that we need to start controlling this. The United Nations will address this and you Guys will have to get the Armed forces of the Republic in before our OCUs can be deployed." The officer answers.

The Minister of Health opens his Lips but is interrupted by an Alarm going off in the Facility, the Intercom instantly starts blasting: "ATTENTION, ATTENTION. AN OUTBREAK OF 'THE ROMERO STRAIN' HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE TOWN OF BILENOWISH. THE CURRENT STATE IS UNKNOWN ALTHO SOME CLAIM THE TOWN HAS ALREADY REACHED STAGE 1 CATASTROPHE. ALL ARMED PERSONNEL IS NOW REQUIRED TO BEGIN MOBILIZATION. THE COMMANDING OFFICERS WILL BEGIN MAPPING OUT A PLAN. THIS IS NOT  DRILL."

The Officer speaks before the Minister: "Shoot First, ask questions later."

Or at least that's how it went.

&#x200B;

The Gun fell into my Hand as the Seargent threw it off the Wall. "Kazakh Military Gears' in French Sector." He explained. "No shit, Sherlock," I mumbled under my Breath. A Scientist suddenly opened the Door and said: "Poles are getting Teamed up with the Japanese. They're gonna meet you at the Entrance to the Japanese Sector."

"Aye, aye, Sir!" I and the Searg said at the same time. The Scientist ran out of the Room. Jeez, was it really that bad? Stage 1 Catastrophe? Just get the Flamethrowers in, I thought. My rambling was interrupted by a Frenchmen passing our Room and throwing a Kazakh Military Uniform on the Ground. The Searg shouted: "Have some respect, Frenchie!"

We quickly changed our Uniform and ran to the Japanese Sector, where both the entire Japanese and Polish Squads were waiting. The Commanding Officer was explaining the Plan: Get in, do some Murder, Get out. Simple as Pie!

Once the Commanding Officer was done explaining, we all cried out, either with Joy or without. There would be two Outcomes, and we all knew it: The death of the Living or, the Death of the Living Dead.

&#x200B;

"Set the Mood, Searg." The Helicopter Pilot shouted. "You got it, boss." was the response. The Searg began rotating the Volume Button on the Boom-Box. A little Screen showed the Title of the Song that was to, quote: Set the Mood.

The Ride of the Valkyries began blasting at full Volume from multiple Helicopters just as they were lifting off. On the Ground, dozens of Men waved at Us and saluted Us. Dozens of little Flags on their Uniforms. The Union Jack, 50 Stars, Tri-Colors, Nordic Crosses, you named it. Racism is basically impossible at a Place like here, I thought and smirked.

The Music just managed to overpower the Helicopter Blades, the Lights turned Red as the Doors shut. The setting Sun shined through the little Windows the Gunners had. One of the other Poles in the Heli signed took off his Helmet and sat on it. The Searg pointed it out: "Oi! What the hell are you doing sitting on your Helmet?" "I'm saving my Testicles til' later, Searg."

We all held back our laughing.

"How long to Bilenowich again?" One Soldier asked. "Hm, about 76 Kilometers. We got lucky that we found a little Secluded Area like here to set up Camp." Another answered.

The Ride of the Valkyries began coming to an end, and so more classical Music replaced it. We all waited, the whirring of the Blades was like a Scream, overpowered by cynical laughter. We should be taking this more seriously instead of listening to fucking Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

Time continued on to pass, Piece of Music after Piece of Music, until a Red Light turning green caught all of our attention, a Voice from a Megaphone overpowered the combined forces of the Music and Helicopters: Poles will be teaming up with some Russian Volunteers on the Roof, Japs will help the Police on the Ground.

The Helis began to enter the Town, the Streets were empty, and everyone was fortified in their House in case something got out of Control. We quickly thereafter reached the Hospital and began landing on the Roof, several Russian Soldiers stationed at the City awaited our Arrival.

"Get out!" the Voice of the Captain echoed through the entire Machine, we unbuckled ourselves and jumped out. "Down their things are out of Control." One of the Russians said. "Lucky you got the Guns that blow Brains out."

"At least your not doing a whole Week worth of Workouts carrying that thing." Was the response. We kicked in the Door to enter the Hospital, we signalled to the Police and Japanese below to also enter, and at the same time our Feet entered the Hospital.

&#x200B;

"Hostile, 4 54 O'clock or somethin', I don't know!" One of the Poles said before promptly firing at a Charging Man in a Hospital Gown, he had a Bite taken out of his Skull, before there was a giant one in his face at least. He was covered in Blood a huge amount of Blood, if the man went swimming he would attract an entire Ocean's worth of Sharks. We continued on, meeting several scared Hospital Workers.

I entered a Room after being commanded to enter it, and what I found was pure Horror. A Hospital Worker was tearing apart the Throat of a Dead Police, not necessarily ripping off the Neck, but damaging it bad. Like a Zombie would, it began devouring the Flesh, eating it like a fucking Animal, I simply stood there in Shock as the thing took a massive bite of the Scalp and began drooling and spitting blood into it.

I couldn't blink, I couldn't do anything I wanted to move but my body wouldn't. Out of nowhere, the Dead Cop raised his Head and began shrieking, attracting the attention of the Worker. It turned to me and began charging, I threw myself back, crashing into the Door and landing in the Hallway. Luckily another Soldier was there and Shot the thing directly in the Head.

The Bullet whizzed and crashed just a few Centimeters next to my Head, a little Shrapnel penetrated my Helmet and my Ears rang. Fucking god, they rang so much. I could not hear anything, A little of my Vision began going White, as if God had just entered the fucking Room.

The Soldier ran to me, before promptly stepping on wherever the Blood of the Thing had gotten. Standard Procedure. I pointed to the Room, and the Policeman stood up and growled at me, before also getting taken out.

The Soldier helped me up, and we continued down the Hallway, the Bullets fire simply becoming Background noise for the fucking Ringing. "I can't fucking hear anything!" I said after seeing the other Soldiers' Lips moving.

The entire Hospital was full of Gore. Several Soldiers had taken their Revolver and shot themselves after getting Bit so they wouldn't turn into one of them. It was fucking depressing, let me tell you, I felt like Logan Paul in Japan.

We continued clearing the Hospital we encountered basically Zero more Casualties, disregarding the Zombies we killed. We continued meeting other Soldiers, and eventually, we found the last Zed.

An Injured Man in a Hospital Gown, Ironically he was Patient Zero. The Sheriff was called over, and we all took a step back, everyone involved in this whole Operation, Japs, Poles, Russians, Kazakhs, you name it, and just like that a shot was fired, Blood splattered all over the Wall and a clean Tear was made into the Things Skull. Just like, it was all over. No big Finale, no giant Zombie King, we did it, surprisingly NOT how we were told: we did it Quickly and Loudly.

&#x200B;

The Population was very understanding as to why we did it because we did not tell them the Truth.

A new String of Rabies was discovered, and they got Aggresive, and we shot em' up. Luckily, the News did not make it far, such a Historic Event to be seen as a Creepypasta, or Urban Legend. "The  Bilenowish Virus.", "Rabies." I can already Imagine a post being made on Reddit, altho I think this is it.

A private Investigation was Launched as to how the Outbreak Occurred. Turns out that the Scientist was right, Helicopter was not the safest way. A Sample, for some reason, carried in Mason Jars (don't fucking ask) fell off the Heli after not begin strapped on properly, the Glass Broke, and the Worms escaped. The Person who did it was called an Idiot and was sent to Jail.

"It's okay to make Mistakes!" My Ass. This little slip-up killed Dozens and Traumatized almost 100 Personnel for Life. The Facility is thinking of being Shut Down, we needed to Murder every single Sample we had, and then burn it. A few days after the end of the Operation we all gathered outside and Watched the Corpses and Jars burn. We kept the Fire alive for a whole Day!

The masses were fooled, "Dangerous Virus! We had no choice!". Protests were done, but it was prevalent for a little over a Week. Our funding has been cut, and in this disarray, I took the chance to Upload this. The Truth cannot be held back. Henryk and Alexander can suck it up, cause I'm gonna post this.

On an ending note, don't listen to Hollywood. They teach us Bullshit. If I ever see another Hollywood Zombie Movie I'm going to break whatever it is playing on. And don't even get me started on the upcoming Train to Busan American Remake, Oh Boy! I hated Peninsula enough.

So, in case your ever caught watching a Shit-Show Zombie Movie on the Big Screen, remember this Quote:

"*This is only a Work of Fiction. The truth, as always, will be far Stranger." -* Alex C. Clark
