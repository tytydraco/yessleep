It began like any other day. I woke up late, the sunlight filtering weakly through my blinds. I had no particular plans—just the usual routine of scrolling through my phone, sipping some coffee, and maybe taking a walk on the beach later. It wasn’t until I noticed the time that I realized it was nearing lunchtime. My stomach growled, reminding me I hadn’t eaten since breakfast. A sudden craving hit me for something simple, something nostalgic—the Krusty Krab.

I hadn’t been there in a while, but I remembered the way the place smelled, the sound of the grill sizzling, the warm, fried patties served by the cheerful employees. It was a staple of my childhood, a comforting spot by the beach where everything always felt okay. I’d heard rumors that the restaurant had undergone some renovations recently, but I didn’t pay much attention to the gossip. It was just the Krusty Krab—a family-friendly, cartoonish eatery.

As I walked toward the restaurant, the street seemed unusually quiet. The air felt heavy, almost thick, and there was a strange stillness to the world around me. I shrugged it off. Maybe it was just one of those days when everyone else was inside, avoiding the scorching midday sun. But the moment I reached the door of the Krusty Krab, a chill ran down my spine.

The usual flickering neon sign was absent. The windows, usually clear and inviting, were clouded over. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, unsure if I should go in. But my stomach reminded me it was time to eat, so I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The air hit me first—it was thick, dense, and smelled wrong. It wasn’t the fresh scent of grilled seafood or the greasy fryers I remembered. This was rancid, like burnt plastic mixed with something I couldn’t place. It made my stomach turn, but I convinced myself it was just a bad batch of something cooking.

The restaurant was empty—eerily so. The booths were deserted, the tables untouched. The usual cheerful music was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence that seemed to weigh on me. It was as if the whole place was holding its breath.

Then I saw him. Behind the counter, standing motionless, was SpongeBob SquarePants.

But not the cheerful, animated sponge I remembered from the cartoons. His once-bright yellow color was faded, almost gray, and his square body was crooked, like he had been left in the sun too long. His eyes were wide, unblinking, with an unsettling gleam—like they were staring through me. The usual goofy grin that defined him was replaced by something darker, a grimace stretched unnaturally wide.

“Welcome to the Krusty Krab,” he said, his voice too deep, too slow, like it was being dragged out from somewhere dark. “How may I serve you today?”

I blinked, unsure how to respond. Something in my gut told me I should leave, but the hunger gnawing at me wouldn’t let me. "Uh… I’ll have the Krusty Krab Deluxe," I managed to say, trying to sound normal.

SpongeBob didn’t answer right away. He just turned slowly toward the grill, his movements jerky, unnatural. He seemed to be staring at the empty grill, as if waiting for something. Or someone.

My heart skipped a beat, and I looked around, hoping to see someone else—someone who could reassure me this was all normal. But there was only silence, the sound of my own breathing filling the void.

I noticed a shadow moving near the door leading into the back of the kitchen. Squidward.

But he wasn’t the grumpy cashier I remembered. He looked… wrong. His skin had turned a sickly purple, dark veins bulging out of his face and tentacles. His once narrow eyes were wide, bloodshot, and sunken in his skull. His mouth was stretched into a twisted grin, showing jagged teeth that shouldn’t belong to a cartoon character.

“Another customer?” Squidward rasped, his voice coming out hoarse and unnatural. “Looks like SpongeBob’s got this one. Lucky you.”

He chuckled, but it wasn’t a normal laugh. It was deep, guttural, as if the sound of it was being dragged from the bottom of a well.

I didn’t know what to do. I felt frozen to the spot, unable to move or speak. The smell of burnt food thickened in the air, and the silence between us grew heavier. And then I heard it—the faintest sound. A growl, low and rumbling, coming from the back of the restaurant. It was distant at first, but as the seconds ticked by, it grew louder.

My blood ran cold.

SpongeBob turned to me, his grin widening even further, revealing rows of sharp, yellow teeth. “It’s almost ready,” he said, his voice slow, deliberate, like he was savoring each word. “The special… just for you.”

My skin crawled. Something was terribly wrong here. I could feel it in my bones. This was not the Krusty Krab I remembered. This wasn’t even real anymore.

Before I could move, I felt the cold, bony hand of Squidward brush against my shoulder. “You’re going to love it,” he whispered in my ear, his breath foul and rancid. “We don’t get many visitors these days.”

I jerked away from him, but it was too late. The restaurant door slammed shut behind me, and the windows went dark, the world outside disappearing into blackness. I was trapped.

“Mr. Krabs?” I gasped, desperate for someone, anyone, who might be normal here. 

But when Mr. Krabs appeared from the back, my blood ran cold. His body was bloated, grotesque, with a cracked, discolored red shell that looked like it had been left to rot in the sun. His eyes were wide and crazed, filled with hunger, with an insatiable thirst for something I couldn’t understand. His claws were massive, dripping with thick, black goo that splattered onto the floor.

“Ah, there ye are, lad,” he growled, his voice deep and full of malice. “We’ve been waiting for you.”

I tried to run, but SpongeBob’s hand shot out, grabbing me with terrifying speed. His fingers were ice cold, and they dug into my flesh, pulling me closer. “You can’t leave,” he murmured, his voice sickeningly sweet. “You’re part of the menu now.”

I struggled against him, my body shaking with panic, but I couldn’t escape. Squidward’s tentacles wrapped around my legs, squeezing tightly, while Mr. Krabs advanced, his claws clicking together with an ominous rhythm. The growling from the back of the restaurant was deafening now, echoing through the walls, shaking the very foundation of the place.

Suddenly, the walls seemed to pulse with life. I realized too late that this was no restaurant. It was a trap. It was alive. The Krusty Krab was a living, breathing thing, and it was hungry.

“You’ll be part of the stew,” Mr. Krabs sneered, as he grabbed my arm, his claws digging into my flesh. “We don’t serve just anyone, you know.”

The growling grew louder, closer, and before I could fully comprehend what was happening, the kitchen doors burst open. From the darkness stepped a massive, monstrous figure. It was a twisted, rotting version of a sea creature, covered in slick, black scales, its teeth jagged and too numerous to count.

“No!” I screamed, trying to pull away, but the grip of the others was too strong. The creature approached, its massive form towering over me, its eyes glowing with a malicious hunger.

And then it spoke, its voice a deep, guttural rasp. “Dinner is served.”

I gasped, the air leaving my lungs, and just as I was about to be consumed by the thing, everything went dark.

I awoke with a jolt, gasping for air, my body drenched in sweat. The room was familiar—the soft light of morning filtering through the blinds, the distant hum of traffic outside—but my heart was racing, and I felt a tight knot in my stomach.

It had been a nightmare. Just a nightmare. A twisted, horrifying dream, nothing more.

I sat up slowly, breathing deeply to calm myself. I glanced around my room, disoriented, still trying to shake the lingering terror of the dream. The Krusty Krab, SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs—all of them turned into monstrous figures, their grotesque smiles seared into my mind.



No. It was just a dream. Just a nightmare.


I swore to myself that I’d never watch that show again. No more SpongeBob, no more Krusty Krab.

But as I lay back down, I heard it again. The growl I heard inside that nightmare. And this time, it sounded closer.

I pulled the blanket tightly around me, eyes wide with terror, as I realized the nightmare wasn’t finished yet.

It was still waiting.
