The floor of the cell is covered in decades of mildew and dust. This disgusting carpet does nothing to dull the pain as I skip across it, thrown in by someone with the intention of making a point. 

My Name’s Mike, and if any of you are the types to go on a deep dive, you probably know A little about me already. 

For those of you that don’t, Jesus I don’t know exactly where to begin. 

The Cliff’s notes would be that I spent a little over a decade either being a serial killer or a vigilante. I won’t try to justify my actions, both of those are just sides of the same shitty coin. I’m not a person to be idolized or emulated, so I choose not to plead my case. 

Now, while I thought that was just about as screwed up as life could get, one day, out of the blue, after burying my best, fuck, my only friend I found myself, somewhere else. A world that looked and felt like mine, but one where the things that go bump in the night actually existed. 

Where I came from, I’d seen monsters, to be sure, but only the kind that happen when people break. 

Since I’ve been here? Got caught up in some demented gameshow for demons or something,  threw a massive shit in the punch bowl of the thing running the production, and got the world’s unluckiest man his freedom. 

And that leads me to my current situation, staring down the rage filled, mildly bruised face of that asshole, that fucking, demonic Ted Turner, Art. 

He runs a hand aggressively through his slicked back hair, standing at the door to my cell. 

“Looks like your little plan didn’t work, exactly as I predicted, you fuck. 

I mean, great try with the little cat thing you had, honestly didn’t see that coming. But, Jesus, Mike, what was your end game? “ Art gloats. 

“Cards on the table? It was a lot better, but shit fell through, that whiskey abomination,  it was the one that ratted me out I assume? 

That being said, still got Kev out. And you can’t really ‘flip off his lightswitch’ if he didn’t let you screw around with his wiring, can you? “ I grin, I keep it, even as a Gucci shoe slams into my face. 

Am I scared? Of God damn course I am, I’ve been pissing myself (metaphorically speaking.) since I realised that the rules of reality don’t really apply any more. 

Every new grain of sand on the beach of hell my life has become, tosses me further down the road of mental failure. Shit, that’s half of what fucked up my last plan in the first place. 

If I could have just kept my shit together long enough, I’d be sipping a beer with Kev in some shit hole town somewhere. But the only thing harder than trying to stamp down fear in the face of God’s and monsters, is trying to do it while projecting some kind of ‘death fears me ‘ persona. 

Between you and I? Death doesn’t fear me, in fact, it seems to love to hang around. And every day I have to stare down that grim spectre, the closer I get to losing the tenuous grip on reality I have . 

“Oh, fuck Kev. He’s smart enough to stay off my radar, and too stupid to figure out a way to come back at me. 

He's got a 1 bedroom in Idaho or something? Salud, good on him. 

You, I had high hopes for, and then you decide to wipe your ass all over my carpet, cost me more than I could even explain, and even, get me a little roughed up. My favorite shell, anyway. 

I want to recoup some loses Mike. So, you, get to be a part of another one of my projects. 

You thought The Path was bad? Oh, you literal, fucking clown, you haven’t seen anything. 

I won’t spoil it for you, the devil’s in the details and all, but you know what everyone loves?

Prison. 

Not being in it themselves, of course, but seeing others, especially those they hate in there. 

This place isn’t fair, the path was a boxing match with Queensbury rules, this is a handcuffed knife fight. 

And I can’t wait to see you figure out, all the little surprises it has in store for you. “ Art laughs and tosses me a battered, ancient looking smartphone, “ Feel free to drum me up some good press online if you want. “

My heart is pounding, I have to use every bit of will I have to stop from shaking, to roll my neck and sit against the cold, padless cement bed behind me. 

I feel sick, my stomach boiling and gurgling. 

“For the love of whatever the demonic equivalent of Christ is, why not just kill me? I’m right here, I have no way of fighting back, and you know damn well that if you give me enough time, I’m going to find a way to wipe my ass on your doorframe next. “ My tone is flippant, or at least, I hope it is. 

“The ego on you kid, you think you’re that guy don’t you? 

They exist, don’t get me wrong, probably a couple thousand folks capable of taking me out, but trust me, you are not one of them. 

This isn’t some ‘Arch’ idiocy where I leave my greatest rival alive. This is me watching you squirm because I can, and making a little profit on the deal. 

Don’t flatter yourself. “ Art has produced a long thin knife as he talks, he spins and rolls it absently. 

“Before your guys dragged me off, I met something. A corner store, I don’t know if it was haunted, possessed, or if it was some kind of creature that just decided to look like a knock off 7-11. 

Point being, it was out there, ethereal, I couldn’t hurt it, outwit it, even slow it down. I ran from that thing as fast as I could. It gave me some serious Lovecraft vibes. 

You, Art, are not that guy. “ I notice myself tapping my finger nervously on the slime covered floor, I focus, stopping the tic. 

The tip of Art’s knife glows, the sick, grey sheen isn’t heat, but something that makes me start to back up. 

“I am, but you will never see that. You’re not worth the effort. 

I want to give you a little something though. “ Art stalks toward me, I stand as I back into the farthest corner of the cell, “ Proud of your face paint were you? “

Art grins, and for a moment lets some of his true self slip through. For just a moment I see timeless horror in his eyes, a dark black void of consumed souls and unrestrained evil. 

That knife parts my flesh with pain like a whip. Without even using the blade, it’s presence flenses my face, opening up raw, textured furrows in my flesh. 

He leaves after he is done, laughing to himself. 

The pain makes me black out, my stomach is boiling, I come to dry heaving, the effort sends me back into the oblivion of sleep. 

I don’t know how long has passed, my face feels like it is on fire, and the thick steel bars of my cell door are closed. 

It takes me two minutes of cupping my hands under the grime laden steel tap to get enough water to clear off a spot on the rusted, old, wall mounted steel mirror. 

No mortal hand could have scarred me as accurately as Art did. The wounds, not healed, but cauterised as to not make me bleed out, used depth, and width, to create a colorless replica of my makeup. 

I know trauma, physical as well as mental, and these are scars that will never heal. As the fact sinks in that my face is literally no longer my own, I scream, heart pounding, I split open my knees on the cold cement floor. 

Pain flares, threatens to send me back to the bliss of unconsciousness, but I don’t care. 

I read Kev’s journals, and they paint me in a really… positive light, in a sense. 

What I mean is, going by what he thought he saw, I’m some kind of supervillian or something. Tossing three hundred pound air conditioners ( it was the outer shell, seventy pounds, physics and luck did the rest.), wrestling Art ( I was clinging on for dear life, had it not been for Jr and the mass of denizens, I’d have been killed with a flick of his wrist.), or appearing like a ghost (people, even immortal are very unobservant. Especially in an emergency.). 

I’m great at seeming horrifying, and that’s a weapon in and of itself, but at the end of the day, that’s all it is. 

Kneeling in my own blood, vision blurry with pain, I realise how small, vulnerable, and unarmed I truly am. 



By the time daylight shines through the yellow reinforced glass window, I’m already awake. I’ve spent an hour and a half calming myself, trying to find some focus, some centre to keep me going. 

I’ve been in prison before, back home, first and last time I tried plying my trade outside of America. 

Being the stupid payaso gringo that I am I bit off so much more than I can chew that I wound up choking on it for 2 months in a Mexican prison.  

The routine of, count, lineup, chow, remained the same. 

The demographics of the population on the other hand… 

Being observant is one of my main skills and as I was brought into the absurdly sized cafeteria, I was taken aback at just how many people were here. 

Tens of Thousands, easily, maybe a hundred. I try and think of how many missing person cases this accounts for, and even that math doesn’t quite add up. 

I quickly inventory the groups that make up the place, not that it wasn’t obvious. 

The first, of course are the guards. Some, the majority, appear to be human, well geared up and in intimidating physical condition. 

But a handful, they are clearly, something else. Some are smooth featured ebony skinned giants, carrying truncheons that could crush a car engine. Others are grinning, pale skinned bad attempts at human copies, wild eyed and twitching. 

Second would be what I called the cultists. They all appeared to style themselves after certain tropes and urban legends, clearly human, but dressing, tattooing and mutilating themselves to appear like, myths, legends, and monsters. 

The subtle violence I see tells me I’ve found the gangs. 

Third are the Everymen, I can’t see any kind of pattern to them, but they seem to make up the majority of the population. They keep their distance from the guards and the cultists, but on more than one occasion I see then stand, united against attempts at extortion. 

The last group, I call the candles, people that are clearly on their way out mentally and physically. Sunken eyed, and set upon from all angles, at any moment these folks could be simply snuffed out. 

I keep my distance, and stay respectful, the meandering, twisting line seems to take hours to get me my thick slice of crumbling yellow bread, and thick red slurry that reminds me of porridge masquerading as meat. 

My coat is gone but I’m left with the majority of the clothing I fashioned back in the path. I see a mix of unwashed orange uniforms and ‘civilian’ clothing, some of the cultists, bordering more on costume than wardrobe. 

As the massive, butchers apron wearing man in smeared clown makeup sits down, I wish I’d have been issued something more generic. I saw this coming the second I noticed a lump of Chlorophiles in blood stained getups. 

“You sit with us. “ I can’t tell if it’s an accent or speech pattern, the clown sounds strange, either way. 

I eat a spoonful of the red sludge. 

“No disrespect intended, I’m not one for clubs. I’m going to make no waves, no plays, nothing. I’m a ghost. “ I say, levelly, avoiding eye contact. 

Why, you might ask, having been told about my adventures in murder. 

Well, that’s just it. Murder is easy, and any time you saw me end a life, it was just that. 

A fight, that’s another thing entirely, especially against someone with a significant weight and height advantage. 

“Not asking. You got friends. “ The massive clown moves his bulk closer, it’s like sitting next to a forklift. 

I eat the bread, it tastes amazing until I swallow, then has a foul, chemical aftertaste. 

I drink some tepid, burgundy fluid that might be caffeinated. 

No weapons nearby, no one watching that might step in. I’m full of bruises and sprains, and probably anemic from blood loss. Not to mention one eye is running at about fifty per cent. Art didn’t sever the optic nerve last time, but he wasn’t gentle.  My heart races. 

“I don’t play well with people who take clowning and slap a coat of dark paint on it. 

You guys are Clown Killers. You are good at killing, I’m sure, but the clown part, it’s tacked on. 

Myself, I’m a killer clown…. “ I had a really good rant planned, honestly, it was a corker, douche bags would have used it in memes for a decade. 

But before I can react, with one massive hand, he bounces my face off of the pitted steel table. 

It rings my bell, but not as much as I let on. In clowning terms, what I do Is called a pratfall. 

For those of you that don’t speak nerd, I oversell the hit, falling backwards, eyes fluttering. 

I tip backwards, reaching out my left arm, as if to steady myself. The meat mountain is unbothered, knowing I have no chance unarmed, in this close, he let’s me grab one shoulder of the butchers apron. The material is thick, and matted in stains that will never come out, literally or metaphorically. 

If you want to take someone out, in a relatively harmless way, you don’t want to choke  them. It takes forever, usually ends up killing them, and generally is a bad idea for everyone involved. 

Your goal is go cut off blood flow to the brain as quickly and fully as possible. 

I hook my thumb around the opposite shoulder strap, and snap my body backward, the apron acting as an impromptu Garrotte. 

His right arm is knotted through my left, as he tries to struggle, to put his murderous intent and ability to work, the choke only becomes tighter. 

I don’t want enemies here, and I only have so many tricks to play before things come to a knock down drag out fight, so I leave the clown unharmed. 

I do need friends, but the look I get as I take a seat at a loose collection of men is cold and fearful. 

A red haired guy, five foot nine or so, makes eye contact, “Anything we can help you with? “ he says, fearless. 

“Yeah, despite the face work I’ve had done, I have fuck all in common with any of those penny wise, Icp, Gacy dressed, assholes. 

I need a tribe guys, you all look like the unlucky ones around here, but I don’t want to get involved in bloodshed. 

I’m Mike “ I know, that’s only mostly true, but I mean it, either way. I extend a hand. 

“Chris. “ the red haired guy says, he wears a white dress shirt and surprisingly blue jeans, “Those stains around your cuffs tell me otherwise. 

If you’re telling the truth, that’s great. If you are lying, and still sane enough to keep your word, that’s even better. “ Chris’s tone is mirthless, I read him easily. He’s been here a long time for a short life, he looks thirty max, and I shudder to think how young he may have been when he came in. 

Chris catches me up on the ins and outs of this place, beyond what a general knowledge of prison would give. 

Everyone here has crimes they were not convicted of, that would, otherwise put them in jail for life. A large amount, obviously are murderers, torturers, real bastards. 

But a significant minority are just regular folks, maybe a bit thoughtless, but that have collected a litany of small, petty, in cases almost victim less crimes. 

No one seems to be aware of the… reality t.v. Meets demonic fast food aspect of things, but there is a Doom cherry on this fear Sunday. 

There is a single way someone can get out. To earn 20 tokens. 

And how does one earn these tokens you ask? 

Each day the prison holds an event, to call it a challenge would insinuate a level of fair play that is simply not there. The events range from somewhat fair, a fight or game of chance, to esoteric rituals complex enough to rip someone’s soul from their body. 

These tokens are also the sole form of currency in the prison, they can buy everything from commissary snacks to literal free passes from guards. 

The economy has created a cut throat society, the heads of the cults not even taking advantage of being able to be free, but simply reveling in the power of being psychotic and enabled. 

The weak are enslaved, their lives traded on the off chance at tokens. 

So, of course, braindead asshole that I am, I signed myself right up. Feeling a little more confidant after climbing Mount Bozo. 

It's 8pm and the volunteers are rounded up and brought to a massive room that has all the trappings of a gymnasium, but the scale is large enough easily hold the focus of tonight’s events. 

In tiered bleachers all around us, our fellow prisoners cheer and scream. The smell of thousands of unwashed, men is overpowering, the din of excitement is deafening. 

But my attention is focussed on the small, single floor home, sitting out of place in the middle of the polished wood floor. 

What I wouldn’t give for Demi to appear right now, give me the low down on all the supernatural bullshit that is heading my way. But the longer we stayed in the mountain the less and less the most useful voice in my head could, or would, make an appearance. 


I study each of my fellow volunteers, the goal seems simple, last the longest in the home. Men enter and leave within minutes. They come out looking shaken, with minor lacerations, and a general sense of shell shock. 

By the time my turn arrives, I think I know what I’m in for. 

I’m wrong. 

As the baby blue door closes behind me, nothing immediately in the home causes me concern. The fixtures and furniture is a bit out of date, the lighting is, not inviting, and there is a general fog of gloom hanging around. 

I smile, I’ve felt this before. Granted I had Demi feeding me supernatural errata at the time, but, I’m positive I can wing it. 

“So, I think I may have met one of you guys before. Back in New York, a Happy-Face corner store, anyone you know? 

Scary dude, took a couple of pieces out of me. 

But this, it’s more like an MMA fight, right? I tap out when you start kicking my ass? “ I stretch, trying to see if I’m getting any kind of reaction. 

I inventory the objects around me, last time everything that wasn’t nailed down, shifted, changed and tried to take me apart.

You may have noticed by now, I love using the phrase ‘ last time’, and that’s because up until this moment, I haven’t learned a fucking thing here. 

Mike’s first rule of paranormal survival, last time means nothing. 

“It’s you” the voice is young, late teens, and male. 

I spin, expecting violence, then, wishing violence. 

I know the young man, not this pale, older, revenant with a self inflicted gunshot wound, but I know him none the less. 

I’m not being metaphorical when I say my heart misses a beat, I almost fall over, pounding at my chest to stop it’s arythmatic pounding. 

I knew what happened to him, found it out long after I could do anything about it. And wasn’t in the best of places when I did. 

I’ll call him a ghost for simplicity sake, but this kid, he’s my first, and biggest mistake. 

I based who I turned into on finding what I thought was one of the worst people on earth. This kid’s father. 

I did things to him worthy of what I knew he did. And to top it all off, I had him die by his wife’s hand. 

Well, a decade later I find out, the guy wasn’t a Saint, but he didn’t do anything worthy of the twisted shit I put him through. 

I got wind of some false information put out there in a moment of rage by a tech savvy ten year old. The kid never intended it to see the light of day

“I found out about you Mike, I saw that you were a hero. “ The voice is thin echoes like a stuck record. 

“No kid, don’t think that. “ I mumble, I’m shaking, the air is freezing, each breath comes out as white mist. 

I’m sitting on the flower printed couch now, and it hits me. 

I’d assumed because Art couldn’t screw around in my head last time, the same went for everything here. 

Remember what we said about last time. 

“My told me what happened one night, what I made you do. 

I destroyed her memory of him, I made a real Hero kill him, I couldn’t keep hurting people. “ I can see images, flashing in my mind, memories that are not mine. 

I’m counting seconds, trying to focus, trying to stay long enough to get the token. It has to have been fifteen, twenty minutes at least. 

I try to work up a smirk, to convince myself that I’m just being played by the paranormal equivalent of a heckler. 

That’s not it though, This place, this house, is reaching inside me and finding places to look. As I stare into the young man’s rotted eyes I know this is some part of him, torn away from whatever rest he was entitled to. 

The lights dim, then turn off. The house is silent. 

Hollywood gets being both a lunatic and a hitman wrong in equal measure. No matter how much morality you want to inject into the profession, there are going to come times when you make mistakes. 

As the lights slowly turn to a dull orange glow, I’m surrounded by the hovering, mutilated forms of mine. 

Those that died that could have been spared, those that died because of my inaction, or stupidity. I’ve never forgotten them, I use them to make sure I never make the same mistakes again, but having them looming, screaming, all demanding I hear their stories, their accusations, their placations. 

It's too much, I stumble from the couch, trying to avoid the icy touch of these phantoms. For a moment I find some last scrap of courage, I close my eyes, shut out the shrieking din of the dead. 

The silence hits like a truck, I focus, trying to calm my burned out nerves. 

Then they are reignited like a fucking welding torch. 

“This place didn’t bring us here. 

We’ve been right next to you for years Mike. We can’t leave. “ The voice of my first mistake. 

Like a toddler I try to run with my eyes closed, I trip over a glass coffee table, clawing my way up the door, grasping at the handle. 

I can feel a slight pull now, almost magnetic, trying to drag me backwards. 

My hands shake too much, I have to steady my right wrist with my left hand, the floor becomes slick, I see the door, escape start to move further away as I’m pulled backward. 

I've taken a hit or two, and had a couple of three day benders that have made me piss myself. But as I stumble, trying to make progress on the nearly friction less floor, I have another unpleasant first experience. 

I grab the handle, pulling myself out of the house, launching my body into a skin peeling tumble across unforgiving plank flooring. 

I’m a shaking, fetal wreck, by the time I’ve pulled myself together enough to take in my surroundings, I see the red Led clock displaying my time. 

42 seconds. Bottom of the barrel. The jeers and booing from the crowd do nothing for my frayed nerves or the storm of fear and anxiety going through my mind. 


I’m exhausted, but I can’t sleep, it has nothing to do with the concrete slab that serves as my bed. 

My stomach has been knotting and cramping, with each passing second I get more worried I blew some internal gasket in one of the many life or death struggles in the past months. 

When I finally manage to vomit, the urge is strong enough I get no where near the filth crusted hole in the floor that serves as my toilet. And my worst fears are confirmed as I see the massive pile of vomit is mostly blood. 

… and bones? Is that an eyeball? A piece of fur? 

The mass begins to pull itself together, bits and pieces forming the most rudimentary attempt at a face. 

“Junior? “ I say, stunned.
