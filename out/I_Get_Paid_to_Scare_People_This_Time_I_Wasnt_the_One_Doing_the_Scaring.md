People pay me to scare them.

Not in a fun, haunted house kind of way. My job is more…personal. Tailored. I find what gets under your skin and make it real, at least for a little while. Some people get a rush from it, others just want to feel something.

I have rules, though. I never touch anyone. I never actually break anything. And I never—ever—take a job unless I know every detail first.

So when I got a job offer from an anonymous client willing to pay double my usual rate, I should’ve known something was off.

“Make him believe the house is haunted,” the client said. “Make him believe something’s inside with him.”

Easy enough. I’d done it a hundred times before.

The house was an old Victorian on the edge of town, isolated, surrounded by overgrown trees that swallowed the streetlights. The kind of place that already felt haunted. The client’s brother had moved in a week prior. No family, no visitors, just him alone in a big house.

Perfect target.

I arrived at midnight. No car in the driveway. No lights on. I picked the lock easily; this wasn’t breaking and entering, not really. I was invited.

The second I stepped inside, I knew something was wrong.

The air was thick, wrong, like the pressure before a thunderstorm. It smelled faintly sweet, like rotting fruit and something else..something wet and metallic.

I brushed it off and got to work.

I started with small things. Shifted furniture just slightly. Left doors half-open. Whispered through the vents just enough to make the air hum. Simple tricks, things that get into your head and make you question what you know you did.

Then I heard it.

A shuffle of movement from upstairs.

I froze. The client said his brother would be home, but I hadn’t seen any sign of him. No shoes by the door, no dishes in the sink. The house felt empty.

Then came the footsteps. Slow. Deliberate.

Coming down the stairs.

I held my breath and pressed myself into the shadows. I’ve been caught before, but I know how to hide. My eyes adjusted, and that’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t a man. Not anymore.

A thing stood at the top of the stairs. A twisted, grotesque version of a human, its body unnaturally long and skeletal. Its skin was translucent, stretched tight over elongated limbs, veins pulsing beneath like they were about to burst. It had the twisted frame of a human but spindly legs. Legs like an insect’s, ending in sharp, twitching talons that scraped against the wooden floor. Its body was covered in a fine, oily, black fur that glistened in the dim light.

Its face…

Its face was where the nightmare began.

A massive, bulbous head with too many eyes—glassy and black; flickered all over its skin. They weren’t arranged neatly like a spider’s, they were scattered in irregular patterns, one near its jaw, another on its forehead, some just under its chin, blinking in a maddening, unpredictable rhythm.

The thing’s mouth…No, it wasn’t a mouth. It was a horrific, churning mass of jagged, needle-like teeth, all constantly moving as if they were fighting to break free from its face. It opened impossibly wide, its jaw unhinging like a snake’s, stretching down to its chest.

Then I saw its hands.

Its hands were wrong in a way that made my stomach twist. They weren’t hands at all. They were spider legs; long, segmented, and twitching. They were like thick, black antennae that twitched with violent energy, bending and unfurling as they scraped against the wall.

I could feel the heat in my throat rise. I should’ve turned and run. I should’ve done anything but stay frozen.

But the thing wasn’t finished. It tilted its head. The sound of its neck cracking echoed through the house like dry twigs snapping underfoot.

Then, it spoke.

Its voice wasn’t human. It sounded like a distorted, garbled hiss mixed with a sharp, skittering click; like the sound of a thousand bugs crawling in the dark.

“You…shouldn’t…have…come…”

Before I could even process the words, the thing lunged. But not with speed. It moved in jerks like it was still learning how to control its body. Its legs clicked and bent with disturbing precision, the long, sharp appendages scraping against the floor with every movement.

My body moved before my brain could catch up. I ran. I bolted toward the door, and the sound of it pursuing..scratching, scraping, skittering; was deafening. Every part of me screamed to get out, to survive.

Then, just as my hand gripped the door handle

The lights went out.

The house went black.

I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe. My heart thundered in my ears as I fumbled in the dark. And that’s when I felt it; ice-cold legs, crawling across my back, their jagged tips scraping my skin like they were testing the flesh.

I wrenched open the door and tore through the hallway, not looking back. I don’t know how I got to the car, my hands so slick with sweat I could hardly grip the wheel. But I know one thing.

As I pulled out of the driveway, I looked in the rearview mirror.

That thing was standing at the top of the stairs, its eyes flashing in the window. It tilted its head and, with one last horrifying click, smiled.

I left town that same night, the cold fear still crawling under my skin. I haven’t stopped driving. I haven’t looked back.

And I swear; I will never, ever scare anyone again.
