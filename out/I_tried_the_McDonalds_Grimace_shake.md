The day was June 12th. It was your average rainy day. I was watching YouTube when i got an ad showing the new Grimace meal for the birthday of the McDonald's mascot. The main selling point being the new milkshake: The grimace shake. This shake was purple with whipped cream on top. Since it was so new I haven't heard anything about it. I was already super bored so I decided that I should go to McDonald's and order this because the shake did look pretty tasty. this would be the biggest and last mistake of my life. I got up from the couch, got my keys and left the house late at night at around 10:30.

I got in my car and drived to McDonald's which was about 10-15 minutes away. The road was straight ahead and was surrounded by trees. It was a normal and quite relaxing night drive until I saw something in the corner of my eye. What I saw was a body in the woods shirtless with his upper body covered in purple. He also had some dirt on him. On the ground next to him was McDonald's drink cup for grimaces birthday. The shake was leaking out of his mouth as well. A wave of dread washed over me and my blood ran cold. I tried to convince my self that since it was dark I was seeing things. 

I kept driving still quite disturbed and reached McDonald's and went in the drive through. Turns out you can't order the shake by itself and have to order the meal. I ordered the 10 nuggets meal with the shake. I drived home and as I was driving I took a sip of the shake. This is when it went blurry.

 After I took a sip I woke up in my car upside down in the woods. I wasnt sure how long I was out. My body was half outside the broken window and I was covered in the grimace shake and some blood. There was glass everywhere and I was in lots of pain. My vision was a little blurry. I was drooling but it wasn't just saliva It was the Berry tasting grimace shake. I could barely move making it hard to crawl out the car. As I was crawling I could make out the same body I saw while driving. The same feelings came back and I felt like throwing up. As I was about to crawl out the vehicle I saw the body being dragged. I didn't see who did it but all I saw was a furry purple arm dragging it. I froze completely and after a few seconds I snapped back into it and decided to crawl out while the guy who dragged the body was gone. 

Now I'm hiding behind a tree covered in the grimace shake and it won't stop coming out my mouth. I'm trying to be silent and escape but I can barely move. It took all of my energy to get behind this tree. I hear footsteps behind the tree. I wanted to write this as a goodbye message. And I have one more thing to say: 

DO NOT TRY THE GRIMACE SHAKE.
