I moved into that apartment in the summer of 2003.  
It was a quiet building on the edge of town — six units, a cracked parking lot, and a small patch of grass out front that the landlord swore he’d “turn into a garden someday.”

The rent was cheap, and I’d just gotten my first steady job at a hardware store, so I didn’t care that the walls were thin or that the ceiling creaked when someone walked above me. It was mine. My first place alone.

The first week, I barely noticed the man upstairs. Sometimes I’d hear the faint thump of footsteps around midnight, or the sound of a TV playing static too loud. I figured he worked late. Everyone in the building seemed quiet, the kind of small-town people who don’t ask questions.

Then, around the third week, I started waking up at 3 a.m. sharp. Every night.

It wasn’t a nightmare that woke me, or any loud noise. It was the silence.  
That strange, heavy kind of silence that makes you aware of your own heartbeat. Then I’d hear it — a slow, dragging sound from the ceiling. Like someone moving furniture an inch at a time.

At first, I tried to ignore it. I’d turn over, tell myself the guy was just rearranging his place. But after a few nights, it got weird.

The sound didn’t move normally. It would stop right above my bed, stay still for minutes, then shift to the corner of the room. Once, I heard something like… humming. Not a song — more like someone whispering to themselves without words.

When I told my landlord, he shrugged.  
“Oh, that’s probably Mr. Clark,” he said. “He’s been there for years. Retired fella. Keeps to himself.”

So I left it at that.

But a few days later, I ran into the lady from 2B while checking my mail. She was in her sixties, always wearing pink slippers. I asked her if she knew Mr. Clark.

She frowned.  
“Sweetheart, nobody’s lived in 3A since last winter. That apartment’s empty.”

I laughed awkwardly, thinking she must be mistaken.  
But that night, when I looked up toward the window above mine, there was a faint light on — flickering blue, like a TV.

I told myself maybe she just didn’t notice someone moved in. The landlord wasn’t exactly the type to update tenants about anything.

Still, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

So one evening, I waited until I heard the footsteps. Then I went outside and looked up.  
The window was dark. No TV light.  
But I could still hear the slow creaking of floorboards.

That’s when I noticed something else.  
The sound wasn’t *above* me anymore. It was *inside* my apartment.

It lasted maybe two seconds — long enough for me to freeze in place, too afraid to breathe. Then it was gone.

After that, things started changing subtly. My clock radio would reset to 3:00 every night. My bathroom mirror fogged up even when the shower hadn’t run.  
And sometimes, when I walked into my bedroom, it smelled faintly of old cigarettes — the kind my grandfather used to smoke.

I started leaving the TV on for background noise. It helped for a while. Then one night, I woke up and the TV had turned itself off.

Static hissed from the screen for a moment, and then — faintly — I heard it again.  
That low, wordless humming.

I called the landlord the next morning.  
He said he’d check the apartment upstairs, but two days later he called back and told me the door was still locked and covered in dust. Nobody had been inside.

I almost moved out then. But I was stubborn, broke, and tired of running from “weird feelings.” So I decided to prove to myself that there was a normal explanation.

I borrowed a cheap tape recorder from the hardware store and left it on my nightstand before I went to bed.  
At 3 a.m., I woke up like clockwork — no sound, no movement, just that oppressive stillness.  
The next morning, I played the tape.

Nothing for the first few minutes. Then, faintly, I heard it.  
Humming.  
And underneath it, something that made my stomach drop — my own voice, whispering words I couldn’t make out.

I threw the recorder away.

Weeks passed. I stopped sleeping much. My coworkers noticed I was off — pale, jumpy, distracted. I told them I had insomnia.

Then one night, I came home from a late shift and saw the light on upstairs again.  
I couldn’t help it — I grabbed my flashlight and climbed the back stairs to 3A.

The door was unlocked.

Inside, everything was coated in dust. A few pieces of furniture draped in yellowed sheets.  
The air smelled stale, like mothballs and old wood.  
I was about to leave when I saw something carved into the wall near the window — deep scratches forming words:

>

My flashlight flickered.  
And then — clear as day — I heard footsteps behind me, slow and deliberate.

I turned around, but no one was there.  
Just the sound of breathing that wasn’t mine.

I bolted down the stairs and didn’t stop running until I was back in my car. I slept at a motel that night.

When I returned the next day, the landlord was standing outside. He looked uneasy.  
“Saw your car gone all night,” he said. “Listen, if you’re hearing things, maybe you should know… Mr. Clark died in that apartment last year. Heart attack. They didn’t find him for three days.”

I didn’t ask any more questions. I just nodded and went back inside my own place.

That night, I didn’t hear any footsteps. No humming. Nothing.

For the first time in weeks, I slept straight through until morning.

The strange part is, things felt *better* after that.  
My headaches stopped. The air in the apartment felt lighter, cleaner.

But every once in a while — when I’m half-asleep — I still hear faint humming through the wall.  
It doesn’t scare me anymore.

In a weird way, it’s comforting. Like he’s still there, keeping me company.  
Sometimes I even hum back.

I know how that sounds — crazy, right? But after living alone for so long, I’ve learned that sometimes the quietest places aren’t really empty.

Sometimes, the things we hear in the dark aren’t trying to hurt us.  
They just don’t want to be forgotten.

And neither do I.

*I’ve kept that apartment ever since. The rent never went up, and no one’s asked to see 3A.*  
*If you drive by on a rainy night, you might notice one window glowing faint blue from an old TV.*  
*Don’t worry about it. He’s fine up there.*  
*And so am I.*
