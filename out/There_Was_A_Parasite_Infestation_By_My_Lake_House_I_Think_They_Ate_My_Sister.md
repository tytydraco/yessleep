*“...The vicious Gillman lumbered towards the frightened young blonde, her luscious figure trembling in fear as the scaly demon walked towards her, arms stretched out in horrid delight and wanting. The Gillman made a low groaning sound, like a car blowing out it’s engine in the dead of night, and raised his smelly, scaly claw, raised it high above her head and-”*

“Did you really just use the word luscious?” I heard my sister say from behind me. I jumped up slightly and looked at her giving her my best scowl. 

“And are YOU really reading over my shoulder, you know how much I hate that, Abby.” I replied. I closed the tab that held my newest writing piece on it; “*The Gillman Of Alcatraz*” and got up from my seat.

“I’m just saying, are you writing a horror story or are you writing a fish monster porno?” She giggled, giving me a poke. Abby was staying with me after her piece of shit Ex kicked her out. He got the house in the divorce, but she got the dog. We were both staying at our parent’s old lake house in Meredith. They only lived here in the fall now, as taking up residence in Florida had all but become a full-time job. I often stayed here during the summer; it helps me with the writing process. But with Abby here, it had become rather tedious with her constant barging in on my work.

“Well, who says horror can’t be horror AND erotic.” I replied, practically dragging her out of my office. “Why don’t you go swimming or sunbathing or SOMETHING that isn’t in the way of my work.”

“Fine, Fine, I just came to tell you I was taking the boat out anyway, thought you might want to hang out but S-o-o-rry. I’ll just let you get back to your luscious fishman.” With that she turned and left, her bright red hair sparkling in the midday sun. I sighed and went back to my office, but of course I had lost my train of thought. Disheartened, I went to the back porch. The auburn wood was worn out yet well cared for. The porch overlooked Lake Winnipesaukee, in all its summer glory. I could hear cicadas droning on in the distance, as the water sparkled and slowly churned into mini waves weakly hitting the shore. It was damn beautiful this time of year. Not a cloud in the sky, I could see the glorious mountains in the distance.

I looked down and saw Abby walking in her pink two pieces down the metal dock towards the boat. The boat was the other thing she got in the divorce, a beautiful Boston Whaler. It was her pride and joy. She walked onto the boat after washing her feet in the water and looked up and saw me looking at her. She gave me a little wave and a smile, and I waved her back. I love my sister, but she makes it hard to focus on my work. I’m an amateur horror writer for some obscure gothic website, though not obscure enough that I don’t get paid….  100$ a story. And I write about two a week if I’m lucky sooo...you do the math. There is a reason I’m staying at my parent’s house.

Abby started the boat, and I could hear that brand spanking new engine roar. She soared out of the port like a bat outta hell. The water churned and bubbled as she sped down the lake. The water fizzled out and calmed and I looked at it. It was very dirty, murky and full of great clouds of moss. I frowned at this; the water was never like this. I walked down to the beach on the freshly painted brown stairs. The smell of overdone brown paint assaulted my nostrils, but as I approached the dock, a new smell hit me. One of rotten fish and dry moss. I covered my face in disgust and walked to the end of the pier, the smell intensifying in the summer heat. I looked down into the musty water, only to see a giant cloud of moss and algae covering the bottom floor. Not an inch was left uncovered, no sand, no rocks, not even fish. There were only the algae. My vision could only get me so far, not that the water was helping matters. After staring at it for a few moments I could see packs of little white dots floating around in the moss. No...not floating. Swimming. The dot packs were tiny, but dozens of them were connected by a thick white string. There had to be hundreds, if not thousands of the tiny little buggers swimming around. I figured they had to be some kind of bug, or a parasite, like one of those tiny worms that live in the Amazon that swim up a man’s urine stream. Or was that a fish? It doesn't matter, the point remained that there were dozens of these things, and the smell, the horrible decaying smell, was getting worse.

I could see a dark shape bubbling up in the water, and suddenly that smell made sense. A large cod popped up to the surface, covered in a pack of those dot creatures. The fish was being dissolved, eaten I should say, by the things. I could see the once bright red scales peeling off to reveal sticky fleshy meat slowly pulling off into the deep. The fish’s dead eye bobbled in the water staring up at me. I know it is impossible to tell, but I swear the poor thing was still alive as these little aquatic monsters were devouring it inside and out. And they were inside, as in that same eye I soon saw a little white dot appear in the black of its eye. It slowly pressed through the iris of the eye, and I backed away, slipping like a fool on the pail that Abby used to clean her damn feet. I hit the side of the metal pool hard, my ears ringing and I could feel the lump forming in the back of my head. I could also feel my right arm getting wet. My eyes widened. I quickly pulled my arm out of the mossy brink. I looked at my hand and sure enough, there were several of the dot creatures on there. At first they did not move, but then after what felt like an eternity, they started wiggling around on my arm, feeling like acid being poured on my skin. I pulled them off as quickly as I could, as they tried to burrow their way under my skin, into my veins. My legs started to burn and I looked down, as the pail filled with lake water had spilled onto the dock, and those dot creatures it held within had moved towards the warm flesh they must have sensed. I scrambled to get up and almost slipped into the rotting water, and ran towards the stairs, towards salvation from these things.

I limped towards the first step and swatted at my legs, the burning pain still lingering, the things in my arm still wriggling. As soon as I was sure my legs were clean of their filth, I went back to my arm.  Only one dot worm remained, and it was just about in me completely. It struggled to get into my bloodstream, to infect me with whatever acidic bullshit these things used to eat. I pulled the little bastard out and flung it back into the lake. I ran up the stairs like a gazelle being chased by a lion, the bottom of my feet still burning. I ran into the house, slamming the glass sliding door behind me, damn near breaking it. I rushed to the sink, turning on the hot water to wash off my aching arm. I looked at it as the warming water washed away whatever the hell was in the lake, and I could see the damage the dot worms had done. They had left trials of acidic spit and drool on my arm, scaring it straight away. There were several bloody holes where they tried to tunnel into me. That’s when it hit me. Abby was still out on the boat, if she decided to take a swim...*If she had WASHED HER FEET.* I picked up my phone and called her.

“*Hey-HEY you- you I don’t like your boyfriend-”* 

Damn. The phone was upstairs. Seeing no other choice, I called 9-1-1. They patched me through to the sheriff; I told him what had happened. I could hear silence on the other end, and I thought for sure he thought I was crazy, and then…

“.... We’ve been getting calls about this all day, if she’s still on the boat she might be fine, but the CDC boys ain't too sure. I’ll send a patrol out for her as soon as the damn moss clears up.”

I could hear the dread in his voice. Whatever was in the lake was everywhere else, not just my port. I know for a fact; there's a summer camp open just a mile away from me…

I stayed in my house for the next few hours with the radio on. The CDC had shown up within the first few calls, almost too quickly if you ask me, but then I’m sure we’ll never hear the real story behind the dot worms. At least I won’t. Their spokesperson came on and said that a rare flesh-eating bacterium had invaded the lake, and that in the worst case there would be “mild bruising and swelling” but to stay indoors no matter what.  I could hear them spraying something outside. When they finally gave the all clear, I headed to the sheriff’s office. When I got there he took me aside, and with a sad expression on his face, yet with a hint of bewilderment, he told me what he found when he sent the boat out for Abby.

“Well...she’s gone, I’m sorry. I went out with Stevens on the boat, we got about a mile and a half in and we found the boat, floating all idle like ...I should say, we didn’t find a body but ...well I’m sure one of them CDC boys will tell you differently, or hell just get you to sign something...but ...I shined a light on the boat. It was covered in blood, and in the driver’s, seat was a pile of shredded clothes, and those worm things...I don’t know what happened to Abby. But I do know she’s gone."

The Sheriff was right, the CDC did try and get me to sign something. I'm sure in my blank state I did. The next few weeks were a blur of tears and blame. My parents never got over her disappearance and stayed in Florida. I became a recluse in that house, turning to the comfort of a bottle to ache the pain.

The lake never recovered, 80% of all life in it had simply vanished. A dreary end to this story, but I suppose that is life. In my drunkest moments, sometimes I stare at an old pickle jar tucked away on my mantle. it's full of murky water and emits a smell of rot.

I can hear them sometimes; they talk in my sister's voice. They say if I feed them, I can see her again.

It's probably drunken delusions.

But what do I have to lose.
