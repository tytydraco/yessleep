I moved into my new apartment with a mix of excitement and nervousness. Being a college sophomore, this was my first time living alone in the city. The apartment itself seemed cozy enough, situated in an old building with creaky wooden floors and a vintage charm. Little did I know that this place held secrets far more terrifying than I could have ever imagined.

The first night in my new apartment started innocently enough. As I lay in bed, the silence of the city enveloped me. But as I was about to drift off to sleep, a faint scratching sound echoed from the walls. At first, I dismissed it as the noise of an old building settling. However, the scratching persisted, growing louder and more persistent with each passing night.

Soon, I started noticing strange occurrences. Objects would go missing only to reappear in completely different places. I would find my belongings rearranged, as if someone had invaded my personal space. The unease settled deep within me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

One night, as the scratching grew louder than ever, I mustered the courage to investigate. Armed with only a flashlight, I ventured into the darkness of the apartment. The light danced across the walls, revealing nothing out of the ordinary. But as I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure out of the corner of my eye.

My heart pounded in my chest as I followed the figure down a narrow corridor. The apartment seemed to stretch on infinitely, the walls closing in around me. The scratching sound filled the air, growing more frenzied with each step. Panic consumed me, but I couldn't turn back.

Finally, the figure vanished into a room at the end of the corridor, and I hesitantly followed. As I entered, my flashlight flickered, casting eerie shadows across the walls. It was a small, cramped space filled with dusty old furniture and decaying photographs. But what caught my attention was the mirror hanging on the wall.

I approached the mirror cautiously, and as I stared into it, my reflection didn't match my movements. It was as if someone else was controlling my reflection, mimicking my every action. The scratching sound reached a deafening crescendo, and the mirror shattered into a thousand shards. I screamed in terror as the room plunged into darkness.

Suddenly, a cold wind swept through the apartment, extinguishing every light source. The scratching sound turned into a guttural growl, echoing through the darkness. I felt a presence moving closer, its icy breath grazing the back of my neck. In that moment, I knew I was not alone.

Terrified, I fought against the darkness, stumbling blindly through the apartment. The scratching followed me, closing in on me from all directions. I could feel a malevolent force surrounding me, suffocating me with its evil presence. Panic consumed my every thought as I desperately searched for an escape.

Finally, I reached the front door, throwing it open and fleeing into the cold night. The apartment building loomed behind me, its windows dark and foreboding. I never looked back, too afraid of what I might see. The experience had left me scarred, forever haunted by the chilling events that occurred within those walls.

To this day, I warn others about that apartment, urging them to steer clear of the darkness that lurks within. It taught me that even the most ordinary places can hold unimaginable horrors. No longer a skeptic, I share my story with anyone who will listen, hoping to save them from the same terrifying fate.

Months passed after my escape from that accursed apartment, yet the memories refused to fade. Sleep eluded me, and whenever I closed my eyes, I would see the broken mirror and hear the relentless scratching sound. The fear had etched itself into the very core of my being, leaving me perpetually on edge.

One evening, as I walked through the city streets, trying to distract myself from the nightmares that plagued me, I noticed a familiar face in a crowd. It was a young woman, her eyes filled with a mixture of curiosity and unease as she glanced in my direction. Something about her struck a chord deep within me, and without thinking, I approached her.

"Excuse me," I said, my voice trembling slightly. "I couldn't help but notice you. Have we met before?"
