I don’t expect anyone to believe me.

Hell, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe it either. But I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. And I can’t sleep—not anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I’m back in that warehouse, holding that phone. Watching those videos. Waiting for that moment where everything stops making sense.

I’ve worked port security in Long Beach for going on ten years. Not the kind of security where I walk around with a gun or anything. I sit in an office surrounded by screens, mostly checking manifests, inspecting seals, making sure what’s on paper matches what’s in the container.

It’s tedious. Boring. Sometimes it’s a stolen shipment, sometimes it’s mislabeled electronics. Most of the time, it’s nothing.

This time, it was something.

⸻

The Car That Shouldn’t Have Been There

It started with a manifest glitch. One of the containers offloaded from Valencia showed up with no registered contents. No product code. No consignee. Just a blank line next to the container ID: 28-ALPHA.

We flagged it for inspection.

When the crew cracked it open, I was watching from the control room.

Inside was a black luxury sedan. Parked neatly. Untouched.

The container had been sealed. The pin was intact, the Spanish customs tag unbroken. There was no way anyone had opened it since it left the other port.

We assumed it was misrouted cargo—until Jorge looked inside the car and saw the phone.

The First Video

The phone was almost dead, screen cracked, but it powered on.

No passcode. Just dozens of video files. All selfie-style. All recorded by the same man.

The first log starts with him whispering:

“Okay. I just woke up. I think I’m inside the container. I can’t open the doors.”

He shows the metal walls—pressed tight against both sides of the car. No way out. No light. No signal.

“I must’ve fallen asleep in here. I was tired. Now I’m… locked in?”

He tries the doors. No give. He honks the horn. Nothing. No echo. No outside noise at all.

His tone changes fast—from nervous to terrified. It felt real. Too real.

⸻

The Spiral Begins

The next few videos get worse.

He’s trying everything: flashlight on, banging, screaming. Still no response.

“I think we’ve left port,” he says in one log. “I heard the ship’s horn just before I woke up. No signal. No GPS. This thing’s airtight.”

Later, he starts whispering.

“I heard something. Like… boots. Just outside. Walking.”

Then he says something that gave me chills:

“There’s a shape in the back seat. It’s not there when I turn around. But I feel it.”

He keeps filming the same corner over and over. Most of the time it’s just darkness. But in one frame—just one—I swear it moves.

⸻

Hallucinations or Something Worse

Around hour fifteen, he tries breaking the window. Wraps his shirt around his hand. Hits the glass with a tire iron.

“It cracked,” he says. “I saw daylight. Air. It was cold.”

But the next video…

“It’s gone. The window healed. Like it was never broken.”

His eyes are bloodshot now. He’s mumbling, pacing, laughing at things we can’t see.

“It’s me. In the back seat. I think it’s me. But not me now. Me later.”

His voice warps. The phone glitches. There’s static. One video ends with a still frame of him… and something behind him, out of focus. Long limbs. Featureless face. Sitting exactly where he said the shape was.

⸻

The Final Log

The last regular video starts with Eli in near-darkness.

“If anyone sees this… my name’s Eli Vasquez. I work dock six in Valencia.”

“If this is purgatory, fine. If it’s a dream, wake me up. If it’s real…”

He pauses.

“Check the back seat.”

Then the video cuts.

⸻

But That Wasn’t the Last File

Two days later, something new appeared on the phone. It wasn’t there before. Hidden in a file path that didn’t exist.

It was titled: FINAL.MP4

It starts in total darkness.

Then—a groan of metal hinges.

Light begins flooding in.

The container doors are opening—from inside the car.

You see our crew standing outside. Jorge. Rob. Me. Just like I remember.

We’re opening the container. Finding the car. Finding the phone.

Except this footage is being filmed from the driver’s seat.

Where Eli sat.

Where the phone was found.

But the car is empty.

Which means someone was holding the phone… and filming us.

⸻

And Then It Ended

The file glitches out just as my face appears—looking through the window.

And I remember what I thought in that moment. I wrote it down that same day:

“Why does it feel like someone’s watching me from the inside?”

⸻

We ran Eli’s face through facial recognition. No results. No employment records. No travel manifests. No mention of him in port logs—Valencia or here.

The phone is dead now. Won’t charge. The videos I copied are corrupted. Even the screen recording I saved plays differently every time I watch it.

Sometimes the door doesn’t open.
Sometimes the back seat is empty.
And once… just once… I saw Eli smile.

⸻

I don’t care if you believe me.

But if you ever hear a knock coming from inside a shipping container?

Don’t open it.

Not everything wants to be let out.
