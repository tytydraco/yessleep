'Rude,' I thought as the last person on pushed the elderly lady's bag aside to squeeze on the elevator. He could have waited, but some people can't be bothered to wait 10 seconds for the next one. He mashed the button for the 5th floor, then rapidly pressed the "close door" button. 

'Great, same floor as me.' I rolled my eyes silently. The man then pulled his green scarf roughly off, whipping my face with the ends.

As soon as the door shut, my claustrophobia kicked into high gear. 

"Ding!" Second floor passed.
"Ding!" Two people exited on the third floor.
"Ding!" My hands were shaking as we passed the fourth floor. I held my breath. Then, SCREEEEEAAAAAAK! THUNK!

My brain attempted to undo what was happening. Then, it tried to undo my sanity. I looked down and could see my chest vibrate with my heartbeat. My head felt like it was full of water. As the stars burst before my eyes, I was aware I was fainting. 

' I fucking hate fainting.'

When I came to, there was the smell of strong, musky perfume. 

"There, there, deary. Now you just sit up real slow." said the elderly woman who owned the large bag. She was dressed in a bright red wool skirt suit which matched the bag. I did as she said and looked around. There were five of us cramped in the tiny elevator. 

"How, um, how long was I out?" I managed.

"Oh, just 5 minutes, sweetie. Do you remember going down?" She asked.

"Unfortunately."

"Oh, poor thing." She patted my arm with her thin, papery hands and looked deep into my eyes. For a moment, my head was swimming again and her eyes seemed to shine with excitement. I looked away and shook myself and looked around again. Besides myself, the man with the green scarf, and elderly lady, there were two young men.

"Is everyone else ok?" I asked, looking specifically at the couple. 

"Everyone's fine, love. Now settle down." The lady's grip tensed a bit on my arm, and there was a firmness in her voice that made me uneasy. 

"That's better. Now, everyone have a cookie." She produced some shortbread from the red bag. 

'I'm surprised she doesn't have a whole tea set in there.'

Everyone but "green scarf" took one. 

"Take one." The woman pushed the cookies toward him. He grunted in response. "Alright, sour puss. Maybe you'd prefer a bit of brandy." She produced a single, tiny bottle of unmarked brown liquid. To this, the man said, "Fine." And grabbed it from her hand, quickly consuming the contents. 

The rest of us nibbled the cookies. They were surprisingly good. And made me feel...warm? Relaxed? For moment, I felt like maybe I'd had the brandy. I snuggled into the corner. It felt so...lush. like there were pillows surrounding. I saw the couple giggle and do the same. They cuddled close, one's head on the other’s shoulder.

The lady in red smiled. "That's better." 
In my stupor, I looked over at the other man. 

He did not look cozy. He looked...twitchy. his pupils had dilated, and sweat was beading along his brow. He caught me staring.

"What the fuck are you looking at?"

"Nothing." I turned away. The word had felt like marshmallows in my mouth. 'Has anyone called for help?'

I tried to fumble with my phone. Those papery hands appeared, taking it. I didn't resist.

"Now, don't you worry. Everything is under control." Her words sounded whispy.

Suddenly, the man jumped up and looked around like a trapped animal. 

"YOU PLANNED THIS! YOU'RE ALL...YOU...FUCK!" He grabbed his head pulling at his hair. "I'LL KILL YOU ALL! I'LL TEAR YOU APART!" 

"Will you, dear?" The red lady was now taller, younger, graceful. The bag beside her shifted into...a snake?

'I need to...I need…'

I couldn't form a complete thought. 
The man swung, but she stepped easily aside, a smirk on her lips. She flexed her hands, now smooth with long, red nails. The man swung again.

"So much fear and rage, good, goooood." She hissed. Her python wrapped itself around the man, squeezing until his face was purple. She took one nail, sliced his temple, and began drinking from it. His eyes rolled back. I was unable to move, unable to scream, unable to look away. 

She drank until the man went completely limp, took a tissue out of her pocket, and dabbed her lips.

"Go on now, pet. Your turn." The snake uncoiled and began swallowing the, now dead, man. 

She turned to me.

"I didn't need a whole tea set. Just a bottle of brandy." She winked.

After it had finished, the massive python turned back into the red bag. It even popped up a handle for her to grab. 

"Thank you." She patted the bag.

The elevator door opened, and the woman walked out, pulling her pet behind her.

“Ding!” I jumped. The 5th floor opened to me. I looked over at the couple. We exchanged looks of bewilderment, then exited in silence. 

Always be polite to little old ladies…
