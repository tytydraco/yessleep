Every year, from October through December, a dense fog rolls into town. We call it “Whisper Season”. It fills our shores, minds, and homes with a dread of anticipation. No one knows how it began or where it came from. 

To most, it’s trivial. It comes, it goes. 

Unless you are chosen. Once the sea has called your name, it takes you. The cold will cradle your body, swallowing it, leaving no crumbs. 

It starts with whispers. Swearing that your name is being called from the shadows of the night. Then, paranoia. Louder and louder, until impossible to ignore. 

When it starts, there’s no escape. On the 14th of each December, the whispered one is found. At the edge of the dock, feet in the water. Hands twisted over their ears in angles no human body should allow. 

On the 15th, we hold a memorial. A lone boat takes their body out to sea, and never comes back.

There are no graves, just a cemetery growing a collection of headstones. Empty markers for those the fog has claimed.

I was eight the first time I truly *saw* Whisper Season. 

The fog had already taken my sister Jara the year before. She was nineteen.

We weren’t particularly close, too many years between us, but I loved her. She treated me like a real person, not just a kid.

I remember the morning. Coming down the stairs to find my parents in pieces. My father stared through the window like he was watching her walk away. My mother was holding her boots like they were still warm.

Her footsteps left a clear trail. Out the front door, down the street, straight to the dock.

What broke me was how *normal* she'd been the night before. She laughed at dinner. Said goodnight. Then, while we all slept, she listened to something none of us could hear. The fog had eaten her up and spat her out.

After the memorial, my parents packed up everything she owned and shoved it into storage. No photos. No stories. No tears. Just silence, like she'd never even existed.

I was told not to ask questions. I was too young. I wouldn’t understand. And for a while, I believed that.

But grief doesn’t like being boxed up. And when no one would talk about her: not my parents, not my teachers, not even her friends. Something started to grow in me.

A curiosity, anger, obsession.

Why her?  
Why the fog?  
Why would a whole town treat this like weather?

I needed answers. And no one was giving them.

So I decided I’d find them myself.

I had waited all year. Until the fog crept back up, rolling in and out, like a sleeping lung. 

I stayed quiet and observant. By December, my bones itched with anticipation. This time, I would find out. I would know what the grown-ups couldn’t say. 

The morning of the 14th, I woke in the dark. My alarm blinked 4:27 AM, casting a soft red light across my ceiling. The fog had settled thick that night, pressing against my windows. Something was waiting, breathing.

I moved in silence, avoiding every creak in the floorboard. Dressed in my faded navy blue pajama set, I shivered. It was too light for the cold, but I didn’t dare open my dresser and risk waking up my parents.

I slipped out the front door and into the breath of the fog. The cold bit through my sleeves instantly. I moved like a shadow. 

The docks came into view suddenly, sneaking up on me like a suppressed memory.   
  
The air grew colder. Thicker. Angrier. Like walking through the smoke of a burning house. 

And then. A shape.

He was already there. Imprisoned by the dock.

*Aelen.* 

Sat at the edge, barefoot. Feet submerged in water, arms bent over his ears in a way that turned my stomach. 

My legs locked, and my breath hitched. 

I knew him. He was kind. Warm. 

He was the boy who helped me with my homework. The boy who carried his sister's backpack for six weeks when she broke her arm. And the boy who gave me a wink last week as I struggled to park my bike. 

At first, I thought he might’ve been praying. Until I saw his back. Curved like a question mark, spine twisted. He resembled a puppet with strings pulled too tight. 

Then his arms - God, his arms. 

Bent. Twisted. Wrong.

They folded up and over his ears, like a statue about to collapse. His bones jagged through his skin like broken branches. Fingers curled and clutched at the sides of his skull. 

I stepped closer, and the smell hit me. A culmination of salted rot, like something inside the earth had opened. 

His eyes were open. Dry and wide, staring into the fog like they were one. Aelen and the fog. One of the same. 

My legs gave, vomit spewing out of me. I slowly got back up, still retching.

I wanted to run, scream, to disappear forever. 

But I knew I couldn’t leave him like that. 

I gently whispered his name. 

Nothing. 

Again, a little louder. 

Brief silence. Then his lips began to move. 

No sound came out. Just his mouth shaping words over and over, like he was reciting a prayer underwater. 

I took a deep breath and leaned in. Wrapping my hands with a deathly grip around his sleeves. Then I heard it. 

*My name****.***

Faint. A gurgling. Being spoken through him, not from him. 

I let go, stumbling and running. Not looking back. 

I don’t remember getting home. Just the cold sweat. The sobbing. The images burned into my eyelids. 

That night, I didn’t sleep. 

At the memorial, I kept my head down. My hands were trembling. Warm, acidic tears streaming down my face. 

When Aelen’s mother spoke, I swear she looked straight at me. Like she knew I’d seen him and done nothing to save him. 

After that, I couldn’t sleep. Not really. With my eyes closed, Aelen would visit me. His twisted form and soulless eyes. I would be back at the dock, the gurgling of my name echoing around me. 

I would wake up in a cold sweat, gasping for air, feeling like I’d drowned. I couldn’t stand the smell of salty rot from my skin. The hearing of his voice, calling me, crying for me. 

It was the fog. 

I knew that now. 

The fog had taken Jara and Aelen. And soon, it would be coming for me. 

Then, December 14th hit, and the town was thrown into chaos. That year, the fog took someone different. Someone younger. 

*Chloe. Fifteen years old.* 

It wasn’t supposed to happen. It never *happened* before. The whispers were always reserved for the older ones. The adults. At most, it took teenagers who were crossing over into adulthood. Maybe they were strong enough to handle it. 

Not Chloe, though. She was just a child. 

It was the first time the fog had chosen someone so young, and the town could feel it. The rippling horror no one dared to confront. 

The adults tried their best to hide it. Hushed voices, eyes darting, voices tightening. But the panic in their faces was hard to hide. 

My parents kept me close. Told me to stay inside. To never go even remotely near the docks again. I knew what it meant. I knew what I had done. 

It was a tragedy. A violation of the natural order. 

And I was to blame for it. 

The town tried burying its grief in silence. Just like they did with Jara and Aelen. Nevertheless, we all knew we weren’t safe. 

Chloe might’ve been the first. But she wouldn’t be the last. 

The time following Chloe’s tragedy, the town stayed panicked. In quiet ways, persistent and aggressive. Locks were changed, curfews reinforced. Even doors were bolted down. 

Every child was monitored closely, held onto like a single gust of wind would condemn them to the sea. Carrying them away forever. 

To no avail. Because next year, it was Jilon. 

He turned twelve just three days prior. He was bright, soft spoken, and we often built towers of playing cards during recess. He always wore mismatched socks and had a slight lisp. 

His parents loved him. He was an only child. Their little miracle. 

After Chloe, they went into lockdown. Literally. 

Their doors bolted down, windows sealed shut. They refused to let him out of their sight. 

He didn’t come to school. He didn’t go outside. 

I heard they even slept in the same room, to make sure he was never alone. 

But the fog doesn’t care about bolts. Or locks. Or love. 

It took him. 

The night before his memorial, the air filled with something loud. Awaking everyone. 

It was metal. Screaming. 

My parents barged in and held me down instinctively; they knew it had started again. I managed to slip from their grip and ran to the porch. 

In the street, families were starting to gather, spilling from their homes. In their coats and slippers, eyes wide and stunned. 

Surprisingly, the fog didn’t fill the air, which made it worse. It was clearer, visible to most. 

That’s when we saw where the sound was coming from. 

Jilon. 

Every door was bolted. Every window sealed. It didn’t matter. 

He wasn’t climbing out the window; he wasn’t walking through the door. 

He was squeezing through the mail slot. 

His bone bent in ways that weren’t just unnatural; it was impossible. A young boy who was folding himself. Flattening. Warping. 

His limbs staggered through the slot, one after the other. The metal screamed and tore as the slot stretched.

It shouldn’t have. It was a standard mail slot. But it was at least fifty times as big. Resembling a shrieking mouth. 

No one spoke. What could we even say? 

Of course, Jilon’s parents were screaming. 

Pulling. 

Pleading. 

He didn’t flinch. Didn’t cry. Didn’t blink. 

His face was blank and calm. Focused with the same distant stare as Aelen’s. 

His mother clawed at him. His father wedged a crowbar in the slot, attempting to stop him. 

The fog had already taken hold of Jilon.

By the time he made it to the dock, his body barely resembled the kind boy I’d known. 

His legs were fractured in four places. Some bones poking through his mismatched socks. 

He even slithered more than he walked. Then the fog swallowed him, while the town erupted in haunting screams. 

Jilon’s memorial was way worse than Chloe’s. Worse than anyone who had come before. 

Half the town didn’t dare to attend. Those who did wouldn’t speak. 

What made it worse was the sound of Jilon’s bones crunching as they moved him to the boat.   
  
A few people vomited. My father cried more than he had for Jara. 

The fog had made it very clear. 

It doesn’t care about age. 

Or innocence. 

Or protection. 

You can lock the doors. Board the windows. Even tie your child down and keep a weapon at your side. 

It won’t matter. When the fog wants you. It will find you. 

And I hear it.

As I’m lying awake on December 14, typing this, the clock is turning to 4:27 AM.

The whispering of their voices, crashing like waves against my ears.
