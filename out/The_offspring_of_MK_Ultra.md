To start this off my name is Carl Darns, I'm a history buff when it comes to the U.S Military and it's involvement in terrible experiments. Primarily MK Ultra as my father had worked for the CIA shortly after the program was shutdown. But anyways below is my attempt at archiving the nearly lost recording about "Project Hercules" the supposed offspring of MK Ultra. Now forgive me if there are any grammatical errors as this was not just a simple copy and paste as the original recording had no captions . So I had to watch it and go through the painstakingly process of write down everything said during the interview and I doubt I did a completely good job so please forgive me. lastly the reason for the Recordings become an almost lost media is NOT because of the government trying to cover it up that's simple a hoax, the website they were on went under along with all of their articles and although many people are still trying to uncover them it has been near impossible. However I did manage to find a portion of one via the way back machine although, the portion of this recording begins with Alice Carver walking on stage and shaking hand with the host Charles Maler and ends on a commercial break. This for all I know is the only part to be uncovered, so please enjoy.



Charles: Hello Miss Carver, welcome to the show, and might I say it is so nice that we could have you here with us today.



Alice: I'm sure it is.



Charles: I want to begin by saying that this interview will not be like the many others where you were ridiculed and protested against for your association with the project. it will be a calm and respectful discussion and if any of the audience members were to try and demean you they will be quietly escorted out.



Charles: cutting right to the first question, when did it start?



Alice: It start in 1964, only two days after MK Ultra was shutdown and all its information brought to where Project Hercules would take place, the Red Ridge research facility



Charles: why was it started?



Alice: It was started in the hopes of creating a one man army that would turn the tide in the Vietnam war and any future war for that matter, although it ultimately did not and was deemed a failure



 Charles: what failed exactly? 



Alice: well it just didn't meet what they wanted, that being a strong and defensive soldier who wouldn't die or give up fighting and could stop the impossible from happening, and he simple couldn't do that, he had flaws. He could take a lot of shots but blow him up and we'd have to stitch him together, therefore very stoppable



Charles: what is he?



Alice: A programed human shell altered to survive what would be otherwise fatal to any other human being, he has extensive knowledge of firearms and explosives with a firing accuracy of 88%



Charles: sorry, I meant Who was he?



Alice: He was a brave and willing subject who gave his body so that we could make something thought impossible, that is all I can say.         



Charles: Why is that and why do we know so little about him?



Alice: Well it's actually for his safety as, many of us on the team including him realized that if he somehow were remember who he was, that it would be hell, because not only would he barely recognize himself. But all that information coming back to him would be too much for his memory bank and would cause most of his memories to not process so he wouldn't remember everything about himself. he'd know that he wasn't this but also not completely know who he really was and he no doubt would lockup due to this.



Charles: Lockup?



Alice: Let me explain, we had an incident where two officers who weren't supposed to be near him, called by the male pronouns. This was during his development so we hadn't ironed out all the kinks, he didn't have any of his memories but did still retain a familiarity with some words like he/him and so when they called him that he was stuck in a state where he knew the words but at the same time didn't, causing him to stiffen and go into what looks like a seizure, ergo "lockup"



Charles: That sounds like hell



Alice: A lot of his early stages were, for instance his accuracy used to be 59% but that was below average so then we started digging. We removed his lungs as that was hindering his accuracy by around 10% and then we cut into his arms and legs to balance them out with rods that would lock and remain perfectly stationary and help further his accuracy.



Charles: They wanted a sharpshooter



Alice: No they didn't want a sharpshooter. They wanted someone who'd put the best marksmen and women to shame, but the truth is, that simply can't be a "someone" 



Charles: You said you removed his lungs, so he doesn't breathe?



Alice: He doesn't blink, eat, breathe, or sleep, those in this case are luxuries we as humans take for granted



Charles: How humans is he still?



Alice: About, eh I'd say 45%



Charles: What is the 45%?



Alice: His brain, skull, hands and muscle tissue 



Charles: Is there a reason these stayed and the others parts of him didn't



Alice: We kept his brain as it proved difficult to find a substitute for his memory as most failed to remember and store information quickly and correctly and we'd often find him forget the very thing he just learned. The rest we kept as a basis to keep him stable enough to stand on his own



Charles: So he is alive?



Alice: No, is organic parts are in fact dead they've just been changed those that they don't decompose or stiffen



Charles: But then what about his brain?



Alice: Okay apart of his brain is alive but that's about it and it's only a small part. His brain, the part that learns knowledge is basically a large stick of RAM that we can access and edit to allow him to learn what we want him to know and the living part of his brain stored that in his memories, that may sound a bit confusing and believe me it is, as he is very much archaic by today's standards, but then again there's nothing like him.



Charles: Alright moving away from how he works and was made, what good has he done?



Alice: He saved over 100 men during Vietnam, and although that is great that the exact reason the project was deemed a failure as that number was still considered too low.



Charles: So he fought with other soldiers, did they know what he was?



Alice: No, well some but most just thought he was a quiet guy who was a great shot



Charles: So they took a liking to him.



Alice: Of course they did, they even have him a nickname "the troop" 



Charles: Do you regret what you did to him?



Alice: Not at all he quiet literally asked for.



Charles: ahh okay well we'll be right back after this short break
