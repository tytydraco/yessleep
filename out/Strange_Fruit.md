The forest had come to life after the night's rain and smelled of petrichas. Monica and I took the path that led from the summer house down to the small lake, wearing thin bathrobes with nothing underneath. It was just us there and beyond the treetops the rest of the world had ceased to exist. We swam and ate watermelon, drank white wine and dozed off in the morning sun. 

When I woke up, I saw Monica squatting on the shore. She fished a black object out of the water and took a bite. It looked like some kind of strange fruit. 

I raised myself up on my elbows and asked, laughing, what she was doing. She scrambled up like a frightened animal and threw herself at me. Her hair covered her face like a curtain and I was seized by an eerie feeling that it was no longer Monica, but someone else, hiding behind it. 

When I tried to pull her hair back, she knocked my hand away and pressed me to the ground with a force that seemed to belong to a much stronger person. Roots and stones scraped into my back as she rode me with hard thrusts. 

Afterwards, she dove into the lake and didn't come back up, so I had to jump in and pull her out. She was unconscious. 

She claimed she didn't remember what had happened, but in the evening I heard her crying quietly into her pillow.

Now we are on our way home.  Monica sits in front of the wheel and I doze off in the seat next to her and fall into a familiar dream. It begins, as usual, with me standing on a red beach looking out over a green sea spreading out under a black sky. A towering creature rises from the waves and wades towards the shore with great strides. With each dream it has come closer, but now it is no longer there. 

I wake up with a jolt, dazzled by the sun creeping down behind the trees. The speakers play Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".

"Southern trees bear a strange fruit      
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root  
Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze  
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees"  

It occurs to me that I haven't listened to the lyrics properly before. Only now do I realise that the song (of course) is not about bleeding fruit, but about lynchings of black Americans in the South. In my dazed state, I think I see a caravan of lifeless bodies dangling from the treetops in time to the music. 

Suddenly, I see the sea creature from my dream standing barely discernible by the roadside. Its skin is covered in bark-like scales. Its body is reminiscent of a pine tree and its arms of branches. Its face is hidden behind the treetops. 

I glance at Monica. She has put on her sunglasses and seems to be lost in thought. She can't have seen anything. Just to be sure, I look in the rear-view mirror to check that the sea creature is not following us. Of course it's not. When you wake up, the dream's inhabitants stay in the dream. They cannot escape and hide in the forest. I look at Monica again to make sure I didn't say that last part out loud.

I fall back asleep without really realising it. Suddenly I'm standing on the red beach again, looking out over the green sea that spreads out under the black sky. Monica lies lifeless in the arms of the sea creature. They disappear into the foaming surf, while I remain motionless on the beach. 

When I come to, the car is parked by the roadside. Monica is kneeling in a praying position, between what I first mistake for two pine trees. As I get closer, I realise it's the sea creature, or rather an exact replica of it in wood. 

I ask Monica what she's doing, because by now I'm getting really worried. When she doesn't answer, I pick her up by the armpits. She hangs in my arms like a doll. Her hair covers her face, just like it did down by the lake, and I am seized by the same feeling again; that it is not Monica, but someone else back there. 

This time she doesn't protest when I push her hair away. It's not someone else, but it's not Monica either. Her face no longer has any features, but is completely flat. It gives way when I press my palm against it. It's wet in there. I rummage around with my hand and grab something. When I pull my hand out, I'm holding the black fruit that Monica fished out of the lake. 

The statue has a niche in its chest that is exactly the same shape as the black fruit. When I place the fruit in the niche, Monica collapses into the lingonberry rice. Green water gushes out of the hole in her face, transforming the landscape. 

I feel the niche closing in my chest, and I can move again. I kick away the man lying lifeless in front of me and step out onto the red beach. The green sea water pleasantly cools my dry scales as I wade out under the black sky. 

The human woman sleeps peacefully in my arms. Soon we will be home.
