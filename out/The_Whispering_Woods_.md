In the quaint town of Harper’s Hollow, nestled between the whispering woods and the churning river, there was an unspoken rule: never venture into the forest after dark. The townsfolk spoke in hushed tones about the shadows that danced between the trees and the eerie glow that seemed to emanate from the heart of the woods.

Jenny, a newcomer to the town, scoffed at such superstitions. She was a rational woman, a scientist who believed only in what could be proven. Yet, as the days grew shorter and the nights longer, she couldn’t shake off the feeling of being watched whenever she passed by the woods.

One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Jenny’s curiosity got the better of her. She decided to take a walk through the woods, determined to debunk the myths that held the town in its grip.

As she stepped into the forest, the air grew colder, and the silence was almost deafening. The only sound was the crunch of leaves underfoot. She walked deeper, her flashlight cutting through the darkness. That’s when she heard it—a whisper, so faint she thought she imagined it.

“Leave…”

The voice was barely audible, but it sent a shiver down her spine. Jenny shook her head, attributing the voice to the wind. She continued on, but the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

“Leave now…”

Jenny’s heart raced. She turned back, but the path was gone. In its place was a thick fog that seemed to swallow the light from her flashlight. Panic set in as she realized she was lost.

The whispers turned into murmurs, then into a cacophony of voices, all repeating the same warning. “Leave before it’s too late…”

In the distance, a faint light flickered. Jenny, desperate for a way out, ran towards it. The light grew brighter, revealing a clearing with an old, gnarled tree at its center. The tree’s branches twisted into the sky, and at its base was a gaping hole that pulsed with an unnatural glow.

The voices were deafening now, urging her to flee. But Jenny was drawn to the tree, to the light. She peered into the hole and saw… nothing. No, not nothing—a void. A void that whispered promises of knowledge and truth.

Jenny reached out, her hand inches from the light, when a hand grabbed her from behind. She screamed, turning to face her assailant, but it was just Mark, a local she had befriended.

“We need to get out of here,” he said, his voice trembling.

They ran, guided by Mark’s knowledge of the woods, until they burst out onto the riverbank, gasping for air.

The next day, Jenny packed her bags. She left Harper’s Hollow without a word, the whispers still echoing in her mind. The townsfolk never spoke of her again, and the unspoken rule remained unbroken.

But sometimes, on particularly dark nights, if you listen closely, you can hear the whispers on the wind, warning all who dare to listen.

“Leave… leave… leave…”
