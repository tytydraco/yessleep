I was at my grandparents' house, in the dining room, playing cards with my parents and uncles. It was around 11’oclock, maybe closer to midnight. I was 12 years old and it was summer break I was visiting my grandparents house in Maine for a family reunion. The house was in a very rural area and the closest town was about an hour drive away. You couldn’t see any of the closest houses from any point on the, multi-acre, farm-like, property. I mean, it was really in the middle of nowhere. I remember having the worst nightmares about that place for a good deal of my childhood. I remember some about spiders. Some about clowns. Some about, strangely enough, mummies.  But none of them were as terrifying as what happened that night.

So, we were playing cards and I had been drinking a lot of Pepsi that night so I had to pee… real bad. I got up from the table, ran to the bathroom, and heard the shower running. I knocked on the door and my uncle Greg was in the shower.  I just saw him in the living room moments ago so I know this shower had just started. It was the only bathroom other than the one in the basement.  And I couldn’t go to the one in the basement. I never could; That basement was, and still is very scary. Just dark, concrete, and weird metal sounds coming from the old wood burning furnace. But, honestly, looking back I really wish I just went to the cellar bathroom. 

My scared 12 year old mind had no other choice but to go outside at night to relieve my bladder. Now, I wasn’t stupid, I knew there was a motion sensor light on the side of the house, so once I got to there I would have plenty of time in the light to pee. I stood at the front door grasping the old brass knob in my hand. I could feel some bumps and scratches from years of use. Squeezing the cool metal helped me gather my courage enough to go out into the dark night. I opened the door and ran out of the house as fast as I could , jumping off the porch. And safely making it to the side of the house with the motion sensor light. It turned on and I started to pee.

I wasn’t much into my piss when I started to feel a real eerie and heavy feeling. Suddenly, I felt my eyes begin to water. I looked up and saw an empty field and a dark treeline at the horizon... Then, I saw it... My pee stopped immediately and a shiver went up my spine. I was frozen. In the distance, along the treeline, I see something, I can’t tell what it is. I know its something because it's blacker than the rest of the dark. It was a shadow and it was taller than the trees. But I could barely make it out. I felt it, the presence of an animal that knows you are there. But this was definitely not an animal or a human. I remember thinking “is my mind playing a trick? Is this real.”  But I knew it was alive. Then the motion sensor light went out. And it got dark.

I don’t know if you have ever experienced middle of nowhere darkness. But it went from light bulb bright to pitch black. I couldn’t see my own hands, if I had the strength to move them at the time. In this pitch black nothingness, my eyes were still focused on it. The thing I saw. I could still see Its darkness through the pitch black. I couldn’t move, I was terrified to take my eyes off it. I don’t know how much longer I stood there, paralized, trying to figure out what this thing was, but eventually my uncle came out and yelled “Bathrooms free.” And I snapped out of it, I turned around as quick as I could and ran to the front door, making sure not to look back. I made it in safely and I didn’t tell anyone what I saw. I was scared they wouldn’t believe me. I mean, I don’t even know what I saw.

The next night I couldn’t hold it and curiosity got the best of me. Somehow, I found myself back at the front door grasping at the doorknob. I was there for a little longer this time and was squeezing the handle a lot harder. I swear, I made more dents in it that night, I was grabbing it so tight. But I found the courage to go out into the dark again, running to activate the light. It turned on and I looked out. I scanned the shadowed treeline for so long. And I saw nothing… there was nothing there. And yet, suddenly, my eyes began to water as the motion light went out.
