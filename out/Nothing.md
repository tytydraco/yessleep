*“Beep, Beep, Beep”* A constant beeping, i can't escape it, i cant… I said this in my head as I woke up prepared to go to one of my last days of highschool ever. I got out of bed and threw some clean clothes on before walking by my mom saying bye “Mark make sure to do your chores when you get home” yeah, absolutely not. I get in my car and head to school just like normal 



*8:39 am* 



I sat in the first hour as bored as ever, god i hate math and just when i thought it couldn't get any worse the fire alarm went off. “*Beep, Beep, Beep”* As annoyed as i was, i honestly was happy to get out of math class and go outside. As i walked out of class something felt weird, nothing, that's what it was, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,

What's the point of life? Why do we work? God gave us everything to live and we sit here and work and work and pursue a pointless purpose. In the end what do we get? Nothing? Yes, you're correct. Why was God created? To give people a purpose. With no god, we live to live to live to live decades of you guessed it

Nothing



*7:40 pm*

It's almost time. As I sit in my chair, tell you this rundown of my day. I need to find the purpose. I'm tired of nothing.

I sit in first hour as bored as ever, **god i want to die**



Don't mock god, god will take, god doesn't give, 

  


Hello! My name is mark and im **NOTHING** 



Mark cant sleep, Mark cant sleep,

Yep, there's nothing, when you die you die. People will say things about god and going to heaven and hell but really take a second to think about that. Faith, that's what we were banking on. Marks dead, gone forever, close your eyes tight. This is what Mark is seeing forever. Can you comprehend forever? no , just like you can't comprehend nothing.
