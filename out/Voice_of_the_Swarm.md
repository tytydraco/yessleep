There are certain things about nature that are both fascinating and terrifying. A bear can smell you from over 10 miles away, a sturgeon can grow as long as a car, and a cornered prey animal can experience a burst of energy to stay alive from a hunting predator.

But the one I find most daunting, is the fact that no species of animal dominates the earth more than insects. In any one given area of the world, it is a ratio for millions of bugs to any one community. And let me tell you, there is nothing more haunting than seeing that for yourself.

A couple months ago, I saw the first one. As I was getting out of my car to head inside after a long day of work, I saw on the siding of the house was a strange looking insect. I knew we normally got the standard little pests around our property (mosquitos, flies, cicadas, ants, centipedes, etc.) since we lived so close to the woods. But this one was unlike any I've ever seen before.

It was a pale white dot, vaguely hairy on the exoskeleton, miniscule black markings covering the small pill shaped body shell, six minute spindly legs stuck out from the sides, and from what I only could guess was the head, I saw a pair of two red pinprick eyes, their shape almost similar to a bee's and a fly's mixed together.

For a little bit, it just crawled slowly along the house's side, and I had finished getting everything out for the night, and right as I began locking my car, it flitted off into the early evening air. So quickly that it was past the treeline by the time I got to the door to head inside. And that was the end of it, I had a normal enough night after that, and went to bed.

As I got up early the next morning, I opened the blinds in the kitchen to watch the sun go up as I had breakfast. The morning sky was hazy with a few clouds, and I went to take a shower. As I got back to the kitchen, I saw something on the window. In the dim lighting, I couldn't see it too well, and my glasses I had left in my room. I stepped a bit closer to the window, squinting. It looked like some kind of bug had landed, but I couldn't tell if it was some kind of fly or moth or something.

I quickly went to grab my phone left behind in the bathroom, and pointed it at the glass. I snapped a photo, and a bright light blinded me, I cursed at myself when I forgot to turn the flash off. But while I had blinked spots out of my eyes, I saw the bug on the window open some kind of shell on its back to fly away. As I watched it do so, in shockingly slow motion, I found myself surprised. A pair of wings had emerged from the bug's back that, even in the slow crawling sunrise, stood out. A mixing of dark and light spots and swirls decorated the insects wings in strange, almost shape like patterns. Like a Rorschach picture was painted onto the surface of the wing.

I went back to my room, put my glasses on, and took a look a the picture. While most of the photo was a bright ball of light, I did manage to catch it. It was the same type of bug that I had seen the other day. The disbelief was quick, but it made sense. Some insects were more active at night, and I had no control what bugs were coming onto the property. As long as nothing happened, it would be all good.

Over the next few days, I would see one or two of those bugs around the outside property of the house. On the windows, on the porch, on some plants that I kept outside, on the mailbox, and on the driveway close to my car. It was very small at first, barely noticable. That was perfectly fine by me.

But it wasn't long before thing got different. A couple weeks after seeing the first one, I had arrived home late in the day, close to sunset, and the sight that greeted me was an absolute shock. Bugs, dozens of them, all over the siding of my house directly facing the driveway. They were crawling and flapping their wings in place as they rested on the wall.

The sight made my skin crawl, as if the imaginary scenario of myself being covered in so many bugs had manifested into reality. The idea of being outside with those things made me shiver, but I shook it off, opening the door and staring into the window as I shut it. From the reflection, I saw some of the bugs had jumped off the house to flit in the air for a moment before settling back down. I locked up my car, and at the noise, the bugs began to fly. In a vague grouping, they rose into the sky, vanishing out of sight into the shadows of the woods, as if swallowed by a massive void.

That night was when things really began to settle in. After the sun went down, I had this strange feeling I was being watched. The neighborhood I live in is pretty isolated, everyone has a good amount of space between one another, so I never had to worry about anyone nosy. But the whole night, no matter what I did as a distraction, I feltile a pair of eyes were on me the entire time.

For the next month or so, they showed up a lot more. Those miniscule numbers of earlier days had tripled. They could cover an entire wall if they wanted to. They hung out on the sides, the porch frame, the bathroom window, even covering the back door light to the point of completely blacking it out. It was so sudden it made my head spin, and there seemed to be hundreds of them a week. To the point that I began to notice little details I never saw on them before. Each one had a different appearance: shade of red in the eyes, range of sizes, and the wing patterns, each one distinct and unique.

I did notice one thing about them though, they seemed to be repulsed by noise. Whether it be me sneezing, the car door slamming, the horn on accident, or even the TV being loud enough inside. This made keeping my house creepy bug free, and to help put my mind at ease. I knew they were bugs, and I, a million times larger and stronger, could easily take them out. But the eyes on those things...they were unnerving. I've never been one to be afraid of bugs, but something about these things give me a bad feeling. I didn't even know what species they were, since internet searches and books from the library were no help, so I have no idea how I can get rid of them.

I just kept telling myself it would be fine. I had my workarounds, and they're working pretty well so far. I kept a bug spray by the front and back door, just in case.

Everything took a nosedive a week ago, when they finally got inside. I had actually had the chance to come home early that day, and the sight of my house insect fre gave me a relieved pause that left me at ease. I made it back before they got here, so I can spend my time in my nice, pest protected home.

As I locked up my car, looking at my phone playing some music, a small shape fluttered in front of me. I look up, my heart dropped, a bug had landed. One. And it wouldn't be long before more came. I heard a faint buzzing sound from the woods, and from the tops of the trees, I saw a swarm of insects, enormous and foreboding, had emerged. The swarm looked as large as a bus, and the noise it made was rattling my very skull. It sounded like static, but like it was being warbled somehow, trying to make out any coherent noise it could.

I didn't waste any time, I bolted for the door, scrambling to get the key into the lock. I had only a little bit, and I can already heard the screaming static getting closer. A scattering of shadows ran across my skin as my nervous hands began to shake and dropped the keys onto the ground. I went to grab them as fast I could, but it was too late. The bugs had gathered around me in a second, buzzing all around me in a noise so loud my ears hurt, and I could feel them landing on me, biting and crawling up and down my skin and trying to get into my clothes.

I swatted at as many as I could, smacking myself to the point I knew I'd have bruises later, and frantically getting the door open. I threw the door open, and slammed it shut with my shoulder behind me. In my panic, I shook myself down of any bugs still on me, stomping them in the ground, and spraying them down, repeatedly until I was sure they were all dead. I didn't see any still moving, and I was sure I got them all off me, their bites singing but the source of them dead.

I could only be relieved for a second, before I felt something itchy in my ear. I felt around my ear for a second, and felt a small bump. I ran to the bathroom, and my fear was realized. One of them had gotten into my ear. I freaked, racing to grab the tweezers. I clamped them down onto the little thing, and pulled. But it didn't move. The bug had stayed where it was, and from the inside of my ear, I could feel those tiny legs scratching my ear canal, surprisingly sharo, like miniature thorns. But I needed to get it out, because if they were acting like that outside, I don't want them anywhere inside.

My fingers burned as I clamped that bug, hard enough to kill any normal one, and trying to get it out of me. But it wouldn't let go, as if the harder I pulled at it, the more it held firm. My ear was screaming in pain, and I knew by then I was bleeding from my ear. But I didn't care, I just had to get it out, and fast. My fingers were trembling from the force of my grip, and as I tried to twist it, the tweezers flew out of my grip, landing in the sink, and the bug was free. Before I could even grab them, I felt my ear feeling filled up, shoving deep into the canal and trying to go deeper. I screamed, the sensation feeling akin to a nail being shoved into my ear, and no matter what I stuck in there to kill it, nothing worked. I grew so overwhelmed by pain, I actually blacked out.

When I woke up it was night, pitch black, and still. For a brief moment I had no memory of what happened, but the afterburn deep within my ear had quickly reminded me. I sat up, a bit off kilter and dizzy from what I prayed wouldn't be permanent ear damage. But even through the pain, I could hear something. A soft litany of what I assumed were the sounds of air moving through the vents, or maybe the wind outside, but the more I listened I couldn't deny it.

They were voices. Small, far away, and blending together, but they were voices.

And the more I listened to them, the more scared I felt.

"Let us in..."

"We can see you..."

"You can't hide in there forever..."

I got up to quickly make sure that all of the windows and blinds were drawn, but the complete darkness of the house made it impossible to move around in. I couldn't see any, and I didn't know what happened to my phone between me running inside to the moment I woke up. I felt around my way to the kitchen, and found a flashlight on top of the fridge. I clicked the light on, bright LED nearly making me go blind, and nearly screamed at what I saw. In front of me was the window to the back of the property, and all over the glass, in the middle of the night, were hundreds of bugs, white bodies crawling in clusters, and their red eyes reflecting back like the taillights of cars, all of them looking at me.

I didn't know what else to do. They were so many, you couldn't even see around the edges of them, and I was suddenly very scared of being here for the night. I flicked my flashlight up and down the window trying to see for any hole to the outside, when a small few began to leave. Where I pointed the flashlight, there would be 2 or 3 that would fly off. And before those gaps could be filled by more bugs, moonlight streamed into the house. This gave me an idea, and I ran to all of the rooms and turned on all of the lights. Lamps, overheads, decor, it didn't matter. I didn't stop until I had all the blinds open and every bright light turned on. That had gotten the ones clear from the windows, from inside, I watched as thin tendrils of bug clouds had vanished into the darkness. But I knew there were more, in places where the light couldn't reach them. On the roof, on the sides, in the gutter, anywhere they can crawl on.

From outside, I can still hear them, I can hear the bugs talking to me. Threatening me. Saying they would follow me. Saying they will hurt, kill, and use my corpse for their eggs.

I just holed in my room, sleeping with the lights on. The next morning, they were gone, and I didn't stay long enough to see when they would come back. I packed a bag for a few nights and ran outside to drive away from the insect house of hell. I got a room for a motel, and that has been where I've been staying for the last week. I'm not sure what I am going to do next. My thoughts on calling an exterminator are a bit mixed, I didn't want to live with them there forever, but I wasn't sure if getting another person involved with those... things would be a bad idea. I have thought about going into the woods where they fly off to to hide during the day, but the idea would surely result in something bad. I don't know what to do. I've been relaying this story to everyone I know who can hopefully give me a place to stay in order to stay safe and away from the bugs.

I'm going to hold out for a little while longer,  and hopefully I can last long enough to get them out of my life, before they find a way back into mine. And soon, because I am fairly certain I heard my name being whispered outside my motel door.
