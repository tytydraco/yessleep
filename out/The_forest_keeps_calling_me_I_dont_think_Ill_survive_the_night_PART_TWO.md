After hours of holding my breath and multiple panic attacks, the voices finally began to grow distance from my bungalow. After another hour or two of sitting there in silence and shaking in fear, I slowly stood up, choking on my own tears. After what felt like an eternity of thinking, I opened my bedroom door, strapped my rifle over my left shoulder and crept outside.

The door creaked as I pushed it open, making me joult before realising it was just the door. I peered outside before slowly walking out, leaves crunching beneath me as normal. Everything seemed the same but I knew they would come back like the previous two nights. I spent this time hunting for enough food so I don't have to risk hunting and night, gathered some materials and planned to head back by 6:30PM, around 2 hours before the last insident began.

I considered calling the police multiple times but knew they wouldn't believe voices calling me then trying to supposedly kill me. I got to my bungalow a little late, 6:42PM, with two rabbits, some dryed wood fire and some berries, pears and some green leaves for tea. I lit my fire, made some tea and sat on my couch. Sinking in the wool, sipping my tea and the sound of the cracklinf fire gave me peace at mind yet I knew I'd have to prepare soon. At 7:38PM, I stood up and began nailing remaining fire wood onto the windows and doors, leaving gaps in the windows hoping for a peak at whatever they are. I knew I needed to escape this forest soon yet knew it would take me days on foot and though I could call a taxi during the night hoping it arrives during the day, I knew if they died there blood would be in my hands and I couldn't live with myself if that happened.

In the mean time, I knew I was safe inside as they, as I realised last night, shouldn't come inside. I still protected my doors and windows just incase they do but felt it was a waste of wood. It wasn't.

As my watch turned 8:00PM, I held my breath hoping for the best and it was fine. As the handle ticked and turned, I grew more and more worried and dreaded what may happen. At around 8:23, it began. I heard light knocks on all the windows, doors and walls like they were waiting for me to come outside. Suprisingly, there wasn't any voice until much later, which at point, the knocking had turned into banging as the bungalow lightly rattled under the pressure. I gripped my rifle tighter, preparing for the worst. At this point, I heard the voices. "PAUL, OPEN THE DOOR!" It had gone from a man's voice to blood-curling screaming and my ears were pierced with the screach. I stuck my finger in my right ear, still tightly holding my rifle with my left hand. 

The wood began to slowly crack and I began to see more through those small cracks. There were giant bodies of shadows, darker then the night itself. The eyes were now jumbled shapes and had now turned a crimson red. I held my gasp in trying not to bring attention to the bedroom but aimed my rifle at the window and would of shot if it broke down. Luckily, at this point, it was well into the dawn of morning and the shadows had began to calm down and slowly but surely grew distance from my bungalow. I yet again had been crying all night and could feel the dried tears on my cheeks while new tears replaced the old. 

I curled into a ball when they had gone, sobbing to myself in thankfulness I had lived. I looked up at the windows and only then did I realise, the wood was completely destroyed yet the windows were unscathed. It's like they wanted to just watch me as I sat in fear. Did they feed off of my fear? Had they taken a liking to me? Whatever the reason was, I didn't want to stay to find out.
