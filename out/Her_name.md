I loved her. She was part of a cult where women were married off at a very young age. She was just thirteen when she was forced to marry a man who was at least a decade older than her. She didn’t tell me much about him. I asked her sometimes, but she would just laugh it off or pretend she didn’t remember anything. 

The only thing I know is that he was the reason she decided to run away with her baby. She was just nineteen. That’s when I met her. I barely remember anything before I met her. I had big dreams. I wanted to shake the world; I wanted my name to mean something, but there isn’t a lot you can achieve without proper education or useful skills. 

My only option was to spend all my savings and move to the city. Initially, I was overwhelmed. I wanted to go back, but I was broke. Somehow, I became a cab driver. Driving late at night in the city of dreams, where nobody sleeps. It was hard. I still remember sleeping in the cab or on the road. But by the time I was twenty-three, I had a place to live and food to eat. 

And then I met her. It was post-midnight. I still remember her holding her baby as she approached me and asked if I knew a place where she could stay the night. She said she had no money but would pay as soon as possible. I wanted to say no, but then I heard her baby cry and noticed her black eye, which made me reconsider.

I said I knew no place but was willing to keep her at my place. After seeing her reaction, I added that I wouldn’t touch her or her baby. She was skeptical but agreed, so I took her to my place.

I can still picture her face as she clutched her child closer to her heart while I led her to the basement of a popular Chinese restaurant where I lived. It was very small. I could literally touch both walls by standing in the middle and stretching my arms. I could even turn the lights off with my feet from the mattress. 

I was embarrassed to have brought her there. I expected her to be grossed out by my place. To my surprise, she thanked me for letting her stay the night. She slept on the mattress as I slept on the floor. I had a pillow, though. The next day, I woke up late and saw that she and her baby were gone.

I rushed to check under the mattress where I had hidden my money. I felt a deep sense of relief when I saw nothing was stolen. I didn’t think much about it and left for work. When I returned, she was waiting outside. The moment she saw me, she rushed towards me and handed me some cash while her baby played with her strikingly shiny hair. 

She said it wasn’t much and promised to pay me more later. Then, she reluctantly asked me if she could stay with me until she got a place. On the other hand, I choked on the sight of the money. I’d never seen that much money at once. 

Seeing my reaction, she got confused and became apologetic for not paying enough. I don’t remember what my reply was, largely because I was in shock- but whatever it was, it made her chuckle.

So, we began to share the basement apartment. She always left before me and usually returned long after I did. 

As time passed, I began to notice that she was covered in cuts and bruises. Some of them even appeared fresh. Even though it bothered me, I never talked about them. Instead, I opened up about my own life and occasionally asked her questions or for her opinions, hoping she would put her guard down.

I’d share the smallest details of my day. From the endless traffic during my trips to how much I hated the city. I would share stories like the time when a passenger fainted in my cab and how relieved I felt when someone called the passenger’s phone and came to help.

I would talk about everything- my hopes, dreams, even my fears and frustrations. 

I hoped she would open up, but she didn’t. I didn’t know what her job was, from where she was, or even her name. Even though looking at her and her baby, I knew there was a reason why she didn’t want to talk about herself, it was still really frustrating. 

Eventually, I stopped talking. Our conversations faded into silence. We would occasionally exchange a smile to acknowledge each other’s existence. We would just mind our own business.

Then everything changed.

One morning, I woke to the sound of her baby crying. I called for her but soon realized that she wasn’t there. It was really odd because she never left without her baby. I rushed to check on the baby and noticed that the baby had a big wound across the right arm from which blood leaked.

I grabbed the nearest thing—a shirt—and pressed it against the wound…

It was the first time I held a baby. As soon as I lifted the baby, the crying stopped. Wide, curious eyes stared into mine, and tiny hands reached out toward my facial hair. The baby cooed and giggled, managing to touch my beard.

I wanted to take the baby to a doctor, but when I removed my shirt to replace it with a clean towel, the blood had somehow vanished. The wound had left a jagged scar, but there was no blood. It was odd. Seeing this, I decided not to take the baby to a doctor till she came back.

Those hours were the strangest of my life. As I tried my best to entertain the baby by making goofy faces, I would be bothered by questions regarding her. Who is she? Why did the baby have a wound? Will she return? These thoughts became more intense as the baby began to cry again. 

I tried my best to soothe the baby. After multiple failed attempts, I realized that the bleeding had resumed. But there was nothing I could have done about that. I was already pressing the towel against the wound. I was really worried and confused. My anxiety levels were off the charts as the door opened, and she entered. 

The baby, seeing his mother, lunged from my arms into hers. She looked gleeful seeing her child. She cleaned the wound and put the baby to sleep. After the baby fell asleep, she began to weep. Her cries became louder with every passing second.

It took me an embarrassingly long time to fetch a glass of water, give it to her, and ask, “What happened?” Hearing my question, she began to control her tears. She took the glass of water and gulped it. After that, she began apologizing for leaving the baby alone without telling me; all those sorts of things. 

I used to hate apologies. To me, they were just words used to shut down a conversation. I guess my face gave it away that day because she stopped mid-apology. She turned back, glanced at her sleeping baby, and then took a deep breath. “Sit beside me,” she asked. The tone of her voice gave it a sense of urgency.

I slowly marched and sat next to her. She then kept her hand on top of mine, hunched over my shoulder, and whispered. 

“Promise me that you are not going to tell anyone.” 

She said, squeezing my hand almost in a threatening way. I nodded in sincerity. I never intended to break my promise, but here I am. 

This was the first time she decided to tell me some things about her life. The childhood, the cult, the marriage, the baby. But out of all the information she gave me that day, one stood out the most. Her name… She told me never to say her name in public. I wish I kept my word.

She and I started to grow closer after this incident. She began opening up and started sharing her thoughts and opinions. Slowly, I got to learn about her dreams, her aspirations, and even her fears. She didn’t tell me everything, like what her job was or what the deal was with the kid’s scar, but frankly, it didn’t matter to me anymore. 

Seeing her and her kid in the basement apartment always filled me with joy. All of a sudden, I was no longer an alcoholic, cynical loner who wanted to change the world while constantly blaming it for my circumstances instead of my inability or my inaction. They became my world.

I realized this when the kid called me “Dada.” It was an awkward moment, especially since she insisted that she hadn’t taught the kid to say it. But it felt earned. I had seen the kid stand. I had seen the kid fall. I had seen the kid run across the sidewalk just a few feet away from me. All of these things increased my heart rate, but for different reasons. So, when the kid said “Dada,” I was just overwhelmed.

Those were the best years of my life. I still remember the day I got a job as a full-time driver for a man who offered more than she and I earned together. I remember her jumping into my arms and kissing my lips when I told her the news. It was the first time that it had ever happened, and she was embarrassed. But, damn, that felt good.

The kid meanwhile danced around us. The kid had no idea why we were celebrating but was happy just because we were. As the child grew older into a young boy, we decided to move out of the basement and shift into a bigger apartment. 

The apartment was a crumbling concrete box with broken windows and toxic neighbors. I still remember the ex-owner casually talking about junkies in the area who sometimes broke into the cars and stole parts. He was so casual that no sane individual would’ve bought the house. We won’t have bought the house.

But we had spent three whole years saving money to get a house. And this was the only logical option we were left with after a long search. 

So, we bought the house and shifted. I remember every second of the shifting process. Taking a three-day leave, getting new stuff for the apartment, and shifting old stuff into the apartment. Every small little detail.

The one which stands out the most is when we got the television working. All three of us stared at the screen for literal hours. Our eyes almost popped out of our skulls. 

The boy initially slept with us because he was too afraid to sleep alone. We would try our best to make him comfortable in his room, but he would always come back to sleep next to his mother. The idea of not having his mother near him felt alien to him. 

But after weeks of convincing, he learned to sleep alone in his room. It was also the first night when she and I were in a room. No one else. It was very awkward since we never thought we would be alone in a room.

We lay in bed and were confused about what to do next. Before anything could happen, she decided to tell me everything I should know about her and the cult. And here is where things started to go wrong. Here are roughly all the things she told me about her past. 

Even though she was born into the cult, she never clearly understood its philosophy. As far as she understood, they believed that humans could only evolve by developing a sense of detachment from their environment. Every practice and tradition they followed was based on or derived from this idea of detachment evolution.

The cult gave its members little to no freedom and tightly controlled their actions and lives. They would tell them what to wear, what to eat, and how long to eat. Even though the cult approved marriage in the name of responsibility, there were rules that the cult members had to follow if they were in one. And they were generally forced to be in one. They would do anything to stop people from developing any sort of attachment. 

And there is no attachment greater than that of a mother to her child and vice versa. To counter this, the cult would snatch the babies away from the mother and give them to a group of women to raise just after birth. 

She and her husband were against this idea. They raised multiple appeals, but all of them were quashed. Plus, their baby was special as per the cult. They called babies like him the prodigy. Marked with a special scar. She never clearly understood what made them special, but she knew that her kid being a prodigy wasn’t a good thing. Therefore, with the help of her husband she escaped the cult and came to the city.

Multiple times while telling the story, she had massive emotional outbursts. Especially while talking about her husband. She narrated the story all night and fell asleep in the morning.

I had never seen her so vulnerable. That was all I wanted. To know her entirely. But now that I knew everything, I wished I had never found out everything about her husband. When she said that “he was the reason why she decided to run away with her baby,” she never meant it to sound negative. He was the person WHO convinced her to run away with their baby.

All of a sudden, my perception of this man changed. I thought that he was some abusive, exploitative man, but after hearing the entire story, I was not as sure. “He was a pedo,” I would remind myself until I realized that she had run away with her baby when she was nineteen. So, it was more than likely that she had conceived the baby by the time she was eighteen.

Yeah, she was still underage when they got married, and there was an unfair power dynamic in their relationship, but the fact that this man was maybe not a child molester bothered me. I started to feel like a rebound. The thought that she had another man in her life who she still loved broke me. I felt deeply insecure. And this feeling kept on increasing.

I should have talked to her about my thoughts but restrained myself. I would still act normally near her, but she could still sense something was off. She would ask what happened, and I would lie. Then I got fired. This drove me back into alcoholism.

I started to waste a lot of our savings on liquor. I used to drink and hang out with a lanky junkie in our area. He talked less and always wore white oversized full-sleeve shirts. I remember asking him once why he wore them, and his reply was, “to hide my syringe marks.” Sometimes, he had to carry me back to my home…

Initially, she tried to help me. She would try to cheer me up by sharing weird facts or mimicking characters that came on the television. She would bring gifts like sunglasses for me and even once tried to convince me that I looked like Arnold when I wore them.

However, our deteriorating financial condition forced her to work for longer hours. Her work-induced exhaustion, mixed with my pathetic tantrums, created a toxic concoction that started to corrode our relationship. I still remember our first major argument. It happened because I took offense when she compared me to a man in a soap commercial. Her overall harmless remark led to a loud verbal sparring match. I had never raised my voice at her before this. This fight felt so unusual that I couldn’t sleep that night.

But the fights did not stop. I didn’t stop.

The triggers of these arguments were sometimes as little as the position of the curtains. The fights grew more frequent and intense. There were even occasions when I threw objects on the ground; my mind flooded with the thoughts of hitting her. 

Things became more strained when, one day, the boy came back from his school crying. I cannot remember why he was crying, but I cannot forget the fight I had with her. Both of us were screaming at the top of our lungs as the boy's cries became louder. I remember her calling me selfish. She was right, but I didn’t get it at that moment. I was deeply offended by her remarks. After all that I did for her. Did it for her child. Did for us...

…I slapped her.

The kid ran into his room and locked the door from the inside. She started to bang on the door and asked the boy to open it. She pleaded for what felt like hours and rushed inside as soon as he opened the door. I, on the other hand, stood frozen. I was lost. I’d never felt so guilty in my life.

It was this moment that taught me the meaning of an apology. They are not words used to shut down a conversation. They are words used to start an honest discussion. To admit your shortcomings. To convey that you are sorry.

When she got out of the room, I tried to apologize, but she just ran inside the washroom and stayed inside for literal hours. I would occasionally feel the urge to knock on the door and ask her if she was better. To tell her she was right and I was wrong. But I didn’t. I wasn’t strong enough to admit that.

After she locked herself in the washroom, I went to check on the boy. The boy didn’t make any eye contact with me. I got on my knees to say something to him. But then I saw his scar. It was bleeding again. I rushed to get a bandaid, but by the time I came back, the wound was back to the scar, and the blood had vanished like all those years ago.

That night, she went to sleep in the boy’s room. 

The whole night, I kept on thinking and tried to come up with solutions to mend our relationship. The next day, I resumed driving my taxi. When I came back, I bought a gift for her. A beautiful necklace. But she refused to open my gift. That’s when I realized how badly I had damaged our relationship.

I avoided fights, cracked jokes, and even took them out to dinner. I kept trying all sorts of different things to fix our relationship, but nothing seemed to work. In hindsight, I was doing good. The kid started acting normal near me. I had fewer fights with her and even saw her once wearing the necklace I had gifted her.

But I didn’t pick up these details. Because of the friction in our relationship, I could only think about how she didn’t want to fix our relationship. She wanted to move on. I would even have nightmares where she left me for her husband with her child. Our child.

Thus when the junkie asked me what her name was, I told him. I knew she had said never to take her name in public, but out of spite, I took it. I wish I had thought twice about it. I wish I had taken some other name or just had somehow forgotten her name. I say this because the moment I said her name, I knew I fucked up.



NISHAYA.



The junkie started to act weird as soon as he heard her name. He stood up and began to leave in a hurry. It was really odd, but then I saw him tightly gripping his right arm with his other hand. I paid close attention and realized that it was bleeding.

Seeing his bleeding arms made me realize that he didn’t wear full sleeves to hide his syringe marks; he wore them to hide a scar. A scar just like the kid. He was also a prodigy.

When I realized this, I gave the junkie a chase, but he just sort of disappeared a few meters in.

On my way home, I was filled with a lot of thoughts. I knew I had messed up but didn’t know the extent of my mistake. At first, I felt that the junkie might be her husband, but I soon debunked that idea when I realized he was even younger than her. Then, my brain was filled with all sorts of conspiracies. He was her brother. A co-conspirator. A refugee.

But all of these thoughts were suppressed when she opened the door. All of a sudden, my brain started to focus on each and every detail of her face. From the color of her soft skin to the depth of her facial scars. Every small detail of her face felt unique and fresh, as if I had seen them for the first time.

It was the moment I realized that my time with her and the kid was now limited. It was also the moment I felt that it might be the last night I would spend with them…

I have lied to myself a lot about that night. Sometimes, I tell myself we had the biggest fight ever, and she finally said she would leave me the next day. Sometimes, I daydream that somehow I fixed everything with her, and she and the kid were in my arms as we stared at the TV screen and fell asleep on the couch. Together.

I have lied to myself a lot to develop a fake sense of closure with her.

But deep down, I know it was just another night. A dull night, resonating with awkward silence sometimes broken by the insignificant noise of the clenching of utensils or the music of the television static. The three of us sat there, unable to make direct eye contact, disoriented by the smell of a damp doormat and the feeling of guilt, confusion and uncertainty.

I never told them about the junkie incident. Maybe I should have, but in hindsight, it would have just fetched some more very dull, awkward nights on the run till the inevitable day came.

It was a Sunday morning. I left to drive my cab before she woke up. I had picked up and dropped six people by noon. I had enough money for that day, but I didn’t want to go back home. I’m still not sure why, though. Maybe it was fear, confusion, or even denial about what had happened the previous night. 

After the sixth trip, I just sat in my cab with the windows up and the engine down. Stranded in the middle of nowhere. High on the smell of burning plastic as the sun tried to dig a hole in my thick skin. 

That’s when I saw them for the first time. Three men and a woman. Cloaked in unassuming clothes. One had a scar running along his right arm. The Junkie. All entered the cab at the same time.

Before I could even comprehend what was happening, a big man sat beside me. He tugged at his red shirt, revealing a massive scar across his abdomen. Then, he took out what seemed to be a white toothpick and dragged the toothpick across the scar, covering it in blood. The toothpick then turned blood-red, with which he scratched me on my neck. An icy shiver shot through me when the toothpick collided with my skin. My hearing faded, my vision blurred, and all my senses slipped away—until I heard the Junkie’s voice.

“Take us to NISHAYA and the Prodigy,” he commanded. His voice had no emotion. 

My body started working without my consent. I could feel the movement of my muscles but had no control over them. 

I was terrified and confused. But after a bit of self-reflection, I calmed myself down. Then, I decided that I would try my best to gain control over my muscles. And I somewhat succeeded. It started with me gaining control over the tip of my fingers. Soon, I could feel my wrists.

With a limited amount of control over my body, I devised a plan.

I pulled my wrist off the wheel, hoping the car would crash in the intersection ahead of us. For a moment, I thought I won, but then my leg pressed the brake pedal. The members gave me a look of disappointment, and the big man soaked the toothpick, which was now pale red in his blood. After it was back to blood red, he scratched me again. All of a sudden, I lost control over the muscles that I had previously won back.

This still didn’t stop me from resisting. Whenever I gained even a little bit of control over my wrists, I would try to sabotage the car—taking wrong turns, Not moving them at all, Even hitting my wrists hard across the wheel in hopes of breaking them.

But nothing worked. The big man got in the rhythm of scratching me. Because I was powerless, I decided to focus on the cult members instead of trying to resist. 

All of the cult members appeared to be in their mid to late twenties except the junkie. 

The big man was conventionally unattractive yet intimidating. The Junkie, on the other hand, was extremely handsome but lacked the presence of the big guy. These two were the only ones who talked in the car. Their conversion, though, was in some alien language.

They were also the only ones whose faces I clearly remembered. Over time, many of their features have faded, but I'm certain I would recognize them even now. 

I barely registered the appearance of the other two, likely because I only saw them peripherally. I recall the third person being bald and dressed in black. The girl was pale, but that's all I remember about her. Both of them barely spoke, especially the girl, yet it felt like she was the one in charge, and the bald man was her second in command.

As we got closer to the apartment... My mind got distracted. Trying to relive every memory I had spent with Nishaya.

Our first meeting, Our first kiss, Our first fight.

All of these bittersweet memories, combined with the horrifying reality I was stuck in, forced me to shed a tear while still under the control of the blood magic.

I vividly remember when my body pulled over the car and got out. The car was parked in the wrong parking spot, but it was close to the elevator. The members followed my body’s lead. The junkie was in rough shape and needed a walking cane for support. The scary thing was that I never saw any of them holding a cane while entering the car.

As we got closer to the elevator, I saw my neighbor, an old lady, standing in front of the elevator door. Waiting. I wanted to yell and ask for help but couldn’t. As soon as I came close to her, she started to stare at me with chagrined eyes.

Even when all six of us entered the elevator, she just kept staring at me. She didn’t utter a word; just stared. It was extremely unnerving, as if I was the only one there with her in the elevator.

When we finally exited, she was the last to step out, her gaze still fixed on me... I don’t even recall her blink. She stood behind all five of us when I rang the doorbell, and the kid answered the door. 

After that, my memory just goes blank. Not a blur, a blank! I don’t recall anything. 

The last thing I remember is the ringing in my ears as the door opened. Then suddenly, I was standing in front of Nishaya, heavily sweating with my fingertips covered in blood. She pointed a knife at me in the living room, and I could hear the kid yelling and banging on his door from the inside of his room. I could even feel the presence of the cult members.

I still wonder what happened. All I remember is that three of the four invaders were standing behind me, and the girl was sitting on a chair, now holding the cane. 

But the thing I remember most vividly is Nishaya. She looked disoriented and tired. Her face was pale, and her eyes were wide. Strands of her frizzy hair covered her eyes, their shine now missing.

Did her hair lose its shine that day? Or was it missing even before that, and I didn’t notice?

Her breaths were audible, and her hands were shaking. With her back towards the walls, she pointed a knife towards me. Exhausted yet fearless.

I, on the other hand, was lost. I still didn’t have control over my body. It felt like I was in an inescapable nightmare while overdosing on acid. Blurry, hazy, yet extremely detailed.

“Snatch the knife and plunge it into her heart.”

And don’t remember who said this. Maybe it was the junkie or the big guy. Or maybe it was me. Me couldn’t digest the fact that I wasn’t the chivalrous knight who saved the damsel in distress.

The next thing I remember is snatching the knife out of her hand- She didn’t put up much of a fight. Heck, she didn’t even try. 

My ears still resonate with the sound of her choking on her own blood. She tried to tell me something, but her voice was muffled by the blood running out of her mouth. 

The scene of her clawing her throat desperately, trying to get some air as I stood mere inches away, is ingrained in my memory. The visual of her life slowly leaving her body as the frequency of her scratches decreased still breaks me. The image of her lifeless body lying on the floor in a pool of blood with a fingernail stuck in her neck is…

The cult members didn’t even flinch seeing me kill her. After killing her, they instructed my body to lie face down with my hands behind me. Following this, the bald man handcuffed me, then gagged me and blindfolded me with a black cloth.

The last thing I saw was Nishaya. Her pale, lifeless face. Her eyes. Staring at me. 

This was the worst moment of my life. Pitch black vision. Pin drop silence. Being poisoned by the smell of my dead wife. Being dreadful of the fate of my child. Lying on the cold floor with my imagination running wild.

As I slowly started to get control over my body, I began resisting. I would try my best to get out of my binds. As soon as I got control over my mouth, I tried to yell but couldn’t.

Me gaining the ability to speak caused a commotion among the cultists. They began to sing. The song was really harsh and in an alien language. They took awkward pauses frequently. Sometimes, I could hear rhythmic feet tapping and the sound of someone jumping. 

They sang and danced till Nishaya’s blood touched my body. When it did, they stopped. All of a sudden, the entire room was so silent that I could hear my breathing and my heart.

I couldn’t tolerate the silence. It was then I realized that the kid had stopped yelling and banging the door but had no clue when he stopped. I knew something was going to happen but didn’t know when and what. A part of me wanted to yell, to make noise, but I chose to remain silent. The silence persisted for what felt like hours, being occasionally interrupted by the sound of the moving curtains or the sounds of something being dragged.

I could hear my heart in my mouth. I froze myself in the hopes of catching some sound. Meditating and continuously praying for the well-being of my son. I could feel the vibrations of the hymns flowing through my veins. I could sense the stillness in the air.

Then, all of a sudden, the silence was broken by the agonizing screams of the kid. I panicked but didn’t know what to do. I tried to break free from my bonds but couldn’t. Then a cultist came close and said, ‘Please say, I give up the custody of my child.’

I shook my head in denial. What followed was the most agonizing cries for help I have ever heard.

“DADA!”

Thus, when the cultists removed my gag, I said what they wanted. To save the kid. My kid.

When I said what they wanted me to say, everything went silent once again. I could hear the kid being dragged out of the room. Part of me wanted to ask the kid if he was okay and tell him everything would be fine, but I didn’t want to lie to him. 

“DADA!”. The kid’s cries for help were the last words I ever heard from him. 

My inner urge to fight back died after I said those words. I accepted my fate and was mentally preparing myself to die. I was hoping that they would give me a peaceful death and wished that the kid was also blindfolded.

After a few minutes, two men picked me up from the floor and started to take me somewhere. I felt the change in the air when they took me out of my house.

I could have screamed or resisted, but there was nothing left to fight for. I just wanted to die. But to my shock, they uncuffed my hands and put me in the driver’s seat of my car. Still blindfolded.

I could sense someone was sitting next to me. He had sat in the seat so many times that I could sense that it was him. My son. I stretched my arm to touch his face to make sure it was him. To my horror, I could feel something slimy on his face. My first instinct was to remove my blindfolds to see what covered his face.

Before I could do that, a hand from the back seat grabbed my hand and pulled it back. 

“Do what we say. If not for yourself, do it for the kid.”

I obliged. Then they instructed me to drive my car blindfolded. I tried to protest, saying that it was too dangerous, but they didn’t even bother to respond to my plea and just said, “Drive straight.”

It was the most nerve-racking moment of my life. They would instruct me to go left, go right, change lanes, and even instruct me when to press the gas pedal and when the brake. I would frequently make mistakes while driving. I would bump into things, take wrong turns, and even mess up gas and brake pedals.

There were moments when I just wanted to ram the car into something at full speed and kill everyone inside, but since my son was sitting next to me, I didn’t. After what felt like hours of driving, they told me to stop. As soon as I pulled over, someone scratched me as they got out with my kid.

“Keep on going straight.”

As my body resumed driving, I felt I was going to die. I mentally apologized to the kid and just drove. When the car rammed into something, my thoughts at that time were, ‘It is finally over.’ 

But life had some other plans for me.

The next thing I remember is sitting across from two police officers. One of them was reading a file while the other was staring at me.

“We found your wife with a knife plugged in her heart at your home. The knife had your fingerprints. There is no sign of your son, but we did find a tooth that most likely belongs to a kid aged between four and nine. You are an alcoholic. Your blood alcohol level when we found you was, let's just say, above the legal limit, and you rammed your car into three cars at high speed. Plus, while talking to your neighbors, an old lady who lives next to you said that you had been abusive towards your wife ever since you got fired. So, what did your wife say that you took her and her kid's life for? Divorce?”

Hearing this broke me. I began to cry uncontrollably in front of the officers. It was a very odd feeling. Hearing something that was false yet right.

I tried to tell him the entire story, but they didn’t believe me. Or the judge. Or even my lawyer.

Honestly, I don’t blame them. Even saying these things out loud makes me think I am insane, but I know I am not. During the trial, I even requested that my house and car should be properly examined for potential evidence. But my request was quashed.

Lifetime imprisonment. Many say that it could have been worse.

Prison was an experience. There is something unsettling about seeing and meeting people who committed pity crimes and still ended up there, making you realize that YOU are guilty. Initially, it was hard. But two decades are more than enough to adapt. I got to make new friends, learn new skills, and even developed a habit of reading books. To me, prison was more of a school than my actual school…

Last year, I found out about my liver issues. Who knew a lifetime of heavy liquor consumption could take a toll on your liver…

Then, with the help of Ms Uma(who is also typing this), I got here in this hospital. Here, my condition went from bad to worse. I don’t have much time left. So, I am asking for your help. If by any chance you know a man in his mid to late twenties or maybe early thirties with a big scar across his right arm, please share my message. Here it is:

Son, I know that you have either escaped the cult or you are trying to. I know this for a fact because you are a fighter. Someone who is willing to die to protect the people who they love. Just like your mother.

I am sorry. I am the reason why you are no longer close to her. It was my ego that separated you and your mother…

I‘ve thought a lot about the moment when we meet again. Things I’ll say to you. Things you might say to me. Things that we won’t even have to say to each other. But I don’t think that we will meet in this life. 

But I am sure that we will meet again. The first thing I will do when I reach the afterlife is to find your mother and rebuild our home. The way it was. 

We will get the exact cable TV, but don’t worry, we won’t turn it on. We will wait for you. It doesn’t matter how long you take. Decades, centuries, or even eons. Take all the time you need.

Just remember, we’ll be waiting in front of the TV, a seat saved for you. So that all three of us can stare into the television till our eyes pop out of our skulls.
