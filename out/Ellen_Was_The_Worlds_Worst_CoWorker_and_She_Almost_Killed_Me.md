I was voted Most Likely to Succeed in high school and that they still did those awards at my school should tell you how rural and backwards it was. So imagine the blush on my face when I was approaching my 10-year reunion and I still lived in that little town, in the house I grew up in, caring for my elderly Grandma. 

But Grandma died and like the universe knew, the company I worked for eliminated remote positions the week after. It was work in the office in San Francisco or be let go. So I left on a jet plane for the first time in my life. 

The office was sweet. All the stuff you hear about with Google and those companies - free food, a view of the Bay, a slide from one floor to another. Everything to try and make you never leave work. It also came with the world’s worst co-worker.

*Ellen.* 

Ellen said she was 4’10. I don’t know if she was even that tall. She said she was 25. I wasn't sure about that either. She could have passed for 14, or 49. She had what seemed like some kind of Eastern European accent, but she said she was from Arkansas, though she pronounced it “Our Kansas,” and a few times she said she was from New York. 

She was an absolute menace. She cooked fish in the microwave. She listens to weird ambient music with no airpods in. She wore exceptionally-revealing clothes but then would constantly accuse people of checking her out. She requested to follow every single person in the office on Instagram right after meeting them and her Instagram was constant pictures of her in a thong bikini even though she wasn’t in good shape. She stared. She really ~stared~. Like, you’d sit there for 10 seconds and she’d keep staring at you. 

It at first seemed like Ellen was just going to be the weird person in the office. Then it got worse. Much, worse. 

We all knew there was more to Ellen than just being a bad co-worker. We all felt sick. Not just like a cold either. We felt disoriented, haunted, and stalked - and it was always when she was around. 

Ellen has always found a way to feel victimized by everyone in the office too. Any little misunderstanding or disagreement was a blow to her heart. We felt like she was retaliating at all of us by striking us with curses, hexes, whatever you wanted to call it.

But we had nothing on her. No matter how hard we tried. 

We finally thought we caught a break when my “work wife,” Aly and I came into the office at midnight after coming back from a business trip.

The smell of burning greeted us when we stepped in through the front door. Then we saw the smoke. We followed it to the women’s restroom. I think the four canned margaritas Aly had on the flight gave her the courage to bust into the bathroom first.

Aly took out her phone and started recording as soon as she got in the bathroom. She screamed at me to record as well. We had stumbled upon Ellen with a fire going in a sink next to personal items from everyone's desks.

I watched Aly’s phone catch fire. Then mine did the same. Ellen’s eyes burned into mine as she tried to sweep away the ashes of her little ceremony. 

*We had her*. Our phones were toast but Aly and I got our videos off the cloud. We were in Cal's office first thing in the morning. He finally agreed to fire her.

Only problem…guess whose job it was to fire Ellen? HR, aka, me!

My hands were drenched with sweat when Ellen walked into my office and sat down. I had never fired someone in-person. And there Ellen was sitting, across my desk, chewing her nails the way she always did, getting dandruff on my chair, and giving me that 1,000-yard stare. 

I made it quick. She had been caught in the office after hours doing inappropriate activities. I thought she might not care. She seemed to not give a fuck about anything, but then I saw the tears swell in her dark eyes. 

I was about to say something when the knife came out and she swiped it across her neck. The blood poured out from the slit immediately and I vomited. I picked my head up and saw her walking out into the heart of the office, drawing out a chorus of horrific screams before she collapsed on the floor. 

*I should have known that wouldn’t be the end of Ellen.* 

I was excited to go on my first corporate retreat. A resort on the coast. Free drinks. Free apps. I could sit through some keynote speeches and PowerPoints for that. 

Things got weird fast. We were all toughing it out through a Zoom presentation with some executives rambling on about “synergy” when a new window popped up in the meeting: the name was just E and it was only there for a flash, but there was no mistaking it was Ellen. We all saw it. 

We talked about it at dinner. Then drinks after. We got past it. I know at least for me personally the six aviations I had made me forget about Ellen. *I shouldn’t have.* 

A co-worker, James, and I consummated months of flirting by slipping back to my room. We made it to the bed filled with gin and future regret. He was on top of me when I first felt it - a sharp poke into my ribs. It stopped the fun immediately. 

I pushed James off me and flicked on a light. I got a flash of Ellen between us for just a second. I screamed and rolled off the bed. 

*Ellen was gone.* It was just James. Half naked. Blood on the half which was naked. Looking rather concerned at me. 

I looked down at my naked half and I saw an oozing wound on my side. A small puncture trickling out blood. Painful and familiar. It felt like something I had experienced before. A tattoo. 

But I had a new tattoo. A small one. The letter E, right at the bottom of my ribs, fresh and bleeding. 

What happened? What was I thinking with James? The incident sobered me up in the worst way in the middle of the night. I contemplated trying to get out of there. Telling the hotel. 

*Telling them what though? Your dead co-worker tattooed you in the middle of the night?* 

I stayed awake the rest of the night and tried to prepare myself for the last day of the big retreat. One reason I couldn’t bail was I had a huge presentation in front of the whole company I had to give the next day. I ran through the presentation over and over and over in my head until sunrise. 

The tattoo had moved. I noticed it as I blow dried my hair in the mirror. It was now on the top of one of my breasts. *Maybe I was so sleep deprived and hungover I was delirious?* I reached for it to rub it and it moved before my eyes, up onto my neck. 

I blinked and the tattoo was on my cheek. It rested there for a second and I tried to scratch at it. It burned my finger as soon as I touched it. I tried again. Another burn. It was there to stay. 

I covered it with a pile of concealer. The morning session and my presentation was about to start. 

I could feel the sweat running down my forehead as I stood in the bright lights of the stage. I was sure every single person in the company could now start to see the letter E get revealed more and more on my face with every breath that I took. 

But I was killing the presentation. Murdering it. I think it was the adrenaline in my veins, and the four cups of coffee. 

I clicked to go to my final slide. It had a video on it. *What?* 

The video started playing. It was dark, but it was clear what it was. It was my hotel room. I was in it. On the bed. With JAMES! It played as the two of us started to undress each other. 

The crowd before me became an ocean of discomfort and nervous chuckles. I didn’t even know what to do at that point. Especially after I saw her at the back of the crowd, standing there, and smiling at me. Ellen. 

I managed not get fired for the whole video thing but I was a dead woman walking at the company. There was no way I could ever grow there at all. I did everything I could to get a new job. 

There was relief though, for a few weeks. Then I made the mistake of staying late in the office one night. Everywhere else in the space was dark other than my office, which now looking back, I couldn’t believe I still used after a woman killed herself in it. 

The first sign something was bad was when I stepped in a wet puddle as I walked out of my office. I looked down and saw the blood pooled there, just like it had when Ellen had killed herself. I stayed standing in it as the door to my office slowly creaked open, on its own. 

The light in my office flicked out and I felt something slide up behind me. I felt the cold edge of a blade against my soft neck. 

“Why me?” I asked Ellen. “I didn’t make the decision to fire you, I just delivered the message.”

It hit me at that point the reason the company was so hesitant to fire Ellen was she was an exceptional hacker. I had sent emails trying to get her fired before and fielded them from co-workers and said I was working on it. She had probably seen them. She was clearly a spirit at this point, she knew everything. 

“Are you going to kill me?” I asked, about to pee my business casual skirt. 

Ellen did something worse. She disappeared at that moment and didn’t give me an answer. 

I thought I got off the hook until I got home and looked in the mirror. There was a new tattoo - this one on my neck. 

*I’ll come back wherever you go.* 

-

I got out of that job. I got another. A new “open concept office” with a view of the Bay. I spent a lot of money on concealer for my face and neck. 

The new job started fine. Just like any other. My first real thing I had to do was onboard a new employee. She apparently had been hired before I started. I thought nothing of it when I saw her paperwork. 

The VP of the new employee’s department walked her into my office on her first morning. The color of her hair was different. Her make up was different. She walked with a new limp and she wore a turtleneck, but there was no way it wasn’t her. Especially given the devilish smile she gave me when she gently shook my hand and said her name which I recognized from her paperwork…

*Nelle*
