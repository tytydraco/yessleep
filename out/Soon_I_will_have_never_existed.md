If you're reading this, I still exist.

It started with an argument at a bar. I don't remember much about how it started or what it was about. All I remember was one overconfident threat I made in my drunken posturing:

"I'll make you wish you were never born!"

I was drunk, but not drunk enough to forget getting the crap beaten out of me on the sidewalk outside. The other guy went back inside, and I returned to my car with a black eye and a bruised ego.

Just as my hand was on the door-handle, a voice came from the shadows.

"You know, you *can* do it, Chris?"

I jumped. Who was this, and how did he know my name?

"Who's there?" I asked, more embarrassed than anything else.

"You can make it so that someone was never born."

A thin man emerged from the bushes in front of my car. He was young and looked handsome, even pleasant. But something about him was off. I couldn't put my finger on it then, but today the best thing I can compare it to is all the AI art coming out. He was like a really good approximation of a person. Convincing, until you thought about it too long.

But I wasn't thinking about anything much at the moment.

"What do you want?" I asked.

"I want to give you a gift."

I sighed. Just wanting this guy out of my hair, I said,

"Great. Give it to me, and I'll be off then."

The man smiled. A shiver ran down my spine.

"Your trunk should do," he said. "Place your hand here."

Confused, and hoping to move things along, I put my hand on the trunk of my old Buick.

In a flash, the man lifted a knife and thrust it through my hand, deep into the metal exterior of the trunk.

I was almost too shocked to react. I'm not sure I even screamed. I remember trying to pull my hand away, but it wouldn't budge.

A broad smile passed over the man's face as he watched my blood spread across the blue exterior of my trunk. His eyes widened; his lips moved as if he were counting.

Moments later, he gripped the knife and pulled it out. And then something strange happened. The blood that was now dripping down the back of my car began to recede. Not back into my hand, but into the hole where the knife had pierced the trunk. I pulled my hand away and noticed the wound was already closing up.

"Anything you close in that trunk will have never existed."

Then he just walked away.

I shook my head and tried to make sense of what had just happened. Looking down at my palm, I noticed my wound had disappeared.

*Maybe I got hit harder than I thought.*

I drove home, took a shower and went to bed.

I would have chalked it up to the injury if not for the next morning. When I returned to my car in the light of day, there was a crimson *scar* where the knife had been.

I popped it open, and to my shock, it was spotless. All the crap I had kept in there—old clothes, some tools, a bunch of trash—it was gone. The trunk was spotless.

So, I decided to test it out. I grabbed a rock from my driveway, placed it in the trunk and shut it in. With a trembling hand, I opened the trunk again.

The rock was gone.

I did this half a dozen more times, with larger and larger objects—a branch, a crowbar from my garage. Then, I went ahead and dumped my entire trash can into the trunk. Each time I opened it, it was empty and spotless.

From that day on, my life would never be the same.

I started simple. Canceling my trash pickup and using the trunk as more of a garbage disposal. Then I got another idea. I took the next electric bill I got in the mail and made it disappear. I waited a few weeks, then a month. The next one came, but I never got a late notice for the previous.

So, all bills (along with tickets, fines and jury duty) now went in the trunk.

Even after the Buick died, I kept it in my garage.

Years went by, and I got married. I never told my wife about it. And I had to start garbage pickup again to keep her from getting suspicious. But the bills still went into the trunk.

Here's where the regrets start.

Seven or so years later, my marriage got a little rocky. One thing led to another, and I got into an affair with a coworker. After a few months, my wife found out. She blew up, of course, and threatened divorce. It was ugly.

That's when I had a terrible idea.

I got the old Buick running again and asked the girl I was having the affair with to meet me in the parking lot after work. I gave her some story about us getting together again. I don't need to share the details, but she ended up in the trunk.

I drove home, and as expected, my wife greeted me with a smile. Dinner was on the table and everything was back to normal. My affair had never existed. The next day, the girl's desk was occupied by another woman, whom everyone in the office had known for years.

I wish I could say that was the last *person* who ended up in my trunk. Well, she was the last *living* person.

I drove the Buick again for another year. And one night when I was a little drunk, I hit someone walking along the road at night. He slammed into the windshield, leaving a big dent. He was dead by the time I got out of the car. I didn't give it a second thought. Into the trunk he went. And the damage to my car was gone.

I've been living like this for twenty years now. Using the trunk of my Buick to make all my problems go away.

Until yesterday.

The man showed up again, this time in my garage. He looked exactly the same as on the first day I had met him.

"Chris… you've gotten a lot of use out of my gift, I see."

I stood there speechless.

"But, it appears you've missed quite a few opportunities. Garbage, bills… mistakes. You've made many things go away over the years. But it was all for yourself. Haven't you thought about the possibility of using it for good? Maybe you could have put murder weapons in there… saved lives. Or even those letters from your wife's mother that caused her so much distress. You could have helped so many people. But you decided to destroy and defraud."

I didn't know what to say. I just stared at him.

"You may have evaded human justice. But divine justice can't be thwarted… as long as you still exist."

"What?"

"I'm here to tell you that your trunk will only work one more time. Only once more. Use it wisely."

I tried to reply, but the man vanished, leaving me alone in my garage.

Since then, I realized what a curse that trunk had been to me. All the evil I'd done that I couldn't undo. And the more I thought about it, the more sure I became that the last thing I wanted never to have existed… was me.

So, I'm telling my story here. If you're reading it, I've not done the deed. Once I do, you'll probably forget you've ever [read this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/)
