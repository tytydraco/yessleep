The first time I saw something, I was deep down in the garage’s lower levels. I was patrolling the nearly empty garage, in a dim area, and heard a noise behind a vehicle. 

I thought for sure it was a prowler, but as I got closer, I couldn’t find anyone. I thought the thief was hiding. So, I searched around the few cars and inside them, scanning through windows.

I saw a reflection in the glass of a silhouette standing right behind me.

The hairs on my neck rose as the person seemed distorted. Something was off as its neck and arms were too long. Its features were obscured in the murkiness of the garage. It was just a dark shape about five feet behind me.

I quickly spun around but there was nothing there. 

At that moment, I felt a wretched vibe. I don’t know how to better describe it. A violent shiver ran through my body and my chest seemed to clench up like it was being squeezed by an invisible hand. An impulse hit me – I didn’t care if someone was breaking into a car, I had to get out of there!
 
I ran as fast as I could to the nearest emergency exit which was two levels up and about two hundred yards away. I burst out of the garage. The streets were empty. I caught my breath and regrouped. I thought it had to be my mind playing tricks on me. I felt like such a pathetic coward. Some security guard I was.

So, I should back up a bit and explain things. 

I was hired for the job three weeks before the very first covid lockdowns happened. Where I was, in Seattle, they started on March 23rd 2020.

I thought for sure they were going to just not hire me, but they told me that they were going to keep me on and instead furlough everyone else. I would act as parking manager, attendant, custodian and security as I had a background in security.

I actually started the job on March 13th as my background check needed to clear. The current manager there was retiring, and I only had ten days with him for training.  

The garage itself was enormous. It was over 1500 spaces and had 6 levels and 4 sub levels. The best way to put this into context is it was the size of a giant indoor shopping mall. Those big ones built in the 80s.

Worse though, is that this garage was cobbled together decades ago. Two large garages were connected by a new structure. This caused the garage to be incredibly difficult to navigate as it was a bit of an octopus. A cement labyrinth. It had many dead ends. It had stairwells and elevators that only connected certain levels. And because of the current state of Seattle many of the emergency stairwells and elevators were locked off to prevent the homeless and druggies from sleeping in them.
 
A large apartment building sat across the street. Many of its residents parked in the garage, so it had to stay open. There were only around 400 parked cars peppered throughout the garage and because of the lockdowns, they didn’t move much. I would check the reports and on average 3 cars moved a day and they only left for a few hours. Probably to get food. Most of the residents worked in the tech fields, so they were able to work remotely. Nobody else parked in the garage.

After that first encounter, I was shaken but not stirred. Unfortunately, the garage only had security cameras at the entrance and exit. With everything going on in the world at that time, I thought for sure I was just seeing things. This was the very beginning of the pandemic and there was a real hysteria in the air. 

I still patrolled the garage 3 times a day. There were some areas that I would quickly clear through, practically running through them. Nobody parked on these levels and they were creepy A.F.

I was told by the old manager that part of the Seattle Underground lay under the garage. There were remnants of an old hotel there. Most of it had been filled in when the new city was built over the old city. The Underground was a wild story in Seattle’s history. Because of the city’s original poor planning, they basically built over their first city at the turn of the century to make a better city. But then because of prohibition of the 1920s, some spaces down there, that weren’t completely filled in, became underground speakeasys, brothels, and gambling halls. A super shady place where many people disappeared. By the 70s, Seattle had cleaned many of these out. This information was never told to our parkers.

There were two places in the garage where there was access to the Underground. Both areas were covered with giant chain link fences bolted into the cement walls. A board was behind the chain link preventing any views beyond it. If anyone saw it, they would never know what was behind those barriers.

I always made sure that these fences remained firmly bolted down. One small area did look like someone tried to break through but didn’t succeed. Just going near these barriers creeped me out.

I thought about telling my boss about my first encounter. But I liked the autonomy of the job and just being left alone during this time. Most of my shift was spent watching YT videos in my office. Besides my boss seemed like a real flake. He had flaked on me twice at the beginning of my employment. When I first started, he said he would come by but never did. He said he had kids and was working remotely and lived two hours away. He then said we would have a call every Monday but then cancelled these meetings and just asked me to reach out to him if I ever needed anything.

I also couldn't call the old manager because I didn't have his number. When I took over the job, I inherited his work phone.

A week went by with no issues, and I thought for sure this was all behind me. During this time, the whole city shut down and the streets were mostly filled with the homeless and druggies. The whole world seemed upside down. I thought for sure it had to be some crazy person that got into the garage, and I was just a pathetic coward for running.

But then the big day happened.

I was already on edge as I was working down in the deepest subterranean level in a section near one of the fenced off areas that connected with the Underground. 

As I fixed a light that had went out, I heard a banging sound. It came from around the corner. I got off my ladder and tiptoed over to the sound. It came from one of the mechanical rooms. That room helped ventilate the garage.

I walked closer. It sounded like a weak person pounding on the door from the inside. But the acoustics of the garage amped it up and it echoed off the concrete. As I got closer, the sound stopped.

I stood there frozen.

A child’s voice then yelled from behind the door, “Help me, someone please help me!”  

All the air sucked out of me. I still stood frozen. The child’s voice then said, “Is someone there? Please help me! Is someone there?”

I said, “Why are you in there?” The child responded, “Someone put me in here. I don’t know why I’m here. Please let me out. I’m locked in here. Please.” The kid sounded desperate.

I took a step forward but paused. I remember warning signals pulsing through my brain. My body knew something wasn’t right. 
There was a tingle of that wretched vibe I had experienced before.
I thought about calling the police. Where I was in the garage did not have a cell signal. I would have to go up at least two levels and towards an exit.

I said, “I’m going to get you help. I’m going to call the police right now. I have to go upstairs though, but I promise I’ll be right back.”

The child begged me not to go. He pleaded, “Please don’t leave me here alone. I’m so afraid. Please just let me out. Please help me.”

I repeated that I would call the police. The child pleaded, “They won’t come fast. I’m so scared. It’s so dark. There’s no light. Please just let me out.”

I clutched my set of keys. I had keys to every door in that place. 

Something inside me was telling me to run. But the child started crying and begging me to just let him out. I thought to myself, I can’t be a coward.

I need to mention something about my past. When I was 10 years old, I was playing with one of my cousins at a frozen lake. My cousin fell in, and I didn’t think I could rescue him, so I ran for help instead. When I came back with my aunt, my cousin was dead. I blamed myself for his death all my life. Because I was a coward who didn’t try to save him myself. 

It was that guilt that made me take a deep breath and flip through my keys trying to remember which one it could be. I stepped to the door and started trying the different keys.

I heard the click as I found the right one. I then turned the handle and pushed the door open and stepped back.

“It’s open. Come out.” But he didn’t answer. I stared at the ajar door for an eternity. Nothing came out.

I then heard the child sobbing. It was hard to hear what he was saying. But it was something like, “I can’t move my legs. I don’t know why I can’t move my legs. Please help, I’m so scared…”

I cussed myself out in my mind. I remember my head shook trying to disobey me. I then stepped inside the room.

It was extremely dark inside but the room itself seemed cavernous. Since it was the ventilation room there was one muted beam of sunlight coming from above. Nearby there was a large shaft that went up. Sunlight spilled in from the very top, which was five stories above.

I stepped to it and looked over its short barrier wall. It went another two stories down which seemed very odd to me as we were currently on the bottom level of the garage. It had to have been connected to the old hotel down there. But I didn’t want to find out.

I said, “Where are you?” 

The child said, “I’m over here.”

It came from a dark corner. I said, “I’m going to help you, but you have to crawl towards me.”

I then heard something behind me like someone stepping on rocks. I turned and stared into this other dark corner. Something shifted in the shadows. It then stood idle for what seemed like an eternity. I stared into that blackness, searching for what it could be.

It shifted. 

I held my breath. 

It then moved towards me. Fast.

The child yelled, “Please don’t let him get me! Help me!”

I yelled back, “Come to me now!” But nothing did. I turned back to see a distorted body lumbering out of the shadows as it entered the light of the shaft. Its limbs were too long and the flashes of its skin that I saw were too pale. Its eyes and mouth looked like jagged voids. It was a streak of shadows and twisted limbs. 

It was blocking the entrance door, so I made a quick decision as I was scared out of my mind! I climbed over the short barrier wall and entered the shaft. My plan was to climb up, but I quickly slipped and fell two stories down.

I hit the ground hard, landing on my butt. I’m a runner, so thankfully my legs absorbed some of the shock. It still hurt like hell. But the ground there was covered in dirt.

My adrenaline kept me going. I looked up and didn’t see anything chasing me. Nonetheless, I didn’t want it to see me, so I crawled into the nearby shadows. 

It was like night down there, so I used my cell phone as a flashlight.

The shaft was adjacent to a room that had brick walls around it. In the distance, I saw an open doorway. I pondered going back up the shaft.

Something moved nearby. There was a column obscuring my view. I then heard a dragging sound. At first, I didn’t want to shine my light on it. But then I did.

I saw something crawling from behind the column. It was a black clump of limbs. Its arms dragged its body across the dirt floor. It seemed to have too many arms. Its long hair covered its face.

I quietly moved through the doorway to get away from it hoping it wouldn’t see me. The doorway connected to either stairs going up or a hallway into another area. I chose the stairs up.

My mind was racing. I couldn’t comprehend what I had seen and didn’t want to go back the way I came.

I thought of that weakness in one of the fences where someone had seemed to try and break through. It became my only hope – to find a way to the barrier gates and back into the garage.

I moved quickly and stealthily.

Upstairs, I stepped into a hallway. Old, worn wallpaper peeled off the walls. Most everything seemed to be made of brick or wood. I had to have been in that old, buried hotel.

I bolted down the corridor. My flashlight led the way. I entered a large space that looked like it was a bar and gambling hall at some point. There was a long dilapidated bar and several rotting tables and chairs. Twisted chandeliers hung from wood beams that held up the ceiling. Broken glass covered everything like dust. There was so much broken glass.

I remember the crunching sound of my shoes reverberating through the whole chamber. I tried to be as quiet as possible while still maintaining a quick run as I wanted to get out of there so bad!

My flashlight then shined across what I can only say was –

 – a very dark shadow of a person. I flashed my light all around encountering more of these shadow people. My light passed completely through them, but you could still see traces of black shapes. They were like silhouettes made of dark smoke.

I then realized that there were many more of these shadow people all around me. More than a dozen. As my light beamed across them, they just drifted there watching me like statues in a graveyard. Their features obscured in a dark haze.  

At that moment, I felt two powerful hands grab my shoulders. Bursts of red hot burned my skin from the touches.

I twisted and tripped over something. The hands let go as I fell on the dusty glass floor. When I fell, my light shined on a nearby staircase going up. I held my phone in my mouth and quickly crabbed to it. Shards of glass pierced my hands. I kept my eyes focused on the staircase never looking over my shoulders.

I got to the metal staircase and scrambled up.

I entered a crumbling brick and wood labyrinth, connecting rooms and corridors entangled with dirt and debris. It was musty and murky. The best way to describe it – it looked like the place had been bombed and was barely holding together. At any time, the wood ceiling could break and collapse in on itself crushing everything below. Walls were crumbling apart. Windows were filled with dirt. Doorways seemed to hold the place together.

I mad dashed through different rooms. Some were full of dirt and debris. Soom were filled with remnants from a past time. The bones of metal beds and vanities were strewn about. 

I entered an empty brick room and recognized the new chain link fence and board blocking out what was behind it. 

It was the garage’s barrier fence!

I ran to it, looking for a weak link.

Suddenly, I became incredibly cold. My body violently shivered, I felt like I was going to throw up, and that wretched vibe put me on my knees.

I turned to see what was behind me. It was not one but five human silhouettes. Their features were obscured. Yet their distorted shapes stood out. They had longer limbs and necks. Hunched backs. Bones bending abnormally. Hair matted. Tattered clothes. One wore what I believe was a bowler style hat. They stood there seemingly watching me even though I never saw their eyes.
 
I suddenly felt like I was choking. I knew I didn’t have long and somehow, I was able to squeeze more adrenaline out of myself. I moved to the fence and used all my weight and power to pull on it. Nothing would give as I went down the fence, tugging it for any weakness. 

I looked over my shoulder and the shadow things were lumbering towards me. 

I pulled harder and faster. None of the fence would give.

I could feel them right behind me like a strong fire scorching me. I could barely breathe. I was becoming light-headed. Things blurred as I kept pulling harder and faster down the fence trying to find –

The weak spot that I had noticed from the other side. The fence gave some pull! I had found it! I then pulled harder, and it pulled looser.

Everything was blurry and that dark place seemed to be swirling around me. But I held onto the fence and used all my strength to yank harder and harder. It gave way more. Enough were I thought I could climb over it and into the garage.

I began to climb but their hands snatched me and dragged me back. 

Their touch burned. And each one seared me worse than the one before. I screamed, the pain propelling me to push harder. 

I clung to the fence and yanked myself as hard as I could. Blood spilled down my mouth because I bit my lip almost off as I grunted and strained. Their force was too brutal. My arms felt as if they would break off. My body would be torn in half. But I wouldn’t let go of the fence. 

I kicked my legs wildly and torqued my core with everything I had. Twisting like a wild wrecking ball. I felt that I broke through their clutches. I was depleted but my sheer panic, fear, dread, everything you could imagine gave me the burst of energy to plant my foot on the fence and fling myself over it. 

My face smacked hard on the concrete below. My head rang like a bell. But I was back in the garage. 

I wobbled to my feet. My head was spinning but I ran as fast as I could through the parking maze. I kept running as fast as I could and made it to an emergency exit.

I blasted out of the garage, ran across the street, and jogged maybe another ¼ mile away. 

I stopped as I had to throw up. I will never forget the smell and color of that vomit. It looked like I had eaten black rotten eggs and smelled like when restaurants empty their grease traps. It was so nasty.

And I nearly passed out in it.

I didn’t know if they would follow me, so I went straight to the hospital and sat in the Emergency Room all night. My burns were borderline severe. But you couldn’t tell what they were really from. The hospital didn’t seem to care about them and was more worried if I had Covid.

The next day, I called the police. They didn’t find anything and refused to go down into the depths that I went. There were no signs of anything in the ventilation room. From the look of my bruises, the police thought I must have been jumped by a transient and fallen on a hot pipe and was probably concussed and possibly seeing things. They also said they didn’t have the time nor resources to investigate the matter further.

Later that day, I quit.

It’s been years now since that encounter. That place will always haunt me and has really f’d me up. I’ve seen a few therapists who never seem to believe me. I have nightmares all the time. During a lot of them I see the child whose voice I heard down there.

He kind of looks like my cousin. And he’s always asking for my help to save him. 

Is he trying to still communicate with me? Was he a trick to get me in there or was he really trapped? 

I’m going to go back down there to save him… I’ve hired some paranormal investigators to help me… I think that’s crazy… I think I’m out of my mind… 

But at least I’m not a coward anymore.
