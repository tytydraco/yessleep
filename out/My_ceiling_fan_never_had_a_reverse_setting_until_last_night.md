It’s 3:43 AM. I haven’t slept. I don’t think I can anymore. I’ve been living alone in this apartment for over three years now, and nothing strange has ever happened—until last night.

To get the context straight: I live in an old building. The kind that still has wooden window panes, creaky pipes, and ceiling fans with those big brown blades. I’ve always liked the hum of the fan—it’s oddly comforting. You know, that soft *whirr* that blends with the silence of the night? That’s why I keep it running year-round.

Now here’s the thing: my fan only ever spun in one direction—clockwise. That’s just how it’s wired. There’s no reverse setting. No switch. No remote. Just one wall regulator knob. And it’s been that way for *years*.

So when I woke up last night at around 2:15 AM because of this odd cold air hitting my face—like a concentrated stream of wind—I thought maybe the weather had shifted suddenly. But when I opened my eyes, the fan… was spinning counterclockwise. Slowly. Quietly. *Too* quietly.

At first, I chalked it up to a weird dream. Maybe I’d slept weirdly and was imagining things. I even got up, stood on the bed, and stared at the fan just to be sure. I flipped the switch off. The fan slowed to a stop. Then I turned it back on.

It started spinning clockwise again. Like normal.

I laughed it off, went to pee, drank some water, and lay back down. Maybe five minutes passed. Just as I started to doze off, I heard something. *Click.* Like a light switch. But softer. More deliberate.

I opened my eyes.

The fan was spinning counterclockwise again.

But this time, it wasn’t slow.

It was fast. And silent.

Too silent. The usual hum, the buzz of electricity… it was just gone. It felt like someone had muted it. And the breeze wasn’t cool anymore—it was icy cold. Not air-conditioned cold. *Grave cold.*

I sat up. I was fully awake now, heart pounding. I grabbed my phone to record it, but as soon as I lifted the camera, the fan *stopped*—dead still. No slowing down. Just *stopped.*

Then I heard footsteps.

Above me.

I live on the top floor.

I don’t mean the sound of rats or pipes or old wood creaking. I mean full-on, *measured footsteps*. Pacing directly above my bed. Slow. Heel to toe. Back and forth.

Then they stopped.

And something *knocked*—*from inside the ceiling.*

I ran. I straight-up grabbed my keys, phone, and wallet and bolted. Slept in the stairwell for the rest of the night like an idiot. My neighbors probably think I’m on drugs.

This morning, I checked the fan again. It’s working like normal. Clockwise. Buzzing like usual. The regulator’s untouched. I even opened the switchboard—no sign of tampering or rewiring. I climbed up with a ladder and knocked on the ceiling. It’s solid concrete. No crawlspace. Nothing.

I called my landlord. He said no one has access to the rooftop. It's locked, and he hasn’t given the key to anyone in years.

But just now—literally ten minutes ago—I came back from the store, and my bedroom felt... different. Cold again. Not the temperature, but like the *air* was heavier.

And on the bed?

One of the fan blades. Just one. Lying flat across my pillow like someone had gently placed it there.

The rest of the fan is still intact. No loose bolts. No cracks. Just… missing a blade.

I’m not sleeping here tonight. Or ever again. But before I leave, I need to know—has anyone else seen their fan reverse *on its own*?

And if so… did anything *come down* when it did?

I wasn’t planning to come back. After finding that fan blade on my pillow, I packed a bag and left. I stayed at a friend’s place—didn’t tell them the full story, just that I was dealing with “wiring issues.” I didn’t want to sound insane.

But curiosity is a disease. And it got me.

This morning, around 11 AM, I went back. Daylight made it easier to pretend everything had a rational explanation. Maybe the blade came loose. Maybe my memory was playing tricks on me. Maybe I was sleepwalking and knocked it down myself.

The apartment felt normal. Too normal. Like someone had aired it out, fluffed the pillows, and removed the weight in the air. I half-laughed at myself and opened the bedroom door.

The fan was whole again.

All four blades. Spinning clockwise. Buzzing like always.

The one I saw on the pillow was gone. I searched everywhere—under the bed, in the closet, even in the bathroom. Nothing. That’s when I started to feel that cold again—not freezing, just... dense. Like the kind of cold that settles in your bones without warning.

I should’ve left. I know that. But instead, I stood directly under the fan and stared at it. It was spinning lazily. Clockwise. Innocent.

Then I heard it again.

*Click.*

Just once.

And the fan stopped.

This time, it didn’t reverse. It didn’t move at all. But the regulator knob on the wall? It started turning on its own. Slowly. *Deliberately.* Back and forth.

I stepped back.

And then the lights went out.

Not just flickered—completely blacked out. Middle of the day, but the curtains were closed, and I suddenly couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead. I reached for my phone and turned on the flashlight.

That’s when I saw the footprints.

Not shoeprints. Bare feet. Dusty. Human. But *wrong*. The toes were too long, almost claw-like. They started near the foot of my bed and led to the wall… where they stopped.

And above them?

Faint scratch marks. Four parallel lines, about the width of a hand, gouged vertically into the paint. Like someone—or *something*—had climbed up the wall.

I swear to you, as I stood there frozen, the ceiling fan let out a single, mechanical *groan*. It wasn’t spinning. It wasn’t moving. But it made a sound—like it was grinding its teeth.

That was enough.

I ran.

I didn’t even take my bag. Just locked the door from the outside and left.

I called an electrician an hour ago, told him I needed the entire ceiling fixture removed. He just called me back.

Here’s what he said:

>

I never asked for that. I never *did* that. No one has access. I live alone.

I asked him if he removed the fan.

He said no. When he reached to unscrew the blades, **he heard whispering**.

Right above him. Clear, slow, unintelligible.

He left without touching it.

I think… I think it doesn’t want to be removed.

I’m staying in a hotel tonight. But something’s bothering me.

When I was walking out of the building, one of my neighbors—an old lady on the second floor—called out to me.

She said:

>

I shook my head.

She frowned.

>

There’s no floor above mine.

And yet… someone’s crawling.
