I recall a point in my life when I felt I could make it through it without discipline. For sure, life was chaos, yet it would always seem pretty manageable until it wasn't. This is the story of how my lack of discipline slowly unraveled my life piece by piece until I woke up in the nightmare that I created for myself.  
  
It started small. I was a reasonably productive person, but I had absolutely no structure. Distractions ruled my day: endless social media scrolling, binge-watching shows, and late nights for no good reason at all. Every morning, I promised myself that tomorrow would finally be different, that I'd get a handle on things. But tomorrow never changed. One vicious circle of procrastination and broken promises to myself led another.  
  
Before long, my assignments started piling up. Deadlines I had previously thought I could push kept getting closer. I managed to convince myself that I worked best under pressure, but the reality was far darker. I wasn't working well at all. I started missing deadlines and making mistakes; my performance was suffering. Clients dropped me one after the other, and I found myself unable to fulfill my financial obligations. Then the panic would set in, and yet I couldn't seem to bring myself to fix it. Every day, I'd promise myself I'd do better, every night lying in bed staring at the ceiling, knowing I hadn't.  
  
I began to experience a ripple effect in other aspects of my life, too. I let myself go. My room was the reflection of my inner chaos: clothes scattered on the floor, piled-up unwashed dishes, and dust everywhere. The more everything around me rotted, the more impossible it became to stand up to my responsibilities. Then my relationships started to go downhill. I cancelled my friends, lied for excuses, and became a recluse. Each time one of them asked me how I was, I put on a brave face, though inside, I felt drowned in a sea of my own failure.  
  
The worst wasn't the immediate damage, but rather a gradual loss of control in creeping fashion. My mental health undertook a sharp downwards spiral. Anxiety firmly clutched me, and depression started clouding each corner of my mind.  
  
I couldn't sleep, mired in the guilt of chances lost, with this gnawing sense that somehow I was to blame. Reality slipped further and further away, but I was too exhausted to try and grab hold of it.  
  
It wasn't just mental; my physical health started to deteriorate, too. I stopped going to the gym, eating junk food because cooking seemed too much work, and barely leaving the house. Those rare times when I did, it felt like the world was spinning around me, going too fast for me to catch up with. And I knew I spiralled, but I just could not get myself out of it-too far gone, trapped by my own inertia.  
  
It came tumbling down all in one night: I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding, gasping for air. I looked around my room, which had become a tomb of missed chances, and realized just how far I'd fallen. I couldn't recognize the person I'd become-a stranger amidst the ruins of my own life. It felt like being buried alive under the weight of everything neglected.  
  
That's when it hit me: it wasn't the suddenness of my fall that was horrific; it had happened so quietly. What was really terrifying was that I had let it happen. The disease of indiscipline, something which I had blown off, which I told myself wasn't important, had seeped into all areas of my life and poisoned it from within. And here I was, shut up in a prison which I had built. It's about maintaining the structures of your life, not about productivity. Without that, everything falls to pieces. I know that one from experience. Now I try to climb my way from the edge, but it was already too late. That life I knew was gone and replaced by the ruins in a nightmare built with my hands. Let me make something very clear: discipline is not optional; it's the thin line holding together your life, keeping chaos at bay. Do not let that [slip](https://futures-newsletter-c71c06.beehiiv.com/subscribe).
