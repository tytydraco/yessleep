Someone please come and help me.  
  
Five hours ago I was preparing lunch in the kitchen. In the middle of it I started to notice a sound. In the background some distant thumps reverberating through the walls. Now obviously since I live in an apartment block its expected that I hear sometimes people walking up and down the hallway sometimes especially when they are stepping heavy. But these this sound sounded so consistent so I eventually walked right up to my apartment door to listen closely. And the thumps were not fading. At all. They didn't go up or down or anywhere they were coming from someone just I think someone standing still and stepping really really loud.  
  
I stood behind that \[VULGAR\] door for something like 10 minutes. The thumps didn't stop. Never changed in volume either or. I can't hear anything else it's just the thumps. The person isn't saying anything. They feel so loud now. All I hear is the beat of the footsteps behind my door.  
  
To say I am terrified would be a \[VULGAR\] understatement. I do not for the life of me know what kind of maniac is behind my door but I will not be I will not open that thing for my life. Where the \[VULGAR\] are my neighbours do they not hear this. I thought this was a nice place to live. I spent two months settling in here and now this \[VULGAR\] has me scared so much I am shaking my hands are shaking I couldn't even type on the keyboard so I am using this phone voice recorder that is turning what I am saying into the text.   
  
I have a window to outside but I live three stories up so I can't climb out there is no point. I don't want to scream cause maybe it will probably hear. I am trying really trying very hard not to cry right now. I am holding in my sniffles. Even afraid to turn my back to the door. Because I feel it will jump at me the moment I look away I don't know how it could I just feel so.  
  
\[VULGAR\]  
  
I tried the police but when they picked up I said there was footsteps they asked me why I was whispering and well I don't know I think they think I was doing a prank cause they hanged up and. I tried calling my mom but she still doesn't pick up please help I have no one else.  
  
The lunch is ruined now the pasta was boiled too soft but I just turned the stove off and am. Sitting in the living room in the corner now. I am asking begging for anyone near Tudorville Plaza or Redwick Square please come to 15 Malcolm Road my window is. From the front outside the building it is third from bottom and second on the left. Yes left. Please come I will wave to you I have not seen anyone so far. Nobody is outside.  
  
I want to get out of this place. The thumps they have kept this rhythm for so long. I feel my heart also beating really loud. I try to breathe to relax but the noise beating in my ears is just just too much. I'm going to go to the other room to get my earbuds so maybe I can listen to some music to calm myself. Only in one ear though. I have to be able to listen to the thumps. Maybe they will stop. I do not know if that will be good or bad but if they stop I need to know.  
  
Please hurry someone I think the I think the
