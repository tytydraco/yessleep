I will never go back to Stowe, Vermont. The truth had revealed itself and showed me how greed and love can taint even the purest of souls. I plan on forgetting all of the events, yet assume that I never will. Putting it online won’t help that fact either, yet I wrote these documents so I could appease the conflict that appeared in my mind and in the real world. I just wish that it never did happen to me, my father, my mother, and everyone else who was in that town. I doubt they’ll be there for long though, at least once they find all of the twisted and mangled bodies that lie only a couple hundred feet from their quiet town.

Kensie had led the way as Riley and I followed behind her. We mainly kept silent until I broke the silence by asking “So what do you usually do around here?”

“Well I work with Kensie, I also play guitar but haven’t really found anyone to start a band with so I mainly just play it to have some fun. Other than that, I just sit at home and play games. And what do you do?”

“I went to college for a bit and when I got out I came here. Then that led to us hiking in my backyard.” 

“What was at college,” Kensie chimed in from ahead of us. “Do you go to all of those supposed college dorm parties?”

“I mean, not really. If I did then they were all pretty lame with just a bunch of other English kids talking about different online topics that they had just learned about.”

“So English was your strong suit,” Riley asked. “What’s the plan with that degree?”

I felt a little too embarrassed to say anything about my writing, so I just thought of something else that quickly came to mind as my backup option. “I plan on being a teacher.”

“Damn,” Kensie said as she waited for us to catch up with her. “Did our childhood teach you nothing? We were dicks to Mrs. Maddison. She still loves her too.” Mrs. Maddison was our old math teacher who always seemed like the person who never liked her job in the first place. I mainly imagine that was because of us though. We pulled all of the ‘classic’ jokes that they showed in movies. Thumbtacks on the chair, glue on the chair, mouse traps under her desk. Thinking back I started to wonder if we were really the golden children that our parents thought we were.

“That lady’s got a serious problem nowadays,” Riley laughed as he looked up through the pine trees. “Whenever she comes in, she usually asks to have any other waiter besides Kensie.”

We all laughed as we continued our way through the forest. All of this reminded me of being a kid once again, letting all of the troubles of the world seem to dissipate as the wooden walls of the forest enclose around me. What I wouldn’t give to be back there. 

“What’s so funny,” A small voice said as I heard twigs begin to snap. I looked behind all of us to find the voice and saw two rabbit ears disappearing behind a large tree. I signaled Riley and Kensie to stay close and to not engage with it.

“What about me?” I looked to my left and saw another child that adorned an orange fox mask. Seeing the mask in the daylight had made me realize how creepy they actually were. The mask was covered with orange fur that looked like it was peeling off and turning white. I imagine that the fur was just painted and glued onto the face. The child’s clothes seemed to be what any regular kid would wear, blue jeans and a random t-shirt. This particular child was wearing a plain green shirt. 

“Can’t you tell us? We promise we can show you the way.” I looked back to my right and saw that the bunny child was now in full view. They seemed to be a girl who was no older than eight. 

“Can you show us the way? Where would you take us?” My question seemed to offset Riley, but if they could really show us where to go, then I had to take it.

“To the theater,” the fox child exclaimed as he hopped out onto the trail. “I’m surprised you don’t remember where it is Jason.”

Kensie and Riley both looked at me but I didn’t acknowledge them. I was only focused on the two children in front of us. “Take us to the theater.”

The two children joined together and pushed their way through us. We all just watched them walk for a little until I took a step forward. I could hear Kensie ask Riley about something but he didn’t seem to have an answer. 

Kensie walked up beside me and placed a hand on my shoulder. “What were they talking about Jason?”

“I don’t know. I’m just assuming that they don’t want to kill us right now.”

She stayed silent for a while until she asked “Do you know them?” 

“No.” I didn’t want to lie, but at the same time I really didn’t know who they were. If I told them about what happened all those years ago, then they may try to go back. “If they know me it’s because of the time I spent with my parents. We just have to trust them for now until we find out what they want.”

Riley was now beside me and stayed silent the whole time. Kensie joined him in the silence as all I could hear now were birds chirping and the wind that ran past my ears. I started to remember all of the time that I stayed here, walking and running through trees and different kinds of plants. It felt like heaven when I was in these woods. I used to just lay down on the trail, staring at the sky that would turn a beautiful orange in the afternoons. 

“I wish I could live here,” A girl who was about eight said as she lay next to me. I don’t remember a little girl, but at that moment a part of my past had been revealed. I rolled onto my side and looked at her. Brown hair had covered the sides of her face as she stared up at the sky. 

“Me too,” I said aloud. Kensie and Riley stared at me confused. “Sorry. I was thinking about something.”

“Can you guys run,” one of the children ahead of us asked. We all nodded and before we could do anything else, they were running deep into the woods. I was the first one to run after them, thinking of the time I spent here once more. All of the memories and nostalgia felt like it was flooding back. 

I was then transported into another memory. I was running through the forest dodging all of the trees and weaving past them. Something had knocked me down. I began to laugh as the same girl from before was beside me laughing as well. “I think I got you that time,” she said as she tried to catch her breath. 

“I’ll win one of these days,” I said as I sat up. “I’ve gotten a lot faster. These shoes help me.” I picked up my foot and showed my Sketchers to the girl who stood up as well.

“I wish I could live here.” The same statement that she used to repeat every day.

“Me too,” I said as I came back to consciousness. I could see that the kids in front of us now stopped and were waiting, they’re masks now being concealed by the shades of the pines that lie above us. 

I slowed down and stopped until I was about five feet in front of them. The others caught in about ten seconds and we all waited for them to say something. “We’re here,” The fox child said.

“How,” Riley said as he knelt over catching his breath. “We literally just stopped here because of you guys.” The bunny child walked away from us as he turned to his right and walked forward. We all followed her and we all saw the theater. It had three concrete rows that were only placed in front of the stage which was made of wood with old curtains that had holes covering them. 

“Holy shit,” Kensie said as we walked closer to the stage. I could see two kids hiding behind the curtains, peeking through the holes. “What are they doing back there?”

“They’re getting ready for the show tonight,” The fox child said as he jumped onto the stage. “The storyteller’s got a good one for us. It’s about you, Jason.” I froze thinking about what they could display that I couldn’t remember. How had we all ended up here?

“Can he still be trusted,” One of the children behind the curtains asked. I could hear some other child say something to the one who had asked the question. Not being able to see them only made me feel more scared of what they were hiding.

Riley leaned in next to me and whispered, “What do they mean when they say it’s about you?”

“I don’t have any idea Riley.” I felt so bad for telling them the truth about my past with these kids, yet I still needed them here. I couldn’t do this by myself.

“You can all go back home now,” The bunny child said as she also leapt onto the stage. “We still need to practice our show. Come back around eight and bring some snacks. I really want some candy if you could bring some please.” She proceeded to walk away with her back turned to us before she turned around. She stared directly at Riley this time. “Someone else will be here for you.”

“Who,” Riley tried to ask, but she was already gone. 

“What do we do?” I didn’t know how to answer Kenise. Everything had happened so fast and I was still so confused about the visions that I was seeing. I wanted to know who that little girl was, I wanted to know why these kids were still so obsessed with me after all of these years, and I wanted to know who or what the hell the Storyteller was. 

“I think we need to go back,” I said as I stared at the two of them. They seemed confused.

“Why,” Kensie started as she sat down on the concrete seat. “I think we should stay and try to find out who the Storyteller is. I don’t care how long it takes, whatever or whoever that thing is it’s controlling these kids. How do we just leave these kids here again with that thing.”

“I know we need to find out every detail, but we seem to be on their good side right now. Let’s just go back home so we can think of some different ideas of what they are.”

“That’s bullshit, Jason,” Riley said as he threw his hands up. “We can just go down the trail a bit more and then sneak back. We have to find out about the Storyteller. We have to find out about my-” He didn’t finish his sentence as tears began to flow down his cheeks. Kensie hugged him as she stared at me, acting like it was my fault. Was it my fault? Was I the person who was making this mystery go on for too long? None of this should be my fault. I am not the scapegoat that would take all the blame. I am not the one who knows everything about these children. I knew practically just as much as these two did.

“No,” I said. “We have to go back, otherwise we’ll get nowhere. They’ll just get more angry and try to-” Before I could finish, I felt something hard hit my stomach. I fell to the ground as I tried to breathe. 

“Before what Jason! Before they try to kill us like they killed my brother!” I felt like I could feel the rage radiate off of Riley. I could barely hear Kenise saying something, but my wheezing was too loud and overpowered Kensie’s words.

I slowly got up as I caught my breath. “I don’t care if the Storyteller comes in thirty minutes. We need to go back home, and I won’t be the one responsible for your deaths.” I then threw my right arm into Riley’s stomach as he fell over. He hit the ground with a large thud as he began to wheeze just as I had.

“Jesus Jason,” Kensie exclaimed as she knelt next to Riley. “You guys aren’t solving anything by punching each other.”

“We are going back home,” I said as I began to walk away from them. I wanted to find out how Markus died just as much as his own brother did, but I knew that if we stayed then we would be dead soon. 

I then felt dizzy, feeling like I needed to puke. I fell to the ground and felt my eyes begin to go dark. Just before I had passed out, I saw a figure in the woods. Something silver showed on their chest and long grass blades covered their face, and then everything went dark.

“Wake up Jason,” a girl’s voice called out. “We have to go to the theater. The other kids are waiting for us.” I woke up and saw a white roof that hung above me. I looked around and saw something outside of my window. I got out of my bed and saw Abby. She was standing by the window with a large grin plastered across her face.

“”Let me go tell my mom and dad,” I said as I turned away from her. 

“There’s no time Jason. We have to go.”

“Fine,” I said as I put my shoes on and opened my window. She moved out of the way as I jumped down. She started to run first as I ran after her. How had I forgotten about Abby?

It took about ten minutes before we eventually made it to the theater. Four other children awaited us as we ran onto the stage. They all looked about the same age as us. They all had the same animal masks on.

“Where are your masks,” One child with an owl mask asked.

“Sorry,” Abby said as she sat down trying to catch her breath. “Jason slept for too long. We had to leave them at home.”

“We don’t just forget masks,” the bear masked child said with anger being present in his voice.

“You have to go back home before the Storyteller gets back.” The fox masked child looked just the same as the one in the woods from today.

“Okay,” I said as I picked Abby up. “We’ll run back home and grab the masks and then you guys can stall for us.” 

“Abby, Jason,” A voice came from behind the curtains which had no holes in them. The person stepped out from behind the curtains as the Storyteller sat down. “Why aren’t your masks on?” It almost felt like a statement more than a question.

“Sorry dad,” Abby said as she sat back down. “I went to go get Jason cause he slept in way too much. I’m sorry.”

I felt so nervous that my stomach began to hurt. I wanted to run away. I wanted to go as far as I could, but at the same time I wouldn’t have any friends if I did leave. “You’re fine for today, but if you keep forgetting then we won’t be able to have any fun with our games.” He reached under his shirt and grabbed something whatever was hanging from his neck. He never took it out though.

“Who are we going to play with today,” the fox child asked excitedly. 

“You're going to play with Storyteller Keppler today.” I remember I always thought of that name being strange.

“So does that mean Storyteller Pike will lead us there today.” Abby almost jumped up with excitement. She always liked Pike the most for some strange reason.

“Yep. She’ll take you all down towards the mountain. Now hurry and go down the path and try to find her. She said she wanted to play hide and seek with you all.” We all stood up and everyone else started to run away. I felt a hand touch my shoulder as I looked up at the Storyteller. “What seems to be your strife today, Jason?”

“What does that word mean?”

“It basically means, what troubles you today.”

“Oh. Well I just felt really bad that Abby and I forgot about our masks today. Everyone else seemed to not be happy about it.”

“They aren’t mad Jason. I bet that they may have their own strife today. You know what alway makes me feel better.” I looked up at him and shook my head. “I like to think of new stories to create and tell you all. The whole reason all of us Storytellers picked you six is because we wanted you all to have a great day almost everyday.”

“I guess you're right,” I said as I looked back down towards my feet.

“So what story are you thinking of Jason? I know you always have a good story.”

I tried to think for a little bit until I settled on one that I wrote in my journal so long ago. “What about the story of the plum and peach? I really like that one.”

“What’s it about Jason?” He sat down and asked me to do the same. 

“Well, one day a plum was put right next to a peach. The plum was already sad and the peach asked ‘what’s wrong’. The plum said ‘I don’t think anyone will eat me’. The peach was confused and said ‘why’s that. I bet plenty of people would want to eat you’. ‘People eat you because of how good you taste. People don’t really eat me because of my sour skin’. The peach then said ‘just because your outside is sour, doesn’t mean your inside isn’t sweet.’ Then someone came over and ate the Plum.”

The Storyteller began to applaud. “Great job Jason. You really got a knack for those kinds of stories.”

I smiled and stood up. “I should probably run to the others, before they forget about me.” I waved goodbye to him as he pulled the silver necklace from under his hood. I ran past trees before I eventually stopped and saw the rest of the children standing together. “What are we waiting for?”

They all stayed silent except for Abby who grabbed my hand and pointed in front of them. “I don’t think Storyteller Pike is okay.” I looked to where she was pointing and saw a woman's body that was surrounded by a pool of something dark and red. Above her was a man with a stubble beard who looked at us, a wide smile being present on his face.

I woke up on the couch that was in my living room. I could feel my head begin to pulse with pain. I slowly looked around and saw Kensie and Riley sleeping on the other couch that was sitting next to the window. “What happened out there Jason?” I looked for the voice and saw my father who was standing in the kitchen. 

“I-I,” I didn’t really know if I should tell him, but I knew that he wouldn’t give up if I never told him. “We went out to find the kids. They took us to a place called the theater.”

“So then why were you passed out in the woods?” I was surprised that he knew but I just assumed that Kensie or Riley told him about what happened. 

“I, I don’t know. I just felt sick and then I passed out. I think I started to remember a little bit of what happened before though.”

“What did you remember,” he said as he walked over. He sat down next to me as I lifted my legs and sat up. “You need to tell me everything.”

“I remember a little girl who was eight. I was the same age as her and we were running in the woods. We went to the theater, met up with all of those other masked kids, and then got ready to go meet up with someone to play games. Then-”

“Who was the little girl Jason?” He almost seemed to know who it was, yet he still wanted confirmation on his inquiry. 

“Her name was Abby. I don’t remember her last name though. Her father was the Storyteller.”

He rubbed his eyes and then looked back at me. His eyes seemed full of pain and confusion. “What the hell is the Storyteller?”

“There’s multiple of them. They basically tell the children what to do.” I hated this conversation. I wanted to leave immediately and go back to Washington. Why shouldn’t I?

“Jesus,” He said as he stood back up. He started to pace around the kitchen. “Why didn’t you ever tell me about any of this when you were younger?” I started to remember Pike’s body. The blood that continually pooled around her and the person who stood over her.

“Do you know anyone named Pike?” He looked at me once again, though I didn’t dare make eye contact with him.

“Pike. Pike was a woman who went missing when you were younger. That was one reason we tried to keep you away from the woods. She was only twenty seven when she was gone. Was she one of the Storytellers?” Twenty seven and dead. She never went missing, and I may be the only one who knows what really happened to her. 

“I saw something a while back of her going missing. I remembered it.” I don’t know how many times I had lied to the people that were so close to me, but it started to feel natural.

“What else do you remember?”

“I told a story to the main Storyteller. There’s three of them. I stayed a little behind while all of the other kids were playing games, then I ran for them. When I finally caught up with them, there was a man who was standing over some girl's body.”

He started to pace around once more. “Is there anything else you remember? Anything at all?”

“No. I can’t. I think we need to go back tonight.” 

“No,” He said firmly. “We are going to pack everything up tonight and then leave in the morning. We aren’t going to stay here any longer. I should have done this years ago.”

“You can’t dad. We have to find out what happened. We have to-”

“We have to move away Jason,” He yelled as Riley and Kensie woke up. “I tried everything to protect you and your mother back then. Now I have to again and this will be the last time.”

I stood up, wondering if I should really protest against him. “You can leave with mom, but I am staying here and finding out what is going on.” Kensie began to stand up but Riley pulled her back down, likely knowing that she shouldn’t interfere. 

He let out a sigh and then walked over to the counter where he reached into a drawer and pulled out his revolver, the same one he pulled out during the morning. “I don’t want to do this, but I need all of you to leave this house. No one is staying here anymore.”

“Holy fuck,” Riley cried as I saw him wave his hands in the air. Kensie was so shocked that she just stared with her mouth agape.

“Put the gun down dad,” I said as I began to take a tiny step forward. I saw him look down though so I put my foot in its original place.

“I just want us all to be safe. Please just get back into the car with me and we can go drive away from this Godless house.”

I could feel anger start to boil inside of me. “Safe. Safe isn’t pointing a gun at your child. Safe isn’t holding three people hostage. Safe isn’t trying to keep us from the truth.” With each sentence I took one step closer to my father.

“Jason, back up.” He now lifted the gun so It was facing my head.

“Safe isn’t when your father almost gets you kidnapped because he was fast asleep.”

“Jason, please just-” He started to back away from me now.

“Safe isn’t when you let your son go out into the woods by himself every single afternoon.”

“Jason, I-” He was now against the counter.

“Safe isn’t when you still led him into those same woods that he almost got taken to all of those years ago.”

“Back up Jason.” He began to lower the gun.

“Safe is when you and your wife actually keep your son away from those woods. Safe is when you move to a new town and never come back. Safe is when-” Then I heard it. It sounded like something had fallen, no, something had shattered. A sharp ringing, and then a sharp pain. I could hear Kensie scream from behind me as footsteps approached the two of us swiftly. My father kept looking down, and then looked into my eyes. He was crying. 

I fell to the floor as I held my foot. I could feel where the hole was now. I looked back up and Riley started to wrestle the gun out of my fathers hand. They kept moving from side to side, continually shouting something to each other, before Riley ripped the revolver out of his hands and pointed it at my fathers temple. Kensie was now standing next to Riley, crying and pleading with him to set the gun down. Riley nodded to me and Kensie came over to pick me up.

As she lifted me, the pain in my foot felt as if it was shifting to the rest of my body. Riley still held the gun to my father and then looked back at us. “Riley, we need to go,” Kensie said as she brought me over to the backdoor. She slid open the door as I could feel the cool night breeze wash over me.

“Jason,” I heard from behind me. I looked and saw my father on the floor crying. “I shot my own son.” He now looked back up to me. “Please forgive me Jason.”

Riley walked up beside us and then closed the door. “Should we get him to a hospital?”

“No,” I said as Kensie brought us closer to the forest. “We need to go find the children.”

“Help me out Riley,” Kensie said as she gestured to grab my other arm.

“God we’re really doing this,” He said as he lifted me up. The pain in my foot felt like it was continually growing. 

Part four will be the final part and I won't have to think about this anymore. Like I can think anymore. I am a husk of what and who I used to be. Just be happy that you never saw the children near Stowe Vermont.
