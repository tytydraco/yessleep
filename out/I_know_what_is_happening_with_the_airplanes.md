Have you seen the news recently? Well, I sure have, and… they don’t paint a good picture… Ever since Boeing started falling apart, it has gone downhill. Now, I don’t mean to defame them… more than they already have… but it’s just not them who are the problem, because it’s aircraft from every make that have crashed; and they are not crashing because of mechanical failure. 



Now, I know what you may be thinking, “Just who is this guy to have the nerve to talk about a serious and mysterious matter like a conspiracy theorist?” and, yes, I know that the AIG section of the ICAO is working tirelessly to find the causes of these crashes, the Jeju air collision with a wall and now a small plane crashing in Fullerton, California earlier today, but they won’t find anything. They’ll blame them on mechanical failures, a screw that wasn’t held properly, no maintenance from an airline… so on and so forth, because there are so many things that can go wrong when on a flight that it’s easy to blame something that didn’t cause the accident, but certainly would have after a few flights. 



I know this, because I’m an aircraft mechanic at my country’s main airline and I like to fly many devices during my off time. For the former, I’m the senior mechanic stationed at the Capital’s airport, which is the main hangar where repairs are made for the Airline. For the latter, I like to fly ultralights, my own Cezzna, paraglide and skydive. 



As you can see, I like the air, it has become my life, after all, and I like to keep informed on the developments of mankind in aviation. It was during September of 2024 that I started to receive more and more aircraft with serious problems, the most common being cracks in the internal fuselage and wing structure. I am sure that I don’t need to tell you how dangerous that is. Our airline is called Regional Aeronautics, and it’s small compared to the airlines you may fly in. We operate a total of 20 planes on 8 routes, most aircraft are older Boeing 737s, 2 Airbus A320s which work as our fleet’s crown jewels and the one I loved the most, a single 1976 Handley Page Jetstream which was usually rented for private flights over short distances.



At first, I classified the incidents and damages as a product of our changing climate, since I read an investigation that stated that nowadays, there are more severe cases of invisible turbulence; the turbulence that you and I are used to, that can’t be spotted on radar or any of the other instruments and, therefore, can’t be avoided; than 50 years ago. It wasn’t until the end of November when I started to think it was something else.



By that point, we had to ground 9 aircraft, and I calculated that by New Years Eve, we wouldn’t be able to sustain any route reliably. They all had the same problem, structural damage. We even had to dismantle the whole upper part of the Jetstream’s fuselage, which ended up being too much for the old craft, and the airline decided to sell it as soon as they could, a miracle they didn’t decide to scrap it but it was relegated to the sidelines until we repaired the other, more important planes. 



I decided I would take the Jetstream and repair it after hours, which I guessed would have it flying by Christmas, and the airline surprisingly agreed that I stayed in the hangar after my shift was over… after stating that they weren’t going to pay me the overtime. 



December 20th came, and, as Christmas rush approached, we were pressured to have the airplanes in flying condition as soon as possible. The grounded aircraft count had risen to 12 and the last 3 really terrified me. The first one arrived with its lower-left wing looking like a cat had used it as a scratcher, 3 deep gashes tore from the border of attack nearly up to the engine. The second one was worse, with the same pattern of gashes, yet this time, near the nose of the plane. The damage had been significant, damaging expensive sensors and nearly causing the plane to lose runway and resulting in an accident. Similar to what happened recently in South Korea.



All of those, however, paled in comparison to what happened to the third plane. It was one of the Airbus’, It had departed from the Capital’s airport, heading to the neighbouring country’s capital. At 17H00, it took off and at 17H30, it sent a distress signal, it had lost its steering. It was 1 grueling hour before the aircraft managed to land safely at the Capital’s airport. When it arrived at the hangar, it was terrifying. If I had believed that the first plane was used as a scratcher for a cat, this had been one for a whole litter.



Aircraft are painted white from the factory, and over that, the airlines colour parts of them as they want, be it yellow, blue and red, like the Airline, or green, purple… pink even, yet underneath all of that, there is the natural silver and green of the aircraft. The third airplane had the fuselage’s paint torn to the exposed raw silver, it was like a gaping wound, and they were all over the place, small, large, elongated. I saw one that neatly went through the front of the aircraft to the back, splitting it into 2 halves. The wings and tail fared much worse, if the paint was an open wound, the scratches on the wing were down to the marrow. Critical components were damaged, wiring was cut and sometimes straight up missing. When we identified the problem that caused the loss of steering of the aircraft, it was a miracle nothing worse happened. A gash had cut through the hydraulic lines going to the wings on both sides, they had leaked themselves empty. 



Usually, the lines keep leaking for hours before running out, but these were dryer than the Sahara, and to say it bothered me was an understatement, especially after I found the gashes near the fuel lines. 



I was terrified, how could turbulence do so much damage to an aircraft… I accepted some structural damage, fissures on the wings and the internal structure were common during strong turbulence and so long as they were treated in a short time, they weren’t dangerous; yet gashes were new, and I just couldn’t wrap my head around how they could’ve formed. 



“Easy,” said one of my workmates when I raised the question to a group of them during lunch break on the 22nd, “It’s ‘em Aliens”



I raised an eyebrow at him, confused by his answer. I guess the others were intrigued too because the airport’s lunch hall felt eerily silent after that. After a few seconds of silence, my workmate continued.



“Y’know, ‘em ones spotted over the skies of New York and Chicago recently.” he then made a pause to sip from his juice, “‘ven the Pentagon don’t know wha’s the deal with ‘em”



I wasn’t sure if his answer was honest or he was just messing with me, so after he finished talking, I couldn’t think of anything to say to prevent the silence from falling uneasily over the lunch hall. 



“Now, I don’t know what BS you’re talking about, but you’re most certainly wrong” An overly nasal voice called from the table over, and we all turned to look at the owner of the voice. It was a mechanic for an international airline that had been in the Capital to scout for a possible hub in the continent. He was tall and very, very slim, I’m talking slenderman territory slim; He looked like the type of guy that could win a hide and seek contest by just turning to their side. He had short, brown hair, a white face with freckles and a pair of thick-rimmed glasses that made him look like he was going to raise his index finger, show some bunny teeth, say “acshually” and spill the most useless fact ever. I mean, he certainly had the voice… 



“We all know that Aliens do not exist” the guy proceeded, using his index finger to accommodate his rims that were perpetually sliding down his nose “And we all know that summer has gone for far too long now due to the El Niño phenomena”



The people in the lunch hall all nodded in agreement.



“So it’s actually just the wind from summer that warms the earth and creates severe turbulence that causes airplanes to break.” 



I nodded, I had noticed that, when I went paragliding, I often had to wake up at 4 a.m. to fly because it became just too turbulent and hard to steer after 6 a.m. that I had to deploy my parachute and intentionally fall to be able to land. But that didn’t explain all of the gashes and tears to the plane’s fuselage. However, the lunch hall had returned to their usual banter and conversations so I felt it sensible not to continue the topic. I figured that if I were to get any information on the topic, I’d be better off talking to one of the pilots that experienced the turbulence.



It was the evening of the 26th of december, my shift had ended a few hours ago and I was fixing the Jetstream. Due to the abnormal quantity of grounded aircraft, I hadn’t had the time to pay attention to the craft, so the repair date had been moved to the 31st, on par with the new year. The night crew had settled into work, some even helping me from time to time on the Jetstream as they took a break from the bigger aircraft and I was casually humming a melody that I had learnt from a veteran that practiced skydiving with me when the doors to the hangar opened and in came a person.



At first look, he seemed to be a high ranking Airline member. Maybe a manager? But when he came closer, I saw that he was a pilot. He was tall, with a neat haircut over his blonde hair, he had blue eyes and a clean shave. The newcomer wore a black pilot suit, decorated with the Airline’s logo, a bird with the colors of our flag, as well as medals, a tie and some aviator glasses in his breast pocket. He had matching black pants and formal, leather shoes. Under his arm, his cap was held firmly but elegantly. 



He walked through the entrance, looking at the work that was being done to the aircraft. Fortunately, no other airplanes had joined us since the Airbus. I had been in the process of riveting the second-to-last panel to the fuselage, my handiwork making me proud, when he stopped and admired my progress.



“Nice job man, this one’s looking as good as new” he chuckled, looking at the unfinished part. “You sure working hard on this one”



I smiled.



“Yeah, I want to have it airborne ready by New Year’s” I said, happy that someone acknowledged my work, “Though the damage is quite disconcerting, because no turbulence could damage the fuselage like this… Or that”



I said, pointing to the Airbus behind me. When he looked towards the plane, the pilot audibly flinched. 



“Ho-ly” he said, whistling “I didn’t feel like it was THAT bad”



“You the pilot?” I asked, internally begging for a ‘yes’. 



“In the flesh,” he said, pointing at himself; “Had to stop for a visit, figured I would assess the damage and try to see what happened”



I perked from my work and looked at him, intrigued. 



“So…” I said, not knowing how to address the accident without sounding strange “What really happened?”



I didn’t receive a response for a few seconds, so I proceeded nervously



“Y’know… because that is most definitely not because of turbulence.”



“I agree,” came the thoughtful voice of the pilot, “I just… I don't know what really happened… it’s like I was… at one moment I was setting the autopilot and then the next I was struggling with the controls to keep airborne. They started to get tighter and stronger with every shake and rattle of the aircraft and then it started creaking.”



“I see” I said, not really understanding



“There’s just, something that I remember happened,” He said, “I remember telling myself that I had to report it once we landed, but I just can’t remember.” 



He remained silent after that, consumed in thought as he looked at the looming giant that was the Airbus. I resumed my job of riveting the panel and checking for leaks until he turned to leave.



“Well, I sure would like to see the finished progress on this old De Havilland” He said, extending a hand for me to shake. “Rowan”



“Josh” I took the hand



“Well then, Josh, see you on the 31st!” With that, he left the hangar briskly.



I finished earlier, on the 29th, so I planned the test flight and submitted it for approval by the airline. They weren’t thrilled that a non-pilot was to control their precious aircraft, but I managed to get their approval after presenting them my flying license and telling them that one pilot was going to go with me. It was then that I got clearance for January 2nd.



It took a while, but I eventually managed to contact Rowan, who was thrilled to co-pilot the test flight. On the day I was going to fly, I woke up, ate cereal with yoghurt… don’t judge, I forgot to buy milk and no one was open on the 1st… and headed to work. I was cleared to test when my shift was over, at 7 p.m., yet time passed so slowly that I felt like I was going to die of old age before I got to fly the Jetstream, and I was just 26! Eventually, my shift ended, and I excitedly clocked out and jumped into the cockpit of the aircraft. I pulled up a checklist of what I needed to do previous to the flight and radioed the tower. 



Rowan arrived a few minutes later, excusing himself because there was traffic. I said don’t worry, and, after we refueled, we started to head towards the runway that the control tower directed us to. The sky was starting to darken and I could barely see the outlines of the trees at the end of the runway.



“Ok,” said Rowan, “I’ve got here all the checklist ready. Where are we going?”



“We’re heading to an airfield on the other side of the mountains,” I explained, “There there is no turbulence, and it’s owned by an associate of the Airline” 



We were supposed to test the pressurization of the cabin, the fuselage’s integrity and engine feel. 



“Regional Aeronautics Flight 073-HM this is Air Traffic Control, do you copy? Over”



“Copy Regional Aeronautics 073-HM, Over”



“Regional Aeronautics Flight O73-HM, cleared for takeoff, wind is 20 knots northward path Charlie 6, fly well, Over”



We started the take-off procedure, engine throttle to maximum, the path to follow and took to the skies.



The flight was uneventful, we quickly rose to 15,000 feet, the perks of taking off at 9,500 ft, to clear the mountains and immediately descended on the airfield, while we refuelled, I checked the fuselage for any signs of damage, but there were none.



To say I was happy was the understatement of the new year, everything was going well, there was no turbulence expected because it was late in the night and usually, at night there isn’t a lot of wind.



When it became time to return, I had one last test to do, and that was the engine feel. The old Handley Page Jetstream usually suffered from engine problems as its propeller engines were getting tired of living. So it was imperative that during our regular checkups, we did the engine feel test. It consisted of rising to the service ceiling, 25,000 ft, and pushing the throttle to the maximum; if the plane couldn’t surpass the 215 knots airspeed, it became time to look for a replacement engine. 



“I am actually dreading this part,” Rowan said as we climbed from the airfield. “I had just reached cruise altitude when the turbulence began, and I don’t know if this bird can handle it.”



“It’s 9 at night, I’m sure there is basically no wind up there” I tried to calm him. “Besides, it’s just until we reach 215 knots, then we’ll start to land”



“I’m not sure about this” Rowan said, “You sure you have to do this?”



I pulled my right hand from the controls and raised my pinky finger at Rowan. 



“Promise” I said, “If not, I have to buy you donuts”



“Okay then…” Rowan said after a moment of deliberation, taking my pinky with his.



\*\*\*



“Air Traffic Control this is Regional Aeronautics 073-HM, Over” I said to the radio

“Regional Aeronautics Flight 073-HM this is ATC, Over” came the response over the grainy radio.



“Regional Aeronautics Flight 073-HM, we need to climb to 25,000 feet, are we cleared? Over” 



“Regional Aeronautics Flight 073-HM cleared to climb to 25,000 feet heading northwest, wind is 10 knots north, 25 knots north at 25,000 feet, no traffic, over”



As we continued to climb, the flight became more and more unstable. There were times where I had to yank the controls fast to keep in track, which was very strange for me. Eventually, we reached 25,000 feet, leveled out and slowly throttled up, feeling the twin Turbomeca Astazou engines purr to 40,000 rpm as the plane reached 227 knots. 



I prepared to land, pulling out the checklist and giving the landing section a look.



“ATC this is RA Flight 073-HM ready for landing, over” I said onto the radio speaker, hearing a voice on the other end say.



“RA Flight 073-HM this is ATC, cleared for landing Runway 2L, keep heading down Gamma 7 until 10,000 feet, wind is 18 knots northeast, no traffic, over”



We started to head down when, as we were passing the 20,000 feet mark, a strange turbulence started shaking the plane. It started slow, almost unnoticeable, but slowly picked up force up to the point where the plane was thrashing wildly from side to side and strange, ripping sounds could be heard from outside. 



The electronics started to fail, there were moments where we were in complete and utter darkness, not even the moon or the stars could illuminate the dark interior. 



Besides all the shaking, I could feel something else, it seemed like someone was walking over the fuselage, scraping with a key or shards of glass over the fuselage of the old plane. I looked to one side and saw nothing, I looked to the other and saw nothing either. I did notice Rowan had frozen up, I think he was remembering what happened to his plane, so I shook him and brought him back to his senses. 



The scraping continued, each time stronger and more frantic, we were now rapidly descending, we reached 16,000 feet.



“I’M GONNA NEED YOU TO HOLD THE CONTROLS FOR A SECOND!” I shouted at Rowan, struggling to make myself heard over the thrashing of the frame, “I THINK THAT SOMEONE IS OUTSIDE THE FUSELAGE, I NEED TO SEE”



“SOMEONE IS WHAT?!” Rowan asked, panic in his voice for a second before he looked to the front, took a deep breath and calmed himself. I turned my neck to the left side of the airplane, struggling to see what was happening. 



What I saw next has to be the most terrifying thing ever. At the back of the plane, was a red creature. It seemed to be bipedal, with massive wings, and it was trying to get in using… using a sword. Above him, creating the turbulence, was a horse, it too was red and had wings, and was galloping above the fuselage, sending powerful thrusts. 



“12,000 feet” Rowan said, his voice strained by the force of pulling up the yoke



The creature outside raised its sword, it glowed orange, like flames, and then it thrust it against the fuselage, making a deep hole and sucking all the air out of the pressurized cabin.



Immediately, oxygen masks came down, both Rowan and I put them on as there was one last ear splitting jarring sound and everything calmed down. The airplane stabilized again, the cabin was dark, as if all power had been cut; which mainly explained why the engines died down. It made it all the most terrifying when from behind the cockpit, a heavy foot and a dragging sound was heard.



I opened my eyes wide and turned to look at Rowan. Rowan had a look of pure terror, his eyebrows lifted up nearly to his hair, eyes wide and even though the oxygen mask was covering his face, he probably had his mouth closed with so much force that his lips were turning pale… Or maybe that was me, because I could certainly feel how my lips begged for circulation, but I couldn’t even dare to move. 



Rowan and I both gripped the yoke like it was going to save our lives. The landing gear wouldn’t even try to go down, so we were forced to make a choice. Do we land like this? Or do we go around and try to turn the engines on?



There was another sound of a footstep, this time much closer, and the screech that followed centered me squarely on option 1, however, I still tried to turn the engines on, to no avail. There wasn’t even power to the small battery. 



The third step was right next to the door and I dared not to look, instead focusing on the rapidly approaching runway. A sharp edge appeared at the corner of my vision, it was red, and surrounded by fire. I didn’t have to look back to see that it had broken into the Cockpit… but I did it anyways, the figure that was besides me tried to appear like it was one of the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse, war, judging by the T-shirt that it wore, but its features were so incredibly alien, that I doubted my sanity. 



As the flames around the creature’s sword flickered ominously, it grinned, revealing jagged, alien teeth that glinted like polished blades. “You think you can escape?” it hissed, its voice reverberating through the cockpit, not just heard but felt—deep in the bones. The air grew heavier, suffused with the coppery tang of blood, though neither Rowan nor I was wounded.



Rowan trembled, his knuckles white on the yoke, and muttered, “What... what do you want?”



The creature didn’t answer. Instead, it raised its hand, and the lights in the cockpit flickered and died. The dashboard sparked, the instruments freezing as the plane began an uncontrolled descent. The creature laughed, a sound that was neither loud nor soft, but filled every corner of my mind. I wanted to scream but couldn’t; my voice was stolen.



Outside the window, the stars vanished. One by one, massive, silent ships slid into view, their jagged silhouettes darker than the night, their lights forming incomprehensible patterns that seemed to move and twist. My heart raced as I realized: they weren’t forming patterns—they were spelling something. Words. A message. But the letters shifted before I could comprehend, searing into my brain.



The creature pointed its sword at Rowan, and his head snapped back violently. Blood dripped from his nose as he struggled to speak, his words slurring into incoherence. “Josh… get us down… get us…” His voice faded.



Then it turned to me. “Pilot, do you know what it feels like to be insignificant?” its voice was no longer in my ears but inside my skull, resonating like the scream of tortured metal. “You’ll understand soon enough.”



The plane shuddered violently. I reached for the controls, but my hands wouldn’t move. The creature chuckled, leaning close enough that I could feel the heat of its fiery presence. “You can’t save them. None of you can. This world will burn, and we’ll watch.”



The next moment, the windshield shattered inward, and the roar of rushing air drowned out everything. I felt the searing grip of the creature’s hand on my shoulder before the world exploded into light. The last thing I heard was its voice, whispering now, intimate and inescapable, “You’ll kneel, one way or another.”



Then, blackness.



\*\*\*



I awoke in a hospital, and I am receiving more and more notifications about airplane accidents, all with the same pattern: turbulence, shrapnel, uncontrollable descent, death. I know they caused it, I know HE caused it. They will attack from the skies, they own the skies now, and they will not hesitate to finish whatever creature crosses them. Tell me, when was the last time you saw a bird, when was the last time you heard that airplane travel was safe. Because I’m sure it’s not today.
