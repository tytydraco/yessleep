“*Screw you!*”

My voice seething with hatred, I shouted expletives at the priests who stood in front of me. As they held up their Crucifixes and said their prayers in Latin, I growled.

“Oh, *priests*,” I spat. “Take your crosses and your water and your God and *get out!*”

“It is the Father Who commands you,” Fr. Granger declared. “It is the Son Who commands you. It is the Holy Spirit Who commands you.”

“You’re *filth!*” I screamed as I struggled against my restraints. “Nothing more than *filthy dogs!*”

As Fr. Granger sprinkled me with Holy Water, I writhed in pain as the drops burned my flesh. He and his assistant priest continued the ritual with prayers in Latin. My movements caused my nightgown to slide up, which revealed my underwear.

“Take me,” I exclaimed with a thrust of my pelvis. “Take me! *Ravish me!*”

Fr. Granger sprinkled me with Holy Water again as he continued the ritual, placing a section of his violet stole on my neck as he whispered his prayers.

“What are you going to do?” I laughed. “Are you going to keep going until this sow rots and lies stinking in the earth?”

“Silence,” Fr. Granger exhorted. “By the Triune God, you are commanded to leave this body of His handmaid, Sister Eva!”

“*Sister Eva?*”

I awoke with a start.

My breaths were rapid. My heart was racing. Sweat beaded my forehead.

*If only it was just a dream. . . .*

“Sister Eva?”

I looked at the door to my cell, and I saw Sr. Isabella standing there. She stood in the doorway, partially obscured by the darkness of the hallway, and partially illuminated by the candle on my bedside table.

“May I come in?” Sr. Isabella asked.

“Yes,” I answered. “I apologize. I was asleep. Come in.”

Sr. Isabella entered my cell, closing the door behind her. She sat on the wooden chair at my bedside, and she gathered her hands together in her lap. When she sat down, I noticed her Rosary was not attached to her habit.

“How are you?” Sr. Isabella asked.

“I’m well enough.”

“Are you in any pain?”

With a soft smile, I answered, “It’s nothing I can’t handle.”

“Do you need anything?”

“No,” I answered. “Your company is enough.”

There was an awkward silence before I tried to start a new conversation.

“Would you like to pray the Rosary?” I asked.

“I apologize, Sister,” Sr. Isabella said. “I don’t have my beads with me.”

Her words took me back to the past.

I recalled the serenity of the chapel before I abruptly ripped the Rosary off of my habit, as if it was a venomous snake. The Sisters looked at me, confused, as I tilted my head backward, and I started lowering the Rosary into my mouth. When I began to choke, Reverend Mother Superior wrestled to take it from me, but I spat it out and threw it in her face.

“Take your *beads*,” I screamed. “And shove them up your. . . .”

“Sister Eva?”

I was brought back to the present moment.

Shaking my head, I said, “We will pray together another time.”

“Yes,” Sr. Isabella whispered. “Another time.”

She glanced down at her hands, and I saw they were covered in dirt.

“Have you been gardening?” I asked.

“Oh,” Sr. Isabella exclaimed. “Yes, I have. We miss you.”

As I looked back on working in that garden, I recalled one particular incident in which I was discovered there by Reverend Mother and the Sisters, having uprooted all of our plants—flowers, fruits, vegetables—my naked body covered in dirt and muck and mud. I had apparently taken off my habit and went into the garden like Eve of Paradise. *What happened?* Whatever did or did not happen to me, I began to manifest a drastic shift in behavior and personality.

Returning my attention to Sr. Isabella, I replied, “I miss all of my Sisters, too.”

“Would you like me to bring them to you?”

“No.”

“Why?”

“I believe it is best for us to be alone,” I answered. Sitting up in bed, I said, “For now.”

“I understand,” Sr. Isabella said.

“Do you remember Reverend Mother Anna’s favorite verse?”

“No, I don’t believe I do.”

“‘The heart is deceitful above all things,’” I recited. “When I was a novice, she told us, before we received the veil, ‘Do not always trust your heart, daughters, for it is deceitful above all things. Not all desires of the heart are good and holy. You must test everything.’”

I was taken back in time while reminiscing Reverend Mother Anna, who was witness to one particularly prodigious incident, which showed the diabolical truth of what was happening to me. It sends a shiver down my spine even to this day. I feel sick to my stomach whenever I think of it. Yet I must confront my past if I am ever to die and rest in peace.

Before Reverend Mother began her day by going to the chapel and preparing it for the celebration of Mass and then the recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours, I slipped into the chapel during the night, illuminated by dozens of votive candles, and I ransacked the sanctuary. I toppled the statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph, as well as shattered the stained glass windows, cutting myself in the process. I tore off the white altar cloth and smeared my blood on the uncovered marble, after which I took off my habit and lay on top of the altar, naked, in a state somewhere between asleep and awake.

Upon entering the chapel for Mass and seeing the scene in front of her, Reverend Mother ordered the Sisters out of the chapel until she was able to secure me. Kneeling on top of the altar, I watched in silence as Reverend Mother Anna approached me.

“*Evita*. . . .” Reverend Mother whispered.

She tried to grab ahold of my hands, but I wrestled with her, covering her in blood while shouting obscenities, and I slapped her hard in the face, which caused her to fall down the steps leading to the sanctuary. She looked up at me from the floor of the chapel, and I screamed, “*Screw you*, you *stupid* sow!”

I jumped off of the altar to attack her, but some of the Sisters had entered the chapel during our fight and managed to subdue me and rescue Reverend Mother. With my arms held down on each side by two of the Sisters, I raised my head heavenward and screamed, a guttural scream directly from the depths of Hell, and Reverend Mother realized she needed to get me professional help, in the form of an exorcism.

Closing my eyes softly, I shook my head, and I returned to the present moment with Sr. Isabella.

“Did you know she gave me an additional piece of advice after I received the veil?”

“What?”

“‘You must test everyone and everything to see if they are of God.’”

“. . . .*Evita*,” Sr. Isabella beamed. “I remember she used to call you ‘Evita.’”

There was a pause as I subtly smiled.

“How?” I asked. “You didn’t enter the convent until after Reverend Mother Anna passed away.”

“You told me,” Sr. Isabella answered.

“No, I didn’t,” I insisted. “I didn’t tell Sister Isabella any of this before.”

“What?”

“I know who you are.”

“Who am I?”

“What shall I call you? You have many names and titles,” I answered. “Accuser, adversary, enemy.”

The candle flickered as Sr. Isabella’s face shifted from an amiable smile to a fiendish glare. There was no more light behind her eyes nor peace in her smile. Her body had served its purpose, but now the pretense was gone.

“What a clever woman,” Sr. Isabella chuckled. “How did you know?”

“We’ve met before,” I answered. “Don’t you remember?”

“It’s difficult to remember all of you,” Sr. Isabella answered. As she licked her lips suggestively, she continued, “I can remember a few of the many offhand. Francis, Gabriel, Agnes. You were all delicious apples ready and ripe to be plucked.”

“You’re disgusting.”

“Oh, *Evita*. . . .” Sr. Isabella trailed off. “Have you lost your sense of humor?”

Although my memories of the exorcism were fragmented, I was able to remember an exchange between myself and the chief exorcist.

“By the Triune God, you are commanded to leave this body of His handmaid, Sister Eva!” Fr. Granger exhorted. “It is the power of Christ which compels you to flee!”

Fr. Abel Granger, an experienced priest, was appointed chief exorcist by the Bishop after Reverend Mother Anna and Fr. David Perrault, our confessor, presented the facts of my case to him and he approved the exorcism. Fr. Perrault was assigned as assistant to Fr. Granger. There would be no others allowed in my cell, especially my Sisters. Reverend Mother Anna stood vigil outside of my cell, praying her Rosary continuously, while she waited for any sign from the priests indicating I was free from the Devil’s grip.

“Am I compelled, man of God?” I cried. As tears trickled down my cheeks, I continued, “I don’t want to go back. Please, man of God, please, let me stay here.”

“What?. . . .” Fr. Perrault asked, but Fr. Granger interrupted him, “You were not asked to speak! It is the power of Christ which compels you to flee!”

A litany of foul words, which spewed from my mouth like vomit, caused Fr. Perrault to bow his head in embarrassment and shame. He had been fooled by the pretense. I continued to berate him until they resumed the ritual.

“It is the power of Christ which compels you!” Frs. Granger and Perrault said in unison. Sprinkling me with Holy Water, Fr. Granger declared, “It is the power of Christ which compels you!”

As the drops of the blessed water burned my flesh, I laughed, an awful, soulless laugh, while I writhed as if in pleasure, saying, “Please, man of God, please, sprinkle all over me!”

“In the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ,” Fr. Granger shouted over me. “It is He who commands you! It is He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of Hell! It is He who commands you to leave this body of His handmaid, Sister Eva!”

“Are you reminiscing?” Sr. Isabella interrupted. “Didn’t we have a good time, Evita?”

Before I was able to respond, Sr. Isabella sighed, “You were always my favorite. Pure and undefiled virgin Eva. It was like another Paradise. You tasted my apple and saw the truth of the world.”

“Your truth is nothing but lies,” I said. “You can offer nothing else. I have renounced you, and all your works, and all your pomps. Leave me and go back to Hell.”

“If I go back to Hell, where will you go?” Sr. Isabella asked. “Are you going to rise to Heaven on the arm of your Savior? I don’t believe you will.”

“What do you mean?”

“Do you believe God truly forgave you?” Sr. Isabella asked. Leaning her head to the side, Sr. Isabella continued, “If you forsook Him, and now forsake me, where do your loyalties lie?”

“I don’t understand.”

“You weren’t meant to understand,” Sr. Isabella said. “Where will you go when you die? Neither Heaven nor Hell. You couldn’t choose between them. Yet we both know there’s nothing else. Perhaps only oblivion. Is that where you would want to go?”

“You’re a liar,” I rebutted. As I sat up slightly in bed, I continued, “You lie. You’ve lied since the beginning. I will not be deceived like Eve in the Garden. I have commended my soul to God, merciful and just, loving and forgiving. You’ll have no part of me.”

Although I spoke as firmly as I could, my hands were shaking. I struggled to fight back tears. The words which came from Sr. Isabella’s mouth frightened me. *What* if *God has not forgiven me?* I remembered with whom I was speaking. *These are lies.* I had to place my trust in God. *They* have *to be lies.* What if I was deluding myself? I was afraid. A dark, all–encompassing fear washed over me, in which I could not trust God, only asking myself, *What if?. . . .* I looked down at my trembling hands, while I remembered an incident near the end of the exorcism.

It was now twelve hours into the exorcism. Fr. Perrault was tired, but Fr. Granger was unaffected. He would see this to its completion. He sprinkled me with Holy Water, held up his Crucifix, and placed a part of his violet stole on my neck.

“It is the Father Who commands you!” Fr. Granger declared. “It is the Son Who commands you! It is the Holy Spirit Who commands you! By the Triune God, you are commanded to leave this body of His handmaid, Sister Eva!”

I felt the ties that bound me to the evil inside of me loosening. Although I was weak in flesh, I was strong in spirit. On the cusp of liberation, I laid back on my bed while Fr. Granger prayed over me for what would be the last time. My eyes were open, but instead of the ceiling, I saw something else entirely. I cannot remember all of it, but I remember Fr. Perrault said, “Her eyes are filled with peace.” Was it a glimpse of Heaven? A glance into the eyes of my Lord and my God? Did I see that blessed and mysterious communion, the ultimate end and fulfillment of my deepest longings? I cannot know in this life. Only in the next. My eyes were still staring as Fr. Perrault wiped tears trickling down the sides of my face. Fr. Granger finished the ritual, blessing us, “In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”

It was gone.

Now, thirty years later, it had come back for me.

“Come with us,” Sr. Isabella whispered. “We miss you.”

I had to make a choice.

“Come with us.”

*Was I forsaken by God?* I did not know. I could never know until it was too late. *God is ever loving and merciful.* Yet doubts about the possibility of my eternal salvation continued to trickle in. *Is this my only choice?*

“No matter what you choose, Evita, I’ll always be with you,” Sr. Isabella glowered in the candlelight. “And when your time comes, I’ll be there.”

I stared directly into its eyes.

For what could be the last time, I prayed.
