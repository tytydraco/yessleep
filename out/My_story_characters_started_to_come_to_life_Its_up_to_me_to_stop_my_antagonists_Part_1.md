 I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I had no ulterior motives behind my work. I just wanted to write entertaining horror stories. But no matter my motivation, I’ve put people’s lives in danger and it’s my responsibility to fix this- well, as much as I can at least. 

I don’t know when all this *actually* started, but I would’ve been completely oblivious if it wasn’t for my brother, Jake. 

Jake burst into my room, clutching his phone like his life depended on it. 

“Matt, you have to read this news article. It’s scary similar to one of the stories you just wrote.”

“What? Let me see,” I requested, itching to know who was ripping off my work.

I snatched the phone out of Jake’s hand. All the color drained from my face. 

*Three Arkansas College Students: Daniel Chen, Savannah Mullen, and Trent Baker Were Reported Missing Yesterday After a Minnesota Hiking Trip Gone Wrong.*

I gulped. My throat began drying up faster than a worm on hot pavement. The article went on to say that their friends, Jeff Vandervurst and Rachel Glass, reported them missing after they were caught in a freak snowstorm on a hike. I knew what really happened.

“The wendigo. It…” I couldn’t finish the sentence, anxiety overwhelming me. 

“Disposed of their bodies? Yeah, that or the uncle did. Jeff and Rachel survived. Does that mean they killed the wendigo?” Jake wondered aloud, finishing my thought. 

“I- I don’t know. There’s too many details of mine to be a coincidence, though. Were you able to find anything else? Like anything from my other stories?” I probed, dreading his response. 

“Uh, I didn’t think about it. Let me see, what should I look up?” 

“Search ‘Charlene obituary.’ If I’m right, there should be an article from a month or two ago,” I instructed, returning his phone. 

“No freaking way. Here it is. It says Charlene Adkins, twenty-eight, passed away in a motor accident. Her memory lives on through her parents: Charlie Morrison, Anne Morrison, and her loving husband, Martin.”

“That confirms it. My stories really are coming to life…” I mumbled as I stared numbly at my monitor. 

“Well, what are we going to do? Can you just delete the posts? Maybe that’ll make this all disappear.”

“No, that won’t work. My posts have been viewed by thousands of readers and they’ve been shared hundreds of times. There’s no telling how many people have seen them.”

“Brag much? Anyway, what are we going to do? We can’t just let these things run rampant, and I doubt the police will believe us if we tell them a bunch of psychos and monsters are on the loose.”

I paused, drinking in the sickening reality of my predicament. I knew what I had to do.

“*I* have to fix this. *We* won’t be doing anything.”

“No. Whatever you have to do, I’m going with you. I know all your stories like the back of my hand, and I’m not letting you fight these things alone,” he said, crossing his arms in defiance. 

Fiery determination gleamed in his eyes.

“Jake, I know you want to help, but I can’t risk you getting hurt because of me. I created these freaks and now I have to clean up my mess.”

“Look, Matt, I know you’re set on defeating these things on your own, but you’re my little brother and I can’t bear the thought of something happening to you. This is my decision, and I know what I’m getting myself into.”

I sighed. 

“You’re sure about this? You know what we’re up against.”

“I’ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life.”

I closed my eyes and rubbed my temples. 

“Fine, you can come. But you got yourself into this. It’s not on me if-”

“I knew you’d come around little bro!” he yelled, ruffling my hair; he knew I hated that.

“Where do we start?” Jake implored as I contemplated our next move. 

“I’ll organize a list from the top priorities to the ones that can wait. You remember where I keep my pistol, right?”

He nodded.

“Good. Bring it to me.”

Jake reemerged, handing me my .9 millimeter. I tucked it into my waistline and rotated my screen to show him the list I’d organized. He frowned.

“Bro, come on. Mr. Pip is second on this list? I freaking hate clowns.” 

“Yeah, that kid is in danger. He’s got a paranormal insane clown in his closet. It’s not too late to back out if you’re scared.”

“No, uh, I’ll be fine… But why is the creepy dude on the balcony at the top of the list? Isn’t he one of the *least* threatening antagonists you have?”

“Yeah well, Sidney’s life is in danger, and I figured it would be good practice for everything else we’re going to face.”

“Okay, that makes sense. But where do we even start?”

“I actually have her phone number. I’ll just give her a call and-”

“Wait, is this that girl from your science class last year? You seriously wrote one of your classmates into a story?” 

“Um, I-”

“Oh, I know what’s going on here. You want to go to Sidney’s first because you know her and you feel bad for getting her into this. That, or you have a crush on her,” he teased, wiggling his eyebrows up and down. 

“Oh, shut up, I don’t have a crush on her. I’ll just call her real quick and we’ll be on the road.”

I could sense my face flush with color as my cheeks turned red. I searched for Sidney’s contact in my phone. I waited with bated breath as the phone rang. 

“Hello?”

“Uh, hey Sidney, it’s Matt from your science class last year. Um listen, I have something to tell you and it’s going to sound really crazy, so just bear with me here.”

“Okay, what is it?”

“I know about the man on your balcony. I know he’s real, and I think you could be in danger.”

“H-how do you know about that? Have you been talking to my therapist? Did she tell you, huh?” 

“No, I swear I didn’t talk to-”

She ended the call.

“That went well,” Jake uttered. 

“Hey, what was I supposed to do? There’s not really a subtle way to bring that up.”

Just then I received a text message. It was from Sidney. 

*218 Fairfield Drive, 11 PM. Don’t be late.* 

“Seriously? That’s in like forty-five minutes!” Jake exclaimed, peeking over my shoulder to read the text. 

“I don’t think we’re really in a position to argue. Pack the essentials. We’re leaving.”

We arrived at Sidney’s at eleven on the dot. My car crept up the driveway as we soaked in our surroundings. My story hadn’t done the house justice.

It was massive, encompassing a large plot of land. It appeared to have fallen into disrepair some time ago. Shutters hung lazily on their hinges, ready to come plummeting down at the slightest gust of wind. Several windows were damaged, large cracks spider-webbing across the glass. The house desperately needed a new paint job. Multiple spots had lost their coating, while the rest was peeling like snakeskin. And at the center of it all, the marble balcony loomed dauntingly overhead. 

“Man, why’d you have to make this place so creepy?” Jake muttered, shattering the silence.

“I write horror stories. What did you expect?” 

“Fair point. Just let Sidney know we’re here so we can get this over with.”

“I did. She should be coming out any-” 

The door swung open, and Sidney marched up to our car with purpose. She scowled at us as we got out to greet her, icy blue eyes staring straight through me.

“Uh, hey Sidney,” I mumbled sheepishly, avoiding eye contact.

“You’re late.”

“Yeah, maybe by like thirty seconds. You didn’t give us much notice,” Jake snapped. 

“Who is this? I told *you* to meet me. I didn’t say anything about Paul Bunyan over there.”

Jake opened his mouth to fire back, but I shook my head. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and kicked at the dirt. 

“He’s my brother. Sorry that I didn’t let you know he was coming. I’ll explain everything, but can we go inside? It’s freezing out here.”

“Fine. You have *a lot* of explaining to do.” 

Sidney gave Jake the once-over, looking him up and down, then reluctantly motioned for us to follow. 

Once inside, we were met with a complete contrast to what we saw upon our arrival. An ornate chandelier shimmered above us, casting dancing rays of light upon a sleek wooden staircase. Its golden railing sparkled like it had just been cleaned prior to our arrival. 

“Come on. We can talk in here,” Sidney said, leading us into the living room.

It was just as beautiful as the foyer. Dated furniture and antiques adorned the room, instilling a sense of nostalgia for a time that I hadn’t been alive for. Ancient couches and lounge chairs lined the walls, complementing the room nicely. At the helm of it all stood a pristine fireplace, white bricks embellishing its exterior. Atop the mantel piece hung a large gloomy black and white photograph depicting a couple staring blankly into the camera. Their cold eyes and dour expressions sent a chill rippling through my body. 

“Well, are you just going to stand there, or are you going to take a seat?” Sidney grumbled, breaking me from my trance.

I plopped down on the couch next to her. Jake opted for a lounge chair. 

“Beautiful house,” I murmured, still in shock at the utter paradox that was the house’s interior. 

“Yeah, I feel like I’m in the 1920’s,” Jake mused, earning him a disapproving glare from Sidney. 

“Okay, just get to the point. Why are you here, and how the hell did you know about the man on my balcony?”

I relayed everything I knew. Sidney didn’t make a sound until I finished, listening intently to every word that fell from my lips. She was hesitant to believe me at first, but I pulled up my Reddit account on my phone, allowing her to read the story I’d written about her. Her eyes grew wide, and she covered her hand with her mouth.

“I don’t need to read any more. Matt… *I* wrote that story. It’s in my diary in my room.”

“But... that’s impossible… I mean, unless I’m, like, a vessel or something.”

Sidney opened her mouth to respond, but Jake interjected.

“Okay, so it’s obvious that whatever magic crap that caused these things to come to life was also responsible for the story being an exact replica. We can figure out the details later. This creepy dude shows up at midnight, right?”

Sidney and I nodded in unison.

“That means we only have twenty minutes to come up with a plan. Anyone have any bright ideas?”

I turned to Sidney. 

“You have kitchen knives here, right?”

“Um, duh.”

“Awesome. You two grab a couple knives. Sid, he’s after you, so you’ll lure him in, while Jake and I will be waiting to ambush him. Simple enough?”

“What, we’re going to stab him to death? What if he has his own knife?”

“Well, that’s not exactly what I had in mind. The knives are just a precaution,” I grinned, flashing my hand cannon. 

“That works for me. Let me show you guys to my old room.”

We trailed behind Sidney, nervous apprehension bubbling inside me the whole way. She took us into the kitchen where she plucked two of the biggest knives from the knife block and handed one to Jake. We proceeded up the stairs, loud creaks emanating through the house after almost every other step. We rounded the corner to Sidney’s empty hot pink room, and I scanned our surroundings. I analyzed the grandiose glass doors leading to the balcony, fixating on their beauty until my gaze fell to the closet. 

“In there. That’s where I’ll hide. Jake, you wait outside the doorway until you hear something. And Sidney, you stand in the middle of the room and try to get him to come inside.”

“Got it. I’m *really* not looking forward to seeing this sick creep again, but if this is what I have to do to rid myself of him, so be it.”

“What do I do? Bust in there and slice him into ribbons when I hear a struggle?”

“You’re just there for backup. In case he somehow overpowers both of us. But that won’t happen.” 

I glanced down at my phone. Ten minutes until midnight. 

“Matt, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Just sit here in the dark and wait for this thing to show up?”

“Yep, pretty much. We only have a few minutes left. Everyone take your places.”

I slid into the closet, keeping it slightly ajar so that I still had a clear view of the balcony. Jake slipped out of the room, while Sidney sat with her legs criss-crossed on the floor. My eyes stayed glued to my phone’s lock screen as the seconds crawled past. 

Nine minutes. Eight minutes. Seven minutes. Trepidation coursed through me like a tsunami. The palms of my hands started to sweat profusely as midnight grew closer and closer. Six minutes. Five minutes. Four minutes. My hands began to tremble, and my heart thumped violently against my ribcaged. Three minutes. Two minutes… Midnight.

Right on cue, a dark emaciated figure appeared at the doors. Dark stringy hair fell past his shoulders. Filthy tattered clothing clung to his nauseatingly thin frame. His eyes lit up upon noticing Sidney. Those pinprick pupils sent a shiver up my spine. A wide manic grin plastered itself across his face, exposing black decaying gums and mouth full of broken rotting teeth. I gulped and readied my firearm.

“Well, hello Sidney! Fancy seeing you here.”

“W-what do you want from me?”

“I just want you to let me in. I can keep you company. You know, now that your Mom is gone. Such a shame that I didn’t get to meet her in person.” 

Sidney slammed her hands against the floor.

“Don’t you dare talk about my mother, you worthless piece of shit.”

Her fear had been replaced with animalistic rage. The man cackled uncontrollably like someone had just told him the world’s funniest knock-knock joke. 

“I mean it! Get in here *now*. I know you have a key.”

The man managed to compose himself, but his smile never faltered.

“Well, if you insist.”

He produced a rusted ancient key from somewhere in his ragged pants and giddily unlocked the doors. He dramatically flung them open and stepped inside. 

Sidney didn’t give him a second to react. She swiftly drew the knife from her belt and slashed at the man’s throat. He gurgled nonsense, dark viscous liquid bubbling from his mouth, as Sidney furiously bludgeoned his chest. I watched motionless from the closet as the light left his eyes. 

Sidney didn’t stop. She stabbed the man ferociously again and again. I snapped myself from my stupor and anxiously approached her. 

“Uh, Sid. I think you got him. He looks pretty dead.”

She dropped the knife and turned to me. She was drenched in blood. Her whole outfit had been painted a deep crimson. But through all the bodily fluid, I could see tears flowing down her cheeks. She sobbed hysterically, her wails reverberating through the corridors. I rubbed her back and tried to calm her down the best I could. After a couple agonizing minutes, she wiped the tears from her face. We sat in silence, staring at the pockmarked body before us, until she finally spoke.

“I know you were wondering why Mom isn’t here. I didn’t write it into the story because I just wasn’t ready to process it. Mom died a couple months ago. She had a brain aneurysm. I didn’t even get to say goodbye.”

Tears welled in her eyes as she told me that. My heart broke for her. 

“Sidney, I’m so sorry.”

I hugged her tightly. She reciprocated, wrapping her shaking arms around my own quivering frame. I held her like that for a long time, relishing every second of her comforting embrace, until we both simultaneously let go. 

“I don’t know if you heard about it while we were in school, but I know your pain. My parents both died in a car accident a couple years back. Jake basically raised me for those last two years of high school. I have no idea what I’d do without him.”

“Aw stop, you’re making me blush.”

We hadn’t even noticed Jake leaning against the doorway. 

“Not sure if you two love birds noticed or not, but slim creepy sorta liquified while you two were having your moment.”

“Uh, we’re not. I mean, I’m not. Um it. I,” I stuttered helplessly as Sidney and I promptly sprang to our feet. 

He was right. The man was gone, replaced with a pool of deep black liquid. 

“Jake and I can help you clean this up. Where do you keep the cleaning supplies?”

“No, it’s okay I can get it. It’s late. You two should get some rest. Thank you, Matt.”

She flashed me a soft smile. I did the same.

“Sorry for the mess. I’ll text you tomorrow.”

Jake and I turned to leave. We’d made it to the top of the stairs when Sidney called out to me.

“Matt, wait! There’s more of these, um, monsters, right?” 

“Yeah. I wrote ten stories. We have nine left.” 

“Let me fight these things with you. Please.”

“No, absolutely not. I can’t have you getting hurt because of me.”

“Matt, please. I’m in this house all alone. I have no one left. The loneliness gets to you after a while… Also, you kinda owe me for writing me into this mess in the first place.”

I wearily sighed. 

“You won’t take no for an answer, will you?”

She crossed her arms and shook her head.

“Fine. Meet me tomorrow at my house. I’ll text you the time and address. I hope you’re not afraid of clowns.”
