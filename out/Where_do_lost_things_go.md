Do places get lost? Not just forgotten or ruined, but truly lost, as in erased from history. Not if they are like mediaeval or some shit, right? A place is mostly constant in the modern world, even if some horrible thing causes them to be abandoned, there is at least a record, a memorial… something.

Six months ago, I saw the village in the hills, and six months ago, I learned that things, even villages, can be lost.

Imagine being me, a woman in her early twenties, commuting to her shitty job in a shitty bus, from her shitty little seaside town. Your eyes barely open and full of sleep, and there, just in the periphery of your vision you see… what, exactly? A couple of grey dots, not enough to be scared but enough to panic because you have used this shitty road so many times, you now know it by hearth and your brain tells you there’s something to that pattern you know so well that just doesn’t hold today.

So, you look. You look and see a couple of stone buildings a few kilometres away. You know they were not there but here they stand, eternal, like they were always there… You blink and before you know it, the bus turns a curve and they disappear.

You try to forget, you really do, you concentrate on your job and listen to some music, try to drift away even, slack off a bit, but it gnaws at you in the back of your mind, that village. How do you even know it is a village? And yet… you know. Like it was always there and you forgot, like it was a fact of life.

By the evening, the confusion and the panic have worn off, if not for the satisfaction of an explanation, at the very least for the pure exhaustion you feel, and you board the bus, to go back to your flat, to rinse off the day, to sleep, even; if you can do that nowadays. The bus turns its familiar curves and you listen to your familiar music and there it is, the familiar unfamiliar, the village in the hills.

What do you do?

Do you ignore it? It isn’t right, you know that it isn’t right, don’t you? Though you have been raised a rational person, something deep inside you, almost primaeval, tells you there is something deeply wrong in that place, *with* that place.

So you do that, it is all you can do, you try to ignore it.

But the village remains there. Every morning and evening, the village in the hills greet you. As the summer turns into winter, you can no longer see it in the darkness of the night, not unless the full moon shines upon the stones of the houses that once stood completed and not ruinous, but even then you know it is there.

You toss in your bed, gaze dreamily at the shower towards it, knowing always where its abandoned stone lays, and soon enough, even in your dreams you dream of the narrow pathways and stone arches of the ruins that crown atop that hill.

Ignoring it will not make it go away, so what do you do next, what can you do next?

What does a doctor do to fight a sickness? What does an engineer do to fix a mistake? They learn about it, they research it, they capture it. So you do that, from most easy to least, you exhaust all your research options: You go through Wikipedia, you go to obscure blogs and forums obscurer still, and once they yield no results, and once your dreams continue for long enough, you go to your local library, you ask your city’s archives, but they all say the same:

The village doesn’t exist.

But if it did, they add, if it did, it would likely be left in a hurry sometime in the last century during the tumultuous political past of your country and have laid abandoned since, for its intended settlers never settled there and hence, the wood decayed, grass grew and in time, even the very stone that built it crumbled to dust, leaving only ruins.

They reiterate, however, that this particular village does not exist.

And yet.

And yet, there it is, standing in the darkness of the night, a mirage that stands against the moon, a monolith and a testament to… what? You do not know.

Finally, you try one last thing, you tell yourself these are all signs of a mental breakdown, this is all just a mistake of some sort, you need a break, and come hell or high water you will take that vacation you so clearly deserve and will forget about your job, your life, and the goddamn village and you will return clear-headed.

Next week, you leave your house, you go on a vacation, lovely time to ski, they say, so you do that: you ski, you rest and you return.

A day later, on the way back to your job, the village is still there.

There are now a few options available to you:

You could once again try ignoring it, although that will fail for certain, and we would just be repeating ourselves, aren’t we?

You can alternatively try to change your job and your city uproot your life and start anew but then again, not only is this plan not feasible economically, there is now a certain paranoid feeling taking hold inside you that, as insane as it sounds,  the village might just follow you wherever you go, and you are not ready to face the consequences or implications of *that*.

So finally, you choose the final option, you will go there, you will see what is so special about that place and you will overcome your fear of ruins, since they are just ruins, right?

So you do that.

You rent a car, you know how to use one but don’t have the money to buy one, of course. you drove it up to the village, the drive to there is not particularly pleasant, not the least because of particularly awful dreams that night you have decided to undertake it before dawn even breaks under the light of the full moon.

As you drive to the village, lines on the road disappear first, followed quickly by the gravel. Finally, you find yourself driving very slowly towards a hill, atop which the remains of what was once a rather large village, some fifty to hundred houses stand. The ruins grow as you approach under the moonlight, and the stones of what once must be houses and fences  glow unnaturally under it, inviting yet menacing at the same time, not unlike a spot of light deep underwater.

Only once you ground yourself by concentrating on the faint light of the car’s speedometer do you find the courage to leave your seat, the car door clicks shut behind you, and you are alone in that dirt road, surrounded by nothingness across a vast distance, the cold mediterranean air chilling you to the bone, layers upon layers of clothes you wear are meaningless under its humid winds and you look at the village, for the first time, in its full glory.

Crowning the hill stands a large structure that once must have belonged either to an individual of great importance, or perhaps serving some communal purpose of know forgotten origin, the stone houses, or what is left of them, then perpetuate downwards from the hill towards the sea, growing in number and radiating somewhat circularly before being cut off abruptly by another large structure, which may be a church of some kind, or possibly a barn, or perhaps still, a fence for some sort of graveyard, hard to tell by the remains and by your uneducated eye.

You take a faltering step towards the hill, and then another, choosing the large structure on the top as your destination. As you climb, you realise to your horror the metal wires, leftovers of some fence some misguided soul have attempted to erect to contain this mess and have failed. Avoiding the wires then, you find your way to the higher levels of the ruins, your pants catching thorns and your boots toppling small rocks.

As the elevation rises, the road up becomes harder to traverse, thornier and rockier still, you cut through houses and realise that though the outer walls stand, most of the insides are gone, wooden floors of the buildings must have rotten away, leaving the basements now united with the actual ground floors.

You almost fall twice, barely balance yourself, you are afraid of snakes in the long grass hitting the path in front of you with a wooden stick to dislodge and deter and might be predator waiting to strik, but none appear. In fact, you realise with a chill not quite attributable to the wind anymore, there are no animals at all; no snakes, birds or even bugs.

At the top of the ruins, on top of the building you have chosen to climb, you stand and look downwards, taking in the view, the houses, the barn, the sea shining below, the wind refusing to howl, the remains of some poor souls who have lived their lives here and then must have departed, never to return ever again.

Why is this place here? You wonder, why me? and then, slowly, another thought takes hold.

This place is a ghost, you tell yourself, it wasn’t here for so long and now it is here; abandoned and drifting, becoming and unbecoming, where was it for all those years of its nonexistence? Where did its stone reside, its wood decayed and its fields invaded by moss and thorns?

In a place whose residents are forced to leave, a place rejected and abandoned by those who were supposed to love it, a place, a vessel whose purpose is denied and whose soil is left unattended… A place left undefended, what sort of things might take hold?

Why the fuck are there no animals?

You recall a documentary; stupid, you know, but still… You recall that ambush predators like crocodiles wait for their prey in silence, and when it does come in their range, the kill is almost instant, the prey never knows it was ever in danger.

Your hand are sweating now, and the night becomes darker, shadows grow longer, you look at the sky, refusing to meet the ground with your eyes, and the stars look different, half-present, half-alien.

Jumping down hard to the rocks below, you hurt your knee, and yet still refuse to look down, as you slowly start to descend, you can’t help but to think back to your initial climb, were those rocks really rocks or bones? Was that piece of rainwater dark brown because of dirt or bloo? And more important than all, why do you refuse to look down.

Why do you refuse to look down?

Stars twinkle, deep inside your brain, an ancestor of yours is screaming your name, look up, they say, look up and for the love of god, do not meet *its* jaws.

You stumble your way down the hill, falling, scraping and scratching. When you fall on your knees, you refuse to open your eyes because you know, you just know that if you open them, you will know where the lost things go.

The last few metres, you don’t walk or run, but roll down the hill, you throw yourself into the car and speed away, refusing to look back, refusing to think back, even.

The village was still there, for a while, until one day, on a rainy winter morning, you realise it is gone. At first, there was relief; jubilation, even. But then you remember back to that stupid documentary, you remember that ambush predators often change their location once they find a prey.

And sure enough, you soon hear of a missing hiker in the area you live, a young man who has left behind a child and a wife, the authorities search for him day and night for almost a week before calling off the search, no sign of him, they say, it is as if he has vanished, no way to know where he, or his body, even is.

You know where he is though, he is where the lost things go.
