I was a construction worker living with my parents in Mexico City. It's like the LA of Mexico but it needed lots of construction to get that way. I was always the youngest compared to my coworkers but it made me the best at getting things done efficiently. One building we were working on was almost finished, the roofing was all that was needed.  

On the morning of September 19, 1985 mother nature punished the city in an unimaginable way. An earthquake so huge almost every structure and home became ruble and death. I was late that day, I wasn't on the roof when it happened, everyone who was had become a clump of splattered jelly on the ground. Limbs contorted and cracked into positions I couldn't have even imagined of. Faces unrecognizable and red leaking everywhere. I ran to help one of them, I wish I knew who, I pulled him by his arms until the building collapsed over me. I could hear the unnatural  groans and screaming from my coworkers. It was as if theyre tounges had been ripped away. These people had families and children. I was scared to open my eyes. 

I faced my fears and opened them, seeing nothing but darkness. I couldn't tell up from down, what scared me more was the constant sound of rumbling that still continued. I was afraid the building would break into smaller parts and finish the job. I tried to control my breathing but I couldn't; I couldn't calm down because of the sounds of torture around me. Bot being able to use my other senses enhanced my hearing. Out of desperation I screamed but all it did was make everyone else louder. I couldn't do this.

I thought about my parents; my love for them and how broken they'd be without me. I can't die. I tried  to climb to my left until I reached rubble. Sirens passed by but no one came near. It feels like hours have passed by, the shake is finally over. People now stopped looking for help and started focusing on survival. 

I saw a white light in the rubble and tried climbing to it. It was a flashlight, someone had a flashlight. I crawled as close as I could and yelled through the hole I saw the light from. 

"Hey! Hey! Help me! Light! We need it!... Help! Please for the love of god!"

There was no response, that man is not with us anymore.

I needed to get through but there was such a tight space. I still needed to try. I fit my head easily. I kept my hands to my side and squeezed my shoulders through with only a few scratches but my arms couldn't make it. I pushed and squeezed but nothing. My hands felt numb and I know they were red. I pulled and pulled until I heard a crunch in my elbow. I made my left arm through and fit the rest of my body through fine. Pain rushed but it was beat by adrenaline. I picked up the flashlight and looked around; no sunshine to be seen. 

I heard someone yelling from outside.
"We are here to help! Stay calm and put!"

The beautiful feeling  of life was going to come over me. This moment of calm is when i noticed all the screamed had stopped at some point. It didnt torture me anymore. I waited there for what felt like forever until I heard them faintly say" That's everyone? They're all gone! Next one! Go! Go!" 

I tried screaming and calling but no one responded. I was alone. No support or way out. I cried. I didn't want to accept there was no way out. I finally felt the pain in my arm and it's extreme hurt made me faint.

Upon waking up I found light to my left. Either more building crumbled or this was a gift from god; there was a way out. A hole with a 2 foot diameter. I fit my head through easily but my shoulder couldn't. I got to see the outside world again. The distruction was hideous but the sky was beautiful. A kid ran by and saw me; he quickly told me he'd come back with help and I thanked him. The few minutes I stayed like this felt like seconds, I finally relaxed knowing I was seen and can see. I was saved shortly after using the power of machinery.
