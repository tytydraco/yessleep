It started with the occasional raps from the mirror.

I never gave it much thought- probably just rats hiding out above in the walls.

That is- until I started finding the notes under them.

On plain paper, scribbled with a black crayon were the words,

Hello.

I smiled to myself and walked towards my husband, piling some sugar into his morning coffee.

“Okay, weird question,” I said, holding up the note. “Did you leave this under the mirror? It’s kinda... creepy.”

He glanced at the paper, and his brow furrowed. “No. Why would I do that?”

“Come on, Manuel. You’re the computer science guy. If you wanted to mess with me, I’d expect something, I don’t know, smarter?” I tried to keep my tone light, but the knot in my stomach tightened.

His face grew serious. “I didn’t leave that there. I don’t know where it came from.”

I laughed nervously. “So, what, you think a ghost wrote this?”

He didn’t respond. His silence unsettled me more than I cared to admit.

"This isn't a joke, manuel. Tell me the truth."

After multiple attempts of convincing me, I gave in. We decided we would take action after another note or action from the stalker or prankster.

The day after this incident, I walk towards my dresser.

I step on something.

A note.

We see you.

I clearly wanted nothing of this bullcrap, and I made clear of that to my husband.

He still insisted he did NOT put that there, So me, still believing him to be the prankster, told him that we would go to the police station to report this.

He agreed.

I was a bit taken aback by this.

The police were not helpful at all as you can imagine- they insisted that there needs to be an "evidence of a threat" and it is the only way they can take action.

Frustrated and angry, I burst into my room and-

Another note.

I brandished at it, clutching it in my hands.

We want to escape.

I was so angry I shouted to the ceiling,

"Who the fuck are you? As far as I know, you are a pathetic little shit who's too scared to come out."

For a long time, I stared at the mirror before me, clutching my note.

That's when I saw it.

I noticed a subtle- smile appearing on my reflection- subtle, but it was there.

Almost as if my reflection was- mocking me in a way.

In a state of utterless panic, I tried to change my emotion. I acted as if I was- sad.

The reflection still stood that way.

It didn't change, it didn't move.

Shivering now, I just wanted to get out of that room as fast as I could.

I stood up from the chair-

The reflection was still sitting.

I was fucking horrified.

I screamed for my husband, who came dashing into the room.

I told my husband all about this- ofcourse he didn't believe me- until he looked into the mirror as well.

Now, both of our reflections were standing now, and they had one of the most horrifying smiles plastered on their faces. I'll never be able to forget it.

Their mouths were warped in some way- almost cruelly- like in that movie 'smile.' it kept staring at us. I was done with this, I told my husband to go get a bat and to beat the living hell out of that mirror.

They just stood still.

Watching.

He started across the room, holding a bat in his hands. He thrust it onto the mirror-

Nothing.

Our reflections just kept staring at us.

I told my husband we were getting out of this house, pronto.

We locked our doors and we headed to our car.

Reaching it and getting into the car, I smashed the car door shut, when I noticed my husband was not getting in.

"What?" I asked him.

He stood there, frozen. Again.

He was shaking.

The knot in my chest was beginning to tighten.

I got out of the car and made my way to his door when I saw those little motherfuckers staring back at us.

With that same smile.

Me and my husband ran towards the driveway and sat there for what seemed like eternity.

I entered the house again, alone this time.

My insides writhed like snakes- I couldn't give in to those things-whatever they might be. They can't take over and lock us out of our own house.

I made my way towards the mirror.

The mirror was broken.

The shards looked like there was something inside of them- something almost whirling in them.

On the floor, a note scribbled in black crayon as well,

The reflections are freed. Rejoice. We were never meant to be confined.
