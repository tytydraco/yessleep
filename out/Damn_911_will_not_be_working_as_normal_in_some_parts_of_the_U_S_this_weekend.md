**Operator:** 911, what is your emergency?

**Caller:** *anxious* There’s um… there’s someone outside my house – my window. Outside the living room.

**Operator:** No, there isn’t.

**Caller:** *voice trembling* I’m – what? Please, I’m really scared-

**Operator:** He’s not outside the living room. He’s moved to your kitchen.

**Operator:** 911, what is your emergency?

**Caller:** Oh thank God, you’re a different person. The last operator really scared me, and I’m – I, I’m on edge right now. See there’s a person outside my house, I can hear him walking around, and I live out in the – I’ve got no close neighbors, and I’m home alone. I think – I think he’s between me and my car.

**Operator:** Okay, I hear what you’re saying and a squad car is on its way right now. Stay on the line with me, and we’ll walk you through this, okay, Laura?

**Caller:** Perfect, yes, thank you so mu– wait, how did you know that?

**Operator:** How do I know that an officer is on the way? I have easy access to all the information. I know everything.

**Caller:** No. *panting* How did you know that my name is Laura? I didn’t tell you that.

*pause*

**Operator:** 911, what is your emergency?

C: *hysterical* I don’t know if I should call you back – I don’t know – I’m panicking, and my phone isn’t connecting to anyone else. I hear – there are two of them outside, tapping on my windows – they want me to know that they’ve surrounded the house-

**Operator:** Ma’am, please-

**Caller:** Oh God help me, I’m so scared-

**Operator:** Ma’am, I need you to listen-

**Caller:** Are they going to hurt me?

**Operator:** Yes.

*Caller disconnects*

**Caller:** Barry? *Barry!* I’ve been trying and trying to get ahold of you – there’s people in the house, they broke the window and they’re coming for me-

**Barry Graystone:** Laura, did you call 911?

**Caller:** 91 – Three times, yes, and they – Barry, I don’t know what’s wrong, but 911 isn’t working right, they’re trying to hurt me or something, oh God, Barry, it’s just so fucked up.

**Barry Graystone:** I know.

**Caller:** W-what do you know?

**Barry Graystone:** *gasping* I’m so – I’m so, so sorry, Laura. They forced me to tell them when you’d be home alone, when they – when they could come for you.

**Caller:** *whispering* Barry?

**Barry Graystone:** *quietly* It was either you or the kids, Laura. They made me choose.

**Caller:** Barry? Barry, what the fuck are you talking about? *pounding noise* They’re in the house, they’re about to knock down the bedroom fucking door! 

**Barry Graystone:** *crying softly* I’m sorry. Goodbye.

**Caller:** Barry! What are they going to do to me? Barry?

**Barry Graystone:** They told me that they’re going to keep you alive for what comes next. I just couldn’t do that to the kids. I – I can’t. 

**Caller:** Barry? What the fuck did they tell you they’re going to do to me? Barry? BARRY! *muffled sounds* your hands off of me *muffled sounds* OH GOD NO *wood breaking* please, that hurts so *tearing sounds* stop *screams*

*Barry Graystone disconnects*
