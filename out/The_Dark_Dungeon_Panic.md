I never intended to write a memoir.  There’s a lot of my life I would rather not remember.  And there’s far too much of it that nobody should know.  I wish I didn’t know it.  

Early today I visited the doctor.  My wife, her name, isn’t important for this, she was with me, and we got the news.  Not a breaking news report, a confirmation of what we knew.  Cancer, brain cancer.  I think the doctor called it Glioblastoma.  GBM for short.  Maybe a year left.  We went to Applebee's afterward, and she drove me home.  

We didn’t really talk about it much.  At least today.  There will be time to talk.  Not much.  Not much before a thing in the brain eats away what I was, consuming me to a husk of fibers and bones and hair.  Time to make plans, to talk, to fill out paperwork and prepare for more paperwork.  To make calls.  To write emails.  But not today.

We just spent time together.

We’ve been married, or maybe it’s better to say we would have been married 40 years this year.  My body may make it to the anniversary, but I probably won’t.  That’s OK.  Of those 40 years together, we’ve spent about 25 of them together.  She was a widow for nearly as long as she was a wife.

She went to bed but I decided to stay up.  Said I was going to help myself to a pop and write a letter to the kids.  Maybe they’ll read this.  Probably not, we raised them right, and they have kids of their own.  Businesses, families.  But not family business.  I made sure of that.

I don’t mind the terminal diagnosis.  I’ve lived enough.  I’ve lived too much.  If there is a Heaven, I’ll be going, I killed enough to get in.

Let’s start from the beginning.  The beginning of my path that led me here, the night I learned too much, and became part of something that can never be unlearned.  I pray to the Heavenly Father my children don’t read this.

\*\*\*

In 1980 I had nearly finished my first semester at BYU.  Pre-Dental.  I’d met my future wife on the first day of class, English 102.  But that isn’t important really.  I had returned home though, because it was Thanksgiving and I was homesick, even though it was only 8 hours away.  My folks loved Thanksgiving, and as us kids aged out of the house and into school, or missions, or work or families of our own, we always came back.  I was the second youngest.  My next oldest brother was on a mission in Argentina or something, but otherwise we were all there.

Thanksgiving was the usual stuff, not worth talking about it.  

The next morning, sleeping off a turkey hangover on the couch, the phone woke me.

“Young Residence,” my mom said.  She was up and dressed already, beams of frosty sunlight highlighting her purple Mickey Mouse sweatshirt.

“Why yes!  Of course he’s here, let me get him!” she said, beckoning me to come to the phone.  

She placed her hand over the receiver, “It’s your friend Clayton!”

I untangled myself from the blanket fort I’d buried myself in the night before and crossed the room.  I thanked her as she handed me the phone, she kissed her fingers and planted them on my forehead and hurried to the kitchen.

“Hey welcome back,” the voice on the other end said.  It was Clayton.  He was my friend.  We’d known each other since 1st grade.

“Thanks, I’m not back for long, just for the weekend, how you been?” I said.

“Cool man!  Hey, you wanna hang out tonight?  A couple of us are gonna get together and do some stuff.”

“What kind of stuff?”  

“Nothing special, maybe some games!  Joshua just got Fantasy Forest, and it sounds pretty neato.”

“Sure, pick me up at 6:00,” I said, and he agreed.  No sooner had I hung up the phone when my 2nd oldest sister walked in, retrieved the phone from the cradle and dialed.  She glared at me until I left the room.

Clayton and I graduated from high school at the same time, but while I had been accepted into the pre-dental program, he had gone for a business degree at the local university, and got on part time at his dad’s bookstore.  We had talked a few times since I moved out of state, but the long-distance rates were too high and agreed it would be better to wait until I came back on breaks to catch up on the local gossip and tell lies to each other about what girls we were dating or truths on how hard classes were.

\*\*\*

At 5:55 a horn honked outside.  I hugged my mom and dad and waved at my brothers and sisters who had gathered to watch football in the family room and left.

Parked on the curb was Clayton, looking like I’d last saw him in September, driving the same pear yellow 1975 AMC Pacer.  I got in the passenger seat and before I could even buckle in, he gunned the engine and we were off.  Tearing through the suburbs laughing and joking and showing and telling.  

“Where we going anyway?” I asked.

“You know Morris?” he replied.

“Moe?  Yeah, I used to ride the bus with him.  He has to be what?  27 now?  He's still playing board games?”

“You know it, but he’s hosting a party, and has a new game he wanted us to try.”

Moe was an odd kid, I knew that when I was an actual kid and he was a teenager.  He was always telling tales about monsters and elves and listening to Led Zeppelin records.  He wasn’t in our church, but he was a pretty nice guy, just kind of weird.

“What game?

“It’s a new one.  It’s called ‘Dungeons and Dragons.”

\*\*\*

Moe’s house was in a newer part of town.  Built on higher ground, yards against a canal, their view of fields and railroad tracks and the lights of the repair shops and car dealerships about a mile away.  Short trees decorated the neighborhood, leaves discarded over the previous weeks and raked or mulched back into lawns a dusting of snow lurked in the shadows.  

Kids in winter sweaters threw a football among themselves, the one in possession of the ball making a time out sign, as they moved to allow us to pass down the street.  I waved, and they returned the gesture.  A group of men gathered around a front porch barbeque grill, they waved as we passed.  An old farmer, denim pants, shirt, jacket, a baseball cap atop his white hair waved as we entered an intersection.

“Oh heck!” Clayton yelled, as he veered the wheel.

“What the heck are you doin?” I said.

“It’s a bee!  It came through the window!”

“Well get it out!”

The car lurched to a halt, the door open before coming to a stop.  The engine died.

“Get out of here you little creature!” Clayton yelled at the bee. 

It wasn’t a bee.  It was a yellow jacket, lazily walking up the half-rolled window, sluggish with the cold, uncertain or uncaring of its trek.

“Just shoo it out,” I said.  Clayton for his part fanned the door open and closed, hoping perhaps to gather enough lift to eject the insect, or perhaps let the car take flight.

I looked around for something to push the little beast away.  Clayton kept an immaculate interior, but I found a roll of paper towels in the back seat.  Exiting the vehicle I took the roll, walked around, and pressed it against the window.  The yellow jacket climbed onto paper, and I carefully walked to nearby bushes, depositing the little thing to a naked bush on the side of the road.

“Problem?”  A voice from the other side of the intersection, the old farmer in denim.

“Yellow jacket,” I said.

“Ah.  They’re harmless ‘nough, thank you for not killing it.  The cold’ll do it natural,” he said with an uncertain rhythm.  

I waved and smiled and got back into the Pacer.  Clayton restarted the engine and drove.

“Sorry, I get freaked out by those things, and I’m kinda like deathly allergic,” he said.

“It’s OK, nobody’s on the road.  Seems late in the year for one of those things.

“I wonder if I have a nest in here somewhere.”

Clayton turned the heater off.  Silence for the remainder of the drive, save for the whine of the AMC motor, our ears tuned, waiting for buzzing.  

\*\*\*

Moe's house sat non-descript in the middle of a block of houses.  All different, yet feeling the same in the manner of new construction.  A garage on the right hand side, yellow paint with an orange trim.  The windows were curtained, or blinds drew.  A single evergreen tree stood about 10 feet tall in the middle of the yard, surrounded by mulch and stonework in a circular pattern.  Two cars occupying the driveway, and two more were parked on the street in front of the house.

“Who else is here?”

“I don’t know, I don’t recognize the cars.”

The cars were newer, German imports.  A dusting of snow covered their windshields. We parked behind a new BMW, no license plate.

“Who all lives here?” I asked.

“I don’t really know,” Clayton kept the engine running.

“Have you been here before?” 

“No, I haven’t seen Moe since middle school.”

Maybe it was the yellow jacket incident, but the mood was off.

“We could go somewhere else,”

“Nah, it’s OK.” 

“Let’s just go in, and we can leave early if it's lame.” 

We nodded at each other; Clayton cut the engine.

A cardboard cutout of a pilgrim hung on the door, along with several cutouts of turkey hands.  We knocked.  Waited.  Then knocked again.

The door opened and the throbbing rumble of heavy metal music hit us in the face like a gust of wind.  A guy with buzzed hair and a ratty goatee sitting atop a polo shirt greeted us. Without the mustache, he’d have no expression.

“Game?” he said, heavy accent watered down by the music.

Clayton and I looked at each other and nodded in unison.

“Is uh, Moe here?” Clayton asked, nearly shouting over the sound of the music.

“Da.  Come,” he moved aside and we stepped in.  The house was split level, my eyes naturally cast themselves down and to the left, where a short stairwell led to a darkened lower section.  To the right and up, red light bathed the ceiling and walls.

“Up,” the man said, and we climbed, Clayton in front, the man following close behind.  Uncomfortably close.

Clayton paused at the top of the stairs, moving aside just enough for me to stand beside him.  The man pushed past us without a word, and walked to a closed door, opened it, stepped inside, and closed it again.

The room was off.  On one side was a couch, next to that a chair.  An empty, fallow fireplace wedged against one wall of the room, and on the other side several bottles of clear liquid sat atop a custom built bar.  A couple of bare red lights glowed from shadeless lamps in the center of the room, dyeing a stain marred cream carpet the color of watered wine.

“This is weird,” I said.

“Yeah, maybe we should just-”

An opening door cut Clayton off.  A shirtless man, thick faced and heavily muscled stepped out, tattoos adorning nearly every inch of his exposed skin, save for his face, hands, and neck.  He eyed us and walked to the bar, taking a bottle of the clear liquid and downing a glug.

“Ahoy-hoy!”

Another man clad in a tall pointy hat covered in light-colored moons and stars stood in the doorway.

“Steve, as an act of hospitality, do reduce the volume of the tunes, our awaited visitants have arrived!  And we have business!”

The man at the bar glugged the bottle again, bent down and the music died.  Ringing ears filling the space it left.

“Moe?”  I asked.  It had been a while since I had seen him in middle school, but he was different now.  Always kind of a bigger kid in school, but he was easily 400 pounds.  His legs packed like Pillsbury biscuit dough into a rotting pair of sweatpants.  An open bathrobe painted with stars and moons covered a 2112 t-shirt.  Patches of hair reached to one another desperate to form a beard, only succeeding under his jawline and in between his eyebrows.  Acne scars marred his jiggling face.

“I was once known by that moniker, but I am now known as-”

“I get buckets,” the shirtless man interrupted.

“Indeed, please fetch the bucket, and inform the dowager of the arrivals!”

Steve, I guess the shirtless guy’s name was Steve, grasped the bottle and walked past us, his legs steady.  I turned to see him descend the stairs, catching a glimpse of something metal tucked into the back of his jeans.

“Listen Moe, I don’t think we can stay for long,” Clayton said.  He hid it well, but I could detect nervousness in his voice.

“You, dear duo can stay long, and you may stay long!”  Moe said, shuffling his bulk to the chair.  “For yesterday as we gave thanks to this land, today we celebrate with a feast!”

Clomping from below.  Steve carrying a bucket in each hand, his exposed muscles straining against the combined force of gravity and contents.  We instinctively moved aside as he sloshed past.

Steve set the buckets in the middle of the room and returned to the bar, depositing ice and water into a pitcher.  Moe breathed heavily, snorting through nasal passages blocked by internal fat.  I gently toed the side of Clayton’s shoe.

“Yeah, I think we’ll be-” I was cut off.

A door behind the bar opened.

The room was bright white, a figure stood in the doorway.

“Mi amore!” Moe said, straining to exit the chair.

The figure was a woman.  Her hair tangled and clumped.  She wore a slippers underneath stained sweatpants, a threadbare nightgown clung to her frail shoulders.  She stepped in the room as the red and white light mixed.  She was holding a lump of laundry in her left hand, close to her chest. 

The laundry moved.

…and cried?

Was that a baby under a blanket?

“Ah, m’lady has endowed us with her exquisite resplendence!” Moe exclaimed, still seated.  He removed his pointy hat and bowed, mostly at the neck and shoulders, arching the hat with his arm in a graceless furrow at the woman.

“Oh my holiest of maidens!  We have prepared the humble guests in anticipation of your honorness!”

Moe creaked his chair, propelling himself upward, and waddled to the woman.  He took a knee before her, taking her free hand, and ceremonially kissed the top of it.  The baby under the blanket squirmed as he let go her hand.

“Hark!  And allow me to introduce my exquisite inamorata!”  He was back on his feet, removing his hat and doffing it once again, first to us, then to her.

“Here is Clayton and Lucas, schoolyard chums of mine, lo but it seems a lifetime ago.”

“Nice to meet you,” Clayton said.  I waved.

The woman paid us no mind.  Her sunken eyes staring straight ahead she shuffled toward the buckets.  The baby under the blanket in her arm squirmed and murmured, deeper than a baby’s voice should be.

Moe fell in behind her, his hand hovering just above the small of her back.

“Optimates!  It is with great pleasure you shall gormandize every sense that makes you human!  For tonight you will join in my ascension!  My level up, if you will!”

Moe reached into his robe pocket, his fist emerged shaking small before depositing it in the opposite hand.  He looked, smiled.  

“I cast Stinking Cloud!”

This was getting too weird, the baby under the blanket kicked again, and Steve the shirtless guy scratched his stomach.  

“Moe, we’re gon–”

The smell hit.  It had crept through the still air of the room, glacial.  It ground against my nose and crushed my eyes.  To this day I’ve never smelled anything so bad, so oppressive, so wrong.  A mix of packrat nest and spousal betrayal.  Of dead skunk and locker room menace.  The smell of the family dog ripping your newborn baby to shreds in front of you.  I fell to my knees and dry heaved.  My eyes watered.

“Steve!  Bring forth the receptacles for our guests!” I heard Moe exclaim.  Somewhere in the distance.  Somewhere in an invisible vulgar fog.

My mouth watered, demanding to vomit.  I tried to swallow, but each dry spasm down my throat brought more of the evil air into my mouth.  Something grabbed my head.  Steve, my eyes barely registering the waistband of his jeans before he forced my head down.

He must have slid the bucket in front of me.  He held my head above it.  

“Blevat.”

For a second I gazed inside the bucket.  Something organic.  Like ground hamburger floating in crude oil sprinkled with grass and topped by duckweed.  I closed my eyes as he forced my head closer to the bucket.  

My stomach rebelled and I wretched.  The splashing, a sound of such revulsion I puked again.  I could hear Clayton beside me puking and splashing too.  God please don’t let this get on me.  

One more time I wretched.  Steve gathered my hair in his fist, pulled my head forward before quickly pushing me back.  I fell onto my backside, revulsed my pants and hands were touching this filthy floor.  Clayton fell beside me, wiping his mouth with his jacket sleeve.

I spit away from me onto the ground and drew a deep breath.  Bracing myself for more of the gaseous pudding.  But the air was clear.  Back to the smell of dirty carpet and wet paint and Steve’s vodka breath.

The woman, what was her name?  Stared at us, the baby squirming silently, still completely covered by the blanket.  Her face as expressive as a church statue.

“Ah, stew of men!” Moe said. “My covenant to you my dear boon companions, is that this method of extraction is of greater preference to the alternatives!  Now please, rest!”

Steve drug the pair buckets across the room, placing both in front of the woman, leaving a wet trail of parallel splashes in their wake.  His task complete he turned toward us, reaching into the back of his jeans, the object that had been tucked into his waistband was now in his hand.  

A gun.

“Sidet,” he spoke, the gun pointed at me, then at Clayton.  We planted our backsides on the dirty floor.  

I glanced at Clayton, his eyes were narrow, drool around the corners of his mouth, his lips moving silently.  Prayer.  He was praying.  I joined him, tried to join him, but couldn’t remember the words.  

“I don’t want to die, please not like this,” was all my brain could muster.

Moe reached into the pocket of his sweatpants, pulling out something with his meat sweaty fist.  He blew into his hand, shaking a few times, then holding his clenched fist gently to the mouth of the woman.  

“Hark lady!  May the cataglottism of luck and skill transform stereo to mono!” he giggled a snort.  Her face didn’t move.  Had she even blinked?

He shook his hand a few more times then dropped whatever was in his hands to the ground, some small object.  He knelt to inspect.  

“17!” he yelled, falling to both knees, “17! 17!   Excelsior!”

The woman stared ahead, but the baby began to stir beneath the blanket.  First from where its feet should be, squirming further up the body toward the woman’s shoulder.  The woman placed one sock covered foot into a bucket directly in front of her, then the other foot into the next bucket.  The overfilled slop bubbling onto the carpet, wicking up her pant legs.

Squirms turned to thrashes under the blanket.  

“Heavenly Father, Jesus, please...” I said, grasping at the carpet to push myself further from this.  Clayton followed, his shoulder touching mine as we backed against the wall.

“What’s wrong with that baby?” he asked.

Holes appeared in the blanket covering the baby.  Something was ripping…or gnawing…it away from the inside.

“That’s not a baby…” I said.

With a showman’s flourish, Moe tore away her blanket and frayed nightgown.  

“Ta-da!” he yelled, holding his arms to present the sight of the woman.

It wasn’t a baby.  What should have been her right arm had been melded, welded, to her torso, melted callouses of skin and tumors, a stomach covered in patchwork scars and hair.  She had no right arm, only a mass of meat, jaundiced yellow, covered in dozens of black holes.  No, her entire body was covered in holes.  

A string of fiber appeared from one hole, then another, and another, like black sinew, tendons, strings of revulsion.  The fibers coalesced in front of the woman in a tangle of writhing, slick, menace.  

“I present to you my cherished visitants, a sight unseen by few mortal men!” Moe said.  “For your eyes are beholden to Darja, the Witch of Tambov, she lives!  And as in service to me, I am in service to her!”  

“Za nashimi usiliyami pus' budut nashi usiliya,” a broken gurgling voice spat.  Fibers vibrated from her throat, her mouth vomiting a mass of the wet black organic cables.  They reached out and caressed Moe’s cheek.  He giggled, his balled fist at his side rising and falling rapidly with elation.

Clayton’s hand spidered toward me, his fingers touching the top of mine, then the sleeve, tugging. His eyes met mine, pupils dilated in the dim light, whites darting toward the stairs, lingering downward. Before I could process what he meant, he was on his feet, pulling the sleeve of my coat, finding resistance with my slowness to act, he let go and sprinted for the door.

“NYET!” Steve yelled and fired the handgun.

Clayton cleared several more feet, unhit or not knowing he was hit and was almost to the stairs when fibers from the witch monster were around him, bunching around his feet like a gaucho’s bolo.  He fell, arms barely able to brace his fall.  The black sinews wrapping up his legs before his arms made contact with the floor.  He reached for something to pull him further way, grasping at dirty carpet as the witch yanked toward her.

I was on my feet, trying to get to the stairs, hoping to pull him away when my own feet left the ground.  I braced for impact but found myself floating.  Stinging, hot laces wrapped around my stomach, holding me airborne, squeezing the breath out of me.

“Nay, nay, gentlemen, you have been invited!  You can’t leave unless disinvited, it’s basically reverse vampire rules!” Moe giggled porkily.

The fibers bore through my winter coat and into my skin, barbed like fishhooks, each struggling wiggle dug them deeper.

“M’lady, show them their fortune!” Moe said.

The room went grey.  I’ve spent the better part of 45 years trying to think of what I saw then.  She reached into my mind, and showed me something, but not visually.  A feeling of panic, of dread.  Of eternity.  Of fire and pain and hunger.  A utopia of perfect suffering.  A reaping hook severing me from ancestor and offspring. A hammer setting the stone of a perfect cacotopia made of my teeth.  

The fibers retracted.  I fell to the floor, pain added to pain.  The blows inside my head turning to knocking sounds below.

The door?

Through my haze I registered Steve stepping over us and walking down the stairs.  I heard him say something, then the sound of a muffled scream and ripping meat.  Heavy boots on the stairs.

Someone on the stairs.  I squinted to clear my head, something blue and human shaped.  Blinking rapidly, my vision focused on an old man in a denim jacket and jeans.  He looked familiar.

Something crawled on my hand, prickling legs and a soft breeze.  A yellow jacket, its alternating black and yellow abdomen gently touching the back of my hand as it walked along, wings fluttering.  I froze.  Another landed beside it.

“What is the intention of this encroachment!”  Moe yelled toward the old farmer.  “Lo to those who trespass!”  

Moe’s hand shook back and forth, something metal bouncing in his ham hand, He murmured, fist raised, preparing to drop the object.  

“I cast-” cut off mid-sentence, his body flying sideways, shoulder wedging into the drywall.  Catapulted by the force, Moe lost the object.  It arced toward me, landing beside my head.  A circular thing made up of triangles covered in numbers.  Number 1 facing up.

The stranger walked toward the woman-thing, bowlegged and slow.  Moe wheezed in pain, slumped against the wall.  Clayton was free from the fibers, trying to get to his feet.  I knew fleeing was the safest thing to do, every one of my own fibers screamed at me to run, to fly down the stairs and get into Clayton’s car and go home.  But this stranger saved me.  What if he needed help?  

“Ma’am, are you spreadin’ Commonism here?”  The old man’s voice was hoarse, echoing, electric, tinged with a rural western accent.

“Darja my love, the numbers!  What does the number read?!” Moe burbled from the corner.

Fibers shot out toward the strange object, more fibers wrapped around the old farmer.  On instinct I reached for the object and batted it down the stairs before the hideous strings could reach it.

“You knave!”  Moe yelled.

I struggled to my feet only to have the fibers redirect from the object to my neck.  The squeeze was immediate, barbed hooks digging in, squeezing my throat closed.  In a panic I thrashed against them, their grip growing tighter.  The two yellowjackets on my hand launched and landed on the rope of fibers, plunging their stingers into organic material.  More followed and the mass was covered in yellow and black and wings and legs and biting mandibles.

“Curses upon you!  I cast…GUN!”  Moe reached into the pocket of his bathrobe, a snub-nosed revolver emerged in his hand.  He took aim at the old farmer.

“NO!”  Clayton yelled and dove toward Moe.  The gun moved.  Barked twice and Clayton went down  Moe adjusted his aim and emptied the cylinder into the old farmer.

A wave of sadness and rage filled me.  Blinding me.  On instinct I was on my feet, tearing through the tentacles around my neck, charging the seated form of Moe.  His weak hand awkwardly dug into a pocket of the robe but couldn’t fit, in desperation he threw the revolver at me.  

As the gun lazily circled toward me, I caught it in my right hand and dove into him, leading with the handle down hard onto the top of his head.  He squealed, thrashed, I hit him again and his massive arms circled my waist.  I was on top of him, but I’d lost an angle to deliver a killing blow.  He squeezed.  He flipped me in a sloppy takedown and put his weight on top of me.  

My lungs turned into a one-way valve, breath could escape but I couldn’t bring any more in.  I beat against his kidneys with the gun, and with the other hand grabbed fat and twisted.  He raised his hips to better position himself over me and I found my opening.  I kneed him in the crotch.

“Oooooowww!”  He yelled and loosened his grip.  I escaped, positioned myself on his back, and put his flabby neck into a full Nelson.  

Across the room the old farmer stood facing the grotesque thing that was supposed to be a woman.  The fibers wrapped around him sizzled and withered to the ground.  Three bullet holes in his shirt, unbothered as black and white hornets crawled from inside his torso, a few at first, then more.  

With a dismissive wave of his hand, hundreds of hornets erupted from the holes in his side, like an ancient glacial dam breaking, a torrent of flapping dots coalescing into a stream, landing on the woman, covering her face, her profane mound, her chest.  Her arm tried to brush away the bugs, only to be covered like moving sprinkles on an ice cream cone.  

Fibers shot wildly, blindly ripping through the air, each one in turn covered in yet more of the black and white wasps.  

My hold on Moe slackened as I watched.  He surged to buck me off.  I stood, shoving his head down and kicked him as hard as I could in crotch, took a few steps and kicked him in the head.  He lay still save for a snoring gurgle.

The woman thing, coated by hornets, collapsed to the ground.  The room fell silent save for the deafening buzz of thousands upon thousands of insect wings and the mastication of mandibles as the creatures stung and bit and chewed.

Clayton lay prone several paces away.  I left Moe’s piled form and ran to him.  His breath shallow, hands clutching inward.

“Clay!  Clay!  We’re gonna get help, hold on!”

Kneeling, I found two bullet holes in his chest, my hand covered them, blood leaking through my fingers.  I looked for a phone somewhere in the room.

“There’s dignity in the transition son,” the old man stood at Clayton's feet.

“Find a phone!  Call 911!” I yelled.

“Don’t use ‘em.  This life is but a probationary state.”  

He knelt, touched both of Clayton’s feet.  Clayton’s breath stopped.  Silence returned but for the chewing and buzzing bugs.

“He’s a martyr now, son.  Embraced and blessed by the gift of the Lord,” the old man said, a yellow jacket crawling out of nostril and into the other.

“What are you?” I asked, adrenaline wearing off.  I felt cold.  Clayton still felt warm.

“I can never enter the Kingdom of Heaven, so I worship the King on Earth.  They call me Rathdrum now.”

“Like the town?”

“I never been.”

Moe stirred, then didn’t.  A wretched flabby breath, then silence.

Buzzing from the stairs, a ball of swarming hornets and yellow jackets returned to the man thing called Rathdrum, turning like a tumbleweed in the air.  Rathdrum held out an outstretched palm and the swarm parted over it.  Moe’s numbered triangles fell into his palm.  He turned it over, considering it.

“I was at Jacobugath when it burned.  Some Commonist dabbler don’t mean never mind.”

“I don’t understand,” I said.

He stood, placing a wrinkled, liver spot hand on my shoulder.  Cold vibration through my jacket.  I looked up and he smiled, alternating black and yellow teeth.  

I looked to the thing that had been the woman, what had Moe called her?  Darja?  She was nothing but wet bones, coiled fibers, and bloody hair.

“What was she?”

“A wayward.  ‘...atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God.’”

“She…she was human?”  I asked.

“Used to be.  Some aren’t.  Lost.  I suppose.  Worthy of forgiveness.  You can hold your own in a fight.  Some have some use for a man like you.  A pious man.”

His hand still on me, he raised his other hand toward the bar.  Hornets and yellow jackets carried the pitcher of ice water to his hand.  He took it, sloshing its half-melted contents above my head.

“Brother Young, having been commissioned of The Christ, I baptize you for and in behalf of Darja, Witch of Tambov, who is dead, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

Ice water hit my face, ice cubes bombarding my eyes.  The cold shock hitched my breath, and I inhaled some involuntarily.  I collapsed and coughed, nearly retching again onto the stained carpet.

When I looked up Rathdrum was gone.  Clayton’s body lay prone beside a barely breathing Moe. 

I leaned against a wall, warm tears mixing with cold water.  I reached into my back pocket for my handkerchief, tucked beside it was a small black and white comic book.  Something about dark dungeons, written by someone named Jack.  A phone number scrawled on the back.

Somewhere in the distance I heard shouting.  Boots on the floor.  A man’s voice.  Men’s voices.  A light.

“Sheriff’s Department!”  I think one said.

I gazed into the light.  A revolver hovered beside it.  

“What the fuck happened here?”  I think the revolver said.

I couldn’t explain it.  So I said the only thing I could think of.

“We…were going to play…Dungeons and Dragons…”
