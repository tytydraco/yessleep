I never believed in ghosts, not until I moved into the old house on Stonybrook Lane. From the outside, it was the epitome of charm—a postcard-perfect home nestled in a quiet neighborhood, where the sun-dappled leaves of towering oak trees swayed in the breeze. A white picket fence framed a sprawling garden filled with roses, their sweet fragrance mingling with the earthy scent of freshly mown grass. The house itself, with its soft blue shutters and ivy-covered walls, seemed to smile, inviting me in.

But that inviting warmth began to fade as the sun dipped below the horizon.

It started on the fourth night. I was lying in bed, drifting between wakefulness and sleep, when I heard it—a faint, melodic sound drifting through the walls. It was a lullaby, soft and sweet, like the notes of a music box winding down. The melody was so delicate, it felt like it was brushing against my skin, leaving a trail of goosebumps in its wake.

At first, I thought it must be coming from a neighbor’s house, perhaps a child’s bedtime routine. But when I opened my window, the cool night air rushed in, carrying with it only the distant rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of a cricket. The lullaby persisted, floating on the edge of hearing, impossible to pinpoint.

The next night, the lullaby returned, more distinct this time, as if it were seeping through the very walls of the house. The melody was achingly beautiful, each note resonating deep within my chest, pulling at something buried in my memory, something I couldn’t quite grasp. It was comforting, yet there was an undercurrent of sadness that made my throat tighten.

Determined to find the source, I grabbed a flashlight and followed the sound up to the attic. The stairs creaked under my weight, each step echoing in the stillness. The attic door was stiff, as if it hadn’t been opened in years, and when I finally forced it open, the hinges groaned in protest.

The attic was a cavernous space, filled with the scent of dust and forgotten time. Cobwebs hung like delicate curtains from the rafters, and the air was thick with the musty odor of old wood. Pale moonlight filtered through a single, grimy window, casting long shadows across the floor. I swept the beam of my flashlight across the room, revealing sheet-draped furniture and boxes stacked haphazardly in the corners.

And there, near the far wall, was a small wooden rocking chair, gently swaying back and forth. The movement was almost imperceptible, like the last breath of a dying breeze. My heart pounded in my chest as I approached it, the lullaby growing louder with each step. The chair seemed to beckon me, its worn wood glowing faintly in the moonlight.

I reached out to touch the chair, but as my fingers brushed against the cool wood, the lullaby abruptly stopped. The silence that followed was thick and oppressive, pressing down on me like a weight. The rocking chair stood still now, its movement stilled as if caught in the act of something sinister.

I backed away, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps, and hurried out of the attic, slamming the door shut behind me. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, the product of an overactive mind and a strange old house. But deep down, I knew there was something more—something wrong.

Over the next few days, the lullaby became a nightly ritual, starting at precisely midnight. It no longer whispered at the edges of my hearing; now, it filled the house, weaving through the walls, the floors, the very air. The melody was no longer soothing—it was mournful, dripping with sorrow and anger. The rocking chair, always in the same place in the attic, swayed more violently each night, the creaking of its joints a discordant counterpoint to the lullaby’s haunting tune.

Sleep eluded me. Every time I closed my eyes, the lullaby would start again, louder, more insistent, until it was the only thing I could hear. It was as if the melody had burrowed into my mind, becoming a part of me. My nerves were frayed, and the shadows in the house seemed to stretch and twist into shapes that mocked me.

I needed answers. I scoured the town’s archives, desperate to find something—anything—that would explain the haunting. It wasn’t long before I stumbled upon the story of Mrs. Greer, the previous owner. She had lived in the house for over fifty years, a kindly old woman who was beloved by the neighborhood children. She would sing them lullabies as she rocked them to sleep, her voice as gentle and comforting as a warm blanket on a cold night.

But Mrs. Greer had died in that very attic, alone and forgotten. Her body was found sitting in the rocking chair, a sad smile on her lips, as if she had simply fallen asleep and never woken up. The official report said she died of old age, but there were whispers that she had died of a broken heart, abandoned by the children who had grown up and moved away.

The thought of Mrs. Greer’s lonely demise sent a chill down my spine. I realized then that the lullaby wasn’t just a melody—it was her voice, reaching out from beyond the grave, a desperate attempt to be remembered, to be acknowledged.

One night, unable to endure the torment any longer, I climbed back up to the attic. The rocking chair was thrashing violently now, as if caught in a storm, the wood groaning and splintering under the force. The lullaby was deafening, each note a sharp, jagged edge slicing through the air. I screamed at it to stop, to leave me alone, but the music only swelled, drowning out my voice.

In a fit of desperation, I lunged at the chair and threw it against the wall. The wood shattered on impact, pieces scattering across the floor like the fragments of a shattered memory. For a moment, there was blessed silence. I stood there, panting, heart racing, my mind struggling to comprehend what I had just done.

But the silence didn’t last.

The lullaby returned, softer this time, but more insidious. It wasn’t coming from the attic anymore—it was inside me, resonating in my bones, my blood, my very soul. I felt a cold, clammy hand grip my shoulder, and when I turned, there was nothing but darkness. Yet the sensation of that icy touch remained, seeping into my skin, chilling me to the core.

A voice, barely more than a whisper, slithered into my ear: “You broke my chair.”

The lullaby swelled, filling my mind with a cacophony of sorrow and rage, and I felt my grip on reality begin to slip. The walls of the attic seemed to close in around me, the shadows growing darker, more oppressive, until they consumed everything.

The next morning, a neighbor found me lying at the bottom of the attic stairs, trembling and muttering incoherently. They said my eyes were wild, darting around as if searching for something only I could see. I was taken to the hospital, where the doctors found nothing physically wrong with me, but I knew better.

I knew the lullaby had taken root deep within me, a curse that would never let go.

I moved out of that house as soon as I could, but it didn’t matter. The lullaby followed me, a spectral melody that haunted my every waking moment. I hear it in the quiet hours of the night, in the spaces between thoughts, in the silence that lingers after a conversation. It grows louder every day, its mournful tune winding tighter and tighter around my mind, until I can no longer tell where it ends and I begin.

I’m writing this because I don’t know how much longer I can endure it. The lullaby is driving me to the edge, and I fear that soon, I’ll join Mrs. Greer in her eternal vigil. If you ever hear a soft, lilting tune in the dead of night, run. Don’t look back. Don’t try to understand it.

Because once you hear the lullaby of Stonybrook, it never stops.
