**Have you ever had a recurring dream?**

I mean the kind of dream you’ve had since you were little, and that every now and then, somehow, returns. It’s like watching the same movie over and over again—you know how it starts, what happens in the middle, and how it ends. Sometimes, even while asleep, you're aware of the dream as it unfolds, like some strange form of déjà vu.

Since I was very young, I’ve had a recurring dream that comes and goes in phases. It’s so vivid in my memory that I often go to bed afraid I’ll see it again. I’m not sure what it means. I’ve heard that recurring dreams—especially those that play out the same way—might be tied to unresolved issues in real life.

But honestly, what do I know? I’m only 23, and I’ve never experienced anything in waking life that resembles what happens in that dream. Some psychologists say that the more you repeat the same dream, the more it morphs into a nightmare. And for as long as I can remember, this particular dream has always felt like one. From the very first time, I knew it was something dark.

Not many people know this about me, but my parents noticed something strange about me when I was little. They say that when I was around four years old, I used to wake them in the middle of the night, terrified, claiming I saw pale faces staring at me from within my bedroom.

On more than one occasion, I pointed out a little girl with cinnamon-colored skin who came to play with me at night. That detail really frightened them. They say I would talk to myself in the dark, pleading with that girl to leave, telling her I didn’t want to play.

I don’t remember that stage of my life clearly—who does at four years old? But I suppose something like that could leave a lasting mark. I never really gave those visions much importance. On top of that, my parents are very religious, so they paid close attention to everything I told them and would often pray over me, which brought me some peace—at least for a while.

I don’t know if I’m sensitive to those kinds of things, but I’ve had so many experiences in my life that people might label as “paranormal.”

Anyway, that’s not really what I want to talk about. What I’ve wondered for years is whether all of that—the visions, the girl, the prayers—has anything to do with the dream. Especially now that it’s begun to change in ways that deeply disturb me.

I first had the dream when I was about six years old. Since then, it has reappeared occasionally throughout my life. It always starts in the same way: I’m in a dark, silent room. I know it’s a room in a house because I can feel that I’m sitting on one of those thick, fuzzy carpets that were popular in bedrooms during the ’90s and early 2000s.

As I said, there’s total silence at first. But then, a light flickers on. It comes from an enormous TV set, sitting less than two meters from me in the corner of the room. That’s when I notice the walls are stark white, and there are no windows.

The screen is full of static, and then... the sounds begin—those cursed sounds I’ve never been able to forget, the ones I dread every time I have this nightmare. They’re not quite cries, but that’s the closest word I can find. It’s like deep, mechanical wailing—painful moans distorted as if coming from a synthesizer or some strange machine.

The closest thing I can compare them to is the way characters "speak" in the game *Faith: The Unholy Trinity*. (Incidentally, when I played that game for the first time, I nearly screamed. The sounds were *exactly* like the ones in my nightmare.)

The cries grow louder, building and building, until suddenly they stop. That’s when the grotesque images start flashing across the screen. One after another—twisted, horrifying images that seem ripped from the deepest corners of my subconscious.

These images have changed over time. I don’t remember what they looked like when I was six, but I do know that, as I grew up, they often mirrored the fears I had during different parts of my childhood.

Monsters, scenes of violence, depictions of hell, impossible figures, children crying… all of that and more, shown one after another, burning themselves into my mind.

What’s strange is that, no matter how hard I try to look away in the dream, the TV moves—impossibly—toward whichever corner I turn to. If I try to shut my eyes, it doesn’t matter. Even with my eyelids closed, I can still *see* the screen.

I remember that, at first, I tried to unplug the damn thing. But it didn’t work. The images would keep playing, and I’d be forced to watch again and again. And just like that, the volume would return, so loud it felt like my ears were going to explode. That’s usually when I’d wake up, drenched in sweat.

Like I said, I’ve had this dream countless times. The images on the screen may change, but the fear always remains the same. I’ve learned that, when I relive familiar dreams, I can usually anticipate what’s coming and wake myself up before things get too scary. But with *this* dream, that doesn’t work.

Years ago, I gave up. Every time the TV turned on, I’d just brace myself. I stopped trying to unplug it. I knew that if I endured it, eventually it would end.

But something changed about a year ago. In May 2024, I had the dream again. I expected it to unfold the same as always. But for some reason, I decided to try unplugging the TV again. In the dream, I reached behind the screen to pull the power cord—and that’s when it happened. **Something grabbed my hand.**

For the first time ever, I woke up before the nightmare reached its usual conclusion. That moment—that *touch*—shook me to the core. After all those years of seeing the same thing, the fact that *something changed* terrified me.

I thought about it for days. And every time I remembered the feeling of that hand, it seemed strangely familiar... but at the same time, it filled me with pure dread.

What scared me even more is that, after that night, the dream stopped. In the past, the longest I ever went without it was about five months. But this time? Nothing. Not until a few days ago.

That’s why I’m writing this—my hands shaking as I glance around my room.

A week ago, I had the nightmare again.

Everything started the same. I recognized the carpet. I waited for the TV to flicker on. I braced myself, wondering what horrors it would show me this time. But the screen stayed black.

I waited. Nothing.

And then I started to panic. I could *feel* the TV. The static, the hum of electricity in the room—it was there. But the screen wouldn’t light up.

So I moved toward it, feeling my way through the dark. I found it—cold, solid, just like always. I reached behind it, trying to find the power cable.

I was desperate. I can’t explain it, but something inside me *wanted* the TV to turn on. It was horrifying, yes, but familiar. There was some twisted comfort in knowing what was supposed to come next.

But there was no cable.

There was no outlet.

Frantic, I returned to where I’d been sitting. I was gasping, heart racing, surrounded by pitch blackness.

And that’s when I felt the hand again—grabbing mine in the dark.  
It felt... warm. Familiar. But it terrified me. A deep, ancestral fear that stirred memories I didn’t even know I had. Her cold fingers brought back flashes of a past I never fully understood.

Suddenly, the screen turned on, bathing the room in white light.

And I saw her.

The woman holding my hand had cinnamon-colored skin. Her face was covered in burns and held together by black stitches. Her eyes had no pupils—but I *knew* she was staring right at me.

She smiled. That awful, knowing smile—as if she was waiting for *me* to smile back.

I woke up soaked in sweat. My heart pounding. I jumped into a cold shower because my skin felt like it was burning.

I’m writing this a few days later. I’ve set alarms to wake me up every two hours so I don’t dream long enough to return to that place.

Because I know she’s still there, waiting me to play together.

And once again—I don’t want to play with her.
