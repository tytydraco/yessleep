The government was looking for test subjects for their new experiment of death, offering the victims a check of 1000000 dollars. I am struggling financially, and I thought it would be the best decision to apply. Surprisingly, I was chosen, but I felt concerned when I was told that only me and one other person had applied. So there we were, in some laboratory, in these uncomfortable capsules. I wondered if this was the right decision, but my thoughts were interrupted when one of the scientists spoke up, "The experiment will proceed as so: You will be given a formula which will kill you, almost entirely, apart from one, very small part of your brain, which will help us bring you back to life after 24 hours. In the meantime, you will bring back to us whatever information you have in the time that you died. Do you both wish to proceed?" I thought for a moment, before I agreed. My wife and kids could really use the money that we will earn, plus, I'm curious. The other guy backed out, but I don't really blame him.

Not long after, the experiment begun. I felt one of the worst pains in my life as this formula was injected into my body, making me scream in agony, Thankfully, it didn't last too long, but that's when I blacked out. It felt like an eternity later, I woke up in this bright place. I squinted, and my eyes widened. Heaven was real. It's actually real. I looked around for a moment, before approaching the gate. I didn't see any kind of God, but I did see some guardian angel looking creatures. Everyone had these huge, almost impossible smiles on their faces as they greeted me. I noticed that some of them had tears running down their face, which honestly confused me. Surely they can't be that happy, right?

I looked down, and in fact, we could see our loved ones, in this portal looking surface. I saw my wife driving my kids to school, and I smiled, wishing I could be down there with them. After wondering around for a bit, I noticed that I had developed one of those smiles. It wasn't too forced, but I found it slightly strange. I approached one of the guardians, and asked, "Is there concept of time here?" He looked at me, and shook his head. Wait, that would technically mean that by the time I was brought back, I would've been here forever, since time is going to be completely different. The thought alarmed me slightly, but that wouldn't be so bad, I supposed.

A few "hours" in, or what it felt like, I was starting to panic. But for some reason, the emotion was trapped inside of me. All I could do was smile. I was loosing my shit on the inside. There is nothing here, only smiling angels and clouds. It feels like there's some sort of barrier when it comes to talking to the others, a similar feeling to when you're trying to run or scream in a dream and you can't. 

I feel like I have been here foe eternity. I am going absolutely insane. I don't know how long it's been, because every time I look back down, I see my wife driving my kids. The image hasn't changed, even though it's been so long since the last time I checked. The saying of Heaven making you only feel happiness is quite literal, as it's the reason why none of us can stop smiling, and why most of us are crying. It's forcing us, and our real emotions are trapped in here. 

I later found out, that Hell does not exist, only something much worse. Those who would normally "go to Hell", are sent to the Endless Void. You have to sit there, in nothingness, forever. It's not even complete darkness, or space, it's just... nothing. If my experience is this bad, I don't even want to imagine what the Endless Void must feel like. It made my mind and stomach twist.

I can't even estimate how long it has been anymore, before suddenly, everything went blank. Did I just get send to the Endless Void? I thank everything out there when I woke up in the capsule, screaming at the top of my lungs, and bashing on the glass desperately, as the scientists tried to calm me down.

I was sent to rehab for a few months, and was later seeing a therapist daily. It hasn't done much, but it's better than nothing. What I had experienced was worth no amount of money, and I'm absolutely terrified to die.

I guess the Endless Void screws with your mind more than you think, because no, I have not woken up. I was sent there.
