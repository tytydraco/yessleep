I've fucked up guys. I have to write this quick because I honestly don't know how much time I have left. I have to warn you all before you end up in a similar position as myself. Don't downvote shit on Reddit!!

I know, screw you, I'll do what I want. I was like you. I gleefully downvoted every story, comment, link and picture I didn't like because it always have me that feeling of superiority. I'm better than you, so my opinion of your opinion is you shouldn't have one, so shut up. If I didn't like a redditor's name, DOWNVOTE! If their story was ok but I saw the ending coming, down arrow that bitch! You say something that I disagree with despite proving with links and evidence you're right, ok smarty-pants enjoy your DOWNVOTE! 

I won't lie, yes I'm a hateful person. In person I'm the one at the office everyone avoids. They know not to come to me with their charity birthday collections or boohooing stories about Jessica in accounting who's cat had surgery and she's hurting for money. I don't care, AT ALL. Other people's problems aren't MY problems, you should have planned better! I'm so tired of the whining and the "why are you so mean Erica?" bs. I'm mean because I don't care what people think of me. It was easy being me, I didn't have to worry what people thought of me, they hated me and I couldn't give a rat's ass about it. I never thought being myself on bloody Reddit would be my downfall, but here we are. 

It started a few nights ago. I was having my third IPA and enjoying reading horror stories and doing my favorite thing, downvoting. Every little arrow that took that person's number down gave me a thrill. When I felt a stabbing pain in the pinkie toe on my right foot, I didn't think about it much at first. I kept doing what I do until it felt like a searing pain. I then took off my sock and my toe was black, swollen and seeping pus. I screamed and called an Uber to the local emergency room. They said I likely got bit by a brown recluse, and unfortunately they couldn't save the toe. I hurled insults at them and threw my phone at the doctor's head, but they just restrained me and sedated me and I woke up the next day minus two toes. 

They told me it had spread and they had to take the second one. Before I could build my anger up to a head the nurse pushed another sedative into my IV and I calmed down. As my world got fuzzy again I thought to myself as nice as this feels I'm still gonna sue these fuckers the second I get out. I woke up a few hours later and my phone was beside me on the table, a crack in the screen from my earlier tantrum. 

I decided I needed to get this rage out of my system but I clearly couldn't do it here without getting drugged like some damn lab rat, so to the reddit app I went. A few stories I didn't even bother reading, a few off my chest posts telling people they are stupid and deserved it, and the pain was back. This time in both feet. I called the nurse (who was extremely slow to respond even though I screamed for them, lazy jerks) and told them the pain was back. They got the doctor and sure enough, the remaining toes on my right foot and three of the toes on my left were necrotic. WTF?!

Into surgery I went again, this time demanding to be discharged the second I cleared the anesthesia out of my system. Yes it was against doctor's orders but who cares?! They cut off my damn foot!! So I took another Uber back home (0 stars, dude wouldn't stfu) and climbed into bed, just grateful I lived on the first floor. When I woke up the next day I had missed work and been fired. Lovely. Those doctors aren't getting a penny, it can go on my damn credit report for all I care! So I go back to Reddit. I know what you're thinking, at this point I had to know something was up, I've read enough paranormal shit to make the connection by now, but I'm a true skeptic and I never believe anything those doofuses say, so no, I didn't make the connection. 

My left foot went necrotic and literally fell off my ankle like a smoked rib. Then I lost up to my calves. At this point I just knew I had a flesh eating bacteria but research made it clear nothing just makes your body parts fall off like this. It wasn't until both my legs were gone that I finally made the connection. I've deleted my hateful comments and stopped downvoting anything, but even deleting my reddit account didn't seem to reverse whatever this curse was. I created this account in the hopes of redeeming myself and maybe being able to keep what little is left of my wasting away body. 

Don't be like me, don't be a downvoter. That little adrenaline rush you get from shitting on other people's creativity just isn't worth it. I don't know who or what cursed me to die this way, or even why, I'm certainly not the only person on Reddit who does this shit and it's REALLY not fair, but that doesn't seem to matter either. Just be careful on this damn site. You don't want to end up like me. If you don't like something just...click away from it. This really sucks and if I could reverse whatever this is, I would. I would upvote everything and never make another nasty comment. It's too late for me but you can learn from my [mistakes. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Katerinara_Horror?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
