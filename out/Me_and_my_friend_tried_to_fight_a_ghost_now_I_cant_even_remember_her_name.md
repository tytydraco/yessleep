I’m in the house with a friend i don’t remember, the friend had a book it was important and old, brown and falling apart at the edges.

Where trying to stop a ghost that has been scaring some kids, my friend was the one who decided to do it, she always was the more out going and adventurous one.

Eventually we find the ghost,
Its old, Female, Grey hair and wears Dark clothes, a dress I think, the ghost tells us we’re free to leave,it lied.

Repeating rooms, no matter how far I run I’m still in the same living room, same yellow wall paper and leather arm chair with the front door leading back into this room.

Outdoors, I see the front yard I can see the road trough the next door way, it’s Fake, I know it is, the black cat on my left shoulder tells me as much.

Endless running but I’m not tired, I’m outside now running down the road on the green patches of grass meant for civilians to wait to cross the road I can’t stop running.

Cars swerving to hit me on the high way, I have to keep my attention on the roads surround me.

The first car comes from the back it’s black and small like my grandmothers but a different colour, I don’t see the driver and I run over to the other side of the road to avoid it.

The second comes from in front and is more blatant with its attempt to hit me, it’s a red car and like the last it’s windows have been blacked out.

The third vehicle narrowly misses with me now running on the grass on the highway.

I’m forced to fall on my back to avoid a truck that slide to halt with its tire 2 cm from my face, I didn’t see the window only the truck spinning to hit me.

I crawl out from under the truck, it was red, it had writing on it I didn’t read, I was to short to see the window, there’s a kid holding the black cat, the cat looks scared.

The boy asks me if I’ve had enough with a huge grin on his face, he was wearing a green t shirt and jeans, that probably wasn’t important but I’m writing all the detail I can remember.

I’m surprised I remember it over his grin, it’s a impossibly large grin too big for his face.

More running, I’m getting no where and start to wonder why I’m running then I pass the kid with his inhuman grin and I want nothing more then to be away from. 

I wake up in bed, my hart thumping, I grab my phone to write down my dream into my phone and send it to my friend who was in the dream with me

I can’t find her number or her text history, shortly after I realised there was no trace of her online and tried to write down everything I could remember about her, are text messages, her jokes, how she looked.

I can’t remember her name but I know my friend was real and I know where the house is, I just don’t know if I’ll ever go back in
