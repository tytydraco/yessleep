The first half-year grind at the dot-com was nothing but a smeared blend of pixel vomit and coffee stains on my desk. The gig was a no-brainer: polish the earth’s blemishes caught by peeping satellites, make the planet look less like a dumpster fire and more like a brochure for utopia. I was the definition of a drone, just another keystroke serf in the sprawling digital feudal system, or that's the script I followed until the so-called promotion dropped. "Promotion," they said, as if the word didn’t taste like stale air.


It happened on a Tuesday, the kind of day you wouldn't bother marking on a calendar, when my supervisor, Mr. Always-Too-Bright-Tie, pulled me aside. His office was a small, cluttered space, the kind that suggested work was always on the verge of being done but never actually progressing. His gaze could shrink you down or swell you up, depending on the second, spinning you between feeling like the chosen one and the office furniture. "You've been tapped," he declared, sporting a smile that seemed to die before it could fully take off. "Time to dive into the real game."


Real work, as it turned out, was a euphemism for digital censorship on a scale I hadn't imagined. My grand promotion, wrapped in the glittery foil of corporatese, was as director of erasing inconvenient truths. Plane nosedives, secret military playgrounds, anything that tickled the government's paranoia, was mine to make vanish. My tool of choice? Good ol’ Photoshop.


My first assignment was almost laughable in its directness. A plane crash. Not just any crash, but one that the news hadn't caught wind of, a ghost tragedy on an otherwise unblemished stretch of green and brown below. Coordinates in hand, a too-brief saga of mechanical failure, and a pat on the back sent me off. "Blanket it with clouds," they instructed. "Make it a non-event."


Sitting in front of my dual monitors, I couldn't help but feel like a god in a digital Eden, deciding what mortals could and couldn't see. The absurdity of it all tickled a dark part of my brain, a section I kept locked away for fear of what it might say about me. With a few clicks, I summoned clouds from the ether, crafting them with a meticulous care I hadn't known I possessed. Layer by layer, I erased the evidence of chaos, painting over the jagged, scorched earth and twisted metal with serene, fluffy white clouds. It was as if the plane, the passengers, their stories, had never existed. Gone, with a stroke of my hand.


Hunched over my twin screens, the glow casting my shadow like some digital-age deity, I couldn't shake this god-complex buzz. A buzz that hummed in the darker corners of my mind, where I keep the thoughts that scare me shitless about who I really am. With a flick here, a drag there, I'm pulling clouds out of thin air—digital smoke and mirrors—and I'm doing it with a kind of precision that feels alien in my hands. Layer by goddamn layer, I'm wiping the slate clean. The chaos, the wreck, the screaming metal and the stories—all just dust. Erased. Like they never even took a breath. All it took was a lazy swipe from yours truly.


Leaning back, the hum of the AC is the only thing trying to fill the void in my cubicle. On my screen, there's this calm, this eerie peace—a perfect lie. That's when it hits me, the weight of what I'm doing. I'm the one pulling the strings on what's real and what's bedtime stories for the masses. But as that high starts to wear off, there's this itch, this gnawing doubt creeping up my spine. The people on that plane, their stories—what the hell happened to them? Who were they before they became a job for me to erase?


"This is easy," they said. "Just another day," they said. But as I stare into the abyss of my screens, those mockingly tranquil clouds, I get this sinking feeling. No way back now.


On another day, just another tick in time, my boss yanks me back into his lair. The air's colder, biting, like the office is now more a reflection of our sordid deeds than a workspace. Pleasantries? Forget it. We're way past the niceties of normal job crap. "Big Gov's cooked up a fresh hell," he drops it like a lead balloon, his voice doing this dance between serious and scared shitless. "And you, my friend, are gonna help us shove it under the rug. All nice and neat."


Then he hit me with it—the visuals, a so-called routine satellite snap of where a teeming American city used to be. Now? It's just bones, an urban skeleton laid bare, a ghost of its former self. And my job? Slap a pretty picture over it. Turn this tomb into farmland.


As my boss spilled the beans, the story got darker. "Uncle Sam was playing mad scientist and botched it. Big time. Couldn't contain the beast they unleashed," he's stumbling over his words, trying to find a way to sugarcoat a catastrophe. Our eyes lock, filled with the dread of secrets too heavy to hold. "That city," he finally chokes out, "was a sacrifice."


The room starts to spin, walls inching closer, ready to crush me under the weight of stories that will never see the light of day. I'm no longer just the guy who tweaks pixels; I'm a silent partner in this conspiracy. With every click, I'm not just hiding the ugly scars left by our leaders' failures; I'm erasing existence itself.


There I am, parked in front of my screens, turning a mass grave into a picture-perfect postcard of farmland. The sheer absurdity of my task hits me like a freight train. I'm painting over the past, drawing wheat fields where children once played, sketching out calm blue skies where screams pierced the air, planting digital crops on ground soaked with unseen blood. Every stroke, every edited pixel, it's all a lie.


What had begun as a surreal, detached task had morphed into a haunting realization of my complicity in a conspiracy of silence. The city and its people, now hidden beneath layers of digital farmland, haunted me.


As weeks melded into a blur of digital deception, the weight of my task grew heavier, a relentless tide that threatened to drown me in its depths. The initial shock of erasing a city had faded into a grim acceptance, a resigned acknowledgment of the role I had been conscripted to play in this macabre theater. But nothing could have prepared me for the meeting that would shatter any remaining illusion of normalcy.


Summoned once again into the sterile confines of my supervisor's office, I was met with a somberness that chilled the air. The room now felt like a mausoleum, housing the ghosts of countless unspoken tragedies. Without preamble, my supervisor disclosed the grim reality that was our work.


"The world," he began, his voice barely a whisper, "is on the brink. We no longer have the resources to support the global population. Measures have been taken, decisions made that weigh heavily on us all." His eyes, haunted with the weight of secrets too burdensome to bear, met mine. "We've been tasked with 'removing' small, remote cities. It's already begun."


Then came the list, a roll call of the next to go, handed to me like a ticket to the end of the world. These names, these places, they weren't just coordinates on a digital grid; they were death sentences I was signing off on, premeditated obituaries for communities that still had no idea they were walking ghosts.


Start the cover-up early. Paint over the cracks before the world even knew they were there. Each stroke of my brush, a lie. Each saved file, a silent admission of our failure. This was our new normal, a reality where we were, deciding who got to stay on the map and who got turned into just another field of green in a world that had no room for them anymore.


Drowning in this knowledge, it's like being smothered by a blanket soaked in the darkest ink of despair. You ask yourself, how did we get here? How did we twist progress and prosperity into a sick game of planetary Russian roulette, blowing away entire cities with the cold, indifferent spin of a bureaucratic revolver? It's not just a few isolated freak accidents; it's a methodical massacre, a global game of eeny, meeny, miny, moe  where the losers vanish off the face of the earth.


Sitting back at my desk, that damn list staring me down, I'm swallowed by a void of loneliness so profound it's like I'm the last human left standing. Each name on that list, a whisper from the grave, telling tales of what might have been—histories never written, futures obliterated before they even had a chance to flicker into existence. For every city I'm tasked to erase, it feels like I'm choking the life out of the world's soul, erasing it bit by bit from the cosmic memory.


Embarking on this macabre mission, slathering fake pastoral scenes over the scars of our self-inflicted wounds, it's nothing short of sacrilege. These aren't canvases of hope I'm painting; they're tombstones, marking the graves of our collective conscience.


The revelation that humanity had chosen this path, that we had sanctioned the obliteration of the few to sustain the many, was a mirror reflecting the darkest facets of our nature. In the quiet of my office, amidst the ghostly glow of my screens, I grappled with the enormity of our actions. The cities, now just shadows beneath a digital veil, were a testament to our desperation, a grim monument to the lengths to which we would go to preserve our way of life.


In this new, harrowing role, I was not just an eraser of landscapes but a keeper of the most damning secret of our time. The knowledge that the world was culling its own, city by city, was a burden I would carry, a silent scream in the void of my conscience. And as I labored over my task, the lines between right and wrong blurred into insignificance, leaving only the haunting question: at what cost do we ensure our survival?
