Heya. I'm new to this subreddit and well to be fair I would like to share something that's been stuck in my head for long time.
Note this may seem like I'm venting or talking about my personal dramas but it gets strange real soon.


I remember back when I was 16 years old (24 years old )at the time my personal life was rather rough for a teenager just a lot hussle and really, really bad memories. 

During that period of time I was being abused emotionally and physically by my oldest sibling and ontop of that was left alone to look after many things at the house while mother was away in America. I didn't have anywhere to get away from all of the abuse nor I could talked about it to anyone as at the time my sister who was living alone was also pregnant at the time and she already faced an miscarriage before and on top of that my mother turned out to have cancer at the time so I couldn't really tell anyone or run to anyone from my personal problem at the time.

I remember this one time I had to get up and go to school, on this spot I want you to picture a park, bus stop near it and usually the streets are bustling with cars and life and people, I remember it was 1/2 pm and usually there were a lot of cars and traffic during that time period and especially people and kids since there's a school at the park.

Here where it gets strange, on this day for some reason there was no cars, no kids, no adults or anyone as if time has stopped for a moment or as if they stopped existing another fact the road is straight forward so you would be able to see any car that would pass you by, but for some reason nothing.
I had a strange feeling to turn my head to right and I see this strange old man, which  mind you I had not seen coming from any direction it is like this old guy spawned out of thin air middle of the road and walked towards me. He didn't seem drunk but he was really, really unusual person. During his walk he would spin in rather charismatic way and talk to me. I didn't say anything to him but he had me confused or wonder what is up with him. 
After the slow and gentle spin he did he faced me and asked "isn't life wonderful?" And smiled. I gave him like autistic stare didn't say anything and was kind of weirded out, and then suddenly bus arrived that is my bus. I entered and sat down on one of the seats and for some reason the old man tracked where I was sitting in the bus while him being outside.
He taps the window I was next too with his index finger and smiled at me.

After that day I never saw that old man again and never felt the streets being frozen in time. I asked myself if it was potential schizophrenia or something, but none of my family members haves these issues and I never had any sorts of episodes like these at all.

Anyway I don't know what I can say about that old man, but genuinely it's partially creepy or just unusual how it happened. Ever since then I been having sometimes strange dreams, one time I remember dreaming and meeting god, but from I saw how god looked like in his actual form it honestly terrified me and put me in partial deppresion when waking up. The figure of the being I could not really describe the looks of it and honestly wish experience it again. 

There's more to these things as I remember my own mother telling me she had to kept my identity hidden from certain family members due to fearing of them doing some sort of black magic and as well especially dad side.

Mind you I don't really believe in curses, or gods or anything which is funnier part. 


Although sometimes I do feel like I'm being watched, that old man really creeped me out when I look back at it and especially the unusual dreams that are either human sacrifices, torment by god or ominous being telling me their "truth".

One last thing I have to mention this all sounds like I've been traumatized by religion, but my mother isn't that crazed religious so I never was force feed bible studies or something.

I talked to my girlfriend about this and she jokingly said that I've been cursed by devil or something haha.
