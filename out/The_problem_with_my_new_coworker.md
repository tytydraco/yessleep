Greetings world, so apparently people share their supernatural experiences on here, so I thought I'd share mine.

Okay, so before I begin, let me start with some basic information. 

First of all, i've never been one for the supernatural. I'm not an active disbeliever, but I usually find myself doubting stories of demons or ghosts. However, I would also call myself a sensible person, so on the off chance that it is real, I try not to mess with those sorts of things. While other children would be saying 'bloody marry' or using a Ouija board, you'd find me upstairs eating a snack. The simple truth is, I don't think it's a good idea to mess with the supernatural.

If it isn't real, then it's pointless. And on the off-chance that it is real, I'd rather not poke it with a stick.

I also consider myself very good at spotting 'turn-around' points. For example, when I was ten I saw something in the lake at a summer camp I was attending. The camp was for kids who were starting to go blind, like me. I was one of the few there with usable sight left, and I swear I saw something in the water of that lake. It was dark, big, and looked dangerous. It could have been a large catfish for all I know, but I felt a shiver up the back of my spine that kept me firmly out of the water for the rest of the camp. I refused to touch the lake, regardless of punishment, out of that fear. The part of my brain that says 'turn-around' has always been a part I listen to.

  
Now, for a minor additional detail, I have a job at my local gas station. I would mostly be a cashier, and janitor, for the place. This was fine for me, even blind you just have to clean entire sections, and working a cash register is easy with certain accommodations. So, I suppose that brings us to the elephant in the room, I am blind. Being blind means that I have to trust in my other senses, my hearing, my touch. This often means I can mistake things for other things, or get scared of what doesn't exist. Once, for example, I mistook my mother using our mother doing some maintenance on our lawnmower as a growling dog.

  
So yeah, I recently acquired a co-worker on my shift. His job is just to maintain the shelves, make sure people who need assistance can get gas, and do all the stuff I won't do. It's just the two of us, working that 6 hour shift, every day, including weekends. I don't know why he works all week, I do so because I have nothing better to do. His name was Joe, and we worked together.

It has been a week since Joe started working with me, but something is off about him. He is incredibly quiet, and doesn't speak unless spoken to. This has become a bit of a problem for me, since I can only detect him when the gas station is quiet and I hear him moving and breathing. To mention ages, I'm about 20, whereas he, i'm told, is 23. 

We rarely talk, and even then its usually nothing but a quick exchange of sentences started by me. I'll yell out 'JOE!' here him say 'yeah?' from somewhere around the store, and ask him either to do something, help me with something, or help a customer. He rarely says more to me than 'of course' and 'I'll do that for you'. His voice is quiet and thin, often as low as a whisper. He really doesn't make it easy on me to find him in the store, but I try.

The way I met him was my boss showing up the evening of my shift and saying "This is joe, he's going to be working with you Marcus'. I've worked this shift alone for a year now so I wondered why he was there and I asked her. 'Well, we need someone to cover for those areas where you're weak', was her main reason. I accepted this, I had always had trouble with customer service and stocking the shelves.

His first day was fine, I showed him around, my white cane tapping across the linoleum as I showed him the back room, the shelves, and the bathroom. It was his second when things got weird.

I was standing at the cash register, when I felt a shiver down my spine. Now I haven't gotten such a feeling in a while, and the place wasn't busy at this time (I work late-evenings into the night), so I thought on it. I remembered that time at camp, when I had felt this feeling, and I tried to figure out what was triggering it. That's when I detected it.

Behind me, there was the faintest sound of breathing. I turned around quickly and asked:

"Joe?"

There was a long pause, of the same breathing, before I got my response.

"Yeah?" Joe said quietly from right in front of me.

I spun my white-cain forward, bumping it into his legs to figure out his distance from me. He was standing about 1.5-2feet away. And before you ask me how I can judge such a distance, you get really good at that stuff when you can't physically see the distance.

I then said to Joe:

"How long have you been standing there?"

"30 minutes" came the quiet reply.

That was creepy right? Look, I don't know about you, but someone standing behind you while you stood at a cash register for 30 minutes is very creepy. I responded somewhat nervously:

"Don't you have something better to do?"

His response?

"No. I finished all my tasks."

I really had nothing to say to this, so I just responded with "Then head to the back, I'm going to keep working".

I didn't hear a response, but I did hear the light-tapping of his footsteps. Now, most of the time Joe's footsteps sound like a normal person's. The casual clump of rubber, or leather, or whatever is on the bottom of your shoes against linoleum. They did not sound like that this time, it was an odd, 'Splat' sound. Have you even walked barefoot in your kitchen? That was the sound it made. Rather than the mute of shoes, this was a weirder sound.

I didn't think a lot of it at the time, but really, this should've been my first clue that something was up. I was just too weirded out by the idea of him watching me for 30 minutes to think of the sound of his feet.

The next shift was really busy, so there wasn't really that much creepy-ness. I did meet an old woman named Pamela who spoke to me at the register for a solid 30 minutes, that was nice. It was the next shift that something strange happened.

I was cleaning around our freezer section with a mop, when I heard the tapping sound of shoes behind me. Turning around I said:

"Joe?"

There was no pause this time, it was almost immediate.

"Yeah?"

It was too close. As if he was directly in my face, but in order to do that he would've had to lean way forward and said it near my ears. Which apparently he did. This sudden feedback made me jump, because normally I have to strain my ears to be able to hear him. I jumped, slipped on the soapy water, and fell over
 I crashed onto the floor. I was slightly dazed for a second, but luckily I hadn't hit my head. I heard from above me:

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm okay, ow..." was my response from the floor. I felt a hand touch mine as Joe moved to help me up, but I moved my other hand to grasp his, and I bumped his shoulder with my hand. His skin was cold, like incredibly cold, and oily as if he was sweating a lot. The weirdest part was, his shoulder wasn't covered by cloth, it was bare. Now this could mean many things, he could simply be wearing unexpected clothing, like a wife-beater, or the like. It's not like gas-station employees are known for our fashion sense. But he quickly backed away from me as I touched him. Like we was afraid of me bumping into the rest of his body.

He moved so fast that I lost my grip on his hand, and I had to steady myself on the nearby shelves. It hurt slightly,

"Ow" I muttered again.

Additionally, I had that chill again, that feeling of "something is not right". Now my usual, and understandable response to this feeling is to leave the area, and never return. The only problem was, this was my work, my employment. It had taken me awhile to get this job, and I wasn't going to give it up because of a weird feeling and a co-worker who behaved oddly.

"Thanks for that." I said, trying to both thank Joe for helping me up, and reprimand him for letting go so rapidly.

All I heard was the sounds of his shoes vanishing.

The next two days passed by. I could tell you of other weird things. Like the time I heard running water in the break-room for an entire hour and when I asked Joe about it, all he said was: "It's my clothes, I'm washing them". Or the time I passed him as I entered the bathrooms and he said: "Try not to be a stranger," as I walked past his pattering steps.

I could even tell you of the three separate occasions I would be in the store at a quiet moment, and I would hear breathing behind me. I would always ask:

"Joe?"

The response was always:

"Yeah?"



In the end, the thing that got me to quit, the moment that made me post this rambling story, was a simple thing. He started to touch me, and when I explain, you'll understand that something supernatural was happening.

It was towards the end of my shift last night, I was simply trying to figure out where the broom was in the closet off of the store, when I heard a patter behind me. Not the clunk of shoes, it was again the sound of pair feet on linoleum. I turned around, as I felt something tap my clothed shoulder.

Joe said my name, much louder than he normally did, it almost sounded like normal speaking volume. 

"Marcus?"

My response was simple:

"Yeah?"

His next words sent that same chill up my spine that had started to become a more common presence in my life.

"Don't move". He said quietly, as I felt his hand move onto my shoulder. It was that same cold, slimy, thing, though it felt wrong somehow. Almost like it was dead flesh, or maybe that was just me panicking at the situation.

His other hand moved onto my other shoulder, and began to caress it, his voice was that same 'loud' as before. Finally he spoke at a normal volume.

"I like you. You can't see the problems."

I was too terrified to be offended, though in hindsight I am offended. What? I get liked because I am Blind? I didn't know he was ableist.

"What problems?" I responded.

"Shhh. It's nothing." I felt his hands grip my shoulders tighter, and I felt something press against my stomach.

Thinking now, it could have been his foot or leg. Perhaps he contorted himself into an odd position so he could touch my stomach while keeping two hands on my shoulders. But I don't believe that. I swear he had a third hand, touching my stomach, with long fingers.

This was the final straw, I heard him start to say something, but I was already lifting my white-cane.

For those of you who don't know, white canes are not sturdy. Not even a little bit, they are less good than a solid tree-branch in my opinion as a weapon. Mine was slightly better, made of a thin metal and a fold-able design. Many solid-white canes are not foldable, and are made of fiberglass. Which, while light and easy to carry, makes for a terrible weapon.

My cane however, managed to hit his face. I had aimed, for where the sound of his voice was coming from. and I had hit him.

He let out a grunt, and I could feel his hands loosen slightly. I don't know why, but I simply took this moment to shove forward with my body, pushing outward against him. I don't know how strong he is, but I managed to shove him off me, and I moved for the door.

I did not, in fact, move towards the door quickly. I was disoriented, I could feel my cane was broken, and I needed to find the exit. I heard him quietly behind me, as I moved away.

"Aww... that's okay". He then made a shushing noise. "Shhh... Shhhh... It will all be okay, I will talk to you, later."

His voice sounded almost... infantilizing? Fetishistic? I don't know how to to put it other than that it creeped me out. Eventually I found the door and just started running parallel to the side of the road, using the sound of traffic to guide me.

Next to the gas station, was a large corn field, so I simply followed along the edge of it until I was too tired to run. Then, using my cell-phone, and the software known as a Screen-reader, and talk-back, I called an Lyft, and made it home. I emailed my notice of quitting to me boss, the reason? Harassment.

  
I don't know if Joe was supernatural or not. The third hand could've been anything really. I'm just a scared guy, writing this post in my room. It's a rambling, badly edited, mess, that I'm not even going to proof read. I doubt you all can help me, unless you can somehow identify who, or what, Joe was. In short, I'm just telling you of my problem. 

It may have been supernatural, and you guys are apparently experts on that stuff. If you know what Joe was, or have seen him, let me know. I'm not going to reveal where the gas station is, simply because it is within walking-distance of my home, and I don't want to accidentally Dox myself.

Thank you for reading.
