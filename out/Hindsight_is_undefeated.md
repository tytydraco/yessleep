When I was 11 years old, I saw my brother accidentally kill himself. We were hiking in Turner Falls, a popular hiking spot in Oklahoma. We were on an unfamiliar trail high up in the mountains. He was always trying to show me up as an older brother would. Going off the trail and taking risky downhill shortcuts or walking backwards to talk his shit to me. None of that is what got him killed though. He fell off a tree and landed on his neck. The snap I heard was either the branch he broke or his spine but my ears twitch at just the sight of a twig. I relive this moment almost every night in my dreams. You’re probably wondering if this story is real or just another bullshit ass reddit post made to farm internet clout. Don’t get it twisted though, I appreciate a good story, real or not, but this isn’t some typed on the spot fabrication. This hasn’t left my mind. This happened. 	

I knew right away he was dead but I couldn’t fully process what that meant. I just fell to my knees and stayed there staring at my brother's corpse for what felt like an hour. Ultimately, I had to hike back down and try to communicate to my mother what happened. Through my uncontrollable sobs and lack of breath I told her my brother had been in an accident and that he was still on the trail. It’s a brain altering moment having to see your brother's nose smash against his own chest but it’s just as traumatic seeing your mother scream her lungs out at the sight of her son’s stiff corpse. 

After the camping trip got cut short my parents immediately signed me up for weekly psychiatric and therapeutic visits. The therapy focused on controlling my survivors' guilt and later transition to quieting the recurring nightmares. The treatment worked as well as it could’ve but even now I struggle shaking the part I played in his death. Maybe if I had talked him down from the tree, maybe if I had told him he was being a fucking idiot. Maybe if I had picked a different trail or even a different camping spot. I know none of this matters anymore and that wasn’t anything I could’ve done at that moment. Mom felt the same way before she passed. Blaming herself for his death. Blaming herself for the way I turned out. Hindsight is undefeated. But all the anxiety exercises and medication can help the resurfacing guilt once I’m asleep. How can I move on when he visits me almost every night?

I’ve come to involuntarily lucid dreams when I see him now. He’ll sit at the foot of my bed waiting till I escape the mental bindings of my sleep. He’ll look exactly like I remember him that day, dead eyes and all. We’ll have conversations about mom or school or anything else we talked about on the trail leading up to the moment it happened. While it frightened me at first I’ve grown fond of the moments we share now. When I haven't been seeing him lately I just transport myself to the very evening our life ended. I remember that cloudy Saturday afternoon. The exact tree he was climbing, the shoes he was wearing, even his bent neck I haven’t been able to forget. I remember the light of his eyes flicking off when his head met the dirt. Seemingly no amount of therapy has a cure for this. The breathing exercises don’t work as well when you’re asleep. Distinguishing reality from my dreams has become exhausting and I’m just so fucking tired.
My brother died of an accident, my mother died of stress and all I want is to see them again. It's becoming gradually harder to lie to myself. Escaping the memories that are keeping me prisoner has become impossible if I can relive them. It just hit me that posting this fills a bottomless pit. The internet can’t do anything more than several therapists have already tried. But thanks for listening yall, maybe i’ll see ya around soon.
