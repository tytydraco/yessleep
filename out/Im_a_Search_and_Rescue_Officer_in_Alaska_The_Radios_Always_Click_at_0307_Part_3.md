Night four.

The station feels wrong in a way I can't articulate. The fluorescent lights hum at a frequency that makes my teeth ache. The coffee tastes like copper. When I walked in for my shift, Morrison looked up from his desk, smiled, and went back to his paperwork without saying a word. Not unusual, except Morrison always asks about the weather. Always. For three years, every single shift: "How's it looking out there, Harper?"

Today, nothing.

Dale's at his desk, typing with mechanical precision. His posture is too straight, his movements too measured. I tried to talk to him when I came in, asked him if he wanted to grab lunch later. He looked at me with eyes that didn't quite focus and said, "I don't know you." Then he went back to typing.

The headache is constant now. A thick, pulsing pressure behind my eyes that makes the edges of my vision blur. When I blink, I sometimes see afterimages of things that aren't there. A tall figure standing in the corner. A hand reaching for my shoulder. The shape of someone's face pressed against the window, watching.

I've been staring at the same incident report for twenty minutes. The words keep sliding off the page.

At 14:37, my phone rang.

I didn't recognize the number, but the area code was local. I almost didn't answer. My hand was shaking when I picked up.

"Harper?" The voice was tight with fear. Thomas Aqpik. "I need to talk to you. Not at the station. Can you meet me?"

"Thomas, what's wrong?"

"Not on the phone." His breathing was ragged. "The old fish camp, north of town. The one by Otter Creek. You know it?"

I did. Abandoned for years, just a few rotting shacks on the ice.

"I'll be there in thirty minutes."

"Come alone," he said. Then, quieter: "I'm being followed."

The line went dead.

I grabbed my coat and keys. Auntie was at the dispatch desk when I passed, her fingers moving across the keyboard with that same unnatural fluidity. She looked up as I walked by, her smile too wide, showing too many teeth.

"Going somewhere, dear?"

"Routine patrol."

"In the middle of your shift?" Her head tilted, just slightly. The same angle the Walker had used. "You should rest, Benjamin. You look so tired."

"I'm fine."

"Are you?" She stood up, moving around the desk toward me. I backed toward the door. "You've been having such a hard time lately. The headaches. The confusion. Sarah told me you've been seeing things."

My blood went cold. "You talked to Sarah?"

"Of course. We're all so worried about you." Her hand reached out, fingers cold even through my sleeve. "Perhaps you should take some time off. Before something happens."

I pulled away and pushed through the door into the brutal cold.

Behind me, I heard her laugh.

The drive to Otter Creek took forty-five minutes. The landscape was flat and featureless, an endless expanse of white broken only by the occasional stunted tree. The sky pressed down like a lid. I kept checking my rearview mirror, but the road behind me was empty.

The fish camp appeared like a wound in the snow. Three shacks, their walls gray and skeletal, leaning into the wind. Thomas's truck was parked at an angle, driver's door still open. I killed my engine and stepped out into the screaming cold.

"Thomas?"

The wind swallowed my voice.

I approached the nearest shack, my hand on my service weapon. The door hung from one hinge, creaking with each gust. Inside, the floor was thick with drifted snow. An overturned chair. A rusted kerosene heater.

"Thomas!" I called again.

"Here."

I spun. He was standing behind me, maybe fifteen feet away. His face was haggard, eyes sunken and red-rimmed. He looked like he hadn't slept in days.

"Are you alright?"

He shook his head. "It's been following me for three days. Tall, thin, like a shadow standing up. I see it in my rearview mirror. At the edge of my property. Sometimes I hear it walking on my roof at night."

"Thomas, what's—"

"I need you to tell me the truth." His voice cracked. "Is this because of my daughter?"

Relief flooded through me, so intense I almost staggered. "Yes. Nika. You remember her."

His face went blank. "Who?"

"Nika. Your daughter. Eight years old. I found her four nights ago, saved her life—"

"I don't have a daughter." The words were flat, automatic. "I have a son. Tobias. He's six."

"No. No, you came to the station. You brought me fish. You said—"

"I've never been to the station." He took a step back. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Thomas, please." I pulled out my phone, scrolling through photos. I had to have something, some proof. But when I got to the night of the rescue, there was nothing. Just a gap in the timeline. Photos from 02:45, then nothing until 04:23.

"You called me," I said desperately. "Twenty minutes ago. You said you were being followed."

"I called you because it's getting worse." His voice dropped to a whisper. "The shadow. It's getting closer. Last night, it stood at my bedroom window. I could see its outline against the glass. And Benjamin..." He looked at me with naked terror. "It was wearing your coat."

The cold suddenly felt colder.

"What are you talking about?"

"Your SAR coat. I could see the patch. Your name. HARPER, B. But the letters were backwards." He was shaking now. "What did you do? What did you bring back with you?"

"I saved a little girl," I said, my voice low and steady. "Your daughter."

"I don't have a daughter!" The scream tore from him as he fumbled for his car door handle, his eyes wide with pure terror. "I've never had a daughter! Get away from me!"

He pushed my hand away. He got into the car and shut the door. The engine started. He drove off down the street. The taillights shrank in the dark and then were gone.

I took a step forward, a plea on my lips, but a hand fell on my shoulder, its grip firm and final. I turned.

Dale was standing there, smiling. That same warm, vacant smile I'd seen on my family. On Morrison. On everyone.

"Hey, Ben." His voice was too loud, too cheerful. "What are you doing all the way out here?"

"Dale?" My heart was hammering. "How did you—when did you—"

"I was checking the nets. Caught some nice char today." He gestured toward the third shack. "Want to see?"

His shadow was wrong.

The sun was low, casting long shadows across the snow. Mine stretched out beside me, a normal human silhouette. But Dale's was too tall, too thin, stretching back toward the shack in a shape that didn't match his body.

"Dale," I said slowly, "I think you should step back."

"Why?" That same bright smile. "I'm just here to help."

"You don't fish, Dale. You're a vegetarian. You've told me a thousand times."

The smile didn't falter. "Of course I fish. I've been fishing here for years."

"No," I said. "You haven't."

For a moment, nothing moved. The wind died. Even the creaking of the shack fell silent. Dale stood perfectly still, that smile frozen on his face like a photograph.

Then his head tilted. Slowly. Mechanically. The exact angle the Walker had used.

"You should go home, Benjamin," he said. The voice was still Dale's, but layered underneath was something else. Something that sounded like wind through empty buildings. "Your family misses you."

"That's not my family."

"Isn't it?" The head tilted further, past any natural range of motion. "Sarah's making dinner. The kids are doing homework. Everything is exactly as it should be. You're the one who's wrong. You're the one who doesn't fit."

Behind him, the shadow elongated. Stretched. The sunlight seemed to bend around it, creating a void in the shape of a person.

I reached for my service weapon, but my hand was shaking too badly to draw it.

"Dale, if you're still in there—"

"I'm fine," he said, his voice still bright. "Better than fine. I don't have that headache anymore. I don't have those nightmares. I'm not afraid." The smile widened. "You could be like this too, Benjamin. No more pain. No more fear. Just peace."

"That's not peace," I whispered. "That's nothing."

The thing wearing Dale's face took a step closer. In the direct sunlight, I could finally see what Thomas had seen. The skin wasn't quite right. Too smooth. Too uniform. Like someone had painted over a surface that was never meant to hold paint.

And underneath, where the shadow met the snow, there was no texture. No depth. Just a flat, absolute black.

I grabbed the flashlight from my belt and shone it directly at Dale's face.

For a fraction of a second, the light passed through him. I could see the shack behind, the gray wood visible through his chest like he was made of smoke.

Then he solidified again, but the smile was gone. His face had gone slack, features settling into something smooth and featureless. The mouth was too wide. The eyes were too far apart.

"You looked," it said in a voice that was no longer Dale's. "Rule Two. You're not supposed to look."

"It's two in the afternoon," I said, backing toward my truck. "The rules only apply after three AM."

The thing that wasn't Dale laughed. It was a sound like ice cracking on a frozen lake.

"The rules changed, Benjamin. When you took the debt, you changed them. Now we can come anytime. Anywhere. As long as the ledger needs balancing."

Behind it, more figures were emerging from the shacks. Tall, impossibly thin, their shapes cutting sharp silhouettes against the white expanse. But these weren't shadows. These were people. The man from the third shack. A woman in a parka. An elder with a walking stick.

All of them smiling with that same vacant expression.

All of them moving with that same fluid, unnatural grace.

"Dale," I tried one more time. "Dale, I know you're in there. You showed me the photo. You remember Nika. You remember the rules."

For just a moment, something flickered behind those too-wide eyes. A spasm of recognition. Fear.

"I looked," Dale whispered, his voice suddenly his own again. "Oh God, I looked right at it. It was wearing my mother's necklace. The one I buried her with. I saw it and I looked and now—"

His eyes snapped back to that placid blankness. The flicker was gone.

"Dale zones out sometimes," the thing said in that layered, wrong voice. "He'll be fine. He'll be better. He'll be balanced."

Dale turned away from me, his movements suddenly jerky and mechanical. He walked back toward the shacks with rigid, upright posture, not looking back.

I ran for my truck.

The Walkers didn't follow. They just stood there, a line of figures against the white, watching as I fumbled with my keys, as I gunned the engine, as I fishtailed away from the camp.

In my rearview mirror, I saw Dale get into his truck. He sat perfectly still, hands at ten and two, staring straight ahead.

Then he drove away in the opposite direction.

I made it back to town by 16:30. The sun was already setting, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple. I didn't go to the station. I went to the library instead.

Margaret was at the front desk, stamping books with metronomic precision. When she saw me, her face lit up with that same too-wide smile.

"Benjamin! How lovely to see you."

"I need to see the old SAR records again. From 1956."

"Of course, dear." She stood up with impossible fluidity. "Right this way."

She led me to the basement. The stairs creaked under our feet. The lights flickered.

"You know," she said conversationally, "I've been thinking about our last conversation. About Auntie."

"What about her?"

"You asked how old she was." Margaret stopped at the bottom of the stairs, turning to face me. In the dim light, I could see that her shadow was too long, stretching back up the stairs in a shape that didn't match her body. "That was very rude, Benjamin. You shouldn't ask elders their age."

"Margaret, when did you start working here?"

"Oh, I've been here for years."

"How many years?"

Her smile didn't waver. "Does it matter?"

I pushed past her into the archives. The boxes were where I'd left them four days ago, but when I opened them, the photos were different.

The group photo from 1956. The one with Auntie in the back row. She was gone. Just a gap where she should have been, the people on either side standing slightly too far apart.

The dedication ceremony from 1968. No Auntie.

The wartime civil defense meeting. No Auntie.

I went through every box, every file, every photograph. She'd been erased. Removed from the record like she'd never existed.

Except for one photo.

At the bottom of the last box, tucked into an unmarked envelope, was a single black and white photograph. It was old, the paper yellowed and brittle. The date on the back read February 3.

She looked exactly the same. Same gray hair. Same smile.

The caption on the back was in Russian, but someone had translated it in faded pencil: *The witch Akna receives her mark. May God have mercy on her soul.*

I heard footsteps on the stairs.

I shoved the photo in my pocket and turned. Margaret was standing in the doorway, backlit by the stairwell lights. Her silhouette was too tall, too thin.

"Find what you were looking for?" she asked.

I didn't answer. I pushed past her and ran up the stairs. Behind me, I heard her laugh, just like Akna.

"A few more shifts left, Benjamin," she called after me. "The ledger is almost balanced."

I burst out into the cold evening air and ran for my truck. The streets were empty. The windows of the houses glowed with warm light, families gathered for dinner, everything normal and perfect and wrong.

My radio crackled to life.

"Unit Seven, this is dispatch." Auntie's voice. Calm. Professional. "We have a welfare check at 342 Maple Street. Requesting your response."

342 Maple Street. My house.

"Negative," I said into the radio. "I'm off duty."

"Benjamin." Her voice dropped, becoming intimate. Threatening. "Your family is waiting for you. Sarah made pot roast. Your favorite. Don't you want to go home?"

I looked up at my rearview mirror.

She was sitting in my back seat.

Not a reflection. Not a shadow. Auntie herself, flesh and blood and impossibly there, her hands folded in her lap, that patient smile on her face.

"You can't run from this," she said softly. "The debt doesn't disappear just because you're afraid. It follows you. It waits. And when the ledger finally balances, you'll be grateful for the peace."

I threw open my door and fell out into the snow. When I looked back, the truck was empty.

But I could still hear her voice, carried on the wind.

"Few shifts left, Benjamin. Then you'll understand. Then you'll stop fighting. Then you'll be accounted[.](https://www.reddit.com/user/YourUsername/)"
