  I have been a lurker enough on this site to know its many eccentricities and strange tales already. I know people who live on the margins. It’s always sad to see one of them die alone where I work – it always is. This circumstance however becomes wholly more strange when their bodies are left unattended in a train station for entire days. It’s been two days now since I buried the man whom I knew as one of many hermits who cloister themselves in the barren county I work in away from civilisation. He was a collector of ferrous and tin recyclables and I had even shared a talk with him before. But even in consideration of the fact that this county is reserved primarily for mines and industrial activities hours away from the city, it’s still strange that nobody came to deal with his body two days after. By then, what remained was a grey bloat cracked with purple veins, smothered in the rotten-fruit cologne of what used to be that man.



  What I have said is most of what you need to know about the circumstances surrounding this man before his passing. They are bleak circumstances that give to his passing but explain neither the almost willful negligence attributed to it nor the clear lies that the police have given me about this case.



  The county I work in is certainly large, it is sparse and uninhabited frontier land that only has one active police department that is quite acquainted with the accident-prone mines and industrial plants that line the region. They are usually quite an honest and friendly folk that have no reason to give untruths surrounding a benign case such as this. They are usually not ones to say that they have immediately dispatched a squad of their own to investigate and handle a dead body when that body remains untouched a week after. It was disconcerting to say too little.



  Regardless, as many finer men than me have said – what is done is done. The body is buried and the video of its burial is sent to the police much to their oddly quiet acknowledgements. I guess why I am writing the post now is to reach out to people working in epidemiology or related fields to ask about any possible diseases my colleagues and I might have contracted with our handling of the body.



  Despite the descriptions given of our country given above, I must assure all readers here that we are educated men – geologists, engineers and trained equipment operators all – and have taken the proper precautions expected when handling the body. We have used the standard hazard suits and gas masks that workers on site use when dealing with poisonous gas or radioactive substances to protect ourselves, keeping the body inside two layers of plastic bags as waterproof carriers. He was buried far enough away from the train station at a lower elevation to prevent his remains from absorbing into the surrounding rainwater by accident. Lastly, the stains he left behind were wiped clean with paper towels and the type of cheap disinfectant you would find in supermarkets. I reiterate that what I type now, I type on board a train in a part of my country that receives poor reception from satellites and do not wish to find out what ingredients were used in that cleaner. In case it’s of any help, I will list the ingredients of the disinfectant in the comments.



  Having prefaced the above, I ask any professionals that may read this about a disease found in a dead body in dry climate in temperatures just below freezing (today four degrees celsius), left unburied for four days that may cause visual and auditory hallucinations in affected individuals – ones that are highly specific and material and that can even appear in the form of specific persons and items of recent memory. I am considering seeing a doctor for my conditions but do not want to have to in case this might simply be induced by tiredness or stress – to which I am no stranger to.



  We run a tight ship around these parts, being contracted by several high-profile state ventures to do what we do and take that in stride. When we were done burying the body, the shovels we used were taken back, cleaned and all accounted for in our mining site. It was hence very strange that I found one of those shovels back at the place where we had buried the body when I came the next day to offer incense to the dead man, though nothing else had changed. I dismissed this as a sign of my tiredness or a mistake in counting our equipment but I truly could not discount the next hallucinations I heard whilst waiting for my train.



  The train station was the last stop in the line that ran cross-country and was a subway station just a few ways underground. As the manager of the mining operation, I am quite often the last to leave for home and left to catch the last commercial train back to the nearest city where I live. Even so, I could’ve sworn I heard footsteps above me as I sat waiting for the train that comes every forty minutes in the region though they sounded bare of feet and strangely sandy. I am a perfectly rational man and know then that it only does good for both me and any other drunks that roam the wastes here not to meet. All they usually come to talk about is their grievances with the government, the opening of the country or money – I was drained enough from the day then and did not fancy talking about any of these things.



  The last of the things I noticed however was the one that prompted me to write this post. As I entered the train and it left soon after, its closed doors were met with a clear knocking from the outside that smarted me from my tiredness; the kind you might hear from someone knocking on one’s room door. The train was on the move then and sliding past my view out of the window was a deathly pale man about my height that wore on him a body covered in small and thin white hairs and nothing else – bald yet wrinkled. The only thing that had stopped me from completely losing myself in terror, looking at his blank-expressioned face, was the fact that he looked just like the homeless man whom I had buried the day before. That was enough to make the whole thing more surreal than anything else. I knew then that he had likely been a figment of my imagination and a sign that I should seek some kind of medical help.



  As I finish up this post, I remain unsure whether the nature of my condition is more medical or psychological. I certainly feel fine, aside from the beginnings of a minor cold that always persisted for me, but I know that serious conditions like this usually follow symptoms that appear innocently enough. I turn forty eight this year, engage in no vices of substance and have a history of high blood pressure in my family and nothing else. Any insight into my possible condition is appreciated, though I am well aware that I am half making this post just to get all of this off my chest. Regardless of how this pans out, I am visiting a temple today. I’m Buddhist but haven’t been very religious since I got this position; you just can’t be too safe with these things.



Edit: If possible, responses that come within the next day or two would be preferable. I would rather know if I’ve contracted anything that could possibly be contagious as I am taking my daughter out for dinner and live with my elderly mother. I should also state that English is not my first language which is why certain phrasing used might be clunky here. I assure you that I already struggle to speak informally with my colleagues and can only imagine how strange I sound right now.
