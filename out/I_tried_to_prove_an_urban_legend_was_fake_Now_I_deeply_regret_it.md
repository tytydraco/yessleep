Two weeks ago I was sitting at my PC doing my work, as soon as I finished everything I could calmly relax and sit in silence with a cup of coffee.

Wandering the internet I came across an announcement about __4 missing teenagers__ in the old town district.

I got interested and decided to check information about this place on maps and the city forum on Facebook and Twitter.

After a couple of hours and 5 drunk cups of coffee I didn't find much information, only the names of the missing children and the urban legend about the cursed Darrowood Estate.

**The legend sounded something like this: In 1975,millionaire Arthur Darrowood, known for his cruelty and greed, disappeared without a trace along with his wife and two children. He built his fortune on a network of huge animal slaughter farms for meat processing plants. His wealth and influence skyrocketed after some deal made at an old Indian market. The locals are sure that he brutally scammed the traders there, and in retaliation they cursed him and his entire family.**

But there were other, more creepy rumors. In whispers on forums, people wrote that the real reason for his wealth was not the deal. They said that Arthur Darrowood worshiped something ancient and dark in the basement of his estate. That he sacrificed not only animals from his slaughterhouses, but also something more, so that this "entity" would grant him power.

Since then, the estate has stood abandoned. And every few years it demands a new sacrifice, luring inside those overcome by curiosity. Those who disappear seem to be erased from the city's memory, and only the most meticulous, like me, can find mentions of them.

The residents are sure that the teenagers disappeared for the same reason as the Darrowood family.

The local police brush off these answers and say that these are just urban legends and that the owner of the estate simply left the country.

After digging around on the internet some more, I looked up lists of missing people in my state, county, city, and specifically in that area. All the disappearances occurred at 7-year intervals on the fourth Saturday of the month. How many people have actually disappeared there is unknown.

Since I had no work ahead of me and had three days off, I decided to go there and find out the secret of the disappearances in this district. It could help me with my work and for writing various articles for clients.

Besides, debunking such a strong and long-standing urban legend would be an achievement for me. I packed the necessary things into a backpack and went to the car. It wasn't a long drive for me. About 1.5 hours and knowing the routes that could shorten the path I would get there even faster.

Almost reaching my destination by cutting through my shortcut, the car stalled 2km from the estate and there wasn't much gas left so I left it in place and walked on along the old country road which was clearly part of the Darrowood Estate.

After 30 minutes I was there, I saw a huge, rotten, horrifying four-story building. In front of me stood a half-meter black metal fence, on the roof of the estate there were stone sculptures resembling gargoyles, on the walls of the building there were mysterious runes. This whole atmosphere brought ideas into my head. And these ideas were only about one thing - to get away from this place and forget that it even exists.

I was too scared but I decided to at least inspect the yard.

– **Not for nothing I came here, right? I asked myself.**

A sudden, deafening screech made me flinch. Goosebumps ran down my spine, and icy sweat broke out all over my body. My heart beat so loudly that I was afraid the echo would spread throughout the entire area.

– **Phew.. Just the gate creaking I muttered aloud**

I began to study the yard. After about forty minutes, when my nerves had calmed down a bit, I didn't find anything special - just a couple of empty beer bottles and a rusty shovel lying by the fence. Deciding that all the most interesting things were hidden inside, I headed towards the door of the house.

Step by step I approached along the old, creaky porch. Every sound under my feet echoed in the silence like a shot. And now I am in front of a massive, cracked door. My hand reached for the handle...

And at that moment I tripped.

Something hard and angular lay right under the floorboard, covered with fresh leaves and a layer of light dust. I moved away and brushing away the leaves and dirt with my hand...

I saw HER

A camera, an old 2015 model, an expensive model, somewhat similar to a Sony HDR-XR550E camera. It had a worn body. That didn't make me freeze. Its strap was tightly wrapped around a broken board, as if someone had broken free and it was torn out by force.

Taking a knife out of my backpack, I cut the strap and wiped the camera, turning it on I was surprised to see a little charge. Putting the camera in my backpack, I was about to go inside the house when I saw some stains on the door and on the floor.. No-it wasn't dirt

Rusty-brown with characteristically dull brown spots and imprints of hands..

My throat went dry. This was not just a lost camera. This was evidence.

In those same seconds, my heart began to beat so fast as if it was tearing out of my chest. The pain in my temples was unbearable. Yielding to animal instinct, I without thinking started to run back, I ran very fast so fast not noticing the roots and bumps under me which were just begging to tangle and leave me longer in this terrifying place. In less than a couple of minutes I was at the car.

My hands were shaking, on the 4th try I inserted the key into the car. Every little rustle of leaves and branches made me flinch. As soon as I opened the door, I tumbled into the cabin. The click of the door closing was now the sweetest sound to me. Only here, in relative safety, did I allow myself to catch my breath.

My heart was still beating wildly, ready to jump out. I looked at my pale, frightened face in the rearview mirror, then turned to the backpack on the passenger seat.

Inside lay it. The proof. That very piece of nightmare that I had brought out of the cursed place.

I started the car and hit the gas, without turning on the headlights, as if afraid to attract someone's attention. I was leaving there. But along with me rode that chilling horror, firmly frozen to my back. And a quiet, obsessive understanding that I had touched something that was better never to touch.

Already at home, having locked all the locks, I was able to exhale with relief. I felt relatively safe.

Catching my breath, gathering all my remaining strength into a fist, I decided to take the camera out of the backpack.When I took it out it was very cold. It felt like it came straight from the snowy Alps and not from a warm backpack.

I was dying to know what was on that camera. I connected it to the pc there was only one file. The filename is just a date.That same 4th Saturday of the month. Overcoming fear,with a trembling hand, barely collecting my thoughts and calming down, I made up my mind.

I opened it.

*[00:00:01]* Camera shaking in a small van.Filmed in first person. 4 teenagers are laughing and noisily discussing something. Those same 4 missing teenagers.

*[00:01:07]* They were driving down the same road as me,in the background you can hear voices and discussions of that same urban legend, a phrase is clearly audible:

· These legends are nonsense, I don't believe it, this building is just ordinary bums and drug addicts.

*[00:01:15]* The camera is shaking badly,heavy breathing is heard. The estate comes into the camera lens. Approximate conversation in the video

**Voice 1 - Are we really going in? maybe we shouldn't..?**
 
**Voice 2- Don't be afraid, Amanda, everything will be fine.**

**Voice 3- What exactly are you worried about? I'm telling you, there are only bums there.**

**Voice 4- We will all die there! a phrase came from the teenager's lips and then only his laughter and some conversations are heard.**

The video cut off abruptly.

*[00:02:30]* screams are clearly heard the camera is shaking a teenager descended from the 3rd floor to the 2nd dropping the camera it falls it looks at the ceiling of the 4th floor from which some burgundy liquid is dripping.Down after him runs another teenager screaming.

(Hearing these voices, screams and seeing the further picture, I almost vomited, I barely restrained myself from turning off the PC and hiding in a corner in fear.)

**Voice 3 - I WAS WRONG I WAS WRONG IT'S NOT BUMS RUN LUCA RUN The video cuts off.**

*[00:03:30]* Very heavy breathing near the camera.Darkness.Running and footsteps are very clearly heard, literally after a couple of minutes screams. Very strong desperate screams of pain. The camera swayed,crying could be heard. voice 4 whispers- I knew I shouldn't have come here I knew... if you find this video never come here. Most likely my friends are dead. I'm sitting in this nook in the basement.. I'll turn on night mode.

The video shows a huge damp old basement. All the walls are in the same runes as outside the building. In the middle is a strange pentagram. Around it are bones and sticky traces. Most likely from blood. Very heavy footsteps are heard towards the camera. The video turns off.

*[00:04:10]* The camera is lying on the porch right where I picked it up.Sounds of struggle, crying and screams are heard, a horrifying laugh as if the person or creature making it had its vocal cords torn out and it was screaming these rasps through pain.The camera turns and you can see a teenager clearly no longer alive being dragged deep into the building. The door slammed shut by itself with such force that it almost broke out from the other side.

At that point I thought that was it. Fear and adrenaline were overwhelming me. I wanted to take a knife and lock myself in a bunker so that I could see from all sides what was happening. But then the camera suddenly turned on,there was one last fragment.

*[00:07:45]* You can see something in a sloppy,dirty butcher's apron stained with fresh blood, takes the camera and for a couple of seconds just looks into the camera and laughs, no face is visible, no eyes or pupils either. The most terrifying thing I saw at that moment was not its nasty laugh. But what made me break into a hot sweat and gave me goosebumps from fear. On its head it had stretched the skin from each teenager's face. A kind of mask hiding its true face. Only a couple of barely audible phrases came from its mouth, it felt like its mouth was glued or sewn shut, in a very quiet hoarse voice it said

- *Don't come to my estate. You are next*

And a very strong loud laugh. He looked into the camera right in the center. As if he was looking right into my eyes with his darkness.The video cut off at that moment. Apparently he threw the camera on the porch as bait. This was clearly not a human.

Running his words through my head, I felt an icy cold in my stomach. As if someone had stuck a fork in me and twisted it. I was scared to death but the metallic taste and adrenaline made me delete all the files from the computer without thinking. I wasn't thinking about evidence or calling the police or anything else. At that moment I just wanted to get rid of it. I took the camera, went out into the backyard of my house, I stomped on the hard drive and the camera. Then I wrapped it all in a rag soaked in gasoline and went over it well with a hammer. I took a match, lit this bundle with the remains of the camera and poured gasoline until only the body remained.

I don't know what to do now. I destroyed everything, but I feel like it changed nothing. He said you are next. This means he knows not only about me. He knows about everyone who can read this and see.

I am writing here because I had to warn you. Because I could no longer keep it to myself. If you ever hear about the Darrowood Estate- run. If you feel curiosity pulling you there - turn around and leave. This is not a joke. It is not a legend.

He is real. And he is looking for new guests, he is waiting. Every 7 years. 4th Saturday of the month.

He was looking right at me through the camera. And I know he saw my face. I hear footsteps in my house every night. My apartment smells of copper and old meat. I can't sleep. I am writing this because I am tired of enduring. I can't do anything about it anymore.

Don't look for this place. Don't repeat my mistakes. He does not forgive. Never try to debunk urban legends if you value your life. If you want a quiet life,don't mess with this. Never. **I REPEAT NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AS I DID.**

I think I'm slowly going crazy.

P.S. If I stop responding to comments, you can be sure I have disappeared like all these people. It's all the work of **Arthur Darrowood**.
