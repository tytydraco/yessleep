Head hurts, been i think two and a half weeks since everyone disappeared, found this notebook, nothing inside besides some assholes poem and signature on the front page, tore it out and stomped it into the ground, felt kinda bad after, but i need this book, figured as the last man on earth i have some responsibility to make sure the apocalypse is acuractely recorded, incase aliens invade in a thousand years and wanna know how we fucked everything up

Day 19 (i think). Starting to get lonely, i wonder how long it takes for someone to lose their mind without any human contact, i think 17 days, i had fun at first, hit a home run at yankees stadium on only the fiftieth try, drove a camaro into the front window of the store of that shithead who banned me, and went and smashed my ex girlfriends windows with the bat i hit the home run with, but im starting to miss people, weird cause i dont really have any people to miss

Day 22. Starting to hallucinate, saw a person on top of a roof, looked like a sniper, im so sure i saw it but once i got there not a trace of anyone

Day 23. Found a teddy bear, hes all i have in this baren wasteland now, his names tim

Day 26. Holy shit, almost died today almost fucking died, NOTE TO SELF:DO NOT GO INTO THE WOODS AFTER DARK, i dont even know how to explain in writing what the fuck i just saw, and killed, it almost looked human but paper thin and ran around on all foors, and the fucking teeth, the damn thing bit my wrist and i had to bash in its skull with a rock, hindsight the thing was so decrepit that i probably could've caved its head in with just my thumb, its blood was greasy and black and smelled like sulfar

Day 28. got cornered by a pack of those weird dog things and would've gotten eaten but someone saved me, the sniper from the roof, she shot all four of them point blank in the chest and then lead me to this compound, they seem like military, kinda makes me feel less special knowing im not really the last man on earth, but i guess its good to know i wasnt actually hallucinating, unless im hallucinating right now

Day 29. They finally told me who the boss of this place is, "general miller", wont let me see him though, sniper chick is actually pretty cool but even she wont let me know her name, they all have name tags but they take them off when im around, they want me to earn their trust

Day 31. Im fucked, walked into a tent labeled meeting room and saw one of the soldiers talking to some guy about training, the guy said "im sorry but i cant join you i need to get out there and find my daughter", the soldier immediately grabbed a box cutter from the table and slit the guys throat, he noticed me and called for two other soldiers to drag me into a cell in an underground system they had constructed

Day 34. Dont know why they're keeping me here, clearly they want me alive for some reason because they keep giving me water, no food though

Day 36. Finally met general miller, and the base scientist, apparently when that thing bit me it gave me an infection that if spread will wipe out the little of whats left of the human race, general miller said "i should probly just shoot you in the face right now get it over with but I've got better plans for you boy" i responded "just kill me now fucker cause ill never join your cult" he just scoffed and walked away 

Day 46. I've never been more confused and pissed off in my life, instead of just putting me out of my misery these bastards plan on putting me in a pod and shipping me out to FUCKING MARS

Day 53. Well im in the pod, i tried to fight but the soldiers overpowered me, i did get to spit in general millers face though

Day 54. Its oddly peaceful out here, who knew the vacuum of space was so beautiful, calming even, they didnt send me with any food or water, just this book, and tim, i got a glimpse of sniper chicks nametag as i was ascending "lee" 

Day 55. Cant stop thinking about the poem i ripped out of this book when i first found it
"you think you're a castaway but maybe its you whose cast society away, and maybe rightfully so. Sighned, Everleigh" she tried to warn me
