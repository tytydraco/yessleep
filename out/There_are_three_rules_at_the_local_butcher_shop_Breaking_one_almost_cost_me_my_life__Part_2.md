That first day was one of the most awkward situations I’ve ever been in, with the next couple of days being much of the same. He didn’t explain much. He moved like a machine, every cut precise and calculated. I started with trimming the fat off rib-eye steaks, following his silent instruction as best I could. Once I had mastered steak trimming, he let me butcher my first full carcass… a large pig. It had already been gutted and was hanging from a hook at the back of cooler number one.

He had seven total walk-in coolers, each labeled with the type of meat they contained. Coolers one and two contained pork, while coolers three through five had beef. I didn’t know what the last two contained. They were tucked in the back of the building behind plastic strip curtains with no labels on them. I didn’t ask about them. I figured if he wanted me to know what was in there, he would tell me.

I hit the release button on the hoist, and the pig carcass came slamming down onto the meat cart. I wheeled the carcass into the cutting room, and George helped me raise it onto the table.

He handed me a boning knife, smiling wryly.

“Start at the hock and work your way up,” he said, staring at me. “Don’t hit the bone, it dulls the blade.”

He looked down at the carcass and pressed his finger into a visible groove in the skin, tracing an outline as if he were using his finger as a blade.

“Slide between the joints. The muscle will show you where to go.”

I didn’t want to screw it up, so I watched and copied. It took hours to break it down, wrap the cuts, and label them. Chops. Loin. Belly. Hams. The primal cuts. I eventually zoned out, falling into the steady flow of butchery. There was something meditative about the work. It was so repetitive, yet precise and clean in a twisted way.

Then came the second carcass. Bigger. Not a pig this time. I recognized it immediately. George rolled the meat cart into the cutting room with a large deer lying across it. He slid the carcass onto the floor, motioning for me to help him. I hurriedly grabbed the hind legs and lifted the animal onto the cutting table. In the back of my mind, I thought that this was what the last two coolers were for. Wild game meat. It was weird to see venison in a butcher shop, but not unheard of.

“Got a special request,” George said as he began sharpening his knife.

I didn’t ask questions. I just followed George’s lead, hesitantly at first, but eventually falling back into the groove I had found with the pig carcass. Cut. Wrap. Label. Stack.

We cut meat next to each other deep into the night, finally finishing the last cuts just after 2 am. I labeled the last couple of pieces and started washing everything down. George slid off his coat, hanging it on an old, rusted rack next to the entrance of the cutting room.

“Get the rest of the trays cleaned and spray the tables down.” He said, wiping his arms down with a rag. “After that, you can head on home.”

He paused for a moment before looking up at me.

“Ya did good today, kid.” He said, smiling slightly. “I gotta admit, I didn’t think you’d make it, but you have thoroughly impressed me.”

He tossed the rag into a dirty old trash bin next to the coat rack and pushed the plastic strip curtains aside, walking out of the cutting room and toward the front counter. I quickly turned my attention to the meat trays, trying to get them clean as fast as possible so I could head home for the night.

The last tray clattered as I shoved it into the drying rack. I grabbed the hose and sprayed down the cutting tables, blasting away the blood along with bits of fat and bone clinging to the metal. The red-tinged water swirled toward the rusted floor drain, slowly spiraling into a clumpy stream of detritus. Though there was none left, the smell of raw meat lingered in the air, thick and heavy. No matter how much soap and water I used, the smell remained.

Just as I was about to turn off the hose, I heard a dull thud echo from somewhere inside one of the walk-in coolers. It wasn’t loud, but it was enough to make me stop what I was doing. I paused, shutting off the water to listen closely. Silence flooded back into the room, with the only audible sound being the buzzing fluorescent lights above me.

My curiosity gripped me. I figured it was probably George stacking some boxes or checking stock, but something in the back of my mind was telling me to look.

“George?” I called out, wiping my hands on my apron.

There was no answer. I stepped into the hallway, the chill immediately biting at my damp skin. My eyes immediately drifted to the curtains that concealed coolers six and seven. I quickly, but carefully, made my way down the hall. Pushing through the curtain, I revealed the mythical metal doors of the last two coolers. They were thick, reinforced with something beyond normal insulation. I hadn’t really paid attention before, but now, as I stood in front of them, I could see deep scratches around the handle of cooler seven. They were faint... barely showing through the shining stainless steel, but they were there.

I reached out, half-ready to turn the handle, when a voice cut through the cold air behind me.

“Don’t go in there.”

I turned fast, nearly slipping on the wet floor. George stood on the other side of the curtain, holding it aside with one hand. His face was half-lit by the overhead bulb, cloaking his eyes in mystery.

His voice was calm, but something in the way he stood there made my hair stand on end. He waited rigidly under the dying orange light with his other hand behind his back as if he were hiding something.

“Sorry,” I stammered, stepping back. “I thought I heard something.”

He stared at me for an uncomfortable amount of time, then nodded. “Sometimes the coolers creak. Pipes knock. This place is old; you’ll get used to it.”

He gestured toward the front of the shop.

“Go home. Get some rest. We’ve got a lot of orders tomorrow.”

Stunned by the interaction, I didn’t move right away, and neither did he. An uncomfortable silence once again filled the space between us. After what felt like an eternity, he spoke, cutting the tension.

“Ya did good today,” he repeated. “But don’t let your curiosity cost you.”

He smiled, relaxing his rigid stance a bit. I nodded slowly and turned to head in his direction. His body took up the entire hallway... I would have to pass him to leave the shop. As I tried to duck through the curtain around him, he grabbed my arm, startling me.

“Wh… What’s wrong?” I asked, tripping over my words.

He stared into my eyes as if he were searching for something before quickly lifting a smile onto his face.

“Nothing… nothing’s wrong, son.” He said, still firmly holding my arm in his grasp. “I just don’t want to lose a good employee.”

His cold gaze pierced into my soul, delivering an unspoken warning of defying his judgment. He released my arm and stepped aside, allowing me to slide around him and out toward the front door. As I pushed the door open, I could feel his gaze burning a hole into the back of my head. I didn’t look back; the situation had already gotten uncomfortable enough. I had just stepped one foot out of the door when I heard his voice rise from behind me.

“Hey, kid, wait a second.”

Half of my brain was telling me to leave and not look back, yet the other half was telling me not to move. My fight or flight instinct was in deadlock. I slowly turned, expecting yet another death stare. George was walking toward me, looking down at something in his hands. He fumbled with it as he continually closed the gap between us. He stopped and pushed his hand out toward me.

“Here ya go.” He said in an upbeat tone, “Figured I’d give you your first week’s pay a little early.”

This was the complete opposite of what my mind had prepared me for. I looked down at his hand, which was full of crumpled-up bills. I paused for a moment, seemingly forgetting that this was my job now.

“Oh… thanks.” I stuttered as I reached out and grabbed the wad of bills from the man’s rough, calloused hand.

He smiled as he turned and walked back behind the counter, disappearing through the plastic strip curtains.

My mind raced as I walked out of the shop and towards my car. I sat down in the driver’s seat, replaying the interaction in my head. It was so strange… so tense. I tried to push it to the back of my mind as I looked down at my hand, which was still clutching the money he had given me. I unfurled my fist and dumped the cash out into my passenger seat. With the aid of my cabin light, I counted out three hundred and fifty dollars.

“What the fuck?” I said aloud, reeling from the amount. “This must be a mistake. There is no way he meant to pay me this much.”

I started to get out of the car and go back inside the shop, but my body wouldn’t let me. I had been overworked and underpaid for so long that this somehow felt… good. I had actually made some pretty good money for doing something that I thought, at this point, was fairly routine. I crumpled the bills back up and slid them into my pocket. I turned the key in the ignition and headed back to my cousin’s place to get some much-needed rest.

The next few shifts came and left, a lot faster than I had expected. By the time I clocked in each night, the place felt oddly familiar. It was as if nothing had changed. That I had always been here. George didn’t act any different… still cold and distant like normal, but as time passed, I started to get the sense that he had a side to him I hadn’t seen yet. I started to feel more uncomfortable with each passing day. It wasn’t the work that unsettled me; it was the silence. The way he moved. The way the place felt. The way I got paid. It all felt so… strange. It was just now dawning on me how weird this all was. I had been blinded by greed, allowing money to stifle my concerns.

My third week at the shop is when things took a turn. George had acted a little strange at the start of that Wednesday night, but I had just chalked it up to the work week taking its toll. It was just after 1 am when he handed me the usual pile of orders to prep for the next day. Beef. Pork. Venison. Just like always. I finished the cuts I had left on my table and began my nightly clean-up routine before moving to the next task. George hung up his coat and headed toward the coolers. I grabbed the last of the trash bags filled with used gloves and bloody rags and started tossing them into the industrial trash bin out back. It was deathly quiet out there. Not even the crickets dared disturb the silence.

I carried the last bag out into the alley and was about to tie it up when I heard footsteps approach from behind me. I stood up quickly, swirling around on my feet. George was standing at the back door, holding a cigarette, the warm glow of it illuminating his face as he took a drag.

“Got a minute?” he asked, his voice raspy, like it had been a long time since he’d spoken at all.

I nodded, unsure where this was going.

“Sure.”

He took a long, slow drag and tossed the cigarette on the ground, grinding it under his boot heel. The alley was dim, but I could make out his silhouette within the faint light of the doorway.

“You tired?” He asked, taking a step closer.

“Y… Yeah.” I answered, “I’m pretty beat.”

George smiled and looked up at the sky as if letting his mind wander.

“That’s good,” He responded, “it means you worked hard. Means you care.”

He looked back down at the ground, kicking at the gravel for a few seconds before speaking again.

“I don’t get a lot of people stopping by here anymore,” he started, voice low. “The shop’s been here a long time. Longer than most folks remember.”

He paused, staring blankly at the ground for a moment.

“You know, this place has a long and rich history. People used to drive a hundred miles to get meat from here. Used to have a line out the door.”

I didn’t say anything. What could I say? He seemed to be talking out loud to himself, and I wasn’t going to interrupt that.

George wiped his hands on his apron, then rubbed his neck like he was trying to stretch out tension.

“Times change,” he continued, his tone slipping into something more reflective.

“People want their meat from the grocery store now. They want convenience. No one comes to the butcher anymore.”

He turned his eyes toward me. I could barely make out his face in the dim light. He was studying me as if I were a part of a puzzle he was slowly solving.

“It’s hard to find good help nowadays.”

I nodded, unsure of how to respond. I didn’t know if he was trying to get me to feel sorry for him or just felt nostalgic for some reason.

“You remind me of someone,” George said abruptly. “Someone I used to know way back.”

That caught me off guard. He didn’t look old enough to have seen a lot of history, but he spoke like he had lived a hundred lifetimes.

“Who?” I asked before I could stop myself.

He smiled, but not in a warm way. It was the kind of smile you see in old photos of people who have seen too much.

“Ah, someone who understood this work. Not afraid of the mess or what it means to get dirty.”

His eyes narrowed, like he was waiting for my reaction.

“Most people don’t understand, you know? But you. You’re different.”

His voice dropped, and the weight of his words settled over me, snaking across my shoulders. I wanted to laugh it off, but something in his stare made it impossible to dismiss.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

For a moment, there was a strange tension between us. It wasn’t the summer heat, and it wasn’t the late hour. It was the look in his eyes. The kind you get from someone who knows something you don’t.

George stepped closer, his boots scraping against the gravel.

“Some jobs come with a price, kid. Some things you can’t unsee.” He chuckled, but it didn’t sound like he was joking. “The world doesn’t care about the blood spilled, as long as the cuts are right.”

I couldn’t speak. I felt like I had wandered into a conversation that I wasn’t supposed to hear. Everything inside of me was panicking, thinking that he might be having a strange flashback or something.

Suddenly, his voice shot through the dark, breaking me free from my spiral of worry.

“Now, get inside. We’ve still got work to do,” he said, his voice snapping back to business. “It’s late, and we can’t leave this mess behind.”

I stood there for a moment as he turned and headed back into the shop. My mind was buzzing with everything he had just said. I shook my head, forcing myself back into work mode, and shoved the last bag into the dumpster before quickly heading inside. For the rest of my shift, I tried to shake off the feeling that I had been handed a warning I wasn’t fully prepared to hear.

The next few days were more of the same. I had started to get used to the rhythm of the work, though it was still hard to ignore the deepening sense of something wrong in the air. The man didn’t speak much, but he didn’t need to. He was always watching, remaining sharp and vigilant. His movement never faltered, lending credence to his machine-like pattern. It was mechanical, like he had done this all his life and had no interest in anything else.

Now and then, I’d see or hear something that didn’t quite make sense. The marks on the metal doors of the coolers always loomed in the back of my mind, and yet, I always managed to push them away. The way George would become so still and so quiet if I ever mentioned the coolers was what stuck out to me the most. I couldn’t just push that away.

I started getting paranoid, wondering if I was just imagining things. I thought that maybe I was still getting used to the place. It wasn’t until I started to find strange things hidden throughout the shop that I couldn’t bury my concern anymore. I found an old butcher’s knife behind the counter that wasn’t like the others. This one had a strange patina, almost like rust, but darker. The edge was smooth but uneven, like it had been sharpened countless times. It had ornate designs that covered the crimson-red handle, like they had been carved by hand.

Strange words were etched into the butt of the handle. I couldn’t recognize them, but it seemed to be in Latin. The inscription read: “Memento Mori”. I had no idea why, but every time I looked at it, a chill ran through me. I told myself I was just overthinking. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn’t right with it. I slid it back into its drawer and left it alone, trying to forget I had ever seen it.

One night, just after we finished with another deer carcass, George handed me the usual wad of bills, this time, without even saying a word. It was another huge payout, but there was something about the way he handed it to me that unsettled me. He wouldn’t even look me in the eye. His gaze was fixed on the floor as if he were somewhere else entirely.

I slipped the money into my pocket, as always, and began sweeping the customer area. George was behind the counter, his back facing me. The overhead lights flickered, casting strange shadows across the room, stretching them across the white tiles. Something strange hung in the air, but I couldn’t figure out what it was.

Suddenly, I heard the faintest thud come from behind the coolers. My heart skipped a beat. I knew it wasn’t just the old building settling, not this time. I grabbed a rag and wiped my hands, trying to play it cool as if I had not heard anything. I wasn’t a seasoned vet, but I knew enough about this place to realize that something was off here. My mind raced, creating all manner of things that could’ve made the mysterious sound. Animals. Creatures. Anything and everything you can think of. Though my mind dared me to, I didn’t want to confront it yet.

I glanced at George. His back was still turned, but I could see his posture had changed. He was tense, like he was waiting for something to happen. I took the opportunity to speak up.

“George?” I called out, my voice wavering a bit.

He turned slowly, his gaze meeting mine. His eyes were empty. There was no warmth, no kindness, just cold calculation.

“I heard something,” I said, clearing my throat. “From behind the coolers.”

He was silent for a moment as if contemplating the right thing to say. He gave me a tight smile followed by a slight chuckle.

“You’re hearing things, kid. This place is old. It makes noise.” He said, pointing to the ceiling. “There are old pipes and vents everywhere. Don’t overthink it.”

His tone was firm, but there was something in his words that didn’t sit right with me.

I nodded but wasn’t convinced. As I moved toward the coolers to finish up and clock out for the night, I couldn’t help but glance at the back of the shop. The shadows gathered like they were hiding something, concealing secrets that weren’t meant to be found. Those thuds weren’t in my imagination. They were real. Little did I know I was getting closer to something I wasn’t ready to face.
