I never believed in fairy tales. Growing up, I thought they were just old stories, told to scare kids into behaving. But some stories aren’t made up. Some things are real, and I learned that the hard way.

Last winter, I went to visit a friend who lives deep in the German countryside. She’d just bought an old farmhouse surrounded by miles of forest, and she insisted I come for the weekend. I thought it’d be fun: cozy nights by the fire, a break from the city, and maybe a chance to clear my head.

The first night was fine. Quiet, peaceful. The second night, though... that’s when it started.

It was late, and a thick fog had rolled in, turning the world outside the windows into a swirling gray void. We were sitting in the living room, drinking wine and catching up, when I thought I heard something outside.

A voice.

It was faint, almost drowned out by the wind, but it was there, soft, lilting, like someone singing just out of earshot.

“Did you hear that?” I asked, setting my glass down.

My friend looked up, her face suddenly serious. “Hear what?”

“Someone’s... singing? Outside?”

She shook her head quickly, almost too quickly. “No, you’re imagining things. It’s just the wind.”

But I wasn’t imagining it. The voice grew louder, more distinct. It wasn’t a song exactly, more like a melody, wordless but somehow... inviting. Against my better judgment, I got up and went to the window.

I couldn’t see much through the fog, but as I pressed my face to the glass, a figure began to take shape.

It was tall and slender, draped in what looked like a long coat or robe that billowed in the wind. Its face was pale, almost luminous, with sharp features and eyes that seemed to glow faintly in the dark. It stood just at the edge of the yard, motionless, staring up at the house.

And then it smiled.

The voice in the wind grew clearer, and I swear it was speaking to me, though I couldn’t understand the words. It sounded like an old, forgotten language, beautiful but somehow wrong.

I stumbled back from the window, my heart racing. “There’s someone out there,” I whispered.

My friend froze. “Don’t look,” she said, her voice trembling.

“What? Why?”

“Just... don’t. If you see him, he’ll know you can hear him. And if he knows you can hear him...”

She trailed off, her face pale.

I didn’t know what she meant, but I didn’t get the chance to ask. The front door rattled, the handle twisting as if someone was trying to open it.

“Lock it,” my friend hissed. “Now!”

I rushed to the door and turned the deadbolt, my hands shaking. The rattling stopped, but the voice in the wind grew louder, and I realized it was calling my name.

“Who is that?” I demanded, backing away.

My friend grabbed my arm, her nails digging into my skin. “It’s him,” she whispered. “The Erlkönig. The King of the Elves. He lures people into the forest, and they’re never seen again.”

“That’s ridiculous,” I said, but my voice wavered.

She shook her head. “You don’t have to believe me. Just don’t answer him.”

The rest of the night was a blur of fear. The voice called out again and again, and each time, it felt closer, more insistent. At one point, I thought I heard footsteps on the porch, but I didn’t dare check.

When the sun finally rose, the fog lifted, and the voice disappeared.

We didn’t talk about it after that. I left that morning, cutting the weekend short, but I haven’t been able to shake the memory.

Sometimes, when I’m alone at night, I think I hear it again, a faint melody carried on the wind, calling my name.

And I’m terrified that, one day, I might answer.
