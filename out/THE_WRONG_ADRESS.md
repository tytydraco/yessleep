I work as a delivery driver in a small town where everyone knows each other. Nothing exciting ever happens here—at least, that’s what I thought before last night.

It was around 9:30 PM, my last stop of the night. The order was for a house on Willow Lane. I knew the street, but not the house number. When I punched it into my GPS, it led me somewhere I didn’t expect—a house I’d never noticed before. It was set back from the road, barely visible behind overgrown trees and tall, unkempt grass.

I almost thought I was in the wrong place. The house looked abandoned. The paint was peeling, the windows were boarded up, and the front steps were cracked, like no one had stepped on them in years. There were no porch lights, no sign of life. It didn’t make sense—why would someone order food here?

I double-checked the address. It was right there on my screen. I even checked the receipt. Same address. Same order. I hesitated, gripping the bag in my hands. Normally, I’d just leave the food at the door, snap a picture, and go. But something about this house made my stomach twist.

I knocked. No answer. I tried again. Still nothing. I was about to leave when my phone buzzed. A text from the number that placed the order.

“Door’s open. Come in.”

I stared at the message, my pulse quickening. No way. That wasn’t normal. Customers rarely asked me to come inside, and even if they did, I never did it. Company policy. And common sense.

I should have left right then and there. But I didn’t. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe I just wanted the tip. Either way, I reached out and tested the doorknob. It turned easily, and the door creaked open.

Inside, the air was stale, thick with dust and something else—something metallic. The kind of smell you just know isn’t right. The room was almost completely empty except for a single wooden chair sitting in the center of the floor. It was positioned so that it faced the door, as if someone had been sitting there, waiting.

The silence pressed in on me. I took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to leave. That’s when I noticed something on the floor near the chair. A dark stain, barely visible in the dim light. My throat tightened. It was blood.

I turned to leave, my heart hammering in my chest. But before I could even take a step, my phone buzzed again.

“Wrong house.”

I ran. I didn’t even think—I just bolted out the door and back to my car. My hands were shaking as I threw the food onto the passenger seat and started the engine. I didn’t stop until I was halfway across town.

When I finally calmed down enough to check my phone again, the messages were gone. No record of them. No order confirmation. Nothing. Like it had never happened.

The next morning, I drove by out of sheer paranoia. But the house? It wasn’t there. Just an empty lot, overgrown with weeds.

I don’t know where I went that night. I don’t know who—or what—texted me. But I do know one thing: I’m never taking another order on Willow Lane again.
