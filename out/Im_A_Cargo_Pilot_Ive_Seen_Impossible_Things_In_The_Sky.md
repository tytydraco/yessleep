I thought this belonged here.

I fly freight for a reputable company. I can’t tell you which one, but I can tell you that there's some weird shit happening above the clouds. 

This happened last night. 

My co-pilot, Waterson and I were scheduled to depart from Portland, Maine at 10:31 PM. The sky was clear and the air was cool.  Ahead of us was a five half hour flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It would be our final shipment of the night.

Things were normal for the first two hours. 

We cruised at our assigned altitude, the stars shining brightly above us. The radio chatter was quiet, and the hum of the engines provided a comforting rhythm. But then, as we flew over the Atlantic Ocean, things took a strange turn.

Waterson spotted it first. "What's that?" he asked, pointing at a strange light in the distance. It was unlike any aircraft light we had ever seen. It was pulsing, changing colors from red to green to blue in a mesmerizing pattern.

We radioed the air traffic control, asking if there were any other aircraft in the vicinity. But they reported no other flights in our area. The mysterious light seemed to be moving, slowly at first, but then it accelerated, darting across the sky with impossible speed.

As we watched in awe, more lights appeared, forming a formation that seemed to defy the laws of physics. They danced and weaved, leaving streaks of light behind them, creating a mesmerizing display against the night sky.

We tried to capture the phenomenon on our cameras, but every time we pointed our lenses at it, the lights would disappear, only to reappear in a different part of the sky. It was as if they were playing a game of cat and mouse with us.

The radio crackled to life with static, and we heard strange, garbled voices coming through. It sounded like a language we couldn't understand, almost otherworldly. It sent chills down our spines, and we couldn't shake off the feeling that we were being watched.

As the lights continued their aerial acrobatics, we decided to deviate from our flight path to get a closer look. We descended to a lower altitude, and the lights seemed to react to our presence. They circled around our aircraft, getting closer and closer.

Suddenly, our instruments went haywire. The compass spun wildly, and the navigation system malfunctioned. We were disoriented, and our communications with air traffic control were lost. We were alone, at the mercy of these mysterious lights.

The lights closed in on us, surrounding our aircraft from all sides. They illuminated our cockpit with an otherworldly glow. We could see their intricate details now, and they were unlike any aircraft we had ever seen. They were sleek, with smooth, metallic surfaces that seemed to reflect the starlight.

We were overcome with a sense of awe and terror at the same time. We couldn't explain what we were witnessing. These were not of this world. The lights moved with such precision and intelligence that it was clear they were not mere natural phenomena or man-made aircraft.

Just when we thought things couldn't get stranger, the lights suddenly vanished, leaving us in complete darkness. Our instruments came back online, and we were able to establish contact with air traffic control again. But our minds were reeling from what we had just witnessed.

We completed our flight to Fort Lauderdale in silence, both deep in thought. We landed safely, but we were left with more questions than answers. What had we seen? Who or what was behind those lights? And why did they choose to reveal themselves to us?

So far, we've kept our experience to ourselves, knowing that no one would believe us. But still, I can't help but look up, wondering if we'll ever encounter those impossible lights again, and what secrets they hold within them.
