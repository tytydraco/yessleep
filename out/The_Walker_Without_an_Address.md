Honestly, I'm not sure what to make of this story, but I'm still going to tell you.

A friend of mine – well, he’s more of a colleague, I’ve never really met him face-to-face, but I trust him – told me something strange that happened to him on his way home from work. He’s a pretty pragmatic guy, doesn’t really believe in ghosts or mystical stuff in general. He’s more down-to-earth.

Anyway, he was driving on a country road, not far from Limoges, one evening as the day was ending. The weather was a little gray, just an ordinary day, nothing out of the ordinary. But around a bend, he spotted a guy standing at the side of the road. So far, nothing too strange, there are always people walking along these little roads. But he told me that this guy had a really weird look about him.

He wasn’t a homeless person or someone who looked lost. No, this guy had an appearance that made him genuinely creepy. A coat that was too long, dark clothes, and an odd attitude. What disturbed him was that this guy seemed to... float. Or at least, that’s how it felt to him. As if his feet weren’t really touching the ground. He was walking, but it seemed like he was gliding above the road, like some kind of floating.

The creepiest part was when he tried to pull out his phone to film the scene, his phone completely failed. He said the screen went black instantly, like the battery had died, but he was sure it was fully charged. Plus, the car radio started crackling before cutting off completely, for no apparent reason. That’s when he started thinking that something wasn’t right.

Then, the really bizarre thing happened: a thick fog started forming, like magic. In just a few seconds, it was a real pea soup. He couldn’t see more than three meters in front of him. He sped up a bit, but when he passed the guy, he took one last glance in his rearview mirror.

What he saw froze him. The guy’s eyes were... empty. Not empty in the sense that he was tired or distracted. No, his eyes were like abysses, as if there was nothing inside them. No pupils, no irises, just total emptiness. A void. What’s even stranger is that afterward, he came across several online forums where people were talking about something they called “The Walker Without an Address.” Apparently, several people had seen this guy in different regions of France, around the same time. Always with that strange floating walk and those empty eyes.

I don’t know if this is an urban legend spreading or if it’s a real bizarre story, but honestly, it really disturbed me. Ever since he told me this, I’ve been careful not to take isolated roads at night. It makes me uncomfortable, and I can’t stop thinking about that guy. If anyone else has heard of this kind of phenomenon, I’d really like to know more.
