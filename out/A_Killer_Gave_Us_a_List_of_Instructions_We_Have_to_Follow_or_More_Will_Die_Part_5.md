To make contact with the Sinaloa Cartel in San Diego, you don’t just show up at a dingy bar or some dark alley like in the movies. No, the people running the largest and most powerful cells operate in plain sight. You find them behind businesses that look squeaky clean—legit operations like high-end car dealerships, trucking companies, even private security firms. They own parts of the city, and the trick is knowing where to knock.

La Colmena is nestled in the heart of the Port of San Diego, a sprawling, industrial maze of shipping containers, cranes, and warehouses. To the untrained eye, it looks like any other bustling freight company, with semi-trucks pulling in and out, workers in high-visibility vests crisscrossing the yard, and the hum of forklifts echoing across the asphalt. But under the surface, the Hive is a well-oiled machine—the nerve center of Sinaloa operations in Southern California, running everything from drug distribution to human trafficking out of one unassuming facility.

As we approach the entrance, the facade doesn’t fool me. I’ve been here before. This place is built like a fortress—armed guards at the gate, high-tech security cameras on every corner, and trucks loaded with product that are always on the move, even in the dead of night.

We approach the security checkpoint. The guards here aren’t your average rent-a-cops—they're cartel soldiers, heavily armed, their eyes sharp. They don’t smile, don’t joke around. You either have business, or you don’t belong.

A guard steps up to the driver’s side, his bulk filling the window as he leans in. His hand rests on the butt of his pistol, just in case.

"ID, please," he says, his voice polite but clipped, like he’s going through the motions.

I reach into my jacket and pull out my wallet, sliding my license into his waiting hand. His eyes flick down briefly to the ID, then back up to me. He doesn’t hand it back, though. Not yet.

"What's your business here?" The question is simple, but the edge in his voice isn’t. He knows no one just strolls into La Colmena without a damn good reason.

"We’re here to see Don Manuel," I say, keeping my tone even. There's no point in playing games with this guy. He’s not the decision-maker, just the gatekeeper. 

The guard raises an eyebrow. "Do you have an appointment with the CEO?" His words are loaded, almost daring me to answer wrong.

I lean in slightly, meeting his gaze head-on. "No appointment. But tell Águila that Detective Castillo has a message for him." I keep my voice low. The name should do the trick. Águila is one of Don Manuel’s trusted lieutenants. A man with enough pull to either get us inside or have us disappeared, depending on his mood.

The guard doesn’t flinch. He gives me a cold, assessing look. After a tense moment, he speaks again, his voice flat.

“What’s the message?”

I don’t blink. This is the part where every word counts. "Tell him the crows are gathering again. He’ll know what it means."

He studies me for a moment longer, then nods curtly. “Wait here.”

He walks off toward the small office near the entrance, leaving us standing in front of the gate. I glance at Audrey, who’s sitting next to me, her eyes scanning the yard ahead like she’s already counting exits and potential threats.

"Think he’ll bite?" she asks quietly.

"He’ll bite," I reply, though part of me wonders if we’re biting off more than we can chew.

The guard returns after what feels like an eternity. He taps the side of his earpiece, listening to a garbled voice on the other end. Finally, he jerks his head toward the gate.

“You’re in. Follow the main road straight to the loading docks,” he says flatly, handing my ID back. “Don’t make any stops, and don’t stray off the path. Águila will meet you there.”

No need to tell me twice.

As soon as we reach the loading docks, a group of vehicles appears from the far side, cutting across the yard. SUVs and pick-up trucks, blacked-out windows, and engines rumbling with quiet menace. They fan out, surrounding us in a tight semicircle, boxing us in.

Audrey’s hand twitches toward her gun, but I shoot her a quick glance. “Easy,” I murmur under my breath.

Doors swing open almost simultaneously, and a group of armed men step out. They fan out, forming a loose circle around us. They're all business, dressed in tactical gear, faces impassive. 

They don’t raise their weapons, not yet, but the message is clear: one wrong move, and we’re not leaving this place breathing.

At the center of the group, stepping out of the lead SUV, is Bruno "Águila" Pagán. Even in the fading light, he’s unmistakable—a stocky, broad-shouldered man with a cold, calculating gaze that could freeze you in your tracks. His dark hair is slicked back, and his face is a map of scars, each one telling a story of violence.

He doesn’t need to bark orders—the men around him know exactly what to do just by the way he moves. Águila earned his reputation as one of Vazquez’s most trusted and ruthless sicarios, a cartel hitman who doesn’t just kill—he makes examples of people. 
As we step out of the vehicle, I can feel the weight of every eye on us.

Águila leans against his SUV, arms crossed over his broad chest. His eyes, cold and unreadable, flick between the two of us, sizing us up.

“You’ve got some cajones showing up here, Castillo,” he says, his voice a low growl. “After the mess you left in Chula Vista.”

I force a tight smile, trying to keep the tension in my shoulders from showing. “Well, I figured I owe you that much, Bruno,” I say, keeping my tone level. “After all, I’m the reason Vásquez walked free that night.”

He’s still pissed about the ambush. That whole operation had been a disaster, and he wanted someone to take the blame. But I’m not about to let him pin it all on me. 

Águila steps forward, his bulk casting a long shadow in the fading light. "Last I checked, it was your so-called 'undercover operation' that brought a battalion of feds down on our heads. You screwed us, Castillo, and now you’re here, thinking you can waltz back in like nothing happened?”

I don’t bite back immediately, but I don’t let him off the hook either. “I didn’t screw anyone,” I say. “If I hadn’t done what I did, Vásquez would be sitting in a federal lockup right now. You know it. I know it.”

Águila's scarred face twisted into a sneer. "Loyalty is a funny thing, Castillo. You’re right—Vásquez isn’t rotting in a cell. But I still don’t trust you. The streets talk. They say you’ve been playing both sides. They say you're nothing but a pinche soplón (fucking snitch).”


He’s baiting me, trying to get under my skin.
 
“Look, Bruno,” I say, taking a deliberate step closer, “you can believe whatever bullshit the streets are saying, but I know the truth about what really went down.”

“So, what do you want, Ramon? You didn’t come all the way down here just to reminisce,” Águila asks in a voice low. “Spit it out.”

“I need to speak to Don Manuel,” I say flatly.

Águila lets out a low chuckle, shaking his head. “Whatever you need to say, you can tell me, cabrón. Anything for the Don goes through me now.”

“I’m not here to deal with the middleman, ese,” I say, keeping my voice steady but cold. “This is above your pay grade.”

“You must have a death wish, Castillo,” Águila spits, stepping even closer, his breath hot on my face. “You don’t get to come in here and act like you’re still one of us. You’re done, cabrón. The only reason you’re still breathing is because I haven’t decided how much fun I want to have before I end you.”

“You could try,” I reply. “But we both know Don Manuel would have your head if you did. You really want to risk that? Over some bruised ego?”

“You really think death is the worst thing that can happen to you?" he says, his voice dripping with menace. "There are things out there that'll make you beg for death.”

Before I can respond, Audrey steps forward. “Yeah, we know, pendejo,” she says, her eyes locked on Águila. “We’ve seen them.”

Águila's eyes flick toward her, and his sneer widens. "What’s this, Ramon? You bring your little puta (whore) along for protection? Thought you were a man who could handle his own problems."

"Leave her out of this," I say firmly, stepping between Audrey and him.

"You always had a soft spot for las pelirrojas (redheads)," he scoffs. "Your wife not putting out? Or is this one just a little more… eager?"

My jaw clenches, but I keep my voice level. "Watch your fucking mouth."

Águila raises his hand, motioning to his men. "Check her for a wire," he orders. "Let’s see if she's got anything hiding under that pretty little outfit."

Before I can react, one of his guys steps toward Audrey, his hand outstretched like he’s going to pat her down. My heart pounds in my chest, but I keep my movements calm, measured.

"Don’t lay a finger on her," I warn, my voice low, barely more than a whisper. But there's steel in my tone, and Águila's guy hesitates, looking back at his boss for guidance.

Águila chuckles darkly, waving his hand again, giving the go-ahead. The guy steps forward, reaching for Audrey’s shoulder.

As the thug reaches out to pat Audrey down, she moves with lightning speed. Her hand snaps up, grabbing his wrist before he can touch her. There's a flicker of surprise in his eyes as she twists his arm, forcing him to his knees. The other cartel members tense up, hands drifting toward their weapons.

I don't hesitate. In one swift motion, I draw my pistol and level it directly at Águila's forehead.

"Tell your men to back off," I bark, while a half-dozen barrels are trained back on us. Red laser sights dance across our chests.

Águila looks down the barrel of my gun, but instead of fear, a sly smile spreads across his face. He almost seems entertained. "You sure you want to do this, Ramón?" he asks casually, like we're discussing the weather. "You draw a gun on me, in my own house? That's a bold move."

“You have no idea how far I’m willing to go,” I reply coldly.

Aguila chuckles, shaking his head slowly. He raises a hand, signaling his men to back off. "Stand down," he orders. "Este tipo is right. You don't lay hands on another man's woman. We have standards."

His men hesitate for a moment before stepping back, the tension easing just a notch. Águila smirks slightly, as if amused by the whole situation. "So, what's it going to be, ese?

I don’t reply, keeping my aim locked on his.

I keep my gaze locked on Águila for a beat longer before I slowly lower my gun. Audrey releases her grip on the thug's twisted arm, giving him a little shove that sends him stumbling back toward his comrades. He glares at her but thinks better of making another move.

Águila adjusts his jacket, brushing off an invisible speck of dust, his eyes never leaving mine. "Smart choice," he says with a thin smile. "Follow me. Don Manuel is expecting us."

He turns on his heel and strides back to his SUV. His men disperse, some climbing back into their vehicles, others staying behind to keep an eye on us. Audrey and I exchange a quick glance. We both know we're stepping deeper into the lion's den.

We make our way back to our car, falling in line behind Águila's convoy as it snakes its way through the labyrinth of shipping containers and warehouses.

As we reach a deadend in the maze of containers, I can't shake the uneasy feeling settling in my gut as I step out of my car. "Thought we were going to see the Don," I call out, trying to keep my tone casual.

Águila glances back briefly. "We will. But first, a little detour. Gotta make sure you're still one of us."

"Since when do I need to prove that?" I shoot back.

He doesn't answer, instead stopping in front of a large, refrigerated container. The Hive's logo is stamped on the side—a friendly cartoon bee, smiling like this is just another delivery service. 

Two of his men move ahead, unlocking the heavy doors. A cloud of cold air billows out as they swings open, revealing darkness inside.

I hesitate. "What's this about?"

Águila steps aside, gesturing toward the open container. "Consider it a loyalty test."

A blast of cold air escapes, carrying with it a stench that hits me like a punch to the gut—a mix of decay and disinfectant that can only mean one thing.

Inside, the container is lit by harsh fluorescent lights that cast a sterile glow over a chilling scene. Rows of naked bodies hang from meat hooks embedded in the ceiling, their lifeless forms swaying slightly.

The corpses are a mix of men and women, their skins marked with tattoos that tell stories of allegiance—MS-13, Los Zetas, Norteños, or really anyone who dared cross paths with the Sinaloa.

The bodies show signs of torture—deep lacerations, burns, limbs twisted at unnatural angles. Some are missing fingers, others eyes. Each with a bullet hole at the base of the skull.

The sight hits me like a freight train, and suddenly I'm back in that warehouse during the Vásquez massacre. The screams, the gunfire, the metallic scent of blood—it's all crashing over me. My chest tightens, and for a moment, I can't breathe. The edges of my vision blur, and the faces of the hanging bodies start to morph into those of my family.

Audrey notices me falter. "Ramón, you okay?" she whispers.

I shake my head, trying to snap out of it. "Yeah, just... I’m fine."

After the massacre, the nightmares started. My shrink said I had PTSD and handed me a prescription. Tried them for a while, but the meds messed with my head even more—made me feel like a zombie. So I ditched them and turned to other means to keep the demons at bay. Whiskey usually does the trick, at least enough to get me through the night.

I raise my gun instinctively. 

Águila holds up a hand. “Relax, amigos," he says with that same sick smile. "You’re not joining them today. Not if you play your cards right.”

I lower my weapon slightly, though I don’t holster it.

Águila steps further inside, motioning for us to follow. I glance at Audrey, who gives a tight nod, and we move in behind him, boots clanging against the metal floor of the container. At the far end, two men in blood-splattered aprons are standing over a middle-aged man, bound and badly beaten. His face is swollen beyond recognition, the skin around his eyes a mottled purple-black, his lips split and bloody.

“You remember Mateo, don’t you, Castillo?” Águila asks, gesturing to the guy like he’s presenting a prize calf.

I stare at him, his battered face barely recognizable under the bruises and blood. His swollen eyes struggle to focus, but when they lock onto mine, a flicker of fear flashes across them.

"Mateo," I say softly. His head lifts slowly at the sound of his name, eyes struggling to focus.

"Ramon?" he croaks, voice barely audible over the hum of the cooling units. "Please... help me."

Mateo Cruz wasn’t just some run-of-the-mill lawyer; he was the Don’s go-to fixer, a man with a reputation for making legal problems disappear before they even made it to court. He knew the inner workings of the Sinaloa like the back of his hand—who was in charge of what, where the money flowed, which cops were on the payroll. If anyone ever got too curious, Mateo made sure they never asked a second question.


About a year before the Vásquez debacle, I’d uncovered a secret that Mateo had been double-dealing, feeding intel to Luis Colón, a rival Sinaloa capo who’d been circling for the top spot like a vulture ever since El Chapo got arrested. Cruz was giving him the keys to the kingdom, hoping to jump ship when the dust settled. 

But he’d gotten sloppy. I was the one who exposed him. I fed just enough evidence to Don Manuel, making sure Mateo's betrayal would come to light. The Don took care of the rest.

Águila leans against the doorframe of the refrigerated container, arms crossed. “You see, Castillo, Mateo here made a mistake. A big one. He forgot where his loyalties lie.”

Mateo’s eyes widen as he turns to me, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. “Ramón, please… I didn’t—”

“Shut him up,” Águila snaps, his voice cold. One of the men in aprons steps forward, slamming a fist into Mateo’s gut. He doubles over, gasping for air, tears mixing with the blood smeared across his swollen face.

Águila steps closer to me, lowering his voice. “The Don’s orders were clear. Cruz here is a traitor. You know what that means.”

My hand tightens around the grip of my Glock. 

"Ramon, you can't do this." Audrey grabs my arm, her eyes searching mine, silently begging me to remember who I used to be. 

Mateo’s on his knees now, sobbing, his body trembling with fear. “Ramón, please… I have a family. My little girl—she’s only four. You know me, hermano. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”

His words stab at me, but I keep my expression blank, shutting out the emotion. I’ve been in this situation before, too many times. There’s always a sob story, always someone with a family, someone who didn’t mean for things to go wrong. 

"Listen, Aguila," I say, turning to face him while keeping Mateo in my peripheral vision. "Killing Cruz isn't just about offing a traitor. Think about the fallout. Colón's been itching for a reason to challenge the Don. We hand him this, and he'll rally every dissatisfied soldier to his side. Blood will spill on every corner from Tijuana to Guadalajara. The last thing Don Manuel needs is a civil war tearing us apart from the inside."

"You think too much, cuante.” Aguila smirks. “Pull the trigger, or you can forget about meeting Don Manuel. Carajo, you can forget about walking out of here."

I glance at Audrey, her eyes locked on mine, a silent plea hidden in their depths. She knows what’s coming, but she’s leaving the choice to me. Her hand hovers over her gun, ready for anything.

I raise my Glock, but before I can act, Aguila shakes his head and gestures toward one of his men. "Too loud," he says. The sicario steps forward, handing me a Beretta fitted with a suppressor.

“Make it clean,” Aguila adds.

Mateo’s breath is ragged, his swollen face trembling as he continues to sob, his voice barely holding together. "Ramón, please…I swear, I—"

“Shut the fuck up!” I snap, my voice low but firm. For a moment, there’s silence. He looks up at me, his chest heaving, a glimmer of hope flickering in his eyes like maybe—just maybe—there’s a chance I’ll spare him. There’s not.

“Stand up and die like a man,” I order, my tone cold, detached. 

Mateo stares at me, his body shaking as he struggles to his feet. It’s a pitiful sight—his legs barely hold him up, the chains clanking against the metal floor as he rises, his breath shallow and panicked. 

“I don’t deserve this... my little girl,” he whispers again.

“Stop it,” I say, the barrel of the Beretta mere inches from his forehead.

My finger hovers just above the trigger, ready, waiting. But for a brief second, I hesitate, lowing my weapon.

“Shoot him,” Águila growls, stepping closer. His tone is casual. “Like you did that pig at the warehouse.”

The flashback hits me like a freight train. One moment, I’m standing in front of Mateo, my finger hovering over the trigger. The next, I’m back in that godforsaken warehouse, the night of the Vásquez ambush.

It was supposed to be a straightforward takedown—a sting operation designed to catch the Sinaloa Cartel with their pants down. But I knew it wasn’t going to go down like that. I’d made sure of it.

I had tipped off Vásquez about the raid, just enough to keep him ahead of the feds. He was supposed to slip away quietly, leave the heat behind for us to clean up. But that’s not what happened.

The warehouse was a killing floor as the cartel ambushed the task force. Bodies piled up, law enforcement and cartel soldiers alike, gunned down in a hail of bullets. I can still hear the sound of automatic weapons echoing off the concrete walls, the wet thud of bodies hitting the ground. The screams. The chaos.

As the dust settled, the cartel wasn’t about to leave any loose ends. They went around executing the wounded. No mercy, no hesitation. A bullet to the head for every cop lying on the floor, gasping for breath.

I was making my way through the carnage when I saw him—Officer Dominguez, my friend and colleague. He was lying against a pile of crates, clutching his side, his face pale and slick with sweat. A bullet had torn through his gut, leaving him bleeding out on the ground. His breaths were shallow, each one a struggle.

Audrey was right behind me, her eyes darting between Dominguez and the approaching cartel soldiers. She looked at me, her voice frantic. “We’ve got to get him help. We can’t just leave him here.”

“He’s seen too much,” I said, my voice flat, the reality of the situation sinking in.
I crouched down next to Dominguez, my face calm, my voice steady. “You’re gonna be okay, buddy,” I lied, placing a hand on his shoulder.

His eyes were filled with hope, desperate and pleading. “Ramón, I—”

I didn’t let him finish. In one smooth motion, I pulled my Glock from its holster, pressed the barrel against his forehead, and pulled the trigger.

I haven't been able to fire a weapon since that day. Not even on the range. Every time I feel the cold metal of a trigger beneath my finger, I’m back in that warehouse, with Dominguez's blood on my hands.

But as I hold Aguila’s pistol, something about it feels... off. I've been around firearms long enough to know when something’s not right. The balance isn’t there, the heft of live rounds missing from the magazine.

Though I could be wrong. There’s only one way to know for sure.

Mateo is praying under his breath. His words spill out in rapid-fire Spanish, a mess of pleas and promises that fall on deaf ears.

I raise the Beretta again, leveling it at his head. His sobs get louder, more frantic, as he realizes what’s happening. He doesn’t try to run, though. They never do. They just beg, as if there’s still a chance. 

My finger rests on the trigger, and I can feel the familiar pressure beneath it. Just a slight squeeze, and it’s over.

As I stand there, Mateo's face begins to blur. My vision swims, and for a moment, I think it's just the fluorescent lights messing with me. But then his features start to shift—skin sagging, eyes sinking back into his skull. The bruises and cuts fade, replaced by ashen flesh stretched tight over bone.

"Ramón," he rasps, but it's not Mateo's voice anymore. It's deeper, filled with a haunting echo.

I blink hard, trying to clear my head. When I open my eyes, I'm no longer looking at Mateo. Instead, Officer Dominguez stands before me, his uniform tattered and stained with dark, dried blood. A gaping gunshot wound pierces his forehead, the edges ragged, with bits of bone and brain matter oozing out. His eyes—cloudy and lifeless—lock onto mine.

"Why did you do it?" Dominguez asks, his voice carrying the weight of the grave. "We were partners. Friends."

My heart pounds in my chest, every beat echoing in my ears like a drum. "This isn't real," I mutter under my breath. "You're dead."

He takes a step closer, chains clinking softly. "Dead because of you," he hisses. "You gonna shoot me again? Go ahead. Pull the trigger."

I glance around, and the horror deepens. The bodies hanging from the meat hooks are moving now, their limbs twitching, heads lifting. Sunken eyes fixate on me, and mouths begin to move, whispering in a chilling chorus.

"Traitor."

"Murderer."

"Justice will find you."

Their voices blend together, a haunting melody that fills the cold air. The walls of the container seem to close in, the fluorescent lights flickering overhead. My grip on the gun tightens, palms slick with sweat.

"¡Basta!" (Enough!) I shout, raising the gun and pressing the barrel against his forehead, right where the wound gapes. 

I pull the trigger.

Nothing happens.

No recoil, no sound—just a hollow click echoing in the cold space.

Dominguez tilts his head, that ghastly smile widening. "What's wrong? No bullets?"

A wave of panic surges through me. I pull the trigger again. Click. And again. Click.

He leans in, his face inches from mine. "You can't escape this," he whispers.

I stagger back, and in a blink, he's gone. Mateo is back, crumpled on the floor, his eyes wide with fear and confusion.

"Por favor, Ramón," he pleads, his voice small and desperate.

My hands tremble as I lower the useless weapon. Sweat beads on my forehead, and I can feel every eye in the room on me. The whispers have stopped; the hanging bodies are once again lifeless.

Águila's laugh fills the cold air of the container, low and cruel, as I drop the empty gun.

“Good to see you still got ice in your veins, Castillo,” he says, crossing his arms over his broad chest. “You passed the test.”

Águila turns to the men in the blood-splattered aprons, who have been silently standing by, watching the entire scene unfold. "Cut off one of his fingers," he orders casually, as if he’s telling them to clean up a spill. "Send it to Colón as proof that we have one of his guys. Let him know we're open to negotiations."

One of the men steps forward without hesitation, pulling a pair of heavy-duty shears from his belt. He grabs Mateo’s hand, forcing it down on the metal table. 

“No, no, please—” Mateo’s voice cracks.

The man grips Mateo’s pinky finger, the shears poised to cut.

I glance at Águila, who’s watching with cold indifference. “Enough games, Pagán. I need to see Vásquez.”

"Alright, sure, come on," Águila says, nodding for me to follow him, as if the gruesome display isn’t happening just a few feet away. "Don Manuel’s expecting you."

As we step out of the container, I hear the snap of the shears cutting through bone and tendon, followed by Mateo’s scream—a raw, animalistic sound of agony. The door swings shut behind us, muffling the noise but not enough to block it [out](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/) [completely](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/18fgwud/i_was_stranded_in_the_australian_outback/).
