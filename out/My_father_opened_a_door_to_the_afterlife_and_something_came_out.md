My father was what you'd call a scientist. Well, a mad scientist was what my mother used to call him. They divorced when I was 7.

My dad has always been peculiar. He was always out doing new "experiments".

This afterlife fiasco started one year ago. 

He was in a hit and run and on the way to the hospital, he flatlined. His heart stopped for two minutes, the doctors informed me. He was in the ICU for over three weeks.

After he got discharged from the hospital, he was in a ..daze you could say. He was always just zoning out as if he were somewhere else.

It was a Sunday morning.

"I want to reexperience death" 

"What?", surely I must have heard wrong. He was not that crazy, was he?

"Death. I want to feel it again", there was a smile on his face.

"Dad, are you crazy? You died once and you want to what.. die again?"

"Mike, you don't understand. When I was dead, I was in a different world. A world where anything I wanted was possible, a world where I was happy. A world beyond death. Nothing's going to stop me from experiencing it again. Not even you"

Dad had a crazed look in his eyes. I knew better than to engage with him when he was like this, it would end up bad. So I begrudgingly kept my silence.

The experiments soon started. How did I know? I began finding dead rats in the trash. He really didn't have a good way of taking out his experiment failures. 

Small animals like rats would be thrown in the trashcan, he would always have an excuse for it, "just say we're using rat poison as we have a rat problem". Larger animals were buried in the forest out back.

His lab, which was professionally constructed, was in the basement and had top tier equipments. He did work for some bigshot corporation before his accident, so money was never an issue.

I began seeing dad less and less. He was spending day and night in his lab, doing God knows what. I don't think he was getting any sleep.

It was almost a month later I saw him. I was going down to the kitchen to get something for breakfast and dad was sitting in the breakfast nook.

"Mike, honey, how've you been?" 

Dad looked worn out, dark circles under his eyes, all skin and bones but his eyes were glowing with excitement.

"Good. You look.... tired"

He laughed so hard tears came out of his eyes. I haven't heard him laugh like that in so long.

"You could say that. But I'm almost done now, I'm so close to success. I just need a little bit of your help in the last step", he grinned.

I had forgotten for a moment what his experiment was about, but the mention of success was a stark reminder that my dad was trying to kill himself.

Dad noticed the frown on my face, "Mike, I'm sure you don't understand my thinking,but I want to see if the world I saw when I was dead real or if it was just a fluke. This'll be a groundbreaking finding that life beyond death is real. Do you not want to know if Mia got to  experience that place?"
 
Mia was my little sister who died when she was 3 and I was 6. She drowned in our pool. My mother blamed my dad for leaving the door to the pool room unlocked. This ultimately led to their divorce. 

Dad knew Mia was my weak point. So whenever I was reluctant, he'd bring up Mia.

"So what? You want me to kill you?", I glared at him.

"No, no. I've got that part handled. I just need you to bring me back to life 5 minutes after I die"

"You know this is insane, right? What if you die? What if I can't bring you back? Dad, please stop. This isn't right. It's dangerous"

"MIKE! Either you help me or I'll bring someone else to do it", he growled.

"Fine, bring someone. I'm not gonna play a part in your death", I glared at him.

Dad gritted his teeth and went to his lab, slamming the basement door on his way.

Three days later, Dad brought home a man in his late forties, an ex-coworker, he said.

"We're doing this experiment today, you're welcome to watch", he was visibly vibrating with excitement.

The two of them then made their way to the lab. My stomach was feeling funny, I was jittery. This is a bad idea, I wanted to scream.

I don't know how long passed, but I made my way down to the basement. Dad was strapped on to a table, arms and legs bound. A cardiac monitor was reading his vitals and there was even an IV going into his arm.

"Nice of you to finally join us", the man, Henderson as his name tag on the coat read, gave me a side eye.

Henderson then injected a green liquid into my dad's IV.

"What's that?" I asked.

"A special concoction made by your father. A drug that gradually stops the heart for only a few minutes. It's quite amazing really, it has no known side effects and the half life is very...." , I drowned out the rest of his voice and looked at my dad.

For someone who was going to die, he looked unusually happy. 

"Henderson may babble a lot but let him do his job. I'll be fine", the words didn't feel all that reassuring at all.

Suddenly the machines began to beep loudly and dad looked weakened.

"What's going on?" I asked Henderson.

"It's fine, his heart rate is falling which means the drug is working. His heart is gonna stop soon. We'll have to start resuscitation at the 4min 30sec mark"

A long beep filled the room.

"Starting the countdown now", Henderson clicked a button on his watch and got to work. 

He moved swiftly and arranged the defibrillator near to my dad and began placing the electrodes on him.

"Now, we wait"

It was only a few minutes but time was crawling awfully slow. Dad looked peaceful. Henderson kept glancing at the watch. My heart was pounding so hard, it felt like my chest would burst open.

"Time's up, move!" Henderson's voice jolted me. 

"I'm gonna give him a shock now, move your hands away from him", Henderson ordered.

Dad's body rose a few inches as the electric current passed through him, but the monitor still read a flat line.

"Again" Henderson called out.
"Again"
"Again"

Finally after the fifth shock, dad's heart restarted. I had tears streaming down my face.

"I thought I lost you too", I cried as I hugged him.

"I'm fine", Dad rasped.

The rest of what happened was a blur. Henderson was checking Dad and asking questions. I quietly drifted upstairs and just sat down on the living room couch. 

I just watched my dad die and then be brought back to life all for an experiment. I think I'm gonna be sick.

Hours passed with me just sitting there. I didn't notice when Henderson went home.

Dad sitting next to me jolted me from my daze. 

"You're not gonna ask if it worked?" he nudged me with a shoulder.

"You'll say it anyway, right?"

"Well, you've got me all figured out Mike. I saw it, kiddo. I saw the place again, it wasn't a fluke. I felt happy and at peace there. It felt like I could do anything and everything. Life after death exists. And I saw her."

A slow feeling of dread enveloped me, "Saw her? Saw who?"

"Mia. She was there. She's grown up now though. She looks a lot like you. Said she's lonely there and misses all of us, especially you, Mike"

"Dad, stop this nonsense", I felt my ears ringing.

"But it's true. Mia was there and she wanted to come back with me"

"STOP! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE!" My throat felt raw after screaming. I didn't want to be there anymore, I bolted to my room. Talking about Mia was too much.

____________________________________________

That night I had a dream, I was in a field, the grass so green and the sky so blue, it looked surreal. A girl maybe my age or younger was standing facing away from me.

"Why did you kill me, Mike?",her voice was soft.

It took a second for a words to register, "What?", my voice was a whisper.

The figure turned around. It was like looking at a mirror but at a younger female version of me.

"Why did you kill me?" The girl screamed so loud I thought my ear drums would burst.

I jolted awake from my dream.

Mia. The girl was Mia. I didn't know how I knew that, but that was Mia.

But I didn't kill her, no, no , I didn't. I just forgot to close the door to the pool room and she wandered in. She wasn't even supposed to be there. It wasn't my fault. It wasn't.

"Yes, it was", the voice was faint but I could clearly make out Mia's voice.

I screamed. I screamed loud. 

Dad came rushing in, "Mike, what's wrong?"

"Nightmare" I managed to say. I didn't want to say I heard Mia's voice, that might even be a hallucination I had due to the fear, right?

"Aren't you a little too old for nightmares, kiddo?" He ruffled my hair.

"Mike, what's this? Why is your ears bleeding?"

I slowly touched my ears and my fingers came back coated with blood. "I don't.. I don't know"

We went to the ER that night. No serious damages. We came back home early morning.
The lights in my room were switched on, but I clearly remembered switching them off when going to the hospital.

From that night I have been sleeping in the living room.

Mia or whatever it is, has been visiting me everyday in my sleep. Says since I killed her, I should also die. That I don't deserve to live.

The house also feels different, like something is just wrong. It feels like something sinister, something evil is in here. I don't know if dad's noticed it yet, I haven't really seen him in a few days. I feel like I'm going crazy.

And I saw her yesterday, Mia, I mean. This time it was not in my dreams. I was having dinner in the kitchen and I heard a noise. When I looked back, she was just standing there, holding a knife. I haven't slept since then. 

I'm currently sitting in the living room. My back to the wall. I don't want to fall asleep. I don't think I'll wake up again if I sleep.
