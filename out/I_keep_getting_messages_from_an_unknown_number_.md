This will have to be as concise as I can be, as I have to act now. I know this is going to sound out there, but its true. I feel less like myself than ever and my memories are becoming clouded. The only thing I can vividly remember are three words, etched into my mind. Don’t trust him. He’s not me.



 \-



I was a man of routine, arguably a predictable and mundane lifestyle, which I was used to. Every morning I’d wake up at 7:00, shower, make a cup of tea and be out for 8:00. My workday was as eventful as an invoice clerk could be. I’d eat my pre-packed sandwiches that I’d made the night before and keep a reasonable work flow through the day. Each week flowed the same way, work Monday to Friday, watch my local football team on the Saturday and play for my local Sunday league team the following day, all for it to start up the next week. In all honesty my life had plateaued, though I wasn’t really looking to spice it up in any meaningful way. 



One late Sunday evening, after unloading my weeks shopping from my small 2 door ford fiesta, I thought I saw a man leaning against a lamppost. He stood, slightly slumped on the opposite side of the street to my drive. I initially didn’t pay very much attention to him, to be honest I don’t think I even saw him at first. However, he seemed a little off. The best way I can describe it was that he seemed fuzzy, almost like his proportions were fluctuating, never settling on a form, yet staying vaguely human in shape. Passing it off at the time, I stepped inside and began unpacking as I did the Sunday evening prior. 



Waking the following Monday, my routine was altered ever so slightly by the existence of a new message, from a number I didn’t recognize. From what I could make out, it was just a random string of letters, numbers and the occasional piece of interspersed punctuation. Thinking back, it was almost as if the message and subsequent correspondences were an alien’s first attempts at communication using a phone keypad. Regardless, those handful of seconds sat at the edge of my bed reading weren’t going to cause me to leave any later as I proceeded with my morning routine. 



Throughout the week, I would receive a new message daily. Each one, more legible as it spelled out an ominously threatening phrase. ‘Like your life. Want it’. I’d not been pranked in a long time, let alone been close enough to anyone who’d pull something of this nature. Hesitation wasn’t something I was used to either, but I could feel my mind actively repelling the thought to respond. 

It could have been a couple of days, but since that message it felt as if the person on the other end was goading me to respond. Each message felt more personal, things like; ‘Red Car’, ‘Kick ball’ and ‘Blue tie’. I don’t know if the person was following me or just knew me and was regurgitating things for a pitiful response, but I gave it to them. ‘What do you want?’ Previously I would have just deleted the number and blocked them by now, though I was stirred on by something. Maybe it was the uncharacteristic curiosity I was feeling or maybe I was just happy with something to add to my monotonous day. Regardless, the instant I sent it, I received a call from that number. 



At the time I panicked, messaging was one thing but a call with a completely faceless stranger and their unknown intentions, count me out. That was the first escalation, each evening I’d receive a call-in place of my previously scheduled text. The courage to answer always seemed to be absent, however for once, a slight change in its routine made me bite. Four words that chilled me and which I wasn’t prepared to read, though compelled me to attempt to get answers. ‘I can see you.’



I answered. Asking that same question, “what do you want?” 

At first all I heard was what I can only describe as a low-pitched buzz you’d hear from an old porch light. It flickered in and out from the buzz to the sound of a person breathing out and making a droning err sound. 

After a couple of minutes, I asked again, “what do you want and why are you following me?” 



However, I got nothing but short interspersed errs. The call had gone on for at least 5 minutes by that time and I was ready to go to bed and get my scheduled 8 hours of sleep. Ending the call and completing my regular ‘before bed routine’, I slipped under the covers and closed my eyes. In hindsight, I don’t think I processed what I was hearing, but as I drifted off, I swear I could still hear the faint droning sound from that call. Though this time it seemed louder. 



The previous night’s antics caused me to have an uncharacteristically restless sleep, something that didn’t start my day off well. It lingered around me all day, like I’d been drained of my energy. My workflow dropped and I felt hungry the entire day, to the point I bought from the office vending machine, something I’d not done once prior. Finally reaching my house that evening, I was awash with relief. That day had dragged, however the final nail in my coffin was waiting for me as the door crashed shut. Another call. 



I was startled at first, the long day had me thinking of anything but another meaningless call, but they had been waiting for the instant I was back. Whether it was my lethargy or the climax of the week’s events, I retaliated. 

“What! What the fuck do you want? I’ve had enough of this shit, just tell me.” 



Silence, followed by a monotone wheezing voice. It spoke in the manor a non-native English speaker would, however there was no accent, almost as if this were its first words. 

“Waaaa ck, chh, watch. uh, you. See you. Let me in.”



A sudden thump echoed from my sliding glass door. In an instant my head swiveled to stare into the inky blackness of my back garden. 

“What … what the fuck do you want” I pleaded as my voice was engulfed by the empty night. 



The flickering porch light illuminating barely two feet from the patio window. Shadows danced in my mind as it attempted to conjure a horrifying entity, just out of sight. The next thing I heard sent an ice-cold chill, which pierced me to the bone. In a growling aggressive and brittle, but perfect copy of my voice. 

“Want in … want in … want to be … YOU”. 



I don’t remember anything else from that night. Simply waking up in my bed with a splitting headache and an aching pain in my neck, assuming I’d dreamed that up. Though as I tried and failed to complete my morning routine, I caught it in the corner of my eye. The patio door was ever so slightly a-jar. 



My mind was scrambled and for once I was contemplating calling in sick. As I sat, pondering whether I could really break my 3 years stretch without a day off, I relented and dialed my offices number. Maybe it was just the last couple of days, but the introduction of such a normal voice over the phone startled me. 



“Hi Sam, why are you phoning?” Amy asked in a questioning tone. “Hi … erm, sorry I don’t think I can come in today, my head is killing me. I think I’ve got a migraine.”  

Quickly and very matter-of-factually she responded. “Sam, you’re not really one for jokes, are you? I’ve just seen your car pull into the car park. Look, I’ll see you in a minute.” 

I had no clue what she was talking about, but as I looked out of the lounge window, I stared out to an empty drive. 



Questioning the night before. Had I really just dreamed it. Whoever was calling, had they robbed me and stolen my car? For what, just to go to my work? Checking my call logs, I had in fact answered their call that night. Slumping back in my chair, I recalled what they’d said. They really wanted to have my life, my mundane, predictable, simple life. The beating pain in my head, trying its hardest to block my train of thought. They’d been watching, recording? All to replace me in my own life. 



I got changed as fast as I possibly could and ran out to get the next bus to the office. The entire trip, I milled it over in my already fracturing head. What did it really want? My life wasn’t amazing, nothing worth stealing, was it? And what would I do when I actually confronted them. Regardless as I stepped into the car park and eyed out my vehicle. This must have been their plan from the start, and with that thought and the pain in my head, an unfamiliar anger welled up. 



Reaching the front door, I slipped out my wallet to find an empty slit where my key card should have been. Frantically searching every inch, it wasn’t there. A rage welled up within me again as my hands balled into fists and I pounded the glass.



 “Hey, someone let me in. Amy, Rob, someone!” I yelled like I hadn’t before. My head and this unfolding situation had begun to break me. 

A younger man emerged from one of the downstairs offices, he looked uncomfortable to say the least. 

Yelling and pointing at him, “Hay you open the door!” 

He must have been new, maybe even an intern, but my anger and his naivety resulted in me storming up the staircase and bursting through our office door. 



Amy spotted me instantaneously and in a joking tone, “Sam? Why did you get changed? And when did you leave?” 

I paid no attention to her as I rounded the corner of the conference room to lock eyes with the person sitting at my desk. 



It was me. I mean, it wasn’t a perfect copy, but you could easily have mistaken us for twins. My disbelief momentarily being cut off as Rob chimed in. 

“What the fuck is this? Sam why didn’t you tell anyone you had a brother? He’s not much of a looker though, well that’s an understatement, hahaha.” He chuckled mockingly as he had many times before. 

The person before me definitely looked like me, though his movements were uncanny, almost robotic. His body snapped into place as he turned to face me in one smooth motion. A practically perfect impression of my voice came from its open mouth.  

“What do you want?”



This was the same person who I’d been conversing with and as it spoke a twisted, curved smile contorted itself into place. He … it knew how angry and terrified this situation had me. Though as its eyes locked on to mine and we stared into each other’s souls, I knew it didn’t have good intentions. In a rush of adrenaline, I struck. Lunging forward and connecting a clean right hook to its jaw. As it spun and the force sent its head swinging out to my left, the smile never faded. I’d never so much as pushed someone, let alone thrown a punch. The force I exerted, had me recoiling my arm in pain. Its skin reminded me of soft clay and its elasticity was identical. Its jaw was obviously broken, sitting at a 45° angle, though as my doppelganger realized that it was displaced, it pawed and grasped, pulling it back and fixing the mask of my face it wore. 



Both Rob and two other men grabbed and dragged me back to a ‘c’ shaped desk to restrain me, as Amy comforted the copy. 

“What the fuck Sam, isn’t this just a joke?” Amy pleaded as she looked down at me. 

As my eyes closed and I slipped down to the floor, the twisted fake smile still visible on ‘my’ face. It was evident I had played into whatever twisted plan it had been crafting.  



Waking in a sudden jolt, I felt my arms restrained to the hospital bed I was now laying on. Two officers stood inside the doorway to the bleached white room. 

“Don’t panic, you’re not going to be detained for long. We just want to know what went down from your side.” 



I didn’t think they’d believe a word of what actually happened, so I gave as much detail as I could, without making myself seem crazy. 

“That guy was impersonating me. He’d been following me for a while and ended up going to my work, I guess I just snapped,” I said frantically. 

They just looked at each other, then back at me. 

“That would be extremely hard, seeing as though you don’t technically exist.” 

Obviously, I existed. The look that was plastered on my face, invited the two officers to elaborate. 



“You’ve got no ID in your wallet, no credentials and from our records you’ve never worked a day or even owned a car.” 

My face crumpled yet again as the words they spoke didn’t compute. 

“I live at 42 meadow Lane, I work at Hammond LLC and I have for as long as I can remember.” 

The last part of that sentence hit me, I really couldn’t remember how long I’d actually been living and working there. My pounding head trying its hardest to block out any memory before that first message two weeks ago. 

One of the officers interjected, pausing my mania for a second. 

“Look, Mr. Mason isn’t pressing any charges, so you’re free to go. Just don’t go seeking him out again otherwise his leniency won’t cut it.”

As the men uncuffed me from the bed, a thought cut through the migraine, I was Samuel Mason, wasn’t I?



By that time it was dark, but as I left the hospital, I had only one destination in mind. I needed to speak to him, regardless of what the officers said, I wanted answers. Dragging myself the half hour to ‘my home’, I flipped through my phone and wallet. The physical wallet itself must have been mine, I’m pretty sure I remember pulling out my key card the previous weeks, however the cards themselves seemed fake. Some of them had no name or picture, others were just rectangles of solid white or black plastic. Even my phones contacts were listed with a multitude of random strings of numbers and letters where contact names and numbers should be. The only real thing was the conversation and list of calls with that number. Had it infected my phone? Replaced everything about me, become me … who was I then?



My scrambled mind and weary legs just about managed to drag me to the top of my street. Staring down, I must have done this an infinitesimal amount of times, however I had no recollection. I saw ‘my house’, and the lights were on. My car sat motionless on the drive as I stepped around the back of the house and peered in through the patio window. The silhouette of a figure stood at the kitchen counter, facing away from me. It seemed to be chopping something. Although as I stared harder it was evident that the figure was simply holding a vegetable and repeatedly, in a rhythmic fashion slapping the knife against the chopping board in a foe cutting motion. 



The drone of the patio light and my thumping head caused my vision to blur slightly as I raised a hand and brushed my upper face and eyes. As they refocused on the figure it had stopped. With its body still as a mannequin, it spoke, in an identical copy of my voice. 

“Are you following me?” 

Those words, they were mine, just like back at the office that day. As it spoke, it craned its neck back at an impossible angle, to face the patio window and simultaneously my head began to beat harder and harder, threatening to crack. This time I stared not at a similar recreation of my face, but rather an exact facsimile. As I looked deep into my own eyes, it smiled that same wicked smile and I faded. 



These stages of deliriousness had become all too common, how many times had I woken in an unknown place, I couldn’t recall. Raising from the dingy hotel room bed I surveyed my surroundings. This was where I’d been staying for the past week, or at least it seemed that way. My mind fractured like a mirror, scattered shards and missing memories. As I stood and stepped over to the small wooden table, I caught myself in the full-length mirror. I was a sad husk of a man, thin and sickly looking. Maybe my eyes just didn’t want to focus on this wretch I’d become, but my image in that broken mirror was fuzzy, barely resembling a human form. 



Checking my phone I’d been writing a log, seemingly to document my side of the situation. Evidently, I had nothing left to lose, what life I had I couldn’t remember, and that thing had replaced everything about me. Whatever strength I had left, it seemed I was mustering it up to face off with my copy tonight. A knife, hammer and tape all sat in a small black backpack next to the table leg, the tools I’d be utilizing to put a stop to this. 



I’m paraphrasing now, most of my notes are illegible and could easily be mistaken for a mad man’s ramblings. Nothing makes sense and any semblance of thought or reason was drowned out by the constant rhythmic pounding of my head. Hopefully you can empathize with my hopeless predicament, and I can take back what was lost. My every loosening grip and eroding memories left only one thought.



The last and most important thing I wrote, scribbled all over the walls and etched into my mind. The only thing I was holding onto. 

HE’S NOT ME



\-



Hi guys, this is Sam. I know this post has been very frantic and frankly quite disjointed. However, it seems that the crazed man who attacked me has been dealt with by the police. It also seems he was the one who was stalking me and had gone as far as impersonating me both online and in person. I’m thankful that I never deleted those messages or call logs, though it seems only fitting that they get erased just like he is. 



Seemingly that puts an end to this predicament, and somehow, I feel more rejuvenated.  Almost like my life is starting a new and I can throw out my old way of thinking. Maybe I’ll go for a promotion or ask out a girl, I don’t know really. Whatever it is I do, I’ll make sure I use this life better than the old version of me.



A question, maybe something he’d said or something I was toying with in my mind. ‘What do I want?’ Well, let’s just say, I’ll make the most of his life.
