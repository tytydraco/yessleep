Sharing memory number 1407: Rosa Moore.

Blood spilling form my arm, i reach to my screwdriver, unactivating the drill seconds before it reached the center of the planet. The fire engulps me and i start to think how did it come to this.

I came from a wealty family in virginia, spending my life playing with radios. I was the popular girl in school, but suddently lost all popularity when i was diagnosed with ADHD. Only god knows why my dad suggested i was put to work at a young age, forcing me to be at the radio station at the organization.

I am Rosa Moore, i was assigned to that quiet station, station number four, in which tragedy struck. Time at the radio was... Boring, with nothing to do all day long. I would have killed to have a better job, i started to secretly envy everyone. Maybe this is the reason that day i was disrtaught... Maybe i did not care enough for Mark to send an immediate alarm. All i know is, my stupidity, my envy, my hatred for my job, is what brought me to eventual death.

I did not know of the hive mind project until, for the heat generated by the incident, i was assigned to the termination team, which was somehow even worse than the radio.

"For Humanity and the World!" was our motto, jeez, i heard that stupid phrase at least a thousand times altready.

My pain did not las long, i died in about 5 missions, which is cool for me, at least i died like a hero...

Roosa Moore died of extreme heat, while deactivating a drill directed to the center of the earth. World end corp. needs further investigation, and the superiors of the company have supposed fleed from the scene, without any further trace left, most of the people working there were arrested, for now, the threat is deemed neutralized. Rosa's family was told that she died of a mysterious plague, during a trip to [data expunged from high clearance station]. They were given her ashes after two weeks.

These files MUST remain in full secrecy until humanity doesn't die and the new species take full control over the planet.

E.N: The end is not today, thanks Rosa.
