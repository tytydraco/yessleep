Have you ever heard of stories about secret government prisons or a town full of demonic forces or a woman with a strange tattoo that connects to some sort of god? If so, you might as well expect this one to be kinda just like them. But instead I monitor a ton of entities none of us will ever believe.

I work at a secret prison in the deepest oceans, far from all the continents of earth. I can't tell you a lot about our location(It's classified information). And no, this is not conducted by the government, instead this has been started from an unknown identity. Nobody ever knew who started all of this. Although there are higher executives who have communication with that person, mostly it's all on the status of the entire prison and the secrecy.

My job is to monitor the entities from different cells, the cells that are on my list to monitor. Whenever there is an escape attempt or any suspicious activity, I have to warn the entire facility to prepare to catch them. This doesn't happen very often, which I kinda lost that alerting sense in my head. It's been over like 2 years, there hasn't been anything wrong happening, well, just on my list. Others who monitor other cells have a different experience. One of them often alerted the facility with sheer annoyance, and the others had a terrible experience; kinda like the mobile game of an animatronic lookout at night after 12.

I've slacked off for a very long time: Watching the entities like watching a movie, daydreaming, sleeping, playing on my switch, playing with my pistol I got for emergencies, and listening to music. I love listening to game music. They had this amazing rhythm that just tells the story of the character so well, sometimes at best. They express that voice the characters in games couldn't sing; the song that sings their hearts. And the instruments they use fits so well to the background of games. Shit, even bad piggies main theme is so good.

Whoops, excuse me for saying so much of that stuff.

There are many kinds of entities with terrifying phenomena, full of mysteries I still wonder behind my head. None of the researchers could get a single evidence of their origins, which leaves us to wonder. Some of them are silent cold, staring at the walls, themselves, and even the cameras which sometimes make me shiver at times. Some didn't do much; they just stood or sat on the ground silently, with the intention to be free once again. But some are much more active by running around madly, screaming, jumping around like total maniacs, sheathing their steel weapons, you name it.

Mostly they were talking in a language most of us don't understand. Nevertheless, an alien language. The translators have worked hard to understand each sound of their language, even tried to communicate with them with pictures, objects, hand gestures, and expressions. That only works with a few of the entities. A lot of them would just maul, torture, crush, and so on.

Before I got this job, I was met with a well suited man, with sunglasses that hid away what dark secrets stood behind his eyes. We just chatted in the middle of the public restaurant as if it's normal. He just spoke about things that people should find strange, but nobody seemed to care at all. I didn't believe him at first. He gave me the location of where the prison is. And as you already know, I took this job without a hesitation.

Why? I was looking for a job and there was nowhere for me to stay. I got kicked out of my parents house; knowing that I'm a big disappointment to them. I'v always been their disappointment, even at the very beginning. They even tell that I shouldn't have been born right at my face when I was just fucking 5 years old for godsake. I've been looking for jobs and yet there wasn't any that wanted me in. I was just another loser in society.

Besides, the job here pays well. Each month I can go out into the world for 3 days off. That's how I got my own phone, switch, and games. fashions aren't my thing. I always see them as a distraction, something to cope with whatever state people are in society. And I hope you understand that I don't visit my parents ever. I did see them once, but it's not interactive. I saw that they had another child. The child became their one and only perfect child. Of course, I was pissed, but why should I be? I should just let that slide and begone. After all, they never wanted me in the beginning. But inside, I wished they had accepted me. But of course, they'll never.

I don't really have any friends around the facility. I tried at the gym, but nobody seems to accept me. I wish I had someone to talk to, but I guess I'll never. I never had friends in the time of my school years. They always see me as some loser who couldn't even accomplish anything, other than daydream in class. Every time whenever I open my locker there are piles of paper that read 'fucking loser', 'useless', and 'procrastinating sucker'. But for some reason, everyday I felt someone was there for me at the worst of times. Like a guardian angel of some sort. I don't know why. That somehow makes me keep going in life.

I am, however, in a healthy shape. Everyday, the commander on the speakers tells everyone to go move. It means I have to go exercise at my designated gym. There are a ton of soldiers, agents, scouts, engineers, scientists, biologists, everyone. The reason why everyone must go to the gym is really interesting. I asked an executive why once, and they said. "This is to make sure we have good shape, to defend ourselves if anything dangerous has occurred. But mostly, it's a fight or flight protocol.

"You see, we have designed the gyms with a special effect, making us durable against high level threats. Just like the ones in the cell. And don't worry, everything, even the walls, are sound proof and protected from entities that try to hear us from afar. And the cameras are fully protected with special gears. Now, get back to moving!" As much as I liked to believe that, I sometimes worry that I might be watched or heard, even if they're protected. Entities have their own ways of gaining intelligence from the world. And the mystery behind them is what really halts the gears.

When I got the job and arrived at the location, I was introduced by 2 men escorting me to a boat. We traveled for a long period of time, and until we arrived, I had that sense of fear all over my nerve systems. It was a dock made of rotten old wood, across was a large box that towers over us. At first I thought it was just some gift, instead it was actually an elevator.

One man escorted me on the dock and led me to the elevator. The doors opened smoothly, and when I stepped in, the elevator immediately closed its doors and went down. Once the elevator stopped, the doors opened and I was met by a huge lobby, full of members all over the place. Some were wearing dark suits, military coats, tanks, hazard suits, and astronaut suits. This whole place felt alien at first, but as time went on, I got used to it and felt it more to be the environment I'm comfortable with. Before I was sent to my monitoring room, I was given a book by the same man I met from the restaurant. He gave me a large jaw dropping books(Full of knowledge) and sent me to my room; My new home.

He did elaborate when I didn't understand. "Our job here is to secure entities that are 'supernatural' to the society's reality. Whether human or not, they still pose a huge threat. We're still learning more about how they came to be, what they are, and why they came here. You can keep up with the entire facility if you read this book I gave you. These are the compendiums that contain different kinds of information. It's huge, yes, but you'll have enough time to get it all done.

"I want you to give notes about each and every page of this book. This is important. And keep an eye on the entities while you're at it." He gave me a stern look with a flat cold voice.

I don't know why, but somehow I was able to read so much of it that I struggle to take a break. As you might expect, it holds dozens of info, just like the devil's bible. Wait, no. It's more than that. This holds much much more than the devil's bible. It doesn't really hold into history, more of how they managed to capture them. Their abilities, health, activities, biology, and anatomy have been written down and copied on the pages. It took me well over a year and a half to get it all done. Seriously, there are dozens of things more than just entities. There are objects that hold an eerie capability. You can say that some can manipulate the psyche, or raise the blood temperature at its radius, or even summon a fucking dragon.

There's one more thing I should mention before I go on with my daily job routine. You may have heard that there are humans here. Why? Some of them don't really make any sense. The ones that have mixed concepts of reality.  Some have the ability to appear out of nowhere, just anywhere they want. Hell, they became a heavy target that the marines have to use their technology. And there are others who can fuck someones mind with incomprehensible nightmares.

Some humans did have a really good reason. They have those mutations, not from comics, it's an absolute unluckiest curse. It hurts me to know they had suffered terrible pain, mockery, and loneliness for their whole life. Some had an incurable mutation that grows limbs everyday, skinless, boneless, had allergies to their blood, twisting bones, and more other cruelest mutations god has ever designed. I hope that the scientists can help cure their deadly curse. For their pain to finally end.

And lastly, there are humans that just confuses me. They have some sort of connection to the astral plane, dimensions, galaxies, reality, or fucking aliens for crying out loud. Many of them are a bunch of mind fucked psychopaths. Researchers and marine soldiers would rather hang themselves than stay with them for years. And damn, I saw one smiling into the cameras, staring into my soul. I dare to hope that they never walk outside.

Yet there are few humans who aren't like that, in fact they're just clueless and huddled at the corner of the cell.

There's this one teen, who told them he had nothing to do with the supernatural. He said."Ok, look alright! You got it all wrong! I have no alien powers or fucking mind reading shit! I'm telling you, I'm just a regular old kid! I'm just a regular fucking senior high schooler!!" And you know what, they aren't convinced. I actually kinda believed what he said was true. All he did in his cell was pace back and forth, kicking the walls, counting sheep, going to the toilet, and so on.

I was sitting on my chair, listening to [goofy music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irQNALota_g) on loop. The walls were as gloomy as the dead, and so is the ceiling. But with the music beating my brain with its country tone, I quickly went daydreaming. I picture myself driving along a highway at the ocean side. The dawning sun shunned the ocean's surface, cooking it into a wonderful hue. By tipping the top of my dusk sunglasses, I look at my reflection, seeing a bright smile on my face as the wind brushes my face and brown hair.

Even though at the reflection of my mind I might look peaceful, that was just a mask. Behind it, I wished hard for someone to accept me. No, not just acceptance. I wanted to feel human, but somehow, god doesn't seem to give me that chance. Instead, everyone sees me as something to put all their pain, regrets, and hatred on me; to cope with themselves.

The ocean managed to see behind my mask and began to rise out of the earth. A face has grown on the moon's face, with eyes that spoke hatred and hollowness. The sky slowly glowed a dark crimson with the moon. Everything around me has turned into chaos and the car puffed a huge cloud of smoke from its headlights. I looked at my reflection to see that the mask had fallen, revealing my shame. The music stopped, leaving me with an empty world.

Then, all of the sudden, a loud bang rang my mind, pulling me back to the dark eerie prison. Damn that bang. I turned to see where the sound had come from. At cell 52, the entity was banging its head on the wall. Its head is the shape of an oval, with wires digging into its skin like worms. Its entire body is human, except for its hollow skin, which would be used as some sort of cup cover.

My whole body went alert, alert for what exactly? I rushed to the speaker button and pressed it with shaking hands. I had no idea why, all of the sudden my brain takes it as something deadly serious. "Uh...Inmate in cell 52 needs immediate checkup. I repeat, Inmate in cell 52 needs immediate checkup!" I pressed again and went back to the screen to find it still hurting itself. Then, it started releasing a high pitch scream.

This never happened before, never has been. This entity was left as a complete mystery, not even the writer for the compendium had an idea about it. This entity is called the monolith. All it does is nothing, standing motionless at its position. Many have tried to take a piece of its skin, but nothing has worked.

My brain keeps having this surge that makes me look around in a frantic motion, searching for the source. As I sat and watched, my left leg bouncing with energy. I didn't realize that everyone, and I also mean, every entity is having the same awareness as I have. They all began rushing around in their cells, banging out for an escape, scratching, screaming, and rocking back and forth. I'm beginning to realize that the monolith isn't just for display, it was a harbinger.

In a matter of seconds, a loud horn warns the entire facility. Behind the door were loud herds of footsteps rushing at caution. I thought they were going to cell 52, but I was wrong. A loud bellowing roar echoed the halls outside behind my door. Then there were gun fires and blood curdling screams of agony. My whole body shivers as I place my ears against the door. There were still gunshots when a disgusting tear of flesh and bone hit my mind.

Then, everything went silent, except for the horn and my hollow breathing. I stepped back slowly, hoping I didn't make a sound. I stood frozen in place. I wanted to hide, run, find somewhere for me to escape. But my whole entire body is frozen and my mind racing with terrible possibilities. I can hear something coming. I began hoping it would pass my room, ignoring my existence.

Then suddenly, there were dozens of loud noises behind the radio. I turned to look and saw that nearly every entity had escaped out of their cells. Some huddled in fear, while others rushed out and started creating a bloodbath. I felt my face run cold white when I saw that the monolith had written something down on the walls. '***REVELATION***'

Just as I was about to rush and turn off the radio, a cold boney hand gripped tight around my wrist and dragged me down to the ground. Then, something sharp pinned me down at the chest. I saw it was a tail and it started to dig inside my flesh. Before I could let out a scream, my eyes met with the terrifying monster's face. Its distorted skull is messed with bits of putrid flesh and tissue, with empty eyes that glares against all things living. Its torso is a spiral of bones from up to down, with a long menacing tail at its end.

I tried to let out something before I die, yet my voice caught in my throat. I wanted to look away, but its hands grasped my face, forcing me to stare. It's like I'm somehow staring at the face of death. When it opened its jaw, it breathed a fowl breath onto my face, making my stomach twist.

*"You shall witness a new future of the material world. Witness thy god rule humanity and create thine law."* It whispered with a wicked smile. I felt tears running down my face. I tried to say something, but in a quick motion it pierced through my flesh. My whole mind begins to blur as I was left to hear my own scream. My vision slowly starts to blur whilst staring into its empty eye sockets. My screams turned muffled. My whole life is coming to an end.

They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes. Looking back to your lovely and heartwarming memories as you start to lose consciousness. But this is not the point at all. Instead of that, there are flashes of memories we never remembered. The things we've forgotten what we've experienced. There are stupid memes about memes flashing before your eyes, which sounds bullshit.

Before my very own eyes, I saw a girl with a bright smile. I then realized this was when I was just a baby. My small hands and her big soft hand touched to a soft warmth. Even the walls are so depressing, as well as the light, her presence somehow gives me hope and faith. "I'm so lucky to have you, Phil."

Then, another vision flashed. I was a kid, walking alone on the road of the city. I felt my heart panic as I kept looking around for my sister. I was crying terribly as my legs begin to grow weak. Then I sat down on the hard floor, frightened of being alone from my big sister. "Phil! PHIL! Oh my god! Phil!" Her panicked voice echoed in front of me. I opened my eyes to see my sister running towards me. She then picked me up and hugged me tightly close. My tears falling onto her leather jacket. "Oh Phil! Please don't do that again! You had me scared to death!" She kissed me on the cheek and started carrying me wherever we went.

I don't remember having a sister. This doesn't make any sense. Throughout my whole entire life, I never once had a sister, just me. Why do I have those forgotten memories? Did something happen to her? I felt my chest start to beat with faith and motivation. I want to know about her, remember her. Where is she and why can't I remember her while I was alive?

Memories of my time with my sister showers my whole entire mind. In those visions, she helped me study, took me to parks, cuddled when I was in my depression moments, and I was at her wedding day. A man 6 foot tall wearing a dark polished suit with a bow tie that says 'king'. She was so beautiful, wearing a bright heavenly wedding dress that would belong to an angel, with a bright smile that gave me and everyone hope and faith.

I was also wearing a formal polish black suit, with a sunflower in my breast pocket. When they kissed, declaring their marriage has completed, everyone in the church jumped out of their benches and started praising. I was the most excited out of all of them, and I couldn't be more happy and proud of her.

Then, there was *this* vision. Before me was her own husband opening a portal from the ceiling. The bright heavenly portal shines on him like curtains of god. My sister lay on the ground with the expression of fear. "Iris?!" Her husband turned to face me with the look of excitement. "Oh! Hey there kid. Don't worry about us, we were just busy on something." He said with a wicked smile on his face.

I turned my head to see Iris looking at me with defeat. I looked back at her husband, to find him holding some sort of dagger. His arm is carved with some sort of sigil as blood drips down to his fingers. "What did you do to her?!" I nearly yelled at the top of my lungs. "Huh. Oh, I just had to give sense to her. Just that she uh...." At the corner of my eye, I saw Iris holding something bright in her hand. No, It wasn't an object. It was..."She's stressed. That's why she-" Iris leapt at him, cutting his sentence. In just a quick motion, she grabbed his face with hooked fingers. It was some sort of bright light that glowed on her palms. His scream was muffled, mixed with sizzling light as her palm burned his face.

I was still frozen in place when his whole body fell limply to the ground. His face was burnt to a fucking crisp, but instead of a human proportion, it was something alien. The muscles of his face are hollow like the depths of Sheol. My stomach churned as I tried to speak. "Iris! What.... What..."

She shushed me gently with her index finger touching the front of her lip. "I know. It's hard to believe. But, everything is going to be alright ok. I have to shut this portal off before they arrive."

"What?! What's going on, Iris?!" My voice trembled as I began to feel a terrible itch behind my head. "I wish I could explain." Her voice is somehow still soft and strong at the same time. Tears began running down her face as she tried to put up a smile. But the muscles of her lips quivered in fear. "But there's no time. I have to go."

"What!! To where?! You're not going to leave me! Take me with you! I can't be alone here without you! Without you, who's going to be there for me! Who's going to be-" Before I could say another, she rushed and hugged me tight. I wrapped my arms around her, desperate for her to not leave me. I felt my heart racing as I began to weep. "I'm so sorry, Phil. But I have to do this. For you. As soon as I close the portal, everyone, including you, will forget I ever existed."

"NO! NO! I won't! I won't forget! Please! Don't do this!" Her bright warm palm patted my head as she spoke with a broken voice. "Phil, you're 16. You're a grown up, and I'm so happy to see you grow. I'm sorry, but this is how it is." She begins to let go. I wanted to keep hugging her, but my muscles couldn't move. My arms fell limply as she walked away to the middle below the portal. Our eyes are still not breaking our gaze. With one last warm smile that broke my heart, she said her last words. "Goodbye, Phil."

Suddenly, 8 bright feathered wings opened behind her back, with sparkling light that looked like tiny bits of souls of faith. Before I could tell her to stay, she flew into the portal at an incredible speed. I rushed to see the portal was being sealed by bright strings of light. Through that portal, there are so many fucking creatures coming towards the portal. They looked like eldritch gods from some world of monstrosity of suffering. Just as the portal was near at the point of closing, the creatures were screaming, their terrifying mouths stretched open in defiance of rage. Suddenly, a huge bright light exploded before my eyes, as if I'm first to see the sun explode. And then, everything went black; ending the vision.

\-

I woke up in confusion, not knowing what's going on. The strangest thing is that I'm somehow alive. But there's a difference to that now, because I felt like my whole body is so free and fresh. What I mean is that I felt like I've escaped from some restless prison. My mind was never this refreshing and clean. I stood up without difficulty and looked around my entire room to find myself alone. No monsters or anything else, other than myself.

I was filled with faith and purpose, knowing that I have a sister named Iris. There really is someone who treated me like a true human being. But, at that last flash of memory, I think she was some sort of angel. It sounds crazy, but after everything I've gone through, the entities, everything. And she also mentioned something else before she left. Who's coming? And what else does she know that I don't. I wished she had stayed with me, that I don't have to be here for this bullshit. I wished I could've told her not to marry this fucker.

I'm going to find her, no matter what it takes.

As I walked to the opened door, I nearly tripped off my footing. I looked down to see.....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My cold dead eyes. I'm dead this whole entire time.

Part 2
