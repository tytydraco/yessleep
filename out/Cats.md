In the imperial capital of Meowgasaki, where nobles strolled in silk pajamas and sushi rained from trees during festival season, the feline-based sword laws were as strict as they were ridiculous.



According to the Shogunate’s official Edict of Nyaa and Tuna, only true samurais were permitted to wield a two battle cats.



Which brings us to the rooftop of a pufferfish tavern, where Yuji Itadori, a rookie samurai-in-training with only one mildly cooperative cat named Whiskers, stood squinting at his mentor, Gojo Satoru, who was—very obviously—wielding two cats. One in each hand.



"Gojo-sensei," Yuji asked, blinking under the glare of the full moon and several irritated felines, "why are you wielding two cats? The shogunate says even high-level samurai can only carry one. And you’re not even technically a samurai. You're just a fraud who cooks insta ramen in a microwave because he's too lazy to do the dishes.



Gojo grinned, his blindfold fluttering in the wind like a dramatic curtain over someone who doesn’t pay taxes.



"Yuji, rules are just... suggestions with less hair on them," he said, striking a ridiculous pose. "Besides, these aren't just cats. They’re—"



The cat in his left hand interrupted with a growl: "Don't you dare finish that sentence, nyaa."



The one in his right hand added, "We are not props in your overcompensating power fantasy, you stupid furries, nyaa."



Before Gojo could offer some cryptic, self-aggrandizing response, Nobara Kugisaki walked onto the scene, the sound of her sandals slapping the ground echoing as she took in the truly outrageous sight. She was already exasperated by the state of the world, but what she saw now made her pause and blink in disbelief.



"Wait—hold on," Nobara said, her voice tinged with the disbelief only Gojo Satoru could inspire. "Did you... put hair gel on the cats, and why the fuck are they wearing a bikini?"



One of the cats angrily said: "That's not hair gel, nyaa."



Another cat said with desperation: "Please end us, nyaa."



Gojo, of course, looked unbothered. "Ah, Nobara! Glad you could join us. Yes, the cats are wearing bikinis and have been gelled for optimal battle performance. We’re not here to play by your boring human standards."



Nobara, hands on her hips, glanced from the cats to Gojo and back again, processing the sheer idiocy of the situation. “I—I just... Why are they wearing bikinis?” she asked, already knowing that the answer would be more ridiculous than she could fathom.



But Nobara, too curious for her own good, reached down, hesitated for a second, and then—without permission from any of the involved parties—lifted the bikini bottom.



Yuji’s eyes widened in sheer panic. “Nobara! What are you doing!? Why are you trying to unveil the secret kingdom!?”



But it was too late. Underneath the bikini, instead of a normal cat belly, was something even more ridiculous—a dental dam. A dental dam carefully tucked underneath the bikini, like some sort of fashion accessory.



Nobara stared at it, blinking in utter disbelief. "...What the actual hell?"



One of the cats angrily said: "It’s as bad as it looks, no joke, nyaa!"



Another cat said with desperation: "Please save us, nyaa."



Gojo, of course, looked unbothered. "That's just so that I don't catch any—".



Without warning, Nobara lunged forward, grabbed one of the cats by the scruff of its neck, and yanked it off the barrel. "You know what?" she said, her voice dripping with frustration. "I’ve had enough of this nonsense."



Yuji, who had been staring in utter horror, barely managed to croak out, "N-Nobara, what are you—?"



Before anyone could react, Nobara swung the cat like a weapon and, in a single, flawless motion, sliced Gojo Satoru clean in half.



The end.
