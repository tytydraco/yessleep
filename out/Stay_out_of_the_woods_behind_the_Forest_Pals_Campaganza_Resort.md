"This is still dumb," says George.  He holds up the stack of note-cards, squints at them through the flicker of the firelight.  "I mean, it's *real* dumb."

Our campfire has started to burn low in the gathering dark, and the embers swirl up and away in a sudden gust of autumn wind.  I shiver, and I pause the video I'm recording to pick up another log.

"It's okay, George." I flash him a smile.  "I mean, we just want the money, right?  We don't morally censure."  Carol starts to smile a bit at that, too, but Kayden presses his lips together and she stops.

"Sure," says Kayden.  "Sure.  I mean, *I* think it's a pretty unique - okay.  Anyway, it's a simple mission.  Pick your favorite joke card, read the joke, discuss.  Jules pans over to the creepy houses while our silvery laughter echoes through the endless dark... and *scene*.  Found money, baby."

George makes a face and shifts his bulk in the camp chair.  "Maybe."  He looks down the street to where the dead neighborhood crouches in the twilight : twelve ranch-style brick houses, all dark, all abandoned, some with collapsed roofs and rioting weeds boiling through empty windows.

No graffiti, though.  The local teens have been oddly restrained in that regard.

\---

We've been out here maybe an hour, in the deep woods behind the Forest Pals Campaganza Resort.  It's early October, and the resort is closed for the year, so there's no one to notice as we ride past the shuttered cabins in George's customized golf cart with the off-road wheels.  We leave the camp behind and plunge into the darkening woods, and after a dim and very bumpy thirty minutes, the trail opens out and we find ourselves in the cul-de-sac.

The rugged dirt track gives way to cracked asphalt, and George brings the cart to a halt and shuts the engine off.  He's listening - for what, I don't know - and I'm grateful that Kayden has the grace not to interrupt, at least for now.  I use the time to get the camera fired up and shoot some footage of our surroundings.

We're parked at the end of a fair-sized street, long enough to accommodate the five crumbling brick houses on each side and two at the end, plus the weed-choked empty fields that butt up against the woods and flank the golf cart on both sides.  Beyond, the dark trees loom thick and tall in all directions.  It's as if someone airdropped a bulldozer and some construction materials into the trackless wilderness, built this place, and then left it all to rot.

On our left, a bent and rusted metal pole topped with a faded green rectangle rises out of a pricker bush.  It's a street sign, clearly, and I zoom in closer to try to read the lettering, but it's too faded and the light of the setting sun too dim.

Carol, true to form, takes notice of my plight and plays her pocket flashlight over the sign's surface.  It's still a tough read, but with her help I can barely make out the ghosts of the letters:

***BEASTS O' FIELD*** *CT*

That doesn't seem like an actual name, and I begin to wonder in earnest who built this place and why.  I turn the camera away, Carol clicks her flashlight off, and a moment later George restarts the engine and drives us right down the street to the circle at the end.

There are a couple of dilapidated street lamps dotted around here, none of which actually work, and a long low car with the world's most 1970s brown-on-gold paint job has crashed into one of them - a long time ago, to judge from the creeping vines wrapped around the hood ornament.  George pulls the golf cart alongside and glares through the remains of the windshield.

Kayden grins big from the shotgun seat and lets out a whoop.  "This.  Is.  *AWESOME*!  George, buddy, I take back everything I said.  You got us here in style."

He claps George on the shoulder and lets out a woo-hoo that echoes back from the empty houses and the woods beyond.  "O-*kay*.  Let's do this up.  Babe, you get the chairs set up and start the fire going.  Get your brother to help you, he likes carrying things.  Jules, grab that camera and follow me.  The lady wants footage, we'll give her - "

"Hold up," says George, and climbs out of the driver's seat.  He walks over to the dead sedan, opens the passenger door, fumbles around inside.  For a moment he falls still, and all I can see are his legs around the side of the open door.  The wind picks up and whistles through a dozen crumbling chimneys, and suddenly I don't want to be here anymore.  Suddenly this all seems very unwise, and George needs to get out of that car, and why isn't he moving, is something -

George backs out of the car, straightens up, and slams the door shut.  He tucks a book-shaped package under his coat and gets back in the driver's seat.  "Okay," he says, and swings the golf cart around in a tight circle.

"Hey!" yells Kayden.  "Where we going?  I said we need to - "

"Camp," says George, and keeps the pedal floored until we're back at the far end of the street where the trail opens out.  "We'll set up here.  If you still want to do this."

And so we do.

\---

Now the fire is lit, and the dark is almost here.  Kayden grabs the log off my lap and tosses it into the flames, sending up a shower of sparks and getting a small scream out of Carol.  Far away and deep in the woods, something big rustles and falls silent.

Kayden claps his hands together, favors George with his best leading-man grin.  "Well, anyway.  You're on, big guy.  We rolling, Jules?"

We aren't, but I get the camera going again and point it in George's direction.  He picks the first of the "joke cards" off the stack, holds it up with two fingers, and wrinkles his nose at it.  "Jokes, huh?"

Kayden clenches his fists in the air like he's milking a giant cow.  "George, buddy, sometimes I despair of you.  It's, like, *art* jokes, okay?  It's not gonna be someone slipping on a banana peel."  He makes a twirling gesture.  "Just keep rolling, Jules, we can cut this out.  Let's get through this, okay, big guy?  Do it for your sister."

George sighs.  "Okay, okay.  Here we go: *The Priest of the Sun was exultant.  'As this blackness falls,' he reasoned, 'can yellow be far behind?'*"  He glares at the card a moment longer, then shoves it onto the back of the stack and hands the lot to me.  "We get how much for this, again?"

"Five. Hundred. *Each*!"  Kayden savors each word like vintage port, then gives Carol's arm a playful punch.  "That's a whole lotta costumes, amirite?"

Kayden's whole thought is currently bent on funding the first-ever theatrical production of something called *Nodens : A Comedy*, which is written by Kayden and stars Carol and which I am definitely going to be forced to sit through at the end of the semester.

The thought of costumes finally gets a smile out of Carol.  "And a whole lot of sets," she says.  "Thanks so much for doing this, guys."

Kayden grins wider.  "How about it, George?  Gonna donate your take to the Arts?  Help us breathe faint life into these gossamer strands of fragile creation?"

George reaches down into his backpack, takes out a beer, and cracks it open.  "Nope."

Kayden's smile falters just a bit.  "Well - okay.  You did bring the wheels, so, um... okay.  Your turn, Jules."

It is indeed my turn.  I look around first.  Our little ring of light and warmth seems very small against the night.  Down the street, shadows leap and flicker across the sagging brick walls of the dead houses.   Six on each side and two at the end, like taxidermied soldiers standing guard over -

"There were only twelve," Carol says.

I stand up slowly and look harder.  Six on each side and two at the end, the front rooms of the nearest ones caved in like toothless jaws.  Leading up to each front door are cement steps covered in green astroturf that has gone faded and lumpy in the sun.

I gulp.  "We must have miscounted."

"Maybe," Carol says.  She bites her lip and turns toward the fire.  "I'm not sure I like this place."

"*Babe*."  Kayden's indignant now .  "Of *course* you don't like this place.  I mean, you heard her say why they shut it down, right?"

Carol nods.  "The soldiers that lived here, they went crazy - right?  Fought each other.  So the Army closed it all up."  She shivers.  "I don't think it's that.  It's - "  The fire crackles and pops.  "I don't know.  I just don't like it."

Kayden stands up and starts tossing logs in the fire - one, two, three, right after the other.  They smoke and blaze, and shadows dance across our faces as the wind blows harder.  It smells like rain and crackling leaves.

"I know," he says.  "I know, babe.  That's why we get paid the big bucks, though, right?  We're telling these jokes on the *very same street* where Major McClarty made his final stand.  We tell 'em outside Chuck E Cheese's instead, it lacks a certain cachet, you know?  People are gonna know that Major McClarty holed up beside *that* fence - "

"I dunno about that," says George.

Kayden rounds on him.  "Yeah?  Look, Georgie, I know you're not exactly a lifetime patron of the opera or anything, but you gotta see that if you take this place, this *legend*, and sprinkle in the dramatic tension of feckless teens yukking it up, it makes for - "

George drinks beer and sighs.  "What legend is that?  Major McClarty?  Never heard of him.  I - "

Kayden throws up his hands.  "The lady *told* us, George.  Jules, are you still rolling?  Make sure you keep this part for George in case he forgets again.  The lady explained this back at the inn when she offered us the job, right?  About Major McClarty and how this place has been hidden out here for years behind the camp because the Army - "

"I know what she *said*."  George crumples up his beer can and places it lovingly into his backpack.  "It didn't fit.  I've lived here all my life, and - "

Kayden nods gravely.  "That's what I love about you, George.  What we all love about you.  You're *constant*."

I give him a look.  "Keep it up, and we're going to have a problem."

Carol blinks at me.  Kayden puts up his palms.  "Okay, okay.  Geesh, I didn't know he was your beau or whatever.  All I'm saying - "

"All *I'm* saying is knock it off.  George, you tell it.  I wasn't there and I'd like to hear."

George nods.  "Thanks, Julie.  So, the story this lady told to sell us on the job.  Major McClarty?  A bunch of soldiers blowing up their own street?  I went to school three miles from here, and the kids, they'd have told that story five times every recess.  We'd have ridden our bikes out here on weekends and had cap gun fights.  But we didn't.  Know why?"

Kayden just looks.

"Cause it didn't happen," says George.  "I went to the library after and asked around.  The police station, too.  Nobody knew about it.  And they'd know."

Kayden rubs his hair.  "But the lady said - "

"I know she did," says George.  "I didn't like her."

I'm wearing my heaviest parka, and it's working less effectively than I might have hoped.  I lean closer to the fire.  "Maybe I should tell my joke."

Carol gives me an encouraging smile.  "Go for it, Julie.  Let's get this over with."

I set the camera where it can see my face and pick up the next card.  The neat words stare up at me, all loops and whorls and occasional flourishes.  I clear my throat.

"*Beneath the earth*," I read, "*there lurked a house with windows the color of spilled oil and bruises.  A man once walked into it, singing: 'Things go in and out of my head, things go in and out of my head...'*"

I pause.  "Is that it?" Carol asks.

"No," I say.  "Sorry.  It says to pause there.  Then it says: *He was more right than he knew*."

We all fall quiet a moment.  The flames crackle and the shadows leap.  "Is *that* it?" George asks.

"That's it."  I shrug.  "Honestly, I'm starting to feel like five hundred dollars is - "

Kayden snorts.  "Gesundheit," I say.

"No, no."  He giggles and waves his hands at me.  "It's just - that one wasn't too bad, I guess.  It's kinda - "  He looks over at the dead street, at the tall dark trees behind it, at the crashed car rusting beneath the darkened streetlight.  I notice for the first time that the garage of the house across from it is open, as if someone drove the car out of it and straight into the light pole.

Kayden gets up from his seat and does a little dance in front of the fire.  "Things go in and outa my head, things go in and outa my head," he sings.  "Like, if the guy was in *there* \- "  He waves a hand at the nearest house - "More right than he knew, amirite ladies?"  He winks at Carol.

She doesn't wink back.  "You're scaring me, Kayden," she says.

Kayden looks genuinely abashed.  "Geez, I'm sorry, babe.  I didn't mean to - man, it's getting late, I guess.  Let's *do* this.  Your turn, honey."  He sits down and tries his best to appear inoffensive, with partial success.

"How many of these do we have to do?" I ask him.  "To get the five hundred."

Kayden swallows.  "Just one.  One each.  I know there's more cards in the stack, but - that was so you could pick one you liked, maybe do a couple of takes with different ones to see what worked best, you know.  But we're just supposed to tell one each and discuss, and that's the job.  I got the feeling she was doing a bunch of these with different groups, and then she'd edit them all together for the final film."

"Two more, then.  I'm very much looking forward to meeting this employer of ours."  I hand Carol the cards.  "We can do this."

"We can do this," Carol agrees.  She looks over at George.  "Why - you said you didn't like her."

George nods.  "I didn't."  He looks into the fire.

We wait, some more patiently than others.  Eventually George looks up.  "Back at the inn," he says.  "You and Kayden were arranging with her about everything, and I went outside to wrench on Mr. Armbruster's truck.  And so out she comes, all smiles, and I ask her what she's going to call the movie.  Bunch of kids telling jokes in front of a haunted street, what do you call that?"

The fire pops and sparks, and three of us flinch.  George just makes a face.  "She says she's going to call it 'Campfire Jokes'.  And she smiles at me again."

He shakes his head.  "Didn't like the smile.  Didn't like her."

We all sit quietly then, and George extracts another beer from his backpack.  A coyote howls somewhere close, and I jump in my seat.

Kayden, who has been looking increasingly scandalized, finally speaks up.  "She's spending a minimum of two grand per scene on this thing," he says, "and she's going to call it '*Campfire Jokes*'?"

"Nope."  George takes a sip of his beer.  "Wouldn't think so."

Kayden looks at him, starts to say something, and then stops.  George takes out the book-shaped package he rescued from the dead sedan and starts to leaf through it.  "What's that?" Kayden asks.

"Owner's manual," says George.  "Got it out of the glovebox."  He holds it up to the light.  On the front, a shinier copy of the dead sedan dances in the firelight, ready for action.  *Chrysler Primadonna*, it reads.  *1974 Operator's Guide*.

"Ever heard of that make and model?"  George asks.

We all consider that.  "Noooo," I say at last, "but I'm not really much of a car buff, George.  Have you ever heard of it?"

"Nope," says George.  "Also, the front page says it's published by the Chrysler-American Motors Corporation in Saurkash, Wisconsin.  That's wrong, too."

We all consider *that*.  The wind rustles in the trees and bends the heads of the tall weeds in the derelict gardens.  Kayden rubs his chin.  "What - um.  What exactly are you suggesting, George?"

George shrugs.  "Not sure.  But I do suggest we all tell our jokes and go home."

Kayden grins.  "You never spoke a truer word.  Darling?  Your line, I believe."

Carol straightens her back, and I can see her thinking of the praise which the theatre critic of the *North Woodsman* will lavish on the sumptuous sets and gracious costumes of *Nodens : A Comedy*.  She draws a breath and looks at the next card.

"*For a thousand years he drove,*" she reads, "*and for a thousand more it rained.  The rain came down, and the world rolled on.*"

"Beer, anyone?" says George.

"Sorry, that wasn't the end," says Carol.  "It's another one of those pausing ones.  The end is *And it turned into a puddle.*"

"*HA*!" roars Kayden.

"Nuts," says George.

I start to giggle and turn it into a cough.  "Okay," I say, "I guess I *sort* of get that - it's a bit dark, not really my - "  I giggle again.  "Man, it is *late*.  It's just that the world - "

"The *WORLD* was the puddle!" Kayden shouts.  "*BWAAAAA HA HA HA HA*!  I *knew* there was something about you, Jules, I *knew* there was a reason Carol liked you, I - I - "  He collapses back into his camp chair, gasping for breath.

The moon is rising over the trees : a great orange harvest moon, large and close and pocked with craters.  It lights the dead houses with a cheerless light the color of moldy cheese, throws Kayden's laughing face into bilious relief.  Carol shrinks back into her seat, looks at Kayden with wide frightened eyes.  I get up, wanting to comfort her, to shake Kayden out of it -

The *world* was the *puddle*!  You'd have expected a bit more after a thousand years of driving, right?  Only goes to show!

I'm on my knees beside the fire, laughing, whooping, pounding my fists in the dirt.  Carol's lips are trembling.  I think: if I could just explain it to her, make her see there's really nothing to be scared of, that one just happened to hit Kayden and me just right -

George's arms are around me, picking me up off the ground, pressing a beer into my hand.  "Drink this," he says.  "You're okay.  You're okay, Julie.  It's time to go."  He guides me over to the golf cart, puts me in the shotgun seat, goes back for his sister.  Carol is weeping openly now; George sits her down next to me and I hug her.

Kayden has found the cards and now he's shuffling through them, still laughing.  The moon wheels overhead, and as it rises over the trees I can see that there are fifteen houses now : six on each side and three at the end.  George sweeps the camp chairs and the backpack into his arms and starts lugging them over to the golf cart; he's too busy to notice Kayden stopping at one particular card and beaming at it with tears in his eyes.

"Kayden!" I scream.  "No!  No more jokes!  George is right, we need to - "

The smile is dying on Kayden's face, and when he looks at me he doesn't see me.  "Oh," he says, in a very small voice.  "Oh, no."

George hurls the equipment into the cargo rack and starts tying it down, hands flying like quicksilver in the poisoned moonlight.

Kayden's tear-streaked face has gone hard and still.  "One more, fam," he says.  "One more for the win."

I shake my head as hard as I can.  "We don't need it!"  The wind whips up and I scream louder.  "We'll get the money some other way!  I'll help!  Just - "

Kayden is shaking his head.  Tears run down his face as he shakes the joke cards at us with both hands.  "You’re not tracking!" he yells over the wind.  "I picked the rug, Jules – the Dude’s rug!  What are the chances?"  His head whips back and forth, trying to take in us and the houses at the same time.  "Oh, *man*!  She got us good, gang!"  He lets out a shrill, ululating giggle, like a clown gone mad with fear.  "Major McClarty?  Soldiers?  *That’s* the best joke of all!"

He giggles again.  One of his eyes is wider than the other.  "Beasts O' Field Court," he says. "More right than he knew." He turns away from us toward the cul-de-sac.

"Time to go, buddy," says George.  He grabs Kayden by the arm.

"*NO*!" shrieks Kayden.  He shoves George into the fire ring and takes off for the houses.

Carol and I are both screaming, I think.  We pile out of the golf cart and run for George, but he's  already out of the ring and rolling around on the ground.  We help him up.  "I'm fine," he grunts.  "That crazy idiot - get in the cart!"

We do.  I grab the camera on the way, and George floors the pedal the second our butts hit the seat.  The cart rockets forward, silent and powerful, with Kayden a dark distant figure in the halogen beams.

He makes it to the circle and climbs up onto the roof of the dead sedan.  We are racing past the houses now; empty doors gape at us like missing teeth.

Kayden spins to face us.  He pounds his chest and throws out an arm.  He speaks - I see his lips moving - but the wind takes the words and whips them away.  He's laughing, crying, a one-man sock-and-buskin atop the dead Chrysler Primadonna as the cart bumps and jounces toward him and I hold onto Carol for dear life.

Kayden finishes his joke - or at least he stops speaking - and he turns away from us, toward the fifteenth house that crouches at the end of the cul-de-sac.

The light above its front door blinks on.

It is a dark, greasy light, yellow-orange like the moon, that does not warm and does not chase the shadows away.  The dark seems to welcome it, to reach toward it with eager tendrils, and Kayden leaps down from the sedan's roof and walks stiff-legged up the astroturf steps.  Joke cards fall from his limp fingers and flutter away in the breeze.

George slams on the brake.  The cart screeches to a stop.  Fat raindrops begin to pelt the roof : first one, then many.  Leaves rattle through the empty yards and tumble across the street.

Kayden stands in front of the door now, bathed in that sickly glow, and as we watch the front door swings open.

Inside is a darkness so vast and deep that it is scarcely dark at all.  True, the open doorway is a perfect void, flat and dead : but behind it, what clutter!  There stand the bone-white corpses of the great machines, yellowed to perfection such that to see and to touch them is to yellow as well; there, the bed with its sheet of dust, pulsing grey-orange in its terrible hunger.  And beyond it all - just around the corner - a short, dark shape, bruised in countless squirming colors -

Kayden steps across the threshold, his arms limp at his sides.  The door snaps shut in perfect silence.  And the light on the porch blinks out.

George shifts the cart into reverse.  We back away from that place, and only when we have passed out of the dead street and back into the trail beneath the trees does he stop long enough to turn us around.  He drives us home, through the dark and the rain, while Carol screams Kayden's name and I hold her and cry.

\---

There's not much more to tell.

George drives us straight to the police station and tells them Kayden went missing during our camping trip.  They send out a search party, and when the search party doesn't find anything they send out a helicopter.  George and I go along to show them where we'd been.  There are no houses in the woods, there or anywhere else.

Carol gets better, slowly.  George and I spend a lot of time with her that fall and winter, to help her forget and to show her we care.  She's back at school now and doing all right.

On a blustery evening in February, George and I have just finished up a delightful dinner date at the finest steakhouse in Manchester.  He's gone to get the car, and I'm waiting outside under the awning watching the snow.  "Pardon me, miss," a contralto voice says, and I turn to find myself tete-a-tete with a dark-haired adventuress type in stylish fur boots.

"Oh, sorry," I say, and I move aside to let her past.

She laughs a musical laugh.  "*I'm* sorry," she says.  "I didn't mean 'Pardon me, miss', I meant 'Pardon me, miss'.  I'm not going in there; can't stand the place.  But I do have something that's yours."  She pushes an envelope into my hand.  "Two thousand dollars.  And well-earned.  The ending was *incredible*."

I sputter a bit.  "I - you - who - I never sent you - "

She waves it away.  "No, no, I get that.  But at this point I think we both know I never wanted it anyway."  Her cheeks dimples as she smiles.  "'Campfire Jokes', amirite?"

The steakhouse door swings open and a very grim-looking maitre'd pokes his head out.  "Madam?  Would you care to come back inside while you wait?  There is a bitter wind blowing this evening; I should hate for you to be caught out in it."  He looks me straight in the eye as he speaks.

The adventuress turns the dimples on him.  "All right, Reginald, I'm leaving.  No need to get all in a twist about it; she's quite safe."  She pats me on the shoulder.  "That George really is a cutie; I'm happy for you.  And seriously, enjoy the money.  Maybe stay out of the woods for awhile, though.  Take your next vacation at a spa, or something.  Luck!"  She turns and is gone into the snow.

George pulls up in his pickup then, and when we're warm and on the way home I tell him what happened.  I wouldn't have guessed that he knew all those words.

Carol's back at school, remember?  That includes her theatre class.  Once she was through the worst of it, she decided that Kayden's great vision deserved to live.  I'm not sure I totally agree, but George and I still put a bit of our money into the pot to make sure that *Nodens : A Comedy* could live its best life.  We're in our seats now, waiting for the curtain to go up.

Wish us lots and lots of luck.
