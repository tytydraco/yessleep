Railway 3578-PZ49, a railroad that used to travel in and out of the friton. It was used for getting people out, bringing resources in, etc. But that was almost 35 years ago, anyone still there surely would have assimilated by now. I wish I knew all of this before I went in there, I wish I was dead, but it’s far too late for that.
My right to die was taken long ago.

The sign was scratched, decayed, and graffitied, now reading RunAway 3##8-PZ##. “huh…PZ” I thought to myself, I’ll call it that from now on ; makes it easier to say anyways. Looking down the railway it was a large tunnel, blue and pink tinted vines coming out from inside ; wrapping around the walls and ceiling protruding as if they were alive and wanting more. I could hear the snow crunch below my feet, the cracking of the snow sounding as if I was crushing bones under my hazmat suit.

I entered the railway tunnel with nothing but my suit and a flashlight. Without the outside light, the inside of PZ was almost pitch black ; turning on my flashlight I could see the vines everywhere, they completely covered the walls, floor, and ceiling. Cars were abandoned, an oil tanker was flipped on its side, not only that but the vines in here were an even deeper blue, looking like the bottom of an Iceberg.

Shining my light to one of the cars I could see a corpse, the half face of a forgotten man, the skin that remained frozen over almost as blue as the vines. He had no eyes but his gaze was as piercing as the cold winds hit my suit.

I continued onward

The more I looked around the more I realized I wasn’t alone in PZ. Corpses lay along the ground and walls ; some more decayed than others, some looking as if they just died yesterday. The closer I looked the more I wanted to look away, not only was death all around me but something beyond my understanding was going on. All the bodies had those…vines going into them, surrounding their body and encasing them in the vines' own texture.

I continued onward


I guess I never said why I was here in the first place, I’m trying to find something that was left behind by one of the past residents….believe it was a teddy bear. It’s what I do, I go into places and retrieve lost things for a price. It’s not much but it’s relatively easy and I can ask pretty much any price I want ; can’t put a price on memories.

I reached the oil tanker, it was basically at the very end of PZ, I could even see the sun. Taking a glance in the driver's seat I saw the teddy bear next to the pedal. I crawled in reaching for the teddy bear, I got it. 

Another easy job.
 Just a little more strange than the rest.

Before I could crawl out something was moving through the snow, I tried to hurry out but hit my arm on the interior of the car. The noise darted in my direction, before I even had time to react it wrapped around my ankle and started pulling me out PZ. During the frenzy I was able to see it was one of the vines pulling me. The whole time I felt a sharp pain in my thigh, I had a giant shard of glass from the tankers window in my skin, puncturing my suit. I had no choice but to try and cut the vine, I was being pulled rapidly into the edge of the woods at this point, vines surrounding every surface I could see. Pulling out the shard showed me more of my own blood than I’ve ever seen in my life. I went to cut the vine, as I sliced, the glass broke.
My vision faded.

I continued onward

When I came to my senses, I sensed everything, senses I’ve never felt before. I could see as if I had a million eyes, each blinking in their own pattern, not only that, I could feel, GOD COULD I FEEL. It’s like I had billions of veins connecting and overlapping, stretching across hundreds of miles. The strangest thing is that I wasn’t warm like I should be but I wasn’t cold like I should be. My skin felt as though I was made of pure frost and meat. I couldn’t help but freak out, I tried to get up and run away, thrash ; kick ; hit ; when I did so, all I could hear were dozens of trees being taken down all around “me”. I couldn’t tell if the trees were my doing, but I didn’t have time to think about it.
I passed out shortly after.


I stood still for 35 years

I stood still for 647 years

“I” am no longer alone…through time I’ve learned it is “we”. The corpses that we saw all those centuries ago were us. We didn’t know it yet but we were meant for greater things. Our body isn’t for one but is for all, every eye ; every “vine” ; every corpse ; they are all one of us, but we are them, and we are one.

We grow
