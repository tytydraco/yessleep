 I came to while lying on a small boat floating on a vast lake. Around me, there was nothing but dark, still, silent water. And above me, a vast sky speckled with stars.

Behind me, on the boat, was a woman rowing the boat with two paddles. While I couldn’t turn much, that was the best I could see. 

Having no recollection of how I got here, I asked, “Why am I here? Let me get off!”

“Oh really, dear?” the woman responded. “And if I do, where will you get off?”

I conceded as she continued rowing the boat. She was right, for I was surrounded by water, and had to go where she was bringing me.

For a while, we floated on the water in silence instead of making any conversation. Eventually, a small familiar-looking island poking out of the expansive body of water came to be seen in the distance. It was green, carpeted in ferns and mosses, with the odd tree poking out. As we got closer, I noticed that there was a small wood cottage sitting on the island as well.

“This is your first stop. Here, you will make amends with your past,”, the woman announced.

“What is this, a city train?”, I replied snarkily, before curiously asking, “Make amends with my past?”

“Indeed. In life, people like you have many shortfalls. Things left unfulfilled. Here, you address them and heal the soul before moving on.”

The boat bumped onto the mossy shore and stopped at the island. Looking up, I noticed the silhouette of two people. 

My mum and dad. I never expected to see them again, for they passed away when I was just a kid.

As every kid with their parents, I loved them as the world itself. To me my parents were my rock, my superheroes.

One day, they were cruelly wrested from me. From what I was told, they collided into a semi truck on the highway while driving home, and passed away on impact. Never making it back to me, who was waiting impatiently back at our house while playing on my xbox, blissfully unaware of what was happening.

After that, I never truly recovered. I functioned normally enough, of course, but in every moment of my life, every time I felt low, every time I made a crowning accomplishment, there was this niggling shortfall in the back of my mind that my parents weren’t around to see me grow. That they would never again reassure me, guide me, cheer loudly for me. Don’t get me wrong, my aunt and uncle who I lived with were decent, but we just didn’t have that emotional attachment.

I kept all this in the back of my mind as I approached them.

“...Mum? Dad?”, I asked, my voice cracking.

“Here you are, Darren! How have you been, dear?”, my mum asked. “Let’s go inside, you can tell me everything.”

Against my better instincts, I immediately sobbed and ran to my parents, tackling them with a bear hug. They crushed me with a hug as well, for the first time in what was probably fifteen years. We went into the small cottage, and I pondered upon the familiarity of the room.

With a start, I realised that it looked just like our old living room, back when we were one united, happy family. 

“Now, let’s chat. How were you, buddy?”, my dad asked.

This time, I didn’t hold back. I spilled everything that happened in my life since they left. Every little activity, emotion, success, failure, major event, I never held back. I must have prattled on about everything for a solid half-hour, but they listened to me just as I had always dreamed. I grew up with the notion that I had no one to talk about my life, but now, I had that chance, and I was unwilling to let it go. To top it all off, I admitted what had been in my mind the entire time.

“If you don’t mind… I have an admission to make.”

“What is it?” my mum asked, concern palpable in her voice.

“Tell us whatever it is. We won’t judge you, I promise!”, my dad added.

“All the time…”, I faltered, “For years…. I wanted you around. I always regretted that you would never be around, that there was no one like you for me. I cursed fate for dealing me this life. I always wished things would be like before you died…”

“That is a past you cannot return to,” my dad advised. “Don’t dwell on it too much.”

“Oh sweetie,” my mum said, “We were always with you. In your every waking moment, in every step you took, with your every breath, we were always with you. We never truly left you.”

The realisation hit me like a bucket of cold water. That I was meeting them, proved that they would never truly leave me. I had never been truly alone, had never been left adrift in the world like I previously thought. 

“Now, you must let go. Be made anew.”

“No, I don’t want to go!”, I protested. “Just a minute! Or five minutes! I would spend eternity with you!”

“You cannot,” my mother explained. “Now come, she awaits.”

I did not ask who ‘she’ was, assuming it was the lady rowing the boat. As much as I dreaded it, I let my parents walk me out of the cabin and back down the slope to the mossy shore. As I stood there, my mum walked around me and stood to my front.

“And remember,” she said, “No matter what, we love you. Always. Never forget that, wherever you go.”

“Always.”, my dad agreed.

“It is time,” said a resounding feminine voice next to me. The boat lady. “You must accept this encounter as a final chance at communication, as a breath of fresh air, and nothing more. What awaits you yet is salvation.”

With a heavy heart, I stepped back onto the small boat. I had no wish to separate from my parents again, and I still had so much more to tell them. Yet, they and the boat lady had impressed upon me that it was time to leave, to move on. So, I waved at my parents as I left them for what felt like the last time.

As we moved away from the first island back into the still, open water, I reflected that here, I had to let go. Not worry about stolen moments, and instead enjoy the time I had with my loved ones.

Lost in thought, I didn’t notice the next island we approached until we nearly reached the island.

“And this is your next stop. Another one you loved in life.”, the lady announced. I immediately had an idea of who it might be, and it was solidified as soon as I saw her. The love of my short life. She looked the exact same way she did the last time I saw her, beautiful as ever. 

I first saw her when I started high school. At first, I only saw her in glimpses, when down the hallways or sitting in class. Eventually, I got to know her. Chatted with her, spent hours with her. She was genuinely the kindest, most friendly person I’ve ever met.

When she smiled, it was like the sun itself had come down to bedazzle me. Her so much as speaking to me released a tidal wave of euphoria in me. A single moment with her completely vanquished any feelings of despair I ever had. For years, I struggled with my feelings for her and my sense of inadequacy, the feeling that I would always be inferior to someone of her disposition. I, after all, was a random loner while she was successful and semi-popular.

But by the time our senior year came to a close, what I thought impossible happened. She admitted her feelings for me, and I admitted my feelings for her. And I thought that our relationship was finally unbreakable, built with the toughness and glamour of diamonds.

One day, she left me.

It was our graduation day, actually. Throughout the ceremony, I searched for her in every glance of the area, but she was nowhere to be seen. Alarm bells already began to ring in my head, as that was most unlike her, but I didn’t expect what I found next. As soon as I could, I jumped in my car and left in search of her. I pulled over in her driveway, got off and rapped on the door twice.

No response.

My heart hammering furiously in my chest, I knocked a few more times. “Sarah? Sarah! Open the door if you’re in here!”, I yelled. Without a response, I instead snuck in through the back door.

And there she lay, on the couch. With her wrists slit, blood flowing like a river all over the couch and pristine white floor tile. 

After that scene, I remember nothing of the time, but that something crucial, something precious was taken away from me. And without me knowing anything of her inner struggles, the multiple battles with her mind she outlined in her final message to me. And that loss was what sucked the life out of me. No amount of wandering, alcohol or parties could reverse me from essentially becoming a breathing corpse. My heart had been cut out, replaced with nothing but emptiness.

“...Sarah? Is that really you?”, I asked, getting off onto the sand and stepping towards her.

“It’s me, Darren. We’re meeting again.”, she responded in her saccharine voice.

“Oh my god! I’m so sorry I never knew what you were going through —”, I blurted out.

“Don’t worry,” she cut me off. “I never held it against you. It’s not your fault. None of this is your fault.”

“But we could have had so much time together. Why? Why did you do it?”

“I couldn’t find another way to deal with everything,” she said, voice quavering. “I was being blackmailed. I had no choice in it.”

“What?”, I asked, devastated.

“What you were told was only half the story. Once, I went to a party. And lets say… I was set up to make a few bad decisions. All sorts of compromising photos were taken. Half-nude photos of me, photos of me taking heavy drugs. Things that would embarrass me, send me to jail. I was threatened with the release of the photos.”

“What did they want?” I asked, concern visible in my voice.

As she shook her head slightly, I repeated, “Sarah? What did they want?”

“They wanted me to sleep with them. I couldn’t do it, and I didn’t know another way. I didn’t want to place that burden on you, so I didn’t tell you”, she solemnly explained, tears running down her face. 

“I could have helped….”, I said, still shellshocked at this revelation. This was what took my love from me?

Wiping her tears, she grabbed my shoulders. “Believe me, I regret that choice every moment I spend here. Most of all, it was seeing the look of shock on your face. The despair. The agony.”

“But, we spent time together in life. And I enjoyed every second of it. In the end, that’s all that matters.”, she reassured me.

“You’re right,” I said, realisation dawning upon me. I had always lamented the time we couldn’t spend together, but ended up overlooking our shared experiences. I was fortunate to have her by my side, even if for a short time.

“Then, and now, you need to let go. Stop despairing over the past. Leave your regrets in the past, and move on.”

“Everyone here keeps telling me that!”, I said, barking out a laugh.

“It’s true, and it helps. Remember the last time we spoke?”, she asked.

I did. We facetimed until the wee hours of the night, talking about random things and our plans for the future. We were to go to university, get a job, get married and all that. Oh, and a promise I made.

“One day, we’ll go out together. And take a long, romantic stroll on a nice beach somewhere.” I promised.

Her only response was “That’s nice, dear”.

“I’ll never forget those moments,” I responded. 

“You see?”, she explained. Smiling sweetly, she continued, “We’re walking on a beach now. A nice romantic stroll. Together.”

“All of this, here, it’s to leave no regrets in your life. So that at your eventual end, you never ponder the what-ifs.”

I couldn’t help but kiss her soft forehead in reply. “You’re right. I’ve let go, now.”, I said. This time, I understood that a few moments with her was enough.

“See you later, babe!”, I called out as I walked towards the boat waiting for me on the shore, bare feet crunching on the sand. As the boat gently moved further and further away from the sandy shore, I only had eyes for my lady love, who stood on the beach and waved at me as I rapidly departed.

“That was your final stop,” the lady announced. At that point, though, I remembered what brought me here.

I remembered driving through a vast pine forest, late at night.

I remembered swerving sharply to the right, trying to avoid another car rapidly bearing down on me.

I remembered the sound of metal crumbling like paper, the sound of glass shattering into smithereens, and being rolled around in the car like a shirt in a washing machine.

And then, silence.

My flashback was disturbed by the boat veering sharply to the right and speeding up, away from a vast shore filled with countless indistinguishable black body-like figures milling about.

“Where am I even?” I wondered aloud.

“You were dead, dear. The shore on the right is the land of the dead, the departed. Those who have lived out their lives in full. The shore on the left is the land to the living. Where you live another day. For you, to live all your days in full.”

As the boat slammed into the rocky shore, I shuddered to life on a paramedic’s stretcher.
