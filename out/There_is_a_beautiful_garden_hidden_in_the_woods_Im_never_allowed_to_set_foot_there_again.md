I come from a small town in the US, I'd rather not say where. We've got one of those big ass national forests not too far off, though, and that's really the main appeal of living here. Ain't got shit in town to do, and I'm not the sort for crowds, anyways. Wandering in the woods though, going for hikes and exploring... it's dangerous, but nothing makes me quite as happy. It's a shame I won't be coming within a mile of them woods ever again.  


A couple weeks back, things were different. I'd go for a hike at least a dozen times a month - I only work a couple days a week, so I have a lot of free time to myself. I'm a programmer - might be a bit of an odd choice for a nature junkie, but I can do my whole workload in a couple of afternoons, and as long as I tell my boss it took me the whole week, I get a full week's pay, and that gives me plenty of free time for what really matters to me. I was in the woods again, following an old trail I've been down more than a few times, when I noticed something I've never seen before... a branching path, off to my right. I wondered why I'd never noticed it, but didn't think too much about it - it was a new adventure, and that's all that mattered.  


The trail led for at least a couple miles, maybe more - I was walking for nearly two hours before I reached it. And by "it", I mean the most beautiful garden you've ever seen - a clearing in the forest with an absolute sea of strange, vibrant flowers. I walked carefully, so as not to crush anything, as I stepped through this Eden that I had stumbled upon. The flowers were huge, each petal the size of an oak leaf, and they varied in shade, from deep-sea blue to crimson, and dark purple as well. I was sure somebody must have put them here, must be tending to them - I waited for a while, hoping that I might be able to meet the one that had created such a magnificent place. But alas, nobody came, and the sun began to set. I knew better than to stay in the woods at night, so I packed up and left. For a moment I pondered taking a flower with me, but that felt wrong - these weren't my flowers, this wasn't my garden. I didn't have the right to just take one. And so I left, for the day.  


Of course, I knew I would return. I needed to know who was responsible, who'd created this masterpiece - and I did return, no less than 4 times over the course of the week. Every time I'd go down the same path, arrive in the same garden, and savor the serene beauty of the place. There was nowhere like it, I was certain, in the entire world. But no matter how many times I came, or how long I stayed, I never did catch a glimpse of the one who tends the garden. That bothered me to no end... and unfortunately, it made me lose my grip on common sense. I became sure that whoever was responsible must be coming around at night, and that if I wanted to meet them, I would need to do the same. The danger of wandering the forest at night no longer mattered to me - bears and wolves be damned, I would take that risk. Obsession makes a man do foolish things.  


And so, it was sunset when I first set upon the trail. I'd slept all afternoon, and so I wasn't particularly tired as I walked - although my foolishness had become a little more apparent. Sunset gave way to dusk gave way to night, and in the darkness, surrounded by towering trees, with only starlight to illuminate the path before me, I am not ashamed to admit I was nervous. Afraid, even. But I never considered turning back - it was out of the question. I needed to know, you see. And so, when I reached that fork in the path, despite every instinct telling me that I should not be here, I didn't hesitate. Nearer I was to the garden, and I was sure that tonight, tonight I would find them. The architect behind it, the artist who had painted for me a tapestry of Gaia's beauty.   


The garden looked different, under the light of the stars and the crescent moon, but it was no less beautiful. Normally I would have, as always, walked amongst the flowers, and taken in their majesty more thoroughly - but I caught a glimpse of movement, and found myself hiding behind a large tree. It could be a wild animal - a predator, I reasoned, as I hid. But what I saw that night was nothing so sane or ordinary, for he had finally shown himself. The Keeper of the Garden had arrived, and I knew I should never have come here.  


He - it - was a thing, to be sure. Not a man nor beast, but a THING, as hideous as the garder was beautiful. It wore a long, tattered red skirt, so I never got a glimpse at its legs, and I suppose that's for the best. Its arms were thin, little more than pale skin stretched over bone, and while it seemed to have ordinary proportions in regards its upper arms, the forearms of the creature were at least twice as long as those of a man, and one dragged along the ground as it walked. The other carried a sack... I'll get to that part soon. It had a thin, emaciated body, and no face - but from the top of its head all the way down to its naval, and possibly below the skirt as well, there was a clustering, uneven line of deep black holes. It had no eyes, no ears, no mouth, no hair - and as I watched, it opened the sack it carried, and began to feed the flowers.  


Inside the sack, it had carried the corpse of a young woman, bruised and stripped naked. It wrapped those long, thin fingers of one hand around the waist of the dead woman, lifting her up - and with the other it seized and twisted off her head, with a sickening crunch. Then, it held the head over the flowers, and stepped through the garden, pouring her crimson essence upon each and every one. When the head was mostly drained, it gently shoved it back into the bag, and lifted the body, tipping it upside-down and continuing the process. My mind had gone blank with fear, I was paralysed... and then, behind me, I heard a high pitched, warbling whistle.  


I turned around, but saw nothing. As I looked back, however, the Keeper had disappeared. The paralysis had been broken, but the fear remained, and I bolted down the trail. I made no effort to remain quiet - I was sure that thing had seen me, and I had no intention of letting it catch me. No desire to see that horrible emaciated body up close, or to know what might hide in those dark holes along its body. I ran, and even as my stamina started to give way, I refused to stop, coughing and panting as I persisted. And then, suddenly, I was out of the woods. The path should have been several times longer than it was, thinking back, but at the time I was just happy to have escaped. And then, again, I heard that whistle, and turned around.  


It came from a boy, or something that mimicked a young child. It wore a skirt, not unlike that of the Keeper, and was similarly pale. While thin, scrawny even, it did have a bulging pot belly. It had neither nipples nor a bellybutton, no hair to speak of, but it was the face of this boy-thing that made me shudder. Blind, white eyes, an overly large nose with skin stretched across the nostrils. And no lips - just exposed gums and teeth, forever forming a ghastly, predatory grin. It closed its mouth and the whistling stopped - and to my horror, a second mouth formed along the boy-thing's pot belly, and spoke in an impossibly deep voice. "You had best not return to the Garden again. It was never meant for you." I couldn't breathe, couldn't speak - and so I found my second wind, and ran further still, into town, as far from the woods as I could get, before I collapsed from exhaustion.  


I woke up in the drunk tank. Those cold steel bars had never been so comforting. When I got out, I returned to my apartment, and started to pack my things. I work online, as you know - so I have the freedom to move wherever I please. I'll go to the big city, start over - my plane leaves tonight. Because sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still see the Keeper and the Boy-Thing. They're waiting for me, in the Garden. Waiting for the day that I'm willing to trade my life for one last glimpse of perfection.
