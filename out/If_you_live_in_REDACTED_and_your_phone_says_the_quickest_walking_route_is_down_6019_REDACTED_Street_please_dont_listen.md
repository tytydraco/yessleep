It was a Friday night and I was exhaustedly making my home after an awful week at work. I live in a huge city, one of the largest in the country, and the streets were packed with young people who seemed to have all the energy I had long lost. I excuse-me-please'd my way through far too many of them, and eventually pulled up the Maps application to figure out a shortcut that would rid me of the never-ending crowding I was all too tired for.





Walk down \[REDACTED\] Street for 5 minutes, then turn onto 6019 \[REDACTED\] Street before walking for 10 minutes and arriving at your destination. 





I had never heard of a street with that name, nor did I think there were any streets with numbers before them rather than names. It showed up as the only street in the world with that number before its name, but I figured that was because of the unique number despite feeling somewhat weirded out. Still, though, it would supposedly save me a good deal of time and I trusted my phone enough. 



I walked along the first street for the 5 minutes I was told to and it was just your typical city street - lined with stores, lights and hordes of people. At the end of it, to my left, there was a similar street and to my right, there was a barely lit, empty counterpart. I should've stopped there, considering dark and sketchy places at night freaked me out, but the time I would save from taking that route kept me going. Enough time for an extra episode of some shitty sitcom. Or for aimlessly scrolling through social media and promptly falling asleep. Either way, a high enough upside after a tiring week. 



The whispering began as soon as I was past the first of very few old, yellowing lights. 





*"don't look, no looking, no looooking".*





I didn't even know what I wasn't supposed to look at, but I took no chances. I had the familiar feeling of being watched, of somebody, something, maintaining a constant focus on me. My eyes were fixed on the decaying concrete beneath my quickly shuffling feet.





The melodic murmur repeated itself over and over. Incessant. Demanding. 







*Irresistible.*





I had to find out what I was forbidden from looking at. As if it were some primal urge, some inevitable desire. 





So I did.





The walls were plastered with faces. Impossibly human-like faces. Stretching out along every inch of the old brick. Staring at me with long-lifeless eyes. Eyes that should have fallen dormant. Yet, they moved. Each step I took was met with dozens and dozens of eyes refocusing their gaze upon me. Making sure they didn't miss a thing. I wanted so desperately to curl into the smallest possible form on the cold ground and forever sleep, but I knew they would never stop watching. The voice finally stopped whispering, and I was met with an impossibly deep silence.





I missed the voice. Wished for it to return, to drown out the ever-imposing silence. But it never did. I have a feeling it did all it could to help me. 





Truth is, I never found a way out of that street. I tried in every way imaginable, and some of them will never leave me. The realisation set in after my latest attempt. I finally tried to go over, to scale the horrifying wall keeping me prisoner. I used the mouths of the faces as pegs for my hands and feet to climb with and yet the eyes followed me still. Looked up at me instead of down. The wall stretched impossibly long upwards as it did horizontally. At every turn, I was met with more faces. Lifeless, emotionless, blank canvases. And still, they stared. 





They stare in every waking moment, and they stare in every dream and nightmare. My existence has become a twisted amalgamation of those fucking faces. They sit there, devoid of any humanity - any emotion - beyond appearance, and yet I can feel them laughing at me. Taunting me.





I don't know how long I have been trapped here, and I don't know how to get out. I no longer believe I can, nor will I. My phone is about to die, and I needed people to know. To not fall victim to the faces like I did.





They will *never* let you go.





Please, stay far away from 6019 \[REDACTED\] Street.
