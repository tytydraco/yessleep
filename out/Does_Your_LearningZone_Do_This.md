PART I

Beneath the grand glass atrium of the former Eastbrook Mall, slippery tile floors gleamed under neon signs that flickered "Cola‑Co Classroom" and "Tech‑tots Academy" in bright bursts. The inconsistent lapping of air‑conditioned chill stabbed at my neck, ripping away the nostalgic warmth I had felt moments earlier. The Eastbrook Mall was no longer recognizable; apart from the occasional urban explorer, the mall had sat empty for most of my life. I vaguely remember Dad taking me on the mall’s carousel as a kid; still almost able to taste the Cinnabon and Auntie Anne’s cutting through the perfume of the nearby Hollister. I remember the time I wandered off from my mother, accidentally creating new neural pathways in the back of Spencer’s and asking more questions than she could answer. Within three years, all of those stores were gone, leaving behind a neighborhood-sized sea of asphalt moating a crumbling beige castle. In that state, the mall stared lifelessly at the surrounding roads and highways; drivers averted their eyes as if ignoring roadkill.

That was until the unburied carcass that was Eastbrook Mall was wrapped in a cocoon of drapes and tents. The chrysalis emerged the next year, rebranded to become our county’s K–12 campus, one of the many “LearningZone” locations metamorphosing dead malls across America. The walkways were jammed with nearly every kid in the county; my nose turned up at the scent of stale pretzels and burnt popcorn wafting from converted storefronts. Students clustered around food stalls, clutching tablets and talking business in loud, hurried tones. I could tell immediately that I was out of my element; a fear I’d expressed to my parents months ago. They signed the fifty‑page Student Responsibility Pact without reading past the first paragraph. In exchange for the massive tax break, LearningZone assumed full custody of us from September through June. With most public schools now shuttered, and bridges burned with my old private school, they’d had no choice. I watched my mother struggle to hold back tears as she signed, though I figure those were more for her reputation than her son. Before the representative left our living room, he clipped a purple “9th Grader” badge to a lanyard and placed it around my neck with all the importance of a presidential medal ceremony. He also left a box containing a tablet locked to the LearningZone network, preloaded with exactly ten “FutureFunds,” the only currency accepted. No FutureFunds meant no lunch, no access to labs, no chance to step out of line.

I paced nervously down the corridor of pods, each a former boutique or electronics store now refitted into classrooms. Above one storefront, a sleek, techy font read: "Pod 7: TechMart Lab." Inside, kindergarteners tapped through smartphone UI tests for credits. In "Pod 23: CreditNow CredCademy," students jostled one another in a frenzy, sharing answers to algebra problems to funnel points onto their FutureFunds cards. Their teacher looked exhausted, offering me a weary grin as I passed. Neon sponsor logos pulsed above every entrance: "Energy Cola‑Co," "CreditNow Financial," "SnackVault." The mall felt alive like it had when I was little, but I didn’t recall the oppressive hum of fluorescent lights and the weight of hundreds of judging eyes. I swiped my badge to enter "Pod 12: FutureForce Learning Zone." The half‑asleep facilitator woke up just enough to acknowledge me.

"Take a seat," she wheezed. "Follow all instructions on the tablet. No talking."

A faded "Launch Web" sticker sat over the tablet’s original power button, worn from whoever had it before me. When pressed, it booted to a garish Netscape‑era screen that loaded at dial‑up speed. I nervously scanned my classmates as they tapped through their tablets, eyes glazed, earning funds for slushy vouchers and branded hoodies. When my tablet finally loaded, question one appeared:

*FutureForce’s slogan is: “Learn Today, \_\_\_\_\_\_ Tomorrow.” A) Innovate B) Earn FutureFunds C) Question Authority D) Be Curious*

I tapped "D," recalling their ever-present commercials. The tablet flashed green with a triumphant “cha‑ching!” Every head in the pod turned toward me, the first time anyone had looked up.

"Hey, dude," a voice whispered behind me. "The volume buttons are on the side."

I turned to see a kid my age. One look at his shaggy blond hair and dopey smile told me there wasn’t much difference between him and a golden retriever.

"Sorry, it’s my first day," I chuckled, clumsily feeling around the tablet.

"That’s alright," he grinned. "Wouldn’t want anyone counting, right?"

I chuckled again and moved on to the next question:

*“Every time you answer a question correctly, you earn \_\_\_\_ FutureFunds.”*

Amused, I tapped "9" repeatedly until the text box overflowed. The screen flashed red, and my balance dropped from eleven back to ten.

*“On a scale of 1–5, how much did you agree with this statement: ‘I feel prepared for my future career in retail and data collection.’”*

Any answer less than “5” grayed out the submit button and revealed a checkbox:

*\[ \] Are you sure? Please select additional coaching times. (Additional coaching must be done outside school hours, starting at just 15 FutureFunds per hour.)*

Frustrated, I tapped “5.” Green again.

By the end, my balance had sunk to six. The room sighed collectively as our tablets announced the session was over. As I logged off, the boy behind me tapped my shoulder and pointed at my lanyard.

"You work at the Cola‑Co Recharge Station too? What are your hours?"

"4:00 PM to 11:00 PM," I sighed. "My shifts start this week."

"Heck yeah! Bella’s our boss, but she's a senior. She’ll probably have me train you; might even get to slack off." He chuckled, offering his left hand. "I’m Ernie, by the way."

"Reed," I replied, shaking with my left hand awkwardly. He noticed.

"Sorry, haven’t done a non-Ranger handshake in a while. Did your old school have Zone Rangers?"

"Something like that," I lied. "But I never joined."

Ernie quickly tapped away at his tablet, soon mine buzzed with a flashing notification:

*Zone Rangers Meeting: Thursday 10:45 PM, ArcArcade.*

I looked back at Ernie, his grin still unwavering.

"Bella doesn’t care if we leave early Thursdays. You don’t have to come, but I think they’d want to meet you."

"Thanks, Ernie. I’ll think about it. This is all really different from my last school. I’m still trying to take it in."

"Think about it, Reedy," he said, nudging me. "Need help finding your room?"

"I'm okay, thanks." I waved. "I have everyth-"

"Everything on the tablet. Yep, figured." He tapped my shoulder and turned to leave. "See you at work, Reeds!"

I smiled and tapped the map icon. As it loaded, I thought about all the orientations and long conversations that led me here. I remembered my mom’s face when I got kicked out of her alma mater. Dad’s anger. The lies they told their friends about me. I didn’t just ruin my future; I torched their present. Still, my biggest fear wasn’t messing up again. It was not making another friend. I was lucky to meet someone like Ernie on day one. Realizing I was the only student left in the classroom, I quickly grabbed my tablet, passed the teacher’s desk, and smiled. She didn’t return it or even make eye contact. I stepped closer. Her eyes didn’t track me.

"Are you okay?" I asked. No name tag. Just “Facilitator” on her badge.

I waved my hand in front of her face. Nothing. I touched her shoulders to shake her gently. Her eyes moved, finally locking onto mine. Her gaunt eyes ping ponged in tandem with her facial muscles, twitching and spasming, before their unnerving tectonic movements stopped at all at once. She and I looked frozen at one another for several moments when I noticed she had started to drool. Her heavy husk fell forward onto me, unable to keep itself propped in its chair. I tried to catch her, but my left arm was pinned under her weight. I was trapped on the mildewed carpet, her cheek pressed to mine. Initially, I flailed my free limbs like a pill-bug placed upside down. When that didn’t work, I dug my nails into the floor to drag myself out. I heard a rip in my shoulder before I felt it. My scream silenced by the weight on my chest. I braced both feet against her and shoved, freeing my arm. Adrenaline carried me to the dorms. I reached for my badge, but my lanyard was gone. A hand grabbed my shoulder and yanked me into an open dorm.

"Reed?"

"Y-yes," I gasped. Ernie quickly shut the door behind me, cutting off a crowd of students.

"We’re in it now," he muttered, stacking furniture until he could reach the ceiling. He popped out a square ceiling tile and crawled into the dark.

"You coming?"

I followed Ernie, watching as he replaced the tile behind us. We crawled through a maze of wires and pipes, dimly lit by his tablet. The sound of the mob faded. Soon, blinking arcade machines replaced the noise. Ernie reached an intentionally placed brick and tapped it rhythmically against a red pipe. After a moment, a tile in front of us lifted. Bright white light spilled through. A long-necked boy in sport goggles peered up at us. With the brick still in hand, I worried Ernie would ruin whack-a-mole for me forever, but instead, the boy spoke, his tone annoyed.

"You're late," he said flatly, pushing his goggles up to his forehead. "And you brought a rookie."

"He’s with me.” Ernie shrugged from his crawlspace perch. “Reed, this is Zane. Zane, Reed. He’s new. Had the definition of a rough start."

"Looks like it," Zane muttered, eyes locking on the dirt and blood smudged on my sleeve.

He stepped aside to reveal a ladder descending into the room below. I hesitated, but climbed down behind Ernie, emerging into a repurposed stockroom lit by overhead grow lights and powered by a hacked-together tangle of cords and cables. Arcade machines roared behind the walls, their noise masking the work being done in this backroom.

“Is there no door to the arcade?” I asked meekly.

“There was.” hissed an annoyed older girl in a patched bomber jacket. She looked up, pausing her soldering to look me up and down. A ceiling fan rotated weakly above her, swaying just enough to keep the stench of burnt plastic moving.

"Who’s the kid?" she asked, turning back to resume her work.

"Name’s Reed," Ernie answered for me, dropping into a ratty office chair. "New Cola‑Co recruit, and future Zone Ranger."

"Nice to meet you, Reed. I’m Bella,” she grunted as she tucked her stray blonde hairs behind her ear. “Don’t touch anything."

Zane tossed me a warm bottle of SnackVault water and flopped onto a beanbag chair.

"You look like you’ve got questions."

"I... she just... collapsed," I said, massaging my injured shoulder. "And no one was around to help."

"Even if there was someone to help, they wouldn’t," Bella said, wiping her hands. "Most of the facilitators here are doped to the gills, every now and then, one zeroes out."

"Zeroes out?" I asked.

"They rely on FutureFunds too, when their balance runs dry, they lose access to their housing unit, food, and clinic.” She explained solemnly. “Happens more than they admit.”

I took a shaky sip of the water.

"So, what is this place? This… Zone Rangers thing?"

Zane rolled his eyes.

"Not the Boy Scouts Ernie probably sold you on. We’re glorified maintenance. Janitors. Techies. We’re the only ones keeping the place from eating itself."

Ernie grinned. "The extra funds every week doesn’t hurt either."

I tried to smile but failed.

"I appreciate your help, a lot.” I stammered over my words, trying not to offend my saviors, “But why invite me to join this secret club? Why bring me here?"

"Isn’t it obvious?" Ernie chimed, "We need someone to cover Monday cleanup rotations."

"Give him a break, Ernie.” Zane snorted. “This club ain’t secret, they’ve got us in every LearningZone. Ernie was eager to have a fresh pair of ears to talk off, like Josh.”

Ernie’s smile faded, and he stared at Zane with a seriousness I didn’t think he was capable of.

“Josh, he… zeroed out last week,” Ernie said through gritted teeth, “and you have his job and tablet.”

I froze. The bottle in my hand suddenly felt too heavy.

"We tried topping him off," Bella said quietly, eyes fixed on the circuit board. "We pooled what we had left, but the system flagged him anyway."

"They said he was transferred to a 'Vocational Bridge Program,'" Zane added, miming air quotes. "No one’s ever come back from one of those."

"His camera feed cut the day after,” Ernie shifted uncomfortably, “then his name vanished from the network. Like he never existed."

"We don’t think he died or anything," Bella said quickly. "We think they offloaded him somewhere."

Zane shrugged.

"Probably some warehouse job on the other side of the county, all we’ve got are theories." Zane added. "None of them good."

I tried to steady my breathing.

"Why hasn’t anyone tried to expose it?"

Zane looked up at me with a hollow expression.

"Everything here has an e-sig tying it back to you. everything you do here is recorded and stored. The second you step off property, your tablet’s wiped. They don’t connect to the outside world."

No one spoke for a while. The whir of the fan filled the silence.

PART II

Those first weeks unfolded not as days upon a calendar, but as uneven clicks some inhuman metronome measured. Every morning, I descended from my dormitory into the bowels of the reanimated mall. The air itself seemed charged with an unseen electricity, a static that clung to my skin. Ernie, ever jovial, led me through halls of screens and kiosks, where children’s laughter was smothered by the drone of bright advertisements that buzzed like flies around a corpse. I clung to his presence, not out of affection alone, but out of the primal knowledge that solitude here would drive me insane.

The days passed in cruel rhythm; study pods where the boredom dripped like venom, coating every thought with the taste of commerce and obligation; work shifts beneath the phosphorescent glow of Cola-Co logos, where my own reflection in the vending glass seemed stretched, half‑familiar, as though a more ravenous twin pressed against from within. Nights were no reprieve, the Zone Rangers’ hidden chamber overstimulated me with its glow of lamps and soldering irons, where Bella’s sharp voice cut the stagnant air, and Zane’s sardonic murmurs described fates worse than expulsion. The three of them treated their labors as ordinary, yet I could not help but sense that each flickering bulb and patchwork wire was less a rebellion than a ritual warding off the mall’s collapse.

Sleep eluded me. When I did collapse on the cot they provided, my dreams brimmed with visions of the mall as it once was: an endless atrium where the mannequins moved, their jointed arms raised not in retail display but in supplication to lights above that pulsed like distant stars. I would wake drenched, the echo of a carousel tune rattling through the ducts, though I knew the carousel had been dismantled years ago. No one else claimed to hear it, yet Ernie would sometimes glance at me with a sheepish dread, as if my terror had unlocked something his mind.

As my first weeks turned to months at Eastbrook’s LearningZone, each dream etched deeper into my marrow with the certainty that beneath the tiled floors and fluorescent hum, something vast called to me. In my dreams, the carousel had slumbered through the mall’s death, and now, in place of horses, Ernie, Zane, Bella, and the rest of my classmates were saddled, gold rods pierced straight through their backs and into the floor of the carousel. Some even bounced up and down as the carousel spun.

By day, my sleepless nights exacted their toll, and the toll was steep. I nodded through lectures in the pods, my eyelids drooping like curtains closing upon a crumbling stage. My answers faltered, trembling out half-formed, and the tablet punished me with merciless chimes, buzzing with penalties until the red counter of my FutureFunds drained away like sand through an hourglass. Each mistake was recorded in unblinking digits; each hesitation flagged as inefficiency. Facilitators, their eyes glazed by chemical sedation, marked my sluggishness with cold, mechanical disdain, their lips twitching with disapproval but never sympathy. The balance sank so low I could feel the maw of zero gaping before me, ready to strip me of even the meager comfort of meals.

At work, my decline became more pronounced. Cola-Co demanded precision, the syrupy levers requiring a steadiness I no longer possessed. My hands slipped, sticky rivulets soaking the counters. The neon lights seemed to pulse in mockery, casting jaundiced hues upon my trembling figure. The supervisor’s voice, flat and distorted through the comm, invoked Bella’s name as if summoning her to witness my disgrace.

“Correct him,” the voice ordered, and I shrank beneath its chill command.

Ernie tried to shield me, whispering warnings and jokes meant to steady my nerves, but even his laughter sounded muffled now, as though filtered through layers of grinding gears and dripping pipes. Each mistake bled more credits from me, every slip brought me nearer to the abyss where the tablet would blink crimson, the symbol of judgment, and the iron gates of sustenance would slam shut forever.

My reflection mocked me from the glass of the vending station. At first, I thought it was merely exhaustion: a face hollowed, mouth half-open, eyes sunken in shadow. But as I stared, I saw the faintest ripple, as if the figure beyond the pane shifted independently of me. My reflection’s lips twitched in a grimace I had not made. Its posture seemed bent, its head lolling toward the unseen depths below the counter. And then, more dreadful still, I perceived, beyond the glass, behind the wraithlike image of myself, the carousel’s shadow; its skeletal spokes revolving. The ghastly horses were gone, replaced by the silhouettes of children and adolescents, their bodies rising and falling on golden rods that pierced them through. They moved with dreadful obedience, puppets of some ancient merriment that had outlived its audience.

I staggered back, blinking, yet the vision clung to my sight like an afterimage of lightning.

“Jesus, are you alright, Reed?” Ernie asked. I tried to respond, but my words tangled in my throat, and I could only nod.

Even when I turned away, the rhythm of the carousel lingered in my skull, an unseen rotation pulling at my thoughts, threatening to grind my very will into dust. It was then I understood that exhaustion was no mere weakness, but a design. The LearningZone had no need of sleep. Sleep fractured resolve, sleep birthed terror, and terror carved obedience. Every moment awake was another strand woven into the invisible web that tightened around me. Every slip, every lost Fund, every reflection that smiled when I did not, each was a step closer to some inevitable reckoning that waited beneath the tiled floors and fluorescent hum, hungering with infinite patience.

I was at Zone Ranger HQ when the announcement thundered across the atrium, each syllable vibrating against the taut plastic banners that sagged above our heads, shaking dust loose from forgotten corners:

“Reed McIntosh. Report to the Principal’s Office immediately.”

The words clung to the walls like mildew, echoing through the empty service ducts until even the arcade machines seemed shushed into silence. Every neon bulb flickered in sympathy, stuttering in arrhythmic pulses. I felt the other Zone Rangers stiffen around me, their postures sharpened like blades sensing blood. Bella set her soldering iron down with unusual care, its tip still glowing as if reluctant to extinguish itself. Ernie’s grin, so constant it had seemed soldered to his face, faltered into a twitch of fear. Zane’s goggles reflected my pale face like a warped mirror.

“No one comes back from that,” Bella muttered, her voice brittle as glass. Each word snapped in the air as if she feared being overheard by something far beyond walls and vents.

Zane gestured toward the vent with a stiff hand. Ernie leaned closer, whispering so softly I almost mistook his voice for the drone of a dying lightbulb.

“You don’t have to go. We can hide you. People vanish when they answer that call.” His hand trembled on my shoulder, and for the first time I sensed his bravado was nothing more than armor, thin and dented.

But the announcement boomed again, my name, each letter distorted, dragged across the atrium as though chewed by something enormous and unseen. The sound was not merely heard but felt, a summons that permitted no refusal. The air ducts above us groaned, as if the very building yearned for my compliance.

“If you ignore it, they’ll send escorts,” Bella rose, crossing her arms to mask the unease etched on her face, “and you don’t want to see what kind of things walk with badges in this place.”

Her warning coiled inside me, feeding the dread already growing in my gut. I thought of the carousel from my dreams, its golden rods piercing the bodies of classmates, the endless rotation. Perhaps this was simply the next step: a ride that demanded I mount.

The Zone Rangers surrounded me, their expressions a broken constellation of fear, pity, and resignation. They had seen this before. They knew the shape of my path, though none dared to describe it aloud. Ernie’s lips parted as if to speak further, but the third announcement erupted, shaking the ceiling tiles loose so fine dust rained upon us like pale ash.

“Reed McIntosh. Principal’s Office. Now.”

The mall’s silence after the echo faded was unbearable, as if the building leaned closer, waiting.

“Are you coming, or what?” Asked Zane, halfway through the vent. “I’ve got the map written down. Anyone else coming?” I couldn’t help but feel tears well up in my eyes as Bella and Ernie stepped forward. It was nice to have such great friends in such dire circumstances.

Through the innards of Eastbrook we crawled, the intestines of the mall groaning with every metallic shift of pipe and duct. The air was dense, rank with popcorn grease and the chemical musk of old carpets. Zane went first, sneakers scraping aluminum, followed by Ernie, whose breathing was too loud in the confined dark. Bella followed, lips pressed into a tight line, her bomber jacket whispering like moth wings against the ducts. Zane brought up the schematics glowing faintly on his tablet; lines and circles flashing against his cheekbones, pale glyphs of a labyrinth none of us truly understood. I crawled last, the dread curling in my stomach thick as oil, every echo magnifying the conviction that unseen things were listening, cataloging our movements in silence.

“These schematics end here,” Zane whispered after a while, tapping the flickering screen. His words trembled, vibrating against the ductwork. “I-I’ve never gone this far.”

Bella froze, the weight of her stillness more terrifying than the noises we’d left behind.

“You’re telling me we’re blind now?”

Zane nodded, eyes downcast, the glow of the tablet painting him like a condemned man.

“Blind.”

We emerged into a cavernous corridor reeking of ammonia and mold, where the ceiling sagged like rotted flesh and every step sank into carpet sodden with unnamable fluids. The fluorescent bulbs above us buzzed like hornets, dim halos flickering to reveal stains both ancient and wet. The walls sweated, condensation dripping in erratic rhythms, as though mimicking the beating of some vast hidden heart. I felt the air itself resisting our intrusion, thick and damp, humming with vibrations beyond hearing. A chill skated my spine when shadows moved at the far end. They congealed into a group of students; bodies that still wore school uniforms, but whose faces shivered with grotesque undulations. Their features did not stay still; cheeks slid sideways, jaws collapsed inward only to reform, eyes drifted in their sockets like fish beneath ice. They mimicked the seizure I had seen in the facilitator, only now it was though they had accepted a new anatomy.

“Holy shit,” stammered Zane, “It’s Josh!”

At their head stood Josh. His jawline collapsed and reformed like clay pressed by invisible thumbs, his grin elastic and wrong. His skin looked less like skin and more like wax under heat, drooping in rivulets before crawling back into place. He wore his uniform still, but the badge on his lanyard had fused to his chest, sinking into the flesh as though it had always been part of him.

Before we could turn, hands like iron clamped onto our arms. Their touch was hot and clammy, as if blood surged under paper-thin skin. Their grip was merciless, fingers sinking into our flesh with the weight of inevitability.

 

PART III

They dragged us down a hidden stairwell that smelled of rust and pus, into a cavity the architects had never intended, a wound in the mall itself. The walls narrowed and the air grew hotter, the sound of dripping liquid echoing with maddening persistence. My lungs struggled, every breath clogged with the odor of charred plastic and putrefying meat.

At the core we found the source. A tumor of flesh filled the chamber wall to wall, pulsing and sputtering like an organ cut loose from its host. Its surface was a swollen landscape, glistening with translucent blisters that wept yellow pus in steady drops. Golden tubes, crude and countless, pierced its hide, their clear walls filled with fluids both dark and glowing; nutrients or poisons, it hardly mattered. The monster’s breaths were wheezes, cavernous and ancient, drawn from lungs far larger than the room could hold. It stank of rotting seawater and sweet decay, of something preserved past the limits of time. The floor beneath it quivered with each pulse, and I realized with horror that the mall itself was feeding this thing, its bones and walls nothing more than scaffolding for the living mass.

We were thrown to our knees before it, the others bowed low in rhythmic spasms, their movements synchronized like worshippers at some grotesque liturgy. Josh stood upright, his eyes now black pools that reflected no light. The tumor shifted, and I thought I glimpsed faces pressing outward from its surface, stretched thin as parchment; teachers, facilitators, students, all absorbed, their mouths opening in silent screams that merged into the low bass of the creature’s breathing. I could not move. The Zone Rangers flanked me, equally paralyzed, their eyes reflecting the pale ooze as if transfixed by an alien moon.

As it turned its unseen attention upon me, I felt the carousel’s song rise again from the ducts above, cheerful and inhuman, summoning me to ride forever.

Ernie, trembling but unwilling to bow, raised a broken pipe like a spear. His voice cracked as he shouted,

“We’re not letting you take him!”

He rushed Josh with desperate strength, the echo of his cry swallowed almost instantly by the chamber’s hungry acoustics. But Josh, no longer entirely human, caught him with unnatural grace and hurled him against the fleshy bulk. The surface split willingly to accept him, membranes stretching like lips. Ernie’s scream curdled the air as he was engulfed, the sound muffled into wet gurgles that rose and fell like a drowning hymn. The tumor convulsed, its tubing throbbing as if in ecstatic response. A moment later, Ernie stumbled back out, but changed; his face now sliding and twitching in that same inhuman rhythm, skin crawling as if it remembered other owners. His eyes flickered recognition, then drowned in madness. He lunged at us with a strangled roar, a puppet of the flesh.

The cavern descended into chaos, a symphony of wrenching steel and rupturing flesh that seemed to rattle the bones of the entire mall. Bella struck the mass with her wrench again and again, each swing cracking bone-like ridges and severing pulsating tubing, the clangs ringing out like church bells tolling for the damned. The air filled with the stink of burned meat and corroded metal, thick and unbreathable, every lungful tearing at my throat. Zane lashed at Josh with a length of cable, his hands trembling but his aim true, sparks jumping where metal met wet hide, the arcs illuminating Josh’s face; wide, impossible, stretching his face like an oil slick. Both Josh and the other’s movements no longer belonged to a man, but to a marionette jerked by unholy strings, their limbs twitching and snapping in angles that mocked Josh’s exact movements.

I scurried along the walls, desperately sliding my hands across the wall until I felt corroded panels still alive with flickering lights. Buttons and dials pulsed faintly as though feeding the monstrous tumor at the chamber’s heart. Each switch I flipped seemed to awaken another scream in the ducts, another convulsion from the mass that anchored itself to the mall. The sound was unbearable, thousands of voices woven into a single, mind-shattering note. The ducts groaned, shaking loose rust and dust like the coughing lungs of an ancient god. My panic deepened as I realized the very building was breathing with us, breathing against us.

We moved as one despite our terror, desperation soldering our mismatched souls into a single will to survive. Bella jammed the wrench deep into a main valve, twisting with all her strength until steam hissed like a dying breath and rivets popped from the walls like bullets. Zane ripped free the tubing in fistfuls, rancid fluids spraying in every direction, coating us in a stench that clung to skin and soul. The liquid burned on contact, leaving welts that pulsed in time with the creature’s own heartbeat. Josh shrieked, his voice overlapping itself in impossible harmonies, and lunged at me with jerking steps. I slammed my hand down on the fire alarm, its shriek echoing like a judgment trumpet across every level of the mall. The sound did not merely fill the air, it filled our bones, shaking our marrow, summoning echoes from corridors that had never known human voices. Josh and his cronies were no less affected, holding their misshapen ears in agony.

The walls trembled as if the mall itself was rising from slumber. From every vent came the carousel music, thin and warbling, a child’s tune drawn out into a dirge. I could see it in my mind, the carousel spinning in the darkness, rods piercing bodies that bounced in dreadful rhythm, eternally rising and falling to music no longer meant for joy.

We pressed forward, each action tearing at the heart of the thing. Flames erupted where cables sparked, setting banners and plastic drapes alight. The tumor writhed, its surface splitting open to reveal faces; facilitators, classmates, custodians, etched in transparent flesh, their mouths wide in soundless screams that merged into the alarm’s shriek. My stomach turned as I recognized some of them, those who had zeroed-out, now eternally grafted to the flesh, absorbed into its immortality. Their eyes rolled endlessly, following us in cycles as if trapped in a living ledger, tallying our every sin.

The chamber buckled. Fluorescent lights exploded in showers of glass and mercury, plunging us into a strobe-lit nightmare. Josh lunged again, but Bella swung the wrench one last time with a guttural scream, striking his temple. His head twisted too far, snapping like a hinge, yet his body continued to stagger toward us. Zane looped the cable around his limbs, jerking hard until bone cracked like kindling. Still Josh lunged, a distorted hymn echoing from his throat until the collapsing wall crushed him, silencing him in a spray of red mist. The creature howled, its voice not of one throat but of a million, echoing across dimensions, a vibration that seemed to pulse beyond the mall, beyond the county, perhaps even beyond the world.

The flesh mound writhed in agony, its tubes thrashing like serpents, its blisters bursting in explosive sprays of pus. Its howl was not a single voice but thousands; facilitators, students, janitors, all howling in overlapping despair, a chorus that rattled teeth and spine. The mall above began to burn, flames devouring banners, kiosks, pods, every false edifice of commerce and learning. Alarms wailed, sprinklers failed, and in their place came jets of blood-tinged water, spattering the screaming walls. The air reeked of charred plastic, ozone, and rot. The thing bellowed through every duct and corridor, its cry echoing in thousands of throats across the LearningZone, as though the whole student body had become its choir. Lights shattered, escalators collapsed, glass storefronts imploded in showers of shards. The mall itself seemed intent on swallowing us with its death throes.

“Through here!” yelled Zane, “This should lead us out.”

We scrambled into a storm pipe, the metal rattling under the mall’s convulsions, bolts loosening as though reality itself sought to spit us out. The tunnel vibrated like the throat of a colossal beast, hot gusts of air propelling us forward as if we were phlegm expelled by some titanic cough. Behind us the mass screamed again, and I swear I felt the sound as fingers dragging down my spine, promising we were only escaping a fragment of its body.

At last, we tumbled out of the pipe onto the shoulder of the highway, gasping under the indifferent night sky. The air smelled clean, a cruelty after what we had left. Cars slowed, headlights sweeping over our ruined faces, their occupants staring as if we were revenants risen from tar. None stopped; they accelerated instead, unwilling to risk contagion of whatever we carried. Behind us the Eastbrook Mall roared with fire, its glass ceiling collapsing inward in sheets of molten light. Embers ascended like unmoored souls, drifting heavenward before vanishing into the dark. The flames painted the horizon crimson, and for a fleeting instant it seemed as though dawn itself had arrived to cleanse the world.

We stood there, the three of us, watching our prison collapse into ash. Bella’s hands still clenched the wrench, knuckles white, as though she feared letting go would invite the thing to reclaim her. Zane’s goggles reflected the inferno, and in their lenses, I thought I glimpsed faces dancing in the flames, not consumed but waiting. My own reflection in the highway guardrail showed eyes wider than I thought possible, pupils dilated into endless black, and I knew the carousel’s rhythm still turned inside me. Yet the silence between heartbeats whispered of unfinished horrors. It wasn’t destroyed, not truly. I couldn’t shake the thought that somewhere beneath the ruins, in the depths no flame could cleanse, that thing might still twitch, dreaming of us, dreaming of others, its roots stretching unseen to every LearningZone that had replaced every dead mall across the nation. The carousel would keep spinning, and sooner or later, we would be called back to ride.
