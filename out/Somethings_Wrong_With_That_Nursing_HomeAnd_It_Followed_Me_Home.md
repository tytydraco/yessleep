Back in college, I scored a part-time gig at this nursing home outside town. Security, they said, but it was barely that—just walking the grounds every 2 hours, flashlight in hand. The layout creeped me out from day one: security shack and admin offices jammed near the exit, like they wanted to bolt if shit went down. Should’ve been a red flag, but the pay? Insane. Enough to cover rent and then some. The manager, Hargrove—a wiry guy with a permanent frown—laid it out: patrol on schedule, don’t bug the residents, don’t step inside unless you’re told. “They don’t like interruptions,” he growled, staring me down. I nodded. Cash was cash.

The residents were old—some real ancient—but not how you’d expect. Every few days, one kicked it, clockwork. Yet they were… alive. Sharp. Happy, even. I’d never seen a nursing home before, but I figured they’d be depressing as hell—gray folks waiting to die. Not here. These people moved fast, talked faster. And it wasn’t just old-timers; half the newbies were middle-aged when they rolled in. I broke Hargrove’s rules once, chatted up this guy, Leonard, on a slow night. Said he was 58. Looked 80—hunched, wrinkles deep as cracks. But his mind? Razor-sharp. Knew stuff I’d never heard of, even walked me through a stats problem I was bombing in class. Everyone there was like that—caught them arguing philosophy once, like a freaking TED Talk.

Hargrove was a ghost. Never went near the main building, just hovered by the office, barking at me through the radio. Staff was nonexistent—residents didn’t need help. When they died, it was instant. Saw a body once, old guy on a stretcher, face calm—smiling, almost. Too damn happy for a corpse.

I’d been there 2 months when I noticed the pattern: middle-aged folks checked in, aged overnight, then dropped dead. Weeks, sometimes days. Drugs? Brainwashing? Some twisted lab shit? I got curious—stupid, cursed curious. Watched closer. Every morning, every night, they’d shuffle to this basement hall. I’d checked it on patrol—massive, empty, concrete box, nothing in it. But down there, they’d do this slow, creepy exercise routine—arms out, legs bending, all in sync. Not a cult, I swear. No prayers, no chants. Religion? They mocked it—heard one call it “kid’s stuff” mid-laugh.

Leonard’s son came once, maybe 30, jaw dropped seeing his dad like that. Begged him to leave. Leonard wouldn’t budge, just kept saying “wisdom” like a broken record. They yelled; the son stormed off, screaming he’d sue Hargrove. Hargrove shrugged—didn’t blink. Leonard was dead by the weekend.

That basement stuck with me. One night, I snuck down there, 3 a.m., dead quiet. Nothing—no machines, no answers. Just that floor. Felt soft under my sneakers—not mushy, just… giving. Warm. Soothing, like sinking into a bath. I wasn’t stoned—it just felt right. Next day, I nailed a chem quiz I hadn’t studied for. Then an essay—perfect score. I kept going back, slipping down at night. School got effortless—I’d ace tests without cracking a book. But then I saw it: lines around my eyes. Hair in the sink. At 20.

It clicked. Skip the basement, and my brain turned to mush—couldn’t focus, couldn’t think. One night down there, and I’m back, sharp as hell. I got cocky—thought I’d ride this edge, pay off my loans before I went full grandpa. Dumbass move. Hargrove caught me one night, flashlight on my back. Didn’t say a word—just fired me. Whatever. I’d saved enough to call it a win.

Then the nightmares hit. A month out, every night’s the same: I’m in that basement, moving with them, those slow stretches. The floor’s soft again—but it’s flesh now. Thick, wet, throbbing. Ceiling’s the same—meat, dripping, like we’re inside something breathing. My legs start dissolving, skin sliding off, soaking into that bloody mess below. I wake up gasping, drenched, shaking. At first, I still wanted it—craved that basement like a junkie. But the dreams broke me. Terror won.

Last week, I woke up pinned to the dirt outside the nursing home fence. New security guy—huge, buzzcut—had me down, asking what the hell I was doing. I stammered about the basement; he shrugged, said he never stayed down there long. Didn’t believe me. Figured I was sleepwalking—let it slide, no cops. Next night, same thing. And the next. He’s used to it now—catches me stumbling up the road. I begged him: “Stop me if I get close. I don’t know what I’ll do in there.” He didn’t get it, but he swore he’d block me—can’t risk his job.

I’m down to 2 hours of sleep a night. Any longer, and I dream—then I’m walking, pulled back to that place. I’m terrified. What’s in that basement? It made me smart, it’s making me old, it’s melting me in my sleep. I can’t stop it—feel it slipping in even now, that warm, soft pull. Someone tell me what’s down there before it swallows me whole.
