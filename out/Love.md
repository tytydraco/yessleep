Dark, cold, and stormy, a typical horror movie setup, Audrey thought, on her way to her house. She had been shopping earlier that day, and yet still, all alone on Christmas Eve, not even a Christmas "miracle" could save her from her grim fate of being alone. She had always been labeled an outcast, always rejected, no one to write home to for the holidays, no one to spend time with. She was desperate, always searching for something that would never come, yet still staying hopeful.



On her journey home, the only sounds accompanying her silence were the raindrops lightly hitting her car's recently painted roof. She arrived at her home and came to a sudden stop in her front yard, as her garage was being renovated. She didn't need the extra space, but she figured if she and her future partner could start a family together, it would come in handy. The loud crash of the door slamming shut echoed into the sky, being muffled by thunder.



She pulled out her keys from her... left... no, right back pocket, and produced a melodic jingle. The keys fell, as always, and Audrey, under her breath, muttered, "Fuck," as her dog began barking. The sound, although small, she figured, was loud enough to have awoken her dog sleeping peacefully in the kitchen. She opened the door. No comfort, no warm greetings, just her cold apartment.



Her dog had stopped barking, and she called out to it, "Come here, boy, momma's home." The rain had suddenly stopped as she repeated her calling, although louder. She could hear her dog whimpering, but she couldn't tell where the sound was coming from. She frantically tried flicking the light switch, but the power was out. She was visibly scared—darkness takes all the comfort of knowing what's around you away, distorts your vision and memory, and makes it completely unknown.



She stumbled into her living room, trembling. The whimpering stopped, and a sense of calm washed over her. Still not able to see anything, her eyes had adjusted to the dark, and she could just barely make out her furniture and décor pieces. She thought nothing of her lounge chair, except she didn't have one. She walked back to the kitchen, unpacking all of the groceries she had just bought, but was interrupted by a loud thud.



She turned around, facing the dark, facing her fear. "Is... is anyone there?" she whispered with a higher-pitched voice. The chair had started to move. Her vision? She rubbed her eyes, but it kept on moving, edging closer to her until she could just make out the corners of a grin, white eyes, pupils as black as the night sky, dilated fully, letting every bit of Audrey in.



She froze, cold, standing helplessly, a towering figure standing in front of her, looking at her from above. Everything went silent. She had been knocked out by the man, hit with a small blunt object, a bat. She awoke with her hands chained, eyes covered, and mouth stuffed with some material. She felt bumps and heard the screeching of a car. The rain was back, but lighter this time.



Old-timey music filled the car she was in, vibrating against her back. The car stopped, and a door was opened. She stayed quiet to hear if someone had saved her. Why stop? She could faintly make out, between the sounds of raindrops, the crackling of leaves. The compartment she was in was forcefully opened. She lay stiff as a statue, feeling her kidnapper's gaze upon her.



She was picked up and carried, two doors being opened. She knew it was a building connected to the outside world because she could feel the rain on her. She was thrown into a room, and the door was shut. She managed to move her hands a bit, as the cuffs were loosely stuck onto her hands, not fitting correctly. She removed the blindfold covering her eyes and looked around.



She was quickly hit with the image of the man, this time seated, looking over at her. Bald, dark eyebrows, a well-defined jawline. He let out a laugh, very low-pitched, and spoke no words. She was silent, just taking it all in, still frozen in fear. She was intimidated. The man got up and hit her with his bare hands, her cheek turning red. She couldn't speak, only whimpered, and the man continued laughing but turned his back to her, lying on the ground.



Audrey began crying, and everything went silent again. The man had left. She had never felt this hopeless before. Through her sobbing and whimpering, she fell asleep. The man once again entered, and by her, went to his knees. He started stroking her hair, tangling it with his fingers. He had also always been lonely. Audrey abruptly woke up during this time and could make out through a faint buzzing the sobbing of her kidnapper.



He trailed down, resting his hand on her thigh. Although the situation was dire, she had never felt affection like this before. A part of her liked it; the other was terrified. The man fell asleep next to her, holding her close, giving her warmth. Inner peace came over both of them—perhaps the unknown wasn't all that bad.



Hours later, Audrey was woken up by the piercing screeching sounds of metal being dragged over something repeatedly. The man started walking over to her after he saw her shock and twitch from fear. Heavy footsteps, homing in on her. Each step produced a deep thud, each one hitting harder than the last as they got louder until they stopped right in front of her.



The man's hands covered her face; they felt like leather. Her blindfold was, this time, taken off, and the object in her mouth as well, and she was face-to-face with her captor. He wasn't bald, just had very short hair. Sunlight from a crack above shone on his face; his eyes reflected the most pure green color Audrey had ever seen—looks can be deceptive. His pupils were now small, still black, with a white dot shimmering from the center.



Audrey was speechless, and the man shook, turning around in an instant, covering his face. He began sobbing with his back turned to Audrey, lying on the floor. She spoke, "No, no, don't cry... I think you look pretty." The room went silent. The sobbing ceased, and he asked her, "Do you mean that?" while rubbing his nose and eyes. Now facing her, Audrey nodded.



He brought her up to her feet, towering over Audrey, looking down. She felt like an ant in the presence of a giant, a snake. Separated by an arm's length, Audrey was still stiff. She was shocked by the man—how could someone that wants to hurt you be so genuine and kind? She wondered, perhaps they were more similar than Audrey could ever care to admit.



He looked into her eyes, picking out the deepest corners of her darkness. From within, it bled through; it bled through to her eyes. Audrey loosened up when he seemed to calm down, and once again, she felt at peace. She had always longed for someone who could understand her. She was still terrified, of change—not of him.



She wasn't a people person, ever, but someone taking her made her feel wanted, a sickening sense of dread coexisting with her need to feel whole. Although not speaking much, they spent hours together, just looking, staring. Some say beauty lies within the eyes, but the man had found more of her to love. He had always wanted this too, but fear is stronger than love, both primitive by nature, both misunderstood by all.



Hatred filled him from tip to toe. He was an angry man by nature, although appearing collected; his insides were a mismatch of bits, clinging onto each other, held together by weak glue, his will to be better. Suddenly, he snapped. He was too vulnerable. He threw her down and hit her once more, out cold.



Audrey abruptly woke up once again in his car, this time without her blindfold. She could see a lever; she could escape, but where would she go? She didn't have anything. Without him, she was nothing. Although fast, she had felt attracted to him, a feeling she had never experienced before. She stayed put, but this time no music was playing, and she could only hear the tires skidding.



They stopped, and he took her out. They stopped in a wooded area. The sunlight from before had faded, and it was pitch black. He spoke, this time more high-pitched, looking at Audrey, straight into her eyes, searching for something, although he didn't know what. His words, "I've always loved you, Audrey," came straight from his heart. Deep down, he too was vulnerable. It pierced her, and she just held him, gripping tightly.



He followed it up with, "And we have to be together forever." Audrey nodded, agreeing, both with tears in their eyes. He forced her to let go as he walked to the back of his car, rummaging through everything. Audrey could only hear metal clashing together. After stopping, he pulled out a shovel. Audrey didn't feel fear, as she couldn't see him—she was looking down.



As abruptly as it had started, it had ended. Everything went black, and the man put her in his passenger seat, happy once more.



Audrey was never alone; she just didn't know where to look. I was always with her, always in love.



Her shitty little boyfriend won't miss her anyway
