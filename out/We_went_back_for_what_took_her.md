It’s been ten years since we came here.

The air is still just as thick with salt and seaweed.

We were warned daily about the unapologetic tides that would entrap you. But we didn’t care this time.

The first time we tried, it changed us forever. Andy refused to eat for months. Matt couldn’t sleep alone. The sight of it still keeps me awake most nights. But this time was different. We were more prepared for the unforeseen.

Sheer cliff faces of razor-sharp slate hung over us. All I could think about was how easily we could be decapitated. Seagulls hovered above, waiting for our demise and another easy lunch. They cackled to one another as they tracked our every movement.

“This time we move slower,” Andy whispered.

By the look in his eyes, I knew it was too late to suggest turning back.

“If you see anything like before, then we—”

“We what?” I asked.

Matt was staring into the sunlit horizon. Without looking at us, he said, “Once we reach the path, we’ll be closer than ever.”

“It’ll be dark soon,” I said. “Did we bring torches this time?”

I already knew the answer.

The pebbles beneath us were like bars of soap, slick with seaweed. Every step had to be planned. If we slipped, it was a long fall into the black ocean, with no way back up.

My greatest fear wasn’t the destination.

It was falling before we could reach it.

The waves slammed into the rocks with violent indifference. The cliff base looked like an open jaw, waiting to be fed. High tide was coming.

When we finally reached the narrow path carved into the cliff face, the ache returned. That deep, familiar pain that reminded me what we lost last time.

Jade was sweet. Brave in the way only naïve people are. We told her not to come. She followed us anyway.

I still remember telling her mother. The sound she made didn’t feel human.

They said Jade slipped.

They said the path was untrodden.

They were wrong.

The cave waited for us exactly where we remembered it.

A black wound in the cliff face.

The entrance was wide enough for two people to stand side by side. Inside, the darkness swallowed sound. Even the ocean felt muted near it, as if the cave itself was listening.

We stepped in.

The temperature dropped instantly.

Water dripped somewhere far inside. Each echo sounded wrong, delayed, as though the cave was deciding whether to return it.

The further we went, the narrower it became. The walls pressed closer, scraping our shoulders. Then our backs. Then our chests.

We had to turn sideways.

Andy’s breathing grew shallow.

Matt whispered, “It didn’t used to be this small.”

The ceiling lowered. The floor sloped downward. We were no longer walking into the cave.

We were descending into it.

My hand brushed something wet on the wall. It wasn’t water. It pulsed faintly, like muscle beneath skin.

I pulled back.

That’s when we heard it. Not a sound. A movement.

Deep within the stone.

Something shifted, slowly, carefully, as if it had been waiting for us to return.

Andy froze.

Matt whispered my name.

And from somewhere ahead, in the deepest part of the narrowing dark, something exhaled.

Long and wet…And far too close.

Then it began to crawl toward us.
