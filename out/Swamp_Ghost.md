“So tell me soldier, in what war have you fought?” the captain asked as we sailed through the swamp. I looked at the river ahead and mulled on the answer, the flies swarming all around us while the smell of rot hung in the air. The heat was almost unbearable this time of the year and I really did not care for it. “I fought the jungle war if that is what you are askin’ and honestly it wasn’t worth the money they paid. We weren’t fighting soldiers but village people who were defending their lands.”

He looked on knowing what I meant, he did not say anything till we reached the pier. There as I stepped out the boat he put a hand on my should and spoke “I know you don’t want to preached to but understand this brother, war is a cancer that will either kill you or eat you from within. I have seen too many die fighting wars long after the real ones ended. Take care and if you need a job you know where I am.” I nodded and left him standing there on the boat. I walked on the shaky pier to a man waiting at the end, he was a little overweight but the only person who knew how to make me laugh. “Look at the most sorry, dried up and hungry catfish I have ever laid my eye on. Come here so I can fatten that that useless body you keep hauling about.” I smiled, Jared was just an old friend but to me he was the only family I had.

“I hope this time the meat will be soft, last time you made me eat leather and down it with piss water.” He laughed and gave me a bear hug before I could even move out. I smelled the cheap whisky on him and this brought back old memories. “Lissen, I make the best barbequed meat in this swamp and you know that, lass time was because the gator was old. I pro.. promise this time we will hunt something so you know it will be soft.”

“Wait we are going hunting?”

“Yup, hunting season ends today so this is the only chance you get to hunt some prime meat. You know how it is these days, the laws are changin’ and there’s nothing we can do about it.” I just stared at him, I was tired and needed a drink. Trust Jared to weasel out of a deal, he was supposed to pay for the first meal I had when I got back alive. Putting my rucksack down I stretched and felt all the joints crack like an old man then looked at his old pickup that I spent more time fixing than driving. It was still a shitbox but its all we had. Shaking my head I agreed and we were off to the hunting grounds. On the way I checked the old rifle we were to use and spoke about the war, Jared being an idiot acted like he just came back from the war rather than me but that suited me.

Once there we got out the truck and checked the rest of the gear and set out, I was tired but knew if I did not do this then I would be sleeping under the stars with the gators. We walked through the swamping marsh using a guide stick to make sure the ground was solid, it was a long trek to the hunting ground. We finally reached the spot and started to look for tracks or signs off any feral hogs, they had been breeding like crazy and the hunting season was them only. As he stalked further into the swamp forest I could not find an tracks but felt uneasy, the place was silent, too silent. It was as if the swamp was holding its breath for something, I kept my eyes and ears open to anything. As we made our way back to the truck I stopped and Jared almost fell into me, just as he was about to burst out I raised my hand silencing him. There was a sound coming from within the forest, it was faint at first but it was getting louder. I tried to listen but it was to far away and I had to stop just to pinpoint the location.

Just as we were about to move forward a loud shriek was heard coming from our left, I turned to see what it was and raised my rifle on the ready. The trees were thick in that part of the swamp so I could not make out the source “h.. hey Mart, you ever heard about them banshees or somethun?”

I turned to Jared and looked at him oddly, he in turn shrugged and continued “lissen I heard there is something in them woods that has been huntin’ peoples.”

I shook my head, “so you decided to bring me here to do what, hunt the thing?”

“No, this is our usual place. Look, that thing or the stories started just a couple of months ago. I didn’t pay it mind but …” just then the shriek came again and it was closer, we ran the other direction. Running through the trees and swamp was no easy task but we had to run, the shriek was getting louder and closer. I saw a ditch and pointed it to Jared and once we reached it we both dove in and scrambled up the side and held our breaths. We were both covered in mud and looking up at the entrance, the shriek came again and it was close. I heard flapping and within a second something swooped past our ditch that looked a shadow moving like an airplane. I was scared and could hear Jared whispering a broken prayer under his breath. We waited for what felt like hours before we moved again, I moved up the ditch to see if it was still around but the shrieking had gone and there was nothing around us. Jared curse and spoke about soiling himself, I told to shut it so I could listen. He then tried to get out the ditch and before I could stop him he was out and moving to the truck, it was maybe a mile away so I had to scramble after him as we practically ran to the truck. The shrieking returned and we now doubled our speed, reaching the truck Jared jumped into the passenger seat while I had no choice but to run around and get in the driver’s seat. Once inside I started the truck and gunned the gas, did not care where we were going but I needed to get the hell away from this place.

“What in the actual fuck was that thing Jared, what hell is going on here. I leave for a couple of years and all of a sudden you guys have a devil in the swamp? What the fuck is going on?”

Jared was too scared to speak and kept looking at the back, his eyes were moving in every direction trying to find whatever that thing was. “Lissen I told you what I heard. Them Lewis boys told me about the thing, they said it was hunting people. I had no idea they was telling the truth, honest. We need to get out of here before we’re food for it.”

I just looked ahead and drove, no idea where we were going but I was feeling better just being as far away I could from this thing. “So no one is hunting the thing?”

“Last I heard was that old mama Betty said she would rustle up here people and try to catch the thing. I heard nothing after that, I kept myself out the picture ‘cause they was trying to enlist anyone to go hunting for that thing. Lissen Mart I had no idea it was all the way there, I thought it would be closer to the Marrows not here.”

“Well its here now and we are fucked if we don’t find…” just then something slammed the truck from my side, I tried my best to keep the truck from crashing and I just managed while Jared had bent over crying like a child. I looked at the mirrors trying to find the thing while keeping the truck from flying of the road. It was no where to be seen, then I saw a shadow moving from behind and it slammed the truck from the rear. I kept the truck moving but knew that another slam might just tip the truck. I tried everything possible like moving the truck from side to side to help me from being slammed again. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, we are so fucked Mart.”

“Shut the fuck up Jared, I am trying to keep us alive. The road was blur to me and so was everything else, I needed to get to town if we were to survive this. Bracing for another attack I kept the truck at a steady pace, after about 45 minutes we reached the town and I finally slowed down. I could see the lights of the town and houses, I was able to breath out finally. I sniffed the air in the truck and realised that Jared had actually shit his pants and I swore at him. One in town I stopped at the first bar we came across and I jumped out, only to realise how much mud was on me and I ran my hands over my face I could feel the thick clay flaking off. Looking at the damage on the truck I was blown away, the entire side the truck was bent inwards and so was the back. The truck looked like it had crashed into a tree.

“Looks like the tree won there Martin, what happened?” I turned to see the speaker and found it was Benji, a local. “Something in the swamp hit the truck, I have no fucking idea but it was fast.”

Benji looked at the damage closely as more people were now coming to see, I saw the local deputy also join the small crowd. Jared remained in the truck huddling in the seat like a scared child. “I wish I could say good to see you Martin but it seems you met our local boogey man. Can you tell me what happened?”

I nodded but told him I need a beer and change of clothes first. The deputy nodded and pointed me to the motel across, I picked my rucksack from the back of the truck and picked Jared from the truck and followed the Deputy. He led us to the motel, sniffing the air even he realised that Jared had shit his pant and laughed. “Seriously Jared, here you preach about hunting the damn thing and when you met it you shit your pants?”

Jared was not amused but I could see he was shell shocked by the experience. Getting to the motel the Deputy got us a room so Jared and I could clean up, I had spare clothes but Jared on the other hand had to wait for his dad to bring them for him after the deputy called him. It felt good to finally have shower and put on some clean clothes, I left Jared in the room waiting for new clothes while I followed the deputy back to the bar.

I gave him the full account on what happened, and he whistled at the end, we were joined by another deputy who just sat there stoic listening. “Whatever that fucking thing is I am sure happy that you survived it. We have been getting reports that people are going missing out there but no idea what was causing it. Well Martin we need more than a shotgun to get this thing.” I nodded to this but knew this wasn’t my war anymore. I was itching to leave now, leave this godforsaken swamp and find a better place away from the curses of this land.
