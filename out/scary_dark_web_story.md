I was 17 when this happened, I heard about the dark web before but I wasn't really into that.  
I started watching these horror stories on youtube, and some of them were about them going in the darkweb and some spooky shit happens. like people coming to their houses and stuff, I didn't  really believe in that stuff  
So one day I decided to download the Tor browser and go on the dark web, pretty usual illegal stuff, weapons for sale, organs for sale, C P, Drugs, bitcoin and stuff like that.

I was going through for sometime clicking random stuff, and I thought only maybe an hour had passed, but it was like 1 a.m. I usually sleep at 10 p.m.  
I was pretty lost at this point don't know what I was clicking and I clicked on this one link that led me to a site which had a red color them there were videos and pictures of where people being killed, murdered, or tortured  
there were lots of videos of them, i remember there was a video of 2 girls, young, I think around the ages 17-25 maybe, i don't know but they were pretty young, they were tied up in the middle of a forest, they were laughing  or crying it was hard to tell, about something, the video was only about 40 seconds, so while there laughing this guy comes up and shoots both of them in the face with a pistol,

I was fucked and disgusted at that point because I didn't think I see that shit, I was in complete shock  
these videos were on a high resolution, not 4k or 8k, but like in 1080p. to the point where i can recognize the victims clearly. poor souls may they rest in peace.

there were more videos of people getting murdered, another one was a woman being tied up in a forest and 2 people come and start beating her and cutting her with machetes. one of them then started cutting her throat, there was nothing she could do her mouth was covered with a cloth, her race was black that's all I could say about here.

another one where a woman was tied up and she was facing the camera, she was crying and few seconds later someone comes up with a rifle and shoots her in the head. pretty fucking disgusting

I was so horrified and disgusted I closed the browser and uninstalled it and set my wallpaper to a religious background and I prayed that, for this stuff to not happen and I turned off the computer and went to bed I was shaking and I couldn't sleep, because I was covered in sweat. this bullshit was stuck in my mind for few days straight,

anyway I am better now , still feared of that stuff but not as much, I prayed basically everyday for the first few days after that encounter,

I am feeling a lot better now, and I believe that the people that actually do this stuff are gonna face consequences, by law or by nature, and the victims are probably unlucky souls or bad people that have done similar things.  
So basically it's just going round and round until one of them realizes and stops. maybe the victims did something to piss them so bad, or they messed with the wrong people,  
I still think of this from time to time,  
if you are planning on going on the dark web, I encourage you not to, this stuff is bad and I don't think people should see this stuff, because they will get stuck in our mind and could lead to bad decisions in the future

Thanks for reading, I wish every one good health, and never be involved in shit like this. it was pretty scary for me at least, because i was never into that stuff.  
and always remember if someone pisses you off or is trying to provoke you, just ignore them  
don't get into fights. because someday you are gonna wish you never did.  
Take care now, bye
