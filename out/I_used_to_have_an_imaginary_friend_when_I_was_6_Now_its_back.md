In the early 2000s, I had an imaginary friend named ED. I thought I was the only one who could see him, of course. My parents assumed it was just a phase and didn’t think much of it.

Ed and I used to hang out mostly in my room or up in the treehouse. He was a tall, slender man with a thin, unsettling smile and extremely pale skin. Every year on my birthday, I’d find an extra present waiting in my room. No one ever saw who left it.

Each time, it was a small bone.

After my 10th birthday, ED disappeared—and the presents stopped too.

It’s been 10 years now. Today is my 20th birthday.

I live alone in a small apartment about fifteen minutes from my childhood home. I spent the day with my family; they took me out for a nice dinner. We laughed, we hugged, and then we parted ways. I headed home, looking forward to a quiet night.

When I arrived, I noticed the front door was unlocked. I paused.

Maybe I forgot to lock it…?

I stepped inside, flipped on the lights, and rounded the corner. That’s when I saw it.

A small box with a bow. And a card.

I froze.

“Is this some kind of prank?” I muttered, trying to laugh it off.

But the laugh didn’t come.

I opened the card.

**“Happy 20th Birthday! I missed you. – ED.”**

My heart dropped.

I stared down at the box. It looked just like the ones from childhood—simple, wrapped with a red bow. I hesitated, then carefully opened it.

Inside was a freshly amputated human finger.

I gasped and dropped the box. It hit the floor with a sickening thud.

That’s when I noticed the blood.

A thin trail of it led to the closet near the door. The knob creaked as it slowly began to turn on its own.

Then the door opened with a blood-curdling groan.

And there he was.

Ed.

He was older now, but still tall and deathly pale. His face had the same thin smile—but his eyes were wild, manic. He wore a tattered, stained outfit that looked like it belonged in a long-abandoned asylum.

His left hand… it had no fingers. Fresh wounds at the nubs.

**“I won’t let them separate us again!”** he screamed, charging at me.

He tackled me to the floor and tried to jam his bloody, fingerless hand into my mouth. I screamed as I felt my teeth shatter under the pressure. More blood poured from his mutilated stump as the skin tore against my broken teeth.

I flailed, blindly reaching for anything.

My hand closed around something cold and metal.

The knife.

The same one he must’ve used to cut off his finger.

I stabbed him—hard—into the side of the neck. Blood erupted, spraying across the room like a firehose, painting the walls and carpet in deep, violent reds.

But he didn’t stop.

His body thrashed violently, using every last ounce of strength to choke the life out of me. My vision blurred. My lungs burned. The warmth of his blood poured down my throat.

Just as I was about to surrender to the inviting pull of unconsciousness—

He fell off me.

I coughed up blood and shards of my own teeth. My hands trembled. My entire body was in shock.

I passed out.

When I woke up in the hospital, they told me I’d developed aspiration pneumonia from inhaling so much blood. I’d also need extensive dental reconstruction. But I was alive.

I let out a shaky breath and turned my head to the side, grateful to have survived.

That’s when I saw it.

On the table beside my hospital bed—

A small gift box.

With a card.

Labeled, **“From ED.”**
