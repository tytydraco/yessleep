I’ve tried to write this over and over again, about a week after it started. I hope as you read my story… I hope it makes sense why I avoided telling someone about her or asking for help. It started as innocent fun, a little bit of paranormal stuff uplifting what could be considered a pretty average almost boring life. 

I’m 25, fresh out of college and six months ago I inherited a house from my grandparents. They owned a lot of properties, some were sold to the people that at the time were renting them. 

While the rest of the properties were distributed between family members. As far as I know no one chose to live in any of the houses and either sold them or set up airbnb’s. So I’m the only one that chose to keep and live in the house. It’s weird to think, this was theirs even though they never lived here. 

Anyway, the house was a godsend. It's not old, or big, and aside from a funny smell, that I seemed to not be able to wash away the first few weeks, it made me feel safe, like I had nothing to worry about for the coming months or years trying to find a footing as a functional working member of society. 

At first I was scared the neighbors would be a problem, they seemed to pay a lot of attention whenever I got out of the house and came back from work. Most of them are old folk so I decided to just talk to them. That's how I met Lisa, the lady from across the street. After approaching her for the first time our conversation went a little bit like this:

“¿So you don't know the people that used to live here dearie?” She asked. A fair question, I know, but something in her voice was… uneasy?

I explained to her how the house was previously owned by my grandparents and they never actually lived in it, nor do I know or have a way to contact the previous tenants. After that she sighed, offered to bake me some cookies and waved me off as I got into my car and went to work.

Now that I think about it, after that morning all the other neighbors seemed to withdraw their attention. That’s also when the dreams started.

¿Have you ever dreamt with complete emptiness? Imagine you are floating inside a swimming pool with your eyes closed. That’s how the first dreams were, peaceful, hell I remember waking up feeling amazing. The first week was just like that, all my stress and problems seemed to melt away after dreaming with that peaceful emptiness. 

My mood improved so much my friends at work started to ask if I was, you know, taking something either to help me sleep or to get that sweet energy boost. I laughed it off with them and alluded to hard drugs just to keep it funny. Then the whispers started. 

The first time I heard her she just said my name. 

“Connor” 

Over and over again. 

I woke up a little weirded out, but still with that sweet sensation that comes with a good full night sleep. Here’s where time starts feeling… funny? For the life of me I couldn't describe to you how long the different kinds of contact lasted before getting worse. All I’m sure its the order and how after calling my name and getting no response, she probably started to get impatient and then… 

Then, she started asking things. 

“Connor, are you awake?”

“Connor, can you hear me?”

Nothing changed much after the questions started, always repeating, always in a sweet whisper, but never menacing. The first thing that struck me was curiosity. What the hell am I thinking that could cause these dreams? And if I decided to try and answer, would that be like talking to myself? 

As time went by, the whispers became more insistent, faster, but never more than just whispers. I was afraid to answer, or maybe I just wasn't sure how to, in the end I decided to just concentrate my thoughts, imagine myself talking. And it worked. 

“Connor, would you please answer me?”

“I don’t know how.” I was afraid that focusing so hard on a single thought would just bolt me awake, like it always happens when you figure out you are in a dream and try to change something, that feeling where your brain catches you cheating and pulls you back to real life. But she answered. 

“I knew you were going to answer” 

I wanted to reply with a sarcastic remark, about how this mysterious whisper knew I was going to answer because it's just part of my subconscious or even my imagination. At that stage I was convinced the whisper was me and I was the whisper. But complex answers like that proved impossible for a while. And so our daily conversation repeated for a while, just like this.

“Connor, would you please answer me?” 

Followed by me, trying to explain why I couldn't.

“I can’t.” 

“I… awake.” 

“You… me… are.” 

Communication proved impossible, but also a challenge. How far can I prove my subconscious? Now looking back I know I should have backed away, asked for help, but at the time I was just curious. 

By now you might be asking yourself why I refer to the whisper as “Her”, well at first I wasn’t sure, as much as I tried to concentrate it was just a nondescript voice, it was until the instructions started that it became clearer. 

After weeks of trial and error I guess she grew tired instead of bored. 

“I need you to do something for us, Connor.” She whispered. 

“What?” As of today I couldn't tell you if I wanted to know what to do or if the thought just slipped my mind in surprise. 

“Do you want to really talk to me?” That's when the whisper became sweeter, more woman like. 

“Yes.” No hesitation, just pure curiosity.

“Tomorrow light a candle and leave it in the kitchen.” 

Full sentences were still out of reach for my sleeping mind, so I failed to ask what she meant, why light a candle or even what kind of candle. I ended up asking a friend at work, Laura, if she knew anything about candles. Dumb question, I know, but every time we spoke I noticed the different candles adorning her desk. 

“Well well well, a gift for a lady?” She teased.

I tried to explain it away, focusing on dumb things like how I just still didn’t feel at home, like if the scent of the previous owners still invaded the house. Now that I say it again I don’t know if I was really lying. 

Laura heard my explanation and handed me one of the candles from her desk, explained in detail its scent and how it would make the house fresher, but I don’t really remember much about that. 

I just went back home, lit the candle, left it on the kitchen counter and went to sleep. 

“Try talking to me.” 

“I can’t, it never works, you know it never works.” I said… thought. It doesn’t matter, finally I could express full thoughts without waking up. 

“You lit the candle, you obeyed.” 

That whisper, I feel like I can still hear it, really threw me off, For the first time I woke up late for work, ran to the kitchen and blew the candle off before leaving. When I returned I found the candle was just as it was when Laura gave it to me, even though it had been lit through the night. After that I avoided answering the whispers.

“Why won’t you talk to me anymore?” 

Without the candle I no longer felt like big sentences where possible, I thought I was safe.

“I mean no harm, I can prove it.” 

I was avoiding with all my might to answer, to give form to a thought that could be turned into a reply. Have you ever tried to stop talking to yourself?

“I’m not you. That I can prove too.” 

Remembering how it was at first, scary enough to be exiting, it makes me wonder if I would have done something different. The next day at work I went to Laura’s desk and asked her to write something inside a piece of paper without showing me. She laughed asking if it was some sort of magic trick and handed me a neatly folded paper. 

That night I lit the candle, and to make sure there was no way of somehow guessing what Laura wrote I left the piece of paper on my desk under my keyboard at work. 

“Goat.” 

“What do you mean?”

“If that’s what's in the paper, what will you give me Connor?”

I still felt like floating in my dream, but the warm cozy feeling froze all around me, I no longer was floating in warm nothingness, it felt as though I was encased in ice. 

“Invite her over.” She insisted.

At that point the dumb idea I had that I was just talking with myself, exploring my subconscious, just vanished, it no longer mattered what was written in the small piece of paper, but it was my last chance to write all of it off as recurrent nightmares and look for a psychiatrist.

The next day at work the first thing I did was to throw the folded piece of paper into the trash bin under my desk. Ready to try and forget it all, my sights already set on seeking help. 

“BAAAAAAAAAAH!” Laura belted out right behind me imitating a Goat. I almost fell from my chair. “HA! I knew you wouldn’t guess it.” She slapped my back and went back to her desk, laughing in victory. 

I wouldn’t count it as a scare, she surprised me, yes. But the real fear started taking root with the realization that grew as loud as her poor imitation of a goat, as I reached down into the small trash bin and took the paper out, unfolding it as I lifted it to my desk.

It wasn’t a word. She had drawn the face of a goat.
