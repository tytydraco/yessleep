# The Frequency from the Other Side

Absolute silence is a lie. If you go to a quiet enough place and clear your mind, you'll hear a buzzing — a noise that seems to come from inside your own skull; scientists call it white noise. I call it The Transmission. I moved to a wooden house in the north to escape the city and the end of my marriage, bringing only a few things: an old car, some suitcases, and my grandfather's shortwave amateur radio. He always carried a coiled wire in his pocket and had a finger scarred by solder burns; when he hugged me, he smelled of ozone. Before he died, he said only one thing, his eyes strangely empty: never tune to 44.4 Hz. I laughed and changed the subject. For the first few nights, the silence was almost comfortable, until a storm rolled in, the power went out, the pine trees slammed against the walls, and the radio turned on by itself.

Tick… tick… tick…

It wasn’t metallic; it sounded like teeth chattering. The dial glowed with a sickly orange light — 44.4 Hz — and the button was stuck, as if someone on the other end were holding it down. The voice that spilled from the speaker wasn’t human, just a jumble of overlapping whispers like crow wings beating over a cornfield. Elias. Hearing my name pulled me forward. The radio began to leak a black liquid that smelled of burnt flesh, the walls vibrating as the sound bypassed my ears and settled directly into my bones, as if a single note were dissolving my structure from the inside. In the window’s reflection I saw a figure in the corner of the room, almost three meters tall, thin as a wire, dressed in something that looked like old magnetic tape fused with dried skin, and where a face should have been there was a gramophone carved from bone. It didn’t move. It emitted. The sound carved my memory apart — not the good moments, only mistakes, fears, failures — and I saw my future rotting there, becoming furniture, my skin grafted to the wall while my consciousness was ground down by that frequency. I grabbed the axe and struck the radio. The glass shattered. The scream that came out wasn’t the creature’s. It was mine. I fell to my knees as my hands turned gray and crackled like television snow with no signal, and the Transmission Man tilted his bony head. He didn’t explain. He let me feel.

I woke on the living-room floor with the radio smashed and the storm gone, tried to speak and heard only static spill from my mouth, then stumbled into the car and drove toward the city. The closer I got to people, the louder the sound grew inside my head; a dog by the roadside began convulsing as I passed, blood leaking from its ears. It wasn’t a side effect. It was proximity contamination. The car radio — which had been off — switched on by itself, its display filling with jagged symbols like teeth as familiar voices rose from the interference: my mother, my ex-wife. I lost control and the car rolled, and I felt no pain. Beneath the torn skin of my chest, an amber light pulsed as my ribs opened to reveal copper wires sprouting like artificial veins. The landscape failed around me: pine trees stretched into metallic towers, the asphalt sagged like melted plastic, and a sign swayed on a pole made of spinal columns. There were others there, pale figures in rags with bone gramophones for mouths, walking in circles and transmitting a dissonant melody that kept that place standing. The Transmission Man appeared again, floating inches above the ground, silent, yet his presence made everything clear — wherever I went, the signal would follow. I wasn’t an accident. I was a piece.

They took me to a tower of bones and cables, where a radar dish skinned in human flesh turned slowly at the top. The wires found me, opened me without words, stretched me, bound me into the shape of a cross — flesh and metal, ritual and technology — and for a moment nothing happened. Then the light in my chest exploded and I saw fragments of everywhere: underground mines, endless labyrinths, plastic smiles in silent houses, all of it noise, all of it needing amplification. When the discharge left me, radios turned on by themselves in thousands of homes, televisions flickered, and people stopped mid-step to clutch their chests. It was quick. A tic. An emptiness. My consciousness shattered into channels and fused with the machine. I stopped being Elias. I became a pulse.

The world changed. The sky turned grainy like an image without signal, cities moved in synchronized waves, and when one trembled, all of them resonated. There were no secrets. There was no mourning. Only a sustained note. The Transmission Man watched for a moment, then dissolved into static. I don’t write this to threaten; even imprisoned, I still notice small things — an amber glow in a screen’s reflection, a faint tingling in the fingers of someone holding a device — small things that settle in before they’re noticed. The transmission ended for me. For the rest, it began. What remains of me is a pulse trapped in a core of bone, and if one day you feel, deep in your thoughts, a buzzing that isn’t yours — low, almost polite — don’t mistake it for tiredness. Don’t fight it. I’ve learned that trying to shut it off only increases the resonance. Here, all that continues is the ticking, an invisible cog, a clock without an owner. The silence that followed was profound, and inside it the frequency finally found space to breathe.

Tick… tick… tick…
