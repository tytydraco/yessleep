When i was younger i kept having this one recurring nightmare. I was watching a movie with my mum then there was an advert so we went to the dining room only to see my my aunt that we barely spoke to, her husband and kids. They were all sat around a big wooden table and they started talking about how everyone is and so on… from the corner of my eye i saw my step sister who is about 5 years younger than i am, in the kitchen hitting her head on the big glass door that leads to the garden. As her head kept hitting the doors it made very loud bangs. She slowly turned around and looked at me with a creepy grin on her face, blood started to pour out of her mouth and nose, but nobody seemed to see it just me. 
I hesitated whether i should approach her or not, but i told myself that she needed help. Slowly I started walking into the kitchen, as i got closer and closer i could hear her mumbling something under her breath only she wasn’t speaking English. I can’t describe what it sounded like but i sent shivers down my spine. 
When i tapped her on the back instantly it felt like someone grabbed me by my hair and threw me into the glass doors. Blood started dripping out of my nose. Whatever it was it was angry and it didn’t want me to help my stepsister. 
I felt a cold breeze on the back of my neck and i started levitating. The fear that went through my body was insane. It took me to the dining room where my family was and started spinning me around the table around everyone but they couldn’t see me, I tried to scream but it felt like someone had covered my mouth with their hand to stop me from screaming. I kept going faster and faster until it threw me against the wall.
 
Thinking it was all over, i woke up in another dream only to see a very larger, tall, dark figure standing in the corner of my room staring at me. I was paralysed with fear, i couldn’t move or talk. It looked like a demon that had red eyes and it smelled like sulphur. I couldn’t really see its face only his evil eyes and a terrifying grin that stretched from one ear to the other. He would slowly crawl towards my bed and i could just see his hunched over back and a strong smell of sulphur in the air, he would giggle while getting closer to me. Every night i would wake up from that horrible nightmare and see that thing in my room, each night getting closer and closer to me. One night i woke up from that nightmare to this one only this time he was hovering above me and his stick like fingers reached over to my face and started scratching me. I don’t remember anything after that but when i woke up in the morning i had three scratch marks on my face, and i never had a nightmare since.
