I just want to preface a few things about me, because I’m usually smarter than the actions I took within this progression of events. 

I’m a female van lifer who has been to Colorado more times than I can count, I’ve been to this specific campground more times than I can count, and I stayed in this specific lot more times than I can count. 

Each detail I’ve said has its part to play in my rationale. 

I drove the full 500 mile stretch between Springville, Utah and Allenspark, Colorado only stopping to get gas. It was fairly routine at this point. However, one thing I often failed to plan was when to leave places so I could arrive at my destination at an appropriate time. 

If a museum or roadside attraction caught my eye, I’d stop. If I struck up a conversation with someone, I’d yap endlessly. If I was tired before even leaving, I’d sleep in. 

The latter of the three was the reason why I chose to embark on that eight hour drive at noon. 

That put me arriving in Allenspark at 8:30 PM.

It was fall, so the sun had set a while ago. 

I was bleary eyed when the light of the pay booth cracked between the trees. Relieved to see it, I cut my vehicle to the left so I could reach the ticket dispenser and input my code. Surprisingly, however, there was someone manning the booth this time. 

A portly older man greeted me, a bushy mustache hiding a thin smile. 

“Class B RV mini campervan, lot 25? Was wondering when you’d show.” 
He cracked, looking at his computer screen. 

He probably knew it was me cause I was among the last that showed up for their reservation. 

He issued me a ticket to put in my dash before giving the perfunctory briefing about the bear boxes and the prevalence of mountain lions. 

“I can check your lot before you park if you’d like.” 

I don’t know why I told him no. 

I pulled forward, RVs go 1 mile uphill to the left and cyclists and pedestrians go to the right. I felt adventurous, though and knew the place well enough. I knew a few spots further up that they only use whenever the main RV area gets overbooked. It’s about three miles from the pay booth. 

I arrived at my unofficial lot and began to prepare my vehicle. If I had arrived during the day (and opted for the main lot) my ritual would’ve been to set up my outdoor camera, see who was in the other lots around me, and overall check my surroundings before plugging in my Noco boost in case my solar batteries were in over discharge.  

However, I don’t have the safety of the sunlight on my side anymore. No one of any gender or stature should arrive at campsites alone at night, but certainly not solo female travelers. 

Everything that would keep me safe was inside the van, so inside the van is where I would stay. I put up my window covers, leaving one window open, as that was the window that I’d vent my portable AC out of. It didn’t worry me too much because I had a custom built window insert that was a black panel with cutouts for two exhaust fans so I can have a “closed window” while still venting my AC. 

I plugged my AC into my interior DC outlets and pulled out my laptop. I was exhausted, but I couldn’t allow myself to sleep. Bad habit. 

Despite the fatigue of arriving late, I was in the mood to trip. I had psychedelic mushroom gummies on hand, those legal ones, not the psilocybin ones. I took two, an amount inconsequential to me, but still enough to alter a few things about my world. 

About five hours into the night, the colors violently erupted into my vision saturating the Supernatural episode I was watching into a strange color spectrum. All the silhouettes of every object was lined in yellow, blue, and red as if everything was being refracted through a prism. Moving bodies left an after image in the shape that their bodies took in the frame before. I could hear every noise and every noise sounded slow, but clear.

 I hear a stirring outside my vehicle. Immediately, a state of unease overtook me. Only when I muted my laptop, did the sound graduate into a rustling then a full on thrashing. Branches fell, some of which being onto the hood of my vehicle. I cursed. Grabbing my keys, so that I could turn on the headlights and assess the damage from inside the vehicle. 

I pulled the curtain between the rest of my vehicle and the cab and got in the front seat. 
Sure enough, a tree limb landed on my hood, but there seemed to be no denting. 

There was also a slightly foul smell that befell my surroundings. I took note, but It didn’t detract me from remaining here. 

Relieved that there was no damage to my vehicle, I resumed to business as usual. It wasn’t fifteen minutes later when a violent resounding thud erupted onto the roof of my van. The whole van shook and my lights flickered. My heart thumped an arrhythmic pattern. The sheer magnitude of the sound was along the lines of when a jolt of thunder pulls you out of your sleep and you wake up sweaty and confused. 

Minutes of silence filled the air while I caught my breath.  The air that filled my lungs was sour and tasted of rot. More of that foul air seemed to be rushing into my van and affecting my senses like a miasmic plague. I rushed to close the regular van windows over my exhaust fans, putting my shirt over my nose to shield me from the smell. 

In my altered shroom induced state, the smell brought upon visions of speckled black dots. They looked like fissures forming on blackened rotted flesh.

Through the curtain separating the front of my vehicle from the back, I could see faintly the silhouette of a vulture pulling at an indistinguishable pile of viscera. It’s talons tapped on my dashboard as it tries to gain its footing to tear a piece of flesh. 

Panicked, I switch on my headlights to see that all I was actually seeing was the silhouette of the branch that had fallen on my vehicle earlier A gust of wind was knocking it against my dashboard. My eyes are playing tricks on me. 

At this point, the self awareness that I was tripping out of my mind brought me comfort. That and the knowledge of the 9 millimeter that I kept strapped behind the passenger seat. 

I remembered the park ranger’s warning about the mountain lions and a sudden revelation came down on me like a pile of bricks. 

Mountain lions store their prey in trees sometimes. A deer fell out of a tree onto my roof. That’s all. 

The thought sickened me. 

Not only because there was a mountain lion near, but because there was a rotting thing over me right now. 

I turn on my interior lights, my roof is sagging from the force the deer exerted when it fell on my roof. 

My hands shaking and my eyes full of tears, I contact the park service, hoping desperately that they have 24/7 rangers.

A familiar voice picked up the phone. It’s the attendee that that let me in earlier.

“If I don’t make sense, it’s because I’m tripping really bad right now, but I think a mountain lion put a deer in a tree and it just fell on my van. You gotta help me. I’m seeing visions of whack stuff and I need someone to come help me. Please. I’m not in lot 25 like I should be, I’m on the upper site. In the first section. It’s the unmarked one, but it’s right next to the path. You gotta help me.” 

My head was swimming and the contents of my stomach threatened to eject themselves. I’ve dealt with dead things, rotting things before. I’ve taken bones from roadkill, but this felt different. I don’t know if it was because I was tripping, but something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

The sound of something rolling off the roof and sliding down the side of my van brought me out of my thoughts. It sounded like metal against metal, clear as day. I cautiously parted the window cover on the side that it fell. I shined my tact light out the window and there lying on the ground was a flashlight. 

My stomach fell. 

The next few moments passed like a decaying VHS tape played at half speed. Time was slow for me right now. Blinking felt like temporary breaks from the reality unfolding in front of me, so I blinked and blinked until reality left me completely. 

Terrified shrieks of horror jolted me out of my anxiety induced semi-conscious stupor, followed by the unmistakable sound of retching. 

I moved my window covers aside to see the ranger and his partner twenty feet away from my vehicle, staring at the space above me. One sprinted toward my vehicle and attempted to throw open the door. 

“God, please open the door.”
He half whined, half screamed, half cursed as he yanked at the handle repeatedly. 

I unlocked the door, the ranger throwing it open and practically yanking me out. 

I attempted to look back, but he tore me away before I could fulfill my attempt and loaded me into his vehicle. 

His partner, who had refused to come any closer got into the passenger side. His face was pallid and terror stricken. 

“Was—“
I swallowed.

Instead of asking the dreadful question, I opted to look back at my abandoned van to see what was unmistakably a the placid corpse of a man in a neon windbreaker. His head was twisted impossibly, hanging over the side of my solar panel. Unblinking eyes stared after us.
