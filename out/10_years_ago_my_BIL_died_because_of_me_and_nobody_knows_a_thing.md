This is something that has haunted me for a really long time now. I was really close to my brother in law. Even before my wife and I got married, I had helped him out with the SAT, and we regularly played GTA together. I always thought he was a pretty cool dude, and he was kind of a real brother to me in some ways.

For his 18th birthday, his parents had bought him a car, and it was up to my wife and I to plan the party and finally surprise him with it. I let his dad park their car at my place, so that the garage could be cleared out. I parked the car in the garage, but absentmindedly, I left the car on. It was a poorly ventilated area with a running car in it...

The day started off great, we had breakfast with my BIL at his favourite waffle place. I gifted him a copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Playstation 4 he had just gotten with his part time job money. His friends soon arrived and the party got kicked off.
The party was going pretty well for the most part, we were all having fun, and then we heard the smoke alarm. I ran to get BIL out of the bedroom where he was changing, but suddenly, someone dropped the cupboard in front of the door. I started freaking out and then he just held me. He told me, "I've been waiting to turn 18 for a long time" and tried to undress me. I realised that I might just DIE, and accepted it.

He was thrusting into my ass, the asphyxiation made it more erotic. Then suddenly, he hit a haemmorhoid. It popped and the pain made me clench HARD. He was pulling out and suddenly degloved his penis and fell over from the pain, in a pool of his own blood. I took the skin out of my ass, put my clothes back on, pocketed the skin. I got an adrenaline rush that allowed me to get out of the room by pushing the cupboard. I thought about carrying him out, but I'd pass out, and the whole world would know what we did. IO made the fucking selfish decision to leave him to asphyxiate or bleed to death, or get infected. Part of me hoped they'd find him alive but brain damaged enough to forget. But that wasn't in his fate. He died.

I spent a few days in the nearby fields, pretending I was lost and confused from the CO poisoning. When they found me, I was "shocked" to learn that my BIL was dead, or that his penis had been skinned. They all thought that I was hurt, scared. I still held on to the skin that was sitting around in my pocket. I was horrified.

I've kept this secret from my wife for 10 years now, and it eats me up inside every time his birthday/deathday comes around, or when I get pegged, or when I see the bunched up skin, hidden away in my private diary in which I write with my blood.
