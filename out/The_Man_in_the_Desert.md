I've been driving trucks for the past 15 years, and in that time, I've seen my fair share of strange things. But I will never forget that one night in 2017.

I was driving through the Mojave Desert in California, heading toward Arizona. I can't remember exactly what I was delivering—probably some appliances. It was nighttime, and the darkness was so thick that the only light came from my headlights. Normally, I didn’t mind my dim lights, but that night, with no other vehicles in sight, I realized I should have replaced them.

I had to strain my eyes just to see the road. Every few minutes, I considered pulling over and waiting for daylight, but I didn’t want to waste time. I was already short on money, so I figured I’d keep going. After all, it was a straight road.

There was about an hour left until sunrise when I spotted something ahead—something lying in the middle of the road, slowly moving toward me.

I panicked, thinking it might be an animal, so I slammed on the brakes. As the truck came to a stop, my headlights revealed something truly bizarre.

A red Ford Fusion. Hazard lights blinking. Parked right in the middle of the road, as if someone had deliberately placed it there.

And the strangest part? The passenger-side door was wide open.

Now, I’m not easily scared. I’ve been in my fair share of fights and dealt with plenty of situations in trucking. So instead of feeling afraid, I just found it... odd.

I figured maybe someone needed help. Maybe their battery had died, or they ran out of gas.

I reversed my truck a little and parked it on the side. I thought about lighting flares, but I hadn’t seen a single car all night, so I didn’t bother.

When I stepped out, I realized just how unnervingly quiet it was. No wind. No distant hum. Just dead silence—except for the rhythmic clicking of the car’s hazard lights.

As I got closer, I noticed the car looked brand new. I peered inside.

No one. Not in the driver’s seat. Not in the back seat.

My curiosity quickly turned into unease. If someone needed help, they’d still be around. And if they had abandoned the car, why would they leave the door open?

I looked around. Nothing. Just desert, darkness, and silence.

I pulled out my flashlight and scanned the area, but all I could see was emptiness. Still, I decided to check for clues.

The car seemed perfectly fine. Keys were still in the ignition, but the engine was off.

I walked around to the trunk and tried to open it.

Locked.

I grabbed the keys and unlocked it.

Still wouldn’t open.

Something was jammed inside.

I went back to the back seat, pulled it forward, and reached through to open the trunk.

It worked.

Inside were three large black plastic bags. A thick rope was tied around them, keeping the trunk shut.

I glanced over my shoulder once more.

By now, the atmosphere was starting to feel genuinely sinister.

Still, I reached out to touch one of the bags—

BANG.

The sound was so loud that my ears started ringing.

I slammed my head against the truck’s roof in shock. Without thinking, I tossed the keys onto the seat and sprinted toward my truck.

That’s when I heard a voice in the darkness.

“Hey! Hey! Stop!”

The voice grew louder. Closer.

I jumped into my truck, started it up, threw it into gear—

The engine stalled.

And that’s when I saw him.

He was standing by the car’s trunk.

A short, stocky man with scraggly red hair. Overalls and knee-high boots.

In his left hand, he held a small shovel. In his right hand, a worn-out hunting rifle.

Our eyes met.

He just stood there, staring at me.

No crazed expression. No anger. If anything... he looked worried.

As my truck finally rolled forward, he dropped the shovel and began waving his arms.

He started shouting.

“Wait! Stop! Listen!”

But there was no way I was stopping.

In the rearview mirror, I saw him run for a few seconds—then suddenly turn and dash back toward the car.

I floored it, speeding up as fast as the truck could go.

Just as I thought I was finally safe—

Bright headlights lit up behind me.

The Ford Fusion was coming straight for me.

At full speed.

For the first time in my life, I genuinely thought I was going to die.

I called the police as quickly as I could, breathless, explaining what was happening.

The car behind me blared its horn, tailgating dangerously close.

For fifteen agonizing minutes, I drove as fast as I could.

Then, finally 

Flashing police lights appeared ahead.

The Ford Fusion suddenly swerved to the right, veering straight off the road into the desert.

I pulled over as soon as I reached the officers and told them everything.

But instead of chasing the car, they just started taking my statement.

I begged them twice to go after the vehicle.

But they kept telling me to calm down and stay put.

Then, one officer said, We’ll do a thorough search operation. Don’t worry.

And that was it.

I never heard back. No calls. No updates.

A lot of my friends have seen creepy things out on the road. But no matter how many times I’ve told this story, it only raises more questions.

Maybe he was trying to bury something.

But why such a small shovel?

And why was he so desperate to stop me?

There was no way bodies could fit in those plastic bags.

So what the hell was in there?

Even today, whenever I drive through the desert at night, I can’t help but wonder...

If I hadn’t had my truck that night—

Would I have made it out alive?
