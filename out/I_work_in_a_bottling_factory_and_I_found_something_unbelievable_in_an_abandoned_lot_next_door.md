By all rights, it should've been your typical Wednesday evening. I’d just clocked off and I was homeward bound. I'd been working at the bottleyard for the past seven years and every day was always the same as the one that came before it. Apart from *that* Wednesday.

I'd decided I'd take a shortcut through the abandoned lot next door. It's been empty for at least a decade. Sometimes junkies used it as a discrete spot to shoot smack undisturbed, but since they put up the cameras and the metal sheets in the windows, it's a lot more quiet.

As I was walking passed a skip filled with debris, I heard a strange rattling sound from inside of it, like some kinda creature trapped underneath the trash. I stopped. I've got a great sympathy for animals, I've always found them a lot kinder and easier to understand than people. So, I made my way over to see if I could be of any assistance.

Lifting up a rusted piece of corrugated iron, I saw it, and I'll never forget it, not as long as I live.

There, lying in amongst the scrap, was a severed arm.

I recoiled immediately. I did not fancy getting involved. No thank you. That was certainly a human arm, a blind man could've spotted it a mile off. A stump, a hand and fingers, all 5 of them. Clean too, which was surprising considering it was in the trash, and probably used to belong to some smack head who forgot to pay up.

Then it twitched.

I saw the fingers curl, moving with intention. It was trying to make symbols and shapes. It was trying to communicate.

Standing there, in my Cat work boots, rooted to the ground in shock, I recalled something. I'd taken an extra college class in sign language, way back, and some of the symbols it was making seemed *pretty* familiar. So, I looked harder, and I tried to translate what the arm was saying.

The signs were jerky and sloppy, it had clearly sustained some damage in the severing. But it was easy enough for me to make out the few words it was repeating.

"Help," "me," and "please".

I was totally lost for what to do next. There I was, utterly alone, in an abandoned smack head hangout, with a severed arm that was trying to converse with me in standard British Sign Language.

This is something else, I thought, this is really something else. And, I'm ashamed to admit, I also thought about running, and ignoring its messages completely. But I stayed, and I took a step forward, knelt beside it, and tried to talk to it.

"What's wrong?" I signed back, "Who are you? How did this happen to you?" Stupid I know, and of course, the arm didn't respond. How could it? It was just an arm, it couldn't *see* me.

It just kept signing the same thing over, and over again. "Help me. Help me. Help me."

Jesus, I didn't know what to do with the thing. But I did know that I couldn't just leave the poor arm out there in a skip.

So, I did the only thing I could think to do. I picked it up, I wrapped it in my jacket and I cradled it in my arms like a baby. I could feel it panic and twist, squirming and fighting against my hold. But, as I began to rock it back and forth, it started to calm down a little.

I couldn't stay here, so I walked towards my house. As I walked, I noticed the arm was trying to sign again, not that I was paying too much attention, my focus was mainly trained more on making sure no one saw me with a disembodied limb.

I was almost home when I noticed the arm'd started behaving a little differently. The fingers had curled up, and in the centre of its palm, small red bumps were pushing their way through the skin. They just kept coming, more and more of them, until they'd created a raised surface with a little gap in the middle.

"Jesus christ!" I whispered to it. "Are you alright? What the hell's happening to you?" I knew the arm couldn't hear me, but I couldn't help talking to it.

The raised spotty patches kept pushing themselves up further, making the gap in the centre of the palm even more pronounced. Then the spotty surface pushed itself too far, and tore a gaping hole right in the middle of the palm.

“Christ alive!” I said, “what, are you giving birth?”

On closer inspection, I saw it had formed itself a rudimentary pair of lips.

I had stopped dead in my tracks, and was now staring down at the arm, my own mouth hanging open in shock.

Then the lips began to move, and a voice tumbled out, high and raspy.

"Please," it said, "Help me. Please."

"Help you? How? Jesus wept, how can I help? Please, tell me how!"

The arm and its newly acquired lips, did not answer. It simply repeated itself, over and over, becoming more agitated and loud with each cycle. "Help me. Please help me."

"Please," it said, louder still

"Help me. Please." the words became less important than the volume, it was almost shouting now.

"Please," it screamed, "Please, HELP ME! PLEASE!"

And then, it dispensed with words entirely, and started shrieking like a banshee.

This was bad.

This was gonna draw some attention that I did not want. How would I explain why I was walking round with a screaming severed arm.

I didn't want any trouble. So, I shoved the sleeve of my jacket over its mouth and pressed the fabric down inside with my fingers, muting its cries.

And it bit me.

The damn thing had teeth, and it bit me with them, and in my pain I wanted to scream too.

I ran the rest of the way back home, holding the cloth inside of its mouth, and all the while it was still biting down on my hand. I must've looked crazy, but I don't think anyone saw or heard me.

When I got home, I put the disembodied arm down on the table. And, just for a second, I removed the jacket sleeve from its mouth. It started screaming again instantly. Hastily I shoved the fabric right back between its lips. this time I wrapped it up completely, and bound the fabric fixed in place with some elastic bands and string. It worked much better than my fingers, but I could still hear it, a little.

The next few days went by in a blur. From that point on, I always took the long way home from work. And, when I got back inside, and I felt I wanted to have a drink to unwind, I would open the fridge.

Inside, between the condiments, the beers and the half-empty takeout boxes; wriggling and softly screaming into its fabric muffler. The arm.

Just yesterday, I noticed new bumps appearing on it, in the shape of an ear.

I haven’t got a clue what to do with it, but I know I can't keep it here.
