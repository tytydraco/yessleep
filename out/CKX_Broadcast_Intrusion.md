CKX Broadcast Intrusion

For a brief period in 1987 I worked as a technician for a television station called CKX-TV in Manitoba. The channel mostly just aired CBC content like Sesame Street, Anne of Green Gables, Babar, and other children shows. At least that’s what they usually aired in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, I didn’t work at night. 

There was this show called “Not my Department” It was this shitty sitcom about civil servants, it honestly sucked and I don’t recommend anyone watching it. Anyways, it was a late afternoon in November and I was getting ready to leave when some girl working at the station ran up to me as I was putting my mucks on and urged me to go see what was currently being transmitted. I sighed and walked through the hallways of the station and looked at the first television set I saw.

It was just an average episode of Not my Department and I almost started to chuckle when I saw it, a quick haze of static appeared and slowly dissipated. as the broadcast came back into view it was clear something was off. A man standing in a dim, filthy, garage stood directly in front of the camera. We could only see a bit of his chin as the camera was pointed at his body. He wore a brown jacket and white shirt. Both were very dirty and his faded jeans were dirty too. 

He moved off screen for a moment and came back with a small piece of paper in his hands, he held the paper up to the camera, it was faded and had a yellow tint to it.

He stood frozen for a few seconds, just holding the paper in front of the camera. After about a minute I could see drops of water falling onto his shirt. About five minutes in he started shaking and whimpering. I just stood in silence with the girl, we both were just in complete shock. The man suddenly moved to the left side of the screen and the screen flashed white three times as three loud bangs were heard. The man slumped down into the corner of the room. it was hard to see him after that because of how dark the room was. The camera started to shake as the camera turned to the right of the room. A chalkboard with the number 8 faced the camera. A black glove came into frame and rubbed the 8 off the board. It then picked up a piece of chalk and wrote the number 9. 

55.03463° N, 97.33854° W

That’s what the paper read. I’ve been to those coordinates, I went with a couple of coworkers a few days after it happened. I’m making this info public because I can’t stand this guilt eating away at me anymore.

We had a copy of the incident on VHS, and I watch it regularly with tears in my eyes. Because I know that the number is higher then 9. I know because after a few years my past coworkers from the station started to go missing. 

as far as I know this is the first public account of the CKX broadcast intrusion.
