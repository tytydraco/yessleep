Ok guys, I'm officially scared and don't know what else to do or who to turn to. Long story short, let me just ask if everyone here is familiar with "numbers stations"?

Well for those that don't, briefly, they’re weird shortwave radio broadcasts--just roboticish voices reading strings of numbers and sometimes letters. No explanation. No station ID. Just:

“Four. Seven. Two. One.” Repeat.

They’ve existed since the Cold War and some say they’re spy transmissions. Others think it’s something worse. Thing is, some are still broadcasting, and a few didn’t seem to have a source. 

Or so I thought.

Now my background, I used to work overnights at a tiny FM radio station in Pennsylvania—WQRC 98.7. Graveyard shift. We were a Class A station, running mostly automated playlists, but I’d be there to log weather carts, cue PSAs, and hit the liners every hour.

Most nights, it was just me, the board, and a crusty old pot of gas station coffee.

One night, bored out of my mind, I started playing around with our Kenwood R-5000 receiver. It's an old shortwave radio with manual tuning, and sometimes I’d just scroll through the bands to see what odd stuff was floating through the ether.

That’s when I found it—14225 kHz.

No call sign. No station ID. Just this flat, robotic little girl’s voice reading numbers:

“Nine. Four. Zero. One. Seven. Zero.”

Then a pause.

Then this awful clicking sound—wet and erratic. Like keys on glass or something. Then silence.

I thought I just stumbled upon another old numbers station, but this one felt (the only way I know how to describe it)... wrong. A literal, emotional, spiritual feeling? Hell I don't know, but I didn’t *feel* like it was broadcasting. I felt like it was listening.

I recorded it straight into Adobe Audition from the monitor output on the board and played it back three times through the studio monitors. Every single time, something weird happened.

The Orban processor flickered. The silence monitor tripped. The lights buzzed. I swear I heard breathing behind me.

I told Mitch, our weekend weather guy and part-time engineer. He laughed, until I played it for him.

Then he went pale.

“I used to hear that broadcast as a kid,” he said. “Not on a radio though. Through my bedroom wall.”

The following Monday, we got a package in the station dropbox. No return address. Just six numbers on a scrap of paper:

940170

Inside: a VHS tape.

It showed grainy, black-and-white footage of the station. Filmed from across the road. The camera zoomed in on the studio window. On me, sitting at the board.

The timestamp? Three days from now.

At exactly 2:37 a.m., the power goes out in the footage. I stand up suddenly—like something yanks me upward off my seat. Then: static.

We thought it was a prank.

Until that Friday. At exactly 2:37 a.m., the power actually cut out. The UPS kicked in. The transmitter stayed live, but the console died for twelve seconds.

And something cold grabbed my neck.

I checked the next morning. Bruises. Five, scrawny, finger-shaped marks. Like something had grabbed me with wires made of ice.

Every Monday, another package, another tape.
Each one showed something that hadn’t happened yet, and each one came true.

Janelle, our traffic anchor, vanished during a live break. Just like the tape. Her car was found at a rest stop, still idling. No trace of her in the system. No lease. No pay stubs. Even our ENCO playout logs were wiped clean—like she’d never recorded a single cart.

With some much needed advice and help from a few others, I attempted to see if there were patterns to the numbers. I couldn't believe it! We found that some were coordinates, others pointed to military facilities and old decommissioned towers. One pointed directly to our STL dish. But another? My own home address.

After this, the broadcast on 14225 changed.

It wasn’t the little girl’s voice anymore.

It was Mitch’s, then Janelle's.

Then it was mine.

“You are now a relay station. Repeat. You are now... a relay station.”

Desperately seeking answers, I found an old Usenet thread from 1998, buried in a conspiracy archive. Someone posted about something called The Glass Frequency and said it was a signal that didn’t just transmit information—it transmitted you. 

The final line in the thread said:

“If you hear yourself, you are no longer you."

WQRC signed off in 2021. Official cause: a lightning strike took out our STL path. The FCC listed it as a silent station.

Since then, I've been tuning into 14225 online and as I said above, I'm scared and need help. 

Why? 

Last night  I tuned into 14225 and now I know I don’t have much time. Listening to yourself tell you: "Zero. Zero. One. You are next” psychologically destroys you. Please. If anyone has any helpful information,  or have heard of anything else like this, you know what to do.
