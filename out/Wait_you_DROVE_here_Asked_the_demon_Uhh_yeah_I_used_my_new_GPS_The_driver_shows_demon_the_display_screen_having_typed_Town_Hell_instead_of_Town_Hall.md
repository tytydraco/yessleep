"Wait.... what app are you using?"

"It's called.... maponomicon. A buddy recommended it. Said it gives the best detours of any map app."The demon, Gordon, rolled his eyes. "Wait, the way in here looks like solid rock. What the fuck made you think driving into solid rock was a good idea?"

"It didn't look like solid rock, it looked like a tunnel."

"A what? Just a fucking second..." And then Gordon seemed to vanish right before Dylan's eyes. A second later he was back as though he had never left.

"How did you DO that!?"

"Shut up," Gordon said dismissively. "There's only one asshole down here who has gotten into using human tech and would do that to the portal," he said, more to himself than to Dylan.

"Wait, where am I?"

Gordon gave his attention back to Dylan. "You're in hell, broadly speaking. This is the area of hell that is connected to the state of Arizona, Phoenix chapter."

"That explains why I didn't notice I was in hell until it was too late. Same diff."

Gordon gave a slight smirk of amusement at the burn, but then returned to his stoic nature and said again, "Shut up." He then placed his finger to his throat and his voice seemed to boom from all around. Gordon shrank slightly at the volume. "Devest get your ass over here right now and explain this shit."

"Wait, does that mean I'm dead?"

"Dead? Do you remember dying? Do you feel dead? No you fucking idiot, you just slipped through a portal that connects the surface to hell."

"But I thought hell was a place you go when you die if you're bad."

"Do you see any other humans roaming about here? That's just bullshit that was created by humans who accidentally happened upon portals and ended up down here. This is just as much a part of Earth as where you're from."

"Does that mean there's also no God?"

"We know about as much about that as you do, man. Maybe? Who knows."

"But you're like... magical and shit, how do you not know?"

"Magical? You sound about as evolved as the humans that were coming down here hundreds of years ago. We just know more than you. This is why we don't want you fuckers coming down here on your own. We wouldn't want you learning too much now, would we?" A wicked glint shined in Gordon's eyes.

"Wh-" Dylan started to speak, but just then another demon appeared next to Gordon.

"You called, Gordon?" Devest said with the tone of one who had been severely inconvenienced. But then, noticing Dylan, he perked up instantly. "Sweet! It worked!"

"What worked? WHAT FUCKING WORKED DEVEST?" Gordon was clearly running out of patience."I ordered takeout. Hahahah..." Devest was doubled over laughing at his own joke while Gordon scowled at him and Dylan stood looking between the two, totally nonplussed.

"Explain better," Gordon growled. "Start with what you did to the fucking portal."

Devest composed himself so he could speak again, but he didn't lose any of his amusement. "Alright, alright. Humans are dumb, but they're not gonna drive into rock walls. I took a cue from their cartoons and painted a very realistic tunnel on the rock. Hoisted by their own petard you might say." He stood proudly, smirking.

"And what," Gordon's voice lowered to a hiss in his anger, "is the maponomicon?"

"Hahaha... Isn't that the best fucking name ever? Hidden in plain sight, man. It's my new app! Not up on any stores yet, but that's the goal. Right now it's just downloadable off my very sketchy looking website. Anyone who actually downloads and uses that thing deserves to find his way down here. Hahaha..." Devest seemed completely unconcerned by Gordon's increasing anger.

"What the fuck are you doing?! You know we can't just have humans coming down here whenever they want with no control over when they come, or more importantly GO!" Gordon shouted.

"Dude, do you think they're going to be able to find the way out on their own? No way man. It's not the place they land and it's not painted like a big fucking target."

"But WHY??"

"I told you... takeout." And now his amused, cocky face turned to something more menacing... almost hungry.

They both looked over at Dylan, who went from being curious and overwhelmed to fearful at the look on Devest's face. Trembling and with trepidation he says, "Sorry guys, I didn't bring any food with me."Gordon looks at Devest and says, "You know how fast these kinds of things can spread. It's not a bad idea in theory, but your execution was careless. Take it down, and we'll refine this plan later. For now..." he turned and placidly looked at Dylan, "How would you like to join us for dinner?"

"Um... what's on the menu?" Dylan tried to sound calm, but a crack in his voice betrayed him.

"Well you see, the hell stories you've heard do have some truth to them. You don't end up here when you die, but what happens to you when you're here is probably not pleasant... for you. You see, tonight's menu has changed. It just so happens that tonight, it's you."

And with the most malicious grin he'd ever seen before him, Dylan was hit over the head, and saw no more.
