Growing up in Vermont is not the most exciting thing in the world. I grew up in Stowe, it’s a small town with “a lot of charm”. Basically unless you live there it’s a rotating door of tourists which is pretty annoying especially in the fall/winter. It hoards a lot of mountains and getting lost is extremely common. Since it was just me, my mom and sister we spent a lot of time at my grandparents house, which to be honest as a kid sucked. They lived in this old colonial in the mountains which means cell service sucked, wifi was always spotty and riding my bike into town was impossible because they lived in the middle of nowhere.

I will never forget the spring of 2004. I was 14 and my sister was 5. My grandparents were getting fed up with the two of us staying inside all day. My grandfather came into my room an told me it’s not healthy staying inside all day and instructed me to take my sister outside and go play. Of course being a teenager I rolled my eyes an said well theirs nothing to do outside and I don’t want to be a babysitter. He did not take that well. Grandpa suggested that I take my sister Lilly on a hike since I’m always roaming around the woods. As a side note the only reason I would go into the woods was to get a good signal to call my friends. 

I knew those woods like the back of my hand. My dad an I would always go on hikes before he died. The trails were easy to navigate so I just decided instead of getting into an argument I would take Lilly into the woods and explore for 30 minutes so they can get off of my back. 

Lilly was so excited, I went downstairs and she had her backpack ready and we were off. The woods were extremely beautiful and walking with Lilly gave me flashbacks of when me and dad would go hiking. My grandparents offered us to take Diego their German Shepherd with us but I was over this whole ordeal an waved that suggestion off. I mean looking after a dog and Lilly in the woods was way to inconvenient for my sassy teenage self.  Somehow after 20 minutes of sulking and not paying attention I realized we had veered off of the trail.

At this moment my dumb teenage ass regretted not bringing Diego. He always went hunting with my grandpa and knew these woods very well. After walking around for an hour I started to go into panic mode. I told myself “ok do not look worried, if I do then Lilly will start to worry I can do this”. To my surprise Lilly brought a compass with her. I thought good job genius, at least we can finally get out of here. The only thing was when I took the compass from my sister it looked like it was going crazy. It was an electric one, when I looked at it the digital numbers were going bananas and everywhere we walked it stayed at South East. That pissed me off because after my moment of relief the damn compass was fried.

Eventually which felt like hours we found this strange clearing. It was a huge circular field surrounded by flowers. In the background stood an old disheveled house. That’s not the part that scared me, what did was the smoke pouring out of the chimney. I started to turn around but Lilly was gone. I saw her running in the field towards the house. Once she got to the door she innocently tried to knock on it but before she could the door opened. A young woman who seemed like she was around the age of 25 came outside. Lilly started talking to her and I don’t know what she said but when I got to the door the women had already invited us inside. We’re going to die, we’re going to die, we’re lost and no one is going to find our bodies, why the fuck didn’t I bring Diego was all that was running through my mind. 

The house was odd, it looked much bigger on the inside it had an upstairs and a basement. This didn’t make sense because the house from outside showed no indication of a second floor and where did this basement come from? Oh yeah that’s the basement where we’re going to die in, good job for not paying attention. I can see it now teenage girl an sister go missing because teenager failed to give a shit about anything but herself.

The young woman was making soup and decided that we looked rough and needed to eat. Sitting across from the woman all I could do was stare at her. She was beautiful. Ocean blue eyes, long brown hair her skin was perfect in a China doll way. Her lips looked like God had painted them on. Then she started asking questions. First our names, I was hesitant but Lilly said “ hi my name is Lilly I’m 5 years old, this is my sister Rose she is 14 and really crabby”. This was embarrassing, the woman introduced herself as May. It made sense because that name fit her perfectly. She loved the fact we had flower names. I told her I was named after my grandmother and my parents just went with the flower theme. 

May started asking us weird questions. Then she said “I am going to ask each of you 3 questions, please answer them honestly”. Ok weird I thought but we’re lost with a strange woman so just go with the flow so she can tell us how to get out of here. She asked Lilly “what do you want to be when you grow up”?. I want to be um well I guess a dentist! I love to smile and a dentist is what my best friends mom is! She replied. Ok Lilly “what is something you really want?” Was the second question. Um I really want a horse my friends have horses an they even get to ride them! My mom says I can’t ride a horse because we don’t have enough money. The last question she asked Lilly was “if you could live in any country which one would you choose?”. Oh I would totally live in Germany they have good food and I love pretzels! Strange answer I thought but she’s 5.

Now it was my turn, I thought of all the questions she asked Lilly so I was prepared. She looked at me in a stern but fragile way. The first question she asked me was different, she asked “what is the one thing I miss the most in this world”? I was taken aback by it but I knew what I missed the most. I told her my dad he’s the one thing I miss the most. I think because I was older my questions were not as I guess “kid friendly”. Next thing she asks “do you want to be smart or popular?”. That question was so random I told her I would rather be smart because people today suck. The last question she asked was “what’s your favorite thing to eat?”. I told her I would love to have my dads famous risotto again.

After the questions I politely asked if their is a way out of the woods, she simply said it is right through the bushes you can’t miss it but before you go I want to give you guys something. She had given me a red rose and a Lilly well a Lilly. I thought ok that’s pretty cute. We exited the house an I asked “will we ever see you again?” She responded “after today I can see you but you won’t see me, I have one request you must forget you were here, I’m not worried about your sister because she is young but you, I give you this warning for if anyone finds out about this you will be one of my flowers”. That scared the hell out of me so I ran. After we got through the bushes I noticed my grandparents house. What in the fuck?? No we were not this close to home, I turn around to get Lilly and the field had disappeared.

I could not stop thinking about May and the warning she gave me, but whatever I’m home now. When we got into the house my mom and grandparents were in a frenzy. “Where we’re you! We have been looking for you for hours!”. She told my grandma to call Dan and tell him the kids are safe. I almost dropped dead in my tracks, my blood had drained from my body, I was frozen. The front door opens and it was my dad his name is Dan. “Where in the hell were you??” He asked, all I could do was stand there thinking this is not real you are not here I’m losing my mind. Lilly paid no attention to it an ran into my dads arms shouting Daddy!!” Like she had just seen him a few hours ago. The ride home was strange, we were going a different way and pulled into a strange driveway. This is not my house we do not live in a 2 story modern colonial near town and why in the hell do I see stables? I didn’t want to say anything and just went with this new universe I’m living in.

Lilly asks my dad if she can ride her horse Cody. What in the fuck is a Cody I thought? My dad told her no because he’s making risotto. That made my soul leave my body. While sitting at the dinner table still looking pale and trying to process what’s happening my mom asks “so did you write your speech yet?”. Clueless me replies what speech are you talking about? Lilly laughs an says your smart person speech. What the fuck is a smart person speech? My dad chimes in “Rose you worked so hard, your valedictorian speech, duh! You only graduate 8th grade once dear”. Valedictorian? Me huh yeah right I’m on academic probation. Then I remembered the question May asked me the smart or popular question, my eyeballs almost popped out of my head.

Still confused, me and Lilly were at our grandparents again while our parents were at work. My friend Sarah who my grandparents don’t approve of came over. She lives right down the road and I wanted to hang out. We did the usual hang out, gossip but this time she brought weed with her. Great the new valedictorian is going to be getting baked with the “frowned upon” kid. While hiding out in the woods, getting high we stumbled upon something I’ve never seen before. When did this graveyard get here I asked her while coughing up a lung. “Shit girl you don’t know? Oh have I got a story to tell you!”. She told the story of who else May, my skin went as pale as it did when my dad came through the door. “Who the fuck is May” trying to play it off. She explained the flowers and the young girl in the woods then she said “like May tells people not to talk about her or you’ll like die or something an this is the infamous graveyard of all the kids who snitch on her! Now I know you’re high because everyone knows that story.”. She then proceed to tell me that if you do encounter May in the woods and tell someone she will appear and “either kill you or turn you into a flower, if you see her run away because it’s a trap whatever flower she gives you after asking 3 questions is what you will turn into.”. Apparently we were at a graveyard where May killed a bunch of people allegedly. 

Years go by I’ve accepted that my life has changed and to just go with it. Lilly had already forgotten about May but I absolutely did not. Lilly went off to the University of New Hampshire and became a dental surgeon (go figure) and her husband an orthodontist had met on a German study abroad program. Every question we answered came true I aced my SATs and got into Yale on a full ride where I graduated valedictorian. 

Once both of my grandparents died I took over the old colonial it was much better than the shitty apartment I was in. I work remote so it was not a huge problem. Every night I would sit on that deck staring out at the woods. Always questioning if May was real or did my dad actually die. I always stare into the woods hoping I can see the field of flowers again. My second week of living alone questioning life I went out on the back deck again my usual nightly ritual and to my extreme surprise when I opened the back door there laid 14 red roses and 5 Lilly’s.
