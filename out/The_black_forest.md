Log 1: *Well, I’ve started a hike in a remote place called… I don’t know, I forgot, I think it was called… Black Forest or some crap like that? Anyways, the trails look pretty beautiful, there’s plenty of greenery around too. I also have a map, in case I get lost, plus a few flares.* **\[Log ended\]**

Log 2: *I’ve started to walk on the trails, I’m getting a little lost. I should be able to find my way back though. \*Paper rustles\* Crap. A gust of wind blew my map away. Welp, I’m definitely lost now.* **\[Log ended\]**

Log 3:  *I’m starting to think I’m not alone… every once in a while, in the corner of my eye I see moving shadows and figures. I also occasionally hear leaves rustling at night. It’s starting to get really foggy.* **\[Log ended\]**

Log 4: *I’m tired of wandering around hopelessly. I just want to find human civilization. I want to get out of this hellhole. Please.* **\[Log ended\]**

Log 5: *I’ve managed to find a nice clearing with a river to set up camp, there’s some berry bushes around too. I’m praying to god that some helicopter flies over the area so I can use my flares.* **\[Log ended\]**

Little did I know that no help was coming. I was stuck there, for what seemed like an eternity. Right now, 30 years after the incident, I managed to get back home. To find out how I did that, we have to jump all the way back to when I ended Log 5.

I was wandering around when I found a clearing I could set up camp in. I set up a tent, a fire and I used some nearby logs to improvise some seats. I ate some berries from the bushes, and before I knew, it was getting dark. It was a cold, foggy night. I could barely see 30 feet away. There was no reason to stay up, so I went to sleep inside the tent. The night had been pretty uneventful. But, I woke up at about 5:00 AM, and to describe what happened next, I’ll show you logs 6 and 7.

Log 6: *\*Leaves rustle\* Oh god. What the hell was that? Must’ve been a bear. \*Grabs big stick\* AHHHH! BAHHHHH! GO AWAY! SHOO! \*Leaves rustle\* Crap. It’s not leaving. Normally yelling makes them go away. Wha.. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?* **\[Log ended\]**

The “Thing” was like nothing i’ve ever seen before. I’ve seen some things. I’ve seen cults, witches, and other unimaginable things. But this.. it didn’t belong to earth. This was something else. Here’s log 7.

Log 7: *\*Breathes heavily\* I… Escaped.. it. That.. thing.. was.. I don’t even know.. I’m out of breath. I‘ve heard of some legends made by the locals of some entity called “The black beast”. I couldn’t even catch a glimpse of it. It was moving so fast. Its skin looked like it was made out of black latex. It had red eyes. I don’t know what to do about this thing. One of the locals gave me a book called “Myths and legends of the Black Forest”. It might be of some help.* **\[Log ended\]**

The book mentioned “The black beast”, but it didn’t have much information about it, as most people who meet it don’t come back to tell the story. But, of course, I did. Here I am, telling you the story. Anyways, let’s get back to the story. The book referred to the forest as some kind of an entity, not a place. It called the forest “An eternal prison”. What the hell did I have in my damn mind to go on a hike before reading the book. I would’ve saved myself all that torture. Here’s a few sentences from the book: “*The Black Forest is an otherworldly, eternal prison designed to keep all creatures that crawl, swim, walk, or slither. Anything can get in, but nothing can get out. It’s an infinite realm of chaos and suffering. The warden of the prison will judge any creatures that tread in it’s prison, and decide their fate.*“ I would’ve included the sentence after this, if it was there. It was entirely scribbled out for whatever reason.

I’m assuming the “warden“ is ”The black beast”. You really don’t want to know what the “Warden” does. It does unimaginable things. The book also mentioned encounters of “The black beast” outside of the Black Forest. It is described as “The shadow in the corner of your eye”. Let me show you log 8.

Log 8: *I’ve wandered off into the depths of the forest. There’s something about this forest that makes it like no other… it’s seemingly.. endless? Well, I’ve found a small cave. For now, I’ve set up camp there. I’ve tried exploring it, but I can’t really make it farther than about 200 feet, since everything starts getting cramped and dark.* **\[Log ended\]** 

After being in the cave, I found another person, and his name was jack. It gave me a huge amount of relief finding another human being. In log 9 I recorded myself meeting the person, but for some reason it says: “Unable to access file. Reason: file corrupted.“. That place has some weird crap going on. Anyways, as you can expect, the person I met died. He died a horrible death. Read log 10.

Log 10: Me: *Hey, jack. Let’s try to go to the other side of the cave. Jack: Ok. Me: It’s getting cramped in here. Jack: Don’t worry. I’ve been spelunking before, I’m pretty good at this. Me: I feel like we’re being watched.. Jack: Stop being a scaredy-cat. Me: No, really. Jack: So, what brought you here to the bla.. GAHH! \*Bones crunching\* Me: Oh.. Oh no.. I GOTTA GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!* **\[Log ended\]**

In all the commotion, I didn’t record how I actually got out of the cave, and the forest, but I managed to get out. Now, how would you explain the fact that it’s been 30 years since I got in the forest, stayed in the forest 3 days, and got out 30 years later? I really have absolutely no clue, and the book says absolutely nothing about it. The only thing I remember from when I escaped was, there was a bright light at the end of the cave, and when I went through it, I was right outside of a cave in Yellowstone. Park rangers managed to find me, treat my wounds and get me back home.   


If you ever hear about ”The Black Forest”, never… and I mean never.. go on a hike over there. You’ll see things that no one can explain, things no one can even imagine.
