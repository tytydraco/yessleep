I’m writing this because I’m in way over my head. I have no idea what I’m dealing with or what to do about my situation. If anyone out there has information—any at all—I’d appreciate it. The facade of my life is in shambles. More than it was before, even.

Don’t get me wrong, I had a charmed life compared to others. I had a nice suburban neighborhood, a dad who was a lawyer, and food always on the table thanks to my flawed stay-at-home mom. On paper, it was perfect. But it all felt so hollow. Superficial.

Even though I grew up with two parents, a house, and went to one of the top schools in the area, I never felt like I knew who they really were. It seemed like we had the ideal American lifestyle. Emphasis on "seemed." They fed me, bathed me, took me to school. But they never comforted me when I cried. Never read me bedtime stories. Never hung my art on the fridge—even the ones I was proud of.

But the real issue was my dad’s drinking.

He was, from what I understand, a highly functioning alcoholic. The moment he got home, he’d start throwing back bourbon like his life depended on it. By the seventh or eighth swig of Jim Beam, the yelling would start. The smallest mistake—from me or my mom—he’d snap. Cursing. Insults. Rage.

He never hit us, but that didn’t make it easier. I eventually got used to it. I tried my best not to upset him, walking on eggshells every night.

Luckily, he wasn’t in my life for long.

One night when I was in second grade, I was lying on the hardwood floor in the living room, drawing. My mom was making dinner—pot roast. The smell made my mouth water. She was a kind woman, but her eyes always looked... detached. Hollow.

Now that I’m older, I recognize that look: surrender. The kind you give when you’ve already died inside, years before.

I peered at her through the kitchen doorway. I was sketching her—frozen at the window, eyes distant.

Then the front door slammed. Loud. Violent. My dad stumbled in, already drunk. His thinning hair was a mess. His face, beet red with rage.

He threw his jacket on the floor and barreled into the kitchen, not even glancing at me. He normally didn’t come home this drunk—even though I knew he snuck sips at work.

My mom tensed.

“Phillip, what’s the matter?” she asked, voice shaky.

He didn’t answer. Just shoved past her and grabbed one of the bottles of Jim Beam from the cabinet. One of eight.

He took a huge swig.

“Did something happen at work?” she asked again, more hesitantly this time.

Usually, he’d come home, pour a drink, sit in his recliner, and watch whatever game was on. My mom would bring him dinner without a word.

But this night was different.

“Phillip, talk to me,” she tried again.

“I can’t take it here anymore!” he roared, five inches from her face. Then he hurled the bottle to the ground. It shattered into a sticky mess of glass and alcohol. I flinched.

My mom froze. She looked up at him, eyes wide.

But instead of screaming more, he grabbed another bottle and stormed out the door.

He never came back.

The next morning, cops showed up at our door. My dad had driven his Ford Explorer off the road. No other cars or pedestrians were involved. They asked my mom to come identify the body. I stayed home and drew in my sketchbook.

When she returned, she looked emptier than I’d ever seen her.

Soon after, we found out my dad had been drowning in debt. My mom never explained how or why. She didn’t talk about it.

Eventually, we were forced to move into a tiny apartment in a run-down part of Illinois.

My relationship with her fractured more every day. She got a job waitressing at some dive bar, doing anything to keep food on the table. She worked odd hours and left me home alone most nights. Now, I get a call from her maybe once a month. The conversations don’t last long. It feels like obligation, not love.

The trauma stuck with me.

By fifteen, I was in juvie for beating a kid so bad he needed reconstructive surgery. I got off easy—eight months in juvie, two years probation. Dropped out of high school at seventeen. Now I work full-time at Walmart and live in an even worse apartment. I never got my GED. My criminal record keeps me from getting hired anywhere else.

I moved out at eighteen and haven’t had a goal since. My life just... is. Has been for a while.

A few months ago, after a long day at work, I was waiting for my roommate Johnny to bring jumper cables. My battery had died during my double shift.

Johnny and I met in juvie. He was the only one who showed me the ropes—taught me what food not to eat, how to keep the tough kids away.

That night, the moon lit up the Walmart parking lot. I leaned against my 1998 Chevy Cavalier, smoking my third cigarette. Johnny said he’d be there "soon"—two hours ago. I hoped he wasn’t passed out drunk watching WrestleMania again. That happened more than I’d like to admit.

I was about to walk home when a black Kia pulled up.

A large man in his late 40s stepped out. Tattoos covered both arms.

“You okay, son? It’s late to be hanging out at Walmart.”

I hesitated, but told him the truth.

“Yeah. My car won’t start. Waiting for a jump.”

“I’ve got cables in the trunk. Want to use mine?”

“That’d be great. Thanks.”

He popped the trunk, hooked up the cables, and we stood there in silence for a bit. Eventually, he tried for small talk.

“Where you from?”

“Naperville.”

“Nice area,” he muttered.

After a few minutes, I turned the key. The engine hummed to life. Relief.

But he didn’t leave right away. Instead, he asked:

“You ever heard of the Windmill People?”

I blinked. “What?”

“The Windmill People.”

I squinted at him, suddenly unsure.

“No. Why?” I asked, eyebrows furrowed. Is this guy about to launch into some conspiracy cult nonsense? “Windmill People” sounded like a dollar store version of the Ant Hill Kids.

He looked like he wanted to explain, but he paused.

“You just seem—”

HONK!

Johnny’s obnoxious horn cut him off as he pulled into the lot, stoned out of his mind. Typical. He parked next to us and nearly flew out of his beat-up Corvette.

“Dude, sorry! Sarah had a freakout and I had to—uh... who’s this?” he asked, noticing the man beside me.

“Well, since you took so long, someone else actually showed up to help,” I snapped.

“Oh. Hi, I’m Johnny! Thanks for saving my bestest friend,” he said with a dopey grin. I shot him a glare.

The man chuckled. “Well, now that your friend’s here, I’ll be heading out.”

“Thanks,” I said, sticking out my hand.

“I’m Terrence.”

“Evan.”

He drove off. I turned to Johnny, who looked sheepish.

“What the fuck, man?”

“I know. I screwed up. L.S.D. for a week to make up for it?”

L.S.D. meant laundry, supper, dishes. We came up with it at fifteen. Don’t judge us.

“Make it two. I work the early shift tomorrow.”

“Deal. Car good?”

“Seems fine. Just follow me home, yeah?”

He nodded with an understanding grin.

We left.

As we drove away, I couldn’t stop thinking about the question Terrence had asked me.

“Make it two. I open tomorrow.”

He held up his hands like he’d been arrested. “Fair. Totally fair.”

I lit another cigarette. “You at least sober enough to follow me home?”

He gave me finger guns. “Sober? Never. Functional? Always.”

I rolled my eyes and got in my car.

A large man in his late 40s stepped out. Tattoos covered both arms.

It was late. The moon was full and the lot was dead quiet. I leaned against my '98 Cavalier, smoking my third cigarette while waiting for Johnny to bring jumper cables. He lived ten minutes away.

It had been two hours.

I checked my phone again. Nothing.

I swear, if that idiot passed out mid-WrestleMania with a beer in one hand and a corndog in the other...

I was about to say screw it and walk home when a black Kia rolled up. Out stepped this big guy, late 40s maybe, with colorful tattoo sleeves, like he got drunk at a biker bar and told the artist, “Surprise me.”

“You okay, son? It’s awful late to be hangin’ out at Walmart.”

I blinked. Took another drag. “Car’s dead. Waiting on a jump.”

He nodded like he’d expected that answer. “I got cables in the back. Want to use mine?”

I hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah. Thanks.”

He popped the trunk, grabbed the cables, and hooked them up. We stood there in silence while my battery soaked up what little juice it could. He tried to make small talk.

“Where you from?”

“Naperville,” I said, barely interested.

“Nice area,” he muttered, like he didn’t actually mean it.

I turned the key. The engine sputtered, then hummed. Relief washed over me.

We let the cars sit for a bit longer just in case. That’s when he said it.

“You ever heard of the Windmill People?”

I gave him a look. “...What?”

“The Windmill People.”

Oh no. Not this shit.

I squinted, already preparing to disengage. “No. Why?”

He tilted his head like he was trying to read something written on my soul. “It’s just—you seem—”

*HONK HONK HONNNNK.*

And cue *Johnny*.

His piece-of-crap Corvette swerved into the parking lot like it had three wheels and a dream. The door flung open and out he came, stoned off his ass but still moving like he’d just been shot out of a cannon.

“BRO! Sorry! Sarah started crying about—like—*emotional mold* or something, and I had to—wait, whoa, who’s this?” He pointed at the old man, then to the jumper cables like he was walking into a sting operation.

I didn’t bother hiding my irritation. “Since you took two hours, someone else helped.”

Johnny grinned. “Nice. Good Samaritan alert. You a real one, man. Thanks for saving my bestest boy.” He slapped my back like we were at summer camp.

The man—Terrence—chuckled politely. “Well, now that your friend’s here, I’ll get going.”

“Thanks again,” I said, sticking out my hand.

“Terrence.”

“Evan.”

He got in his car and drove off without another word.

I turned to Johnny, dead in the eyes. “What the fuck, man?”

He looked properly sheepish. “I *know*, I know. I suck. But—L.S.D. for a week?”

L.S.D. = Laundry, Supper, Dishes. It’s a dumb code we made up when we were fifteen. Don’t judge.

“Make it two. I open tomorrow.”

He held up his hands like he’d been arrested. “Fair. Totally fair.”

I lit another cigarette. “You at least sober enough to follow me home?”

He gave me finger guns. “Sober? Never. Functional? Always.”

I rolled my eyes and got in my car. As we drove away I pondered the question Terrence asked me. 







The next few days were a blur. I barely slept. I lived off Monster and nicotine just to stay awake. On my day off, I finally had a moment to breathe. I stayed in my room sketching a phoenix with colored charcoal—commission work. It helps me earn a little extra. Drawing has always been an escape. An escape from my dad’s belligerent yelling. From the constant ache of a neglected childhood. From my lifeless side-life.

I needed setting spray to finish the piece. I hadn’t used it in years, but I was sure I still had some buried in my closet. I reached for the top shelf and started pulling boxes down.

I opened a few. Found old Pokémon cards. Clothes that were too big for me. My collection of VHS tapes from when I was a kid. I paused when I saw one labeled “home videos” in black marker, scribbled on a strip of Scotch tape.

That stopped me cold. I’d never seen this tape before. I didn’t even know my parents *had* made home videos.

Curiosity got the better of me.

I slid the VHS into the dusty old TV in my room. I barely use the thing—it’s the same one my mom let me take from her storage when I moved out. Most days I just work on art or listen to audiobooks. Never felt like upgrading.

The blue screen flickered, then shifted to grainy footage of my parents. My mom looked happy—*alive* in a way I never remembered. My dad smiled and kissed her cheek.

That alone was disturbing. They’d never shown each other affection. Not once, not in front of me.

The footage glitched, then cut to a new recording.

My mom was talking to a man, her face tight with distress. It was hard to make out the guy’s face because of the lighting, but he wore a purple robe—completely out of place for late spring. He was holding something.

A baby.

I leaned forward, confused.

It was me.

I recognized the large brown birthmark on my shin. I had it since birth. No doubt about it.

The man handed me to my mother. The camera cut off.

And then the last clip began.

It’s the one that still keeps me up at night.

A group of people in deep purple robes and gold plague doctor masks stood in a circle. They were chanting—something guttural, rhythmic. Latin, maybe? I don’t know. I’ve never been good with languages, but it didn’t sound human.

The camera zoomed in.

Standing in the center of the circle was a man in a crimson robe.

My dad.

He looked exhausted—legs trembling under the weight of the unconscious woman he held in his arms. Her limbs dangled limply. Her skin was streaked with sweat and caked in dirt, but she wore a white dress, pristine and untouched by the grime. The contrast made her look ghostly.

My dad carried her to the center, to what looked like a massive altar or anvil—but made of gold, etched with bizarre, curling symbols. He laid the woman across it.

Then, he raised a knife high above his head.

I couldn’t breathe.

He drove it into her chest. Deep. The blade disappeared in one brutal motion.

She didn’t even flinch.

The chanting grew louder—more frenzied—as blood pooled across the golden stone. I sat frozen, staring at the screen. Unable to look away.

And then I turned off the TV.

But there’s one detail I can’t forget. One that still makes my skin crawl whenever I remember it.

The woman’s belly was enlarged.
