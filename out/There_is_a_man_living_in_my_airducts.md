I can explain, I promise. But you have to listen first.

  
My mother, as a real estate agent, has always told me to check the background of any house I buy. Is there gang activity in the area? Is there a high risk of natural disasters? Has anybody died under suspicious circumstances in the house?

In the bland town of Crow's Landing, near St. Paul, nothing like the above could ever happen. The neighborhood was mostly occupied by retiree-age, white, middle class Americans, in which the most exciting thing that had happened to them was going on a routine trip to Disneyland at the age of 7.

Thus, I was a little shocked to find that Richard and Tanya Deuters had gone missing from the very house I was buying 17 years earlier. The obituaries in the newspaper mentioned him as A Dedicated And Kind Citizen, while she was relegated to a Loving Wife And Mother. Her body was found 4 years after her disappearance in an abandoned apartment complex, pooled in a strange, black, tar-like liquid, with strange symbols repeatedly carved into her skin. Nobody thought much of it, regarding it in a "well, that's a shame" way. 

Either way, the house was cheap, so I bought it. I got a decent but not great rate for the mortgage, I bought decent but not great furniture, so on and so on. This property seemed like a perfect allegory for my bland life- I got B's and C's in school, I was good enough at football but always at the periphery of our team, my family was rich enough to have 3 children and go on vacations to visit Gramma every year in Florida. Even my town was the perfect allegory for this- decently sized with a population of around 10,000 and a mainly middle-aged, white, demographic. I was hardworking in my adult life but nothing exceptional, thus I got an office job in a small building on the periphery of our town.

As the youngest son, I didn't get a choice of room, so when I first entered and unlocked the house, a strange sense of ecstasy entered me. I raced upstairs, until I found the seemingly perfect room to captivate my inner child- an attic-like triangular room at the top of our house. I thought nothing of the airduct that snaked its way across the ceiling.

The rest of the day was unremarkable. My sister, Kylie, was helping out with the unpacking, and as I started settling in to my new house to the music of Cannons' *Shadows (Midnight) EP*, I could have sworn I heard tapping through the walls, though that could have been part of the music or maybe Kylie dropped something?

Just as I finished putting up a *Starboy- The Weeknd* poster up on the walls of my apartment, my watch stated that it was 10:30 and thus time for me to go to bed. Kylie had left earlier, at 8, because her Golden Retriever had not been walked all day and her husband was an "incompetent nincompoop". 

Truth be told, I was a little frightened, as it was my first time all alone in a strange house that was all mine- me alone, at night. I tried to fall asleep, and eventually, I felt my eyesight blurring and my head getting fuzzy. 

And then I heard it. An odd, methodic tapping on the walls. 3 slow beats, then 4 fast ones. This pattern repeated 4 times. I woke up, and checked the time. *11 37*, nothing too odd here. It perplexed me a bit, but I attributed it to the fact that this was an old house with an old air conditioning system. 

I called Kylie, and nobody picked up.

I went back to sleep, staring at Abel Tsefaye's face on the wall as he had his head in his hands, staring directly back at me. At this time, I came to an odd conclusion that the Starboy himself was some sort of guardian angel protecting me from whatever was in the airducts. The night grew longer and darker, and I gradually became more paranoid, although nothing else had happened. 

When the sun rose, I was already in the kitchen, eating some of the casserole that Kylie had brought over. It had hints of mold creeping up on the sides, which I found perplexing because she baked it 2 days ago. The flowers on my table were wilted and crumbling, which shouldn't have happened. The whole area had a stench of rot and death to it.

I went grocery shopping that day. It shouldn't have taken me the whole day, but it did. I could have sworn that I only took 30 minutes, more or less. It was 8 am when the store opened, and I barely managed to grab a sack of rice, a few zucchinis, some seasoning, a 8 ounce cut of skirt steak, and a bag of pistachios as a treat. When I finally left the store, it was dark outside. Oddly enough, I hadn't seen anyone else in the store, not even an employee. I used the self checkout and left silently.

I was too tired to cook the steak, so I just boiled some rice and ate the pistachios. I forgot to buy utensils and all the stores were closed, so I just ate with my hands. Thankfully, I remembered to bring pots and bowls, so I at least had a way to eat. I made a mental note to buy some utensils, maybe stop by Pottery Barn or something?? I was so tired that I barely made my way up to my room, collapsing in my bed.

The Starboy's eyes brought me back to reality.

None of this made sense. Why was everything dead in my living room? Why was everywhere abandoned, and why did time move so fast, and why was everything drawing me back to this room? I was going to text Kylie, but my wifi failed. Even though I had cellular, nothing worked. Thus, I decided to go to bed.

I heard the tapping again. 1-2-3, 1234, stronger and louder this time. *11 37* again, always 11 37. It felt like something had bound me to my bed. No matter how much I struggled, I couldn't get up. I felt like something forcibly moved my head up to the roof, at an uncomfortable angle. 

The tapping in the airduct was getting louder, until it was more like banging instead of tapping. The side caved in, then bulged out, in and out, in and out, and I was terrified that it wouldn't hold and whatever was inside of it would escape.

Hurriedly, I called the Crow's Landing Ventilation Company, before remembering that it was now 11 43 and nobody would pick up. I tried my best to fall asleep, wearing my best pair of noise-cancelling headphones, but no matter what, my mind still drifted to the airduct up on top. 

The next morning when I woke up, a horrible smell emanated from the kitchen. An entire pool of blood was on the floor of the kitchen, with more dripping from the fridge. I opened it and was immediately hit in the face with an even worse smell and multiple flies circling in the air. 

This was the meat that I had bought yesterday. It was rotting like it had been dead for 2 weeks.

I called the ventilation company, in a hurry, sitting in my car in the deserted street. Nobody was outside.

"Alright, we will go over to your house and check it out. Please state your address below."

I found this odd, but I had never called a repairman before, so maybe this was all part of the gist. I walked into a deserted cafe, asked for a muffin before realizing that there was nobody behind the counter, and sat there until I got a call from the company. It seemed like only 10 minutes had passed! But it was already dark outside, and the company was done.

"There's nothing up there, except for a minor roach infestation. You should call our sister company, Crane's Landing Exterminators."

When I got home, I collapsed in bed and waited for 11 37 to come.

Just like that, tapping occured for a few seconds, agonizingly slow, until a crack appeared on the airduct. It spiderwebbed as more banging occured. In a final moment of sanity, straining my head, I looked into the eyes of the Starboy.

They were mutilated and bleeding with some sort of red paint, otherwise all scratched out. The poster was ultimately defaced and had rips and tears in some places.

Not even the Weeknd could save me now.

From the airducts, came a final, heaving bang. The airduct splintered in two, and gave a horrible creeeeeeeeeeeeakkkkkkk before it deposited its contents right on to the bed, just a few inches from where I was lying.

It was a man, if you could even call it that. The thing was grimy and looked like it hadn't washed in 2 decades. Its eyes were sunken in and bloodshot, as were its cheeks. It was emaciated and revolting. Rashes and sores covered all of its body, and its fingernails were long and yellowed. 

Leaning barely 2 inches away from my cold body, leering at me with its horrible yellow teeth, it whispered in a horrible, creaking voice:

"*I can explaiiiiiiinnnnn... I prooooommmmiseeeeeeeee..."*
