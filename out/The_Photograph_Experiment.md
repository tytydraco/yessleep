The Photograph Experiment

There was once a lab called Murlik labs. Murlik labs was built in the year 1956 but then got destroyed in the year 1995.

Murlik labs was a very nice place. The creator of the lab, a man named Dr. John Murlik, was a very charming man who was very nice to his employees. Scientists there were very good at their research, having the bottom floor for studying biology, while the top floor was for studying chemistry. Schools went there occasionally for field trips and scientists always loved touring kids around the lab, encouraging them to keep studying science and making it super fun for children.

On April 24th, 1994, a year before the lab was destroyed, Dr. Murlik sent out flyers around town for a sleepover night in the lab advertising “a night of science” for ages five to fifteen. The sleepover would take place on May 5th, 1994 and ten kids were only allowed to be part of the sleepover, five boys, and five girls. In order to become part of the sleepover, the parents had to mail a letter to the lab, saying everything about the child so the scientist could choose which kids they wanted to become part of the sleepover. This made the lab mailbox become flooded with letters of children who wanted to become part of the sleepover.

But really, the children weren’t gonna be on a one night sleepover. No. Dr. Murlik wanted to do an experiment on the children, a torturous and demonic experiment, in which he wanted to find out how one simple photo could affect children’s eyes. He wanted to lure the ten kids in his lab and the “sleepover” was just bait. He wanted to show a picture of a girl slitting her wrists projected onto a screen and then worsen the picture each day. He wanted the experiment to be ten days, from May 5th to May 15th. Afterwards, he wanted to see what the one picture could do to a child.

On the night of May 5th, parents, totally unaware of what Dr. Murlik was gonna do to their children, sent their kids to the lab. Dr. Murlik nicely greeted the children as he told the parents that this was “an only children’s night” and they couldn’t say.

The second that all the parents went away, Dr. Murlik opened a huge, metal door that said RESTRICTED on it in big, red letters. The children were excited to see what Dr. Murlik had in store for them as the flier promised to study the wonders of chemistry and biology and even space.

Once the children were in the dark and cold basement, Dr. Murlik said that he wanted to do an activity with the kids. He told the boys and girls to go into two separate bulletproof glass rooms and close the doors. In the rooms were five beds for each child and a glass case for five knives. What was separating them was a big wall. The boys went into the one on the left and the girls went onto the one on the right.

Once the kids were in the rooms, Dr. Murlik told them to look at the wall. The kids did as Dr. Murlik then projected the image of the girl slitting her wrists. The girl had a huge, sharp knife that she used to slit her wrists, while having a demonic smile and was looking up at the children, staring at them with her cold and starry eyes.

Immediately, the children turned their happiness to fear as they wondered what was going on. They tried to ask Dr. Murlik, but he told them to stare at the picture. This made the children cry as they were forced to stare at the picture.

After five minutes, a child asked Dr. Murlik when they were getting out and doing something else but then, Dr. Murlik said in a chilled voice: “Ten days.” This made the children bang on the glass and scream for their parents, knowing that this man lied to everyone. But no matter how hard or how loud the children screamed, Dr. Murlik ignored them and told them to look at the picture.

The entire night, the children stared at the picture as if they looked away, they were yelled at and even slapped at to continue to look at the picture and do nothing else.

After that night, the children were reported to be exhausted as they begged for food. Surprisingly, Dr. Murlik had his assistants bring them cornflakes for breakfast as the children ate and continued to stare at the evil picture. They were forced to stare at the picture for the remainder of the day and got scrambled eggs for lunch, and fried fish for dinner.

That night, the children tried to fall asleep, but three of the girls and two of the boys couldn’t because the disturbing picture was keeping them up. The rest of the kids, who had no sleep in twenty four hours, fell asleep, but the next day, they reported to have gory nightmares of the girl killing them. One boy, aged eight, was reported to have said that he had a nightmare of him slitting his wrists.

The next day, when the children woke up, Dr. Murlik made the picture a bit brighter. At first, the children shielded their eyes, but then they got used to it and continued to stare at the picture. The children still yelled that they wanted to go home, but it was reported to have stopped at 4:23pm, when the last kid, the five year old girl, cried, yelling: “I WANT TO GO HOME!!!” The children had to accept the idea that they weren’t gonna go home until the experiment was done.

At the end of the day, the children said that their eyes hurt and one boy swore that he was almost blind. No one did anything for him, except for that one assistant who gave him eye drops. That night, only one of the boys and one girl got sleep. The children were reported to have said that the picture was too bright for sleep as when the lights went off for sleep, the gory picture glowed and shined in their eyes.

On the third day of the experiment, something even more disturbing happened. The photo was already disturbing enough of the girl slitting her wrists, but now, Dr. Murlik activated it to cackle demonically in a deep voice. The picture cackled the entire day, this time making the children cover their ears and start to once again cry. But no matter how much they covered their ears, the sound found a way into their little ears. This continued for the fourth day as well.

The fourth night, Dr. Murlik decided to turn off the picture and stop the demonic cackling that went along with the picture. At first the children were relieved that the picture stopped and thought that the experiment was over, and that they were finally going home. But, Dr. Murlik planned to turn it back on in three hours.

The first hour, the children said that they were very, very dizzy. Three boys and two girls said that they couldn’t even walk straight without falling down for a second, and everyone else said that they had a headache. The kids reported having worse headaches than others and the youngest one, a five year old boy, said that his head was gonna explode.

The second hour got worse. The children started to unintentionally scream. An eight year old screamed the loudest for a timed ten minutes and then lost her voice. She was pointing to her voice box, which probably had broken. The other children were screaming, screaming out loud, or at each other. The other half of the second hour was that they started to speak gibberish. They went around, just mumbling out random words, forgetting how to talk.

The third hour was the worst. The children then turned to his or her peers and started to fight them. It didn’t matter who it was, who was next to one of the children started to get hurt. Everyone in the room started to fight with each other, hitting and kicking them. The children were going crazy at the moment as an experimenter said that the children were now not human anymore.

But, the fourth night, the picture was once again turned on with its laugh, but this time, the children were already getting used to it. That night, when most of the kids were asleep, it was reported that an experimenter snuck into the rooms and saw that the children’s eyes were mostly red from the picture, and most of them had black eyes and bruises from hitting each other for so long.

The fifth day, the picture was now no longer just a picture. Instead, the picture now started to blink. The eyes of the girl were a disturbing color of brown, making her stare at the kids, no matter where they went, but now, it blinked. The eyes turned to red for a second, and then turned back to the brownish color that it was when the experiment started. The new red eyes were so bright that even a few of the experimenters had to shield their eyes from it.

Just then, the youngest boy went crazy. He started to scream his head off for a timed twenty minutes and bang on the floor like he had a temper tantrum. After that, he ran around the room and bit everyone. Everyone who he tried to bite, tried to fight him off, but they couldn't because he was too strong. Everyone in the boys’ room got injured that day and got cuts and scratches from the five year old who at first was a scared little kid who whimpered a lot. Then, he bit everyone for an hour straight. The sixth day also had the blinking eyes.

At that point, all the children could never be recovered. They were all psychotic. They forgot how to talk, walk, and Dr. Murlik himself even described the kids as “little animals”. Even if he ended the experiment early, the children could never be recovered. But the experiment wasn’t over yet.

The seventh and eighth day got much worse than anything. The picture was already worse enough, with a picture of a girl slitting her wrists, making a demonic laughter sound, and now, it had blinking eyes that already made a five year old child go insane. But now, the bright projection moved to a little animation of the girl slitting her wrists and cackling while she did it.

By now, the children just stared, staring at the demonic picture that turned into a little looped animation. They didn’t hurt or touch anyone. They just stared. Stared just like they were supposed to in the beginning. No one cried or begged to leave now. They just stared and stared. Even when an eight year old girl continuously rubbed her eyes and must've gotten blind according to a report, she didn’t stop staring.

Suddenly, an aged ten girl went up to the youngest five year old girl and bit her neck. She bit and bit it until blood came out and spilled everywhere on the ground. The five year old girl dropped dead to the ground. The other girls saw this and instead of stepping away from the psychotic ten year old, they tried to imitate her and crawled or those who could still walk, went to their peers and tried to imitate what the ten year old did. Another girl, aged eight, died from this.

Then, there was one report that an experimenter witnessed when his partners were out for lunch. The report said that the surviving three girls went to the two dead corpses and started to eat them. They chewed and spit out the bones, and when they were done, they had blood and organs on their mouths that spilled onto their clothes. When they weren't hungry and ate the corpses, they decided to continue staring at the animation.

The tenth day was the final day of the experiment as two girls were already dead and one of the boys, aged seven, died from seizures. Dr. Murlik then told an experimenter to release the knives from the bulletproof glass. At this point, the children were reported to be drowsy and tired but still stared at the animation.

When the glass box opened, the children slowly turned their heads towards it. They didn’t go to the knives, they just stared. They just stared and stared at the knives instead of the animation. Suddenly, an age seven girl went to the knives and stared at it closely for a reported five minutes.

After, she picked up a knife and then walked slowly over to the age fifteen girl and then stabbed her in the back. Blood poured out of her back as she fell to the floor. The fifteen year old girl fell to the floor but then got up and stole the knife from the seven year old and then stabbed her to death.

The boys also got a hold of the knives. One boy, aged eleven, took the knife and tried to stab one of his peers, who was aged nine and tried to stab him but missed. The nine year old then charged at the eleven year old and stabbed him in the stomach, killing him.

Then, the fifteen year old boy started to scream his head off and then went to the bulletproof glass doors, screaming: “HELP!! HELP!!”, the last words that he knew. He banged and banged on the bulletproof glass until the nine year old boy tried to stab him with a knife but missed.

The fifteen year old boy then picked him up and then started to choke him for a reported thirty seconds. When he was done, he threw him and he landed on a bed that tipped over to the ground. The fifteen year old slowly walked to the bed that the nine year old fell on and picked up the bed and smashed it onto the nine year old multiple times, killing him.

On the girls side, the fifteen year old died, due to blood loss, after being stabbed by the age seven girl. The boys’ side wasn’t doing that well either. The fifteen year old boy started to scream and scream and threw the beds across the bulletproof room, breaking them. One bed accidentally hit the five year old, murdering him. With the fifteen year old left on the boys’ side, he then went to the knives and started to throw the knives around. He then slowly walked to the front of the bulletproof glass but tripped on a bed and hit his head so hard on a knife that he died.

With the ten year old girl left, she then walked around the room, staring at the bloody corpses of the dead girls that were in the room. She stared and stared as she went to the knives and picked up the biggest knife and looked at it. She then glanced at the animation of the girl cackling and slitting her wrists and decided to copy her. The ten year old slit her wrist in front of the watching experimenters.

The experimenters were grossed out by everything that happened and threw up. They didn’t think that everyone would die, and thought that the kids would just get seizures. They started to scream at Dr. Murlik for making them do the experiment and then ran to kill him. But, Dr. Murlik had a pistol with him as he shot each one of the experimenters that attempted to kill him. When he was finished, he took a look at the last surviving person of the experiment, the ten year old girl, slitting her wrists and making an evil, bloody smile, and staring right at Dr. Murlik, just like in the animation. A few seconds later, she collapsed to the floor.

Dr. Murlik then walked up from the lab and then realized that he just murdered ten children. He lied to the parents of the children that their children ran away from the lab and never returned.

Dr. Murlik then went downstairs to the RESTRICTED room and went inside the bulletproof glass rooms. He then dragged each child corpse inside storage rooms in the RESTRICTED room. Afterwards, he took all of the dead scientist's bodies and hid them also with the children. To cover up the experiment, he ordered for the lab to be demolished. And a few days later, Murlik labs was destroyed.

Dr. Murlik then walked away from the ruins of the lab as he lied to everyone that it was because of money that the lab had to be demolished. Dr. Murlik then made himself a new life by working in another lab called Jada labs.

The experiment was all covered up, Dr. Murlik successfully drove away all evidence that he lured the children and killed them. He covered up the fact that he forced the children to participate in a painful experiment. He covered up the murders of all the experimenters that helped him. He covered up the experiment itself. He covered it up. All of it up.
