Hey I just wanted to talk about my experience so far and try and get some assistance from anyone who may have answers to help or solve issue. And sorry in advance for the random rambling of myself 

While this is called the tapping on my window, this will have several other things that have happened to me since about 10-11 months ago. I’m not sure what started it but I just know it had started then. (I’ve had previous paranormal encounters but those do not apply to this situation I’m pretty sure)

It started with me at work at my local Cinemark, I was cleaning a theater by myself(cause my other coworkers were slow and always joked around during the job and it took them 3 of them to clean one in like 10 minutes while I could clean 2 in 10, so I just did things myself because I was fast and efficient) when I was cleaning up the theater I started to see out of the corner of my eye I see a teen boy running behind me. But when I turn around there is nobody there, so I go back to cleaning when I see a head pop up from behind a chair, I thought it was a just a guest from the previous movie who had fallen asleep or something that I just didn’t see at first. But when I went to go ask them if they needed help with something, they were gone. 

I thought maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me so I finished cleaning that theater and moved on to the next one without thinking anything of it, and when I started on the next one I began seeing what I thought was the same person from before (forgot to mention what they looked like, they weren’t very tall, probably 5’8 max, they had short white hair, very pale skin, I couldn’t tell what color eyes they had, but they were wearing a red shirt with a darker stripe in the middle. I couldn’t see what kind of bottoms they were wearing) walking around the screen of the theater, I asked them what they were doing and what they needed when they proceeded to walk through the wall in front of the screen. I double checked that there wasn’t a door by the screen and that there wasn’t anyone there or a way to get out without me seeing. 

Now I’m a little freaked out, so I quickly finish that theater and move on to the next. I began quickly sweeping and cleaning this one so I could just go back to being behind the counter, but I couldn’t begin to imagine what happened next. The same boy, was running up the stairs to the top row of the seats, I have seen too many horror movies so I noped out of there leaving my coworkers to finish that one. I quickly went to the ushers(the ones that clean/ take care of the theatre) to ask if they have had any similar experiences, and not to my surprise they almost all said they have had similar experiences but without the white hair boy. 

I was a bit freaked out but I went along for the day before I had to go home, nothing too interesting happened for about a week or two after the first incident, even then it wasn’t much. I began seeing the same boy from before in my peripheral vision. I thought I had just been watching too many scary movies, but it continued to when I got a new job at smoothie place, but it got a bit worse there. I could be there completely alone, and I know I’m alone because there was a bell that let me know when anyone entered the building. But I’d see people walking behind me or the bathroom doors would slam shut or open by themself, and things would seem to fall off the self by themselves. 

Then it started at my house, I started seeing hun in the corner of my eye. Then other people started noticing things too or hearing things too, my family friend ( let’s call him Derek)and I were in my room talking when we heard one of my bongs on my self move and clink against another bong. We both stopped mid conversation and turned to ask each other  if we had heard what just happened. That was when more stuff started moving. 

My sister( let’s call her Sara) came to visit from Colorado, and in my room I have a couch that is a pullout bed as well, so she was sleeping in my room with me. I had wanted ice cream so I started putting on some clothes and getting ready to run to the corner store, and while I was getting ready I heard a loud slam against my closet wall. Then it sounded like someone was walking through my closet, and then the door started to be pushed out like someone was trying to open it from the inside. While that was scary, the feeling I felt as it happened was so so much worse than anything I could possibly imagine. It was pure horror and fear and anxiety. I had never ever in my life been as scared as that, even when we thought someone was breaking into our house. 

I was completely frozen. And after what felt like forever I turned to my sister, to see her wide eyed. Sara began to ramble eventually being able to say she thought I was in the closet and that she thought I had just dropped something. She mentioned that I looked like I was sick, like I’m a very white person but it was like all the blood drained from my body, like I was dead. I somehow got out of bed asked if there was anyone in there, nobody replied so I opened up the closet door with my hunters knife( it’s about 9 inches blade alone) and when I made sure nobody and nothing was in there and there was no way for anything to get into my closet except the door, we both immediately got out shit together and left the house and went out for ice cream cause we needed to get out of the house, when I got back I had found out one of my sculptures had been thrown against the wall, leaving a mark hole as well that I had to patch and paint over. Safe to say we didn’t end up sleeping in my room night. ( I will add pictures later) 

Since then I woke up at like 3 something in the morning to another of my sculptures had been thrown off the top of my dresser(it wouldn’t roll off or get blown away by the wind it was up there very secure) knocking over 4 of my glass pieces. Luckily it only broke one. But it was thrown like across my room, if it had fallen it would’ve only gone a few feet from my dresser, I even tested it( the sculpture was paper mache so it didn’t break, I moved the other glass pieces too so they wouldn’t break either) and it only landed only a couple feet from the dresser. Then most recently last night I was watching tv when I heard clear as day 3 sharp taps against my window. I nearly shit myself. I called a friend of mine to calm down and eventually fall asleep. 

To be honest not much has happened today besides the living room light turning on by it’s self while I was making a bagel but nothing too crazy. And also on a possibly related note I have been waking up at odd hours of the night in cold sweats, and I have been waking up with scratches in random places over my body. My mother doesn’t believe me, my friends think it’s just my mind playing tricks in me, hell my mom says I need to pray more, or that I need more Jesus or that I need psychiatric help. But I’m not sure what to do or how to prevent things like this from happening or to know if I really am just going crazy. Any advice??
