It's the start of summer, and I was working the night shift at my dead-end job in a petrol station far out in the countryside. I mean entirely out of the way from any living person. No old retired recluses by the sea and no rich manors just passerbyers. You see, the location isn't as creepy as it may seem. I know it's usual for the stereotype that the countryside is where you find people like Ed Gein but It was truly desolate. An abandoned part of Wales that apparently, after the town that was demolished in the 1970s, no one else wanted to live there. Just miles and miles of crop fields and the usual wild animals. I am sure if anyone who is not British is seeing this you may think about bears, coyotes or maybe eagles but no. I mean foxes, hedgehogs and the occasional fox crossing the road right outside the station. In all honesty, I might have preferred to have cranky crazed farmers with shotguns nearby because then you can tell what is creeping you out at night. 

The emptiness was something else. 

I thought no one lived there because it was preserving the nature surrounding the area as it was covered in rows of flowers which inhabited every colour of the rainbow and ponds with frogs and lily pads. (besides a rusted petrol station and the washed up 20 something year olds that work within). But the more I worked there the more I realised why. Once the sun rested at night the place felt like it had a million eyes. I know it's a random analogy but it really felt as if the atoms floating around came alive. Like the darkness could see me and I could see it. Sometimes when I look outside and I see the never-ending rows of grass and the abyss that covets it, I feel as though it is something more. You know the feeling of someone watching you. Even when you are 100 hundred percent sure you aren't being watched, you still feel it. It's similar. When I was living with my parents, I would feel as though at any second someone would be standing at the window if I stared too long. Not even to hurt me, but to just watch. In the dark you're vulnerable. The idea of someone watching when you're at your weakest freaked me out. Which is why I hated working the night shifts. It felt as though the woods were that stranger. The true face of its intent is masked in darkness when my primal instincts are at their highest. 

This shift wasn’t any different. I wish I could say I felt more scared than usual but no. It was the same feeling. Complete exposure to the cosmos of potential. I was close to finishing my shift. All i had to do was wait for my coworker to take over as it got closer to 5am. Just to answer questions on why I was there so late, the petrol station was apparently “unstable” and damaged. Trust me, I have sought to find any answer to what that means to no avail. The only information I can pass forward from what I have heard was that there was vandalism recently and the manager wanted workers at all times to make sure no damage comes to the property. The petrol station was very ‘vintage’ due to the nostalgic stubbornness of our manager. We had no cameras (or recent technology) to do the better job of capturing anyone, allegedly, vandalising the property. On top of that, i had no clue what the fuck he expected someone as scrawny and cowardly as me to do anything if i did see anyone. Which to let you know didn't help calm the irrational nerves of a stranger being out there now that there was one vandalising the place. However, it was extra pay and I am a sucker for money. Plus being enslaved to insomnia helps me be productive rather than spending my hours watching silent movies in the dark.

There I was, waiting and hoping for an early arrival from my coworker as the radio of the shop was starting to get under my skin. Recently, my manager, one day brought in a very old looking radio box. Its wooden shell was pristine but it had this stench. An odour of rot. You can tell when something is alive, it has a presence that breathes life. Sometimes a person's radiance can tell you who they are. This radio's decaying smell was its presence. As for its sound, it was constantly overpowered by static and the voices of the station meshed together. I only physically saw it the day it was brought in. Since it was so old, it wasn't even hooked up to any speakers. 

To paint the picture, there was a counter on your right as soon as you walked in which had the staff room behind it. The staffroom led to a long corridor which passed the bathroom, storage room and finally at the very end of the shop. The manager's room. This had the banking, shop phone, etc. That's where it was placed. A hole was cut into the wall that let the radio echo through the shop. 

I like our manager, we will call Leighton, he was understanding and generally a nice guy. Like I said, the station was vintage for a reason. He was obsessed with keeping things how he grew up. Very touchy but never, and I mean never, this wound up about a damn fucking anything. He kept it in the back of the shop under lock and key. Only way to see it would be to get on your toes or a box to peek over the hole. I could shrug this off, sure it was old and smelly, sure it meant more to him than usual and sure keep it in the back. It's that radio station that gets under my skin the most. 

Jack's Hour.

The show seems to be made decades ago, somehow the radio is picking up on echoes from a time i cant recognise. With a host called Jack. He's eccentric and has that atlantic accent. At times it seemed as if he was speaking absolute nonsense which could also be attributed to the static that blared over or his accent. Playing his own ballads of strange stories that were made seemingly on the spot. 

My shift was almost over.I was tired. Exhausted. I simply had no energy to stand anymore as I sat until my coworker took my place. For once I felt the need to sleep. To close my eyes and drift. I could have done it right there and then but the speakers had been playing up the whole day. Static over took the speakers like a parasite. To say the least it was unbearable. As i began to zone out a message brought me back

‘I'm sorry but I'm gonna be late. Took the wrong road and now I need to back track. 20 minutes max. Plz don't tell Leighton. He's already pissed at me soz.’ 

It was my coworker. the message added to the creeping headache. It may seem like I'm being overly dramatic about how annoying ‘Jack’ was but the sole reason I was enduring it anyways wasn't because my manager told me so. It was because someone else had already tried to switch it off. Lord knows why I still tried whilst even knowing this. When the radio first was here, a coworker who I had become friends with through work, decided to turn it off. He was working the same type of shift I was. Guarding the station at the start of the vandalism.  

Josh was working through it until he decided that he had enough. He wanted to turn it off and so he did. I really can't figure out how this came about or any explanation to why so I'm just going to write it as it is. My manager, Leighton, was in the radio room. For the whole time Josh had worked he had thought he was alone. He pleaded to me to believe him that he never saw him come in. He was convinced he was there all day. Josh said that he never saw him until he turned off the radio. He was in disarray and I couldn't make out the details after he started to break down in tears. Leighton was angry and Josh was fired. From then on I never saw him again. Only recently I got a call from him reassuring me he was okay and doing better. I tried to talk to him about it but he didn't want to talk about it as he ‘moved on’. I think he was just embarrassed or even scared. Poor guy was a sensitive person so I knew he was still affected by it although he didn't say it.

The next however long I had left was unpaid and so I was fed up. I was overcome with emotion and although I knew I shouldn't have done it all day, I decided to anyway. I could feel my anger pulling me like strings on a puppet to where the radio was. I thought at least me and Nick are close so he would go easy on me. These thoughts fueled a foolish confidence that started to confront something hiding in the back of my mind the whole night. Is he waiting? Is he here? Why on gods green fucking earth would he be here? Truth be told, even my morbid curiosity was a part of my mission as I wanted to peek behind the curtain. I don't know why I felt as though I needed to go into the room but I did. And so I went. At the back of the shop, there was a hall on my left and right. The right led straight to the break room and to the left is a corridor that turns another corner. Twisted corridors that stop at a lonely stockroom. This is where the radio resided. 

I stood in the stale back rooms of the petrol station's as I tried to ignore the sweat from my pores sliding into my eyes. I was shitting myself. I don't know why on earth suddenly the workplace I've chosen and worked at for a solid year now feels no longer like a place to let my guard down. Even if I'm no longer open to the environment I felt the opposite terror as I made my way to the radio. That i was now trapped. Backed into a corner like the prey of a wolf. It made me queasy with anxiety but I shrugged off my superstitions as merely consequences of no sleep and a long work day. Maybe my tired mind was the result of my lack of awareness of my body telling me to run. 

The door to the radio was chained. Rustic leashes draped over kept it from anyone going in. The chains were like ones to pull down an anchor. It sounds crazy but they were added after what Josh had done. I had seen it before and knew it was there but at midnight, by myself, and with the creepy ass radio with a man singing over ukulele made things seem more daunting than usual. I can only put into words the incomprehensible smell that was looming out of the room. Rot. Pure rot of metal and damp wood. 

Although there were extensive measures to keep this room shut. It was open. It was undisturbed. The chains remained. The door, whilst its paint was still peeled and wooden rotted, remained. Creeping towards the slight crack in the door I thought of the potential image of Nick alone in this room. It felt as though the memory is alive as the vivid imagery turns slowly to me now. I don't know why but in my mind's eye I see him turn, his face missing. Even now as I write I can feel him scream and dread weakening my limbs.

He wasn't there. Relief boosted my confidence once again. It felt as though I survived a chase as the fleeting adrenaline wore off. At that moment a naive embarrassment hit me. Why on earth was I so scared? Rationalisations became easier to swallow as I thought more about whatever was causing me so much fear. The room I stepped into was the bare minimum of clean. It was very anticlimactic. 

I didn't bother to take in the room's mediocre surroundings as I went to the radio. It was on the floor. It seemed to have been placed inside a box but the container must've been damaged as the wood seemed to be dissolved. I'm guessing Nick tried to give it extra protection but some insects had broken down its container. Actually come to think of it, everything in the vicinity of the radio was rotting. It seemed like he kept very little care in getting rid of mould that ran up the walls and floor that spread from the radio. I mean the smell was horrendous and I did wonder how on earth this stench was never picked up on but the room was entirely shut off. There was no ventilation, no windows and the door was sealed shut. Everything feels wrong about this. Why did he care so much yet let it be surrounded by such a hazardous environment. 



Once I finally overcame the smell by moving my attention to the radio, everything else that troubled me was nothing compared to what had happened next. For starters, It was a pretty sizeable radio about 4 feet in length and 2 feet in width. It was unscathed from anything, even the mould around it. Its wooden exterior was impeccable. When i tell you this was the perfect radio. I mean it had the most well kept and polished wood I have seen. It felt as though something I couldn't see existed around it, something that drew me closer to just.

Touch it

And so I did.



Going to turn the volume down was when I noticed how wet it was. It wasn't wet, it was covered in small drops of water. I touched the volume button which I was met with  a burning sensation once I made contact. I felt it again to make sure it was the radio but it was warm, boiling even. My hands felt soggy after reaching for it which i realised it was as if the radio was sweating?? I know it sounds ridiculous but I mean that's what it felt like. It felt like it could see me. There wasn't much time between touching it before my head started to sway in uneasy motions from left to right as the host's voice began to blur out and vertigo settled in. I just needed to turn it down. The voice. Jack. Each word that was uttered I felt like it was drawing the sick straight out of my stomach. I needed to turn it down. And then that's when it happened. That's when it spoke to me. 



 “You touch that dial and i’ll bite off your fuckin’ fingers”



My spine straightened, my blood froze and everything stood still. The wind stopped whistling, my sweat drops slowed in shared disbelief, and the hair on my arms stood up like a dying cat. 



The violent static filled the silence, distorting as the time went on. The base trembled so hard I could feel the vibrations through the floor. It continued



“That's right folks, with a show so good we just had to keep it going. You're still in the Jacks Hour and we have got a very special guest of honour for a very special listener."



I remember it clearly. The weight of his words nailed me in place as I fell to the floor. Seemingly in an instant the temperature raised higher than before as cold sweats drenched my increasingly hotter skin. It's like the room had turned into my very own brazen bull. This next part i dont know how to explain. I know this shit sounds crazy and it is but this is physically hard to type. Look, you need to know that  my mother died when I was young. I was 13 and she had been battling with cancer for a solid year. Even though I knew her before she was diagnosed, that's the only image I can remember of her. Seeing her laying in bed all day, losing her hair and hearing her throw up every night. That's all I can think of when I hear her name. Maybe it's because when she was at her absolute lowest, points that can turn christians into atheists, that's when she showed me how strong she was. Close to death she was still kind, brave and entirely selfless. She showed me how to be brave and endure the fears that life can put upon you. It was hard when she died but it would have been harder if she hadn't been the star she was before she left. Sorry i know it's a lot but i just want you all to know that in no way what happened next was her. She's gone. She's dead. She did not know Jack.

I listened to the conversation that played out. It started with Jack.

“So Mrs Williams you wrote to me a while back when you were suffering with cancer is that correct?”

“Yes, that's correct. A very tough time not just for me but also for my son and dearest husband.”

“Oh poor cas, my condolences. Its grand to see that you're finally back in good health”

“Recovered? Haha, very funny. Of course not silly, how else would I have gotten here? Definitely not by choice that's for sure.”

Laughter broke out between them. A pause smothered the joy as quickly as they started. Static filled the space that silence left. My own mother was talking to Jack. He even said her name. Cassie Williams. It was her. I felt it all. I felt the horror and absurdity and then the pain rushing in as I remember the first time I saw my dad cry as he knelt over my mothers body. I was confused and all i could do was listen okay i didn't run. I didn't want to turn it off anymore. Even if I knew it wasn't her, it was, and she was speaking. To me. 



They carried on. 



“Now. From what I understand when you wrote in. You have a very special message for your son right? He should be listening to this whilst he's at work, yes?”



“Yes, that's correct Jack. First of all I want to address my sweet boy, Harley, directly. *Ahem*, I hope you are okay and know my heart still beats for you and dad.“ with a flattened voice she adds “It can get very lonely down here.” followed by a painful and swift inhale. She continues.

“Nonetheless, I have something I need you to do. You are my very special boy and always have been. You see. When I was diagnosed with cancer it opened a lot of doors and parts of my mind I never explored. Feelings I never felt and moments I could never get back. This was a very troubling time. But… within weakness I found something to comfort me. Through Jack's show I found life a whole lot easier. And so I wrote in. He wrote back and we talked throughout my treatment. I didn't know how I could ever repay Jack for the help and advice he gave me during the toughest part of my life. I never could once my life was over. But you are still alive”



I was speechless. She never ever mentioned anything about her contacting this supposed radio host in the middle of the welsh countryside.  



“Come on baby. Your mother needs you. Please Harl. Just talk to me. Tell me. Tell me you will do this for me. I need you to do this.” Trying to speak felt like trying to keep vomit down. I knew the tension and release would be better than keeping back any words, even ones that made no sense. I wanted my mum to know I heard her. That I love her. The shock of it all kept me back and the closer I got to spilling my guts the more my mother urged me to speak. I don't know how she could see or sense what I was feeling but she knew. Whether that's her motherly instincts or what else I don't know. God. here i am speaking as if it was here. I don't know anymore. But I do know that once I spoke, everything changed. Silence. True silence. Static cut off and the presence of Jack and my mother left. When I heard it. It was silent at first. It was weak. It sounded like the life being squeezed out of a elderly man on his deathbed. Deaths croak.

I could tell after a few seconds that the prolonged groan was Jacks. Even worse  it sounded as if it was coming from the radio. His borderline throat singing, changing pitch in all emotions, echoed against the hollow wood walls of the radio. He got louder and he stopped as quickly and violently as he started. His next words were enough for me to leave. I sprinted and hit each corner as I ran to my car keys and jacket and left. I passed Han who had just arrived and quickly brushed off that I was in a hurry for personal reasons. On the drive home I felt as though my heart was going to rip out of my chest. I could hear the heartbeat and feel it through my fingers as I gripped onto the steering wheel. All of what had happened finally started to settle in. it's as if a fog cleared from my brain as I drove. I realised how fucked up the past ten minutes had been. I miss my mum and I have no idea what happened. I knew it wasn't her she wouldn't sign me up for anything whatever the fuck that even means and she absolutely didn't listen to any show called Jacks Hour. 



When I finally parked outside my house I stayed in the car to catch my breath. I think maybe the adrenaline had blocked out all my senses as I sped back home as my ears adjusted to what was playing from the radio. I heard him. I heard them. I heard screaming. I heard chatter and above all the voices I heard jack. In between his croaking he laughed. The whole drive he had been in my car. Through my radio he taunted me. Just laughing.
