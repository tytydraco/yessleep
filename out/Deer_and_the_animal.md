I have recently moved into a new house. It is rather large but smaller than my last. Other than discrepancies with bats the move has been great. It’s in a neighborhood on the wooded roads. I like to look out the window to watch the cars seem to disappear beyond the trees and reappear seamlessly.

I love living here but I don’t enjoy the wildlife. They never seem to leave. Always staring in curiosity or fear. I have never had a problem with deer but their looks are so eerie I can’t stop looking back until they leave.

One night I had come back from work and heard a bang. Most likely the cracking of a large branch but as I heard it that late it was horrific. I looked around and saw a group of deer just beyond the brush staring with pale eyes from the light. I didn’t move, I couldn’t. They weren’t curious they weren’t afraid. They watch me like how mankind watches them. I was the animal. I was to afraid to go up any closer, I stepped back back into the car. The creatures walked closer to my window. They were right next to me staring into the car inches from me. I was terrified. Their eyes seemed to pierce me. I sat there looking at the car wheel as I was to scared to look into the deers unblinking eyes.

Tap, tap, tap, the deer kept tapping my window with it’s antlers. Does it want me to do something. I couldn’t move. I looked around the car to see if I could drive a way but the car was surrounded in pale cold eyes. I felt so powerless like an animal in cage. I sat there for hours trying not to look but every time I did it got harder to look away. Sometimes they would tilt their heads when I moved. They saw me as nothing but a an exhibit. Why was it different now. Eventually they got tired of my inaction so pressed their head against the car and shook the car back and forth. It shook harder and harder. I couldn’t stay still my head hit the glass a few times until I could get my bearings. They wouldn’t stop. I tried to yell but no sound leapt from my mouth. I kept swaying but they stopped moving the car. The went back to watching. This time I felt like I had to do something. I started juggling some pens. It seemed to interest them. I did this for awhile until finally the sun peeked through the trees and deer simply walking seeming to lose interest in my exhibit.

I haven’t had the experience again but I still see their cold unblinking eyes constantly just within my peripheral vision. I can never shake the feeling of being watched. I tried to find comfort by watching the car pass through the woods again but every time I look out the window at night something is always looking up at me. The cold stare never leaves.
