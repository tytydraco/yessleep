[Last part](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qb0yp3/seven_realms_diner_the_wizard/) / [My whole experience](https://www.reddit.com/user/Practical-Way8041/comments/1ocdy74/the_seven_realms_diner_series/)

I’ve never liked Christmas. I get the appeal, sure. But growing up Christmas was only ever a reminder that there was evil within me. I never got gifts, there was never a celebration, and to top it all off, it took away my only solace: escaping to school for six hours a day––more if I had extracurriculars. It was the only time I was glad about my parents' obsession with keeping up appearances, as the alternative would've been homeschooling.

While other kids got presents, or even coal if they had been bad enough, I only ever got beatings and starvation. The very day school ended for the holidays, I got locked in the damp basement that doubled as a torture room. Of course, that wasn’t the only time a year I was sent there, but it was definitely the most brutal. 

“Jesus was born during this time. It would be an offense to him to let *you* roam free during his birthday,” my parents would say before locking the door behind them. And worst of all, I believed them. Truth be told, lately I’ve been wondering if the mistake was stopping to believe. 

Either way, it’s fair to say that December isn’t my favorite month. And that only a psychopath, or a masochist, would consider paying a visit to their parents on Christmas given the circumstances. 

Suffice it to say, though, I’m neither. I’m just a girl looking for answers. Answers that I’m owed, and I’ll be damned if I don’t get them.  

The idea occurred to me while I was recovering from the effects of the wizard’s tea, but I didn’t dare really consider it until I was sure that I could handle a visit to the place I’d escaped. All it took for that was being witness to another broken familial bond. I’m sure that everybody knows that saying––misery loves company. 

The only other person that knew about the plan was Roger. I didn’t dare whisper a word to Lucien because who knows what he would do once his uncharacteristic bout of protectiveness wore off? (Not that it didn’t work in my favor. He saved my life, and when he tried to turn that into me owing him another favor, I used the fact that he did it because he was enchanted due to his own doing to get out of it.)

And once Roger found out about my plan to visit my parents––my theoretical plan, that is––he insisted that I take him with me so that I wouldn’t be alone. Of course I said no. For more than one reason, and the main one was not that he was still injured. But all of that changed on Christmas Eve. 

“Look, Chris––” the sheriff’s voice echoed from behind Roger’s bedroom door. 

“Roger, dad. My name is Roger,” the man muttered through gritted teeth. 

“Roger,” the sheriff conceded. “I’m sorry, I slip up sometimes.” There was a pause. “I know you don’t want to come home for Christmas. And you know that I don’t give a fuck either way, but it’ll break your mother’s heart if you don’t come.”

“I can’t,” was the only answer given. 

I was expecting for the sheriff to continue the fight. It’s something of a dance between them, or at least it had been before Roger’s injury. Now the sheriff lets his son get away with much more than before. 

Instead, he just came out of the room and slammed the door shut behind him. It took him a moment to see me there, obviously staring at the him. In my defense, so would you. So shut up. Luckily, Christopher––the sheriff, I just realized that I’ve never told you his name before––thought that it was because of the plastic cup that hit the wall right next to his head. 

Just because the ghost was ok with one werewolf being in the house, it doesn’t mean that he’s ok with two of them. At least this time it was a plastic cup and not another bowl. I’ve already lost count of how many we’ve had to replace. 

“Oh, Susan,” the sheriff smiled. That was another thing that changed after our visit to faerie. The sheriff doesn’t hate me anymore. He shot a quick glance at his back before approaching me. “Can I ask you a favor?” He whispered. 

“Sure,” I replied also in a whisper. 

“He listens to you. He really does,” he said, but I looked at him skeptically. “At least more than he does to me.” That part was true. 

“What can I do to help you then?” I asked. 

“I would really appreciate it if you could get him to come home for Christmas,” he started. “His mother has been hounding me about it for weeks.”

“I—I’ll see what I can do,” I said. Truth be told, I already knew that it would be a lost battle. Mrs Woolf wasn’t the only person hounding, after all. The sheriff had spent the previous few weeks hounding Roger as well, and I myself was witness to many of the refusals. But I felt like I owed the sheriff after he kept my secret. 

I wasn’t sure why Roger didn’t want to go. Sure, his relationship with his parents––especially his father––wasn’t the best. But the few interactions between mother and son were perfectly harmonious. Not to talk about his relationship with his sister. If you think that I get into trouble a lot, you should see what these two can accomplish together. 

Either way, I wasn’t about to deny the sheriff his request. Not when he had just started to like tolerate me. 

“You’re welcome too, of course,” he added. “Clarise would have my head if I let you be alone on Christmas Day.

I smiled awkwardly at that. Just like Roger, I didn’t have much intention to celebrate Christmas. And you already know the reason for that. 

After our unusual conversation the sheriff just nodded and left the house. 

It took me a while to collect my thoughts enough to go into Roger’s room, and since I was already in the kitchen I decided to bring him a snack. This is a great tip for anybody reading this. If you have to interact with a werewolf, bringing them food is bound to get you in their good graces. Unless they want you as the meal. I have no tips for that situation––none of the werewolves I’ve met have ever tried to eat anyone. At least not in front of me. 

I knocked softly on the door in case he was asleep. He did that a lot lately, which if you remember from my house hunting debacle is not usual for his kind. But I was assured that it was completely normal during the healing process, and now that his wound was mostly healed that was becoming a much rarer occurrence. 

I’ve been witness to Christopher begging Roger to transform more than I’m willing to admit, since   id he did, he would’ve been completely healed already. And once the healing process is over, his muscles will never regenerate as they would through transformation, and the damage will become permanent. 

But still, Roger was unable to access his werewolf form. And he always changes the topic when I ask him about it. It drove me crazy, honestly, how everybody in town seemed to know this secret that I didn’t. But I was resolved to allow him his privacy just as he did with me when it comes to my life before coming to Monsterville. 

When he told me to come in I did so, and I immediately laid down on the bed next to him. He was watching a movie on his 88 inch tv––which his parents had gifted him. Honestly, the sheriff may try to portray his discontent with his son, but if one thing is true it’s that he’s really spoiled. Either way, the movie was one of my favorites, so I laid down to watch it with him. 

After a few minutes of silence, I finally decided to broach the topic. 

“So…” I started, and he instantly groaned. I was sure that he knew what was coming next. “Why did your dad call you Chris?”

He side-eyed me before answering. “That’s my middle name,” he admitted. “Christopher, just like him.” He laughed bitterly. “It was my father’s way of naming me his heir. The expectation of following in his footsteps came right along with that.”

“Hmmm,” I mused. Another juicy piece of the puzzle that I would have to get back to in the future. “That must’ve been tough.”

“He asked you to get me to go, didn’t he?”

“Maybe,” I said, looking away from him. 

He sighed. “It’s not really them,” he said as he grabbed the remote and paused the movie. “It’s Christmas.”

“What do you mean?”

“I lost someone important to me on that day,” he murmured as tears began to well up in his eyes. 

“I’m sorry,” I said placing a hand on his arm. I looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to say more, but he didn’t. 

“I don’t like Christmas either,” I tried to continue the conversation. And I’m sure that I must be the worst person in the entire universe right now, because I was kind of glad that he didn’t like Christmas either. “My––My parents,” I continued, forcing the words out. This is the first time I’ve ever admitted this to anyone in person, and my tongue felt like sandpaper as I said what I wanted to say. “Used to–– to lock me in the basement for two weeks straight once school was over. And every day I would be beat, and starved. And every night I would be made to stand awake holding heavy books on my head.”

I kept staring at the bed, and I didn’t dare look up, certain that I would find only horror in his expression. 

“What?” He exclaimed. 

I laughed nervously. “I’m sure you can see why I don’t like them much. But.” No, I’m not proud of what I did here. “Your parents are not like mine at all. They love you so much, and I’m sure that all of these expectations must’ve weighed heavily on you, but it’s clear that they want to spend time with you. And maybe even make sure that you’re not alone on a day of such importance to you. Not everyone can say that.”

Roger clenched his jaw. “Susan,” he warned, but he stopped once he met my eyes. My words had begun as a dirty trick to get him home for Christmas, but at that moment I realized that I’d meant them. I wasn’t adamant on following through with the sheriff’s request because I felt indebted to him. I did it because a part of me wished that I had the same option as him. It was a harsh realization that I’d actually meant what I said. And, even though Roger was not privy to my thoughts, he was able to see that I’d started crying. 

His gaze softened. “I can’t.” Those were his only words. A new thought occurred to me then. 

“Let’s make a deal,” I said. He immediately made a move to say no, but the apprehension in my face must’ve triggered his curiosity. “You can come to my parent’s house with me,” I took a deep breath before the next words. Even thinking about going back to that place sends shivers down my spine. I can’t believe that it had only been a little over two months since I ran away––everything I’ve endured in there feels like it happened decades ago. But at the same time, they feel like yesterday. “And after that, I’ll go to your parents’ house with you.”

“How can you ever think about going there?” He asked, furious. “I knew you had it bad. Nobody runs away because they’re happy, but that’s worse than I’d ever imagined.”

I laughed at that. “There’s more to that too.” He didn’t find my words as funny as I did. “I don’t want to go there. I’d rather cut off my own arm that go there if I had any other option. But I don’t anymore. You know what the wizard said about me. About the evil within me,” I shook my head to get rid of the unshed tears in my eyes. “I’ve spent my whole life being told about it. I didn’t understand a word until now, but they definitely know something about what I am.” I hesitated before I said the next words. “How else would they know I’m evil?”

“First of all,” he growled. “If you’re evil, then I’m a villain. And second…” it looked like he didn’t have anything else planned, because he took a second to continue. “You’re right,” he deflated. “We need to find answers soon. Before someone else intent on killing you finds out.”

Something warm lit inside me when he used the word ‘we.’ I still wasn’t used to being cared about. 

“So? Do we have a deal?”

He fake-whimpered. “Fine. I can’t have you meeting your jailers on you own,” he joked. “If going to Christmas with my parents is what allows me to go with you, I’ll have to endure it.” His words were harsh, but the smile on his face was genuine. As was the worry in his furrowed eyebrows, but I chose to ignore that part. 

After our bonding moment, I decided to push my luck. “I told you in great detail why *I* hate Christmas. It would be only fair for you to share too,” I only half-joked, bumping his shoulder with mine. 

He bit his lips from the inside. “I think it’s about time too.” He got up from bed and I followed him as he limped to the kitchen. “But it’s a long story.” He put the kettle on as he invited me to sit on one of the chairs. 

“Did you know that my father is the alpha of the town’s pack?” He asked once he had poured both of us a cup of tea and he’d sat opposite to me. I accepted the cup, but my new-found aversion to tea didn’t allow me to actually drink it. 

I nodded at his words. 

“Well, I was supposed to be the alpha after him,” Roger’s tone was bitter. “He was so proud when I was born with the alpha gene.”

“But then you couldn’t transform,” I guessed. 

Roger closed his eyes and his shoulders dropped. “But then I screwed up and now I can’t transform,” he corrected me. 

“What happened?” I pushed. 

“Have you ever read a werewolf book?” He asked me, and I just shook my head. That type of literature was more than forbidden in my house. Once I tried to read a vampire book at school without my parents knowing. But somehow, they did. And trust me, I never made the same mistake again. 

Roger regarded me with suspicion, like he didn’t believe me. “Well, in most of them werewolves have this thing called a mate.”

“Ok, I knew *that* part.” I interrupted. He looked at me with annoyance but continued anyway. 

“Well, the books aren’t entirely incorrect.” 

My eyes widened. But he begged me not to interrupt because recounting the story was too painful for him. He just needed to get it out. 

“And notice that I said ‘entirely,’ not ‘at all,’” he continued. “Only alphas have the ability to mate.”

“Is your mom your dad’s mate?” Sorry. I couldn’t help myself. 

“Yes,” he said giving me a dirty look. “Do you want me to continue the story now?”

“Sorry,” I nodded. 

“I was eighteen years old when I met mine,” he said. My eyes widened but I kept quiet. “Her name was Lyla, and she was barely one year older than me,” he smiled absentmindedly. “We spent every hour of the day together, and sometimes even the night. My parents didn’t approve of her though. At all. They knew it couldn’t be helped, but neither could their prejudice. Because… because she was a vampire.”

“She was what?!” I exclaimed. And don’t you dare judge me, you all knew I wouldn’t be able to keep my mouth shut for too long. 

“Just wait until I tell you about her family,” he teased after narrowing his eyes at me. I went back to being quiet. “We were married within the year. Nobody was surprised, really. That’s how mate relations work. Her brother was irate, but even he knew that there was nothing he could do short of killing me. And nobody wants to start an inter-species war,” at that moment Roger saw that I was about to interrupt again. “I’ll get to her family later, you flea,” he teased. 

I just shrugged. 

“We went to a small town in France for our honeymoon, and we booked a small house in a clearing far away from civilization. We thought that we had the rest of our lives ahead of us.” He bit his lip and grabbed the kettle to boil some more water. We stood in silence for a while, waiting for him to be able to get the rest of the words out. 

Once he’d poured himself another cup, he spoke again. “We had two full days of bliss until two vampire hunters came into town. Most of them are the result of human-vampire relations, typically male vampire and human woman. Their offspring aren’t vampires, but they aren’t completely human either. Some enhanced senses, slightly longer lifespan. And an unmatched ability to detect the vampire kind. And they can go unnoticed by all of us.”

I knew where this was going. 

“They attacked us in the middle of the night, on Christmas,” he winced. “We don’t sleep much. Either of us, but that night we were sleeping. And they just barged in.” He had tears in his eyes now. “I managed to transform, and I killed one of them. But the other one already had a stake in Lyla’s heart.”

“I haven’t been able to change ever since,” he admitted. “They call it a psychological block. According to… the wizard,” he winced.  “I feel like I don’t deserve my wolf form because I wasn’t able to save her,” he was extremely bitter then. “It’s quite common, I’m told.”

I didn’t know what to say. A simple sorry didn’t seem like enough. 

“I’m so sorry,” I said grabbing his hand. It wasn’t enough, I was right. But it was the beginning. 

Roger smiled at me. “She was my only. And now I have to spend the rest of my life alone. Worst of all, my father’s disappointment is the worst part of it all. Everything reminds him that I’m his failure of a son that can’t even transform anymore.”

“No. Absolutely not. You’re not a disappointment or a failure Roger. You are strong, and kind. And you care deeply about your family and friends. That’s not a disappointment by my standards. Not in the slightest. ”

“I think,” he said slowly, “that Lyla would’ve liked you.”

“I would’ve liked her too,” I said. And I was sure of that. 

“Anyway,” he shook my grasp off of him and smiled a broken smile. “On a less painful, but still equally grueling topic, Lyla was Silas’ sister.”

“What?!” I screamed so loud that I even startled the ghost. 

For the rest of the morning I kept pestering him with questions, but for the sake of brevity, these are the most remarkable answers: 

1. Lyla was Silas’ younger sister, but he wouldn’t tell me much else since he felt like it wasn’t his place to explain vampire familial relations and hierarchy to me. I made a note to ask Lucien about all of that later. 
2. Silas blamed Roger for his sister’s death. He felt like Roger broke his promise to protect her that he made when they married. He wanted to kill him for that offense, but Lucien forbade it. “Yet another reason for Silas to hate him,” Roger said. Another thing I would have to ask Lucy. (I have yet to call him to his face by that name, as one of you suggested, but I’m working up the courage to that.)

With all of this new information, both of us decided that postponing the inevitable was useless, so we decided to leave as soon as possible. The sooner we left, the sooner I wouldn’t have to see my parents ever again. 

I wish I could say that I’d thought everything through. But if I had, I may have never actually had the nerve to move. We had to take advantage of the afternoon shift, since we’d have to cross the in-between, and Linda would be the one working both the morning, the night, and all the shifts the following day. Therefore, we only had a limited time frame to go in and out unnoticed. 

My journey to Monsterville when I escaped home took over two days. I was exhausted, filthy, and had no idea of where I was. The journey from Monsterville to home took us twenty minutes. It turns out that there is a Seven Realms in my home town––which led to the theory that maybe that’s where I came from? I don’t know, but this was as good a theory as any. 

At my behest, Roger was waiting behind me as I fidgeted on the front steps of my parents’ home. The idea of answers was a tempting one. But standing in front of their door about to go back into the place I’d promised myself never to return to, I wondered if answers were worth the trouble. 

I was psyching myself up, gathering the courage to knock on the door, when the preparation became entirely futile. The door opened on its own. 

In that moment, standing in front of my father’s frame I realized how wrong I’d been. How did I ever think that I would be able to face them without regressing to that scared girl that ran away? How did I ever thing that I would be able to win?

“Susan?” He exclaimed. There was surprise in his expression, sure. And if you knew him as well as I do, you could’ve even seen the slightest hint of relief. However, all of that was expertly hidden behind a mask of unadulterated fury and rage. 

I took a step back, putting some distance between us. 

“What the hell are you doing here, girl?” He spat, hatred spilling from every word. He didn’t even acknowledge my companion. “We’ve been looking everywhere for you, you wretched girl.” He lounged toward me and I flinched as his thick hand closed around my bicep. 

He pulled me toward the house while hurling insults at my person. Suddenly, I was once again 12 years old and I’d just been caught sneaking food into my room. I knew what was coming next. The basement. The chains. I’d almost forgotten that I wasn’t alone anymore. 

Roger stepped between us, making use of his inhuman strength to pry my father’s hand off me. 

My father attempted to push Roger off the steps, but even an injured werewolf was no match for a human. He tried to regain his composure after his failure. “And who the hell are you? Are you the whore’s little boyfriend?” He snickered. 

Roger didn’t reply. Instead, he growled, showing his teeth to my father. 

“I see,” he sneered before turning his attention back to me. “So this is the company you’ve been keeping lately. I wish I could say that I was surprised, but we’ve always known you were rotten from within.”

I didn’t say anything. I was completely intimidated by his presence. I didn’t even have the mind to think about this then, but now I realize that if I hadn’t brought Roger with me, everything would’ve been over right then and there. 

“How extremely rude of you, *human,*” Roger said, the last word laced with venom. “Is that how you treat your guests?”

I’d never seen that side of Roger before, but it brought me no small amount of satisfaction to see my father’s face blanch at the werewolf’s thinly veiled threat. It took me much too long to realize that this was the confirmation I needed to understand that they’ve known about the secret world of inhumans all along. All that was left was seeing what they knew about me. 

In an uncharacteristic gesture of submission, my father lowered his head and stepped aside, gesturing for us to come in. I didn’t realize how hard I was gripping roger’s forearm until we had to move. But I still didn’t let go. 

“Thank you,” I whispered to him once we were out of my father’s range of hearing. I led us to the small living room at the back of the house, making sure not to gaze at the shelf that hid the door to the basement. 

My father followed us in, calling for my mother to join us. 

“Rosalind, dear,” he shouted. “Come join us in the living room. We have some guests.”

We waited in silence for my mother to appear while I tried to imagine what Roger was thinking. Did he notice the stark difference between this house and the rest of the houses on the street? Did he realize that this one was not decorated? Did he realize that all festive cheer had vanished once we’d stepped inside?

He must’ve, I reasoned. His brows were furrowed and his lips thin. Was he angry? Worried? Something else?

Looking at him instead of thinking about what I was doing helped ease my anxiety a little bit, as I knew that the worst was yet to come. My father was a stern man. But his severity couldn’t hold a candle to my mother’s. 

A few moments later my mother stepped into the room. She was a small woman, barely 5 feet in height. And, when she stood right next to my 6’3 father, she looked like a little doll. However, this comparison did nothing to stop my blood turning to ice when she came in. 

Her annoyed leer scanned the room. She was no doubt expecting to see someone else. A group of carolers, perhaps. Insolent enough to dare take her away from her chores. Stupid kids that had not yet leant that her house was off limits on Christmas. She looked, as usual, ready to let them learn how mistaken they had been. 

But, when her eyes landed on me, her expression became that of complete indifference. She’s always been skilled at looking at me like that. A pang of hurt washed over me when I realized that I was expecting to see something else in there. Not love, of course. Never love. But even anger would’ve sufficed. Instead, she looked at me like I was a piece of gum stuck to her shoe. 

“So,” she said coolly, eyes sweeping over me from head to toe. “You decided to crawl back.” Her gaze lingered on me for a moment longer before shifting to Roger. Another small pang of hurt hit me when she regarded him with surprise. She was my mother, but she only had emotions for everybody else. 

She didn’t address him, though. 

“Let’s get this over with,” she ordered. “You were insolent enough to bring one of these––“ she  pointed to Roger with her head––“filthy creatures into my house. So this had better be important.”

I couldn’t say a word. I felt like a deer caught in headlights until Roger nudged me. 

I took a shaky breath to steady myself before remembering how impatient my mother was. 

“Speak!” She shouted. 

“I––I came here for answers,” I said, and my mother raised one eyebrow. “I know you’ve always hated me.” I took the courage to utter these words thanks to Roger’s presence. I would’ve never been able to speak them otherwise. “And I need to know why. I need to know what you know about me.”

I wish I could say that there was shock in their eyes. Instead, there was only anger in my father’s and, surprisingly, sorrow in my mother’s. That’s when I knew that at least her reaction wasn’t directed at me. 

“Fine,” she spit out, sitting on the leather armchair opposite to the sofa Roger and I were on. “You should know how wretched you’ve been since before you were born anyway.”

I could feel Roger tensing up, but he was making a herculean effort to keep his mouth shut. 

My father shot me one last look of contempt before walking away, leaving us alone with my mother. 

 “It’s a relief to finally tell you this, you know.” A cruel smile spread through her face. “It’s about time you knew I would’ve never been willing to bring a pest like you to this world.”

Her words didn’t sting. I was used to them. But they still surprised me somehow. 

“My fool of a daughter did,” she said. Her voice was shaky, and I could see the beginning of tears forming in her eyes. I’d never seen her cry before. 

“W––What?” I asked. 

“Did you think I really was you mother?” She sniffed. “I thank god every day for not making you mine. If only Diane had had that luck,” she mocked. 

“You are my daughter’s bastard child. You killed her when you were born. And yes, we knew that you were born a monster.” She said after she put her mask of indifference back in place. 

Every remark felt like a being stabbed with a dull knife. 

“No, I have no idea who your monster of a father was. She wouldn’t say,” she continued. “All I know about what you are, is that you are a pest. A plague to this world. And that I should’ve been rid of you long ago. I should’ve killed you the moment I realized what you were.”

I nodded, holding my tears in. She hated it when I cried. 

“That’s enough!” Roger intervened. 

“It is,” she agreed. “I want you out of my house. NOW.”

I flinched at her tone, but Roger grabbed me by the arm and pulled me toward the exit. 

But our way was blocked by my father, who was smiling for the first time ever that day. I was too absorbed in my own thoughts to realize why that was. 

In his hands, he was holding a net made out of iron. The same net that he had sometimes used to torture me with. Making me endure its weight while trying to stay upright. But this time, I was not his intended victim. Roger was. 

But our way was blocked by my father, who was smiling for the first time ever that day. I was too absorbed in my own thoughts to realize why that was. 

In his hands, he was holding a net made out of iron. The same net that he had sometimes used to punish me with. Making me endure its weight while trying to stay upright. But this time, I was not his intended victim. Roger was. 

My father threw the net over the werewolf, and Roger collapsed instantly under it. 

If he’d been completely healthy, he may’ve been able to endure it. But his still weak body was no rival to so much iron. 

“No!” I screamed. At the same time my mother wrapped her arms around me, making sure that I couldn’t jump to Roger’s aid. 

She held me in place as I thrashed, while Roger’s own resistance steadily weakened. It didn’t take long before the werewolf went limp, unconscious beneath the iron net.

Only then did my mother release me.

I spun around to face her. “Why did you do that?” I yelled. 

She smiled sweetly, although it didn’t reach her eyes. “He would’ve only been a nuisance,” she shrugged. 

Suddenly, I screamed. 

Burning agony washed over my body as I fell. 

It took me little time to realize why it was. While I was distracted, my father had released unconscious Roger from the net, and had trapped me beneath it instead. 

The iron pressed into my skin like it was alive. 

Every breath felt like I was dragging air through mud. My limbs trembled uselessly beneath the weight, my strength leaking out of me as if the iron itself was drinking it.

So this was what Roger had meant when I first got to Monsterville. 

Just being near it was enough to make you feel powerless. 

I tried to move. My arms shook violently before collapsing back against the floor. The iron burned hotter in response, as if punishing me for even thinking about resistance.

Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw my mother walking to Roger. 

“Leave him alone!” I managed to grunt. She didn’t listen to me. 

My mother shoved her hands into her apron’s pockets and pulled them back out, scattering a purple flower over Roger’s unmoving body.

I started screaming.

From the pain. From the fear. From everything. 

But she didn’t even look at me.

“I’ll be with you in a second, Susan.” Her tone was stern. “I’m just making sure that his nap is permanent.”

Her words should’ve made me scared. But instead, relief washed over me.

I recognized the flower she had in her hands. 

Apparently, she didn’t know as much about inhumans as she claimed to. 

She was sprinkling wolfsbane on Roger, hoping that, as the name suggests, they would kill him. She didn’t know that it only made werewolves stronger.

I felt some relief knowing that at least Roger would live. 

When she was done, she whipped around to meet me. 

“I should’ve killed you as a baby, yes,” she said calmly, stepping toward me. “That much is true. But now is better than never. You will die under that iron. In agony, just like my daughter died in agony.”

Panic surged in my chest. I sucked in a breath and immediately regretted it as the iron constricted tighter. 

I didn’t want to die. Especially not like this. 

But I could feel the strength leaving my body second by second. It terrified me to the core. 

“I knew that boy was trouble from the moment she brought him home,” my mother mused, sitting on the couch. 

I tried raising one arm, but I couldn’t even manage that. I couldn’t even raise one finger, that’s how weak I was. 

I couldn’t even sob. My tears just fell silently down my face, offering some relief from the burning sting of the iron. 

“And then she came to me crying,” she continued. “Sobbing. Begging me to forgive her because she was pregnant. We instantly knew that there was something wrong with you. The amniotic sack too thick. The skin too thick.” Venom spilled from her every word. “Not even the ultrasound could reach you.”

By then, I could barely hold my eyes open, but I forced myself to listen. 

“She died pushing you out. And then she begged me to look after you. I—”

Her voice was lulling me to sleep. Not even the pain could keep me awake. Only the panic in my chest did. 

It took me a second to realize that she’d stopped talking. And it wasn’t because she was done, but because from beside me, Roger had begun shaking. 

His eyes snapped open. 

Ire shone in his them as growls rippled through his body. He rose to his feet, howling, and suddenly his eyes shone crimson instead of his usual green, or the yellow that I’d grown accustomed to when he was angry. 

My mother screamed in terror, jumping to her feet. But genetics gave us one thing in common. Fear makes us freeze. 

I was shaking too, though I’m not sure if from fear or pain, when terror seized me again. But this time, it was directed to Roger’s wellbeing. 

His body twisted violently, his spine folding in half as the top part of his body folded over the bottom half. 

Then, he came upright again, but every bone in his arms and legs snapped audibly before my eyes. 

Lost in my terror, thinking that he really was dying after all, I didn’t realize at first that in Roger’s place stood a silver-coated wolf growling menacingly at my mother. 

From behind him, my father ran away in the other direction. Not a care in the world for what would happen to his wife. 

Roger lunged at her, closing his maw around her leg. 

She screamed, trying to get away. But, in the end, she passed out. If it was from pain, fear, or shock, I didn’t know. 

“Please,” I begged the wolf, hoping that Roger was still somewhere in there. He was about to kill my mother––grandmother?––and I didn’t want that. For some reason, after everything, I didn’t want her to die. “Don’t kill her.”

He growled, but stepped aside, acknowledging my words with a nod. In an instant, his fur receded and Roger’s human form stood in front of me again. 

“You shifted!” I exclaimed. But my voice was weak. 

He smiled tightly before grabbing the net on top of me with his bare hands. He hissed as he chucked it to the side like it was made out of paper. “What happened?” I asked, but he didn’t tell me. 

“Later,” he spat, holding me upright. 

I saw some hesitation on his face for a moment before he instantly turned into a wolf again. He gestured for me to get on him, like on a horse, and I was too unstable on my feet to refuse. 

The moment I was steady on his back, he sprung forward and reached a speed that rivaled that of Lucien’s when he was using his vampiric one. I clung to him forcefully, unwilling to open my eyes until we stopped what felt like an eternity later. 

I was so focused on not falling off that I didn’t even feel the prickling sensation of coming into the in-between until I noticed that we were no longer moving and that my wounds had started healing. 

While we stood there waiting for the iron’s effects to wane enough to allow me to walk on my own, Roger finally answered some questions. 

The effects of the wolfsbane counteracted those of the iron, that’s why he was able to get rid of it. As for how he transformed, he told me that he felt that same helplessness as he did the night Lyla died. He couldn’t watch someone else he cared about die. 

And yes, thanks to him transforming, his leg has now completely healed, save a scar that he will have forever due to delayed healing. 

We walked home in silence, and although Roger wanted to comfort me, I needed to be alone that night. To revel in the fact that I was alive. 

On Christmas morning, Lucien banged on our door demanding answers and I reluctantly recounted the events of the previous day to him. I don’t know what happened to my parents after that. I didn’t ask. I must really be wicked, because as long as it didn’t happen in front of me, I didn’t care. 

Once Roger woke up from his well-deserved sleep, I was already ready to leave for his parents’ house. 

“You don’t have to come with me, you know,” he told me. “Nobody would begrudge you some rest.”

“A promise is a promise,” I teased. 

“I wouldn’t dare hold it against you,” he replied, horrified. 

“I know,” I laughed. “I want to go.” It took me by surprise to realize that I really meant it. 

So, we went to his home. His parents and his sister embraced me. It was warm, and cozily decorated. 

We ate, and we drank, and I received a present for the first time ever. I made plans to hang out with his sister Alice. And his mother offered to teach me how to bake the delicious cupcakes that we had for dessert. 

For once in my whole life, I allowed myself to feel loved. To feel like I belonged. On that day, I was loved and cherished. And I think that I finally discovered what it feels like to be a part of a family. Even if it’s not the one that I was born into.

I didn’t get what I wanted from my visit to my parents. I still don’t know what I am. But at least I’m alive. Hurt, yes. But alive. And that’s all that matters for right now. 

And finally, I realized that human beings can sometimes be the worst monsters of all.
