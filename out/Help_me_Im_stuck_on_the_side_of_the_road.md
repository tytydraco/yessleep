I’m writing this in the daylight, not because it feels safer, exactly, but because I’ve stopped trusting my own thinking once the sun goes down.  
  
Last night I was driving home on a two-lane highway I’ve taken a hundred times. No streetlights. No traffic. Just that narrow, tunneled feeling you get when the world reduces itself to your headlights and the painted line in the road, like everything else has been switched off.  
  
The steering started to feel off. Nothing dramatic. No sudden pull. Just… soft. Like the front end didn’t want to stay honest, didn’t want to track straight unless I kept correcting it.  
  
I told myself I’d deal with it when I got home. I was tired. I didn’t feel like pulling over in the dark.  
  
Then my brain did what it always does and jumped straight to the worst version of things: a blown tire at highway speed, the car fishtailing, me sliding into a ditch so fast I wouldn’t even have time to be scared.  
  
So I pulled over.  
  
Hazards on. Slow, controlled movement. Half on the shoulder, half on the line—the kind of parking job that says I’m not staying long and I don’t want to die here.  
  
I stopped. Exhaled. Sat there longer than I meant to, my hands still on the wheel, listening to the engine tick down.  
  
Then I checked the rearview mirror.  
  
And my stomach dropped.  
  
There was no road behind me.  
  
Not “it’s too dark to see.”  
Not “my headlights aren’t reaching far enough.”  
  
The road itself was gone.  
  
The asphalt just… stopped at the back of my car, like someone had taken a knife and cleanly cut the highway in half. Everything in front of me was still there. Everything behind me wasn’t.  
  
Behind my trunk was wet grass, then trees. Too close. Uncomfortably close. Like the forest began exactly where my bumper ended.  
  
I blinked hard. Leaned forward. Tilted my head, as if changing the angle might somehow fix the problem.  
  
It didn’t.  
  
I got out of the car.  
  
Cold air. Dead quiet. The hazards clicking steadily, like a metronome keeping time for something I didn’t want to think about. Red light pulsing across the bumper and the grass, again and again.  
  
I walked to the back of the car and stared at the edge of the pavement up close, stupidly thinking it might make more sense from a few feet away.  
  
It didn’t.  
  
The pavement ended in a clean, sharp line. No taper. No gravel shoulder. No ditch. Just asphalt, then dirt.  
  
I crouched and touched the edge with my fingers. It felt real. Rough. Sharp in a way roads aren’t supposed to be, like it hadn’t been worn down by tires or weather or time.  
  
Past that edge was a drop into black.  
  
Not a ditch.  
Not a ravine.  
  
Just a depth that didn’t belong there.  
  
I picked up a small rock from the shoulder and tossed it out into the darkness, feeling ridiculous even as I did it.  
  
I waited for the sound.  
  
Nothing.  
  
No thud. No bounce. No echo. No splash.  
  
Just silence, like the world swallowed it before it could finish falling.  
  
I stood up too fast and got that faint, floaty feeling—not in my body, exactly, but somewhere higher up. Like my brain didn’t like what it was seeing and started quietly looking for a way out.  
  
I pulled my phone from my pocket.  
  
No service. Of course.  
  
I opened Maps anyway. The blue dot took a second to load, then settled.  
  
It placed me in the middle of the woods.  
  
Not on the highway.  
Not even near it.  
  
Just trees.  
  
I zoomed out. The highway was still there on the map—a clean, uninterrupted line stretching back toward town. My dot sat off to the side, buried in green, like I’d driven straight into the forest.  
  
I tried calling 911.  
  
It rang once.  
  
Then someone picked up.  
  
No greeting. No introduction. Just breathing on the line.  
  
I said, “Hi. I pulled over on the highway. Something’s wrong. The road behind me is gone.”  
  
There was a pause. Not long, but long enough to feel like the person was deciding what category to put me in.  
  
Then a voice, calm and flat.  
  
“Are you in a safe location?”  
  
I glanced back at the cut edge of pavement and the trees pressed tight behind my car.  
  
“No.”  
  
“Is there anyone else with you?”  
  
“No.”  
  
“Stay where you are.”  
  
The way it said it made my skin tighten. It didn’t sound like advice. It sounded procedural. Final.  
  
I said, “Can you ping my location? My map says I’m in the woods and I’m… clearly not.”  
  
Silence. Not long, but it had that weird weight—like the breath before someone says something they know won’t help.  
  
Then the voice came back, quieter now, like they’d leaned in too close:  
  
“Don’t turn around.”  
  
I blinked. “I’m—what?”  
  
There was a click. Not the hang-up kind. Just... a sound. Could’ve been anything, honestly.  
  
Then again, that same tone. Still flat:  
  
“Stay where you are.”  
  
I hung up.  
  
I told myself it was a tired operator. A glitch. Someone working a long shift who didn’t know what to say. Anything normal.  
  
Then I heard gravel shift behind me.  
  
Not a branch.  
Not an animal.  
  
A step.  
  
Careful. Deliberate. Like someone placing their foot down slowly to avoid making noise.  
  
I froze. Keys in one hand. Phone in the other. My hazards kept blinking.  
  
On.  
Off.  
On.  
Off.  
  
Every time the red light washed over the trees, nothing was there.  
  
In the dark between blinks, I heard it again.  
  
Another step.  
  
Perfectly timed with the hazards going dark.  
  
Like it understood the rhythm.  
  
I got back into the car so fast I slammed my knee into the door frame. Locked the doors. Started the engine.  
  
The dashboard lit up, small and bright and familiar, like a tiny safe room.  
  
I checked the rearview mirror.  
  
Still no road.  
  
Just trees.  
  
And an outline standing where the shoulder should have been.  
  
It wasn’t detailed. No face. No features. Just a human shape my eyes kept trying—and failing—to focus on.  
  
When the hazards blinked on, it vanished in the red glare.  
  
When they blinked off, it was there again.  
  
It was like it—whatever it was—needed that blink.  
Like the moment no one was watching, it took a breath and stood up straighter.  
  
I threw the car into drive.  
  
Not gently.  
  
The tires spun on loose gravel, then caught, and the car lurched forward onto the highway.  
  
I drove.  
  
The road ahead was normal. The lines stayed put. Reflectors blinked back like they always had.  
  
But behind me, the rearview stayed wrong.  
  
The darkness moved with me.  
  
Not like something chasing.  
  
Like a mouth closing.  
  
The cut edge of pavement stayed the same distance behind my bumper, erasing the road as I went.  
  
I kept checking the mirror, even though I knew better. Every time I looked, the space felt tighter. Smaller. Like my past was being deleted in real time.  
  
My phone buzzed in the cup holder.  
  
Once.  
Twice.  
Three times.  
  
Still no service—but it buzzed like it wanted attention.  
  
I didn’t look.  
  
Then headlights appeared ahead.  
  
Relief hit me so hard my eyes burned.  
  
An oncoming car. A real person. Proof.  
  
I flashed my brights.  
  
The car slowed.  
  
Then slowed more.  
  
Then stopped in the opposite lane, facing me.  
  
It didn’t pull over. It didn’t turn around.  
  
It just waited.  
  
As I got closer, I saw why it felt wrong.  
  
There was no driver.  
  
Empty seats. No silhouette. No movement.  
  
When my hazards blinked on, the car looked solid.  
  
When they blinked off, it felt unstable—like the idea of a car, not the thing itself.  
  
I passed it without stopping.  
  
My phone lit up again. Somehow, it had one bar now. Maybe it was lying.  
  
A message blinked through from a number I didn’t know.  
  
TURN AROUND. YOU DROPPED SOMETHING.  
  
My stomach rolled. It was too on-the-nose. Too… tailored.  
  
Then another.  
  
YOUR TAILLIGHT IS OUT.  
  
It wasn’t.  
  
Then a third.  
  
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.  
  
I threw the phone onto the passenger seat.  
  
The highway curved ahead—one I recognized. My turnoff should’ve been right there.  
  
It wasn’t.  
  
Instead, there was a new sign. Clean. Reflective.  
  
One word:  
  
RETURN  
  
I drove past it.  
  
The moment I did, my rearview mirror went flat black. Not dark. Not unlit.  
  
Just black.  
  
I didn’t slow down.  
  
I drove until streetlights appeared. Until I saw another car with a human inside it. Until a lifted truck rode my bumper and flashed his lights.  
  
I’ve never been happier to be tailgated.  
  
When I got home, I shut the engine off and sat there, hazards still clicking.  
  
Then I turned them off.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
This morning I found a nail in my tire. Ordinary.  
  
But there was damp soil stuck to my rear bumper. Leaves pressed into the plastic like I’d backed into the forest.  
  
I didn’t.  
  
And I haven’t driven that highway since.  
  
If you have to pull over at night, do it somewhere bright. Somewhere with people.  
  
Don’t stop on a dark shoulder.  
  
And if you do—and the road behind you is missing—don’t stand there trying to understand it.  
  
Get back in the car.  
  
Keep moving.  
  
Because whatever that thing was, it didn’t care about the stuff people usually lose. Not the phone. Not the wallet. Not the keys.  
  
I think it wanted the moment. The pause. The part of me that hesitated. That chose to stop.
