After I had the brief talk with the copycat, I went back to Harp to make sure she was alright. She had had some time to think about our relationship. She wanted to remain friends if possible. I didn’t have the heart to tell her about the thoughts brewing inside my head. I thanked her and promised we would talk again soon, well aware that I was ready to break that promise.  

I headed back to Evie’s place. Her cut wasn’t as bad as it looked after she cleaned it up. I still fussed over her feeling guilty; she’ll now have a scar cutting through her eyebrow. She claimed it would make her look cool and that she wouldn't worry.   

“My birthday is coming up. Normally, I don’t make a big deal over it, but Lucas wants us to have a get-together. It's in two weeks, so we hope the house is fixed up by then. You need to be there or else Lucas will be upset.” Evie explained.  

We were sitting on her couch alone. August was watching over Lucas and April and had fallen asleep. She hadn’t gotten much since the fire, so we let her get some rest.   

I nodded again, making a promise I wasn’t expecting to go through with.  

“How old are you going to be? Twenty-five?” I asked her.  

She raised a now cut eyebrow at my guess.  

“Add ten years to that.”  

I was a little shocked. She did not at all look that old.   

“Oh, I guess we’re a year apart. I’m a little bit older.” I said, arms crossed, trying to pin down my own age.   

After my mother passed away, I sorta lost track, but I assumed I was one year older than Evie. Our birthdays might even be on the same date.  

“A little bit? Like ten years? More?” She said, not at all joking.  

“You thought I was like, over forty?” I said, fearing her honest answer.  

She was silent for a few seconds. It hurt a little.  

“You should take care of yourself better.”  

That was a given. But did I really look so much older? I sighed and shook my head, letting it go. People mistaking my age wasn’t my top worry at the moment.  

I decided to stay over for the night. The three-day time limit remained at the back of my mind. I couldn’t eat anything at breakfast, and I made sure to give everyone a tight hug before I left. Lucas could sense something was up. He handed me a rock he claimed to be a fossil he found all by himself. He was proud of it and made me promise I would return it after I saw him next. It was like he knew I wasn’t planning on coming back.   

Again, I lied and left Evie’s place and went back to my empty apartment.  

Alone with my thoughts, a darkness overtook my brain. It felt like I was drowning. I kept thinking of what the easiest way was to get the gruesome task done with limited damage to others.  

I didn’t want someone to have to find bloody remains. I oddly came out alive, no matter how hard I tried not to, on jobs, so dying while fighting a monster was off the table. Were there any kind of poisons I could get my hands on? If I messed up the amount, someone could find me and know what I tried to do., I did not want to get stuck in a hospital or go through a botched attempt.  

The answer came when my phone rang. Cameron called, so I answered it. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, but hearing her voice one last time would be nice. We talked about nothing too important. I valued that kind of friendship. I wish we had gotten to talk a bit more often since I met her. Before she hung up, she offered to hook me up with a relative since she heard I had such a rough time lately.  

I hesitated. A succubus could easily kill me. If I gave them permission to do so. Most needed to drain one or two people fully per year to stay alive. I accepted her offer, a tight knotting my stomach.  

I think the person who showed up was her cousin. We didn’t exchange names. They knew what they were there for. I took the risk and made it clear I wasn’t planning on surviving this encounter. They didn’t appear bothered by the statement. They even agreed not to tell Cameron the plan. Sure, she may be a little upset that a family member killed a friend, but it was just their nature, and it was my choice. No one was forcing me to do this.  

I think even if the copycat hadn’t threatened the people I cared about, this was always going to be my final outcome.  

I almost felt guilty for picking a pleasant way to go out.   

I won’t go into details of what happened over the next two days. I think anyone can guess. Since I was from a Hunter family, I had some resistance. One more day being with them would finish me off without any doubt. I turned off my phone, so when I woke up to the sound of one ringing, I was confused.  

I was drained right down to my very soul. It would take a few minutes to regain enough energy to sit up. I heard my temporary partner speak in the other room, but I made out a few words. Something about the fact that I had pants on. Which I did. I made sure to shower and put on boxers before I passed out.  

Closing my eyes, I expected them to come back into the room. When my brain finally caught up to what was going on, it was too late. The door opened, and it was not the person that I asked to take my life on the other side.  

“Oh, hey, you look like shit. Are you ready to talk?”  

Sitting up, and weakly threw a pillow at August. What was he even doing here/ suddenly, everything clicked.  

“Did you set all this up?” I hissed in a cracked voice.  

“Yupe. I promised to introduce your new friend to September in exchange for them coming over.” he explained, and I felt disgusted. “Sometimes you need to break things before you can put them back together.”  

He was well aware something was going on. And I would refuse to ever talk to him, or anyone, about it. He needed to catch me in a very weakened state to ever have that chance to get to the bottom of the issue. Rage flared up, and my stomach was full of acid. I shot up on unsteady legs, faintly away. This was the first time he’d seen most of my legs. I’d tried to hide the old scars that not even Ito’s final gift could heal. The blackness from my bad legs started to spread beyond my hip, also covering the entire side of my torso. Since I had a skin cover on the leg, I wasn’t certain how bad it looked.  

“What the hell is wrong with you? Peddling off a family member for something like that? Do you find this all fun? Do you just want to torment a person from a Hunter family? Are you mad that what I’m doing will hurt Lucas, is that it? Just let me die in peace. God, you really are a monster.” I said, wanting to scream at him, but I didn’t have the strength to raise my voice.  

I wanted it all to stop. The way I was feeling, the suffocating, constant thoughts and fears. And I didn’t want to deal with another person asking me what was wrong. At this point, there was nothing anyone could do to fix things.  

“Well, sometimes a big brother needs to be the bad guy.” He replied, ignoring my outbursts and angry expression.  

The dimpled smile on his face was the warmest I’d ever seen from him.  

His words were like a punch to the stomach.  

August was strange and scary in a way. He loved Evie like a sister. He adopted Lucas without a second thought. Regardless of whether they weren’t even the same species, the boy was his son. Full stop. He would do anything for his family, even hurting them if that meant helping them in the long run.  

It wasn’t too hard to accept that he saw me as a brother. He didn’t care about my bloodline, my faults, or any issues I had; I was family. His family.   

“I’m going to puke,” I said, and didn’t make it to the bathroom.  

He carefully took over and guided me there and helped clean off my chest of the thick black liquid that just erupted from my stomach. I hadn’t eaten in days, so I wasn’t sure what the vile sludge was.  

I sat on the floor, leaning against the toilet, legs outstretched in the small bathroom. He sat on the edge of the bathtub, waiting until I was ready to speak.  

“I think there’s something wrong with me...” I finally said.  

“I mean this in the nicest way possible, but no shit.” He said, smiling.  

I wanted to punch him, but he was too far away.  

“Why didn’t you tell me about Ito.” He said, and the air grew heavy.  

I realized that I hadn’t once mentioned Ito to him after his death. He must have heard about it, but we never talked about what happened.   

“I just... didn’t want to.” I admitted.  

If I mentioned it, he would want to help. I just didn’t bear to deal with his kindness. I just wanted to escape into work or into bed with another person, trying to forget everything. I had always done that. I just ran away from my problems. August would have made me face them.  

“I’ve been pretty selfish lately. Sorry... I never should have considered leaving without... I duinno. Leaving the way I was going to. I should at least try to pay off my medical debt. God, my brain has been so foggy I don’t even know how much I have left on that.” I let out a long sigh, resting my head against the cool bathroom wall.  

August, resting his chin in his hand, was amused at the statement. He had been a few steps ahead. I was never going to go through hurting myself because he wouldn’t let me.  

“I’ve heard human medical debt was bad. I had no idea how bad. I pray Lucas never breaks anything.” He commented.  

I’d closed my eyes and didn’t open them again when he spoke.  

“No, I owe Dr. Fillow for my bad leg.” I said, not raising my head.  

A very, very long silence came between us.  

“Dr. Fillow...? The supernatural one?” He said, sounding odd.  

I glanced over at him to see that he raised his head, his hand hovering as if I’d said something overly shocking.  

“Well, yeah. I don’t think there is another one.” I confirmed.  

“For that leg.” August said his long finger was pointing down at the leg in question.  

“Yes. I lost the other one. He needed to replace it with this.” I explained with an odd feeling in my stomach.  

“That leg.” He said again, almost like a demand.  

I had no idea why he was acting like this. I glance between the bad leg and his face. A set of eyebrows creased in concern met my gaze.  

“Yes...?” I said, feeling like I wanted to get away from this conversation.  

He suddenly slapped his thighs and then stood up. I couldn’t move fast enough as he hauled me off the floor and onto his shoulder.   

“Well, let’s see him for a check-up!” He chirped and reached for the door.  

For some odd reason, I panicked. No matter how much I struggled, I did not want to go into the clinic. In fact, I've never been to the clinic before. I’d always had home visits. Aside from being dragged around in only my boxers, I didn’t want to go for another reason. I was scared as hell and almost feral. I kicked, scratched, and cursed him out. August did not set me down.  

We entered a small white hallway, and I grew even more tense. I did not want to be here. Something was so wrong, and I couldn’t understand what.  

“Oh, hey, cousin! Can we borrow you for a minute!” August spoke out.  

“I’m busy. Please sign in.” A voice came that sounded familiar.  

He placed me down but kept an arm around my side to make sure I didn’t try to run. The man with dark hair in the hallway looked a little similar to August. He must be a bug-based supernatural creature. I doubted they were blood-related cousins. Most creatures would call each other cousin, aunt, or uncle if their species were similar. I’ve seen wolves call dog creatures cousins before.  

The man had a sharp face, dark eyes, and square glasses. He looked very much like the Dr. Fillow I knew. A brother, maybe?  

“Please, Civil, it’s important.” August pleaded in a sweet tone.  

“It’s Dr. Fillow to you.” The man corrected.  

“Oh, there are two of them?” I asked, and suddenly all eyes were in my direction.  

A nurse made up of a transparent pink substance came out of one of the rooms. The doctor handed them the bundle of papers in his hand, asking them to take over the patient in the other room, his attention now all on us.  

“What do you mean by that?” He asked carefully.  

“Well, you’re not the Dr. Fillow that treated my leg. So there has to be...” I said, trailing off as something finally clicked in my head.  

My mouth became dry, and August had to keep me upright. I wasn’t even aware of my surroundings as everything finally dawned on me. I had been so stupid for over two years and only now realized it.  

They gave me some time, and finally, Dr. Fillow spoke, his words snapping me from my sheer horror over the situation.  

“Do you have anyone who might hold a grudge against you?” He gently pressed, aware that I was having a minor mental breakdown.  

“I...” The words refused to come.   

Considering my job, I did, but this all happened before the fact that I came from a Hunter family came out. I’d lost my leg when my partner died. We had worked on easy jobs. Nothing like what I had been through the past year or so. Back then, I had no enemies. So why did someone pretend to be Dr. Fillow and, what? Replace my leg with a bad one to make me suffer? I placed a hand over my eye, fighting back a migraine.  

“When did this start? I mean, when did you get your leg replaced?” he pressed on.  

Someone pretending to be him was a big deal. We needed to figure out if I had been the only victim.  

Two years ago. No longer. When my partner died. They never found her body. I lost both legs. One was sewn back on and the other...” I started to feel sick again, feeling every ounce of pain coming from the tainted limb.  

“I heard about that. You were missing for two weeks. Do you remember anything from around that time?” August mentioned.  

He might have asked around about my past just to know what sensitive topics to avoid. I shook my head, not wanting to think about memories I wanted to avoid  

“No... wait, yes. Some. Just flashes. I was in bed recovering. Oh...” Something came to mind that I didn’t understand. “I saw my partner’s body. That doesn’t make sense. I was holding her hand. She fell into the sea, right? And her body was never found. It all doesn’t match up.”  

The two men glanced at each other, wanting to breach an uncomfortable theory.   

“How well did you two get along?” Dr. Fillow suggested.  

A sudden rage flared up, and I felt my face get hot.   

“I cared about her! We both did! What are you suggesting? She, what? Planned all this, pretended to be dead, and tormented me for two years? She doesn’t have that kind of skill to start with, and she wasn’t that kind of person.” I snapped, unable to hold back.  

“When I asked around, since her body is missing, they never confirmed she was dead. I don’t think she’s the one pretending to be Dr. Fillow, but your old partner may have something to do with all of this?” August suggested.  

I felt disgusted by him. I pushed away from him, hard. He stumbled back a little, startled by my reaction. If they ever met her, they would know that she was a victim in all this. A kindhearted, yet not very bright person, I deeply cared about.   

“Don’t you dare even hint that sort of thing! You know nothing about her!” I yelled, almost seeing red.  

This kind of reaction wasn’t like me. I never got heated like this. Something was wrong, and I couldn’t control myself. If I got even a little more upset, I risked actually hurting one of them.  

“I’m just saying-” August started again, raising his hands in front of him as if he was trying to calm down a wild animal.  

“Shut up! She wouldn’t-” I found my throat almost too tight to speak. Yet the words forced their way through. “Jayce has noth-”  

For the first time in over two years, I let myself say her name. It hurt to even think it. I couldn’t even finish my thought when things happened in slow motion. It felt like something snapped around my hip, and I started to fall back. A burst of heat came, then pain. August had lashed out, his hand turning into a set of claws that sliced through the bad leg, taking it off just below the hip. He grabbed it just as Dr. Fillow took hold of my body.  

I watched in horror, and August turned away, pressing the limb against his chest, curling around it as the flesh wriggled and started to expand. Dr. Fillow swiftly placed his body between us, acting like a shield to protect the weak human from what happened next.  

I heard a deafening sound, some screaming, then my vision went dark.  

I had no idea how long I was out for. I woke up in a clean yet stiff bed. The room was bright white, which took a while for my eyes to adjust to. I stayed on my back, trying to figure out what happened.  

I felt... fine. It was a shock. Some pain in my hip, but overall, just fine. The heaviness in my chest disappeared. It was as if I were a completely different person. Mentally, I went over what happened. I said my partner's name, August cut off my leg, then what?  

“Jayce...” I said out loud to the empty room.  

I could say it. I could think about her without the brutal mental pain it brought. Yes, I still missed her. And Ito, but I could handle it. Whatever major depression I had since she died had lightened.  

I sat up, spotting a pair of crutches near the bed. Aside from an IV, I wasn’t hooked up to anything. I must not have been out for very long. It took a while to get up and take hold of the crutches to head toward the door. I’d used them before when I was recovering, so it wasn’t overly hard to move around. Missing a leg felt very odd, though.  

I made my way into the hallway following a smell. Turning a corner, my stomach dropped seeing part of the building. It was black and burned and poorly roped off. Whatever happened with my leg had caused this. What about August?  

“You shouldn’t be up. Sit down.” A voice came from behind.  

Dr. Fillow stood with a loose sheet of fabric over his face. His hands and neck were wrapped in bandages.  A guilty feeling stabbed my stomach, and yet it wasn’t on the same level as before.  

“Your face...” I started, and he helped me into a chair against the wall.  

“I just burned away my human mask. It's fine, it’ll regrow. I find most people are put off by my real face.” He explained.  

“And August?” My pressing worry nearly caused me to stand up to look for him.  

“He just went to the washroom. He should-”  

He was cut off by a chirping noise, and then I was tackled into a very tight hug. After nearly crushing my ribs into dust, August pulled away so I could see the damage. His human skin had also been burned off. I looked at his insect face and dark, wavy hair flowing over it. He couldn't speak until he healed, so he kept chirping, trying to get his point across. His eyes were wide and dark. His jaw was long with sizable teeth that would be off-putting to most. I think I would have found him frightening when we first met. Now, I thought he looked cute.  

I wrapped my arms around his neck, thankful he was alive. A warm feeling swells in my chest. I hadn’t felt like this in a very long time.  

“I’m so sorry. For everything since we met. I wish you didn’t have to deal with that version of me.” I rambled as he clicked and chattered some inhuman language as a response. Somehow, I understood what he was trying to say. “I love you too. Thank you for everything so far.”  

Dr. Fillow, the real one, gave us a little bit of time before he wanted to get into everything.  I let August pull away, not wanting to think of not only how stupid I'd been, but also face the horror of what I went through. For over two years, I had a tainted body part attached by some mystery person who clearly had it out for me. They could have killed me at any time, but sat by and watched me suffer while pretending to help.  

“It seems the leg was a mixture of curses and spells sown together. I’m shocked it stayed on for so long and that you didn’t die. From what I pieced together from the leftovers, it did a few things. First, it amplifies your negative emotions. A stubbed toe might feel like the end of the world. Seriously, you’re fairly mentally strong to have dealt with that for as long as you did. However, that doesn’t change the fact that you went through a lot and had certain feelings or thoughts. Just because the leg is off doesn’t mean you’re fully cured of any issues.” Dr. Fillow explained, arms crossed.  

He must have heard that I have yet to go to therapy. His stern tone was a warning to do so once everything was sorted out.   

“Do you remember how much you paid this person, or who you were even sending money to?” He asked, and I shook my head.  

My memories were still foggy. Most of the money I’d made went to the imposter. I assumed it was to keep me dirt broke, then taking risks with dangerous jobs to make me suffer.  

“I asked a friend to look into your accounts. We may be able to find where it went, but it might not lead us to who it went to.”   

I muttered a small thanks, feeling embarrassed that not once did I question the money issue. Curse and tainted magic or not, I should have realized something was up sooner.  

Dr. Fillow put a hand on his hip, trying to get more details straight.   

“I heard a fake version of you appeared and attacked some of your friends. We can assume that the person set the fire to scare August. The issue is, we don’t know what kind of creature it could be. I assume they’re working with someone. Copycats and mimics are not talented spell-wise. Neither of them would be smart enough or strong enough to create this leg.”  

I frowned, crossing my arms, thinking back to the fake version of myself I saw and briefly spoke to. They must be the person behind all of this. But I had no idea what kind of creature they could be.  

“Copycats or mirror creatures need to take the originals, right? I’m still here, so it wasn’t one of those. Mimics need to eat part of a person to copy them. It’s possible one ate my missing leg, but what about August? If he left some blood at a job, then... No. The fake Dr. Fillow wasn’t perfect. It was as if they only heard what you looked like and did their best with that.” I said mostly to myself.  

August chirped, and I shook my head.  

“I’ve only met the real Dr. Fillow now. I wasn’t doing risky jobs before and was lucky enough to never need to come to the clinic.” I explained.  

It was the reason why I had been fooled by the fake.   

“Then they transformed with a spell?” Dr. Fillow suggested.  

“No. I saw them. I would be able to see if it was a spell or not.”  

I sighed, and the two of them kept thinking. Since there were so many different creatures, it was almost impossible to figure out what we were facing with so little information.  

“A half breed may have shapeshifting abilities unlike other full-blooded creatures. Some that we have never seen before. Again, they could not have created this leg. They must be working with someone. If only we knew anyone you sinned against from the past.”  

The other man shrugged, unaware his words gave enough clues for me to figure things out. My head had been foggy because of the tainted leg. Now that I was thinking clearly, things came rushing back.  

“Oh! A half breed!” The words slipped out once things mentally fell into place. “I dated one when I was younger. Around the time my mother was sick! They were half mirror, half mimic with some human mixed in somewhere.”  

Dr. Fillow appeared alarmed under the cloth that was covering his face. August looked between us, trying to follow along.  

“That’s a bad combination. Humans need a sense of identity. Adding that to those two kinds of creatures causes a great deal of mental instability. You wouldn’t need to do much to get on the bad side of a half breed like that. Still, they would not be strong enough to harm your friend Harp. Or create the leg. From the looks of things, it was rigged to explode when you said your old partner's name. Yes, the half breed you dated may hate you enough to think of such a thing, but not create the means to do so.”  

I looked over the blackened and ruined hallway, my stomach dropping, and fear again spiking through my veins. I had been walking around with a bomb that could have gone off at any time. I felt sick when I considered what might have happened if I said Jacye’s name at the wrong time. The trigger was meant to hurt me. I could have lived through the explosion, but what if I had been around Lucas when it went off? By the time I healed enough to talk about her, it would have been with someone I cared about. August was strong enough to live through the attack. After shaking my head, I kept speaking about what else I figured out.  

“Have you ever heard of being infected by Sin?” I asked Dr. Fillow.  

Again, he looked alarmed. August was confused, and I realized I had never fully explained it to him. After a brief catch-up, Dr. Fillow nodded at my suggestion.  

“Before Jayce... what happened to her, I did a job saving mimics and similar creatures from a trafficking ring. We failed to save at least one of them. When we caught up, the creature was gone, and there was evidence of a ritual left behind. There is a chance that the creature was the one I dated years ago. And they may have been infected around that time. If they realized I failed to save them, then maybe... I don’t think they set up the job that caused Jayce’s death. They saw me barely alive and decided to do whatever it took to make me suffer to get back on failing them.”  

Dr. Fillow nodded along, listening to my theory. It was the best idea we had.  

“Wrath. It makes sense. I’ve heard you might be part of the Dougherty family. They have extreme cases of luck. Good and bad. It’s entirely possible that all of this fell into place. Since we have a lead, I’ll call the Corporation t-’  

“No!” I shot up, forgetting I was missing a leg, and August needed to keep me in my seat.  

“This is my problem! If they get involved, they’ll either kill them or collar them. I don’t know if it was the tainted magic or my own selfishness, but I can’t seem to remember their name. I don’t think it’s right that they attacked people I care about, but I understand why they lashed out at me, considering how I’ve treated them...”  

Back then, I just left them behind. I know I had their phone number, but without a full name, it was impossible to find them again after that number went out of service. They often shifted their body from one gender and would take different nicknames. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t remember what they went by when we were together. It was my first relationship, and I ended it poorly, then failed to save them when they needed it the most.  

“It’s nice you want to deal with this yourself, but how are you going to do that, missing a leg?” Fillow pointed out.  

“I don’t suppose you have a spare?” I asked, hopeful.  

“No. The damage the tainted magic has done would make a new one impossible to stick. At least a flesh one. If I made one for you, it wouldn’t last very long. The other issue is that I provide my services for free. I don’t have the funds to drop on the materials you need. We would need to contact The Corporation because they normally cover things like this. If you want them to stay out of things, you’ll have to pay up.”  

I sighed, closing my eyes, feeling stuck. I was dirt broke. August chattered away, but I shook my head. I didn’t want him to pay for my mistakes.  

“Um... Sorry, I we couldn’t help but overhear...” A new voice came, and I opened my eyes again.  

A taller man stood next to a lizard creature standing on two legs. He had a beard and very kind blue eyes. The lizard beside him had a broad chest with a simple light green cardigan covering part of it, and dark black pants to hide the well-built legs. He was holding the lizard’s clawed hand, and I assumed they were a couple.  

“Oh, sorry, were we talking too loud?” I asked, feeling guilty.   

The damage to the building was my fault. And most likely the reason why these two could hear us in the waiting room is because of all the new holes in the walls.   

“Not at all. Sound just travels well in here right now...” He trailed off for a second, then got back onto the reason why they came over in the first place. “I’m Skyler West. This is my girlfriend, Hot Sauce.” he introduced themselves.  

The lizard next to him gave an open-mouth smile. Her body looked very masculine, but most lizard creatures did. Her smile was cute, though.  

“I’m sort of a Contract Worker like you. I would like to help out if I could. My brother is loaded, so we can cover the cost of a new leg.” He offered.  

I was stunned that a stranger would offer such a thing. I started to shake my head, embarrassed to accept such an offer.  

“His place has floors made of gold. We can afford it.” Skyler said, sounding a bit shy admitting such a thing.  

“Super duper loaded.” Hot Sauce confirmed in a raspy voice.  

“That would be... Thank you.” I said, wondering what the chances of a person who could solve one of my problems not only being here but overhearing the entire thing.  

I would really need to pay them back for this once everything gets sorted out.   

The nurse I’d seen before arrived just as we were talking about a timeline of getting me fixed up. She had some papers in her hands, asking if the pair wanted to go into a private room to speak about the checkup results.  

“Nah. You can tell all of us.” Hot Sauce nodded, not caring who heard her medical results.  

“Well, nothing has changed since the last time. The second egg seems a bit small, so it would be best to rest more and add more calcium to your diet.” The nurse said and handed over the papers for more information.  

Skyler froze on the spot. His face turned pale as his head very slowly turned toward his girlfriend.  

“Second... egg....?” He asked slowly. For a bigger guy, his voice was on the softer side. “We’re... having two?”  

Hot Sauce looked over completely, forgetting to let him know about that detail. Her mouth opened wide, showing off all her teeth.  

“Surprise!” She said cheerfully.  

Dr. Fillow and August needed to catch our new friend before he smashed his face against the floor from fainting, hearing such news. I mentally promised him to babysit whenever he wanted in the future. I think he might need the help.   

My new savior was hauled off to collect himself in another room. It was odd how easily things were falling into place.  

Now that we were aware of the threat, we could take precautions against it. Klaus agreed to request some Agents to watch over my loved ones on the down low and keep it off the books. He didn’t want Lupa to get wind of a creature with rare shape-shifting abilities.  We needed to solve this all soon, or else someone would start asking questions about why some Agents suddenly became friends with people I had connections with and wanted to hang around them.  

Once I knew everyone was safe, August collected my phone. It needed to be charged before I made a very important call.  

The fake Dr. Fillow’s number was still at the top of my contact list. I dialed it, feeling on edge with each ring. I didn’t expect anyone to pick up, yet they did.  

Silence overtook the other end of the call, and I thought they hung up for a second.  

“You’re not dead yet. Such a shame.” The voice said, sounding oddly calm.  

Fear crashed through my body in waves. I’d faced a lot in my life. Death of loved ones, monsters, Gods, limbs being ripped off, and my body being torn apart. However, this person scared me in a completely different way compared to all of that.   

They created my suffering and watched quietly for years. They used my faults against me, using tainted magic to muddle up my brain enough that I would blame myself for my suffering. I had been in the palm of their hand without knowing for so long. Aside from the outburst when I spoke to them after they harmed Harp, they never showed any outward sign of anger. The deep, endless hatred felt so cold that I almost couldn’t bring myself to speak.  

“Who are you?” I asked in almost a whisper.  

That was the wrong question to ask. I could almost feel the rage over the phone.  

“One week. I’ll be at your old house, where we first met.” The call went dead after those words.  

I closed my eyes, a headache forming. No matter how hard I tried, I could only remember bits and pieces from that time in my life.   

I had dated a mimic creature that changed its gender and body type often. Also, their name. What did they start off as? We lived next to each other. Since we were around the same age, we became fast friends, and then things led to another. My mother was sick around that time, and when she died, I left. I just left them behind.  

Could I not remember because of the tainted magic left over in my system? Or because of my mother’s death? Or because I was a dumb kid who hurt someone very important without a second thought?  

I had time to try and remember. Even if it didn’t come back, I needed to make things right.  

Now, with what seemed to be access to an unlimited amount of cash, getting a new leg was fast. Two days after the phone call, a new fleshy one had been replaced where the old, tainted one had been. Dr. Fillow warned that this was temporary. This limb would last a week to a few months, depending on how much I used it. Then, I would need a prosthetic.    

I doubted I would be able to keep working as a Contract Worker once I lost this leg. I wasn’t worried about that. I just needed it to last long enough to deal with what I had left behind.  

Dr. Fillow wanted me on bed rest. I refused. I needed a test run. Against his wishes, I accepted an easy-looking job.  

August came with me. His human flesh has not regrown yet. I felt guilty that he was missing out on time with Lucas simply because he couldn’t let his son see his true face. Whenever he sensed those feelings coming off me, he would ambush me in a tight hug. The affection was odd but not rejected.  

The job was, of course, in a forest. The normal story of hiking disappearing. I hated how often innocent people died simply because a creature got hungry. There was simply no system that could ensure humans and monsters lived together peacefully.  

I couldn’t get over how much lighter my body felt. I wasn’t aware of how weighed down I had been from mental exhaustion until it was mostly gone. Using my eyesight to find the threat lurking inside the dense woods was far too easy. It was a very good thing that the eyesight couldn’t be used by Hunters. If the wrong person has access to it, they would be a major threat. In fact, if I were able to keep a good leg, I was positive I could now handle myself in a fight against someone as powerful as Klaus or Lock.  

Just as I was getting far too confident in myself, I was taken down a notch. The creature snatching up hikers was a mess of flesh and plant matter. But also with patches of holes where deadly small insects made their home inside. Seeing it made my skin crawl.  

August held his own against the attacks directed towards him. I found myself flinching and unable to focus whenever I saw the batches of holes get closed. It made the top of my head prickle. The spots started to spread further on the lumpy body, and I needed to turn away, holding back a scream that was caught in my throat.  

I’d forgotten that when it came to magic, battles weren’t always won by the person with the better abilities. I now understand why August couldn’t figure out how to fight against spider creatures. This newfound phobia of mine kept me from being able to attack or even get close to the threat. When a clawed hand with patches of those small holes grazed my chest, I wanted to cry. The jacket kept me protected from any damage.   

I had access to unlimited magic I could control, a crazy healing ability, and a tanked-up jacket most Contract Workers would dream of having. After everything I’d been through, I was now on the same level as some top Agents, power-wise, despite being human. And yet, I was hiding behind a tree like a scared little girl, unable to face a basic creature that should have taken second to deal with.  

If August hadn’t come with me, I would have been screwed. While I was hiding, he ripped the creature apart into such small pieces that it would not be able to heal itself again. The job was finished with no help from his all-powerful friend. He peeked behind the tree, dark shiny eyes reflecting my shaky expression. He raised a thumb, asking if I was alright. I raised one back, holding back tears.  

At least I found out my body was ready to face the meeting in my old home a few days from now. Mentally, I wasn’t so sure.
