All was right until it was wrong. I felt these words rush through my mind almost as if the wind was whistling through my ears. April 28, 1980: the number one song was "call me" by blondie. I hated blondie. But it was also the release date of my new favorite character, Mr. game and watch. I drove to my local video game store for the release, and scrapped together what little dollars I had left for cash after saving up 80 dollars for the game. I parked my car next to an old women who gave me a look I would never forget. Something about her stair was cynical, almost disgusted, but I couldn't help but smell an air of sexual deviance and maturity. I opened the door of the video game store and to my shock, all the copies of Mr. game and watch were gone.



 I was devastated, what was I supposed to buy. I'd grown past Super Mario Brothers and needed something that was just.. real. I went to the store clerk up front and mentioned all the copies of game and watch that were off the shelves, he reiterated my fears and I let out a sigh. houhhhhhh. what a shame. Just before I was going to leave out the door, the store clerk stopped me, "Well... if you really wanna play game and watch, i have a Japanese version of the game sitting here that's typically just for display. I'll sell it to you for only 10 dollars more." I was in shock. Game and watch, in all its oriental glory. I had to have it. I said that I'd go search for more cash in my car, but just as I opened the door of the video game store, there she was right in front of my face, nose to nose, with her eyes hugging mine. The old woman from before, holding out a 10 dollar bill. My hands begin to shake, i take the 10 dollars from her, seemingly to her delight.



 She smiles, and lets out a little spit from her mouth. Before she goes I try to lick it off, but she pushes me with her hand, and points to the ring on her finger. I re enter the video game store, and the store clerk is gone, but the game and watch is still left there on the counter. I drop my cash on the counter, grab the game, and make a b line to my car. I start the engine up as fast as I could and make my way to my house. I shout to my mother to leave me be, and shut my bedroom door behind me. I turn on my Gameboy after putting the cartridge in and notice something... different. The game looked like all the things I had seen in the magazines, but the sounds were eery. I noticed that all of the songs sounded like they had been pitched down, like my Gameboy was broken. I go to turn it off in order to restart it, but the screen wouldn't flicker. The light on my Gameboy had switched from green to red, but the game was still on. 



I reluctantly press start and was terrified by what I saw. It was... me. It was me sitting in my bed, with my Gameboy, a replica of my entire room. Each painting, each plant, all in the right place. But something was different, in the game, game and watch was standing in front of my door, blocking the exit, but when i looked up, nothing was there. Then suddenly, the game and watch on my screen inches forward, and i see my rug begin to stutter. I throw the Gameboy down. "hello, is anyone there?", the game and watch inches forward again, this time a chef hat appeared on his head. 



I start to panic, i attempt to run out of my room but my body was paralyzed when i reached the door. I look back down at my Gameboy, and the perspective had changed. Game and watch was now holding a Gameboy. and I was no longer on the screen. But i was still frozen, then, all of my worst fears came to reality. I began to move without my own regard. My legs begin moving as I inched towards the kitchen. I had no control at this point, I looked back down at my Gameboy and realized, he was the one who was gaming, And i was merely watching. I make my way to the kitchen and find the wok pan I had seen my entire life, the one my mom used to make me dinner earlier that day. I begin to jerk my hand furiously, attempting to flip meat that wasn't there, eventually the pan SMACKS me in the face, and I'm forced to drop it. 



As soon as i believe I'm at his mercy, I shout for my mother again, who's no where to be found. "Please, please just let me be, I'll never play this game ever again." I pleaded with game and watch, as my tears began to mix with the blood that rushed from my head from the pan. Suddenly, I began to move again, and this time I was moving towards the back door. No matter how hard I tried to resist, the game and watch tugged at my soul. Whatever control I had over my body, he somehow was showing how little I truly had. I made my way to the fathers old shed, where we used to work on tree house projects. I slam open the door and instantly see what he's looking for. My fathers hammer. Somehow as time passed, I began to accept this reality. 



I would be a slave to his desires. But, just as I was ready to relinquish control, I realized what he was after. I turned towards my mother, who was tending to her bed of roses outside. No. Please no. Not my own mother. I changed my mind. I was ready to fight, i was ready to fight it. I couldn't do this anymore, i wouldn't be a slave. I began to take steps towards her, i tried to move my lips but no matter what I tried, my lips were sealed shut. I was only a few steps away now, tracking dirt with my resistance. Please no, I can't do this. But little did I know, from the moment I entered that game store and tried to lick the spit off of that grandma, it was too late. I raised my hand and showed my weapon to the sun, I could somehow control my eyes, and I was able to close them. 



I felt the pain of Abraham in this moment. But my mother, my own mother. I couldn't do it. It happened, I swing my hammer down upon my mothers crown. It was only a 3, She shrieked, blood instantly gushed from her head as she fell onto the bed of roses. Again game and watch imposed himself. This time hitting a 6, leaving her almost unconscious. "Why! Why would you do this, please Eric please stop". it was too late. The third swing from game and watch left her unconscious, leaving a 9. And finally, finally, I was free. There I was covered in the blood of my mother in front of my whole neighborhood. Finally, my father pulled into the driveway, and there I was holding a hammer next to his dead wife. He looked horrified, but I couldn't help but Smile as he watched this sick game come to an end.
