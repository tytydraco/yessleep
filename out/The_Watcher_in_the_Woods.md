Part 1: The Shadow

It was our first week in the new house, a quaint, old cottage nestled at the edge of an expansive forest. My parents had fallen in love with the place immediately—the peaceful surroundings, the gentle rustling of leaves, the way the sunlight filtered through the tall, ancient trees. But from the moment we arrived, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn’t the house itself, but the woods—dense, dark, and seemingly endless. Every time I looked out toward the forest, I had the strangest sensation, like something—or someone—was watching.

At first, I tried to ignore it. After all, moving to a new place could be unsettling, especially in such a remote location. I chalked it up to nerves and told myself it was nothing more than my imagination playing tricks on me. But deep down, that nagging feeling wouldn’t go away.

One evening, just before dusk, something strange happened. As the last rays of sunlight disappeared behind the trees, I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye. It was quick—so fast that I almost missed it. But I was sure of what I saw: a shadowy figure, darting between the trunks of the trees. It wasn’t an animal. It was tall, slender, and moved with an unnatural speed. I blinked, straining my eyes to see more clearly, but the figure was gone as quickly as it had appeared.

My heart raced as I stood by the window, staring out into the growing darkness. Could it have been a trick of the light? Perhaps the swaying branches casting unusual shadows? I tried to convince myself it was nothing, but a chill ran down my spine as the air around me seemed to grow colder.

That night, I found it impossible to sleep. Every creak of the house, every whisper of the wind outside made my skin crawl. I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling, my mind replaying the scene over and over. What had I seen? Was it real? And if it was… what was it? I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was lurking in the woods, watching, waiting.

The next morning, I tried to tell my parents about what I had seen. My dad chuckled, brushing it off as my imagination. "New places always feel strange at first," he said, patting me on the shoulder. "You’ll get used to it." My mom agreed, her attention focused on unpacking boxes. I wanted to believe them. I wanted to think it was all in my head. But deep down, I knew something was wrong. And the worst part was, I didn’t think they would ever believe me.

That evening, the unease returned as the sun began to set. I found myself by the window again, peering out at the woods, hoping—no, dreading—that I would see the shadowy figure again. For a long time, nothing happened. The forest remained still, bathed in the dim light of dusk. Just when I started to relax, I saw it again. The figure stood at the edge of the trees, motionless, as if waiting for something. My breath caught in my throat. It didn’t move, didn’t blink, didn’t make a sound. It just stood there, watching the house.

I wanted to call out to my parents, but I was frozen, rooted to the spot. My mind raced with questions. Was it a person? Some kind of animal? Or something else entirely? Just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure melted back into the shadows of the trees, disappearing from sight. I backed away from the window, my heart hammering in my chest.

This time, I didn’t say anything. I knew my parents wouldn’t believe me, and honestly, I wasn’t sure I believed it myself. But that night, I slept with my curtains tightly drawn, my heart pounding with every small sound the house made.

And then, late that night, the knocking began...
