My name is Deon, and four years ago my family moved from Cape Town to a farm about three hours away—middle of nowhere, nothing but dirt roads and silence. I fought it. I didn’t want to leave behind my friends, the familiar suburbs, the noise.
I didn’t know how much the noise had been protecting me.

Out here, quiet isn’t peace.
Quiet is attention.
Quiet watches.

The nearest neighbors are a 25-minute walk away. At night, with no moon, the darkness is a solid thing, thick enough to choke on. The wind hits the walls like fists. My room is tiny—two by three meters—with my bed facing north and a window on my left. Tiles across the porch click sharply when stepped on, amplifying every sound until the whole house feels hollow.

We have a piano in the living room. I play almost every day. It’s the one thing that feels like mine.

A month ago, that changed.

The First Night

It was just past midnight when Olaf, my beagle, jolted upright—hackles raised, teeth barely bared. He wasn’t looking at me.
He was staring at the window.

Then: gravel crunching. Slow. Deliberate. Heavy.

Footsteps circled the house. Then stopped beneath my window. Something long and thin dragged across the brickwork—too smooth for claws, too controlled for branches.

The air pressed against my skin like the room itself was breathing down my neck. Olaf whimpered. I couldn’t move.

By morning there were tracks in the dirt. Long, split impressions, sunk far deeper than any animal we have out here.

When I Was Alone

A few days ago, my dad left on a work flight. Mom and my sister drove him to the airport and stayed with family for a few days.
I’m used to being alone on the farm. I’m used to having the rifle—an old .22 Mauser—leaning against my bed.

Just past midnight, the wind stopped.

Tiles clicked. One by one. Getting closer.

Olaf let out a growl so deep I didn’t know his throat could make that sound.

The steps didn’t wander this time.
They came straight to my window.

The glass bowed inward—not cracked, not rattling—bowed, like something was lightly pressing its forehead against it.

Then the whisper came.
Not out loud.
Inside my head.

> “…Deee…on…”



My name.

My hands were shaking when I grabbed the rifle. I pointed it at the window. Something cold brushed the back of my neck.

I fired.

The shot deafened me—but the glass didn’t shake. Not even a tremor.

The next morning, the same tracks circled the house. Closer. Cleaner.
Following a route.

Learning.

Tonight

Tonight I knew something was wrong before anything happened. The quiet felt heavy again, pressing on the walls.

I went to the bathroom past midnight. When I walked back, Olaf was standing on my bed, rigid, staring down the hallway.

Gravel outside.
Footsteps.
North side.
The front door.

The handle pressed down. Slowly. Testing the lock.

Then the smell drifted in through the gaps: wet earth and something metallic, sharp enough to sting the back of my throat.

From the living room, a single piano key rang out.

Low.
Soft.
Careful.

Another.
Another.

Then every key slammed at once—all 88—like fists pounding the wooden frame. Dust shook from the ceiling. The tiles under my feet vibrated.

Then footsteps again.
Inside the house.

It was retracing my steps from a minute earlier—from the bathroom to my room. Like it was memorizing my path.

The hallway light flickered. Then died.

Click.
Click.
Click.
Tiles tapping under invisible weight. Getting closer.

Olaf dove under the bed. My hands were sweating around the stock of the Mauser. The shadows in the hallway stretched, reaching toward my doorway like fingers.

Then—silence.

Right outside my door.

The doorknob twitched.
Then slowly began to turn.

A breath pressed through the wood—slow, patient.

Then the whisper, muffled but unmistakably at the door:

> “…open…”



The lock clicked once.
Then again.
Metal shifted.

The doorknob turned further.

It was coming in.

I had nowhere to run.
