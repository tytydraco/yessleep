It was too sweet of an opportunity to pass up. Thirteen championship-quality thoroughbreds – painted thoroughbreds at that – freshly broken, and best of all, unbranded.

I ain’t sure how much y’all know about horse breeding, much less horse thieving – and I can go on how both are a dying craft these days – but to say this was a rare treat would vastly understate the matter.

See, I don’t do this outlaw shit for kicks. My boss is a horse rancher and has made no small name for himself throughout the state. But, y’all know the saying. Hard times make hard men. A few bad investments equaled a few bad seasons. Even though my boss came from a long line of successful ranchers, a downward trend for even a couple of years is a death knell in our trade.

So about a few weeks ago, the boss invited me into his den in the Big House. He sat me down by the great stone hearth fire, poured me a generous helping of Macallan 30, and asked point-blank if I were “willing to do what it takes” to “save our legacy.”

Short of the long is, I was. And am. I owed the man that and much, much more.

We all have to pay for our sins at some point, and my own reckoning has long been in the making even before that night that sealed our fates. Maybe this thing prowling around the ranch tonight, sating itself on the flesh of my friends and family, is the reckoning we all here deserve. Some fuckin’ legacy.

Anyways.

We had scoped out half a dozen potential sites to hit, on either private or Rez land. Now I harbored no particular ill will against the local nations and tribes. They simply had a reputation for breeding the best horses, then and now.

That reputation held up, for like I said a few nights ago my crew and I came across that stud of young and unbranded thoroughbreds that had to be worth upwards of a hundred thousand. Each. Plus with them being as-yet unbranded, we could expect to get full price and more without any law being able to pin it on us.

I don’t think any man in my position could have resisted that sort of lure.

After a couple of nights of keeping watch on the place, we made our move. We crept in quieter than churchmice, the fullness of Bella Luna shining on our backs. Contrary to some fiction, in the deepest hours of dark sky country, the moon doesn’t really do all that much to light the way. Not in the way we needed. The five of us each had a set of civilian-model NVGs to help with that, courtesy of the boss.

The small ranch house was completely blacked out. Even looked mighty decrepit. Hell, there weren’t even any vehicles or equipment in sight for that matter. If it wasn’t for the spacious pen filled with those magnificent steeds, I’d have said the place was abandoned.

A dozen yards short of the pen we crouched behind a small workshed and quietly went over the plan one more time.“Alright, step lightly now boys,” I whispered to my crew. Some I had worked with for years, others were newer and less wrangled let’s say, but each was picked for one reason – I knew they were the type of men to keep hush-hush about this sorta work.

“Lee and I will get to the pen and coax those big boys out. They’re roped together already, so leading ‘em should be easy enough,” I said. “Russ, you walk ‘round us as were leading 'em, keep them calm and in line. 

“Gage, you take the new guy and keep perimeter watch for any trouble, though I don’t expect none.”

“M’name’s Pete,” the new guy mumbled.

I allowed myself a grin, and the boys followed suit.

“I know, new guy. Talk to me ‘gain after we save the ranch and our jobs. We’re about to be rich men, y’all. Good luck, stay quiet, and no chattin’ till we’re back on the trucks!”

The first bit went as easy as predicted. The dozen thoroughbreds were surprisingly placid, and in the white phosphor night vision I could easily see their trained forms obey the slight pulls from Lee and myself.

“Almost seems too little of fuss,” Lee muttered.

I was about to give him a smack for breaking silence when I saw a great dark shape move near the back of the pen.

*Gahdamnit, musta missed one*, I thought, waving Russ over to take over my set of reins. 

Flashing sign that roughly translated to what I’d just realized, the two men who were most like brothers to me quickly understood and kept moving.

As I reached the back of the pen, I strained my eyes in the night vision, wondering how even in such a uniquely large enclosure I could have missed a fucking horse the size of which stood ‘afore me.

A massive platinum-white stallion, a good head or taller and twice as muscular as any of the other horses we had just appropriated looked at me with an expression that I would have sworn upon any bible betrayed a level of sapient intelligence previously unknown to any creature but humans. 

It was a beautiful creature, *too* beautiful, but all I could see then looking upon it was the wealth it would bring me and the boss.

“I think we’ll be keeping you on, buddy,” I whispered to it, breaking my own rule.

Leading it out, I’d almost caught up to Lee and Russ near the ranch’s edge when the telltale sound of long-warped wood screeched out in the night.

A tall indigenous man wielding a bright lantern and ancient over-under shotgun was talking furiously at Gage and the new guy who were standing nearest him. But, when he saw me leading that great silvery beast, the older man’s eyes went wide. In fear or fury I couldn’t tell then. Still, I know now that it wasn’t just in dismay of having his prize steeds stolen – it was the one I was holding in particular that sent him in a raving diatribe of his nation’s tongue that, unfortunately, none of us knew.

“Go back inside, old man iffin’ ye know what’s good for ya in these next moments,” Gage muttered, not even bothering to draw his own pistol.

The native man threw down his shotgun and limped-ran right at me, shifting his free hand between pointing at the stallion and back towards the horse pen. I knew what he wanted me to do, but right then there was no way in Hell I was gonna comply. If I knew then what I do now, I would’ve happily given the old man back his burden.

“Sir I apologize, but if you ain’t figured it out, we don’t speak your language!” I shouted at him, moving my hand slightly towards my own holstered gun. “Now, do as my friend says and just go back inside, we don’t wanna hurt y–”

I truly had no intention of harming him, or anyone else in the pursuit of this. But, like I’d told the boss, I was willing to do whatever was necessary. 

So when the new guy Pete took the foolhardy initiative of shooting the old man in the back causing him to show an unexpected vitality by spinning around and drawing a hidden revolver with the intent of killing my boys, I reacted.

Two quick shots to the back of the man’s head finished the job. Though the horses nearest the truck led by Russ and Lee started whinnying and stomping some at the disturbance in the still evening, the colossal beast next to me couldn’t have been less disturbed.

Shit, but it looked *happy*.

“Goddamnit new guy, what the everlivin’ fuck was that?” I half-yelled.

“Just takin’ care of an obstacle, sir,” the new guy muttered back.

“Goddamn kid, you’re colder’n Santa’s cock on Christmas! He’s got a point, Karl. Old guy was a bad loose end to leave walking,” Gage intervened.

I shook my head. I was hardly innocent in this, after all.

“Let’s just get the fuck outta here and be done with this night.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Most of the men were drinking hard at the bunkhouse in celebration of our “victory” that next evening. Me, I was doing my usual wandering of the grounds. Hardly slept at all on the best of nights anyways.

I checked in with the boss to give him the news. Though I was still a bit bothered by the killing of the old man, the boss didn’t give me any grief. In fact, he suggested I give Pete a bonus after all was said and done. The boss reminded me we all needed to stay strong and that we had brought home our salvation in one neat haul.

“I already have a buyer on the hook for a special few horses. You’ve done a damn good thing, son, for all of us” he said in his practiced reassuring tones.

“Just get a good rest tonight, and tomorrow, we’ll be back on top where we belong.”

That sleep didn’t come, so instead I found myself walking the land our family had held for generations. The sweet smell of sage grass and juniper brush, wet from the recent rainfalls calmed me as they always did. But as I made my way to our own horse pen to say goodbye to those fine steeds, I noticed something that made the blood in my veins turn to ice.

They were gone. Every single one of those hundred grand thoroughbreds had just up and disappeared from the locked enclosure…except for one.

The colossal platinum stallion stared at me with eyes that, in the well-lit area, I could see were blazing crimson. More so, those eyes seemed to burn with that same sapiency now tuned towards a fiery hatred. I could feel its hate boring into my soul as it sauntered calm as could be up to me at the edge of the pen, its entire stature growing, expanding with each clop of its hooves.

My mind began to turn fuzzy as it tried to comprehend the nightmare to which it was bearing witness. I instinctively backed up, stumbling and falling backward into the red dirt. The back of my head smacked on a rock which only served to turn that fuzzyness into a near-on blackout.

Blinking like a madman I watched like a helpless child as the creature finished its horrific shapeshifting. Standing on its now meaty, treetrunk hind legs, the not-horse’s neck and head morphed into an elongated mess, its thick teeth jutting out wildly every which way. However, the bit that sent me over the edge into apathetic insanity was the pair of human eyes that pushed themselves out of the not-horse’s silvery chest. Those eyes flickered over me in the way a person might consider an ant upon the ground, before shrugging and crushing it to oblivion.

Quicker than lighting that foul muddle of a head whipped low and bit right through the fucking steel chain holding the pen’s gate closed, easy as you or I might bite into a carrot. Right before losing consciousness – whether from the blow to my head or being lost to the madness in front of me – I heard within the recesses of my mind a voice steeped in contempt for all humankind. It spoke but a single word, yet it still echoes clearly within me even as I sit here hunkered in my cabin.

***áchxą́hwíídéeniʼ***

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke to the smell of fire and burning flesh.

The bunkhouse was ablaze, flames writhing so intensely that I could almost hear the choirs of Hell singing out from within the inferno. Even then the stout two-story building was halfway collapsed and ready to give out further at any second.

I walked past it. Past the rank scent of my burning friends and hands. There was only one building, only one person that I felt driven to confirm their fate before I succumbed to my own.

Coming up on the large oaken steps that led to the now-obliterated doors of the Big House, I barely paused at the sight of Lee’s headless body. His arms were ripped – no, bitten, from their bloody sockets, half chewed and discarded in the clay dirt. My friend’s beautiful rifle, embossed with german silver, was crushed. Snapped in two.

*Only thing he treated better than that gun was his horse.*

It's funny what rogue thoughts sweep into your mind at the witnessing of the unreal.

Seeing his head was nowhere to be found and choosing to ignore how his heart was absent from its own socket within the man’s chest, my heavy steps continued up and into the great ranch house. I drew my Ruger Blackhawk, for all the good it would do, shuffling forward into the main body of the boss’s home, insanely hoping that I could at least apologize for bringing our doom.

Instead, I pushed through the wrecked glass doors leading into the dining hall, only to see that I was too late even for that.

My father’s broken and torn form was seated – placed? – on his usual seat at the long table’s head in a mocking display of the proud man he once was. Behind the tall mahogany chair stood the great beast, its perfect silvery hide now coated with gore and soot. Though it didn’t seem to care, rather the thing’s horse and human eyes both seemed to revel in the slaughter it had sowed.

A wave of despair coupled with the rawest misery I had felt in my thirty-three years of life drove me to my knees in front of the body of the one who had raised me. He wasn’t the best of men, I know that. Especially in these past hard few years. But he was my father.

 We only get one.

Closing my eyes partly to stem the tears and partly deny my final moments the sight of the terror in front of me, I grabbed the boss’s bloodwetted hands and prayed that God would forgive us, for this abomination surely would not.

I trembled when I felt the not-horse rest one of its hooves on my shoulder, the heaviness keeping me in place on my knees. So heavy, that I nearly toppled over and instinctively tightened my grip on my dead father’s hand and slipped further down onto the hardwood floor. The not-horse thing’s other hoof hand pushed down on my other shoulder, driving me lower and pinning me down for good.

I began to hear those strange whispers in that unfamiliar tongue again, the ethereal voice threatening to undo the final threads of my ever-loosening sanity. It was then that I realized my right hand had something in its palm. From where I was pinned on the floor, the not-horse couldn't see me open my clenched fist to see a small piece of crimson stained paper fall from it, as well as an equally stained iron key.

The key, I recognized. It was the key to the remote alpine cabin that I currently write this in, the one I am now situated in to hide out from the world.

You see, that thing let me live. 

In fact, as soon as it projected its mystical words and thoughts into my breaking mind, it even put those hooves underneath my arms to help me up, then pointed at the shattered door. I took one final, mournful gaze at the man who had raised me, then slunk out of the ranch like the coward I am.

Three hours later, I pulled into the cabin on the mountain that my father had left for me as his last gesture. I don’t know why I’m still alive – rather, why that thing kept me alive – but there are a few things I do know for certain about this goddamn shit of a mess.

One, I’ve no doubt that we brought our own doom upon ourselves. The singular word I was able to recall echoed so profoundly within me that, with a bit of tenacity I was able to determine was a Dine' word.

The word for Greed.

Secondly, the only reason I didn’t break utterly nor have taken my dread and sorrow to its eternally final, terminating form was because of what was on that piece of bloody paper. S’why I decided to type this all up. I guess that, and just ‘cause it’s keeping my mind occupied and stemming the tide of those…thoughts.

I keep looking at the scratchy handwriting of my father’s final words, the last gift he gave me. And perhaps, his most important lesson.

*Don’t be me, son. I love you. Don’t be me.*
