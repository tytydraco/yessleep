Did you know ruminants have four stomachs? That may not be a fun fact, but it’s the funnest fact you’ll find watching three hours of National Geographic while housesitting. When the Mayhughs go on their monthly trip up to the lodge, I’m almost always their first call. Their house is modest but nice enough. A mid-size colonial out in the countryside. 

Well, when I say “countryside,” I really mean a few neighbors are all that’s separating it from being in the middle of nowhere. Not that I’m complaining, though. A monthly retreat in the not-quite wilderness feels like my own little vacation. Plus, it’s got everything I have at home. Kitchen? Check. Bedroom? You bet. Bathroom? Quadruple check—fancy bastards. Living roo—you get it, it’s a house.

What I don’t have at home, however, is the view. Or four toilets. But mostly the view. A spacious deck overlooks about two acres of flat, open fields. At the far edge, a row of pine trees marks the beginning of a dense, impenetrable forest. I almost never see trees back in the city. Or stars, for that matter. It’s why my favorite spot in the house is a small, off-white sofa tucked in the corner of the Mayhughs’ living room. 

Don’t get me wrong, the sofa itself is ghastly. It has an illegally aggressive floral print, it’s yellowed with age (and god knows what else) and the back springs dig into you like the quills of a porcupine. But it has the perfect view of that yard through the sliding glass door. And as it’s a moonless night tonight, the stars above are especially bright.

You’ll have to pardon the rhyme. That Nat Geo special on even-toed ungulates just ended and now they’re playing a rerun of *Nature Explorers!,* a kid’s show which, if you haven’t seen it, brutally subjects its viewers to non-consensual rhyming. I’ve tried to file complaints to no avail and if I have to suffer through it, you do too. But seeing as it’s pushing midnight and every other channel at this time is either 90% erectile dysfunction commercial or 90% catheter commercial, I suppose *Nature Explorers!* is the lesser evil.

Then again, it is late and even I have my limits. So I grabbed a blanket, laid across the criminally uncomfortable couch, and clicked the remote just as Ranger Rick started a song about hippopotamuses. Or is it hippopotami? Well, guess I’ll never know—sorry Ranger Rick. I turned the TV off and nestled my head in its usual spot on the misshapen armrest. As my eyes grew heavy, I watched the silvery stars bathe the treetops in their incandescence, drifting into welcome oblivion.

I dreamt I was in a forest.

I was running. Cool navy blurred my vision as I fumbled helplessly through the thicket. Sharp thorns struggled for purchase as hundreds of greedy hooks tore into my flesh, desperate to halt my egress. 

This place was not for me. 

At last I came upon a clearing. The air was still and the sky starless; an inky-blue abyss judging me with its cold indifference. 

I should not be here. 

At the center of the clearing stood a large bonfire, surrounded by twelve. Men. Women. I couldn’t tell. Each wore a suit, a single rose affixed to their breast. They gazed deeply into resplendent flame.

As I approached that most minacious ensemble, words that were not my own clawed their way from the back of my throat. “Where is he?” I asked. “*What* is he?” I demanded an answer without understanding the question. The guests turned their heads in unison. A dozen faces stared at me, each behind a mask—wooden and eyeless. 

The hateful beacon spewed its progeny. As scarlet embers danced furiously in the void, I could make out but a single, shared expression beneath those masks. The guests were smiling. 

Something was behind me. 

*THUD.* 

I woke up in a sweat. 

*THUD.* 

*THUD.*

I pulled my face from the drool-speckled cushion and turned to the source of the noise. I screamed. Less than twenty feet away, a man stood behind the glass, blindfolded, pressing desperately against the door. His clothes were tattered and dirty. Black, sweat-soaked hair clung to his face and a million ruby beads strung the scratches adorning his skin. But even in that disheveled state, I recognized the derelict. 

“Jimmy?” I asked softly. He banged his fists against the door again. 

“Let me in!” he mouthed, the sound partially muted by glass. 

“Jimmy, what the fuck are you doing here?” I asked louder than before, but equally concerned. 

“J-Jennifer?” he started. “You…you have to let me in. Please, hurry.” 

“What the fuck happ—” 

“There’s no time, please!” I ran back to the couch, frantically searching for my phone. He banged on the door again. “Jennifer, please, let me in!” I extracted the phone from between the cushions and ran back to the door. “Hurry, Jen! Please!” 

“H-hold on” I said. “There’s a security code, I’ve just got to find—” 

“PLEASE LET ME IN!” he cried. I fumbled through the phone, desperately searching for Mrs. Mayhugh’s text. 

“Found it!” I said. I punched the code into the keypad and it chimed approvingly. Jimmy slid the door open and ran inside, knocking me to the ground. “Jimmy, what’s going on? Should I call the police?” I asked. He ignored me. As quickly as he had opened it, Jimmy slammed the door shut and ran his shaking hands against the wall. After a few seconds of panicked probing, he found what he was looking for. Waves of red fabric billowed across the door as the silk curtains were released from their hooks.

 I picked my phone up from the floor. It beeped distinctively as I typed in the number. “What are you doing?” asked Jimmy, exasperated. 

“What do you think? Calling the police” I said. 

“NO!” he screamed, knocking the phone out of my hand. 

“What the hell Jimmy? What the fuck is going on?” I asked, anger eclipsing my terror for the briefest of moments. “

We need to shut the blinds. All of them” he barked. 

“They’re already shut” I said. “The owners insisted. Something about energy effici—” Jimmy took a shaky breath and let out a sigh. His hands fumbled behind his head as he untied the blindfold. 

When the knot was finally loosed, he paused, and then gingerly lifted the cloth from his face. He hesitated for a moment before opening his eyes. When he did, they welled with tears. “Jimmy…” I began. It was no use. He collapsed to the floor in a fit of tears. He was hysterical. “It’s ok Jimmy, you’re safe” I said, not knowing if it was true. “Let me call the police, they’ll —” 

“No, you can’t!” he sobbed, his body heaving on the ground. 

“Ok, ok” I said. “Come here. Let me help you to the couch at least, it’s better than the floor” I assured him, not knowing if that was true either. He nodded weakly. 

Weaving my arm under his shoulders, I helped him to the still-warm sofa. By the time he was seated, the tears had mostly stopped. The purge of emotion, whatever had been its source, seemed to be complete. Unable to hold my fear-laced curiosity back any longer, I seized the opportunity. “What the hell are you doing here, Jimmy?” He sniffled. 

“I—,” he started. “I came back to see a friend.” Jimmy moved out of town a few months ago. We had a big going away party in Mr. Mallard’s  class and everything. But he knew perfectly well that wasn’t what I meant. 

“Mhmm,” I said. “But what are you doing *here*? You know, banging on the door, blindfolded and bloody, clothes torn to shit at three in the morning?” Jimmy looked to the ground in silence. “Ok” I sighed. “Can I get you anything? Some water? Bandages? Food? When’s the last time you ate?” 

“No, no I’m ok” he lied.

“What about a smoke? Do you still smoke? I’ve got a lighter in my—”

“I’m fine, really” he lied again. 

“You obviously aren’t fine, Jimmy.” Silence. “It’s ok,” I told him. “Is there anything I *can* get you? Anything I can do?” He hesitated. 

“There—,” he paused again. “There is something…” 

I grabbed a pillow from the couch and hit him with it. 

“Ow!” he cried. 

“Seriously, Jimmy?” 

“No! No, it’s not that—are you insane?” We both smiled. For a moment, the tension broke and he was back to the Jimmy I knew. But it was only just for a moment. 

“Alright then,” I said. “What do you need?” The smile on Jimmy’s face faded. 

“I—” he turned his head, unable to meet my gaze. “I need to tell you something.”

“Is this about what happened?” I asked. His lower lip began to quiver, words blocked by the lump in his throat. “Go ahead” I said. “It’s ok, you can tell me.” His eyes welled once more but this time he choked back the tears. 

“There’s something in the woods,” he said. “And it sounds like a goat.” He forced the words out, solemn as an executioner. I chuckled nervously. 

“Are you sure it’s not just a goat?” 

“No!” he said emphatically. “It’s not. It might sound like one from a distance, but…” he trailed off for a moment. “But it’s *not* a goat,” he finished. “And no matter what happens, you can’t—under any circumstances—look at it.” Jimmy paused, sensing my consternation.

I was worried. More so than before. Back in school—before Jimmy moved away—it was an open secret that he was a bit…off. Mentally, I mean. He was never violent or anything—didn’t go around assaulting people cause “the voices” told him to or whatever. He was a sweetheart. He even volunteered at the nursing home. But if he was ever off his meds, well…let’s just say he could get a bit paranoid.

“Jimmy…” I asked. “This isn’t another ‘wasp-lady’ incident again, is it?” He was clearly offended. 

“No!” he said. “It’s nothing like that—and you know Ms. Fletcher kept wearing that striped shirt on purpose!” 

“All right, all right” I said calmly. “But Jimmy, you said that this goat thing—” 

“It’s *not* a goat”

“Right, sorry. This not-goat thing. You said you can’t look at it?” Jimmy nodded. “So, does that mean you put that blindfold on yourself?” Another nod. “And these scrapes on your skin, the tears in your clothes—that’s because you were wandering in the woods? At night? By yourself? With a blindfold? That *you* put on?”

He hesitated before nodding once more, this time with a palpable tinge of shame. “I know how it sounds,” said Jimmy. “But you need to believe me. Please.” 

“I believe you.” I said. “But just so we’re clear…you are still on your meds, right?” He pursed his lips and the room went quiet. 

I had my answer.

“I need to go” Jimmy said, standing from his seat. 

“Wait, I’m sorry” I protested in vain. “I’m just trying to understand.” 

“It’s not that,” he said. “It’s just—I just need to leave.” Jimmy strode past the sofa searching for the front door. 

“Wait, let me call a cab at least. Or my dad. I can’t let you go out by yourself like this.” He ignored my pleas. 

“There isn’t time. It’s almost—I have to go. Now.” He winced as his scab-riddled hand closed around the doorknob and said, “I’m sorry I told you.” As Jimmy stepped onto the porch he paused, looking back over his shoulder. Through tear-stained eyes, his quivering lips mouthed one final message: “don’t look.” 

The door closed. I never saw Jimmy again.

After Jimmy left, I walked back to the kitchen. The Mayhughs update the security codes each month but lucky for me, the one password they never change is the wine cooler’s. I know, I know. I’m not twenty-one yet and it’s not very Christian of me to be drinking and whatever. Or Muslim. Or Buddhist, come to think of it. But after whatever the hell all *that* was, I think JC would let it slide this time. He’s all about forgiveness, right? So, in a way, it actually *is* pretty Christian of me to get wine-drunk unsupervised. These feelings aren’t gonna drown themselves after all.

After pouring myself a glas—who am I kidding, a bowl—of Barefoot (I could never stand the *Château Margaux* — too many notes of fuck-you-money) I found my way back to the sofa. First thing I thought of was to call the police. I’m not an idiot. But then again, maybe I am. Because as I typed the number into my phone, I hesitated. Jimmy was adamant I didn’t call them. I’m pretty sure I know why. 

Remember when I said that he was never violent or anything? That he didn’t go around assaulting people? Well, that was mostly true. Spraying Ms. Fletcher in the eyes with bug spray wasn’t technically assault — it was battery. But the bitch really was asking for it if you ask me. 

Unfortunately for Jimmy, the police didn’t agree. Gave us a huge lecture on how dangerous it was—toxic chemicals, flammable aerosols, yada yada. But after that, we all knew he was on thin ice. If I called the police, if Mr. Foster found out his son came all the way back to Clark’s Creek, running around the woods in the middle of the night talking about goats, he might actually institutionalize him this time. As unsettled as I was, I couldn’t risk that happening to Jimmy. Not yet at least.

I sighed and slid the phone into my pocket. Basin in hand, I went back to the couch to sit down an—*Click*. I jumped. Nearly spilling a bathtub’s worth of wine, the TV came to life. 

“*But I’m scared Ranger Rick! His teeth are so long...and his fur is soooo black!”* I looked down and saw a small, plastic obelisk protruding from under my thigh. 

“Idiot” I told myself. It was another episode of *Nature Explorers!* but I don’t think I’ve seen this one.

“*Why, that’s ok Jenny*” Rick said. *“Sometimes nature can be scary. But it’s also beautiful! And what do Nature Explorers always do?”*

 The kids answered in unison: *“We look!”* 

“*Ohhhh…*” Ohhh great, get ready for a song. 

“*Oh, when we feel small and scared inside—what do we do? Sit up! Stand tall! And open our eye—“ Click*. That was enough of that.

After the brutal assault on my ears, I suddenly remembered how much I detest that show. But more importantly, I also remembered I forgot to reset the security system after Jimmy left. I pulled up the code on my phone and made my way across the room. Parting the curtains, I began to enter the sequence when a soft note echoed through the glass.

*Baaaa…*

It was quiet. Almost inaudible. But it was there. 

“Hello?” I asked, peering through the door. Darkness. 

Against my better judgment, I flicked the switch and made my way onto the newly-illuminated deck. The strained wood groaned under my steps as cool, midsummer-night air kissed my skin. 

“Jimmy, is that you?” I said, knowing perfectly well it wasn’t. I waited.

*Baaaa…*

This time it didn’t sound like a goat. It sounded like someone *pretending* to be a goat. And despite that bizarre syllable, I could clearly tell who it was. 

“Nice try, Jimmy” I said, sighing with relief. “You really got me. Congrats. Go on, let’s hear another.” I smiled, waiting for a reply. Silence. And then, my smile dropped.

A shrill, otherworldly cry flooded the air. Distorted. Like an elk in heat, or a dying caribou. I tried to drown out the noise in vain; the fell sound pierced me to the core. Hands over ears, I ran back into the house, slammed the door closed and shut the curtains. Through them, the lights bathed the room in a soft, crimson glow. 

I punched nine digits into the keypad to arm the system and then three more into my phone. I waited with bated breath as it rang.

“9-1-1, please state your emergency” I heard at last. 

“Hello? Yes, I’m at 66 McGuffey Lane—the Mayhughs’ place. I think there’s a wild animal outside in the yard.” 

“A wild animal?” 

“Yes, I think so. I thought it was a goat at first but—” 

“Are you sure it’s not a goat?” 

"Yes I’m sure it’s not a goat! I know what a fucking goat sounds like, asshole, and it’s *not* fucking that!” I yelled. 

“All right, all right miss. Can you describe the animal, then?”

“It sounded like an elk maybe—” 

“An elk? We don’t have elk ‘round these parts…” they said, interrupting again. 

“Yeah, no shit. That’s why I’m freaked the fuck out! Look, can you just send an officer or something? Or animal control?” I asked. 

“Of course, ma’am” they replied. “But they’re gonna need a better description than that.” 

“I—I didn’t get a good look.” I said. 

“Well, can you?” They asked. 

“I…” I paused. “I don’t think I should.” Silence. After a long pause, they finally answered. 

“Look at him, Jennifer.”

I launched my phone across the room in a panic. Looking to the ground, I saw Jimmy’s blindfold. It was torn from a t-shirt, still wet with sweat. I reached down to pick it up but before I could, a noise bellowed from the door. Unmistakable. 

The sound of hooves. 

 *Clop. Clop. Clop.* 

The stressed wood screeched fanfare for the vile cavalcade. But then it stopped. Darkness enveloped me as I turned around. Behind the silk stood a shadow, about seven feet tall. An amorphous silhouette, illuminated by the curtain’s crimson glow. From it, I could make out a single detail. Two long, curved horns crowned each side of its rorschach head.

I was petrified. And then, I was dizzy. My vision began to blur. By the time it cleared, I was standing right in front of the door. A fistful of silk in my hand, ready to part the veil. I released the ball of fabric and pulled my hand away. The house began to shake.

*THUD.* 

I jumped back. Whatever that thing was, it was trying to get in. 

*THUD.* 

*THUD.* 

I couldn’t move. But I knew the door wouldn’t hold long. 

*THUD.* 

*THUD.* 

*Crack.*

I made a beeline for the front door. I tried the knob but to no avail. The system was still armed. I reached in my pocket for the code, but then—*shit.* I tossed my phone. *Fucking idiot!* I tried typing it from memory. 

5-1-8-0-1-0-9-2-0. 

It chimed angrily. 

5-1-8-0-6-0-9-1-0. 

Wrong again. 

5-1-8-1-5-0-5-0-7? 

“Shit!” I cried. “Fucking Mayhughs!” I cursed, tears streaming down my face. In response, the shrill sound of breaking glass. 

Arm over eyes, I turned around and ran up the stairs. I dashed quietly down the hallway and took refuge in the room at the end. I closed the door, locking it gingerly, and scanned my surroundings. It was the Mayhughs’ bedroom. 

The floor was covered in neat, berber carpet. The furniture, all matching mahogany. On the far nightstand, a vibrant Tiffany lamp stood behind an old, radio alarm clock. And directly opposite the door, I saw my pale reflection trembling in a tall, hanging mirror. *Shit*. I hurried over to the dresser and opened the top drawer. 

Before me lay rows of socks folded neatly into bundles. I grabbed the darkest pair I could find, crouched behind the bed and quickly assembled the makeshift blindfold. Gazing into the welcome void, I let out a shaky breath.

Suddenly, the radio flickered. 

“*That was ‘Take a peek!’ by Reggie Del Mar,”* the voice said. 

*“Next up, we have a very special message for a verrrry special girl.”* The host continued, its next words spoken like those of a spiteful friend. 

*“Don’t make him hurt you, Jennifer*.” 

My blood went cold. 

*“He doesn’t want to hurt you! All he wants is for you to look.”* I rushed to the radio, probing the path with outstretched arms. 

*“The richest silks; the sweetest flowers; the most marvelous melodies!*” My hands wrapped around the cord as I prepared to choke off the signal. 

*“The answers to all the questions you’ve ever had and ever will have. All you have to do, is loo—”*  

I yanked and the voice went silent. The room began to spin. And then, hot, heavy breath moistened the back of my neck. Sweet and vile. Like cinnamon and sulfur. 

I felt the bones rattle in my flesh as a raspy, preternatural voice uttered just three words. 

“*Look. At. Me.*”

Adrenaline coursing through my veins, I flailed my hands in search of something—anything—to grasp. Next to me, a vase on a shelf. Good enough. I clutched the vessel and slammed it against the mass, its shattered pieces reverberating with force. The creature was unfazed. It simply repeated itself in that inhuman voice, inhaling with each syllable. 

“*Look. At. Me.*” 

Tears stained my cheeks. All I could do was gently shake my head.

A great weight struck me, my ribs popping under its force like twigs. As a broken angel, I soared across the room, Icarian-like, until a bed of glass broke my fall. Sharp pain was followed by wet warmth. Shards of mirror stuck from my back like the quills of a bloody porcupine. As the great weight returned, the spines dug deeper—pain erupting from my thigh. 

“*What do nature explorers do?*” it asked, the facsimile riddled with static. 

My flesh shred to wet ribbons as the creature lifted me slowly against the wall.  In the static-laced refrain of a dozen, jubilant children, it said: 

“*We Look!*”

Pinholes of light dotted my vision as the blindfold began to tear. Thread snapping after thread, I guided my hand to the closest source of red-hot pain. With a final surge of adrenaline, I squeezed my palm around the jagged, blood-slicked dagger and closed my eyes. As the blindfold broke, I pulled the shard from my gushing thigh and plunged it deep into the creature. 

Thick, hot ooze coated my hand as an overpowering smell flooded the room. Metallic and fragrant, like rusty rosewater. I fell to the ground as the creature let out an ear-splitting cry. Trampling over broken glass, I ran for the exit.

Down the hall I found an open door and rushed inside. Locking the portal behind me, I cautiously opened my eyes to one of the guest bathrooms. I immediately ran to the sink to rinse the stinging ooze from my hand, staining the porcelain a blackened red. I reached into my pocket to extract what was left of the blindfold and then, I felt it. Cool, smooth metal. My eyes widened. 

I reached for the mirrored cabinet above the painted basin. After rummaging through its messy shelves, I found my prize. Reaching for the brushed cylinder, I grew lightheaded as the edges of my vision gave way to darkness. I snapped awake. Suddenly, my dripping hand was stretched in front of the mirror. On it, bloody letters spelled three words.

The room began to shake. Dust fell from the ceiling as the door pulsed behind me. In a frenzy, I reached to recover the bottle of hairspray from the ground. *“LOOK AT ME!”* the thing cried. 

*“LOOK AT ME! "*

*"LOOK AT ME!"*

*"LOOK AT ME!”* 

Each time it spoke with a different, ever-more desperate voice. Jimmy’s. The Mayhughs’. My mother’s. My own. My shaking thumb fumbled desperately as it struck the striker again and again. The door began to splinter. Just as two black horns breached the frame, I pressed my eyelids so tight I thought the sacks of jelly beneath them were going to burst. First there was darkness. And then, light.

As the canister discharged, the mote in my hand erupted into a ball of fire. Even through my eyelids I could see the blaze: a dark silhouette enveloped by the hot glow of promethean flame. A cacophony of anger and agony filled the room as the walking inferno retreated. As my vision cooled and the deafening screams grew fainter, I made for my escape.

Pace after bloody pace, I moved over cloven-scorched ground. My eviscerated feet screamed with each step and then, so did I. With one false move the ground vanished and I found myself tumbling down the wooden stairs, landing with a hideous, gory *snap.* 

I tried to get up but my right leg collapsed under my weight. With all my strength, I dragged myself across the cool tile. Warm blood lubricated the path until my outstretched arms grasped a windowsill. Using the leverage, I brought myself upright and ran my free hand against the wall. I was at the front window.

I choked on the taste of ash as smoke spread throughout the house. I prodded the air with my hand and felt a table next to me. On it, a heavy, stone lamp. I picked it up and with all my might, I slammed it into the glass. 

*THUD.* 

Again. 

*THUD.* 

Please god, please. 

*THUD.* 

*THUD.* 

The room began to fade, thick smoke filling my lungs. 

*THUD.*

With one last shallow breath, I screamed  “FUCK YOU JIMMY FOSTER!” and drove the lamp through the window. 

The barrier broke into a million pieces, jagged teeth slicing me as I slid through the frame. I landed onto the dewy, early morning grass and gasped for fresh air. Clearing the smoke from my lungs, I crawled forward until—*crack*.

I screamed. Sharp, singular pain reverberated through my very being. The worst pain I’ve ever felt. I turned my shaking head and cautiously peeked at the ground behind me. Protruding from my right leg, a smooth, pearly rod was snagged into the turf. Bile rose in my throat. Choking it down, I kicked my leg backwards in a single, odious jerk and dislodged the bone from the soil. 

After fifteen excruciating minutes, I made my way to the road. Rolling over the wet asphalt, at last I opened my eyes. Cassiopeia. Boötes. The Big Dipper. All illuminated from below by the smoldering home. From the corner of my eyes, dark figures formed a crowd around me. My breath began to slow. I gazed into that fading, celestial canopy as darkness swallowed it whole.

I dreamt I was in a clearing.

Twenty-four arms around a beacon did raise. From that circle of flesh stepped forth one in praise.

In their hands, a book of faith. From it they read, that sordid wraith,

Through eyeless mask, a pantomime;  The words they spoke were long-ago pined:

“*By froth and flame do we aspire;* *Imbibe ourselves the black-one’s ichor!*”

A coda to the creed, they did cry

“*Shem-ha-Mephorash!*”

Into moonless sky.

I woke up to a sterile hum and my eyes filled with icy fluorescence. I looked around. Leg brace? Check. Blood transfusion? You bet. Painkillers? Quadruple fucking check — it was awesome. Little cup of jell—you get it, it’s a hospital. 

The doctors said it was the neighbors who found me first. When they came to investigate the blaze, they found me passed out in the middle of the road. If Mr. Johnson hadn’t put that tourniquet on me when he did, doctor says I would have bled out. So, shoutout to Mr. Johnson I guess.

The first ones to come see me were the Mayhughs (thanks dad, truly father of the year). Well, Mr. Mayhugh at least. Allison was at an emergency meeting with her life coach to discuss “next steps,” whatever the fuck that means—fancy bastards. But she did send some cookies and a nice bouquet. They were surprisingly understanding about the situation. 

“Don’t worry, Jen” Mr. Mayhugh said.

“We know it wasn’t your fault. Besides, it was just a summer home—we live out in the condo most of the time anyways.” He was trying to reassure me, but I knew that behind the brave face he was just as broken up about it as Mrs. Mayhugh.

“It is a shame about that couch though,” he added. “Worth a fortune.”

Next up was the police. They asked me what happened. I asked them the same.

“Dispatch received a call around 12:00 am from the Mayhughs’ place, but the line was dead” they said. “We went out to investigate but by the time we got there, place was already up in flames.” I grabbed the pack of green goo in front of me and took a tentative sip. Lime. Worst flavor.

“Your turn, miss,” said the officer.

I couldn’t tell them the truth of course. Best case, they’d think I went crazy from all that smoke inhalation. Worst case, they’d think I was lying and grow suspicious. Either way, they’d never believe me. And I was not about to risk becoming an arson suspect.

A part of me feels a little bad about Jimmy. But another part of me feels like if you’re gonna lead a surprisingly flammable goat demon to your friend, the least you can do is take the fall for the insurance.

It’s been two months since the incident and I still haven’t told anyone what really happened. Aside from my therapist, that is. Dad made me see one after I kept waking up screaming in the middle of the night—bit of an overreaction, if you ask me—but based on how she responded when I told her, I knew not telling the cops was the right move.

I’m on a shit ton of meds now. Painkillers for the leg. Sleeping pills for the nightmares. Antipsychotics for the truth. Fine with me. The less I remember about that night at the Mayhughs’, the better. And to be honest, it was working. In fact, I had almost completely forgotten the sound I heard that—that thing—make.

Almost.

It’s 11:00 pm now. Almost two months to the day. And as I sit here by my window, gazing into that barren city sky as I drift off to sleep, I lurch awake. A soft note echoes through the air.

I should be terrified. I am terrified. But I also know what I have to do. I’ve known since my therapist stopped answering my calls a month ago. Since I realized why Jimmy was so upset that night. Why he was sorry for telling me.

I didn’t want to do this, I promise. But I don’t have a choice. I can’t face that thing again. I just can’t. To whoever’s reading this, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.  But when it comes for you, just remember.

No matter what happens.

No matter what it says.

Or how badly it tries to tempt you.

Do. Not. Look.
