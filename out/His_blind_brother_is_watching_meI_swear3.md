The next day I woke up in the guest room bed. The taste of turpentine and blood still lingered on my tongue. I could remember everything—the slug, the hollowed eyes—but now I was surrounded by clean sheets. My body felt bathed… but also violated. Not even the pomegranate scent in the air could mask what clung to my bare skin.

In the silence I couldn’t feel anything but anger—anger directed at Ethan for bringing me here to his fucked-up family, for handing me over like I was nothing. And yet, beneath the fury, something else gnawed at me. I couldn’t even name it properly. It wrapped around me like fire and disgust and guilt all at once. It felt like being claimed.

A knock jolted me. The door cracked open and Mary poked her head in, wearing that cheerful, motherly smile.
“Oh, great—you’re up. I was just about to get you.”

“W-what’s going on?” I asked, confused.

“Why, it’s going to be your first family brunch,” she said brightly as she entered the room. She moved to the closet, retrieving clothes, and without hesitation uncovered me, pulling away the sheets. The cold air attacked my skin and I curled up, but she tugged me upright and pressed an outfit into my hands: an extra-large, faded band shirt (the image worn to the point of being unrecognizable) and pajama bottoms decorated with pastel cartoon characters.

“We have so much to discuss, my sweet little child. I’ll be right outside… and please hurry. Lucas doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”

She closed the door behind her. I could hear her body press against the frame, listening, waiting. The moment she spoke Lucas’s name, I was already moving. My body obeyed before my mind did. Dressing quickly, stepping out, letting her slip her arm under mine and caress my face, she escorted me down the hall like I was hers.

The family dining room opened before us.

Ethan was slouched in his chair, arms mapped with a thousand thin cuts, some shallow, some deep, his forearms bleeding sluggishly into a pan below, collecting into a pool that looked equal parts oil and blood.
Frank sat at the head of the table with his usual dull expression, unreadable but heavy.
And Lucas—wrapped in white bandages, the beautiful monstrosities of his eyes hidden beneath. He smiled wide, ear to ear.

“Morning, sis,” he said, almost sing-song. “Take a seat. We have a lot to say… and I have a list for you to complete.”

Mary and I obeyed. She seated herself gently while I sat across from Lucas, beside Ethan, who looked at me with quiet condolences. I didn’t acknowledge him. I only braced myself for what was coming.

That’s when Frank tossed an envelope in front of me. It landed with a light tap on the wood. I opened it. Inside were my records—but altered. My birth certificate, my information, rewritten. My past, erased.

I looked to Lucas for answers. Even with his eyes covered, I knew he would give them.

He sighed deeply, then spoke.
“Not much to say. We have to make all these lies believable if we’re going to sell them as truth. And to be honest? I don’t usually… choose. But something tells me you’ll be more useful than these fucks.”

Mary lowered her head. Ethan recoiled in his chair. Frank stayed still, expressionless—but something in his posture cracked.

“This isn’t going to work,” I scoffed. “People will look for me. My mother, my family, hell—even law enforcement. How do you think you’ll get away with this?”

Lucas smirked, adjusting himself in his chair, straightening his posture.
“Well, that’s your first school lesson. You’re going to lure everyone you know… bring them here, and—”

“And what? Join the family?” I cut him off. “I hate to burst your bubble, but that wouldn’t even make sense—”

“Sacrifice them. Don’t interrupt me again.”

He said it so calmly that it rattled me.

“You can’t be serious,” I whispered. “You’ll make a trail of missing persons a mile long. That’s not smart.”

Lucas only shrugged. “It’s not my first time infiltrating a family.”

Ethan snapped his head up, his rage visible, burning holes into Lucas. Mary laughed softly and leaned against Frank’s shoulder. And Frank… for the first time, Frank looked rattled. He didn’t pull Mary closer, didn’t look at Lucas—he just stared down at the table, shame flickering across his face.

The silence cracked with Lucas’s low chuckle.
“But I’m not talking in that sense. No, no, no. If I did, everyone would start seeing the web of bullshit. Just bring them here, and I’ll handle the rest. Starting with your immediate family. And maybe… if you do a good enough job… there might be a seat for you after all.”

Curiosity twisted through me, even as fear curdled in my stomach. A seat. What happened to the others who had seats before me?

“What’s going to happen to them—if I do bring them here?”

“Well, I’ll make them see the light!” he said, his tone almost mock-preachy.

“And if they refuse?” My voice quivered. “If they won’t… ‘see the light’? If they won’t even agree to come?”

“Trust me. They’ll have that choice. I gave you a gift. Use it.”

As he said it, I felt it—my skull tightening, pressure swirling inside like something crawling under bone. The sensation was soothing, almost pleasurable, and yet filled me with primal fear.

“And if I refuse?” I asked, but my voice was barely a whisper now, shaking.

Lucas leaned forward, his chin resting in his palm like a bored schoolteacher. His fingers tapped rhythmically against the table.
“Well. Everyone here has a role. You either play your part, keep yourself useful… or—”

The tapping grew sharper, louder. The pressure in my skull turned into a stabbing headache, my eyes throbbing like they might burst. My mind reeled with visions: twisted bodies, painted in torment on his canvases; Ethan’s blood dripping into the pan below; Mary smiling while cradling something broken.

“—what’s it gonna be?” Lucas asked softly, fingers hammering the wood. “Because no is not an option you want to explore.”

The pain surged. My head felt like it would split open.
“O-okay! Okay, I’ll do it, I’ll do it—” I repeated the words over and over until the tapping ceased, and the pain receded.

“Good girl.” His voice was honey. “Now. Mother, why don’t you serve us brunch? These two have a long day ahead.”

“Of course!” Mary chirped. She lifted her head from Frank’s shoulder and practically skipped to the kitchen.

The smell of food soon crept in, warm and homely, mixing with the dread and the aftertaste of Lucas’s praise. For a brief, sick moment, it felt almost comforting.

But beneath that, a question gnawed at me: how was I going to stay useful?
————-

As the food was served, everyone ate in silence. Forks scraping plates, chewing muffled. The pressure in my skull pulsed with every bite, thoughts spiraling until one slipped out of my mouth before I could stop it:

“D-does everyone at this table… have a bug in them?”

The words landed heavy, but the others didn’t flinch. They just looked at me expectantly, as though I’d asked something as ordinary as pass the salt.

Lucas smirked, turning his bandaged head toward Frank.

“M-most of us,” Frank muttered, stuffing food into his mouth too quickly.

“Most of you? What does that mean?” I asked.

He dabbed his beard with a napkin, his dull eyes fixing on mine.
“Only the ones Lucas deems fit to bear it. I had one once… and he blessed me, made me his shepherd. To lead the flock. To have a wife.”

He placed a hand on Mary’s cheek. She leaned into it, her smile tender, almost radiant.

I turned to her. “So you have one too?”

“Oh, of course,” she said, almost proudly. “Ethan brought me here not long before you showed up.”

I looked at Ethan. His face was tight, jaw trembling, eyes locked on the plate. His neck veins bulged with suppressed rage. He couldn’t even lift his fork.

Then—CRACK.

Lucas slammed his hand against the table, making every plate jump.

“Feed your brother,” he said calmly, smiling too wide. “Before he pisses me off.”

He rose from his seat, grabbed the shallow pan beneath Ethan—the grotesque mix of oil and his blood, plucking the scraps of fallen food floating out—and carried it into the garage. When he returned, he sat back down as if nothing had happened.

My stomach twisted. I groaned, picked up Ethan’s utensils, and began feeding him mouthfuls. He chewed slowly, shame dripping from his every glance.

“Ugh,” I hissed. “Don’t look at me like that.”

I turned back to Frank. “You said most of you have a bug. If you have one, and Mary has one… who doesn’t?”

Before Frank could answer, Lucas cut in, voice mocking.
“Isn’t it obvious? Are you really that dense, or do you just want to hear it out loud?”

I froze. Then I looked back at Ethan. My hand set the fork down.

Ethan broke. His sobs came raw, ragged. “I didn’t want it. I thought… if I could just put someone else in my place, maybe I could still be useful. I saw what happened to Mom… the pact with Dad… I couldn’t…”

Mary reached across the table, touching his cheek softly.
“Honey, I’m right here.”

Ethan jerked away. “Not you. I’m talking about my mother.”

His voice cracked, and he turned his gaze to Frank. The look that passed between them was a blade—Ethan’s full of accusation, Frank’s sharp with warning.

Lucas shifted his head toward Ethan. Though his eyes were wrapped in white, his attention cut through the bandages like heat. He continued to eat slowly, deliberately, as though savoring nostalgia.

Every instinct screamed at me to stay quiet. But something else pushed me forward.
“What the fuck happened?” I asked.

Silence collapsed over the table.

Mary broke it with a sing-song cheeriness, her tone brittle.
“There’s no need to dredge up old tales. We’re a family now! We should be happier. Besides…” she reached for Frank’s arm, “Frank is a strong man who’s been through so much. He doesn’t need to explain himself, right honey?”

Frank leaned down and kissed her forehead tenderly. But his eyes—his eyes never left Ethan. They burned with menace, with a silent command: say nothing more.
——-
Lucas let out a low hum that seemed to vibrate through the air, making the silence itself levitate.
“I think storytelling time is over,” he said, rising from the table.

He carried his dish into the kitchen and began rinsing it, the water hissing against porcelain. Without turning toward me, he spoke again, his voice casual but carrying weight that pinned me to my chair.
“Patch up your brother. Tomorrow, you two are going to visit your old mother. And don’t take too long trying to convince her to come here. As much as I value patience…” he paused, “…I hate waiting.”

He disappeared into the garage, the door closing behind him with a dull click.

The room exhaled. We gathered around Ethan, tending to his arms, wrapping each laceration in antiseptic and gauze. His sobs came broken and wet, his body trembling under our hands.

The sight twisted something inside me. The words slipped out before I could stop them.
“…Coward.”

Mary hushed him, stroking his hair with that warped tenderness of hers.
“See, honey? That’s why you shouldn’t throw chairs at your brother. You only end up hurting yourself.”

Her voice was syrup, her smile serene, as if none of this—blood, shame, orders from a blind god—was anything more than a domestic squabble.
