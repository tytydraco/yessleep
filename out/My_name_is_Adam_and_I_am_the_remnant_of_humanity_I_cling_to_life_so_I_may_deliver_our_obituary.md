The moon landing was a mistake and I don’t care who disagrees. Any good that came out of it was superseded by what those rockets stoked. No one has ever agreed with me on this notion, but I got the last say.

I’m lying down in the last building, in the final edifice of our civilization, and I am by myself. Only the light and I remain in the church that I once worshipped at – the light from the cracked ceiling, that is. The moon and I are locked in a staring contest and I can’t help but laugh at myself; in those last days, I was one of the few who didn’t hold to its symbol. The masses had taken it to mean humanity’s unity in the path of a greater cause, but I was personally never drawn in. I had my own beliefs about the world and our place in it. Maybe that’s why they spared me. Will that last, now that it’s my companion?

The din of their killing machines grows louder by the day. Was I kept alive out of mercy or sadism? Maybe the invaders had hearts that were invisible under their colorless skin. May I project the hope that their children will spare our history? That they’ll recover what they can – this message included – and teach their youth not to repeat the evils we faced?

Haha. As if anything could be saved anymore.

I mourn the life I could have lived if the star people had left us be. I mourn that my grandparents saw the greatest place on Earth destroyed. Could you believe that billions strived to be like us before the invasion? Before we were reduced to engines and organs. Before they ignored us.

Crudely, we ended up better off. It is a fact: we retained ourselves and they did not. Everyone else underwent a transformation into the alien. I don’t know the means of how it happened but their form became indistinguishable. In this macabre relay race, as the first invaders left Earth for another world, our former brethren took up their positions.

The Moon beckons me to invoke it again. It was a good friend who let me bare my chest. We were joined by an uncertain future and the duty to illuminate a universe. Mine, niche as it is, will be fulfilled through recounting our collective tale. I confessed in my prayers that I was woefully unprepared, that it was a mission I could neither adequately start nor end, but a voice inside me bellowed that the minutiae didn’t matter. These were our commonalities and I want you to remember them well: we were all victims and we all lived under the same sky.


The din is now deafening. A new cacophony has emerged, integrating the explosive elements. If their ideations have neared completion, then may this final testament reach someone. Lament me and the cadaver of humanity. Lament the nocturnal sentinel, the overhead satellite, the hole of light. I recall a moon lover teaching me the difference between living and surviving. He never regretted us setting foot on its surface for a second. If I had more days, I think I would have grown to be like him. Is that why their drones are closing in?

Let this be the final line of history: it’s a crescent-lit midnight in Gaza, and there’s a rocket in the sky; the moon is so pretty, and it is my witness.
