I moved into an apartment with my roommate Frankie in upstate New York. The first night we stayed there I felt uneasy each time l used the bathroom. No it wasn’t cause I’m lactose intolerant. 

Day 1

It was the first time I stayed somewhere where it had an actual bathtub. I went to the Lush Store and bought all types of bathbomb. I was so excited to take my first bath like ever.  

I did a lot of shopping so I ended up getting home pretty late. My roommate Frankie does Uber as his main source of income, which is pretty decent cause it’s pretty busy out here during the night. So when I got home he was already out for the night. I decided to test one of the bath bombs. I put in my favorite Taylor Swift album and started filling up the bath. Thank god the apartment came with a plug for the bath cause I didn’t think about buying one earlier. 

Finally it was time to dip in. I before i sunk into the bath I made sure to leave the bathroom door open. For some reason my brain was telling me to do so. I slowly lower myself into the warm lavender scented bath water. 

I’m laying in the water listening to Taylor’s album  Folklore for about 15 mins now. I noticed the water has went down a significant amount. A cold breeze swirls in the room giving me the chills. 5 more mins and I’ll get out.

Day 2 

I wake up to Frankie in the kitchen making breakfast. He ask me if I somehow clogged the drain in the bath yesterday with my fancy  bath bombs. I told it my bath drained just fine. He said it was draining slowly. I assured him I’ll get some drain-o later when I go get some groceries. 

I came home around the same time and I noticed Frankie left the bathroom light on. I went in to shut it off a saw the bath was filled with about an inch of water. He probably took a shower and it didn’t drain before he left. I decided to grab then drain-o and put the spout of the bottle in the drain and squeeze it. Hopefully replace some of the water in there with the ammonia smelling liquid. 

When I did that the bottle shot up out of my hand and landed by the toilet. I jumped back shocked at what just happened. I looked in the drain just to see hair slowly seep up from the drain. Maybe the pressure made the hair of the previous owners come up. But it came coming up and up. It looked like a wig at this point. Then I saw it. An Eye looking up at me between the hairs from the drain. 

Day 3 2:59 am

I woke up from the couch to Frankie in the bathroom screaming. It was still dark out, why was he home so early. I got up and slowly walked to the bathroom. The door was cracked open. I peered in and saw his shadow through the shower curtain. I asked him if we was ok, he replied “yes why wouldn’t I” I told him how I just heard him scream. He said I must be hearing things. I leaned against the sink and told him It must’ve happened in my sleep. I explained the weird dream I had about the drain having hair gushing out and the eye looking back at me. Then I heard the front door open and Frankie mumbled under his breath “slow fucking night” 
I looked over in horror at the shower curtain and slowly pushed it aside.
