I moved into an apartment with my roommate Frankie in upstate New York. The first night we stayed there I felt uneasy each time l used the bathroom. No it wasn’t cause I’m lactose intolerant. 



It was the first time I stayed somewhere where it had an actual bathtub. I went to the Lush Store and bought all types of bathbomb. I was so excited to take my first bath like ever.  

I did a lot of shopping so I ended up getting home pretty late. My roommate Frankie does Uber as his main source of income, which is pretty decent cause it’s pretty busy out here during the night. So when I got home he was already out for the night. I decided to test one of the bath bombs. 

Finally it was time to dip in. Before I sunk into the bath I made sure to leave the bathroom door open. For some reason my brain was telling me to do so. I slowly lower myself into the warm lavender scented bath water. 

I’m lying in the water listening to a true crime podcast. I noticed the water has went down a significant amount and felt something tickling my toes by the drain. A cold breeze swirls in the room giving me the chills. Bubbles started forming at the end of the bath by the spout and drain. Which was weird as fuck. 

As I start draining the bath I notice the flow is going pretty slow. Once the water is shallow enough to see the drain I notice there’s clumps of hair clogging it. I use the backside of my hair brush to scoop it out. It was long black hair. Me and Frankie both had short hair. 

 

I wake up to Frankie in the kitchen making breakfast. He ask me if I somehow clogged the drain in the bath yesterday with my fancy bath bombs. I told him my bath drained just fine once I scooped out the weird long black hair. He said it was draining slowly. I assured him I’ll get some drain-o later when I go get some groceries. 

I came home around the same time as I did yesterday and I noticed Frankie left the bathroom light on. I went in to shut it off a saw the bath was filled with about an inch of water, clogged with the black hair again. He probably took a shower and it didn’t drain before he left. I decided to grab then drain-o and put the spout of the bottle in the drain and squeeze it. Hopefully replace some of the water in there with the ammonia smelling liquid. 

When I did that the bottle shot up out of my hand and landed by the toilet. I jumped back shocked at what just happened. I looked in the drain just to see hair slowly seep up from the drain. Maybe the pressure made the hair of the previous owners come up. But it kept coming up and up. It looked like a wig at this point. Then I saw it. An Eye looking up at me between the hairs from the drain. 



I woke up from the couch to Frankie in the bathroom screaming. It was still dark out, why was he home so early. I looked at my phone and it was 2:59 am. I got up and slowly walked to the bathroom. The door was cracked open. I peered in and saw his shadow through the shower curtain. I asked him if we was ok, he replied “yes why wouldn’t I” I told him how I just heard him scream. He said I must be hearing things. I leaned against the sink and told him It must’ve happened in my sleep. I explained the weird dream I had about the drain having hair gushing out and the eye looking back at me. Then I heard the front door open and Frankie mumbled under his breath “slow fucking night” 

I looked over in horror at the shower curtain and slowly pushed it aside. As I did, something fell into the water. As I looked down it was a ball of the black hair floating in a swirl. I ran out and Frankie looked confused on why I looked so horrified. I explained what happened and he thought I was pulling a prank on him.

As he went in the bathroom I stood a few feet away from the door. He looked in the bath and said “wow what kind of bath bomb did you get, it turned the water pitch black … dope as fuck” I told him to step away from the tub that I didn’t use a bath bomb nor filled it with water. 

Again he thought I was playing a prank and put his hand in to unplug the bath to drain it. I stood there confused thinking I was imagining shit. As I was about to walk away I heard a big splash. 

I turned around and Frankie was no where to be seen. I look in the direction of the bath. Slowly a head emerged, face was covered by the black hair. What in the grudge type shit was this. I didn’t hesitate to start running towards the door. As I flung the door open there was Frankie standing about to put his keys in. I pushed him aside thinking , was this another trick or some shit. As I ran down the spiral staircase Frankie’s body fell down the middle between the stair railings slamming into the main floor. 

I froze. I look up between the railings and see the long haired woman standing at the top of the stairs slowly walking down. As I turn to run down the stairs she’s staring right at me in the face.
