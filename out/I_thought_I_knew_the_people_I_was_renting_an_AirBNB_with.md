Writing this now so I don’t forget everything that happened tonight, all names/places have been changed for sake of animosity.

I (31 m) travelled to Austin, Texas a few days ago to attend a film festival. I flew alone from my home in Ontario, Canada and met up with the director (Jeff, 35m), lead actor (Taylor, 33 m) and editor (David 34m) in Texas and am sharing an Air BNB with them all. I’ve been here for 6 days and so far, it’s been a great trip. This last night here took an odd turn at the end though…

The end of the film festival brought along a filmmaker networking event at a local bar that had been converted from an old post office. It was a great event- Taylor, our lead actor had his eyes out for a girl he’d been chatting up previously at the festival, in hopes to get her contact info. Quick explanation of Taylor- he’s one of the most intense human beings I’ve ever met- I don’t mean that negatively. He’s genuine, has a loud laugh, always wants to make a joke to get a laugh from others, extremely caring and thoughtful to his fellow crew members, just that kind of fun loving guy. He’s 6 foot 4 and a very strong action hero looking kinda guy. Jeff and David are long time best friends, and have been long friends with Taylor for 15+ years. I only met them all when I was hired for the project, a year and a half ago.

At this point in the trip, David had already flown home to get back to his job, but before he left there was weird tension between him and Jeff. They didn’t speak to it too much but I did get a long earful on how Jeff sometimes felt about David after he had left. Anyways, it’s me, Jeff and Taylor at this bar, and we had a great time. Met lots of new people, networked, all that stuff. But, Taylor did not find that girl he was looking for. He claimed he saw her in the karaoke room from afar but lost track of her when she left the room. 

We’re on a bus heading back to our Air BNB and I’m sitting with Jeff, just chatting about how the festival went, other movies, etc. As I’m talking to him I notice behind him across the aisle where Taylor is sitting alone, he’s got his head up against the window looking very stoic, and he’s muttering things to himself. Almost like he was having a conversation. Jeff follows my eyes and turns back to me:

“Oh, yeah he’s having another one of his bi-polar slips.”

Me: “Taylor is bi-polar?”

“Yeah, but he’s got a pretty good handle on it. But it’s usually when he’s been drinking a lot of whiskey when these ‘slips’ happen. You just need to leave him be, he’s working things out.”

Me: “What would he be working out?”

“Well he was really hoping to get that girls info, and we fly back tomorrow so looks like he’s just really disappointed.” Jeff shrugged, and that’s when we hit our stop. 

Flash forward to us getting in and settling, once we had arrived at the stop, Taylor was his regular self. Obviously I didn’t touch on him talking to the window out of respect.

I need to give you a layout of this townhouse we’re renting.
When you enter from the outside balcony where the main entrance is, the stairs are immediately in front of you. The stairs case goes straight up to the next floor and essentially splits the house in two. To the left of the stairs is the living room area with the TV, and to the right of the stairs was a dining room separated from the kitchen with U shaped counter. Very small. And to get to the bathroom on the main floor, you would go right, make an immediate left and go past the dining area and kitchen and you’ll find the bathroom under the stairs to the left of the kitchen. I hope that makes sense. Also, because we were all broke af, we had rented a place that didn’t have enough rooms. So I was actually sleeping on a mattress on the ground beside the dining room table, sandwiched between the wall and the table. The foot of my mattress pointed into the living room just beyond the main entrance and the bottom of the stairs. 



So we’re back from the bar and at this point Jeff and I are outside smoking a cigarette, Taylor is inside on the couch watching a youtube movie reviewer, laughing at the jokes being made. Jeff and I come back inside and Jeff points at the Youtuber on the screen and claims:

“This guy’s trash man, I told you not to watch his shitty reviews.”

Taylor: “He’s got a few good points sometimes though-“

Jeff: *Cutting him off* “No he doesn’t! He says outrageous things for knee jerk reactions and clout, he’s a hack!” (I’ll admit, I agree with Jeff)

Jeff snags the remote and changes the streaming service over to find a movie for us to watch; they bickered a little bit more about it but it didn’t really get heated or anything, just felt like two friends bantering. So we start watching Return of the Living Dead and keep shooting the shit. It’s about 2:30AM and we’re chatting and joking with each other and suddenly I notice that Taylor is sitting on the couch very properly now, staring forward with that same stoic look in his face. Before I have a chance to say anything, without looking at me he gets up and walks robotically around the corner in to the kitchen. Jeff didn’t seem to notice so I turned my attention back to him and the conversation. We are interrupted shortly after with-

“Hey guys, think I’m going to head to bed.” Taylor said, very solemnly, almost like he was angry internally. He was standing nonchalantly at the bottom of the stairs, one arm raised over his head resting on the wall. Same straight faced expression on his face. We both kind of shrug and say “ok man, have a good sleep.” Without saying another word, Taylor heads upstairs. At this point I’m weirded out and feel like we angered him somehow, but i don’t know how. Again, Jeff points to him being bi-polar and tells me that some times he just has nights like these. 

So we were up for maybe another hour, the whole time we’re up and talking we can hear Taylor in his room moving around, mumbling things and maybe even moving furniture around. I never went up so I don’t know what he was doing but he slammed the door a few times as well. Eventually I’m ready to call it a night, I can’t wait to fall asleep and wake up, hop in an uber and catch my 11am flight as soon as possible now. Just to get away from this awkward scene. We say good night, and Jeff heads upstairs to his room while I make myself comfortable in my mattress on the dining room floor. 

As I’m brushing my teeth and getting into my boxers I can now hear Jeff and Taylor walking around as if going to each others rooms. It’s hard to track who is where and even their voices sound the same through the floor and because they were talking quietly. The one clear thing I did hear was:

“What are you doing?”
“Just making sure you’re okay.”

I have no idea who said what, honestly. It’s maybe a few more minutes before I hear a door slam, and go silent, no more moving around. At this point, I’m just ready to leave, I don’t want anything to do with their personal drama, I’m not that type of person. While I’m laying on my mattress, I get the unbearable feeling that I’ve got to pee.

I get back up and walk the length of the wall that runs parallel to the stairs to get to the bathroom. I finish my business and just as I’m about to leave the bathroom I hear the unmistakable sound of footsteps directly overhead, coming DOWN the stairs. 

Immediately in my head, these were my thoughts:
I’m standing in this dark house in my boxers, completely vulnerable. I need to get to my bed and look like I’m sleeping because I don’t want to talk to him now at 3:50AM, but if I don’t hurry I will literally meet him at the doorway into the living room as he comes down those stairs, whoever it is. I do have a very, very strong feeling that it’s Taylor. As silently and on my toes as possible I run to my mattress and dive under the covers, I swear I just made it and was still for when Taylors foot hit the ground floor and came around the wall. Luckily I had positioned myself so I could still keep an eye on that door frame through the slits of my eye lids. It was definitely  Taylor.

He stood at the door way, a foot away from my mattress looking down at me in the dark. After a moment of silence he said, flatly with no emotion: “Just wanted to say it was really great to see you, hope you have a good flight and hopefully see you again soon.” He then turned and slowly started going back up the stairs. 

But, after he went up 6 or maybe 7 steps, he stopped. He hasn’t moved from that spot half way up the stairs since. I’ve been typing this all out just to try and keep myself awake while I wait for dawn so I can quickly pack up and get out of here, but I can’t help this feeling that the moment I try to leave, I’m going to encounter Taylor. 

It’s now 6:30AM and I’m still completely awake, Taylor is still around the corner half way up the stairs waiting… I have no idea why, I just wish I knew who I was rooming with a little better before I did this….
