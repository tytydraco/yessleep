Before I delve into the events of that night, I should explain something about traditional rural homes in China, particularly the one where I spent my childhood. Unlike Western houses, our home was a single-storey building stretching horizontally, a common architectural style that had remained unchanged for generations in our village. The house was divided into six equal-sized rooms arranged in a row, which we called 'jian'. These rooms were grouped into three pairs - left, centre, and right - each serving distinct purposes in our daily lives.

 

The rightmost interior room, where my encounter began, held a particular significance in its location. It adjoined what we called a 'maocè', a structure that might seem peculiar to Western readers - a combination of toilet facilities and pigsty. This arrangement, though strange by modern standards, was a common feature in rural Chinese homes of that era, practical in its own way despite the obvious drawbacks. The room itself had always been used for storage, filled with various household items, old furniture, and the accumulated debris of family life.

 

I should mention that this house no longer exists - it was demolished seven years ago as part of China's rural modernisation programme. Perhaps that's what makes the events I'm about to describe even more unsettling. How can something haunt a place that no longer exists?

 

The night it happened, I found myself experiencing what I initially thought was sleep paralysis - a phenomenon I'd read about but never experienced firsthand. In this dream-like state, I felt an oppressive weight on my chest, as if something was sitting there, watching me. Through the darkness, I could make out a small, emaciated figure with matted hair hanging like seaweed around its face. Before I could properly register its features, my mind screamed a warning - 'Wraith Child' - and I jolted awake.

 

Or at least, I thought I had awakened.

 

 

I found myself in that same rightmost room, but something felt terribly wrong. The familiar cluttered space seemed somehow different, as if the shadows had taken on weight and substance. A single light bulb hung from the ceiling, its weak light barely penetrating the darkness that seemed to press in from every corner. Panic seized me as I noticed how the shadows moved - not in response to the light, but of their own accord, as if they were breathing.

 

My first instinct was to flood the space with light. I frantically fumbled for the switch, my hands trembling so violently I nearly missed it several times. When the bulb finally flickered to life, the initial burst of brightness brought a moment of relief. But that relief was short-lived. Within seconds, the light began to dim, as if some unseen force was drinking it in, leaving behind a sickly, inadequate glow that seemed to make the shadows deeper rather than dispelling them.

 

What followed was not simply a game of cat and mouse - it was psychological warfare. I found myself darting between rooms in an increasingly desperate state, my mind fracturing under the strain. The layout I had known all my life became a maze of terror. I would rush to the outer room when its light burned brightest, only to flee moments later as the darkness crept in. The four outdoor lights that had always provided security now played the same cruel trick - burning bright before fading to an eerie glow that transformed familiar surroundings into something alien and threatening.

 

Time lost all meaning. I couldn't tell if I had been running for minutes or hours. My breath came in ragged gasps, my heart pounding so hard I could hear it echoing in my ears. Sometimes I would find myself in a different room with no memory of how I got there, as if I was sleepwalking through this waking nightmare. The moonlight, filtering through windows that seemed to shift position when I wasn't looking directly at them, mixed with the failing electric lights to create an otherworldly atmosphere that made me question my own sanity.

 

 

Each time I returned to that rightmost room, reality seemed to slip further away. First, it was just a few strands of hay scattered across the floor - peculiar, as we hadn't stored hay there for years. Then stones appeared, their surfaces oddly warm to touch, as if they had just been handled. The wooden door connecting to the maocè, which I distinctly remembered closing and checking multiple times, stood wide open, revealing an impenetrable darkness that seemed to pulse with malevolent life. Most disturbingly, the window - a fixture I'd known my entire life, through which I had watched countless sunrises - simply ceased to exist, leaving behind an unbroken expanse of wall that looked as if it had always been there.

 

My mind, desperate for rationality, began manufacturing explanations. Stress, I told myself. Sleep deprivation. The human brain plays tricks when gripped by fear - I had read about this, studied it even. The strange shadows? Just my eyes adjusting to the dark. The fluctuating lights? Probably unstable rural electricity. The mysteriously appearing objects? I must have overlooked them in my panic. Each explanation felt hollow, but I clung to them like a drowning man clutches at straws.

 

Yet even as I attempted to calm myself with these rational explanations, my inner voice continued to whisper 'Wraith Child' with increasing urgency. The whisper grew louder with each passing moment, drowning out my attempts at logical thinking. It wasn't just a voice anymore - it was a certainty that settled into my bones, a truth my body recognized even as my mind tried to deny it.

 

It was around half four in the morning when salvation seemed to arrive. My mother emerged from her room in the central section, her presence bringing a momentary sense of normalcy to this nightmare. In Chinese families, particularly in rural areas, mothers possess an almost supernatural ability to sense their children's distress. Some might call it maternal instinct, but having grown up in China, I know it's something deeper, something woven into the very fabric of our culture.

 

 

She found me in the courtyard, trembling beneath the failing lights and the mocking moon. I must have been quite a sight - hair wild, clothes damp with sweat despite the cool night air, eyes darting frantically between the shadows. But there was no judgment in her expression, only that deep, unconditional concern that mothers seem to carry in their very essence.

 

"What's wrong?" she asked, her voice carrying that unique mixture of concern and strength that only mothers can muster. The familiar sound of her voice nearly broke me - it was like a lifeline thrown into the chaos my world had become.

 

I explained everything, my words tumbling out in a frenzied rush. The paralysis, the figure, the lights, the changing room - it all poured out of me like a dam breaking. I expected dismissal or disbelief; after all, how could any rational person accept such madness? Instead, she simply nodded and said, "Let's check together." That's the thing about Chinese mothers - they might not understand your fears, but they'll stand beside you to face them. In that moment, I remembered something my grandmother used to say: "In this world, everyone might betray you, but never your mother."

 

As we approached the rightmost room, something extraordinary happened. A street lamp - something that had never existed before - materialised against the central section's outer wall. It stood about a metre tall, casting a bright light that, when squinted at, bore an unsettling resemblance to a human head. The light it cast was different from the others - steady, unwavering, but somehow wrong, as if it was illuminating things that shouldn't be seen.

 

My mother saw it too - I could tell by the way her hand tightened on my arm. But neither of us spoke about it. Sometimes, acknowledging the impossible makes it more real, more threatening. Instead, we stood there in silence, watching as the impossible light cast impossible shadows across the courtyard walls.

 

 

I felt momentarily reassured by my mother's presence, convincing myself that my earlier fears were merely products of an overactive imagination. The human mind, after all, is remarkably good at finding patterns in chaos, at creating monsters from shadows. With another person beside me - especially my mother - surely the terror would prove to be nothing more than an elaborate trick of my stressed mind. How foolish that conviction would prove to be.

 

Together, we entered that rightmost room, my mother's presence temporarily bolstering my courage. The light bulb, for once, maintained a steady glow, as if even the darkness respected my mother's authority. For a brief moment, I felt almost embarrassed about my earlier panic. The room looked normal - cluttered, yes, but familiar. Safe. That's when everything changed.

 

In the corner where my old bed stood, a child materialised. Not gradually, mind you, but instantly - as if it had always been there and we'd simply failed to notice. The figure appeared to be around four or five years old, but something was terribly wrong about its proportions. I couldn't focus on its features; they seemed to shift and blur like a photograph taken with a shaking hand. It was as if reality itself rejected its presence, yet there it stood, defying all natural laws.

 

My mother, who had been the epitome of calm until that moment, grabbed my arm with such force that her nails dug into my skin. We backed away slowly at first, then turned and fled. But our escape wasn't complete - it was never going to be that simple.

 

As we reached the relative safety of the courtyard, I felt an unexpected weight in my arms. Looking down, I discovered I was cradling what appeared to be an infant. Its presence defied logic - I hadn't picked anything up, hadn't even touched anything in our hasty retreat. Yet there it was, as real and solid as my own trembling hands. The weight felt wrong, not like a normal baby - too heavy in some places, too light in others, as if its mass shifted and changed like liquid mercury.

 

Panic overtook us both. We tried to place the infant on the ground, but our hands wouldn't release it. We attempted to drop it in the fields before our house - but it remained, impossibly, in my arms. It was as if the infant had become a part of me, a horrifying extension of my own body. The more we tried to rid ourselves of it, the more it seemed to meld with my flesh.

 

That's when I finally, truly woke up.

 

In the clear light of morning, I found myself in my modern apartment, thousands of miles from that old family home which was demolished seven years ago. But something feels different now. Sometimes, in the corner of my eye, I catch glimpses of a small figure. And at night, when the lights begin to dim, I feel a weight in my arms - not quite there, but not entirely absent either.

 

I called my mother this morning. Without prompting, she asked, "Did you have that dream too?" Her voice carried the same tremor I remembered from that night. We didn't discuss the details - some terrors are better left unspoken. But I know she remembers. I know she feels it too.

 

I'm writing this now because I need to know - has anyone else encountered a Wraith Child? And more importantly, once it finds you in your dreams, does it ever truly let go? Because even now, as I type these words, I can feel something small and cold pressing against my chest, and the lights in my room are beginning to dim...
