I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Sean. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.


I still lived in New Brunswick. I still lived with my parents. It was 2017.

One night I came out of my room at night when everyone else was asleep.

The TV was on and a weird movie was playing. It was about children going into Santa's workshop and there were trolls instead of elves. They were eating the childrens family and they started screaming.

I checked the guide and it said troll.

I was weirded out. I had seen this movie before and this was not in it.

I turned around to see two ethereal women standing there looking at me. They looked like cartoons just appearing in front of the sofa. One was a math smoking hippie girl and one was Plutia from Hyper dimension neptunia.

"I'm Santa Muarte and I put a curse on you when jerked off too the first scene in troll 2. That's why you're seeing the real troll right now. I want you to go watch Troll 2 again and jerk off to that other scene with a pretty girl in it so you can see the real troll 3." The hippie girl growled. "Or else I'll eat you!"

Plutia chimed in "Don't do that or she'll get you! Instead you should go back to Kyle's and get Soul Caliber 3 and your memory card. You can't just leave those there!"

I remembered how obviously cursed theose neptunia games had been once I knew what too look for and wondered if I should trust either of the angels. 

The first two neptunia games had been jokes and the third one was a trap. Once you got too the impossible joke ending after a barrage of impossible side quests you came too and impossible boss. After you got owned by the impossible boss the enemies in the first 2 games then all became impossible.

Plutia interrupted me "You but I sparred you! You didn't finish the second game, and you are just assuming they are invincible in neptunia 1! You haven't tried it out yet. And I mean if ever want t suicide ill make special for you if you go back and finish the spell..."

Santa muarte barked "Go to the meth cave so that you may see my children in action, and so that you may retrieve your stuff, and so that you may know who you are!"

Plutia responded "Go there because I say to do it, not because she said to do it."

I decided to listen to Plutia and not to my gut and drove to Kyle's. There was snow on the ground that had not been ploughed and it was kind of a lot for my car.

I got there and went inside, getting my memory card and final game. Robbie and Kyle were dissapointed.

I put my stuff in the car and tried to drive home, but I was stuck.

"I have you now" I heard Santa Muarte's voice.

I went back inside and Kyle and Robbie were elated.

"I won't deny you a place too sleep." Kyle said with a freakish grin.

We talked for a bit and then Kyle went too his room to sleep.

"This  is the darkest of all timelines" Ricki said as he fell asleep on the couch.

I looked at the floor with my blanket and pillow and heard Plutia 

"They will murder you first thing in the morning if you stay here. Your car is stuck but it's not far, you can walk home." Plutia said.

I looked at the sleeping Robbie and then went outside. It seemed calm and there was not that much snow. I left my car and began the journey home.

At the half way point a truck drove by me and I got a creepy feeling. I started climbing the hill and then it went from calm too 80mph winds in a couple of seconds.

The wind howled and I stood there for a second, dazed. Then a golden light shone on me from above.

"LOOK UP" I heard Lara Croft scream.

I immediately realized I had found all the collectibles in the awful tomb raider game and was now suffering the consequences.

I started walking again and Lara Croft kept screaming "Look up, look up!"

The lights shifted from gold, to purple and then to red.

I made it home, and when I went inside I went to look out the window too check and see if my footprints were still there.

While I was seeing no footprints I saw Santa Muarte standing behind me in my reflection. She was folding in on herself in a 4D kind of way. Her raggedy hair and intense hangings being profoundly scaring since they were appearing at so many points in time simultaneously.

I turned on the light and turned around and saw nothing. I checked the clock and realized that the ides of march were over. Maybe  symbol of something?

The next day I met the prettiest woman who had ever been interested in me. She seemed to really like me and we hit it off really well.

I told a bunch of people what I had seen and my parents signed me up for psychiatric help.

"You're in a doctor's care now" My mother said.

I sat there waiting for my meeting with the early psychosis program and after my meeting I heard the voice of Yahweh in my head.

"That crown can give you level 8 powers, but only when I say you need them." Yahweh said with authority. "Now is one of those times, please phase through the wall. There is something you must see."

I walked into the wall and too my amazement I went right through it and was in a different corner of the mental hospital. 

Yahweh told me to hide behind a desk and I did as I was told. It wasn't long before I heard a commotion coming our way.

"You don't care about my health!" a young man screamed in terror.

He then ran by me followed by 5 men in red jumpsuits. They had syringes. When they caught the dude they stuck him with one and he fell over paralyzed.

"Doctor injoku likes live food." one of the red suited men said.

They carried the man by me and he screamed.

I waited for a second and then followed them on Yahweh's orders.

They went to a room and from the hallway I could see the totally back dragon toothed man and Wilbur Eheatly waiting.

Before I was seen I ran out of sight and was out of that hospital before Yahweh turned off my phase power. 

"Go back and make your appointments as long as you are in the early psychosis program." Yahweh stated. "But once they put you over to the fact team you are on the menu."

I drove home and life continued. That pretty woman and me continued and it was something that is kind of hard to talk about. But one night after we 'made love' I appeared suddenly in another room. Satan stood there looking at me.

"Hey Sean." Satan said. "Guess what, I'm here too show you your future, and you are not going to like it."

"Asses too you!" I said "You're evil why would I listen to you?"

"Because I can't show you a false future, that's against the rules. Why don't you just look and see what happens." Satan said intelligently. "I'm no more evil than Samiaza and I too seek redemption through you. Clara, the woman you are in love with and the woman who is currently in love with you was once deemed as evil as me and these other 9th layer of heller's, but now she has taken her chance at redemption and used it to plot your demise from heaven, and that is what I must show you."

He lead me to a television screen held up by what looked like nerves.

"First she will cast a nasty spell on your dingus to try and make you need her." Stan said while showing me the video. "Then when you are love making she will yank your soul out of your body and fill it with love" He said while showing me the video.

I watched in disbelief. I had never been more scared in my life.

Satan clicked his remote and went to the next scene. "Then she's going to let your soul that's full of love go and your mother will intercept it. Smashing it took bits and taking all the love. Clara would like you to believe this is an accident. But I assure you, she programmed her soul from heaven to comply with Saren's plot and your mother is taking orders from the same person. Nothing you can do to stop it either, it happens." Satan went through more scenes and went years into the future.

"And at the end of this when your going to do what I tell you to do now and get her out of your life and never speak to her again, she's going to hunt you down and murder you. It's programmed into her soul and nothing is going to stop her. So I would advise you get rid of her as fast as fucking possible.

Satan showed me some alternate timelines as well, going over the best and worse case scenarios based on how well I could have taken this or not and then I was back in my room. Sitting there looking at Clara.


I am a monk who lives at a monastery in rural tennessee. I wrote the preceding story when  Satan told me that if I did not, that I would be sent to the lake of fire. I have written this here so please God have mercy on my soul!
