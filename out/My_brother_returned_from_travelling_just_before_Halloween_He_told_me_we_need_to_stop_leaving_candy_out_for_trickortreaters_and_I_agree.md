Call me bitter, but I don’t leave candy out on Halloween. Kids nowadays are chubby enough, aren’t they? Why should I encourage that? I think what I’m trying to say is, I’ve never been a traditionalist. Not by a long shot.

Well, I held this conviction up until my brother Isaac came back. A year ago he’d gone travelling with a fresh degree in maths and all the cheer in the world. The man who returned, though, couldn’t be more different. Trick-or-treaters dared venture out the day before Halloween; things were changing.

It was the morning of the 30th when I heard that knock at the door. I almost didn’t recognise him with how haggard he looked. When I did, I promptly invited him inside.

I guided him to the living room, and we sat together on the couch. Isaac stared into the fireplace, seeming vacant.

“Soo… how’s that soul-searching been going?” I said with a nervous chuckle.

Isaac didn’t reply for a moment, taking a deep breath before,

“Well, I- um, I found *something*,” he croaked, “I just don’t like what I found.”

This caught my attention. I asked him what he meant by that, and he said,

“How do I put it… something unlocked in my head.”

To me, a relatively sane individual, this initially translated to ‘I’ve gone stir crazy’. But the days of seeing in black and white are long past, so I played along.

Isaac must’ve seen the expression on my face, because his eyes widened and he held a hand up in defence.

“No, not like that, Joel. It’s not just me. It’s you, too. It’s everyone, it’s-”

He stopped mid-sentence and spun around to the window. Through it, my front lawn; empty and verdant.

“You don’t see them, do you?”

The question caught me off guard,

“See who?”

His eyes told of worry. Not the kind you’d feel being late for work, or from losing your wallet. It was heavier than that.

“‘Course you don’t. No one does.”

At this point, my brother was essentially telling me he was hallucinating. I stood up and glanced at Isaac.

“Look, man, you sit here and relax. Do you want some tea? Coffee?”

“Only Irish.”

I sighed, moving toward the kitchen.

“I’ll call mom, tell her to come visit. She hasn’t seen you in, what, best part of a year?”

“Okay.”

I rang my mother and filled her in. She said her schedule was open and she could be here tonight. We exchanged pleasantries, then she hung up. Good, that gave Isaac and me a little longer to catch up.

“Joel?”

Isaac had the same impatience in his voice. I attempted to hide my exasperation as I strode back over and flopped down next to him.

“Uh, who I see, you asked. The dead. I see the dead.”

Furrowing my brow, I lifted my gaze to meet his.

“Isaac… we need to get you help, man. What happened to you out there?”

“No, just listen. Humour me,” he growled, “a few minutes. That’s all it’ll take.”

I acquiesced, leaning back on the couch.

“Alright, I need you to follow my instructions. Is that okay?”

“Sure.”

“Good. Now, shut your eyes.”

I did.

“Deep breath, in the nose, out the mouth.”

After three or four minutes of this, Isaac spoke up again, softly this time,

“Okay, now… *the one who dissolves all*.”

Something sparked in my brain, and I replied,

“The one who comes after.”

Then, in perfect unison, we both said,

“Yparchr.”

And the instant we did, a searing pain tore through my skull and my ears rang. It felt like the Sun’s energy, condensed and poured into my ears - then, as quick as it had come, it dissipated.

I slowly opened my eyes and directed a look toward Isaac. He appeared no worse for wear.

“W-what- what the fuck was that!?”

“Easy,” Isaac said, “it hurts, I know. You can’t say its name too much- or, well, you shouldn’t.”

I continued to stare expectantly.

“Okay, so, this is hard for me to convey, just try to understand. There are known knowns, right? Things we’re sure of.”

I nodded, still silent.

“Then, there’s known unknowns. The things we’re not sure of yet. And then, we have unknown unknowns. Those vague concepts and meanings, drifting in the aether, beyond awareness…”

Isaac trailed off, staring at some distant point.

“Rumsfeld, huh?”
 
Isaac shot me a confused grimace.

“Uh, yeah. Anyway, that’s all common knowledge. Problem is, the sequence isn’t complete. One’s missing… unknown knowns.”

It took a beat for me to register what he said.

“Unknown- how would that even work?”

He hummed in contemplation, then said,

“My guess is instinct. Kind of like fears - the rational ones. When you see something long and slick, and the animal brain in you screams, ‘SNAKE!’. Only, it’s not like that. It’s not a physical instinct. Those don’t involve *words*.”

“So, those words, ‘the one who-’”

“NO!” Isaac yelped, shooting out a hand, “don’t. Don’t say it.”

“Isaac. Tell me what’s going on. What do they mean?”

His shoulders dropped. He seemed dejected.

“I can’t tell you, and you shouldn’t try finding out. Whatever it means, it’s something old, and buried. A reminder of something awful, so awful that we can’t even *remember* it. That’s how it should stay, except…”

“Except what?”

“Except, Halloween.”

Well, at least his sudden arrival made sense. I yawned and leaned forward.

“Look, Isaac-”

A buzz of my phone interrupted me, and I picked it up off the couch.

‘*Stopping by to see a friend on the way, see you 5-6 x*’

“Mom’s gonna be here later tonight. We have time. So, Halloween? It’s a pretty convenient subject matter.”

Isaac shuffled in his seat, his countenance turning saturnine.

“Yep, fu-ckin’ Halloween. So, bear with me here, and try to take this as seriously as I am.”

“Okay.”

“Now there’s a few theories on its origins; pagan roots aside, most agree it was the Catholics. A time to pray for those souls stuck in between. I mean, they weren’t the first. Greeks and Romans had it. It’s the concept that matters. The whole ‘appeasing the dead’ thing. Hell, all the way back to ancient Egypt. They were crazy about that shit. Sometimes I wonder if I’d wanna be buried in canopic jars, you know, all disembowelled and-”

“Isaac.”

“Right, sorry. Anyway, I’m gonna make a leap here straight to trick-or-treating. That started way back, like, medieval times, but it all shares the same idea of appeasing the dead. Receiving gifts - treats - on their behalf. That’s what it’s all about, and it’s lived on to this day.”

I’d been nodding along, despite not having even the foggiest of understandings.

“So what? I knew that anyway. How is this relevant to some instinctual phrase?”

“Ah, you see… Halloween isn’t to *appease* the dead. They told me.”

Isaac gestured toward the window with a flick of his head.

“No. It’s to *replenish*, strengthen them.”

“Why? What do they need strength for?”

“To resist passing on. To resist *it*.”

“Resist what!?”

I found myself getting upset without being sure why. Isaac leaned in, and whispered,

“The one who comes after.”

A chill ran through me, but so did a burning pain explode in my head. In that brief period of agony, something moved outside the window. I thought it was mist, but mist isn’t so… solid.

“Why you?” I asked. Isaac snorted.

“Ab-so-lutely no idea.. I started getting migraines over in India. Wasn’t too bad until Nepal - that’s when I came back. Just couldn’t take it anymore. Those words, Joel, they scrape inside my skull, day in, day out. It never stops. The headaches can get bad, but they don’t even come close to *knowing*.”

“You must’ve done something!”

“I told you, I have no idea. Well, I do, actually - it doesn’t explain why *me*, but I was gonna get to it anyway.”

I glanced at the clock. 4pm. Did five hours just pass? How? I couldn’t find the energy to care, though. All my focus was on Isaac.

“Like I said, whatever this whole asking-receiving thing gives off on Halloween, they feed on it. That might seem a good thing, and it is - *once a year*. That’s enough to keep them from slipping. But now, oh, now it’s getting out of hand. Last year, the kids went out on the 30th too. Same for the year before. And the result? We’re sentencing ourselves.”

He paused to look out the window again, shook his head at something, then turned back to me.

“We’re overfeeding them, Joel. They’re still here, still everywhere. You know what happens when you overfeed something?”

“They get fat.”

“Well, yes, but they also get complacent and indiscreet. All that strength we’re giving them… a little is enough. But this? All we’re doing is- well, we’re lighting a beacon. Nothing’s gonna miss the flame of billions of happy souls. And I have this terrible feeling that I know who’s gonna see it, or- no, it *has* seen it. It’s already started, Joel. It’s come to collect, and bring us to where we’re meant to go. Where we go after.”

“And then?”

Isaac glared at me in disbelief.

“There is no ‘then’. It’s final. I know you can’t see them, but right now, as we speak, I see. I see it picking them off, one by one. It’s taking them all and- and- and when we go, it’s going to take us too-”

He broke down then. I was shocked he’d been keeping it together at all. I shouldn’t’ve believed a word he said, and yet, that yowling instinct inside me most certainly did.

Stealing another glance at the clock, I saw it was almost five.

“Ah, crap. One minute, dude.”

I stood on numb legs and wobbled my way to the kitchen counter, grabbed the bowl of candy I’d prepared then shuffled back to the front door. Isaac must’ve heard the latch click, because he shot to his feet.

“Are you fucking stupid!? What are you doing? Weren’t you listening to ANYTHING!?!”

I did hesitate. The unknown-known thing I had real, empirical evidence for. The rest? Conjecture. In retrospect, I just wanted to deny it. To ignore the hideous truth and get on with my life.

I pulled the door open. At the same time, Isaac vaulted over the couch and barrelled straight for me, shoving me down and knocking the bowl of candy all over the floor.

I stared up at Isaac in shock then attempted to stand, but he rushed over and crouched beside me, gripping my arm.

“Joel, please listen. Even if it’s not for me, don’t do it. You’ve *never* done it before, so please, don’t. The kids won’t be missing out. I mean, you’ve got candy corns in there for chrissakes.”

I really didn’t have a response.

“Please?”

“God- yeah, okay! Fine. You better pull yourself together, though, mom’ll be here any minute now.”

Isaac nodded solemnly.

“Oh, and sweep those candies up. Your fault they’re all over the floor. Broom’s in the pantry over there.”

He looked down, curling his lip, and went to grab the broom.

“I’m being honest, Joel. I can’t live with this alone. But you don’t believe me.”

Getting annoyed now, I paced up to him.

“I don’t know, Isaac. Maybe. I’d rather think you just need help.”

Flat despair flushed his face, but he went right on with cleaning up. I turned to the living room, and called out,

“Also, please go have a shave. And a shower, for that matter. You look like you’ve been living with wolves.”
 
We had the place ship-shape in about twenty minutes. Isaac was still in the shower when mom arrived, heralded by a soft rapping at my door. I opened it to see her face, creased with a warm smile.

“Happy Halloween! Well, for tomorrow, but it may as well be, right?”

“Right,” I said uneasily, “come on in, mom. You must be exhausted, two-fifty miles since this morning.”

“Thanks, sweetheart. I- oh, where’s Isaac? Is he okay?”

“Uh, yeah. He’s fine, just taking a shower. Come, it’s cold out.”

I closed the door behind her and led her to the dinner table, where I realised I hadn’t changed out of these clothes all day, damp with the stress-sweat of my chat with Isaac.

“Hey, I’m just gonna go get a fresh set on. Sit tight, Isaac’ll probably be down before me.”

She smiled, and slung off her handbag. Meanwhile, I took the stairs two steps at a time to see Isaac was already dry and dressed. I told him mom was in the downstairs and to behave. He gave me a brief “mm.” somewhere between agreement and denial, but I decided to trust him.

Light raindrops pattered on my window as I threw my dirty clothes on the laundry chair and searched for something more respectful. Something gave me pause then. Another noise, beneath the rainfall - mom and Isaac chatting. I must’ve really been on edge. I buttoned up my jeans, then fell right back into unease. What were they talking about?

I rushed out to the top of the stairs, in time to hear,

“The one who dissolves all.”

This idiot. Why couldn’t he listen? I nearly slipped as I flew down the stairs, and at the landing my mother said,

“The one who comes after.”

Mouth dry, temples burning, I skipped down the last few steps. The table came into view, where Isaac sat uncomfortably close to mom. I called out,

“Isa-”

But was cut off as they both said its name in identical rhythm and tone. That horrible, grating name. I marched purposefully into the dining room and grabbed Isaac by the shoulders.

“Isaac! Stop it, now! Do NOT say it again.”

Before he could reply, mom took the liberty of doing so,

“What? The one who comes after?”

That time, the pain was tenfold. It was so intense my knees gave out and I collapsed to the floor, whilst Isaac arched in his chair. What chilled me the most, though, was how my mother seemed utterly unaffected by saying it.

“I’m sorry, who is the one who comes after? Yparchr?”

“Stop!” I yelled, now in a fetal position. But she kept going, more and more fervently. She seemed to convulse in the chair and her voice took on a horrific hollow timbre that sounded like a shuddering barrel of screws.

“Who is… who… the one who dissolves all. The one who comes after. The one who comes after. Yparchr, *Yparchr, YPARCHR!*”

I could do nothing except cry. It felt like she dug her very own grave right in front of me, while I was forced to watch.

And, oh, that couldn’t have been more true. Because when I squinted in agony once more, the world shifted. I blinked, and before me laid an entirely different scene.

My front yard was empty no more. There were figures, shimmering like reflections. So many. I saw no end to them. They blended in and around each other, but amongst the chaos, one detail stood out. Each and every one of them wore smiles on their faces - not of malice, but contentment.

This made even less sense, because behind them, arcing up and out from the masses, were towering, serpentine pillars. They burned a blinding white and I could see they were entirely made of a pure flame. The dead seemed none the wiser. Only when they were snatched up into those fingers- or claws- or talons, would panic bloom on their faces.

And then, the most gut-wrenching sight of them all.

A smaller limb had already reached through the kitchen window as if nothing was there at all, and had its coiled, branching fingers gripped around my mother’s head. I saw them slither into her eyes, nose, mouth, while her whole body glowed with magnesic energy. I saw her silvery hair burst into flames, her skin and flesh bubble and slough off the bone, carbonising before even hitting the floor.

And then she was still. I couldn’t look away. The limb pulled and pulled, heaving a translucent mass from mom’s body, which came free with one final tug. Whatever it tore out screamed as it retracted with whiplike speed. A stray coil lashed out from the limb and brushed my face. For a brief moment, I saw a glimpse of what comes after. A burning, seething place where all minds and memories are melted into one roiling consciousness, stuck in eternal delirium. It must've lasted for a second, but it was enough for me to wail in terror and squeeze my eyelids shut.

When I opened them, it was all gone. Isaac’s chair was empty. He sat on the floor beside me, shivering. When I looked back to the table, I screamed. I screamed until my throat gave out.

A blackened husk was all that remained of my mom, hunched and crumbling onto the table. Warmth spread down my leg, but I didn’t care. My sole focus was coming to terms with what just happened.

I want to feel angry, to beat Isaac within an inch of his life, but I don’t have the strength. It’s funny, I don’t even feel sad. Just… shock. Cold, all-encompassing shock.

I don’t know how I’m going to explain this to the cops. I could frame it as Isaac going on a psychotic rampage, but I believe him now. What I saw out there was exactly as he’d said. That thing I cannot name, dragging them away to a place we were always destined for. We’re sending ourselves there. *Us*. Not some ethereal hand of judgement. And it’s all because of this stupid tradition, taken too far - as always.

I’m not gonna be celebrating Halloween. Ever. And I’ll work with all my wretched soul to stop as many as I can from doing so.
