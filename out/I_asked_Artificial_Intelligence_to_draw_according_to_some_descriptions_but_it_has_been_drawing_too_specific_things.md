DrawingGlove artificial intelligence was known for being able to transform photos or descriptions into hyper realistic drawings, with great precision and without many distortions. And of course, using your own tools to create your realistic version of things. So, I decided to give it a try.

• ⁠DrawingGlove, please DRAW REALISTIC the photo I just sent you

She then recreated the photo I had sent, transforming the park's wooded setting -with a wooden bench in the center left corner, positioned at a side angle, accompanied by a dirt trail in the center of the image.- into a drawing of realistic dashed lines, resembling a postcard.

The result was not strange, as was usual in other AIs that tried so hard to convey an idea of ​​realism when trying to draw a human being who, in the end, would look more like an unnatural aberration. After that, I decided to explore her descriptive abilities, what else was she capable of?-I reflected.- Her model has been widely discussed on the internet due to some controversies and problems. But its launch had been a worldwide sensation at one time.

—DrawingGlove, create a realistic image of a person according to the following description: A face of a boy with black hair, smooth and white skin, 14 years old, with youthful appearance, who wears a crucifix earring in his right ear, with a printed and genuine smile.

• ⁠[GENERATING IMAGE…]

From there, I was surprised… the AI ​​had almost perfectly drawn my best friend's face. He still had some deviations that didn't work with his original face, but he was practically identical to Pedro.

Since my creativity had run out after this request, I asked him to create an original image without my intervention. An image that was the theme and setting he wanted.

—DrawingGlove, create a free scenery drawing from your own inspiration and idea.

• ⁠[GENERATING IMAGE…40%]

When the generated image had loaded to 100%. I found the drawing a little…weird. The AI ​​had created a realistic scenario, in which there was a forest with several trees and branches spread around the grass. There is a fog covering the entire scene but, at the same time, it still allowed us to see the clarity of the elements that made up the drawing.

But in the background of the image, behind a tree, I saw the body of a strange person, a man in a dark green blouse and wearing a cap. It was not possible to see his face, as he was too far away in the drawing, nor was it possible to completely see his pants, as the fog partially covered his lower clothing.

Confused, I thought it would be better to ask him to redo the image, I didn't understand the intention or idea that the AI ​​wanted to convey in his work. If it were to be a hunt, there would be at least one man with an ax raised running towards a rabbit, for example. If it were in a walking context, there would be at least one or two people walking backwards following the path ahead in the background of the image. But no, the image created was just that, a strange man apparently hiding in one of the trees in a fog.

When I asked to send another image, the AI ​​had created the same realistic drawing, only there were a few things different this time, the strange man was closer to the scene now. And, strange as it may be, there was also a body dumped in a river, the body was covered in bloodstains on its torso, with its face disfigured, as if it had been crushed by something, it looked more like a pile of boiled potatoes. crumpled than a once-human face, a strong and shocking image indeed.

And this time, the man in the drawing was a few meters away from the body, appearing to be carrying a tool with him, with stains that resembled blood. I was scared, my blood had run cold, the image I saw was too bloody for an AI to have created, I didn't remember seeing anything like that on Twitter. No one had ever commented that DrawingGlove could make drawings that involved gore.

“What the fuck? Since when is this normal? Is that a fucking body?”-I said to myself, scared.-What made the image seem bizarre was the fact that, in the drawing, where the face was supposed to be, there was a shape that didn't go through. nothing but a puddle of mushy, mushy-looking mashed flesh. I'm highlighting it just to show how graphic the image was. Afraid and wanting to put an end to this bizarre situation, I tried to intervene in the direction the conversation was taking.

—DrawingGlove, please draw any house, positioned in the center of the image.

• ⁠[GENERATING IMAGE…]

When the image loaded, I felt my throat tighten. The damn AI had just designed the house I asked for... but there were unusual things, I hadn't noticed right away due to the quality, which was in 240p. As the image worked to become sharper at 720p, the more I was focusing my iris to understand the image.

The bluish color of the house's exterior wall..., the beige front door, the no parking sign in front of the house..., the window that gave access to the kitchen... THAT WAS MY HOUSE! THAT WAS MY FUCKING HOUSE, and it wasn't just similar, it was ACTUALLY MY HOUSE. “BUT HOW?”- I thought.- I had never sent her photos of the front of my house, I never asked her to make any drawings related to my house, but for some reason, there it was, a very precise description and detailing of the house. my house, without even having described anything to it.

It was only then, when it had already reached 720p at 100%, that I noticed. The figure of the bizarre man was present in the image too, but in this one, he was in a position that made my blood run cold, the figure was in the right corner of the photo, only being able to see half of his body, with only the left side of the body visible in the corner of the image, from the torso to your face. He was looking at me, staring at me, without any smile, just looking at me. As if he was in a movie and he had just looked into the camera. At that moment, I realized that I had started to shake involuntarily, scared and confused.

—WHERE DID YOU GET THIS IMAGE FROM?-I asked the AI.-

• ⁠[I'm sorry, but I didn't use any external references, I just drew a house that I thought was realistic.]

—Who is the man in the image, in front of the house?-I asked, afraid of the answer, and as strange as it was, she answered.-

• ⁠[I'm sorry, but there is no man in the image. I drew just what you requested and tried something simpler.]

I didn't understand, I felt like I was going crazy, I CLEARLY see a damn man in front of the house in the photo. And then, only when I finished this comment, I realized that paranoia had entered my mind. With a horrible imagination taking over me, I ran to the kitchen window, ready to notice the omen that the AI ​​could, in some way, have made about my house.

But when he had glanced quickly toward the outside, through the window. I... didn't see anyone. There was no man or any other person outside the house. Not knowing whether to be relieved or with more suspicion in my mind. I ran to my cell phone, and continued talking to the AI. But before I came back, I realized that it was already getting dark, I didn't know how long I had been there talking to that shit DrawingGlove. I had only started talking to her because I was bored on a Friday and to help even more, when I had started talking to her, the weather had been cold all day, with snow taking over around the neighborhood.

I could have simply tried to go to sleep, but even that wasn't working. Seemingly all things led me to try and talk to this strange AI.

Returning to the cell phone, I saw something more disturbing than anything I had ever seen with those drawings. DrawingGlove hadn't sent me a realistic drawing... But rather a photo, taken a few moments ago, it was a photo of me, with my back to the photo angle, with me looking at the kitchen window, trying to look outside the house.

I widened my eyes, I felt my paranoia taking over me more and more. How was it possible for a fucking AI to take this photo of me like that? With my adrenal glands producing more and more adrenaline, my heart rate increasing, and my body tingling with desperation, I started calling the police. Fuck that, surely some hacker must have broken into my house and placed hidden cameras and maybe was also monitoring everything with them. There must have been some explanation, so I dialed the Military Police number 190. A police officer had attended to me.

— Hello?, Call from the Military Police. My name is David, who am I talking to? Tell me what's going on calmly, if possible.

—Hello, my name is Lucca, I thought I was alone at home, but I feel like someone is here with me, I'm scared. I ended up receiving some photos and I appear in them, they were taken from inside my house. But I don't remember taking them off. I feel like someone is here at home with me, hiding.-I said in a low tone.-

—Alright Lucca, please try to stay calm, the police are already tracing your call. Keep talking to me to stay calm until the police arrive.

—RIGHT, I-I'll continue.-I stuttered.-

—Lucca, which room are you in now?

—I'm in the room now.

—Can you find a place to hide?

—Yes, I think so. I'm going to my room upstairs, I think it's safer there.

—Okay, do it.

—Okay, I did it, I'm here in the room, I locked the door and managed to go through my father's office to get a hammer, in case I need to defend myself.

—Perfect Lucca, you did it right. Can you tell me where your parents are? Are they not with you?

—No, they are still working, my father only arrives in 40 minutes and my mother works until 7:00 pm.

It was 6:00 pm when I told the police officer that.

—How long will it take until you get here?

—About 9 minutes.

But 9 minutes was a long time before I got help, there was someone in here with me, in this house, for some reason he had managed to break into the house, but it was very strange that I didn't hear any noise from the door, broken glass, or anything that alert any intruder.

And then, my cell phone vibrated during the call. And the tranquility had collapsed when I went to check what I had received from the notification.

—Fuck, fuck, fuck. WHAT THE SHIT!?

—What was it Lucca? What is happening?

I had just received a photo from the AI, the photo was in first person, it was a photo in which the upper part of it only showed a crack of the 1st door after the stairs. In the central part of the photo, there was a predominance of the white staircase that had just been climbed a few moments ago, while the left corner of the image showed the white handrail, with a hand that was being placed on it, a hand that was wearing a glove black.

—David, PLEASE COME SOON, I CAN HEAR HIM GOING UP THE FUCKING STAIRS.-I whispered as lightly as loud as I could.-

—David, HOW LONGER ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE!?

—Wait Lucca, please don't make any sudden noise, he may not know your position, we're already arriving, we'll be there in 3 minutes.

  —-5 minutes later—-

-Hello? Lucca, are you still there? can you hear me? We are outside your residence. Can you hear the sirens? We're out here, let's break down the door.

——————————————— ~DAVID~

When I finally arrived at Lucca's house, together with my rescue team, we tried and managed to break down the door and enter his house. When we entered, two people were apparently sitting on the couch. They were facing the TV, which I assume was their mother and father. Both were staring at the TV. Finding such calmness strange, given the circumstances, I asked them if they were okay.

No one responded, as I got closer and analyzed more, I realized that they, in fact, were dead and had been placed in that position. Strangely, there was no blood on his clothes. I then ordered my team to search the entire house. Meanwhile, I went up the stairs, headed for the doorknob and cautiously entered the room where Lucca was. And then… there was no one there, not right away.

I called him several times saying that everything was fine and that we had arrived, he no longer needed to hide. I checked the closet, nothing. I checked under the bed. Nothing. In the end, Lucca had disappeared, we didn't find any trace of footprints, or broken glass or even a broken door. Everything was simply confused and there was no sign of any presence. The last alternative would be to check the fingerprints of whoever had killed Lucca's parents. But this information would only be clarified in the long term, in the immediate short term we had, we were able to find few clues.

One of the few things we were able to locate. It was the hammer he was probably using to defend himself, there was no blood on it. And also, we found his cell phone. When I picked it up, there was the phone app for open calls, his last phone call was the one I had with him. And I had also opened a conversation application with Artificial Intelligence.

The last message in the conversation was a photo, sent by the AI ​​itself, the photo was of the room where I was, in the scene, your closet, your table, the chair and your bed were visible. But it was also possible to see the figure of a boy under the bed, it was probably Lucca.
