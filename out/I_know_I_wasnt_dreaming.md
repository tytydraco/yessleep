I share a room with my brother Jordan. I would be lying to say our room wasn’t as my mother would put it “A pig stye”. Clothes sprawl across the floor, shirts rolled and kicked away from the crude walkway we had constructed leading to our beds. Jeans crumble in heaps peeking from under our beds as they've been pushed aside as we go to bed.

We are both tall, and the room was never built to be a room for 2 people. The door to our room opens only 3 quarters of the way on the account of my bed being in the way, to the left is my brother's desk and draws, and just above that is his bed. My bed was behind the door and my desk opposite. The room was divided into “our halves.” Which always causes arguments. We live in the attic room, the ceiling slanted on either side giving more space to the middle where both sides meet.

I have tried cleaning up but when you live with another slob you both riff off each other's nasty habits, the mentality of “why the hell should I clean when they don't.” lives in both your heads. We had made an effort to clean, now all the clothes accumulated in one large mass below Jordans bed, rubbish was left in bin bags outside our door for the next day.

I have always gone to bed earlier while Jordan stays up late playing Overwatch shouting and screaming at how useless his team mates are. I always sleep with earphones in, somehow listening to music, usually heavy metal or some techno. 

It's been a few days since but I can remember it all. As quickly as I had fallen asleep I had woken up. The tinny beat of my music breaks the silence of the dark room, my earbuds are lost somewhere in my bedding, the room is dark and my eyes adjust. I can see Jordan sleeping.

Suddenly I start levitating, floating off my bed slowly. The once quiet room now filled with the worst most excruciating piercing “beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep” high pitched, it shook through my ear and down my jaw. I hit off the ceiling and scrambled to the middle, dreaming I must be dreaming that's all I could think. How the fuck do I wake myself up.

While this is happening I'm looking down at my room, and it was my room not one detail different, from the clothes piled up, the scruffy stained carpet, the blinking light of my sleeping pc. I have never had a dream where my room has been so accurate.

I tried screaming, I tried to call for help but nothing came out, I could feel the lump of despair jamming my throat as all I could hear was pathetic squeaks escaping my mouth. I thought if I tried screaming loud enough maybe just maybe Jordan would wake up and come jostle me awake. Maybe I could reach him in the land of reality.

The floating stopped and I fell hard, landing on the pile of clothes below Jordans bed. I don’t know if I couldn't move out of pure fear or something else. I tried screaming harder, I could feel my face turning purple and my head getting dizzier with every weak attempt.


I managed to drag myself back to bed, clawing at the floor dragging my body behind. The piercing beep cuts out suddenly as I pull myself up onto my bed. I frantically looked around my room for a sign of anything. I don’t know what I wanted, I definitely didn't want him to come out. Out of the dark corner of the room, A large tall figure steps below my bed.

He was in darkness, I don't know how else to explain him, there was a face, or the moulding of a face once there. I felt him watching, I felt the non existent eyes crawling over me. Jordan stirred behind him and with his head still focused on me, I could feel his observation shift to him. 

Like a child scared of monsters in his closet I ducked under my duvet, I felt his hands gripping and tearing at the sheets

I lay there crying, my legs on fire as a constant barrage of his fingernails slowly, methodically scratched down my calfs.

Eventually, I stopped, I stayed like that until the light started coming in. Exhausted I peaked out. He was gone. I couldn't get myself to peak out any further. My legs felt grimy from his cold grip, I was shaking, it felt like the worst cramp of my entire life.

I must have eventually fallen asleep, I have thought about this for days. It couldn't have been a dream, I have never fallen asleep in a dream, let alone remembering every hour that passed in it.

I've also never been left with marks, the white searing scars on my lower legs are still tender now. No, that was no dream, and I know I've seen that man before.
