Strange things started happening after my mother-in-law moved in. Then I found out about the cult.
Experience
A few years ago, my mother-in-law moved in with us.

It was supposed to be temporary.

We live in a fairly large, three-story house—just me, my husband, and our daughter—so my husband converted the entire top floor into a private apartment for her. She barely comes downstairs. Keeps to herself, doesn’t talk much. Most days, it’s like she’s not even here.

Except at night.

At night, the quiet is broken. She suffers from what my husband calls night terrors, but I’ve never heard anything like them. About once a week, always sometime after 3 a.m., she screams—bloodcurdling, guttural screams that echo down through the walls. There’s crashing too—violent thuds that shake the ceiling above us. My husband says she throws herself against the walls. Sometimes the hardwood. He shrugs like it’s nothing.

One night, I got up to use the bathroom. The house was still, dark, except for the faint hum of the refrigerator downstairs. As I stepped into the hallway, the scream came—high-pitched, animalistic—and then a bone-rattling crash from the floor above. I froze. My blood went cold.

I ran back to the bedroom, breathless, and shook my husband awake. “She’s hurt,” I said. “You have to check on her.”

But instead of worry, I saw anger.

“She’s fine,” he snapped.

We argued until he finally stormed upstairs, only to come back down minutes later with clenched fists and red in the face. “I told you,” he said through his teeth. “She’s. Fine.”

He wasn’t himself that night. My husband—normally soft-spoken, hard to rattle—was furious. Shaking. He later told me he was tired of dealing with this, that his mother had been like this for over a decade and he’d grown used to it. But I haven’t. Neither has our daughter. And even though he claims she’s seen doctors and there’s nothing that can be done, I can’t shake the feeling that something is deeply wrong.

And not just with her.

Since she moved in, I’ve started experiencing things I can’t explain.

When I lie in bed at night, reading or scrolling on my phone, I sometimes feel two sharp tugs on the blanket—like someone grabbing at my legs. I’ll look down, heart racing. But nothing is there.

Once, while standing alone in the front yard—miles from the nearest neighbor—I clearly heard a man’s voice call my name from behind me. When I turned, there was no one there. Just the wind and the trees.

Then there are the.. "things" I see as I’m drifting off to sleep. Long, white, translucent strands—like jellyfish tentacles—slowly descending from the ceiling, reaching toward me. I spring up, rub my eyes, and they vanish. I used to think it was just my mind playing tricks on me, some kind of hypnagogic hallucination.

But then I found out something else.

Apparently, in the late ’90s, my mother-in-law was involved in a religious group. My husband calls it that. But after some digging, I found it was labeled—more accurately—as a cult. There were rumors of rituals. Strange symbols. Disappearances. He insists it was all blown out of proportion, that they left when he was 11, and that his mother was “never involved in anything weird.” Yet he also admits she packed their things in the middle of the night and fled hundreds of miles away, leaving behind most of their belongings... and everyone they knew.

I try to believe him. But lately, things are getting worse.

My husband—who’s never had night terrors—is now shouting in his sleep. Swearing and lashing out with his arms and legs like he’s fighting off something I can’t see. The last straw was a week ago, he started throwing punches and yelling and then threw himself off our bed into his bedside table. I screamed his name and he just got back up into bed and acted like nothing happened. It was absolutely terrifying. I was shaking for a long time afterwards. If he would have been facing my direction I don't know what would have happened to me. He refuses to listen when I try and tell him how scary this is for me and he says I'm being ridiculous and exaggerating the incident. So I’ve started sleeping on the couch, just until he wakes up for work. It’s easier than pretending everything’s normal. Sometimes I catch myself watching him from the hallway, just standing there, afraid to go in. It doesn’t feel like him anymore.

I keep asking myself: Is it genetic? Some shared trauma? Or something darker? Something... spreading?

I’m not a deeply religious person. I haven’t been to church in nearly two decades. But I’ve started wearing my late mother’s Celtic cross again. I keep her old rosary—blessed in Rome—in my pocket now, almost like a talisman.

And lately, I’ve been thinking about going back to church.

Because whatever this is...

I feel it's just the beginning.
