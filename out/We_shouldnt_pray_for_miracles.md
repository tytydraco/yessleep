“Hallelujah, praise the Lord!”

 The cry resounded throughout the dusty, sweaty crowd of people pushing in on me from all sides. I could feel the hot breath parting the back of my hair, see the whites of the eyes of the man rocking back and forth next to me. We all sat in newfound, stunned silence as the child took two, shaking steps, his wheelchair discarded behind him like an unwanted plaything. The tent pitched and billowed against the dry summer wind, creating a low rumbling, as if the heavenly host had begun a drum roll of anticipation.

 The boy walked into the outstretched arms of the Reverend, who scooped him up and held him aloft, a testament for the gathered crowd in this revival. I felt that familiar warm tingle in the pit of my stomach. I had been raised Catholic, and I used to even consider myself devout. But the world has a way of beating hope in the greater good out of a person. But prison is specifically engineered to do it with maximum efficiency. I rubbed my shaved head, wiping a glistening layer of sweat on my jeans, trying to stifle the hint of religious fervor that had reared its head again.

 But looking when the smiling boy pushed his wheelchair, the tool that had been his own little prison, I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a God. Rationally, I knew he could be a plant. A paid actor, just playing a role. But the possibility of healing, reconciliation, and a fresh start, is far sweeter than any narcotic the world can offer. I know that from experience.

 So, dragging my feet, I joined the line of petitioners waiting for their miracle. The usher directing the liquid flow of human bodies looked at me with undisguised disdain but waved me through regardless.

 “If you believe that it is God’s will,” The Reverend cried, spittle flying onto the nearest audience members, “You shall receive a true blessing tonight!”

 The next in line, a young couple, came forward as the ushers led them by the hand. I could not hear what words they exchanged to the minister as he leaned towards them, but I could tears falling from the young woman’s face. The lights began to surge, the music growing in intensity, as the preacher stood up and gazed around the room.

 “This man before me has asked for prayer to increase his faith, now what can be more fitting for a night like this?”

 The audience hung on the preacher’s every word, as they stretched out their hands. Intense silence filled the multitude, as the minister slowly touched the shaking man’s forehead. Then with an explosion of activity, the young penitent began to shake violently. His whole body was rocking back and forth like we were being tossed on a stormy sea, until his knees buckled, and he fell to the dusty floor, limbs flailing.

 The crowd gasped audibly, as the young woman he had arrived with was crying helplessly as his seizure worsened. Despite the distance, and the mass of bodies obscuring my sight, I could see murky foam pouring from his mouth, and hear the choked gurgle escape his throat.

 “There’s no need to panic now,” The preacher began again, his bravado returning, “Christ gave us the ministry of deliverance for a reason, didn’t he?”

 The noise of the crowd quickly turned from concern to a deafening roar of approval at the words, and outstretched hands directed prayer towards the quivering, prostrate figure. My perception became fuzzy, the fervor of the massive horde overwhelming my senses as they began to recite some portion of the Psalms over the sick man and the now silent woman. I was paralyzed, deciding between my options. Selfishly, I wanted to turn around now and pretend nothing happened in the large sprung tent I had stopped in on a whim. Walk back out into the park and go back to my mundane, everyday life.

 But I knew rationally that this was wrong. This man was clearly having a medical emergency, while hundreds of people prayed over him and did nothing more. My decision was made when I saw that the frothy spittle had started to fleck with blood. I began to cut my way through the crowd, weaving in between the throng of outstretched arms. I retrieved my cellphone and began to dial 911, but the operator’s words were completely drowned out by the exuberant chanting, singing, and glossolalia filling the enclosed space.

 “We’re in the Mountain View Park!” I managed to yell into the receiver end of my phone, “Just send an ambulance, maybe the cops too, I think he’s having a seizure.”

 With help hopefully on the way, I began to push forward even more, but it felt as if I was wading into waist-deep water as the shoulders, legs and torsos pressed in from all sides. Fortunately, everyone on the makeshift stage was too enraptured by the performance to notice my arrival. I walked up to the bald, beet red pastor, and grabbed him by the sleeves of his poorly fitted suit, shaking him roughly from his reverie. His eyes shot open and flashed briefly with a rage so venomous I took a half step back. His face then lit with a smile that barely shifted his pudgy face, but I didn’t realize why until I felt a pair of strong arms drag me backwards.

“Don’t interfere with the exorcism, do you want this boy to be damned?”

 The voice belonged to whoever held me in a sort of bear hug, firm but not crushing. I turned my head to see it belonged to the deacon who had been leading congregants one after another to the stage for their miracles.

 “He’s having a seizure; it’s been going on for way too long man!” I pleaded, while the deacon slowly shook his head.

 “Just have faith,” The man said as his eyes focused on the scene before us.

 I turned my head and felt my breath catch in my throat. The man was no longer laying flat on the ground, rather he was a few feet above it. The eyes of the crowd tracked as he almost imperceivably rose into the air. Then the tent resounded with a crack like a gunshot. I flinched but still saw the limbs of the floating figure begin to bend backwards at impossible angles, one by one, with their own deafening, painful snapping noise. In moments, the man who now hovered about one story in the air, resembled a crushed spider with all its legs bent inwards, as his body fell to the ground with a wet thud.

 I could hear parts of the crowd exclaim in fear and disgust, some even ran to the exit, but the majority held fast, hands lifted high in supplication, eyes shut to the horror taking place feet away from them. The stage itself was quiet, the crumpled form on the floor mercifully still in death, his lover collapsed on her side weeping, and the pastor looking on impassively. The preacher bowed his head for a moment, deep in meditation, before suddenly raising his eyes and declaring in a booming voice that the demon had been banished back to where it belonged.

 “Do not fear for what has happened to this boy’s mortal form, for even now I assure you he shares in our inheritance in God’s kingdom!”

 His words filled me with disgust, but I couldn’t take my eyes away from the lifeless, deformed corpse on the stage. What I had seen was impossible, but those words brought me no comfort as I watched the limbs begin to twitch once more. While the crowd continued to pray in the religious ecstasy brought on by this dreadful miracle, the once dead form began to stand once more, arms and legs slowly returning to their original position as he straightened up.

 When the figure rose to his full height, he looked out towards the crowd, eyes glassy and dark. One by one, everyone present became aware of the new horrifying spectacle and reacted with shock and terror. The now sputtering minister, started to lift his Bible and spout off some vain prayer when this thing quickly raised its hand over his forehead. In a mockery of how he had been anointed just minutes earlier in his life, the strung up, lifeless puppet touched the face of the minister as he gaped like a fish out of water.

 At first nothing seemed to change, but after a few moments the already substantial girth of the suited charlatan’s stomach began to bulge. He doubled over, a cry of pain and fear escaping his mouth, only for it to be followed by a puff of dark smoke. As the arms holding me began to loosen, I watched in pure fear as the smoke emitting from the man in front of me gave way to bright orange embers, and then his body erupted into red flames. In seconds the wooden stage caught ablaze, and the woosh of the fire was met by the cacophony of terrified cries as the crowd surged towards the exit.

 Finally wriggling free of my now slack jawed captor, I began to follow the fleeing congregation, feeling my feet sinking into the soft flesh of those unfortunate enough to be caught by the stampede. The immense pressure of bodies tore through the thin walls of the tent as thick, dark smoke began to fill the enclosed space. I felt I was about to be choked by the weight of bodies crushing on me from all directions, combined with the copious amount of smoke I had already inhaled, but I finally burst out into the cold, clear night as the crowd finally rushed out of the exit. I could hear the sirens coming from far off, in response to my call or the thick column of smoke I am still unsure.

 Screams echoed into the darkness as the now blazing tent caved inwards, dooming those who were either too slow or disoriented by the smoke. But the instant before the tent fell, I swear I saw a dark figure shoot out from the tent and ascend upwards in a blur of movement. In my mind, I can still faintly hear the hideous sound of what I can only imagine to be massive, leathery wings flapping through the cool, twilight air.

 I shivered, overwhelmed by the fear of both what I had seen and the horrible things I could only imagine, and for the first time in years, I prayed.
