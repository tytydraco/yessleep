There’s more ways than one to get lost on the backroads out there. I almost found that out the hard way.

I was with my college sweetheart at the time, Lisa. We both had a few years in the workforce after graduating and we were already burnt out. If there was a Resilience 101 course in college we would have failed spectacularly. She was working as an accountant at the time and I had just quit my job as a civil engineer.

“You know what would cheer us up?”

“Never having to work again?”

“The great American road trip!”

I agreed to it, of course. It seemed like a good idea. I mean how many people don’t dream about driving across the United States in an open car?

We were barely out of Sacramento when we reached the edge of the Mojave. I’d actually never had driven out of the state up to that point so I was lost. I stopped at an isolated gas station. I told Lisa that I needed to use the restroom but it was really because I had no idea where we were going.

I got out the car and told Lisa I was going to the restroom. But I walked behind the station where the men’s bathroom was and whipped out my phone.

I couldn’t let Lisa know that I got us lost. I had no job, I couldn’t let her know I was so hopeless that we were lost in this day and age.

I looked down at the bars.

Empty. There was no reception out there. We really were lost.

I went inside to buy water…but really to ask for directions. There was only one person there, a balding middle-aged man reading one of the magazines of the stand. It was a small gas station, one fridge for bottled water and coke, two, even you want to be generous, ‘aisles’ full of corn chips and bags of nuts. Suffice to say, the gas station only made its money from desperate travellers on an empty tank.

I handed over the cash and in my best casual tone I went, “So you wouldn’t know the roads to Tucson would you?”

The gas attendant smirked.

“Lost huh? No phone reception?”

“You’d think in this day and age right?”

He smirked again. “Go about fifty miles straight ahead and take the right on the fork. You’ll go down off the highway but it’s a shortcut to Tucson. Keep going straight from twenty miles and you’ll join the highway again. Saves you six hours.”

“Thanks mister.”

I hopped back into the car and checked Lisa’s legs resting on the dashboard. Damn I was a lucky bastard.

“You got lost and asked for directions didn’t you?”

*She had seen right through me.*

“I tried my phone first.”

“I couldn’t get reception either. So where we headed?”

“Fifty miles straight and then right on the fork.”

“Ride on cowboy.”

I have to admit, Lisa was right making me go on this trip. With the wind blowing through our hair, the vistas on the horizon, it made me feel like we were carefree and back in college.

We finally reached the fork.

“Right?” Lisa said.

“Right.”

We turned right and the cactus-filled desert actually started to be filled with trees and shrubs. A few miles on and there was tall grass on either side of the road. I guess cacti weren’t the only things growing out here.

A few more miles and we turned a corner. It was just sixty yards ahead before I screeched to a stop. There was a car across the road and what looked like two bodies out on the road. Just laying there.

“I think there dead” Lisa said covering her mouth in horror.

I leaned over the dashboard as if the few extra inches was supposed to provide more clarity.

“Should we call an ambulance?” I asked Lisa.

“Of course we should.” She whipped out her phone. “Shit.” She said. “Still no reception.”

She dropped her phone and turned to me. “We have to go help them. We can’t just leave them there.”

“Yeah of course, right.” I started the car again and only went a few yards before I stopped.

I looked at the road ahead of us. There was the two bodies, the car across both lanes of the road, and long tall grass on either side.

But there was no signs of an accident. The car was in perfect shape. No shattered glass. Even though we were sixty yards away the bodies didn’t look mangled or bloody.

I just stared.

“What are you doing? Drive! We have to help them.” Lisa was almost hysterical.

I just kept staring. I had the worst feeling.

“Doesn’t this seem strange to you?” I asked Lisa.

To this day, she has never given me as filthy a look as she did that day.

“The only thing that is strange, is that you’re not driving.”

“But how did they get there? They’re car doesn’t look damaged, it’s almost like it’s blocking the road. I’d have to partially go off the road to get around it.”

She was almost incredulous now. “Then don’t drive around them. Help them.”

“Lisa, I’m going to drive slowly around them, I’ll get on the other side, and if everything is okay we’ll get out and help.”

“That has to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”

We stared at each other in silence for a few moments before I turned on the car again. I kept the car at a really slow speed.

Forty yards away. The scene came into better view. There may have been a few scratches on the car but it definitely wasn’t damaged.

When we were twenty yards away I saw no glass. Nothing. Just two perfectly healthy bodies lying on the road, a man and a woman. I looked over to Lisa. She looked at me.

“Keep driving.” She ordered.

We reached the bodies on the road. They were a perfectly healthy man and woman. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the tall grass shaking and my instincts kicked in.

I floored it and nearly crashed my car myself. In a few seconds I had reached the other side and through the rearview mirror I could see the man and woman lying on the road stand up.

They looked right at us.

In astonishment I stopped the car. Lisa and I were just stunned.

The man yelled out “Hey, come back here!”

And that’s when it became downright terrifying. There was one man who stepped out of the tall grass on the side of the road. Then two women on the other side. Before we knew it, there was about forty people on that road, around that car, all of whom had walked out of that tall grass.

I sat there with a lump in my throat. I couldn’t even begin to know what I just avoided. Why these people pretended to be dead. What these forty or so people would have done to us if we stopped and got out of the car.

Then they started taunting us. Waving their arms at us. I was so disoriented that I drove off as fast as I could. I’m pretty sure I broke the land speed record I was driving that fast. We got off that road and back onto the main highway. Lisa and I didn’t speak the entire time until we reached the first small town we could find.

We told the sheriff and pleaded with him to stop those people, whoever they were. The sheriff shrugged his shoulders and checked it out but found nothing. No people, no car. We filed a report with the FBI but we haven’t heard back.

So I’m just writing this to tell you to be careful. The Great American Road Trip is something we all dream about. But there are roads out there that…well, I just don’t want to think about what could’ve happened that day.
