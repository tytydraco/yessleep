I need to recollect my thoughts, none of this will make sense otherwise, but I need to explain what's been happening. A few days ago I temporarily moved back to my hometown for my grandmother, see, she still lived where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest: a small, easily passable town. Not somewhere deep in the middle of nowhere but far enough from major cities that most people had no idea where you were talking about and most people from there would just say that you grew up in the sticks. The town may as well have been a time capsule, if it weren’t for the occasional car from this century and the one or two families that could afford a newer TV, it looked like nothing about the town had been improved or repaired since at least the 1950s. The school got its last coat of fresh paint maybe twenty years before I was born, the general store has the same hand carved wooden sign that the owner’s father had put up when it opened, and a few of the trees dotting the town have bird houses in their branches that hadn’t seen a resident since the Vietnam war at least. I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little eerie at times.

It wasn’t a bad place to grow up by any means and the people here are nice enough, but the notable thing about the residents is that they’re all very superstitious. This town is old so stories you heard around the campfire about a monster in the woods had been told from generation to generation, at least a quarter of the stories involved one of the supposedly haunted houses in town, and the rest were run of the mill monster in the woods someone's grandpa swore they saw. A few generations of that is enough for anywhere to develop local legends and superstitions surrounding them, especially in my family.

Grandma Joeann told me most of the legends surrounding the town that I still remember. When I was a kid she’d tell me before bed when baby sitting me; she always looked happy to tell them. “Your momma used to love these stories when she was your age, truth be told: they scared me something fierce when your great grandma told me hers”. She’d say “She was better at story telling than me. And these stories helped keep me and your momma safe.” Every bed time story was a little creepy to completely terrifying, hell sometimes she’d even turn it into a song. Looking back, each one was more of instructions or a warning rather than a regular “the scary monster was spooky, the end”. One story was about what she called “The Hollow Face” that would watch her through the window and her grandma would tell her to sleep with a sprig of Rosemary on her person because, “as grandma used to say: Keep away bad spirit”. I’ve tried asking her a few times about The Hollow Face and the garlic “Great Grandma called it that since I was little, honestly I think she just thought the name was snappy. The rosemary though, she said it kept her safe when she came to America, old family tradition”

I never forgot these stories, but a lot of the details got lost on me over time, but moving home did make them start to come back. My parents called me about a week prior to moving out here, saying grandma needed some more help around the house, her age was starting to catch up with her. My dad said they’d have a full time caregiver move in with her soon, but until then she needed that extra help. I didn’t mind of course, I was in between jobs at the moment and my hometown always had odd jobs to do. Plus, getting to spend time with her again seemed nice. I got a call from my dad on the way up: mom had driven her into the city that morning to visit a friend who was in the hospital, so I figured I’d surprise her when she got home the next day.  Driving through town was very surreal: the main road giving way to pot hole filled dirt roads, the old stop signs with rust on the edges gave a strangely comforting sense of nostalgia, and the small diner’s sun bleached plastic chairs were upside down on the wooden tables out front. Grandma's house was in the middle of town not too far from the old beat up park I spent most summers playing in, the outside had a few plants growing over and under the fence and the grass had not been mowed in a while but it still had her distinct charm to it. Inside she had had photos on the wall of me throughout my childhood amongst the piles of old art projects she’d tried and given up on over the years. Old handmade frames made from drift wood covered the walls, but one stuck out, next to the wood stove was a photo of me and my best friend when we were around fourteen. His real name I’ll leave out for privacy, but we’ll call him Todd. 

 Todd and I drifted apart after high school. I think he joined the military or something right after graduation, I wish we would've stayed in contact more. I thought about calling him or walking to his old house in hopes he or at least his parents would be home to kill time, looking at the photo reminded me of that summer: that photo I found was taken the day we first started an end of summer tradition or kind of ritual if you can call it that. We’d sneak off in the warm evenings near the end of July before Elk season to one of the small orchards on the outskirts of town. There was this herd of Elk that would come to graze every year, a pretty big one too; we never counted but I’d guess over a hundred at least. The game was: we would try to coax one of the elk to come closer as they were circling getting ready to fall asleep. If one of us were able to pet one without it getting scared off or getting into a defensive stance, we believed it would be good luck for a year. Looking back it was so dumb and dangerous, the elk were twice our size and we did it as they were relaxing, but we were kids who wanted to prove who was braver than the other. Also, like I said, we were raised superstitious; the idea of having good luck for an entire year was hard to pass up. My family wouldn’t be home for another day so I decided to head out after unloading my bags and a few boxes into the guest room. I hadn’t done this or even just watched an entire herd since I moved away and the last time we did it, my best friend had gotten so close to petting one, but got spooked at the last second. “A little good luck wouldn’t hurt right now” I thought to myself, maybe even some of it would transfer over to grandma.

It took a few minutes to remember what I used to take with me and about an hour to actually find all of it, grandma had her own system for storing things and to this day none of us understand it. I made my checklist and crossed everything off: A full meals worth of food, two bottles of water, one of grandpas hunting knives (He had a collection for years, even when I was a kid he didn’t mind if I took one), two flash lights, a water skin that was probably older than the house, one of the apples from the tree in the back yard to try and bribe one of the elk with, and a pinch of rosemary/fresh sage/and the ash we collected all put into their own bags. The herbs and ash I was always told to keep on my person, I had a small bag of each of them in my backpack growing up but it’s been years since I’ve seen that bag. With all of that I began walking through the town, I got some waves and hugs from people I hadn’t seen since I moved as they were preparing for the evening, as well as being hit with familiar smells. The smell of cedar and the Red Valerians a few neighbors grew out front, though the strongest was the smell of lavender, most of the town had at least one bush of it out front, always an ever present smell even now. 

It was starting to get towards sunset so I figured if Todd was home he’d be getting ready for bed, visiting him in the morning was probably more polite, but I might still have a chance to try and get some luck. I started to walk a bit faster towards the orchards, forgetting how quiet small towns get after living in a city for a few years, each crunch of the gravel underneath my feet hit me all at once with how loud it was. Thankfully the gravel quickly began to give way to the thick grass as I got to the edge of town, I could see the large brown wall of elk in the distance and began slowing my walk so I didn’t scare them off easily. As I got closer the sun had turned the sky a soft orange and pink, in this light how majestic but also just how large elk are came back to me, most were laying down with a few still grazing the flowers in the orchard towards the edge of the herd. 

I was able to get maybe one hundred feet away from the herd before one of the stragglers looked up at me, leafy greens and a red petal hanging out of its mouth as it chewed. I slowly set my bag down and quietly opened it up to pull out an apple, never breaking my stare at the animal as it finished its mouthful. A few other elk had noticed me, though they also just stared as I slowly waved the apple around to get one's attention “Hey buddy, wanna snack? Want an apple?’ I said as a I kept looking at the elk that had first seen me, surprisingly enough it did take a step forward. It didn’t run over, I’m not a fairytale princess or anything, but it did cautiously and slowly begin to approach. Despite its size, it almost seemed to glide over with how smoothly and cautiously it got walked, the elk's head stayed low and turned to the side to look at me better and I’m no expert on any animal's body language so I was ready to run if it decided to charge. It walked closer looking between myself and the apple, the elk was maybe ten feet out when the smell hit me: Lavender. I chuckled a little, guy probably spent the day in the stuff, honestly seemed kind of nice. When it got even closer I could see more clearly the way it was moving. It was weird, the hooves barely touched the ground with each step and its movements reminded me more of a cat trying to be quiet rather than a Elk being careful or curious. I sat down the apple in front of me and took a step back, again I’m not the elk whisperer or something so I didn’t expect it to eat from my hand.

It walked past the apple. He, I think it was a he at least, just ignored the apple completely. This weird animal almost stepped on it closing the distance, I froze up, I could hear it sniffing the air and then my shirt as it stood right in front of me. Sniffing my chest, the size and sharpness of its antlers began to really set in, I’d seen Elk die from charging each other full force with these things, even one quick head flick would be enough to take an eye out. “Huh haha cute little guy aren’t you.” I said shakily, reaching down to scratch the large guy, its head raised up as it began to smell the front pocket of my jacket and all at once I felt its fur: Rough. Not like fur with mud or dust from living in the wilderness, but almost like, like bristles on a boar. The hairs were stiff and almost sharp, part of me thought this was because maybe it was sick. I was pulled back to the moment as I felt the pressure of a light nip on my jacket. This guy was nibbling on the pocket. I nervously chuckled “You like this jacket, bud? Lucky day for you” Lucky, could be a cute name for an elk if not way too cute for something this big. Then it hit me, these guys had been snacking on plants and herbs all day, he might’ve smelled more.

I opened up the pocket and the elk stuck its nose and mouth in there. I started laughing, even through the flannel jacket it tickled a little. Until it wiggled its nose back out, it had the bags in its mouth and was chewing. Even the one with the ash in it.

The smile on my face faded as I watched its head turn to look directly at me, front of the head facing me, I watched the pupils move independently, slowly moving to look at me head on. The chewing got louder as it kept staring at me, my heart dropped as I heard it. “Lucky?” came out of its throat, like some was trying to force out a word with a mouthful of rocks. My voice. It said it in my voice. I froze, its lips began to curl inwards and the corners of its mouth began going back farther than any animal’s should. “Lucky?” it forced out again, the words coming out after its lips moved like a badly dubbed movie, the sound of dust and plastic grinding on teeth finished with the small Ziploc containing the ash broke open. Whatever this thing was, its strangely white teeth turned grey from the ashes, it licked the ash from its teeth. Before I ran, I swear I saw its eyes move, not that it was tracking me. The eye balls moved, slithering like golf balls through wet clay from their sockets to the front. The ever widening smile kept crawling back, until the edges slithered up the sides of its head, a sickening wet popping sound accompanying it until the corners of the mouth almost touched the new home of its eyes. 

I ran, the only thing on my mind was the sound of my heart in my ears from fear. I looked back behind to see if it was going to come after me only to see, in the last few minutes of sunlight its silhouette was stationary, the antler tips began to move. Almost wriggling in place, as I ran I could still feel the eyes piercing through me. By the time I got back into the town proper the sun was down, I saw porch lights being turned on as I sprinted down the uneven road, looking over my shoulder every few seconds, I heard nothing except for my boots on the gravel and saw nothing except for the occasional stray cat that sprinted across the road. For a moment I swore I saw one of the blinds snap closed as I ran past, my heart still in my ears as I kept running. I got back to my grandmother’s house and crashed through the door. I hadn’t locked it but in the moment I was thankful I didn’t. I’m writing this now in hopes someone can help me understand what I saw. Reading this over, I sound insane. I grew up with stories and warnings about shape changers of multiple kinds, but this thing ate the herbs that supposedly warded off many of them? 

I’m posting this here because Todd kept mentioning this site before we graduated, saying people posted their experiences with the paranormal and sometimes people had answers. If anyone has any ideas of what just happened please let me know. If anything happens tomorrow or tonight I’ll keep people updated.
