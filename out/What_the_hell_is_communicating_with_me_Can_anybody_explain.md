I hope I'm not alone in this whatsoever. I might as well not think about it, due to how much it confuses me. I switched my TV off before getting to sleep, so there was no one around to turn it on. I expected an easy night, considering the next day was my day off. But not everything can always work out, can it? Hours before sunrise, I awoke to my TV's LED screen lighting up the room. This ominous ambient noise was playing at a moderate volume. To say it was unsettling would be an understatement. Eager to see what was going on, I looked at the TV.


On the TV was an unmoving aerial view of my hometown's downtown area. It was almost colorless, with the exception being anything brown. Some dark stringy substance was hanging off of the electrical wires, puddles of a black liquid dotted the streets, and there were no moving cars or any people around at all. I watched on, wondering if it was part of a movie, TV series, or documentary. There was no narrator or change in scenery whatsoever. I waited for something to happen… but nothing did.


I grabbed the remote, then hit the Info button. Nothing popped up. I tried opening the TV menu, but it wouldn't show up. I had replaced the batteries for the remote the day before, so they couldn't have been dead already. I soon decided I was just too drowsy to process things correctly, then lied down to go back to sleep.


I don't know how long I was asleep, but at some point, I woke up to what sounded like two or three male adults arguing in my kitchen. I couldn't make out the words they were saying, and I was especially confused as to who these people may be. I got off my couch, then took quiet steps towards the kitchen. When I got there, I noticed a wall of pitch blackness, darker than the rest of the house at the hour it was, in place of the opening to the kitchen.


As I stared, I stepped on a creaky area of the carpeted floor. Everything went silent, making my heart skip a beat. Something gripped my wrist tight, then tugged me into the room, a void of nothing that replaced my kitchen. My stomach sank further with each passing second, and I wasn't strong enough to pull myself away, which only made it worse.


I was pulled straight for what felt like 30 seconds, which didn't make sense considering the small size of my kitchen. I wanted to speak… as well as move… but couldn't for the life of me. I was too frozen to do so. At some point, I was pushed against what felt like a brick wall, sending a fleeting pain alongside the cool chills. As the initial shock began to go away, I was able to speak.


“Wh-who the fucking hell are you?”


I did not expect them to speak… when they, or he… did, it haunted me to my core.


“Do for us what you would do for your friends or say goodbye to everything you love.”


Not even just what he said, but also his tone. Baritone, and it vibrated against every single part of my body. I froze up again, with a heavy wave of dread flowing through me. This time, I felt compelled to speak.


“Uh… like what?!”


I didn't catch how he responded, as I passed out from all the pressure right after I asked the question. I woke up on the cold tiled floor of a room I could thankfully recognize as being my kitchen. Based on the lighting, the sun was about to rise. I glanced at the digital clock on my microwave. 5:54 AM.


As I picked myself up, I was disoriented. I paced around the house, trying to make sense of what had happened. I contacted the police. Moments later, an officer arrived and told me the usual… he would alert the neighbors. I thanked him, but the sinking feeling in my chest wanted the house to be locked down and guarded by the army.


Mid-day, that day, I decided I would try to catch this shit on camera the next time it happened. At least, I assumed there would be a next time… and I dreaded it. I didn't even want to stay in my home, but, unfortunately, I had nowhere else to go.


The following morning, I woke up to my TV blaring that damn noise again. I glanced at the TV. It was showing the exterior of my home. Every window was smashed out, the black liquid was dripping out of the gutters, and I could see my face through my smashed bedroom window. I assumed that version of me was sleeping until the camera went in for a closer look. Once it got a closer view of my window, I could see the horrific reality. My head was severed, the rest of my body nowhere to be found. My room was filled with crows, flying about above the horror.


After pulling out my phone and opening the camera app, I hurried to the kitchen. To my ironic disappointment, the void wasn't there. I peered into the room. Overwhelmed by my nerves, I flipped the light on. I was expecting to see the man with the baritone voice, or a severed head, but there was nothing like that. The kitchen was normal. The cupboards, tables, etc. were all in their usual places.


With that, I decided to film the TV. I walked into the living room, then hesitantly glanced at the TV. It was showing the aerial view of the town again. As I held the phone up to record, I felt a hand run down my back. I turned back and saw a cluster of hundreds of tiny black dots hovering in the air, not at all illuminated by the light glowing from my phone. They hovered into my chest, numbing it to the point it felt non-existent or it stopped making sense, so to speak. My stomach twisted. I sprinted away, not wanting these freaks to do anything to my body. Around the area of the kitchen, I aimed my phone’s LED light back at the dots. They vanished into thin air, leaving me confused and breathing heavy.


I stuck my phone into the void, then pulled it right back out to avoid triggering anything. I hit stop, then played the video back. Just pitch darkness and those voices were all that was recorded. As the audio of the voices played back, the voices in the kitchen went silent. My heart sank and I sprinted for the front door. The porch light from the home across the street was shining through the door, so it's place was obvious in the dark. About a meter away from the door, my surroundings went pitch black. I froze in my tracks and the same baritone voice invaded me.


“If you're so willing to expose us, how about you give us a little help? Meet us at the Montauk Point Lighthouse at 12 AM, Thursday?”


I could see the porch light again. I looked back and could faintly make out the opening to the kitchen, but the way it should look without that void. Although the void was gone, I could still feel the vibrations from the baritone voice. They gave me chills. That day, I called my doctor to report hallucinations. I planned to show him the footage I took, in hopes I could get confirmation on whether or not I'm just seeing things. If he saw something completely normal, I needed help.


At an appointment about a week later, I played him the recording I took. He agreed it was weird. The fact he could see and hear what I could all but confirmed I wasn't hallucinating. I told him I had already called the police, and he gave me a confused stare. Eventually, he told me he had no idea what to tell me. I was at a loss too, not being able to grasp how this wasn't some prank or dream or hallucination.


So with that, what was the damn baritone voice talking about? I don't want to do anything for some freaks from who knows where. I barely wanted to go back home, but I needed to pack some of my stuff up so I could run from whatever infested my home. After doing so, I drove to the other side of town. I wasn't going back until that freaky shit was over. I especially wasn't going to that damn lighthouse. I parked in front of my town's community center, then called the police, telling them there was going to be a drug deal in the basement of the lighthouse at 12 AM on Thursday.


The dread is killing me. I cannot figure out what's going on. This doesn't seem like something the police would be able to help with, although the scary part is I have no idea who could possibly help. What is invading my home and why would they invade my home without expecting me to expose them? I can’t recall a single time this has happened before and a single reason for why this would happen. What do they want from me?
