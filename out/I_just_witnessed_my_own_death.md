I know this sounds crazy, but I think I just witnessed my own death. I’m still nauseous and trembling with fear after my ordeal, and with three hours of train journey before I get home, the ability to share my experience with the online community is the only thing keeping me from throwing up. I shall do my upmost to recall today’s events as accurately as possible for you, and to report my frame of mind as things happened, as I’m aware there may be a psychological aspect to all this.

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I want to make it quite clear that I am quite sane and prone to hallucinations or other irrational behaviour. That said, I have been known to lose my temper from time to time, even with my wife. These bouts of rage started when I was put into foster care as a teenager, and my tantrums may even have been justified at that time. But now I’m approaching middle-age, I find I’m being triggered by more trivial issues, such as inefficient processes at the firm, or my daughters playing music too loudly on their phones. Anyway, on with the story…

&#x200B;

The old lady had joined the train back at Exeter St Davids, and parked herself next to me without asking permission, which I had accepted at the time because the carriage was crowded. But since Bristol Temple Meads, the number of passengers had thinned out considerably, and I felt incensed that she hadn’t yet done the honorable thing and moved to a different seat. Beneath her thick coat, her wrists were adorned with elaborate bangles, that jingled every time she moved her knitting needles. At that time, I hadn’t yet faced her directly, for fear of initiating small talk. But from my side-vision, I observed her face and neck were wrinkled in the extreme. I could have moved seats myself of course, but I was already set up for work. Besides, to move would be to admit defeat.

&#x200B;

So in the typical fashion of a frustrated Englishman, I merely sighed and stared out of my window. Outside, a blizzard raged on and snow was settling around the railway tracks. With a bump, the train reduced speed to a slow crawl. I watched the large snowflakes swirl about in the wind, blocking out the pale afternoon sun. The numbing clouds of whiteness gave me a splitting headache, that wasn’t helped by the overpowering smell of lavender perfume.

&#x200B;

I tried to focus on my PowerPoint slides, but the words began to blur on the screen. I removed my glasses and massaged my temples with my finger tips. Perhaps my wife Margaret was right. I had been working too hard lately. But who else was going to steer the company through the merger, if not me? Simple Stanley? That asshole Abrahams? Perish the thought. No, the role required strength, and I never minded confrontation. That was (I considered) my superpower, and although colleagues often complained about my aggressive attitude, I could always claim in my defense to the board that I was merely passionate about my work.

&#x200B;

Overhead, a vintage-style GWR poster showed a group of wholesome children visiting a sunny Devon seaside resort. They reminded me of my own daughters, before they had discovered TikTok and boys. I seethed inwardly. It was easy for Margaret to criticise me for not spending enough time with the kids. Since the girls started school, Margaret has had all the time in the world.

&#x200B;

The old lady accidentally knocked my elbow with her knitting needle for the third time in as many minutes, and I slammed my laptop shut. I opened my briefcase and considered downing the can of lager that I’d been saving for the return journey from Paddington. But it was too early, even for me. So I read through my copy of the Financial Times, whilst trying hard to ignore the constant click-clacking of her grey metal needles. In an act of petty revenge, I ruffled the large yellow sheets of my newspaper near the lady’s face, and spread my elbows wide over our shared arm rest.

&#x200B;

“You’d think they’d provide us with more room in first class, wouldn’t you?” she said.

&#x200B;

“Yes. Perhaps one of us should move?” I muttered through gritted teeth.

&#x200B;

The lady ignored me and held up a garish half-knitted scarf. “It’s for my grandson.”

&#x200B;

“I’m sure he’ll love it” I replied sarcastically.

&#x200B;

“Do you have children?” she asked.

&#x200B;

“Two girls, ten and twelve” I replied, with an efficiency bordering on rudeness.

&#x200B;

“Daughters, what a blessing! You must be looking forward to getting back to them?”

&#x200B;

“To be honest, they’re usually asleep by the time I get home.”

&#x200B;

“Then it is no wonder you are sad” said the lady, and she placed her hand on mine.

&#x200B;

“Do you mind?” I said, as I yanked my hand away. Suddenly, my phone rang.

&#x200B;

“Aren’t you going to answer that?” enquired the lady.

&#x200B;

“No it’s just my wife” I shrugged. “She knows better than to call me on the train.” The phone kept ringing. Finally, I put it on silent-mode and locked it away in my briefcase.

&#x200B;

Much to my annoyance, the old lady leaned across and gazed out of my window. “Looks bad out there” she said. “Reminds me of the snows we used to get in Romania."

&#x200B;

“Listen, I don’t mean to be rude. But my time is valuable, and I really do need to work.”

&#x200B;

“Ah yes, time is a slippery thing” she ventured, before resuming her knitting. “Your job must be very important, to keep you away from your family?”

&#x200B;

“Yes it is!” I barked.  “And so is this presentation. So please just… stop talking.” Suddenly, something scratched me on the wrist. “Hey, watch it with that damn needle!"

&#x200B;

“Oh dear I am sorry” she muttered. “How clumsy of me.” I inspected my arm and was horrified to see she had actually drawn blood. She tried to help me roll up my shirt sleeve to tend to the wound, but I pushed her aside. “Perhaps I should move seats?” she said. I glared, and she promptly moved away.

&#x200B;

I mopped my bloody scar with a tissue, and looked up in alarm. Despite all the empty rows in the carriage, she had chosen a seat that was directly facing me. As I rested back in my chair, she hummed (in Romanian) the words to an odd little folk song. The whole episode had been exhausting, and I soon felt an overwhelming urge to take a nap. As my eyelids became heavy, I thought I saw the old lady give a sickening grin. Then as I drifted off, I noticed (through blurred vision) that some of her yellowish teeth were pointed, and there was blood on her fingernail.

&#x200B;

When I awoke, the train was stationary and the carriage was empty. With horror, I realised my laptop was missing from the tray. I looked under the seat and checked all the overhead compartments. My briefcase was missing too, along with my phone (which was inside it). The old lady hadn’t seemed like the thieving type, but what other explanation could there be? I felt inside my jacket pocket. Miraculously, my wallet was still there. Even more surprising, the cash and bank cards were untouched. I dashed to the next carriage, but it was empty too. “Guards?! Is there anyone about? I need to report a robbery.” I walked the length of the train, but there was nobody on board.

&#x200B;

Finally, I stepped out onto the platform. It was Westbury, a quaint rural station I knew well. Margaret had been a student at the local college, and I used to meet her under the station clock when we had first started dating.

&#x200B;

The train’s engines were still running, even though the driver’s cabin was empty. I made a mental note to make a complaint to GWR on the grounds of poor health and safety. I began to pass everything systematically though my mind (as my work had trained me to do) and concluded that the train must have been ordered to wait while the line ahead was cleared of snow.

&#x200B;

Overhead lights flickered on above the deserted platform. I surmised that the unusually dark skies had triggered them to come on automatically, and yet the station clock said it was still only two in the afternoon. I wondered whether there was a solar eclipse going on above the rolling black clouds that I hadn’t heard about. As a matter of habit, I reached inside my jacket pocket for my phone, and it took me a few seconds to remember it had been stolen. There weren’t any pay phones around either, so I couldn’t even call the office to tell them I’d be late for the meeting.

&#x200B;

I walked out of the station, but the concourse was deserted too. Furthermore, Westbury was one of those funny little stations that (for some unfathomable reason) was located several miles from the town it was actually supposed to serve. I didn’t care much for standing alone in the cold, and neither did I fancy walking along the gloomy country road into town. The snow turned to sleet, and I decided that I’d be better off waiting on the train, where at least it was warm.

&#x200B;

But as I walked back into the station, I heard the roar of an engine as my train was pulling away. I shouted and ran alongside the platform edge, banging my fists on the doors, but to no avail. The train disappeared around a bend and the station was eerily silent, apart from the pitter patter of rain.

&#x200B;

I tried the door of the waiting room and the toilets (male and female) but they were all locked. “Ridiculous” I muttered as I curled up on a bench. Suddenly I heard a loud bang, followed by the smash of glass. On the opposite platform, some yob (high on drugs it seemed) was kicking and screaming at a vending machine. He had his back to me, and wore a plain black hoody. “Hey you, stop that!” I called out. But the lad didn’t react. He just kept yelling obscenities and headbutting the glass. I dashed over the footbridge that separated the two platforms, but by the time I got to the other side, the lad had disappeared. The vending machine glass was shattered and smeared in blood. At that point, I clearly recall that I shuddered from a vague sense of Déjà vu.

&#x200B;

“Can you come out?” I called timidly. “I won’t tell you off. I just want to check you’re okay.” The sky had turned pitch black. I checked the station clock again and was alarmed to see that it was five already. I wondered whether something had gone wrong with my own time faculty. It’s odd, but ever since leaving the train, I had been in doubt about my place in the universe. And what about Margaret? She’d be out of her mind with worry if I didn’t call soon. I thought about her plight, and how sweet she really was, in spite of everything.

&#x200B;

An automated message rang out over the loudspeakers. “The next train at platform two is the five thirteen departure to Plymouth.” I was elated to hear another voice (albeit robotic) and looked around for the information screen. I walked on. The far edge of the platform was unlit and lined with dense fir trees that bended and rustled in the wind. Any moment, I feared that the yob might leap out from the bushes and mug me (or worse). When I finally reached a screen, it confirmed a train home to Plymouth was indeed due within minutes.

&#x200B;

I leaned against a green GWR shelter, a sturdy Victorian construction of wrought iron, designed to stand the test of time. Empty beer cans rolled about the entrance, and old newspapers fluttered about in the breeze. Suddenly, there was a low groan from within. I considered waiting elsewhere. But what if the lad was inside bleeding to death? I had never considered myself a first-class human, but I wasn’t a monster either. My hands trembled as I peeked inside. The floor was littered with polystyrene takeaway boxes, and the place stank of stale urine.

&#x200B;

“Care for a wee dram?” said a gnarled voice. I squinted my eyes at a moldy white blanket in the corner. The old tramp was about sixty, and in a bad way. He gulped down some Whiskey and wiped a trail of spittle from the bottle.

&#x200B;

“No thanks” I said politely. He was heavily bearded, and the parts of his face that were still visible were covered in scabs. He crawled out to join me. “I wonder, have you seen a young lad in a hoody?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“I ain't seen no one all night” he muttered.

&#x200B;

“Are you sure? He smashed up the vending machine back there. You must have heard?”

&#x200B;

The tramp grimaced. “Pay no mind to him. He’ll survive, you can be assured of that.

&#x200B;

“Oh. So you do know him?” I said. “Well you can tell that little thug from me, that he’s lucky I don’t report him to the transport police.”

&#x200B;

“Don’t be too harsh on the lad” said the tramp. “He’s had a tough upbringing.” The old man took a crumpled rollup from behind his ear. “You’re married” he said, as he admired my wedding ring.

&#x200B;

“Yes, for my sins” I joked awkwardly.  “How about you?”

&#x200B;

“I was. And reckon I got a couple of kids somewhere. But aint seen ‘em for a while.”

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry to hear that. I have young daughters, so I know how hard that must be.”

&#x200B;

“Can I see them?” he croaked. He gazed up at me with bloodshot eyes that were vaguely familiar. He reminded me of my great uncle George, the black sheep of the family, who had sadly passed away from alcohol poisoning a few years before. Or maybe it was just a look that all ageing alcoholics adopt, once they have been exposed to the elements for a certain period of time. “Please friend. Just a peek, if you will?”

&#x200B;

I removed my wallet from my jacket pocket, but naturally hesitated. For all I knew, his demand to see a photo might be part of some elaborate identity scam. Or God forbid, his wish to see children could be part of a more sinister desire. But he didn't strike me as that sort. In truth, I felt he was more like an old comrade, who had fallen on hard times. In the distance, a train engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness.

&#x200B;

“Please, we haven’t got much time” begged the tramp.

&#x200B;

I opened my wallet and handed him a polaroid photo of the girls. The tramp wiped a tear away and promptly handed it back to me. I cleaned some of his gunk away from the photo and put it safely away in my wallet. “You’re a lucky man” said the tramp. “And I have enjoyed our little chat. But this is where we get off.” With that, the poor man stumbled forwards and jumped onto the railway tracks.

&#x200B;

I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. An impending sense of dread, like one is supposed to feel immediately before a heart attack. I closed my eyes as the train rumbled past. But when it finally ground to a halt, there was no blood on the tracks, and no body either. I was pale with shock, and shivering from head to toe.

&#x200B;

A guard stepped out onto the platform. “All aboard” he called cheerfully. My legs wobbled and I found it difficult to move. I felt sick, as if part of me had died.

&#x200B;

“Are you alright sir?” said the guard. “You look as though you’ve seen a ghost!”

&#x200B;

I smiled weakly in appreciation of a friendly face. “I just need to sit down” I said.

&#x200B;

The packed carriage buzzed with noisy commuters, eager to get home. I found an aisle seat next to a rotund businessman who bent over backwards to make space. “Sorry to be a pain” I said to him. “But would it be possible to borrow your phone? I need to make an urgent call to my wife.” The businessman looked me up and down.

&#x200B;

“What’s wrong with yours?” he replied, gesturing to my phone, which was sticking up out of the tiny pocket on the front of my jacket. I gave a bewildered smile. The phone must have been there the whole time.  But it’s so odd, I never use that pocket. And how come I didn't notice the weight of the phone until then? The businessman clearly thought I was mad. He sighed and returned to his newspaper.

&#x200B;

I listened intently to a voicemail message from Margaret, and promptly burst into tears. She had asked how my big presentation had gone, and urged me to hurry home as she was making stew for dinner.
