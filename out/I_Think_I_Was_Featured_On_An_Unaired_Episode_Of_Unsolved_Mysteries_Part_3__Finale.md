[Part 3]

Right after I submitted part 2, I had more people creeping around my house late at night. It caused me so much anxiety that I couldn’t sleep for like 3 days, maybe 4? Then, I started to notice this guy was wherever went, I know I sound paranoid, but it was definitely the same guy. Not even necessarily following me, just everywhere I would go, this distinctive  looking guy would be there too. It took me a while, maybe a week or two, for me to remain inconspicuous enough to where I no longer felt that stress on me, I even stopped seeing him all over, too. Maybe the guy trailing me just got more sneaky? Maybe my mental state was starting to slip. it's highly possible. I was going to stay away for a little bit longer, but I finally heard back from the computer guy this morning. He narrowed the email sender's IP address to somewhere in Georgia. 

Apparently, the email sender had his VPN set up to expert levels. His, her? Anyway, the IP was rerouted through multiple access points from all over the world. Filtering out all of the fake locations wasn’t what took so long, PC Guy called in a favor and got me a phone number for my contact. PC Guy didn’t offer an explanation into how he came across this information. So I didn’t ask, and I just thanked him for his help. Like you probably guessed, I did not hesitate to call the number. And of course, no one answered, so I did what any smartphone carrying elder-millennial would, I sent a text. My text read, “Is [----Redacted----] your email address? We need to talk, call me”. 

About 3 or 4 minutes later, I got a call from a VOIP – buncha nerd stuff. Apparently, this person uses an app that allows them to make phone calls using a secure internet connection, probably from a burner phone, too. The call was uneventful, only lasting a minute at the most. It went like this, Me: “Are you the one who emailed me?” He replied, “Meet me at this address around 9 tonight and dump your phone, so you can't be tracked.” As I was starting to say, “What, why?” This rude ass hangs up on me. I did as told, but I made a mental note to cuss this guy out when I got to meet him. When 9 o'clock rolled around, I walked into the lobby of this rather fancy hotel. My legs were starting to get the feeling back after driving for over 3 hours to get to the meeting point. Considering I was dressed very casually, I felt my face getting red, hot with embarrassment. I’m sure I looked out of place and probably suspicious as fuck. I strolled over to the bar and sat there waiting nervously. I ordered a drink, and sipped on it while I waited, nervously. I then get an uneasy feeling, as I noticed a presence lurking up behind me. 

This guy takes the seat next to me, and before I go on… so call it a stereotype or whatever, but this dude looked like every shady computer hacker guy from any movie or TV show. This guy looked to be in his mid to late 50s, but still in decent shape, I’d call him skinny. He had the nerd glasses, anime haircut, a short-sleeved hoodie, camo cargo shorts, and some beat-the-hell up Chuck Taylors. Immediately, my mind says, “Why did he pick THIS place?” Alright, anyway, he sits down and we begin to make small talk. “What’s your name?” Shaking his head, “Nah, nah call me V.” Rolling my eyes, “OK V, what in the chicken fried fuck is going on here? Did you send me all that disgusting stuff?” Quietly, he says, “Yeah man, there’s so much you need to know.” Getting frustrated, I whisper-yelled, “Well, no time like the present, tell me? Was it me on that episode?” it was here for the second time today, that this asshole cut me off mid sentence, this time changing the subject. “You know why I picked this place?” he mumbled. I responded, “Actually, that I do wanna know, we both look completely out of place here.” 

“Of course we do. That’s the point. We need to establish strong alibis  from this moment on. We don’t need anyone trying to pin stuff on us, cause once this info breaks, we are both going to be in some presumably deep shit.” V proclaimed. The obvious look of confusion was etched into my face as I said, “Uh, I don’t wanna be in deep shit, I just wanna know if it really was me that TV show, and what any of this has to do with me now.” I didn’t necessarily want the info to break, for the sole reason being, I don’t want to live life constantly looking over my shoulder, y’know, the stress and all. Like, of course I want justice to the ones who might have done those kind of things to me, but not enough to live with the paranoia and anxiety giving me a heart attack on the daily. After a lull in the conversation, V says, “Thanks to a computer error, we have rooms here booked for a week. Here’s your room key, we still have lots to talk about.” V gets up and we walk to the elevator. That deep pit in my stomach steadily growing, as we ride up to the 17th floor. His room, 1703, and my, room 1704. He opens his door and invites me in, immediately I ask, “How do you know this room isn’t bugged?” My paranoia is at an all time high. “I got here a while before you and did a scan earlier, no hidden microphones, recorders, or cameras”, V reassures me. 

“How much do you already know?” V asked, not wasting any time. While shrugging, I told him about the ‘Finders’ and the Franklin scandal, the connections, and how I saw records of a kid with my birth location and my birthday, but it wasn’t my name. Next, I tell him about my theory. He stopped me mid way through to say, “You’ve got a lot of it put together already, kid. But allow me to fill in the gaps.” For the next, I dunno, 5 or 10 minutes he tells me the beginning. I was astonished by the story I was told. Here is what happened according to him; V, apparently went to school with my mom, and back then was working as a private investigator, and they were decent friends he said. Sadly, my parents were indeed a victim of this trafficking ring. 

Directly after my birth, the doctor took me away, he then came back to tell my parents that I had died. V said that the picture from the show was me. Now the crazier part, my mom reached out to V to get his help in getting me back or at least find out what really happened to me. So over the next 22-26 months, V infiltrated the ‘Finders’. When he got the news I was alive, he pulled some strings and kissed some asses to become my handler. My DNA had came back as one of the strong ones, so V was assigned to raise me. “Whoa,” was all I could muster. I stopped mid sentence, because one question had been burning in the back of my brain since I got the files, “How did you even come across this shit? How did you find me the other day?” V was cryptic as hell, “I’ve kinda been keeping tabs on you since I brought you back. Those files I took directly from their headquarters the night I escaped with you. Other files, I hacked in and took directly from their servers. I’m what you’d call an internet pirate, I digitalized those files with the intention of exposing these fucking demented assholes.” He finished, “It was pretty ironic that you love ‘Unsolved Mysteries’, it made my job of getting you involved very easy. But seriously kid, use a VPN.”

By this point it was getting very late, and I was painfully aware of that. I then  made my way next door to my room. I laid down, my mind still racing but surprisingly it didn’t keep me awake too long. The next day we continued the conversation. I was informed that shortly after my abduction, several other babies along with myself was trafficked to Nebraska. After getting me in his custody, he played his role for a few months, establishing their trust. After a couple more months, V was deemed trustworthy enough to be left alone for him to raise me on a day to day, unmonitored basis. Almost immediately after gaining that freedom, V then fled with me in the middle of the night. He drove non-stop all the way from Omaha back to South Carolina to reunite me with my mom. V explained that I was chose seemingly by someone informing the higher ups of my impending birth, that the doctor at the hospital that night was one of the ‘in network’ doctors. It was apparently a very well worked out plot, basically wrong place at the wrong time. “So, what now, V?” I asked. A grim look was on his face, “We hafta kill you.” My jaw dropped, “What the fuck?” A devilish grin exploded from V’s face, “Just so we can get you a new identity, social security number, birthday, the whole nine yards. As of right now, the you as you know, is dead.” 

“Oh, uh, OK.” Was all I could come up with. V set up a meeting with a contact of his from the deep web, dark web, hell I dunno? We left the hotel, and drove a couple of hours to this deep web guy’s ‘off-grid, secured bunker’. This guy went by the name, Fenix. He looked so normal, like just some regular ass guy. He had on a pair of casual khakis, a solid color polo shirt, some small animal on the right chest, and a pair of clean lounge shoes. Nothing at all like what I had imagined. This ‘bunker’ was a trailer sitting on a clear spot in a very heavily wooded area. No mailbox, no address, no driveway, but it was much more than meets the eye. The trailer was just the living quarters. 

There was a custom built - addition to the trailer leading from the back door, and was completely finished, with the matching siding, gutter system, and 3 small windows. Inside of this addition included an office space, furnished with an elaborate desk with a filing and shelving setup. On the desk sat a curved monitor, with two matching regular flat screen style monitors positioned and affixed to the top. The computer tower wasn’t a tower, it was like built into the desk with LED lights illuminating the PC components encased in plexi-glass. I dunno the specs of the computer, but from just looking at it, it came off as ridiculously expensive, and ridiculously impressive. There was an overstuffed couch, y’know what I’m talking about, very plush, sturdy, comfortable, perfect for a nap type couch. A large screen wall-mounted TV on the opposite wall. Last, there was a door that led down a flight of stairs and into an even more custom built cement structure. I wouldn’t exactly call it a basement, more like a laboratory, or the BatCave?

This area was more than twice the size of the trailer, starting only a foot or two below the ground. Even though this area was underground, it was no less tidy, clean, modern and top of the line. A small PC server rack sat in a closeted area, soundproofed with a self-controlled climate system. There were small rows of LED light fixtures on the ceiling. Several monitors mounted to the wall displayed a full of set of security camera images being tracked in real-time from all angles around the compound. More seemingly invisible PC towers powered another set of monitors on a different wall. These displayed news websites, stock market tracking sites, and 24-hour news channels running non-stop around the clock. A separate work station was in the corner, allowing access to the darker side of the internet, and a total suite of hacking software and gadgets. This is where we would spend most of our time. 

There was a private area walled off with a full-sized bathroom and walk-in shower, as well as a bright, sterile, emergency center styled treatment room, with a hospital bed, all the health monitoring equipment, tools, and a whole host of supplies. Outside was an iron reinforced cement walls standing at least 10 feet tall. Razor wire and electric shock fencing running the entire perimeter around the top of the walls. There were squared pillars every 10ish feet also going around the perimeter, and attached to each pillar was a 35 foot antenna and satellite arrangement disguised as a pine tree. On the sides of each antenna facing the inside of the trailer were large rain collecting apparatuses which fed a constant supply of water to the facility. Also using an ion-gathering reverse double osmosis generator mechanism, the water system that would turn water vapor in the air into clean water and was capable of storing large quantities for use during times of little rain. 

There were several smaller structures scattered across the sprawling acreage of land. On the roof of every building including the trailer, and security walls was a state-of-the-art solar panel system. The panels were fed into a highly efficient grid system running on an automatic cycle for the storage and consumption of energy. For plumbing necessities it had a series of pipes that sent reusable water back through the ingenious filtering system, and all waste water into an oversized, intelligent septic system that was programmed to separate solid from liquid waste, and efficiently mulching the solid waste with food waste into a nutrient rich fertilizer. I was blown-away from how self-sufficient and self-sustaining this was. This felt like light years ahead of its time. It was later explained to me that the entire area was a decommissioned maximum security surveillance outpost used by the US military. Fenix said the only things he did was bring in the trailer for a comfortable living space, and he replaced all the electronic components to get the facility in working order. 

We never discussed how Fenix got ahold of this expansive facility or the money to do all of this, in my opinion, another person’s money isn’t any of my concern, but based on how elaborate and technologically advanced everything was, it had to be multimillion dollar project. This place was as off the grid as it gets, being top-level classified, the bunker wouldn’t show on any map, and the air space above the bunker was listed as a no fly zone by the US Air Force. “As complex and complicated as it looks, with a simple flip of a few switches, this place basically runs itself.” Explained Fenix. After gawking and totally nerding out, we started to get to work with Fenix exclaiming, “This isn’t my first faked death. But to do it right, we hafta be as thorough and meticulous as possible.”

The antenna and satellite system allowed us to have a very reliable internet connection running through a custom 5G relay router, and programmed with a military-grade encryption algorithm – whatever the hell any of that means. This was as secure and private as you could ever imagine to be. V and Fenix went over the situation and Fenix took the flash drives. The plan was to obviously fake my death, and to do it convincingly they needed about 4 to 5 pints of my blood. So it was scheduled that every third day or so, I’d give one half to one whole pint of blood. It was incredibly rough on my body, I was unbelievably tired, exhausted. I had to constantly eat and drink to maintain my strength, high protein, high electrolytes. It was the worse, but I knew it needed to be done. In fact, nutritional shakes became a side dish with every meal. 

I gave all of my current info to Fenix, my social security card, my ID, anything that linked me to my old name. Fenix made some very high quality forgeries, and hacked into every database he found my info and changed my status to deceased. Fenix took my blood and poured it all into the trunk of this beat up car, then drove it out to a heavily wooded nature park and trail system. Making sure to park in a prominent place, he set fire to the car. He left my wallet in back pocket of a pair of my pants, some of my other clothes, ID and other documents in the trunk, also covered in my blood. Using some deep fake voice technology, and a virtual cell network, Fenix called in the car fire to the local authorities, pretending to be an innocent hiker. 

Now that I was ‘dead’, Fenix had us stay with him for a while, allowing me to fully recuperate from all the blood donations. Next, I was given tips on how to alter my appearance, growing my hair and beard out, dying them darker. Fenix said for me wear my glasses at all times, and to get more tattoos to hide any identifying scars, including my branding scar. I kept a very low profile for the next two weeks, never leaving the bunker, while the investigation into my apparent death went on. The official report came out, saying that the heavy loss of blood meant there’s no way I was still alive, but the case was investigated as foul play. It was only after my faked death that I started to finally feel some of this anxiety beginning to ease. While in hiding, I received an email back from the ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ crew person. The email essentially said, that the network pulled that episode at the last minute due to some push back from some of the big advertising sponsors. At that time, the evidence into the cults and kidnappings were just unsubstantiated rumors and yet to be confirmed. The show as a whole would’ve been canceled, had they not scrapped that episode. 

The next evening, Fenix was digging deep, through the flash drives, and found some banking records from the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union showing large deposits to Deutsche Bank, with connecting wire transfers to accounts in the Cayman Islands belonging to unsubstantiated dummy corporations. He also found what looked like a promotional pamphlet, advertising their private island for booking a party, or vacation. The pamphlet bragged, “All inclusive, just give us your age and gender preferences, any kinks or fetishes, and we’ll handle the rest”. The island was located several nautical miles from the east coast of south Florida. There was a private jet that shuttled people to and from the island, and enough housing to easily accommodate 200-300 people at one time. 

The price to rent the island for one week started at 3 million dollars, with upcharges for optional things like having a traditional masquerade ball, or the setting up and staging of rituals and other things of the like including illicit substances referred to as, “party favors”. The ultimate boast was, “Located in international waters, no risk of unwanted attention”. There was also a pamphlet offering a similar set up in Sweden where the age of consent is only suggested and hardly enforced. Being much more lenient towards those things, and very blurry lines when it came to what’s legal and what’s not. It was absolutely sickening to see these people bragging about this depravity, and making boatloads of money off of it. 

V mentioned that he never saw that before in the huge box of evidence he took, but it didn’t surprise him that it was there. Even still we just couldn’t believe how blatant they were with this. We next did a little research on my birthmark -brand mark- for any possible cult ties or connections to the evidence files. There wasn’t really anything that we found that matched, the closest thing to it that we could find was the Uroboros. The Uroboros is like the snake or dragon thing eating itself, ya know? Mine is very simple, and not detailed, at all. Just one side of the circle bigger than the other, kinda “eating” the smaller end. From our research it’s a symbol that is commonly used to mean something is infinite – never dying - 

After a lengthy discussion, Fenix and V decided to systematically leak all of the data to the community of hackers and investigators on the deep web to continue looking for survivors or signs of present day occult activity. To me, it’s unclear what they hope to accomplish, these are the richest, most protected people on the planet, I don’t think they’ll ever be able to actually catch, or arrest any of them. At this point, I felt like I was still in this mix, basically against my will. I wanted nothing more than to forget about all this, and have some kind of normal life, whatever that means.

I didn’t sleep that night, but what’s new about that? The following morning I was having breakfast with V and Fenix, while trying to distract from all this recent craziness, V said, “I’m sorry to hear about your mom passing away, I know that was rough on you.” Nodding, I replied, “Yeah, up until just now, that day in June was the worst of my life.” Despite all this stuff going on, my mom’s passing was still pretty heavy on my heart. I had tried to make it a daily thing to remind myself of one lesson that my mom taught me. Being on the run and constantly overwhelmed made that difficult for me. V was shoveling a handful of bacon in his mouth, “Did you remember what D24 is?” Caught off guard and completely bewildered, “Uh, no, I had forgot all about that, considering I most likely had a hitman after me for who knows how long. What is it?” V looked at me with a disappointed frown and changed the subject, “What did you do with the things your mom left you?” 

Confusion plastered on my face, “Hell, I dunno, it’s a banker’s box full of old baby pictures and stuff, I was grieving too much to go through it at that time, and then I just forgot about in the back of my closet.” Using his expert counter surveillance techniques, V stealthily went and retrieved the box from my house, I couldn’t do it since I was ‘dead’ and they’d definitely be looking for me. When he got back, he told me that he didn’t notice anything suspicious at my house, but he couldn’t be 100% sure that they weren’t watching my place. He took the lid off the box and we started to go through it. The very first thing on top of everything else was a small key, which had a tag on it that said D24. 

It apparently went to a storage locker, that was in my mom’s name. The bill was prepaid for like a year in advance. The next night, I went and opened the locker. Surprisingly, this place was open 24 hours and I went pretty late, heavily disguised and making sure I was the only one there. See guys, my mom fought liver cancer and cirrhosis on and off for the better part of 8 years, she must have put all this together, knowing that her time was drawing close. The storage locker contained some stock information and banking records showing she had put her account in my name, an old, dusty photo album, and a short letter. There were photos of little baby me, my mom, dad (I’m assuming) and two other people. They were laughing, hanging out, having drinks, just living their best lives. 

I know you guys are probably dying to know what the letter said, I was too. By this time, I literally could feel my heart beating all throughout body as I opened the simple envelope. My palms were heavy, my knees were weak, and sweat was beading up on my forehead. I’m not going to transcribe the entire thing, because I want it’s full contents to be just for me. The big messages were this; before I was born, my mom had gotten very close with her best friend and long-time coworker, Lilly Draven. My mom stated that Lilly and Dominic used that friendship to take advantage of her. They ‘moved away’ right after I was taken. Lilly and Dom were the other two people in those old pictures from before I was born. They were real people and the ones who set up my kidnapping, with the ‘network’ doctor. 

According to V, Lilly and Dom were probably compensated very handsomely for what they did. The letter then speculated that, V discovered that after I went missing, those cult members who were considered responsible for me being taken back from the cult, then orchestrated the segment on ‘Unsolved Mysteries’ as an attempt to find me before it reached the upper echelon that the cult had be infiltrated. They even filed a missing persons report. It would seem that it was Lilly and Dom’s job to look for ‘marks’ to target for trafficking and whatnot. Since Dom and Lilly were responsible for my kidnapping, they would be the ones to pose as my parents on the show. And at the 11th hour, the entire episode was pulled, ruining their attempt to get me back before the news about my escape got out. Mom said that’s probably one reason they never caught up to us. After getting me out, V went completely off the grid to hide, but he always monitored us, keeping us safe in the background. 

The next message was very hard to take, I never mentioned this before, because it didn’t seem relevant to the story, but my dad wasn’t in the picture anymore. I never even got to meet him. After I was ruled dead by the doctor, my dad grieved, then he started to move on, he went back to work, trying to have some kind of normalcy in his life. My mom on the other hand, just wouldn’t accept that I was dead. This caused irreparable cracks in their relationship, my dad trying to heal and move on, and my mom fixated on me being alive. They would drift apart, and soon they divorced. After several months, my dad, lost in a bottle of liquor, sank into a deep depression and it became too much for him to endure. He un-alived himself, before mom could contact V for help. 

My mom never told me, she didn’t want me to somehow feel guilty, blame myself, or be upset with dad. She never really said anything about my dad, if I asked she would tell me not to worry, “We’re all we need”. Over time, I just stopped asking, we had a decent life that I knew, I was obviously oblivious. Mom never really talked about anything negative. I didn’t even feel it at first, but oversized teardrops were streaming down my face, crashing into the paper in my hands. Mom’s last message was to trust V, and to not let what happen make me jaded. “Life’s too short to spend it angry”. 

I will remain in contact with V, and Fenix, but it was a unanimous decision that I never go back to my old house. So now, all that’s left is to start a new life, step one: giant sized chest tattoo. I’ve already died my hair darker, and got new glasses with frames. I gauged my ears to 17mm and got my lip pierced. I’ve always liked that kinda style, and with the look being so popular, I think I’d blend in just fine. In my opinion I don’t look anything like I used to, but I still have a way to go. I don’t honestly think I’ll ever be fully free of the anxiety and paranoia, but at least I know how to better protect myself. Mom left me enough money to move somewhere that I can truly start over, be anonymous, and once and for all, have that life that she wanted for me. However, I’m going to stay on the run for awhile, until I can more easily slip back into society. Where should I go to start over?
I could’ve kept all this to myself, but I strongly feel like it needed to be told, to get as much info into the public as possible. 

Finally, to all of you incredible people who helped in any way, I am beyond grateful. I appreciate every comment, every DM, every ounce of love and understanding that you all showed me. 

And that, my friends, is all about the time I saw myself on an unaired episode of ‘Unsolved Mysteries’.

Also, I sent my hand written transcripts of these events to my friend to translate them into an easier story to follow, he’s a much better writer than I could ever be. That here is what you’ve been reading. He also posted these to his account to help me remain anonymous and to keep myself from having to make a throw-away profile. Thank you for understanding**
