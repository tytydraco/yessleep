I knew this would happen. I tried to convince myself that it wouldn’t, but I guess some things will never change.

All I can say is that these experiences have taught me never to be open about them and to acknowledge their existence only in silence.

Today, I crossed the line.

I watched some videos about auras and other spiritual concepts. I decided to look at objects with a different perspective. I also saw some unsettling things, but I brushed them off, thinking, “It’s fine, never mind.”

But it’s not just about the recording today. The first encounter I had was when I was a kid. It was inside the mirror. I remember seeing the reflection, but it wasn’t showing me. It was showing a completely different reality. I could see my loved ones calling me, urging me to come closer. But I always knew it wasn’t really them. Still, it would say, “It’s fine, come on, come to me.” But I never dared to reply or even get close.

Once it realized that I wouldn’t come near, it changed its approach. The entity started talking to me, saying random things, laughing, and showing me strange images in the mirror. I even told our house helper, and she admitted that she didn’t feel comfortable near that area either. After that, I stopped sleeping on that side of the room. That’s when I experienced my first sleep paralysis, or at least, that’s what I thought it was.

I remember crying, begging, but my body wouldn’t move. From my neck down, I was frozen. It was terrifying. But that wasn’t the worst of it. Later, something happened that wasn’t even sleep paralysis. When I would sleep, it felt like I was outside my body, watching myself rest. Then it would come, grabbing my leg so violently that my entire body would slide. I could feel it. And if I really wanted to, I could have woken up. But I never did. I refused to let my consciousness bring me back. It kept pulling, trying to make me wake up and see, but I resisted. Eventually, it stopped.

But lately, as I’ve been more inclined towards spirituality, it feels like I’ve been drawn closer to that other side again. Even as I write this, the hair on my body is rising. I know it senses that I’m talking about it, but I had to post this today.

Then, today, something strange happened. I went to the bathroom and came back to find a screen recording on my phone, recording the exact time I wasn’t in the room. My room was locked. The recording stopped automatically the moment I got back to my bed.

I need to get rid of this presence again. If I sense him, I know he’s sending me too. Every time, even at the slightest acknowledgment of my psychic side, it tries to pull me in. I’m not weak, but it makes me feel like I’m being watched, like it knows I can see it.

I want to forget again. But how long can I keep running? It’s been here since I was a child, and I know where it resides. Should I still remain ignorant?

I don’t want to confront it. I’ve tried before, and things went terribly wrong.
