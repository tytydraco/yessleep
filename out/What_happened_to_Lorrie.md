I am 34 now, but this all happened when I was in 1st grade, back in April 16th, 1999. I remember that date clearly, as it scarred me for life. This event still weighs on my mind to this day, and I fear it is happening again.

On August of 1997, that's when I first met my best friend, Lorrie. We were in Mrs. York's kindergarten class and we just clicked. We love making up stories, drawing our characters and making them going on adventures. I'm sure if we discovered DnD at that time we would be hooked.

After the first day, we discovered we were just a few houses away, and that's when we began to spend our afternoons in each other's yards, playing, doing whatever 5 year olds do.

Lorrie had an older brother, can't remember his name, but I vaguely remember he was two years older than my older sister, Becca, who was 10, so that would make him 12. They both would always joke that Lorrie and I would make "a cute couple".

"I see your boyfriend is here," Lorrie's brother would tease when I show up.

"Nick! Your girlfriend is here!" Becca would call out to me when Lorrie comes to my house.

We usually try to fight them as we tell them we are friends. Even my uncle, Oscar, would join in on the teasing.

By the time we reached 1st grade, we ended up going in separate classes, Lorrie was in Mrs. Johnson's class while I was in Miss Whittaker's. But we still hung around at recess, playing and talking about what we each did in class. When school let out, Lorrie's brother and Becca would pick us up and walk us home. Lorrie's brother and Becca wouldn't talk as much, but honestly I never noticed as Lorrie and I talked about our day as if we haven't seen each other in years.

Now, the horrid date.

Friday, April 16th, I remember seeing Lorrie in a pink dress, a black bow holding back her dark brown hair, and she looked annoyed when I walked up to her house so we could walk to school together.

"Is it picture day?" I asked, looking down at my plain clothes.

"Gotta go to a [Can't remember what family event she was going] after school. Instead of changing after school Mom thought I should wear my dress. It's dumb," she grumbled.

We swung on the swings before school started, talking about our plans for the weekend, and I remember feeling sad as she will be gone all weekend, but was excited to hear about her weekend at this family event, which she promised to tell me. The bell rang, and we went to our classes.

Fast forward to recess and we sat on the swings, as Lorrie promised her mom she wouldn't ruin her dress when a classmate asked us if we want to play tag. Lorrie and I figured it would be an okay game to play so we agreed. We were playing for a while, and I was zooming around the playground, avoiding the boy who was It, not paying attention before me, until I hit my head hard on the bridge that connected the two play areas of the playground.

I remember falling back, my vision blurring.

"Nick?" I heard Lorrie asked me.

"I'm okay," I said, sitting up, but suddenly feeling dizzy.

Then the bell rang, recess was over.

"Should I take you to the nurse?" Lorrie asked me.

"No, I'll be okay," I told her, walking toward my class.

I remember the worried look on Lorrie's face but she reluctantly joined her class.

I remember I felt off the rest of the day, my head throbbing, my vision blurring a bit, and just generally confused.

I didn't wait for Lorrie after school as her parents were picking her up, so I walked alone with Becca, still feeling off. I didn't tell anyone about my head injury, as I thought it wasn't that bad, but I felt so tired. When I got home I decided to take a nap on the couch, to sleep the strangeness off.

When I awoke from my nap, it was already dark, but I knew I felt a lot better.

"Look who's up from the dead," I heard someone say.

I spotted a girl who I never seen before, yet I knew I knew her. I just looked at her confused.

"Oh good, your awake, want something to eat?" Mom asked me, poking her head from the kitchen, but I just couldn't take my eyes off this familiar stranger.

"What!" the girl snapped, then rolled her eyes and left towards the kitchen.

I cautiously approached my mom in the kitchen when I spotted both Becca and the girl doing homework. Maybe it was Becca's friend, but I remember her friends, maybe a new girl Becca befriended? But why does my gut tell me it's not true.

Mom made me a sandwich, which I took and hurried to the living room, trying to process it all. 

As I ate I looked up at my TV, and above them was the family portrait. My parents, Becca, me, my younger brother Ryan... And the girl from the kitchen.
That was Penny, my eldest sister.

But, I knew that was impossible. I knew for a fact I never had an older sister named Penny. It was only Becca. But I knew that was true somehow. That's my eldest sister. How could I forget?

I knew I needed to talk to Lorrie about this, because it felt so strange. Maybe she remembers her too? Did I hit my head hard enough that I forgot Penny?

I was cautious around Penny, still unsure if I could trust her, even though she was my sister. By Monday, rushed to Lorrie's house, eager to give her my news, but she wasn't at our waiting spot. I waited a bit longer, but I knew I was going to be late if I waited. I felt bad going to school without her but I couldn't be late myself. Reluctantly I ran to school alone.

By recess, I asked one of Lorrie's friends about Lorrie, thinking she might have heard from her.

"Lorrie who?" she asked me.

"Lorrie..." I trailed off, because at that moment I forgot her last name. I always remembered her full name, but my mind only could think of the name Lorrie.

"She's in your class, you two made a volcano together," I said.

Her friend only arched an eyebrow, "You mean Thalia?"

I knew something was wrong. Thalia was Lorrie's bully, and this friend avoided Thalia too. We got into an argument to the point a teacher had to break us apart. I was taken to the principal's office, first time I ever went, and that's when I noticed the other thing. My school name. It wasn't Washington Elementary anymore, but Lincoln Elementary.

At first I thought I was at the wrong school, maybe that's why I didn't see Lorrie. But I knew that wasn't true. I just withdrew within myself, unsure what was true anymore.

First, I found out I have a sister name Penny, then I discover Lorrie never existed, and now the school name change?

I couldn't figure out how to tell the principal about this as it sounded crazy, so I just said I was confused. I just didn't know what to do.

Years passed and I just went on with my life, wondering what happened. When I heard about glitches in the matrix, I thought, "is that what happened to me? When I hit my head, I went into another universe where Lorrie never existed but Penny did?"

Now, years later, I feel like it's happening again, because I sent Penny a birthday text for her eldest daughter, Vanessa.

"Nick... I don't have a daughter named Vanessa."
