To whom it may concern,

I beseech thee, help me return to my world. I'm writing this glass tablet my captor left unattended by my cage. I've seen him use it to send invisible letters, or so I've gathered, and hopefully whatever magic he uses will work for me as well.

I'm in a domicile in a place called "Two-Sun" The walls appear to be made out of some sort of cracked paper-like material. The odd thing is that the house is seemingly able to move at the will of the owner. Hopefully this narrows things down enough for you to locate me.

I should introduce myself. I am an autumnal pixie of the Seelie Court by the name of Leafblossom. I am an intrepid explorer and cartographer by trade. I entered this realm through the ancient art of tree-hopping: using the magical properties of various trees to transport between dimensions. However, when I got to this realm, I found my magical powers waning rapidly. It's my hypothesis that large amounts of cold-forged iron, or some other magic-sapping metal, have permeated the air around your hives, or perhaps just this hive in particular. I was unable to locate a return tree before I was captured. He was riding this iron four-legged spider-horse, and drinking mead out of an immaculate glass bottle wrapped in brown paper. He was upon me before I could react, and I haven't been able to escape his clutches since.

My captor appears to be some form of local magistrate or lord. The less said about him and his cohorts the better. Their corrousing is... obscene and shameful. If someone could rescue me from him, and bring me to the nearest "american chestnut" tree, I would be eternally indebted to you. I know the whole of your race can’t be like this. There must be humans with compassion and mercy. I’ve been to many dimensions, and every species that forms society has had such virtues. I know that despite your outwardly frighting and gigantic appearance, you have the same capacity for goodness as us pixies. I have to believe it, because the idea that I am trapped in a land of monsters who could swallow me whole is too horrifying to contemplate.

I must make haste. He returns soon. Please, I beg of you, find pity in your heart. I... I need this to stop. He hasn't let me out of this cage in a season or longer. I don't know when he'll leave this tablet in arm's reach next. I will grant any boon or do any service in my power for anyone who helps me, I swear on my true name. Please, just have pity.

I must go. Thank you to anyone who reads this. There's a possibility I may gain access again in the future, so reply letters would be appreciated, if for no other reason than to keep my spirits up. If anyone could help explain the strange ways of you humans, I would appreciate it greatly. Despite my circumstances, I am still interested in this dimension.

Safe travels,

Leafblossom
