It was an average Saturday, the Friday before was an average school day: schoolwork, lunch, talking, you get the deal and I was tired as always. At about 5 in the morning, I woke up to the ringing of my doorbell, seeing as how my parents were out taking my brother and sister to a doctor's appointment farther away from our home. Thinking nothing of it I got up, put on my glasses, and went downstairs to see what was going on. That was the worst mistake I ever made. I opened the door to reveal a medium-sized box that had no type of markings on it, it was also a little beat up, but what do you expect from a UPS delivery? I brought the package upstairs not thinking anything of it because my parents order things somewhat commonly so this was pretty normal.

  
Afterward, I went along with my daily routine of brushing my teeth and eating breakfast, stuff like that, and I noticed that the box had moved from the initial spot where I placed it, I searched for it and found it in my closet for some reason. I don’t know why but I had a strange feeling to open it up. Now I usually don’t open boxes from our front door because it’s my parents' stuff, but this felt different, it didn’t feel like my parents ordered this, it felt like this was for me. Following this feeling I opened the package, and inside was a simple bear plush. This was unexpected, I felt so compelled to open a box for a stupid plushie?

I threw the bear in frustration seeing as it made me feel for no reason. I looked at the clock on the microwave, I was so worried about that stupid bear that I didn’t realize what time it was. I hurried and did all of my chores, I looked at the time again and noticed that strangely my family hadn’t returned from the doctor’s office. I tried to look for that bear because I felt bad for throwing it so aggressively (I knew it’s an object but I still felt remorseful) and I couldn’t find it, so I just said “F\*\*\* you” and went along with my business.  
I called my family to see where they were and what they were doing but they wouldn’t answer. Whilst I was calling I saw something go into a room. At this point, I was now in a panicking state, I tried calling anybody I could but nobody answered, I decided that the best course of action was to leave my house and search for help. but for some reason, when I opened the door, it just led me right back into my house. I think maybe a week later it started collapsing in on itself. It became some type of maze. I can only describe it as a mixture of objects from my house, the same type of walls, flooring, and roof. But it just felt off I walk around for a while and realize there doesn’t seem to be an exit.

I checked my phone because I was curious. It actually turned on! And worked normally? I opened one of my media apps and started scrolling, the videos had an odd feeling to them and the comments didn’t feel human. I was sitting there for a while and I noticed that for some reason my phone hadn’t lost any battery life and I still had an okay Wi-Fi connection. Whilst I was pondering the odd behavior of my device I saw that same creature I saw before and went into panic mode once again and started running in a random direction I was 90% sure I lost it but I also didn’t want to take any chances and see what it will do if it catches up to me.

It seems like no matter where I go, no matter what I do I always seem to end up in the same place. I also see the furry creature sometimes on my wandering, and when I see it I just start running, because that seems to work. It's been a month I think? I’ve lost track of time, it’s felt so long yet so short. I don’t know what I did to deserve this fate. I don’t know why i’m here. I just know I need some type of help because the thing is showing up a lot more frequently than usual and I am running out of energy.
