**Chapter 1**

Divorce is a void. A space left behind when you realize you missed the mark so badly that your entire moral compass bent trying to justify it. You start questioning which version of yourself was real, and which one you built just to survive the marriage. When it ends, that hollow doesn’t close. It waits.

She’s in Thailand now. She always talked about Asia, markets, temples, the way the world felt older there. I was the anchor that kept her docked, stranded. Five years built on a version of me she thought she understood. When the truth finally surfaced, she didn’t scream or cry. She packed with a kind of calm that hurt worse than anger ever could. I don’t blame her. Some nights the weight of my family’s disappointment still presses down on my chest, but mostly I feel lighter. Empty. Like I can breathe again without measuring every inhale. Like something essential has been misplaced, and the body hasn’t realized it yet.

I chose to move to the coast.

A small desolate town pressed hard against the ocean, far enough from everything familiar that the past might finally lose its echo. I told myself I needed salt air. Space. A horizon that didn’t judge me. The decision felt practical, almost random. Looking back, that’s what unsettles me most. 

The town itself looks like a postcard someone forgot to mail. Bright cottages with peeling paint. Sculpted relics of a life meant to be admired from a distance. Empty paved streets. Gulls screaming overhead like they’re arguing with the sky. Paradise, if you don’t linger.

The people linger.

They watch. Not the curious glance you expect from small-town locals sizing up a newcomer. This is different. Their faces stay flat, unreadable. No smiles offered. None returned. It took me three days to notice because I didn’t want to. Three days before the awareness settled in and refused to leave. 

The house I rented is old and salt-stained, close enough to the beach that the waves sound like they’re inside the walls. The wooden floorboards make unsettling noises, not when you walk on them, no, when its quiet. The only real selling point was the rent. Cheap places don’t ask questions. 

Percy loves it here. He’s all frantic energy and blind optimism, as all golden retrievers are, convinced the world exists purely for his entertainment. With all things considered, I have one thing, one responsibility that keeps me level-headed most of the time. 

Routine feels like glue, something that might hold the broken pieces together long enough to forget they, we, were separated. Every morning, we walk the same stretch of sand. 

There’s an old woman.

White hair, thin and brittle. Skin so pale and creased it looks like wet paper left too long in the sun. Every morning, when I walk down to the beach from the rental, she’s there, framed perfectly in the upstairs window of a pale blue, two-story house set back about four hundred feet from the entrance path. Half-hidden by dunes and scrub grass. A place you wouldn’t notice unless you were already looking.

She doesn’t wave. Doesn’t nod. Doesn’t even seem to blink. She just stares. Not at me. Through me. Like I’m something transparent that happens to be in the way.

I told myself she was sick. Dementia, maybe. My grandfather had the same stare near the end, vacant, but fixed. As if his mind had already left the room and forgotten to take his eyes with it. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just felt a small, uncomfortable pity for her, whoever she was.

Then I saw her again.

At the other end of the beach.

I’d walked the full length, maybe a mile and a half past the rocks. Near the exit path sits a gray-shingled house, smaller, closer to the sand. About fifty feet from where the boardwalk begins. She was there, in the upstairs window. Same posture. Same folded hands. Same white hair and withered skin. Same empty stare, now aimed back toward the way I’d come.

I stopped walking.

The distance didn’t make sense. The houses are too far apart. There’s no direct road between them, just dunes and private lots. Even if she’d left the moment, I passed the blue house, she would’ve had to sprint the entire way to beat me there. And she was old. Frail. The kind of old where stairs are a negotiation.

I called it coincidence. A sister, maybe. A neighbour with the same posture and haircut. This town has a type if you look long enough.

But the next morning, she was back in the blue house window.

And that afternoon, when I walked the beach again, she was in the gray one.

Same time. Same position. Same stare.

I started paying attention after that. Counting. Eight times now. Always the blue house when I arrive. Always the gray house when I leave. I changed my routine to test it, came earlier, stayed later, took different paths. Once, I pretended to head back and doubled through the dunes to watch from a distance. She was always there. Waiting at whichever end I approached.

I looked up the addresses. Both houses are rentals. Different owners. No shared names, no history I could find. Yesterday, I stood beneath the gray house window longer than usual, just staring up at her. She didn’t move. But for the first time, I noticed something wrong.

The glass was fogged, just slightly, around where her breath should have been.

Except, this time, no one was standing there.

I don’t walk the full beach anymore. I turn around halfway.

But this morning, when I reached the midpoint and looked back toward the entrance… the blue house was too far away to see clearly. And yet, there it was. A blurred silhouette in the upstairs window. Watching.

One morning the sky turned the colour of bruised metal. Clouds stacked fast, wind whipping the dunes into frantic spirals. The waves were taller than I’d ever seen them, crashing hard enough to shudder the sand beneath the soles of my feet. Percy went wild, barking, lunging at the foam. The leash slipped from my hand, and he bolted straight into the surf.

I ran after him, heart hammering.

A shape, vaguely face-like, carved briefly in wet sand.

It lasted less than a second before the next wave erased it. I stopped dead. When I looked toward the blue house, the upstairs curtain dropped fast, yanked shut in a way that felt sudden and panicked. I stood there with the wind screaming around me, in a nonsensical sound that can only be described as angry voice in the near distance. I told myself it was pareidolia. Percy shook freezing water all over me, and the beach rushed back in all at once. Wind, waves, barking. The place where I’d been staring was smooth again, empty, and I couldn’t remember when I’d stopped breathing. I walked back along my own footprints. Halfway there, I realized I wasn’t the only one using them. A second set ran alongside mine, slender and wrong, matching my stride exactly.

I still play piano when the mood hits. The house came with an upright in the living room, badly out of tune, but serviceable. One evening I was working through an old piece, slow and minor, when the air changed. It grew thick. Humid. A smell rolled in, sour and human, like breath held too long.

Then a voice, low and wet, right against my ear.

“Sshh”

It wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be. Every hair on my neck stood up. I turned fast. Nothing behind me except the dim room and the black window. But for a second, just a second, I thought I saw the last edge of a shape slipping outward through the glass. The pane didn’t open. The landlord had every window welded shut years ago after the previous tenants left them open during a massive storm. Excessive, I’d thought.

A gust of air moved past me, outward toward the welded shut window, carrying that same rotting breath. On the glass, a patch of fog swelled then another beneath it, larger, lower, shaped wrong.

I stared at it for a second too long before understanding what I was looking at. My hands came off the keys like they’d been burned. I haven’t played since. I keep telling myself it’s stress. A new place. A new life. Normal people imagine things when they’re alone too long.

But I know what I felt.

And I know what I saw in the sand.

Something here doesn’t think I’m lost.

It knows I’ve arrived.
