I’ve been sober for 10 months now, and every day is the same. I see the man beckoning to me; in my dreams, in my thoughts; I see him on the side of the road on my way to work. Always cascaded in red, wearing that damned full brimmed hat. He waves me to him, but I never go. I can’t. What could he want from me? I’ve been behaving. Not a sip of alcohol, hell, not even Nyquil. Not after that night. That was the worst night of my life, I had died, hadn't I? 

I was planning to quit. I kept telling myself, and everyone else that. I’ve carried on for too many years. But it was going too good for me; a new job, she stayed with me through it all, my kids were healthy, and thankfully that night, were safe. I, for one, was far from it. 

I had to have had 13 Natty Ice’s in that night. A great start to quitting, huh? I was flying high, I had more beers, more cigarettes, and about 10 hours till work the next day. The Nyquil was not needed. I should’ve known it was a bad idea; we used to put smokes into Nyquil and smoke it to get high. My booze brain wasn’t working. God I wish it had.  

2am came quick, so did they. They were everywhere. They laughed at me through the window; the serpent and the hag. The eulogist remained silent. He stood behind them; a candle preceding my vigil, it seemed.  

The all-black serpent weaved between obstacles in the yard. From the street to my front door, but I dare not let it in. I could hear the enhanced sound of scales on grass, upscaled to a point that sounded like hail on a tin roof. Its golden-eyed face paused inches from mine; I could smell the stale scent of beer on its breath. 

The hag glared with too-big teeth, phantom green eyes, and a burlap potato sack dress, she spoke no words, but howled enthusiastically, pointing at me through the threshold of the door. They dare not enter into my home, for what reason, I can’t say. The laughing amplified to a scream, it hurt my head, and it made everything blur and stigmatize. 

But the eulogist. He just stared. I couldn't see his face to determine his emotion, but I believe it to be shame. He wore a brimmed hat, a fedora maybe? He had an empty crystal glass in his right hand, and a cigarette in the other. He took a drag, and the cherry illuminated everything around him but his features. His unknowing gaze gave me such a burning, and itching sensation. Like a severe frostbite. Every inch of my skin was fire, I couldn't escape it. The warm July night didn’t make the pain subside; the only thing that could was that damned Nyquil, and that fucking alcohol.  

I downed another beer, and the pain, and my guests disappeared. Until the next drink was gone. They returned, and this time they were angry. They knew my intentions after this night. They knew I was going to quit. They wanted me to quit on their terms, which I knew wasn’t good. They wouldn’t let me quit until I was 6 feet under. Each character sent my senses into a frenzy. My brain was in a loop, it was telling me this wasn’t real. But it was real, in my head.  

A cloud hung over my head as the serpent snaked itself into the threshold of the side door, while its eyes were still trained on mine. The hag grabbed my shirt collar, and tried to pull me from my home. The snake grew tendrils, and flowed over every inch of the window next to the side door. Small, rope like appendices snaked their way around my home. They engulfed me, scrambled my senses, blinded me, and shoved me into the open arms of the hag.  

I was caught. The hag’s cackling wormed itself into my brain, the stigmatizing lights faded to black, and they wrestled me to the ground. I tried to close my eyes; shut my senses off to the heralding tension these things were putting onto me. But the worst feeling of all, was the eulogist. I couldn't see his face, still, but somehow I could tell he was smiling. 

I awoke in an ambulance. Tina and David, who I knew from town to be paramedics, were sticking me with an IV. The monsters were gone, it seems, but the darkness and the pain remained. God, what I wouldn’t give for a drink, or a smoke. I couldn’t see through the rear door-windows, it was a clouded glass, but I knew what would be waiting for me when I let my guard down. The ride to the hospital felt like hours, but I knew exactly where we were going: where my worst nightmares awaited. 

The IVs wouldn't stay in; the 3 horrors made sure of that. The serpent had me embraced with its too-many tendrils. The hag would remove the needle every time the nurses inserted it; smiling with her too-long teeth. She licked her lips with her boil-strewn tongue and howled with ecstasy. The eulogist sucked on his cigarette, all the while without revealing his face. The needles would give me euphoria for the few seconds it was in, then disappear, every time the shadow man lit a new smoke. He was pulling the strings, I realized. The doctors didn’t know why the IVs wouldn't stay in, but I did.  

The tendrils pulled me tighter, so tight that I couldn’t even lift my head to observe what the creatures were doing. But it all went dark, and time stood still.  

They won. I lost.  

I was dead.  

But not for long. My arms looked like raw meat; bruised flesh from the entrance and exit of the countless needles used to keep my demons away. And it worked. But those things took a piece of me. That day I died; they took away 20 years from me. I was 11 when this pain started, and the suppression in tow. I was 31 when the suppression was taken away, and welcomed back was pain, tenfold. 

I haven’t seen the hag or the serpent thing in months, but I can feel them. The man is still here, the orange glowing tip of his cigarette, that stinks of old rolling paper, and pipe tobacco smoke. His hat casts a shadow, as he’s feet taller than me. His hands rest an inch above my shoulders; because he can’t touch me. Not yet. But he will; one of these times that he beckons to me; in my dreams, in my thoughts. On the side of the road on my way to work. Always cascaded in red, wearing that hat. 

On the worst nights, I see him, sitting at a bar, his back to me; the barroom lights creating an eerie silhouette of a man that won’t say a word, but I know exactly what, and who he’s waiting so patiently for. He beckons for me to take a seat next to him, so he can finally give me that last drink, and pat me on the shoulder, and welcome me back.
