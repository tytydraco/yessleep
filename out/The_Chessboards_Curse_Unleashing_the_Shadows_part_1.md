As I nervously typed "en passant" into the search bar, not expecting anything unusual, I was met with a new response that dropped like a bombshell. My eyes widened as I read the words on the screen, feeling a shiver down my spine. It wasn't a search result; it was a live video feed showing an actual zombie, desperately begging for help.

The zombie's ghastly appearance sent chills down my spine. Its rotting flesh and hollow eyes were a stark reminder of the horrors that lurked in the shadows. The message accompanying the video pleaded for me to call the exorcist before it's too late, before the zombie's malevolent presence consumed everything in its path.

Unable to ignore the urgency in the zombie's voice, I quickly dialed the number provided. The voice on the other end of the line was calm yet filled with authority, instructing me to keep the zombie contained until help arrived. With a newfound determination, I rushed to gather supplies to face this holy hellish threat.

As I returned to the room where the zombie had appeared on the screen, I noticed a chessboard placed on a nearby table. The pieces were arranged in a peculiar formation, unlike any chess game I had ever seen. The bishop was missing, as if it had taken a vacation and never come back.

A surge of realization washed over me. The chessboard and the zombie were connected. This was no ordinary zombie; it was a pawn in a sinister game, trapped within the chessboard's dark magic. The pieces on the board seemed to come alive, emanating an eerie energy that filled the room with knightmare fuel.

Remembering the message from the video, the words "Queen sacrifice, anyone?" echoed in my mind. I realized that the only way to break the curse and save the zombie was to make a sacrificial move. The stakes were high, and time was running out.

As I contemplated my next move, a sudden gust of wind blew through the room, extinguishing the candles and plunging it into darkness. Panic set in as I heard a low growl, followed by the sound of scuttling footsteps. A pawn storm was incoming, and I had to act swiftly.

With a trembling hand, I reached for the lighter in my pocket and ignited the chessboard. Flames danced across the intricate patterns, illuminating the room with an unholy glow. The pieces on the board started to tremble, their movements becoming erratic and unpredictable.

As the flames engulfed the chessboard, a sinister laughter echoed through the room. The growls grew louder, and the scuttling footsteps became more frenzied. It was as if the presence of fire had awakened an even darker force within the room.

In the midst of the unleashed chaos, I noticed a small figure emerging from the shadows. It was a kid named Pipi, a mischievous and cunning child with a reputation for causing trouble in the neighborhood. With a wicked grin on their face, Pipi reveled in the pandemonium they had unleashed.

Pipi's eyes gleamed with a malevolent delight as they taunted me, their voice filled with a twisted glee. "You thought you could save the zombie, didn't you? But you've only played right into my hands," they sneered.

Fear coursed through my veins, but I refused to let it paralyze me. I knew that defeating Pipi and breaking the curse required more than just physical strength. It would take cunning, strategy, and a deep understanding of the dark forces at play.

With the flames still crackling and the pieces on the chessboard trembling, I mustered all my courage and confronted Pipi. "Are you kidding ??? What the **** are you talking
about man ? You are a biggest looser i ever seen in my life ! You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you! You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for
me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all! I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 Blitz World championships, and that should be enough… No need to listen for every crying babe, Tigran Petrosyan is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off…" I declared, my voice filled with determination."

Pipi's eyes narrowed, their confidence wavering for a moment. They had underestimated my resolve. With a flick of their wrist, they conjured a gust of wind, attempting to blow out the flames and regain control. But I stood firm, shielding the fire with my body, refusing to let it be extinguished.

Drawing upon my knowledge of the chessboard's dark magic, I realized that Pipi's power was derived from the pieces themselves. If I could disrupt their connection to the chessboard, I could weaken Pipi's hold over the room.

With a surge of inspiration, I lunged towards the chessboard, snatching up the remaining pieces. As I held them tightly in my hands, I could feel an energy coursing through me, a blend of fear and determination.

In a bold move, I hurled the pieces towards Pipi, scattering them across the room. The moment they left my grasp, the flames intensified, casting an ethereal glow on the chaos that unleashed.

Pipi's expression twisted into one of shock and disbelief. Their powers waned as the connection to the chessboard was severed. The room trembled, and the growls transformed into agonized screams.

As the flames continued to dance, the curse that had ensnared the zombie began to dissipate. The ghastly creature gradually regained its humanity, its rotting flesh transforming into healthy skin, and its hollow eyes filling with life.

With a final burst of light, the flames vanished, leaving behind a room filled with the scent of victory and the echoes of a battle fought against darkness.

The zombie, now free from the curse, looked at me with gratitude in its eyes. It spoke in a voice filled with a mixture of pain and relief, expressing its gratitude for being released from the clutches of the game.

I realized that this ordeal had not only saved the zombie but had also taught me the power of resilience and the importance of standing up against evil. As I basked in the triumph of the moment, I knew that I had become a hero in my own right, a defender against the forces that sought to manipulate and harm.

And as for Pipi, their reign of terror had come to an end. They were left to contemplate the consequences of their actions, knowing that their malevolent schemes had been thwarted.

With the room now filled with a sense of peace, I turned to the not actual zombie and asked if there was anything I could do to help it further. It smiled, its voice filled with gratitude, and said, "New response just dropped :-)."
