A wall of twisted frail arms sprouted from the doorway covering the path and pushing upwards. The appendages slammed into the metal wall leaving dents and splattered crimson blood. Fingers curled backwards and bent unnaturally as they drove into the wall breaking on impact. Knuckles pierced through the veil of skin on the hands like hot knives through butter. Forearms and elbows made the sound of crab legs cracking open as bone ripped through the black charred skin. Goopy meat and maggots oozed from the holes the deteriorating bones had punctured as fragments of the ulna fell sprinkling onto the oozing meat. Dozens of eyes and scattered teeth peaked out from cracks between the arms embedded in a wall of flesh under the hands. The flesh was black too, burned to a cinder with ribcages and spines poking from the burnt ends of its folds. Mold had crawled up the bones infesting the gory blob and eating away at its cooked skin flaps. Broken limbs that were too far gone to be used folded back, breaking more bones as the skin got tighter on them and seemed to age rapidly in seconds while retreating back into its body. Restless arms reached out from the bottom of the stack of gore ready to pull itself towards us, the fingernails missing and pink bleeding holes left in their place. The fingers grabbed the floors and walls pushing blood out of the nail beds and thrusting the monstrosity towards us. It let out a monstrous roar as it leapt, clinging to the walls and pushing off of them for speed.

Ethan slammed the door shut as Kirsten screamed at the top of her lungs. He pressed his body against the door as the thing slammed against it trying to force it open. Rob joined in, throwing himself at the door as me, Gavin and Lynn scrambled to the exit. We pushed on the door but it didn’t budge. “It’s locked…”

Lynn stepped back about two feet as Ethan and Rob grunted trying to keep the beast from opening the door. “MOVE!” She cocked her foot back and drove it into the door delivering a metal clang. She tried again and the door moved outward causing a crack to emerge. It was gonna open. But as I thought we could run, as I thought we would escape, dark slimy blood leaked through the crack and teeth littered the ground. 

The thing had trapped us. Split itself into multiple parts and was using one part to block the door. Maybe blocking all the doors to the outside. We were already in its stomach, surely to be ripped apart at any second. But then the banging on the hidden door stopped. Ethan and Rob stopped grunting and Kirsten looked up from the curled position she had taken in the corner. 

“What the hell…” Ethan mumbled as Kirsten looked into each of our wide scared eyes.

“This can’t be r-real…”

Pitter patter sounds followed from the main path into the attraction. It was loud and fast. The thing was sprinting towards us from the path trying to catch us off guard. Rob lunged for it and tried to swing the metal door shut but the little wooden wedge on the bottom kept it in place. I leapt off my feet swinging my hand low and swiping the wedge out from the door just as we saw dozens of hands springing from the darkness. Rob slammed the door shut and we heard the crunches of the It slamming into the thick metal of the door. I helped hold it shut with all my might as It pushed against the door. Then I heard running behind me.

“Kirsten!” Gavin yelled as she ran down the right employees hall. More pressure slammed into the door as we struggled to keep it shut. From the left side we heard running. It was coming. The others rushed to run with Kirsten as we let go of the door and bolted. The armed abomination flooded through as we made it to the other employees hall. Before I slammed the door shut I saw the two amalgamations of limbs slam together conjoining as one and lunging for us.

I slammed the door shut as Rob wedged a wooden board against it. The board wouldn’t hold for long, the force of the thing was stronger now, we dashed to the security room in an instant. We heard the two by four snap behind us and the slapping of the things palms against the concrete floors gaining on us. “C’mon!” Gavin yelled again as we rushed for the security room.

We ran through the metal frame of the door and Gavin slammed the metal door shut on It and locked it shut with the handle and deadbolt. We stepped back wheezing and coughing barely together at that point.

“Where’s Kirsten…” Lynn shakily mumbled. We looked around not seeing her then we looked through the door with the fiberglass window. The door was open and she was on the other side, in the jailcell room, about to dash down the path to find another way out in a fearful frenzy.

“Kirsten!” Rob screamed but it was too late. The door slammed shut and flesh covered the border of the window as arms appeared from both ways out of that room. Kirsten's screams joined Rob's, he banged on the door desperately to no avail. Ethan tried to help him open the door but the flesh had a better grip. Ethan gave up, wrapped his arms around Rob and pulled him from the door. He knew it was too late. 

In three minutes hell was shown to us in this place. I timidly walked to the door as the others held Rob, he was sobbing hard, his body filled with tremors. I looked through the glass. I shouldn’t have. I don’t know what made me do it. Maybe everything was moving too fast and I wasn’t thinking. All I know is I shouldn’t have looked through the glass.

The hands were swarming her, holding her down and binding her arms and legs. There were an uncountable number of hands on her. They groped up and down her body tearing at her clothes. They punched into her gut and wrapped around her throat, silencing wind being knocked out of her lungs. A hand grabbed her face and tried to scratch beside her eye. The lack of fingernails prevented it so it pinched her eyelid and ripped to the left. She wailed in agony as the eyelid and skin around her left eye was torn off as a strip. Her eye spun and gushed blood in the skinless slot. A hand entered her mouth grasping her jaw and twisting it to the side. It crunched and her wail became muffled, broken. The tears of her right eye were mirrored by the blood seeping from her left. Hands wrapped around her fingers bending them backwards and sideways and forward over and over again until the skin was loose and they tore off with a pop. Teeth gnawed at her legs, ripping small chunks from them slowly and plucking the bones of her knee apart leaving her legs flaccid and flailing. The hand in her mouth ripped her lip down, splitting it from the gums. Blood seeped from her mouth as fingers pushed their way into her belly, twisting and curling inside bulging through her skin. Her wails became wheezes as she died in agony, slowly, either that or the fingers reached her vocal cords. Her uninjured eye stared at me, it felt like a dagger plunged in my chest as that last tear in it fell.

From the swarm of arms I saw it. The sheeted figure but the sheet was falling. I was the only one who saw it, not just Kirsten's horrible death but that thing.

The sheet slipped to the side revealing it. There were three heads. Two heads where the shoulders should be and one in the center. The one to its left was a larger skull with flaps of meat still hanging from its lips. Long dark hair ran out of the flesh and down its back and its eyes were feline in nature, the pupil a slit of red.

The left was a smaller skull with completely burned bits left and cracks through its temple. It looked like a child's skull. The teeth were missing and the eyes were stones jutting out of the skull's eye holes, forced in so hard it caused outer cracks. But the middle head was far worse.

Tarantula mandibles covering a rotten brown grin with a gaping hole infested with worms where the nose should be and dozens upon dozens of eyes covering the top half of its head, all differing sizes. No flesh or eyelids were separating the eyes so they rubbed together scratching each other and growing pink with the amount of irritation, veins blossoming underneath the sclera. The pupils were broken yokes to the eyes running down and coating its mandibles. Its body looked grotesque but humanoid despite the missing arms. From it ribcage goat legs hung down and a pile of intestines and organs writhed openly from the gaping hole where the stomach should be. From the waist down was the black flesh blob and the arms protruding out. What looked like spider legs held the gaping hole open as chunks of Kirsten's meat were placed gracefully in its stomach by the hands. It chuckled and met my eyes. The chuckle was inhuman, distorted like through a broken video tape. The red bulging eyes poked my soul. It pulled the sheet back over itself as the countless arms coming from its waist and holding it up fed it more tiny pieces of Kirsten.

I turned around and slid down the door, my stomach churning and that butterfly of anxiety now a vulture eating away at me. I looked at the others, all of them had their life drained from them and were either crying or on the verge of tears. Rob curled into Gavin's arms sobbing and mumbling to himself. Lynn stared at the floor shellshocked and Ethan sat in a chair trying to find a way to turn on the security cameras.

“Ethan… the power is off…” I whimpered in my broken state.

“FUCK!” He screamed, taking a lead pipe from the corner and smashing the screen of the cameras with a crash, making us all flinch. “I-I’m… I’m sorry.” He said under his breath, his knuckles white around the pipe. I looked at him with dread. We all thought to ourselves. But I’m sure we all thought the same thing. We’re all gonna die.

Thud thud thud…

The knocks were faint, almost so quiet that no one heard it.

I scooted myself up to look. Two beautiful blue eyes met me sitting in the palm of a charred skeletal hand. I just stared. My hands jittered as I stared at the macabre mockery and heard that awful chuckle from the other side of the door. I looked away and slid back down to the ground. We all sat in silence then, unsure of what to do or say. The only sound heard was Robs shaking sobs and the thing moving around the room.

Minutes passed. Rob's crying became faint as his throat gave out. Gavin just stared at the ground while still trying to soothe Rob with an arm around him. Ethan tapped his pipe on the ground making a light clink clink clink. Our phones were all dead. All of them were charged to the max before we came but now seemed magically drained.

“The closest way out is the main exit at the end of the haunt,” Lynn whispered.

“If we run for it we could…” Ethan stopped knowing what happened when one of us ran away. He picked up a wooden board beside him with two nails sticking out and extended it to Lynn. He soon found a hammer, another pipe, and a screwdriver. I took the hammer, Gavin took the pipe, and we laid the screwdriver in Rob’s open hand.

Gavin looked up, “What if we try to sneak by?”

“I don’t know… I think that's the best Idea though…” Lynn said, thinking hard.

I held the hammer in my hand hard enough to leave marks on my palms. Still not snapped out of my trance. I kept seeing her eye writhing in agony going in circles and being soaked in a thick red coat. Would it happen to Lynn next? Or Gavin? No. I can’t let that happen. I can’t lose them. My mind was set. We were gonna make it out.

We stood circled around one of the small wooden door leading to an actor's small cubby. We removed the chair wedged under the door handle Ethan had placed quietly. We didn’t know if It was listening and waiting for us to leave so we spoke and moved with a purposefully quiet tone. Before I went Gavin grabbed my shoulder and all of our collective attention. “Don’t even breathe… no lights on.” He put his finger to his lips and led the way.

We slipped through the cramped spaces in the cubby, having to crouch and squeeze past wooden planks and leftover energy drink cans in the pitch black darkness. We climbed out into the boiler room careful as to not make a sound and crept through the darkness in front of us blindly feeling for fake brick and dirty furnaces to lead our way. Our shuffling footsteps sounded faint compared to the thumping heartbeat in my ear. My body shook as I carefully planned every footstep I took making sure not to make noise. The air was thick and the silence was deafening. Every time my jacket sleeve rubbed my arm or Ethan's foot dragged a little too loud or Rob's breath shuddered or the battery in my flashlight jittered or any slight noise anyone made I thought those dark limbs would swarm us and tear us apart.

As we walked and I stared at the floor I thought of what to do if we got out of this. Do we tell the truth? Do we not tell anyone? Do we lie and say some maniac butchered her? Do we…

A tooth fell in front of me.

Maniacal laughter fell from above us as I clicked my flashlight on. A ceiling stared down, a ceiling of smoky skin and pink bloated eyes watching us. The eyes popped like balloons filled with blood raining down on us, coating us in the thick, nearly brown blood. From the fleshy holes left by the eyes the arms descended. Ethan swung his pipe splitting one nearly in half, only a string of tendon holding it together. “RUN!”

We sprinted down the halls, the limbs swarming behind like angry wasps. I felt the hands grasp my jacket and swung around splitting one with the claw end of the hammer and crunching the other’s palm with the blunt side. Rob tripped and fell to the ground with a thud. Lynn grabbed his shoulder dragging him up as I swung at the swarm like a mad man. It wasn’t enough. The hands grasped my shoulders dragging me in. One pulled the hammer from my grasp and One grasped my jaw, its fingers going into my mouth. It tasted like molding bread and charred barbeque. I felt the boney fingertips scrape my tongue and grasp my jaw, the thumb poking into my chin hard enough to puncture the skin. I was going to die. An eye opened up staring into me with glee as its forearm prepared to twist. I closed my eyes.

I heard a “swoosh!” and liquid spray onto my face covering me. I opened my eyes to Ethan's pipe embedded in the eye and the arms losing their grip on me. I put my foot on the eye and thrust myself backwards to the ground. I scrambled to my feet rushing towards the others, the door was mere feet away. Ethan rushed and shoulder bashed into the door. I heard flesh tear like ripping a piece of duct tape and a breathy roar as the door split the meaty blockade.

We all jumped out the door into the cold wet field. A hand reached from the door grabbing the flesh coating it and ripping it into the haunt. The moonlight shone over the trees and reflected the group of eyes from its head and the oily dark teeth in its mouth smiling. The fuzzy mandibles rubbed together and the dark face retreated into the darkness with that same sinister chuckle. 

We rose to our feet sprinting to the car and dropping our weapons. Lynn cried, Ethan screamed, and Rob and Gavin just looked broken as we threw ourselves into the vehicle. I covered my face with my blood soaked hands, the blood smearing as I dragged my fingers downwards. Gavin started the car flooring it out of there and back onto the road. I don’t even remember the rest. Maybe I passed out or subconsciously blocked it but I just can’t find the memories beside flashes of mere moments.

The others tell me we went to the police where we were brought into protective custody and told them what happened. All of us told the truth. I remember that. I remember the eyes of the cops. Those eyes that said, “You’re fucking crazy.” We showered there after they took samples and our clothes for evidence. I remember the image of all that blood being washed from my body and swirling down the drain. I remember Rob's crying started again as Lynn shakily hugged me, desperate for something to remind her we escaped the nightmare. I remember the friend group then. It was broken.

A week passed. The police found Kirsten's body in the haunt and the DNA of 14 other missing people in the blood on our clothes. We were ruled out as suspects and our parents kept us home. Ethan returned to school after only a week, desperate to go back to normalcy. Gavin, Lynn, and I returned a couple days after that. We were all quiet but everyone knew what happened so no one ever dared to ask why. Despite most people in that school being jerk-offs or assholes no one bothered us. I guess they had some sympathy.

Days passed. Rob didn’t come back. I remember Lynn coming over a lot more and sobbing into my shoulder over nightmares she was having. We all had those nightmares. But in mine I saw that face. Those fuzzy mandibles, bulging red eyes, and those shit brown teeth grinding together. I just held her trying to comfort her but knowing any “It’ll all be okay,” I said was a lie. I didn’t know that. Gavin sat with me in classes. We talked about how no one believed us, how no one would ever believe us. The third week came and Rob was still gone. Was he okay? Would he ever come back?

I looked into the others eyes during lunch. “We can’t let him be alone.” I said my voice still shaky but determined. Gavin looked at me, his eyes honest and begging me to speak my mind. “We can’t split up… we can’t… I can’t do this alone. We can’t split off into our own misery from that night.” My eyes became watery. The others looked at me. Looked at me like I was water in the desert. Gavin hugged me tight, then Lynn, then Ethan. All of us tangled together in the hug. “We have to stay together.”

We knocked on Rob's door later that day. His parents let us in their eyes puffy and red from crying. We marched up the stairs to Rob’s room and decided against knocking. I slowly pushed open the door with a creak.

“I’m okay mom…” He mumbled his voice hoarse.

“Rob…” I looked at his back and gave a reluctant small smile before he turned. Rob turned tears in his eyes at seeing us. We shuffled towards him and I wrapped my arms around him. The others piled on. He cried into us. Saying it was his fault Kirsten died. He invited her. Lynn rubbed his back and Gavin cried with him. Our group would not be pulled apart by this. We wouldn’t splinter apart no matter what. We would help Rob through this, help each other through this. And for the first time in three weeks when I said, “It’ll all be okay,” I believed it.

5 years have passed since then. We kept our word and we helped each other through the trauma of that night. We’ve all grown even closer, hanging out at least once a week. Laughter has been brought back to our group. We had a DND campaign and Lynn and mine's bedroom is covered in band posters. The haunt never opened up again after that day and no one ever found that thing. I write this in that same jeep we took all those years ago parked in that very field we were in, hand in hand with Lynn, our matching rings glistening in the night. Gavin has returned from boarding up all the doors to that damn haunted house. We could smell that rancid beast inside, that smell of shit and mold. We could hear its palms slapping the floor and its labored breathing echo through the building. Ethan and Rob are stuffing rags in booze bottles. That fucking thing thinks its safe, like we did. Fire is gonna melt it down to the bone and it’s gonna be agony. Rob will be the first to light this spark. It’s going back to hell. I’m gonna imagine its eyes spinning and its vocals being suppressed by the cracking of flames and I’m gonna chuckle the same way it did. That thing couldn’t break us apart. Nothing can. That butterfly of anxiety in my chest is long dead. 

Nothing can splinter us.
