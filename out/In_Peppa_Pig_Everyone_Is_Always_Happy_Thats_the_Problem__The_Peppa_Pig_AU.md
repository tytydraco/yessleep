I used to babysit my little cousin every weekend.

She only wanted to watch *Peppa Pig*.

At first, it was harmless background noise. Bright colors. British accents. Snorting laughter. But after a while, I noticed something strange.

No matter which episode played, **nothing ever changed**.

Same house.  
Same voices.  
Same laughs, timed perfectly.

That’s normal for kids’ cartoons… until I realized something worse.

They weren’t just *repeating episodes*.

They were repeating **days**.

# The First Thing I Noticed

Peppa falls in mud puddles a lot.

Every time she does, the characters laugh — loudly, immediately, without variation. No surprise. No hesitation.

One episode, George fell in.

He didn’t laugh.

The camera lingered half a second too long.

Then Daddy Pig laughed **for him**.

>

George’s eyes were wide. Unblinking.

Then the laugh track started.

# The Second Thing

No one ever sleeps.

There are episodes that begin in the morning and end at night, but no one is ever shown going to bed.

Except once.

I swear this episode isn’t listed anywhere online.

Peppa wakes up and the house is quiet.

No music. No narrator.

She walks down the stairs and calls for her parents.

Nothing.

The walls stretch slightly longer than they should.

Then Mummy Pig appears in the kitchen, already smiling.

>

Peppa asks where Daddy Pig is.

Mummy Pig pauses.

Just long enough.

>

Cue laughter.

But Peppa doesn’t laugh.

# George Knows Something

George rarely speaks. Mostly he just says “Dinosaur.”

But in one episode, he does something different.

Peppa asks him why he keeps his dinosaur with him all the time.

George looks directly at the screen.

>

The music cuts.

Peppa blinks.

>

George doesn’t answer.

Daddy Pig walks in loudly, laughing, filling the silence.

The moment is gone.

# The Rules

The more I watched, the clearer the rules became:

• No one asks about yesterday  
• No one mentions the future  
• No one talks about leaving  
• Everyone laughs when they’re supposed to

And most importantly:

**No one cries.**

I never once saw a tear.

Until the episode that shouldn’t exist.

# The Episode Without a Title

There was no intro.

No theme song.

Just Peppa standing alone in the yard.

The sky was the wrong color — a dull gray instead of blue.

She jumps in a muddy puddle.

No laughter.

She jumps again.

Still nothing.

Peppa looks confused.

Then scared.

She starts laughing by herself.

Too loud. Too forced.

>

Her voice cracks.

The camera zooms out.

The town is empty.

Houses with doors open.

No people.

No sounds.

Then the narrator speaks — but not cheerfully.

>

Peppa looks up.

>

Silence.

Then every character appears at once, standing too close together, all smiling.

Daddy Pig’s smile stretches too far.

Mummy Pig doesn’t blink.

Madame Gazelle steps forward.

>

Peppa screams.

The screen cuts to the theme song.

Bright. Cheerful. Normal.

# Why I Stopped Watching

After that day, my cousin didn’t want Peppa Pig anymore.

I asked her why.

She said:

>

That night, I dreamed of muddy puddles filling my room.

And laughter.

Endless, looping laughter.

When I woke up, my phone was open.

Paused on a Peppa Pig episode.

At the very beginning.

Everyone smiling.

Like nothing ever happened.
