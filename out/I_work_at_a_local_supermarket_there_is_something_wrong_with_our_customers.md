Hey r/nosleep  
Posting this from the breakroom at my workplace, just call me Nate (technically Nate Jr., blame my Mum), it's around 6:30pm, probably 8pm when I'll post this, I guess it's a whole run of random thoughts for me, so things will be a bit disjointed.

To start with, I am (as of now) the ADM (Assistant Department Manager) of the Front End of Willy's Wonderstore, a local branch of supermarkets in my homestate of Queensland. (Yes, I'm Aussie.)  
Used to work for the bigger chains when I was around 14, quickly realised all the big claims of "Family" were manipulative tactics by the time I had my first drink at 16. (Best night of my life, if I'm honest, gotta miss the days of high school sometimes... even if my friends and I broke the law.)  
Shortly after that, I was without a job, home was a mess, mum couldn't handle all the stress alone, sending me to school and working a 7 day job, so I had to find a new job for myself, real quick, without the issue of corporate manipulation looming over my shoulder.

That's where Willy's Wonderstore came in, it was a local brand, reputable, small. Living in a low income house with my widowed mum, I of course jumped at the chance to work for them, skip forward a whole 7 years and I'm a scruffy 23yr old employee who still hasn't climbed the corporate ladder. Pay's good, mum was able to quit her shitty job, since I was able to pay off the debts she'd racked up after dad left us and this world.

Only reason I explain this, is so that you know why I can't just hand in my two weeks and quit.

But that's enough of me, I should explain why I am posting this and asking for your advice and help. I started my ADM position about 2 months back, around the time our PDM Rebbeca was in her third trimester and forced to go on maternity leave. Woman had to be told by the store managed to go on leave, or he'd fire her, she loved the Front End, meeting people, but I could not imagine the strain she must have been in, hence why she was forced to take time off.

So, with her being put on limited time and me being added as her second in command, I was trained and then given the expectation to take over from her for the time she's gone (I doubt it's a short time, her husband was an amputee, real bad car crash, so he was wheelchair bound. Great guy though, killer stories about his time in the air force. So taking care of a baby is gonna run them both ragged), which included doing one of the strangest tasks you could think a check-out worker would have to do- opening and closing the store at night.

Willy's operates on a more lax schedule, we open at 10am sharp, every morning, close at 6pm, regardless of weekday or weekend (on holidays we stay open until 9pm.). But then, we open back up at 11pm until 4am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Manager calls it 'Graveyard Trading Hours', payrates are doubled and it's a pretty sweet deal. At least, that's what I was thinking, at first.

Part of Rebbeca's duties was starting at 12pm and at the end of the shift, having us close up at 6pm and then returning at 11pm to open up again, with the now ex ADM, Kyle, closing at 4am. Only reason she was needed was to verify headcount, so that no one was trying to pretend to be a member of staff, or sneak in a shift on the rather gullible shift system for a quick and easy buck at double the rate.

Me, though, I fulfil both their roles, I arrive at work at 11:50am sharp and then clock in at 11:54am. I just find the early start helps me figure out what the day is going to be like, what stock is on hand, the usual.

I work on front end, keep the staff members in line, sell liquor and other 18+ stuff to the occasional customer, usually met with grunts and growls about the need for ID, the average crap that you get being on the main counter. After that, around closing time (5:30pm), we take out the trash from any of the registers, if you work in retail, you know the drill, send one of the juniors off with the trash bags to chuck them into the dumpster out back near the loading bay.

Then, I take my copy of the store keys and bring down the roller doors, leaving only the one next to the express register open so the nightfill team can herd any confused customers out (usually the elderly who can't really tell the time while in a grocery store) through it. Once all the customers are gone, I close the last roller door, say goodnight to the nightfill ADM, Sarah and let the Front End team out through the exit door on the dock. By the end of that, it is usually 6:10pm, then I have to perform a 20 minute double take on our store's security footage, for anything that comes up on the security cameras. (They have a program on them that puts a highlight on anything that does not line up at the Front End.)

Trawling through hazy freezeframes, I have to label them under different categories, whether they are considered to be of concern, a scan that didn't go through or even shoplifting an item. Half the time it's just the camera bugging out because someone bought something from somewhere else and has it in their trolley.

By 6:30pm, I save all the categories into a folder for the Store Manager, David, to look through when he opens in the morning at 10am. I then stay back until 7pm, having to check through my team's statistics (contract hours, any duty limitations, workplace notices on behaviour.)

Now, due to my task as ADM, on any of the days we don't have the bizarre night trading hours, it's just a simple 7hr shift, I come in just before 12, finish at 7 and go home to my mum and our black cat, Coal.  
But for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the schedule changes, come in early, keep the team in check, work until 6, then close the roller doors and let the team out. But instead of staying back, I myself have to leave at 6pm too, as I am expected to return in 5hrs to reopen the store.

What I do, on those nights, is that I will head home (a good 25 minute walk to our quaint family home) and take a 3hr power nap, usually with Coal laying his plump, fuzzy mass on top of my neck like a scarf. Mum then will wake me up, as she is about to go to bed, usually scooping up the pudgy black cat as she goes and I will take a quick hot shower and swap my work hat and shirt, to feel fresh. Then I walk back to work, usually grabbing a small bite to eat on the way from one of the local fast food places on the route to Willy's.

By the time I am back at Willy's Wonderstore, the nightfill team will be packing up and heading home, with Sarah and I inverting our farewell, where I wave goodbye to her, instead of her doing so. I will note that I am not alone, during this time, as I am accompanied by team members from what David calls "The Graveyard Shift", they don't talk much, mostly keep to themselves and seem to focus solely on scanning items, droning out responses and packing bags. I can understand the feeling, though, they are having to do night shift and check-out work, it's not too fun to combine too rather dreary tasks into one.

The customers we get at night aren't the worst, as we live in a decently small country town, mostly stoners, angsty teens, stressed out college kids and the rare nutcase that come through. Once we get near 4am, I then do the usual closing up procedure, roller doors, trash and footage, along with reports.

What I could not understand, though, is that the cameras would sometimes affix on random customers the other staff serve, usually focussing on the oddest of spots, like the neck flab of a man in a mobility scooter, or the broken arm of a wannabe punk artist. As I've said, the footage is hazy, so I don't understand why the cameras do it, meaning that I have to write those off as simple irrelevancy.

But, besides the bizarre customers and dreary co-workers, the late night trade pays well and goes by quickly. At least, it used to be, until last Monday.

Last Monday marked the start of it getting cold over here, real cold... Fog, cold dribbles of rain, dry winds and the usual prelude to winter. It also marked the night shift getting a lot less breezy.

I entered through the back, being waved at by Sarah as I turned left into the stockroom and walked past the shelves of overstocked items, heading for the staff breakroom and offices just on the other side. I'd gotten a chicken burger meal on the way, it was steaming hot, so I was a bit slower than my usual brisk pace, especially being rugged up in at least three layers. What was especially different was that after waving, I heard Sarah call to me. I looked back, seeing that she had been trying to wave me over, rather than wave goodbye.

Turning on my heels, I headed back to her, she looked a bit spooked, I then noticed her team had headed home early, from the looks of it, the night's load still had at least 2 pallets remaining (they were T3s, for anyone that is interested, soft drink and energy drinks.). I can clearly remember how our exchange went, as usually I was the one to get a conversation started, but this time, Sarah spoke first:

'Nate, I'm gonna be staying back tonight for a bit, alright? Apparently some weirdo was lingering at the roller doors, staring at team members. I'll be clocked off, but I want you to keep your earpiece on you.'

I shrugged, but then nodded.

'Alright, you want me to tell the other team members to keep an eye out?'

She seemed to flinch when I mentioned the team, which caused me to frown, why was she wanting me to keep information about a possible person that needed blacklisting from my team?

'No, I don't think that'd be best, it's just... a hunch, I guess.'

'You're not one for hunches, though.'

I'd known Sarah since I started at the store, her and I were part of the same hiring pool, started same day, we'd built a decent work friendship, it was unlike her to act this way, more to keep anything to herself when it came to her thoughts.

'I can't say... just follow me.'

Sarah didn't budge, instead deciding to drag me off like a lost child to the communications office.

At our work place, there are two offices, David's Office, where meetings are held and paperwork is kept, then there is the Communications Office, where we store two outdated PCs, our singular printer and the charging dock for our walkies and earpieces, it is also where you have to clock in on the computer, entering payroll number and your personalised password. Both offices are the only rooms in the staff only area that have locks besides the back door and loading bay roller door.

Sarah handed me an earpiece, the mess of wires having to be untangled in my one free hand so the power source could clip onto my belt and the tiny audio receiver could clip to my work shirt's breast pocket. The earpiece itself looping around my ear and the speaker dangling just above the eardrum.

'Listen, I just need you to be my eyes and ears out there, alright? I can do the reports and footage for you, as long as you let me stay in the main office. Don't let the others know I'm here.'

Sarah definitely was acting strange, evasive, without a moment for me to even ask what the hell she was on about, the lock clicked on the door to David's office, leaving me alone for the next five minutes.

Usually, if I had the time, I'd have looked at what we had stored in the overstock shelves, but the now lukewarm burger beckoned to me, as I felt my body yearn for some sustenance. I obliged it and quickly stored away my clothing in my work locker, still keeping at least a jacket and scarf on me, having to fiddle with my name badge to get it to click onto my jacket instead of my shirt. As I stepped out of the men's locker room, I then heard the far off noise of my co-workers cars pulling into the parking spaces.

Sarah was silent on the communication channel, even as I did a headcount on the mopey crew I called my teammates, though I could have sworn one looked slightly confused at me. If they had tried to speak, though, it seems they didn't see the point in bothering.

All went normal, or as normal as serving the odd and zany could be. It was around 1am that I heard Sarah on the earpiece, seems she had gone over to the communications office once the other team members had clocked in, I could hear the whirring of the overtaxed fan within one of the PCs on her end.

'Register 3, man in a mobility scooter, back of his neck.'

It was a surprise to hear her, but I made sure to show little sign of reacting, hiding the surprise with the realisation that I had not refilled the drink fridges on the registers, something that gave me an excuse to go past Register 3.

Registers 1 and 2 had fully stocked beverages, but 3 had been decently emptied, a good amount of traffic having passed through, the current customer being served was a rather obese man on a mobility scooter. I didn't judge people's weight, but internally, I did feel sorry for how his joints must be, at least, until I caught sight of the back of his neck, right at the nape. I didn't understand what I saw, at least, not immediately.

'What do you see?'

Sarah asked, I didn't respond, I averted my gaze and placed the drinks in according order. Though I think the customer noticed, as a rumbling voice came to my attention, a thick lisp to his voice.

'Excoose me, do you hath sum shashparella?'

I looked down to the crate of drinks in my hands, I did indeed, so I handed one to him, but he seemed disappointed.

'Maw pweash'

I offered the crate and he beamed like a child on Christmas day. He took all of them, which, in my honest opinion, was financially wasteful, a 350ml bottle of sars from us runs you $3.50 per bottle, he had taken at least 23 of them, minus the one I had put on the shelf of the drink fridge. The server shot a death stare at me, as she had to put more items in more bags for her customer, but the customer himself was quite happy, he turned back, nestling back into his scooter.

The first time I saw it, I didn't understand, but now... now I saw that what were at first glance rolls of skin, were in fact lips, pale, but with the occasional, thick tongue poking out to lick and slather the area with drool. I went stiff, as I turned and walked.

I wish I was someone who experienced fear like the typical person, but whenever I get scared, I get stiff and cold, the polar opposite to an adrenaline rush. Luckily, though, it seemed no one noticed. The store was otherwise quiet, not even a minute after what had happened at Register 3, I clocked off for a 15 minute break.

Getting to the breakroom was a blessing, it was warm, ten times better than the shop floor, but even better was being able to lock myself in the Communications Office with Sarah, after I gave her a quick message on the comms channel.

'I saw it, let me in.'

The Communications Office was really warm, the PCs had been warming up a lot, and Sarah was looking expectantly at me.

'Well?'

She leaned against the dirty white plastic case of the printer.

'Well... the man had...'

Sarah stared expectantly at me, I felt like I was being pranked.

'This is a prank, isn't it?'

I decided to ask, Sarah looked offended, then concerned.

'Nathan, this is not a prank, tell me, now.'

I was unsure, I doubted her, but I answered honestly.

'I don't know... lips? And tongues?'

Sarah stared through me, as if I wasn't there, then she turned to the PC, pointing at multiple reports from prior nights I had worked as Front End Manager on. There that same man in the mobility scooter was, each time, the cameras pointed to his neck.

'I still don't know what this has to do with that mentioned weirdo.'

She didn't respond, instead just pulling up a grainy and dark image, from much earlier, during her shift, same body shape, but not sitting on his scooted... rather, he was standing on what almost looked like a blob of flesh, like a slug.

I shook my head.

'It's too late for this... he's probably some weirdo looking to freak people out with practical effects, some people do that.'

I didn't believe myself, I wanted to, but there was no way that what I saw could make sense in any way but the supernatural.

'Well, how about this, you get no other weird customer until 3am, I leave. Sound good?'

Sarah gave a decent ultimatum, it was about 1:36am, at that time, I'd be back on the floor at 1:45am. I nodded and then exited the office. I heard her relock it behind me.

I had a poor quality cup of instant noodles, before I got back onto the floor, heading back to my spot of work, the main counter.

Any activity in the store had crawled to a snail's pace, only got one customer through, a confused driver asking for directions, as we were the only place open in the centre of town. He was nice enough, came along to visit his Grandpa in the nearby town.

It was at 2:55am that it came into the store.

On first glance, you would think it was the average drug addict, scraggly hair, wrinkled skin, rotted teeth, attitude to match. But it was when it came to my register that I found it to be anything but. It looked like a woman, probably late 50s, a bit younger than my own mum, but without any of the graceful aging she had been granted.

'Twenty ciggies now. My uuuuuusual.'

I'm used to customers being rude or impatient, but I had no clue on what their usual meant, so I responded as would be expected.

'Sorry? What type do you take?'

It's bony fingers tensed into balled fists as it smacked the counter, screaming like a banshee.

'THE BLUE ONES!!!'

I froze, to it, I stood still and stared back, but internally, I was assessing the threat they posed. If they jumped the counter, I had good chances of escaping, due to how high it is, if they tried to punch me from there, I could move back. So, I took a breath in and tried to deescalate the situation.

'Ma'am, I need a brand name, please, there's no need to get aggressive.'

It shook, then, to my silent and unflinching horror, mashed it's face into the counter. I heard something crack, then something rip, but not in the way you'd expect meat to, but instead how rubber would.

'I... I just want some Earls Blues, darling.'

Its neck had bent like a rubber hose, craning to the side at a sharp 180 degree turn, their face was contorted and flattened by the impact, like a clay sculpture being pressed down while still wet. I now could also tell that the skin had a leathery texture to it, with a rather grey tone, utterly inhuman.

I was terrified, but I did as it asked, grabbed the brand it wanted, was handed a pair of $50 bills, they didn't even stay for me giving them the change, instead giggling like a lunatic as they hopped out the exit of the store with the cigarette carton cupped in their hands. When all went quiet, I looked to the registers, none of my co-workers had looked up.

The rest of the night went by slowly, at least, until the trash run came. This time, I chose to take the trash myself, letting my dour co-workers shuffle off to the back room to restock the snacks section of their registers.

I hadn't heard from Sarah until I went to do the trash run, she probably saw me doing the preparations.

'Meet you at the dock, act like I came in to check in.'

I've never been one to waste time, but I spent a solid 10 minutes outside, in silence, with Sarah keeping to the shadow cast by the dumpster. I had thrown the bags in, but I just needed to be near an actual human, after what I had seen.

'I saw what happened.'

I didn't respond. She knew that my reaction to trauma, fear and tension was to internalise it and to freeze up.

'I'll give you a lift home, would your old lady lets me crash on the couch?'

I nodded. Had been since I was 15 that I had someone sleep over, but I think her and I were both too spooked to want to venture into the night alone. But we didn't have enough time to be talking, so I swallowed my fear and headed back inside, with Sarah in tow.

Closing up procedure went easily, but the co-workers stared at Sarah, despite her given reason, that she was doing the last two pallets before the morning load came in. I had to actively yell at one to move from his station, to which he grunted and turned away. I got a worrying hunch that I was best to keep Sarah and the Graveyard Shift separate.

Finally, it was home time, the Graveyard Shift filtered out and it was just me and Sarah. Filing reports and finishing up the pallets was easy enough, she gave me a spare box cutter so I could actually break the tape. I also learnt how to unload a cardboard bailer, it was pretty fun.

After all the clean up, it was 4:23am, everything was filed away and tidied up. Not the best end time, but for a night where the night fill team was lacking some people, we made good progress.

It was as Sarah and I headed for her ute that I witnessed something that I wish I had not seen. It was the entity that had verbally assaulted me and broke its neck earlier, rummaging through the dumpster. For a brief moment, I caught it's gaze, as it munched on receipt papers as if it was a horse eating grass. It had too many teeth, but I saw that it smiled.

The drive back home was uneventful, thankfully, but I did notice that Sarah kept looking back to me, worried, as if I was going to just vanish.

When we got home, I accidentally woke mum up, Coal was still fast asleep, but at least Sarah was welcomed to stay the night, she didn't have work the following work day. She was set up next to the fire place and given a bunch of blankets, alongside the three person couch, safe to say, I was jealous, seemed extra cosy compared to my own room.

Getting to sleep was hard, practically impossible, before I knew it, it was 8am and Coal was scratching at my door for his morning snuggles. I got two hours of sleep, thanks to the affectionate blob of fur that is that cat, I think Mum and Sarah got chatting in the meantime.

By the time I was up, it was 10:25am and I had work in an hour and a half. Sadly meaning I could not hang around for long, having to dose myself with as much coffee as I could handle and treat myself to a quick hot shower before throwing on the work gear I had worn just the night prior. I didn't feel like ironing it, not after the night prior.

Today went by with no issue, luckily it was Tuesday, so Kyle was doing the promo ends, meaning Front End got some fancy new magazines to advertise to customers. It also means I don't need to stay back. But when it came to closing time, I decided to do a quick lap of the store.

I came up empty handed, half expected my curiosity to be rewarded with the cigarette obsessed thing running at me from around the corner like a possessed maniac. Instead, I just found sleepy pigeons huddling in the old vents for warmth and a single homeless man, who I gave $5, as he usually busks during the day inside the shopping centre our store is attached to.

Now I'm here, wasting away unpaid time, typing this all down. I checked the clock and realised it's almost 9pm. I'll have to get going, keep getting the occasional weird look from members of night fill for staying back so late to type this down on one of the computers.

Sarah is going to pick me up, I think it's going to be safer that way, at least, at night.  
I've had to tell her a couple times that I will be late and she should just wait for me to call, so best for me to finish this. I think Kyle especially is annoyed, but he left at 4pm, after setting up the ends, he's now the Grocery ADM, not sure what by, though. I should probably ask him for advice, shouldn't I? But can I trust him to believe that I saw some sort of slug man and a rubbery psycho junkie?

I'll put an end to this post now, but please, give me advice on how I can deal with any of this, if you believe me. I feel like I'm up a creek without a paddle.

I'm also up to answering questions, if you're curious about anything, maybe they will lead to answers too.

Thank you all for reading, Nate signing off.

PS. If anything happens on Wednesday night, I am going to post it as soon as I can.
