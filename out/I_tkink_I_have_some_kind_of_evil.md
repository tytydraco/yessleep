I think I am some kind of evil

When I finally became financially independent from my parents, I decided to move out of their house. So I rented an apartment and I was really excited. Until one night, when I was sleeping, and until that moment, I didn't have that much money, so I slept with the door open. 

My apartment has a hallway, in front of my bedroom, and one normal night, I started to dream... first I dreamed of my apartment being completely dark, but with some natural lights, it seemed like it was night and the moonlight illuminated every part of it, and in this apartment there was a big window in the living room, really big, and it looked like a lot of people were walking outside, as if they were on the sidewalk, which was very strange, because I lived on the 3rd floor. 

They were very strange, and they were just walking, but there was a man, dressed all in black, with a black hood and I couldn't see his face, just the feeling that he was watching me. 

The last time I had this feeling, I was 5 years old, and I also saw a man standing in the doorway of my room, with a black hoodie, watching me.

All around my hallway there were lots of strange little statues, and I was scared to death, so I started running to my room and kicking all these scary statues while praying hard! I closed my bedroom door and tried to sleep. Then I woke up again and my bedroom door was open. And I couldn't move.

Then I saw it. I saw myself. And what I saw was crawling towards me. Slowly. With white eyes. Smiling at me. And I couldn't say anything. The only word I could say was: Jesus. I called Jesus so many times.

And the other me disappeared, when I woke up it was morning, and I don't know if that was just a dream, or it really happened. Don't sleep with the bedroom door open. Never. God bless you.
