Learning about the existence of the NoSleep community has given me the courage to tell this story for the first time in 35 years. Only two other people besides myself know about it, and as will become clear, there’s likely nothing in the way of physical evidence to back up my story. But this community seems to be a place where people are given the benefit of the doubt, so I’m going to describe it in as much detail as I can. I apologize if my story goes on some tangents. I will probably remember more details here and there during the writing process. Also, I am going to do my best to recreate conversations as best I can, but I can’t promise they are word-for-word accurate. Also, naturally I am changing all of the names of the real people involved.

I was in the fourth grade in 1989. I was a pretty normal kid, but a little on the nerdy side. I was into all the things boys that age enjoyed back then– Nintendo, Transformers and Ninja Turtles. During summer vacation, I had water gun fights with other kids in our neighborhood (we dramatically called them “Water Wars”) and used chalk to draw a four-square court to play in our neighbor’s driveway. At night I played board games with my dad, and on Fridays we would go and rent a movie from our local movie rental store.

For two particular summers in a row, I spent several hours a day in an empty nightclub called “Vibes” (I know… it was the 80s). The reason was because my mother and two business partners had started a delivery-only deli in the heart of downtown. They delivered sandwiches and subs to employees of nearby businesses, usually employing five or six college-age kids to work in the kitchen and deliver the food by bike. Being a delivery-only deli, they didn’t need a dining area, so they worked out a deal to rent the kitchen of the nightclub during the daytime, when it would otherwise go unused. 

Since my mother wasn’t comfortable leaving me alone in our house all day, she used to take me to the nightclub while she was at work, and it was actually pretty fun. I would usually pick a table in one of the seating areas surrounding the vacant dance floor and stage, then I’d pass the time drawing, reading comics and listening to music. I got to have a sandwich of my choice from the deli for lunch each day.

The only real downside of spending that much time at the nightclub was the occasional sense of loneliness and isolation. There was nowhere to hang out in the kitchen, and since the only people there were a bunch of adults hurrying around cooking and making deliveries, I was really left to entertain myself in the rest of this somewhat maze-like two-story structure. One time I ran into the owner, Vince. He owned several properties so he wasn’t at the club much, but he told me I could hang out anywhere I wanted as long as I turned the lights off when I wasn’t in a particular room.

Exploring the dark and empty nightclub could be fun. I mostly had free reign of the place, save for a few doors that were always locked. There was one place in particular though, that I found to be pretty creepy. There were three different access points from the first floor to the second. One was a staircase near the kitchen, and another was just off the dance floor and led to a balcony seating area overlooking the stage. Those two staircases formed a loop that ran through the bar on the second floor, and the whole area was pretty well lit because it was near windows that let the natural light in all day long.

As for the third staircase, it took about a month for me to find it. Being a somewhat timid kid, I had to work up the courage to go into the darker areas that were farther away from the kitchen where my mother was working, but once I did, I found the third stairwell. I could only access it from the top floor, because the door at the bottom was locked shut. So it was essentially a dead end. Thinking about it now, I imagine it must have been a back exit where people could leave the club without going back through what was surely a crowded dance floor and seating area. 

I only went into this third stairwell a couple of times, because it immediately creeped me out when I first discovered it. I couldn’t find a light switch anywhere, so it was lit only by a single fire exit sign and two dim, pink lights installed in the ceiling that were always left on. The staircase was positioned against a large, windowless wall that had a painting on it. The painting was a stylized, black-and-white depiction of a man in a trench coat with an old-fashioned machine gun, except the man had no head. There was just a big, black hole where the neck should have emerged out of the top of the tightly buttoned coat. 

The first time I discovered the picture, I imagined it must have been intended as an edgy piece of modern art that contributed to the image of the nightclub. Even as a kid, I understood that the owner would want the club to have a cool atmosphere to be appealing to adults. Still, being only nine years old, I couldn’t look at the headless figure for more than a few seconds before the hair on the back of my neck started to stand on end.

After the initial discovery, I mostly avoided that stairwell. I poked my head inside once or twice to get another glimpse at the bizarre drawing on the wall, but that was it. It wasn’t until the second summer that I ventured all the way in again. The only reason I did was because one of my mother’s business partners began to occasionally bring his kids to the nightclub during the day too. I imagine their family situation may have changed and he occasionally couldn’t find a babysitter or something. His kids were both girls– Jamie and Chelsea– and they were one and two years younger than me respectively. 

At first, we didn’t get along well. I was used to having the place to myself, and the things I liked to do at the club were solitary activities. I got annoyed when they ran around the place shouting, something I had never been inclined to do. Unlike me they didn’t seem like the kind of kids who could entertain themselves very easily without being obnoxious about it.

Still, I tried to extend an olive branch every so often. I would let Chelsea use some of my art supplies to draw, or play a game of pool at the billiards tables that were one room over from the dance floor. A little while after they started coming to the nightclub, I asked them if they had explored the upstairs or any of the more remote places.

“Dad told us we shouldn’t do that,” Jamie said.

“Really? My mom doesn’t care,” I replied. “Vince even told me I could go wherever I wanted as long as I turned the lights off when I left.”

Jamie and Chelsea didn’t seem like particularly obedient kids to begin with, so it didn’t take a lot of convincing for them to let me show them around the deeper, darker recesses of the nightclub. There were a couple of uninteresting back halls that led from the kitchen to an office, a corridor to the bathrooms, and so on. I showed them the upstairs bar, which they immediately didn’t like because it reeked of cigarette smoke (I couldn’t say I blamed them).

Naturally I saved the most interesting part of the tour for last. “Have you guys seen the mural in the stairwell?” I asked. They shook their heads. So we headed upstairs so they could get a look. As usual, it was lit by two pink lights, but I immediately noticed that the “EXIT” sign was no longer illuminated this time, making it even dimmer than before. I didn’t think much of it, because I was much more fixated on seeing Jamie and Chelsea’s reaction to the picture.

Jamie seemed to brush it off immediately. She came across as the type of kid who wasn’t easy to impress and got bored easily. She wandered down the stairs to the small landing and around the corner to the short hall that ended at the locked door. Chelsea had the opposite reaction. As soon as I showed her the picture, she practically froze halfway down the stairwell, absolutely transfixed by it.

“It’s pretty weird, right?” I asked. She didn’t even respond. She just stared up at the headless gangster. I imagined she felt a little like I did the first time I saw it, so I said, “I’m sure it’s just something they put up to look ‘cool,’ you know?” Still no response. 

Finally, she said, as her voice broke a little bit, “I’ve seen him before.”

I was confused. “What, you mean the same picture?”

“No, I saw this man.”

I started to think maybe it hadn’t been a good idea to show them the mural. Chelsea was two years younger than me, after all, so if it creeped me out, I imagine it must have been even scarier for her.

I was about to suggest that we head back up and out into the seating area, when there was a loud clang. The door at the top of the stairs had slammed shut violently. 

“What the hell?” I heard Jamie say from around the corner from the bottom of the stairwell. I stood frozen for a minute and made eye contact with Chelsea– she was clearly terrified. I mustered up the courage to climb back up the stairs and open the door, but when I wrapped my hand around the doorknob, I realized it was locked.

Almost on cue, I heard Jamie ask, “Hey, are we locked in?” 

“Yeah,” I said softly, still staring at the door. What could have possibly made it slam shut so fast? Was one of the deli employees playing a prank on us? Was Vince at the club that day? Did he close it?

It was only at that moment that it occurred to me just how far away we were from our parents in this part of the nightclub. With the radio and the shuffling and clanging noises of the kitchen, I doubted they would hear us even if we started shouting at the top of our lungs. I had no idea how long it would take for one of the adults to notice they hadn’t seen us in a while and come looking for us.

My mind was racing as I tried to figure out what to do. I turned around to face Chelsea again, only to see that she had resumed staring at the picture on the wall. She had the same mesmerized look on her face as she did moments ago, before the door slammed shut, as though there had been no interruption.

“Hey, come look at this,” I heard Jamie say. She was still down the stairs and around the corner, out of my line of sight. It didn’t sound like she was worried too much about being locked in. I ventured the rest of the way down the stairs, squeezing past the still-immobilized Chelsea, and rounded the corner.

Jamie was pointing at the wall under the stairwell. I quickly realized that there was another door that I hadn’t noticed before, but not a full-size door. It was a cubby-sized door to what was presumably a storage area underneath the stairs. But Jamie wasn’t just pointing at the door itself. As I got closer, in this most dimly lit corner of the room, I saw three dark marks on the door. I leaned in further so that my head was level with Jamie’s pointing finger and squinted to make out the images.

There in the center of this door were three smaller-sized versions of the exact same headless trench coat man that was painted on the stairwell.

Being a little bolder than me, Jamie tapped on the door. The noise it made was surprising. It's hard to explain, but it seemed to give off an echo, some kind of spatial indication of whatever area was behind it. And I could tell that it sounded a LOT bigger than a little closet. It sounded like it was actually extending downward.

Jamie reached down to the small doorknob on the door and turned it, but it was locked shut. At the exact moment she twisted the knob in vain, we heard a click from up the stairs. I stood up and looked around the corner, and sure enough, the upstairs door had opened. It was only open a crack, as if someone had merely turned the key in the doorknob and let it slide open on its own.

“Hey, who opened the door?” I asked Chelsea. This finally snapped her out of her gaze at the mural and she jerked her head in my direction in an almost robotic motion. She said nothing.

“Chelsea, what the hell is the matter with you?” Jamie said, coming up behind me. “Who opened the door!?” Chelsea then looked up at the open door. Her body seemed to relax, like she was coming out of a trance. 

“I dunno,” she finally answered.

At this point, I was DONE. I pushed past both of the girls and up to the top of the stairs, flatly muttering, “Come on.”

I opened the door and we emerged back into the nightclub’s upstairs seating area. I closed the door behind us. There was some rustling down below, and I peered over the balcony to see Vince kneeling down on the dance floor with a few boxes. He looked up to face us before I could say anything.

“Oh hey, guys,” he said in a somewhat somber tone.

“Hey, Vince, was that you at the door up here just now?” I asked.

“Oh yeah,” he said as he lowered his gaze and went back to sifting through the boxes. “Sorry, were you guys in there?”

“Yeah,” I replied, starting to feel a little more relaxed that this all had a simple explanation. What didn’t occur to me at the time, though, was that it made no sense for Vince to SLAM the door shut, then gently ease it open a few minutes later, for no apparent reason, especially if he didn’t realize we were in there as he claimed.

“What’s with the boxes?” Jamie asked Vince, apparently having already dismissed the entire incident.

“Startin’ the big clean-out,” Vince answered as we descended the stairs to the dance floor. “Got about six more weeks to pack up.”

Jamie must have noticed a confused look on my face, because after a pause she said, “Wait, your mom told you, right?”

“Told me what?” I said.

Vince interjected, “We’re clearin’ outta here. By October this building’s gonna be a pile a’ rubble.” He looked up at me again and could tell I had no clue what he was talking about. “For the new courthouse.”

Later that night I would learn that Vibes, along with several other buildings on the same block, were about to be demolished so that the city could build a new courthouse. It had been in the works for years, and my mother had known about it for several months. When I asked, she said that the reason she hadn’t told me yet was because she knew I loved hanging out in the nightclub, and that she wasn’t even sure if the deli was going to survive once the building closed. They would have to find somewhere that they could operate out of for roughly the same rent, since they were just barely breaking even.

“Hey, that reminds me,” Vince continued, “Can you guys do me a favor and not go in any of the doors that are usually locked around here if you see them open?”

We all nodded obediently.

“Thanks. I got a lotta crap to clear out of this place and I’m gonna be cleaning out these old storage areas that I’ve barely set foot in since I bought the building.”

We started to walk back to the pool area near the kitchen when my thoughts drifted back to what had just happened. I approached Vince from behind as he continued to sift through junk in the trio of boxes he’d laid out.

“Hey, um… do you know why there are little drawings of that big drawing in the staircase over there?” I asked, not really sure what I was hoping to learn. It just seemed like the question had to be asked.

“Oh, you mean the Tommy Gun Man?” Vince replied.

“Uh, yeah. That’s what he’s called?”

“Yeah, Tommy Gun Mannnn…” Vince trailed off, almost as if just saying the name somehow sapped him of energy. He stopped what he was doing and paused, then turned and looked up at me. “What are you talkin’ about, little drawings?”

“Well–” I started, but suddenly something stopped me from explaining my question. Maybe Vince was beginning to look annoyed that we were bothering him, or maybe the whole experience was just fading quickly enough that it no longer seemed important. So there were a few little drawings on the wall of a nightclub. Big deal, right?

Before I could say anything else, Vince interjected, “Hey, that reminds me, you kids should probably stay off those stairs anyway. It’s kinda dangerous down there, not well lit.”

“Okay.” I nodded and turned to leave again.

“Besides,” Vince said, “You don’t wanna go pissin’ off old Tommy Gunnnn Mannnn…”

That was the beginning of the end for the Vibes nightclub, and the events that took place over the next few weeks have stayed with me for over three decades. I’m happy to have the chance to share some of them now, and will post again soon.

Lastly, [I found an image of the Vibes nightclub from 1989.](https://imgur.com/a/ntTUas9) I would also like to take a crack at drawing Tommy Gun Man and a map of the interior of the nightclub, if people are interested to see it.
