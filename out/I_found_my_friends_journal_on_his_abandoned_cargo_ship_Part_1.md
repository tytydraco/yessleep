**When I first started doing freelance journalism Terry and I agreed that if anything interesting ever happened to him I got to report it first.** 

**“Eric, if I kick the can in a fantastic way, I’ll put it in my will that if anyone reports on it before you that my family will sue their ass. ” I remember him saying. (I doubt that’ll hold up in court though, but it's the thought that counts.)** 

**So when the Cargo ship he worked on was discovered deserted I knew it was time to take him up on his promise.**

**When the rescue team let it slip that they discovered a detailed journal in his bunk I did what any self respecting journalist would do and harassed them and the coast guard for several months until I finally got my hands on a copy.** 

**Terry was a great friend, even though after college we drifted apart I will always love him and cherish our time together. When I heard he’d started going to school to become a cargo ship deck officer I wasn’t overly surprised, he was always the kid in class coming in every month with a different broken bone and a hell of a story.** 

**He had talked about his love for travel and adventure so much it only seemed like the perfect fit for him. I remember him telling me that all he wants in life is to be remembered, moralized in some way even if it is just in the memory of his loved ones.** 

**In the spirit of him being remembered I have transcribed the entirety of his journal below. I not only do this to honor my friend, but because if what he describes in this journal is true? the world needs to know.** 

Feb 22nd, 2024.

 

They stuck the newbie with the early morning and midnight rotation. I can’t say they didn’t warn me when I was doing my practicum with APM. 

“I’m not doing that shit, get the rookie to do it” Carlos told the pilot Benjamin.

What Carlos lacks in subtlety he makes up for in knowledge and work ethic. He had been used to AB life for 2 decades. No one knows his age, I guessed mid 50s but everytime someone asks he gives a different answer, when I asked he told me he was 15.

“Not my problem, talk to the new Master, I’m sure hearing your bitching is the first impression he needs.” Benjamin responded.

Ben was a lanky white dude that wouldn’t look out of place drinking gluten free beer at an indie rock concert. He’s the closest to me in age, only being 2 years older than me, and honestly even though he looks kinda like a douche I he’s one of the better guys to talk to.

“Have any of you guys met the new master yet?” I asked.

“Nope.” Carlos responded, pouring his second coffee of the day. 

“Don’t even know his name, they don’t tell us shit.” Ben added clicking the mouse on the control panel. 

There’s about 20 guys on staff on the ship, most of them old timers like Carlos, only one rookie besides me. Sam, he graduated the same year I did and from all I could gather in the 30 second conversation we had in line at the mess hall isn’t much for talking. 

Not rude by any means, just keeps to himself. I think he chose this job to get away from people, can’t blame him. I guess we all have our specific reasons for being here. 

After a while more of chatting shit and dodging Carlos’s putrid smelling hug of gratitude after I agreed to switch to the night watch for him. The new master walked in. Of course everyone is new to me but when he walked in I felt oddly better, like I wasn’t the odd man out anymore and that the old timers and I had something we could both agree on. That being the new master looked like a complete ass. 

He was a tall skinny guy with oddly broad shoulders, his buzz cut seemingly keeping his head from exploding from its own inflated sense of self. 

He wore a spotless white pilots jacket with long black trousers and carried his pilot's hat in his hand. 

Ben and Carlos immediately shot each other looks, waiting for the other person to break out into laughter. The master was dressed like he had just come from a stock photo shoot and had never even seen a cargo ship before. 

“Gentleman, my name is Captain James Pettersson. It’s an honor to pilot this fine vessel.” He said with his perfect posture revealing his previous military experience.

“That’s actually my job.” Ben said, easing his hand awkwardly. 

“Well of course!” Captain James— no that’s too weird I’m just gonna call him James— said making his way over to the front of the bridge. 

Feeling the awkward silence grew heavier than the ship I decided I needed to leave. 

“Well I better go do my rounds.” I said to no one’s reaction, Carlos was still holding back laughter as he finished up his watch log notes. 

Opening the metal sliding door on the starboard side of the bridge I immediately realized we may be in port for quite some time. A thick fog had descended on the entire port, I couldn’t even see the 40 foot containers in the shipping yard just over the railing. 

The air was crisp and chilly with the never ending sounds of New York posing as an infinite soundtrack to our work. 

Walking from line to line checking the auto-tension is still working properly (it almost always is) I got an odd feeling of dread. 

It was probably just new job anxieties not helped with the ere setting surrounding me. Walking through the deck I realized just how thick the fog actually was, the only visible objects in my line of sight were the railing around the bow of the ship leading to white fog so thick it looked more like a blank piece of paper than one of the busiest ports in the country. 

Finishing my round I reported to the bridge, Carlos was gone, Ben was still at his post drawing busy looking doodles on a piece of paper. James was standing straight with his hands clasped behind his back and staring out at the white cloud surrounding our ship.

“Hoping the fog clears sooner rather than later.” He said trying to cut through the silence that fell on the bridge since his arrival.

“A vessel like this yearns for the sea” James adds. 

Ben dropped his head in his hands in exhaustion.

Holy shit was I right that we weren’t leaving port for a while, I just got off assisting with departure. 

James was on the verge of canceling the whole departure until the fog finally began to lift at around 1 pm today.

When I got there Carlos was ranting to Sam who had a look of either fear or annoyance in his eyes. I didn’t hear much of what he said but something about him was “a fine woman waiting for me in Manhattan.” And that he wanted the departure would just get cancelled already.

When I saw the fog lifted, it lifted just enough for the crane operators to actually see where they were loading the crates onto the cargo line, the fog was still present throughout departure. 

The white mist in the distance seemingly rendered the beautiful New York City skyline as we went for a visual treat for our tired eyes.

Now just the simple 15 day trek to Dublin!

Feb 27th, 2024.

Something is wrong with Sam. His watch notes are getting shorter and shorter. He has been missing random information in the last three entries. First he missed the hatch status, then he didn’t mention if there was any discharge in the VCP. 

Stuff that's easy to forget when we first start out, but when I tried to mention it to him in the mess hall today he just didn’t say anything, just sitting there staring at me with his blank expression. I’m not sure why but the look he gave me freaked me out. He just looked at me like I was speaking an alien language and like he was trying to kill me with his eyes. 

Safe to say, I’m staying the fuck away from that weirdo until he hit Ireland. 

March 9th, 2024. 

Sorry for the lack of entries, it’s hard thinking of interesting ways to write the same day over and over. 

Big development though… We hit Dublin! 

James is still the Hollywood trope equivalent of a ship captain. The other day I saw him leaning over the radar with his head in his hands in utter confusion. As soon as he noticed me there he sprang up like a soldier at attention. 

I never saw exactly what he was looking at but it clearly confused him. We were in the middle of the atlantic, the ocean can have odd effects on people, maybe he was just looking for a path between other ships. 

“Everything okay?” I asked

“Of course, She’s running like a dream!” he said with an air of delusional confidence. 

Good enough for me. Weirdo.

Oh also can’t forget Sam, his watch notes are still missing shit and honestly I’m too scared to call him on it, he definitely seems the type to “accidentally” push you overboard when you're going for a smoke. 

Anyway this port is pretty busy so we are probably gonna be here a while once we dock. I'm gonna go do some sight seeing!

March 11th, 2024. 

Gotta love 48 hours stuck in port. 

At least James let us off to go around the town, he even gave us a curfew of 1 AM. Maybe he’s not so bad after all. 

He even came out with us to the bar last night. Sam even came out, which is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. As per usual he kept to himself and barely said a word, I think he’s getting the can as soon as we get back to NYC. 

As soon as James saw him come out of his uber in front of the bar it looked like he just saw someone get shot, there was an awkward tension between them all night. 

After about an hour of chatting shit and drinking far too much Guiness I noticed both Sam and James were no longer sitting at the long table with the other crewmen. 

I went out for a cigarette shortly after and when I walked out the side of the bar I heard a heated conversation, not quite yelling but clearly a topic of passion. 

Trying not to look nosey I slowly walked my way toward the source of the sound in the alley. When I reached the corner I saw Sam and James in a heated argument. 

I couldn’t make out exactly what they were saying but I think I heard James say; 

“How can you expect me to rationalize it?” 

They noticed me staring and quickly stopped talking and walked towards me. Sam went directly back inside but James came over to me with his shit eating grin. 

“Gotta spare buddy?” He said pointing at my half ashed cigarette. 

When I tried to ask what they were talking about James just kept saying, “Sam just has some ideas he hasn't quite thought through.” 

I tried to press further on what those ideas were exactly but he just kept saying it’s gonna be fine and not to worry about it.

Eventually I just gave up and we finished my butt and went back inside.

March 12th, 2024 

Finally made it back to sea. Don’t get me wrong Dublin was amazing but with the tension between Sam and James I’m ready to get this voyage over with.

I will say Ireland couldn’t say a more beautiful goodbye during our departure. The setting sun paints the sky a gorgeous shade of red, giving our tired eyes a glimpse of Mother Nature's infinite beauty before being plunged into the black void of the ocean at night. 

Setting course for Jacksonville, then back to NYC for the end of my month at sea. 

It’s currently 2 AM and I’m sitting here with Ben completely dead asleep at his post even though I can hear the Dead Kennedys album blasting in his headphones from here. 

If James walks in we’d both be in shit. I should probably wake him up. He’s taught me how to watch the radars and steer clear of any oncoming ships so I think he’s comfortable enough to leave me to keep watch of the bridge for his beauty sleep. 

There’s something about the sea, especially the sea at night. You are in an environment that you — by any measure of human comprehension — are not welcome in. 

Right now I could take a step over a railing the height of my nipples and there would never be a trace of my physical body again. No matter how strong you are or how well you can swim, the endless waves just a few feet away have infinite energy and infinite time. 

I hate the way my mind wanders during these night shifts. I’m gonna wake Ben up. 

March 14th, 2024.

I’m done with Sam’s shit. If he’s having some mental breakdown he needs to just get off in Jacksonville and get help. 

His notes still suck, he refuses to take any accountability or even listen to me when I try to show him what he’s missing. I even offered to join him on watch and show him how to communicate what you do in the notes. The fucker just looked at me with a threatening silence that made the ice cold ocean seem welcoming. 

He also started doing this thing, I don’t know how to explain it without just showing you the notes. Ever since we left Dublin he has added seemingly random words to the end of each of his notes. 

I’ll write down an example here if that helps.

“Lights and Gainway tended, Cargo inventory complete, security LVL 1 is maintained. **SOON**”

The last word in that makes no sense. “**SOON**”. 

That was the first one that happened yesterday. Today he left the word “**BACK**”. 

I don’t even know what to make of it or if I should care at all. I’m gonna talk to James about sending him home once we reach Jacksonville, some people just aren’t built for the isolation of the ocean. 

March 17th, 2024 

I think the tension on the ship is reaching a boiling point. Carlos and I seem to be the only ones getting along. Ben still hates James, James hasn’t left the bridge in almost 24 hours. 

Sam is still being weird, still doing the weird random words thing. The last few have been; “**STILL, FINGERS, STOPPED, WARMER**.” in that order. 

I’m getting so sick of these guys man, most of my time not on shift I just hide in my room or exchanging rants with Carlos in the mess hall. 

I just have this feeling I can’t get over that something is coming, the nights are long. I have been losing more and more sleep every night since we left Dublin. Last night I had an awful panic attack as soon as I set foot on the bridge. 

My heart was pounding in my chest, I felt freezing but began to sweat like a pig. Carlos saw me standing in the doorway of the bridge and just before my knees buckled he grabbed me a desk chair and practically forced me to sit down and grabbed me a water. 

“Don’t worry about it man, everyone gets a bit jittery in the open ocean from time to time.” He said, patting me on the back before returning to finish his notes. 

I really like Carlos, with everything that's been going on I feel like he's the only normal person on this ship. In the few hours of sleep I have been getting I have been having recurring nightmares that the men on this ship are the last people on earth. 

We keep sailing forward for weeks and weeks never reaching land. Like we are sailing on another planet that has nothing but ocean that goes on forever. 

Jacksonville can’t come fast enough. 

**The next couple pages are dated but there is no actual text. The dates start from March 18th to March 20th. It seems he went to write something but just couldn’t for an unknown reason.**

We’ve stopped.
