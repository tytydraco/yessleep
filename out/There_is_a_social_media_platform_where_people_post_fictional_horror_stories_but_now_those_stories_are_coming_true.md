The rules were simple. Post fictional stories where the source of horror isn’t human. The author cannot be the antagonist and must be alive in the story or in a state to post to the platform. Everyone was to act as if the stories were true in the comments and elsewhere on the website. ‘Fake it till you make it’ seems to have become literally true with that corner of the internet. But I am getting ahead of myself.   
  
I am your average wannabe author and horror genre fan. Often writing short stories online for practice and to get ideas out of my system. So it was only natural that I found myself on the social media platform reading horror short stories, admiring the talent of authors on the platform, and getting no sleep. When I had the time and inspiration, I’d occasionally contribute to the platform. Even though I must admit, my writing wasn’t super popular or well-received. But that’s how I know for sure that the stories were fictional, you know when I heard the news. I am not going to share the name of the website for the obvious reason, now that the horrors from the site are coming true, I don’t want evil humans/ beings to add to our terrible experiences.   
  
When you love writing horror, you figure out that the source of horror can be anything. People’s creativity and ideas turn everyday objects and places into thrilling horrifying tales. I never thought I’d become a part of a very real one myself though. And that is what makes this so scary, you can’t trust anything or anyplace now.  We have multiple places that are infested with zombie-like entities, sinister buildings, horrible paintings coming alive, aliens hiding under human skin, video games controlling life, ghosts with real powers and not just something grandma sighted in her young days, spirits taking over people’s thoughts, and other unimaginable terrors (actually, now that I think about it, they are very imaginable because someone imagined each of those before they came alive).  
  
It all started with a news report as I sipped my morning cup of organic cacao and creamy nutty-flavored oat milk. The mug felt heavy in my hands and the light blue and white aesthetics on its outer surface made it a perfect way to start my day. I turned to my phone and opened YouTube. The first channel I clicked on was the news live broadcast. “The country’s police force is shocked with the sudden surge of cases involving supernatural beings…” before I could proceed further, I got a notification of a text message from my friend. I momentarily zoned out as I read the text, “Girllll, I think my Bonny Angel dolls aren’t regular dolls, they are alive.” I saw this text and before I could even think about, what to think about, regarding the text, she sent another one, “And they are fucking up anyone who is being mean to me.” And another one, “Even as a joke.”  
  
Something about the text sounded familiar and I remembered the story I read about the Bonny collectible baby angel dolls on the website. The dolls are famous for being collected by young working women in their twenties and thirties. They are meant to provide stress relief and protection to their owners. The story revolved around the dolls suddenly coming to life and killing everyone the dolls’ owners loved.   
“Diana stop playing with me, its like six in the morning. I didn’t know you followed  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ too. \* laughter emoji \* \* laughter emoji\*”. I typed and went back to my app. 

  
“Just came in that a subscription service for skincare is making people believe their skin isn’t real, so much so that many of them are attempting to peel their skin with knives and other objects.”  I almost spit out my drink. I definitely knew this story. It was from the same social media website. Using a ‘test before you buy’ skincare product line, the protagonist began to see their distorted image in pictures, reflections, and ultimately in the mirror. The moisturizer that promised an ethereal glow ended up convincing the person that someone was trying to get into their body (skin deep). Whatever it was, was trying to take over their life while trapping their conscience in a small part of their mind ‘Get Out’ style. The story ended with them trying to take their skin off. 

  
‘Is this a prank?’ I thought and switched to a different news channel. “People are being warned not to go running near the beach at night. No, it isn’t a tsunami warning, shark danger, or human thugs. In what seems to be a straight-out-of-fiction movie, footage recovered from a lighthouse shows that a ship has been seen picking up passengers and sailing away to nothingness night after night.” Before the newsperson even said another word, I remembered the story I had read. A humongous ship appears exactly at 3:13 AM at a specific beach every night. Anyone present on the beach at the time, regardless of who they are or their mental condition is convinced they need to be on the ship, no exceptions. At 3:33, the ship turns and after moving forward a couple of meters into the sea, it disappears.       

  
‘No way, no freaking way’,  it was too much to take early in the morning.  You will think this is something that only happens in the movies, but I legit thought about whether I was just dreaming the entire thing and pinched myself. A thought entered my head, a story I had read the day before. The story said that the sky was turning strange colors and we could see big planets and portals in the sky as if they were right here, next to earth. It was a sign that a portal to a different world had opened to ours. If this stuff from the stories was true, the sky would be strange. I looked at my phone, ‘6:30 AM’ it showed me. I swallowed and walked up to my blinds. Slowly with shaky fingers, I manually lifted one of the blinds and peeked as my heart raced. 

  
It was a glowy pink holographic color. The shades seemed strange. White bright planet-like orbs hung in the sky. I quickly closed the blinds. Before I could figure out what to do with what I now knew, there was a knock on my door. ‘Oh fuck fuck fuckkkkk’, I whispered under my breath. My steps approached the door to my apartment slowly. I was shaking as I put an eye into the peephole. I looked and stared out and saw nothing. I know what you’ll say about what I did next. I know this was a dumb thing to do but I was so shit scared that my brain just wasn’t working. I opened my door and peeked into the hallway outside. I saw no person anywhere close. As my eyes were scanning the area, I looked down and saw an envelope. In neatly typed letters, I saw six block words on the top of the white formal envelope. ‘New Rules for Staying at \_\_\_\_’ it said. The blank space had the name of my apartment complex.  
  
A felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. This story never ended well. I picked up the envelope and tore it into pieces immediately. I dropped the tiny bits of paper from the envelope and the sheet inside of it to the floor but from the corner of my eye, I saw something move. I thought I saw a bug move in my direction from the end of the hallway where the elevators are. So I turned my attention towards the now rapidly fast-approaching insect. It wasn’t a bug, it was one of those Bonny Angel dolls. It had a grey headgear and a tiny unclothed body made of plastic. The thing ran with its tiny-ass plastic legs at an abnormally fast pace. I took off my slipper as quickly as I could. As soon as the doll came close to me I hit it with my slipper like a tennis racket hits a tennis ball with all of the force in my body and yeeted that thing straight into the closing elevator door. The doll crashed at the backside of the elevator just as I heard the elevator doors close. 

  
I ran in as my phone rang and locked the door shut behind me. I knew better than to pick my ringing phone up and had a new voicemail immediately. Later when I opened the voicemail, it was someone trying to give me a new set of rules. Deleted that thing before they could say one word of the rule. There are rules in my kitchen microwave that I just installed yesterday. There is a set of rules stuck outside my window which is on the third floor. When I tried to turn on the news channel again, the news anchor was trying to share a set of rules. 

  
I am hiding in my bathroom with the biggest knife I own and a baseball bat. I also got my laptop in here. I think my phone is more of a hazard than a tool at this point so it stays outside. After researching the web, I’ve realized the sky is this holographic pink only in my city. I think that, as of now, the stories are only manifesting here. But I don’t think what has started here will stop here. I believe that this is only the starting point. 

  
Maybe I can get out of the city to safety and find a way to stop this while I myself am in a safer place. I don’t know how I’ll do that though, I don’t have a car. I suspect any public transport will take me to a place outside of the physical realm. A theory I have is that the collective conscience and fear of the people on the social media platform have birthed life into their fictional stories. Maybe, it is their collective effort that can make this stop. This device will get discharged soon. I will have to go out at some point and get my charger. 

  
I’ll probably have to get out of the house at some point too, but those damn dolls…
