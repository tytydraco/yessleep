Let me take you back to early August 2005, maybe the first or 2nd Friday of the month.  My parents, my sister, and I had just started the first day our yearly vacation. If you don’t know of it, there is a small barrier island that hangs off the bottom of Maryland that is a vaguely popular getaway destination. It’s small, with a population of not a lot and can honestly be described as a kind of tourist trap of sorts. To us it was something special, in its own way. I suppose it still is now, even after everything.

I still remember us pulling on to the island via the bridge that extends over the channel, hearing the cackling seagulls and the sight of boats bobbing in lazy waters - the heralds of our arrival to a week away from home. The sky was hazy that day with wide, gauze-like expanses of cloud cover. A constant breeze blew in through the truck windows as my parents argued lightly about why the island seemed so empty when we arrived that week.

Dad had been saying that folks were probably afraid of the incoming storms or something, joking about those same people missing a great deal on rental homes. I found out later that the prices had plummeted substantially in the weeks leading up to our vacation and there was a lot of availability. Looking back now, I can see the signs of missing cars and less than crowded ice cream parlors. There were still a good number of other people on the island but there was a feeling of emptiness to the place. It made the laughter of the gulls seem all the louder, taking up the silence left by diminished traffic.

We had picked up our house key and made our way to our home away from home, the usual course of action. It had some gaudy tourist-trappy name that had been daubed on a signpost at the end of the crushed shell driveway. Of the details I do remember, that isn’t one of them. All of the houses on the island had cheesy names, something to help lure tourists like us in, but it was a beautiful house. For some reason, I imagine it always will be despite whatever happens around it.

It was painted in soft yet dark green (or was it grey?) color, making the brilliant white of the trim and railings stick out like veneered teeth across the two stories of the house. Natural, towering fences of hardy trees and ornamental grass separated everything but the backyards from the neighboring houses that stood a healthy distance to either side. It was a far cry from the crowded suburbia where we hailed from. Even then, the playful shouting and stomping of kids across a wooden deck next door could be heard as we stretched cramping legs.

Like any other kids of our age, our assistance with unloading the truck lasted probably no more than 10 minutes. It didn’t take much for my sister, Maddy, or I to start darting from room to room to check out our home away from home that week. The spacious rooms, clean and tidy from the housekeepers who had vacated just moments before we arrived, all had the same smell of sand and artificial lemon cleaner. We tore through them, inspecting every cabinet or loudly which room was going to be ours, shouting like junior conquistadors from the 2^(nd) floor sundeck. Two boys in the backyard next door, imaginary peasants to our equally imagined royalty, had craned their necks up at us from their connected backyard as we drank in our temporary world.

And from there we saw the backyard, from between the white posts of the railing. Through the glass double doors below us, past the back deck and down the path leading off of it, was a small pier jutting out past the marshy waters edge. We had never had one close to one of the previous rentals before. Our feet had dashed down the steps, excited pleas babbling to our parents to let us go look. They had let us go out with a tired bemusement on two conditions: that we would come back if it didn’t look safe and to not bring any swampy mud back inside. Most of it was directed to me, since I was older than Maddy by 4 years. We had agreed to those terms with all the eagerness of children who hadn’t listened to a word of it and fled into the hazy sunlight beyond the doors.

The air smelled of cut lawns, saltwater, and low tide, all of it carried in a heady mix on the growing breeze. Tiny, choppy waves danced and ebbed into the seagrass that reached up past the edge of dry land. Fiddler crabs had scampered into their burrows our pounding approach across the planks of the pier. It was old but sturdy, salt rime and algae growth marking the heights of the tide on the posts sunk into the earth. There is a certain magic to looking across a body of water to the land beyond, to feel another environment take hold of your senses. Maddy and I had giggled and laughed as we looked down, pointing out the shapes of larger crabs and tiny fish that moved in the murky green-brown waters.

It was then that I saw it there from the edge of the pier, maybe twenty or so feet away in the deeper waters to the left. I had to blink against the light shimmering on the surface to make sure it wasn’t just trash someone had dumped off of a boat.

“Hey, is that a horse under the water?” the words sound stupid now but what else do you say when you see something like that? It was as if someone had dropped a carousel figure into the water, the general outline hard to mistake for much else. Maddy knew better though. She was a bit of a horse nerd back then, her room at our home sporting a sizeable shrine of books and toys. There were even a couple of shirts that I used to make fun of her for, some of them stowed away in her luggage back at the house.

Maddy had stood close to me, getting up on her tiptoes to see before saying, “They don’t have horses here, Mikey. They only have ponies!”

“Same difference,” I had mumbled, watching the strange sight before us. It sat there, seemingly grazing on the bottom of the shallow ocean bed, the head low and its form stationary. We couldn’t make much of it from our spot, the waves making it difficult to pick out details as they rolled and rippled. The ocean waters made the painted hide look green and sickly while strange, short spots and streaks decorated its pelt at random. Maddy had raised her hand in a wave and called out in a sing-song voice.

“Hi, pony!”

It didn’t move or if it did, we couldn’t tell at all.  I had laughed at her, forgetting that I also had been 9 years old once, and was about to tell her how dumb she sounded when someone spoke.

“Whatcha looking at?”

We had jumped at the voice, seeing two boys approaching us across the planking. Our focus had been solely on the curiosity before us and hadn’t even heard them approach. One was definitely older than me but the other clutched a green teddy bear under one arm as he walked in the shadow of his brother. He couldn't have been much older than Maddy.

“There’s a horse- I mean, pony in the water,” I had told them, my words excited at showing off our discovery, “Want to see?”

“Is that some kind of game you’re playing?” the older boy asked dismissively as he scratched at a cluster of acne on his face. My jaw tightened with teenage annoyance as he kept speaking, “Want to play tag or try and catch some crabs with us? We found some scoops and shovels under the porch.”

“I wanna see a horsey, Henry,” the younger boy had asked meekly, tugging on his brother’s shirt. I had smiled at him and he raised his stuffed animal up to his chest, putting another ward between him and us. Maddy had her back to them, quietly focused on the pony.

“It’s not a game,” I said, pointing out to where it was, “There’s something out there.”

My olive branch in sharing the oddity in the water withered as Henry’s eyes rolled, perfectly synced with a dramatic huff. Regardless, he walked to the end of the pier with all of the confidence of a teen who knew when they were the oldest one present.

“C’mon, David,” he grumbled, letting his brother shuffled behind him. I moved closer to Maddy, giving them space to occupy. It didn’t take long for their eyes to widen in surprise.

“Holy hell! You’re not lying! Look at that stupid thing down there,” Henry had said, craning forward to see it better. David bounced on his feet, a grin spreading across his face behind his stuffed animals head. They began to wave and yell at the submerged equine, trying to get its attention. I had winced at both the sudden behavior and knowing how my parents felt about anyone swearing around my sister. These kids were not my kind of friends and I felt regret at even humoring the idea of them joining us in those moments. But I felt something else as I heard something.

It was a plaintive whining sound, as if an RC car was held aloft while its tire spun. I knew it by heart and I spun in place. It was one that Maddy made when she was afraid of something. Her eyes were saucers staring out into the water, lip quivering as she continued her sad siren sound.

“Mikey,” she started in a whisper, so low that I had to bend close to hear her words pouring out in a panicked rush, “That’s not a pony. Ponies need to breathe air. Why is it breathing water?”

We’d been so distracted by the novelty of the idea that we never thought of the very basic requirements of nature. If Maddy’s words had made the warm breeze feel arctic against my skin, then the sudden *p-toosh* sound of something hitting the water made my blood freeze.

Henry had found a stone. It probably was one lodged between the planks of the pier or one he had found fascination with and was simply carrying it around. I imagine it was one that any adolescent boy at would have been happy to find, of good weight and shape – the kind that fits into the curve of your hand. And with the thoughtless idea of cruelty that only children are capable of, he had let it fly towards another creature with no remorse. The water rippled in fading ring mere feet away from the pony, the stone well lost to the depths by the time it moved.

It didn’t move like a pony should have. I still don’t know what a pony moving underwater should look like but it wasn’t that. It was too smooth, a soft gliding motion as it propelled itself towards us. Shadowy murk shed itself in degrees and a wake of water crested forward as it reached shallower and shallower ground, foot by slow foot. The arch of a back began to break the surface. Someone gasped in surprise. Maybe it was Maddy or one of the other boys. I don’t think I will ever remember, even it was me. All I recall seeing that thing and how everything was wrong.

Bulging, bloated flanks of grease colored white and rotted brown pushed straining ribs against the skin of the creature, the bones rippling the waters surface as it moved. Small spines, not barnacles, dotted the pelt in an irregular pattern like fingers poking through cloth. Its legs were lost in the debris kicked up from the seabed. We should have run but I don’t know what would have happened if we had or if we even could. I now believe we were paralyzed by some combination of awe and animal fear in those moments and that if we had run, something else could have happened – something sudden and awful. Lost in that moment, all we did was look on as it stared back.

Maddy had once told me proudly that horses have some of the largest eyes on land, able to see almost in every direction. That is one of those pieces of useless information that has been lodged in the recesses of my brain, a piece of popcorn kernel stuck in a mental gumline. It gives me anything but comfort when I think now of those tumescent globes of sight, fat and ripe with unknowable things, that regarded us as they cleared the surface, raised up by its twisted, stumpy neck. They seemed to fill everything in those moments.

Those strange moments are like recalling something while in the throes of a fever. I felt floaty, the world becoming a waxy smear in my mind. Breezy words, or perhaps concepts are a more accurate term for it, weaved through the wind and chuckling lapping of tiny waves as it felt like the pier could drift away from under my feet as those tumescent eyes seemed to fill everything.  I could see that was Maddy drifting forward, a small foot lifting over the edge of the planks. But we all were moving too, heeding that call to… something. I remember the water seeming like an eternity below us and something else. Someone quietly whispering, “hey,” in a long drawn out voice.

Everything seemed so slow and it wasn’t until those eyes sunk like twin eclipses into the syrupy waves, that the world caught back up to itself. The whispers became yells, the world becoming sharp and clear again in degrees. I grabbed Maddy, pulling her back as she tilted forward on the foot that was extended over the edge, barely keeping myself from toppling over either. Nobody was able to stop Henry from toppling over into the saltwater. He erupted into shouts as he flailed and sputtered. David wailed at the top of his lungs, strangling the non-existent life from his teddy bear in a death grip.

My dad sprinted across the yard, sunglasses bouncing off of his head. He continued shouting, his words growing clearer by the moment in my ears. I don’t think I know the last time I had seen him run or in a panic before then. I don’t think a lot of kids realize how bad things are until they see a parent run like that. He had charged down the walkway and splashed into the water, grabbing the floundering boy and guiding him back to firmer ground as his own shoes sank into muck. My heart had leapt into my throat when he had done that, fearing that he was so close to the thing that had been calling to us.

But when I looked there was no sign of the pony, just a scattering of sea foam and rippling water. 

With Henry back on firmer land, the two other boys had run back to their home at a tear. Their mother emerged shortly after, screeching like a banshee at my parents and us. It didn’t take long to figure out that they blamed my sister and I for what happened, regardless of what we had collectively seen. Thanks to mom’s more level-headed approach, my parents eventually calmed everything down to an easy to overhear argument. A resolution was reached, probably taking the mutual agreement that neither family interact with each other anymore during our respective stays. Whatever it was, I’ve never been able to find out. I never saw any of them again after that.

We received a good scolding of our own once everything was said and done. Dad said he saw us looking like we were about to step off of the pier and into the water. As he regaled us with the dangers of the ocean, it occurred to me that I don’t think he saw the “pony” in full or at all. Maybe it was the fearful focus of a parent witnessing children do something dangerous or perhaps an unwillingness to admit to seeing something hard to reconcile but he shut me down whenever I tried to tell him about what we had seen. Mom took his side, having seen nothing more than dad run into the marshy waters. We weren’t punished, just told that we would be missing out on pizza that day and were given a warning about doing “childish stunts like that ever again”. Not that it mattered. Maddy and I both avoided the water for the rest of our stay. I still do now, all these years later.

During all of this, Maddy hadn’t said anything at all and took the scolding in silence. I am fairly certain that she didn’t listen to any of it. She had instead stared off past my parents to the waterfront, never taking her eyes off of it. I think she knew that it wasn’t going to be the last time we saw that thing. And I hate how right she was.
