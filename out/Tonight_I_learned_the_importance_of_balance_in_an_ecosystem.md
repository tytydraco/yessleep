I used to think my mother was insane. The way she planted flowers wherever she wanted, instead of neatly in beds like my friend’s moms. The way she hung dried herbs in the kitchen and piled books around the house. It seemed like she always did the opposite of every other adult I knew.

&#x200B;

The thing that probably got to me the most was her radical acceptance of every living thing.

 

*“Oh, leave the wasp nest be, they eat the caterpillars!”*

&#x200B;

*“Why would I bother the spiders in the bathroom? Do you see any other bugs?”*

&#x200B;

*“Oh, leave poor Mr. Benson be. His bark is worse than his bite if you don’t cross him.”*

&#x200B;

I tried to understand my mom, but it was hard. She talked about balance and ecosystems, but my friends didn’t have cobwebs in their bathrooms, worry about getting stung in the yard, or chart a wide berth around mean old Mr. Benson. 

&#x200B;

Still, I tried. I left the wasps and spiders alone. I dutifully brought over the pies to Mr. Benson that my mom baked for him. He never opened the door, but he’d always leave the empty pie tin back on our porch within a day or two. 

&#x200B;

Then one night I walked home alone from my friend’s house. It wasn’t far, but there was a stretch of still, dark woods along the way that always made the hair on my neck rise. 

&#x200B;

Tonight was no different. Worse, in fact. The distance between the street lights seemed to stretch further and further. The feeling of being watched was intense. I knew mom was waiting for me on our porch, likely with a book and a mug of chamomile, but our house was still out of sight around the bend. With painfully few street lights to light the way. 

&#x200B;

My gut screamed at me to run, but I kept my pace. We had cougars around here, breaking into a run was a sure way for a kid like me to end up as dinner. Still, I picked my pace up and scanned the trees as I went. 

&#x200B;

Up ahead of me, the bushes rustled. I froze, feeling my heartbeat through my whole body. I was so focused on the woods ahead of me that I nearly jumped out of my skin when a guttural moan sounded from behind me. 

&#x200B;

I whipped around and time slowed to a crawl as my brain tried to compute what had staggered out of the woods and stood in the light of the closest streetlamp. It was a deer, at least, I think it was supposed to be. Standing on its hind legs, looking off into the distance, it heaved huge plumes of smoke into the chilly autumn air. Ribbons of flesh hung from its antlers and I wondered how I hadn’t smelled its stench sooner. I took an uncertain step backward and the creature's head snapped toward me. 

&#x200B;

I loved horror movies, but I always thought the characters were stupid. Always making the wrong moves, stepping on the twig or sneezing, going the wrong way. *Not me,* I'd think smugly. All of that smugness died as I saw the unnatural way the creature jerked toward me with sickening speed. I turned to run, and tripped and fell. Hyperventilating, I tried to crawl away, but I was shaking so hard my arms wouldn’t work properly. I didn’t know what else to do, so I curled into a ball, shaking as I heard its hooves drag closer. I lay there thinking about my mom. Hoping this creature wouldn’t find her next. Then I heard the bushes rustle again. 

&#x200B;

I felt rather than saw something large burst out of the trees and fly over me, pinning the creature to the ground with a vicious growl. Legs weak, I crab-walked away from them, unable to look away. This creature was hairy, massive and from the squealing sounds that the deer-creature was making, very hungry. 

&#x200B;

I crawled backward to the last streetlight before the bend in the road and stopped, still unable to stand. The hairy creature stood on its hind legs, like the deer had and turned toward me. I was too exhausted to try to run as it approached. This creature, however, began to change as it walked toward me. By the time it reached me, it had shrunk down to normal person-size and taken the shape of Mr. Benson. 

&#x200B;

He scanned the forest and then offered me a hand up, which I took. We both pretended not to see the wet stain on my pants. He cleared his throat.

&#x200B;

“It’s late. You should head home.”

&#x200B;

I nodded and turned to leave. 

&#x200B;

“Hey kid.”

&#x200B;

I turned back to him.

&#x200B;

“Tell your mom thanks for the pies.”

&#x200B;

I nodded dumbly and broke into a run for home. I held it together pretty well too, until I saw my mom waiting on the porch. Then the sobs ripped through me as I threw myself into her arms. She quickly whisked me inside and within minutes I sat wrapped in a blanket with my own mug of chamomile. I gave her a halting account of my ordeal and finished gravely, “Mom, I think Mr. Benson is some kind of monster.”

&#x200B;

She smiled and brushed the hair out of my eyes. 

&#x200B;

“Of course he is, sweetheart.”

&#x200B;

I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. “You *knew?”*

&#x200B;

“Well yes, do you see any other monsters around here?”

&#x200B;

I used to think my mom was insane. Now I know she’s a genius.
