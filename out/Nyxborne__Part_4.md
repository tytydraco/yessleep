I woke up in my bed. A sluggish fog flowed through my memory. Last I remembered, I was on the floor of my basement, bleeding out. I craned my neck, trying to get a glimpse of the window, but none was there. I wasn’t in my cabin, but at a hotel. The ugly wallpaper created a cage around me.

My phone buzzed and I felt myself pick it up, as if I wasn’t in control of my body. The screen lit up, and the date crossed my eyes. Twelve years in the past. The date sent a shiver down my spine. The day everything went wrong.

I got out of bed without moving. I had no control over the actions I felt myself commit. I was living, experiencing a memory. When they say your life flashes before your eyes, I’d hoped it wasn’t the worst days of your life.

I threw a shirt on and grabbed my keys off the dresser, heading outside. A call from the D.N.A. told me I was required to head to a hunt. My truck was my armory. I hadn’t constructed my cabin yet. I drove to their headquarters, brushing my teeth with my finger.

A far younger Nathan met me with a smile. We shook, and he led me to a conference room.

”So, ready for another hunt?”

A shrugged with a smile, “I’m not new, I’ve been doing this for three years now, man.”

”You’re still a rookie in our eyes,” he turned on a projector, “Our local national park has had an incredible amount of disappearances near one of their most popular trailheads. Our researchers have determined that it is the location of a Wendigo Nest.

I hadn’t ever faced a Wendigo. I heard of them, of how disgusting and annoying they are to deal with, but seeing one face-to-face hadn’t happened to me yet.

”Send me that way and I’ll kill it,” I smiled cockily, having no idea the world of hurt this ego would cause me.

\*\*\*

I was posted up in a tree saddle, covered in camouflage and an oak scent to mask my smell. The nest was a hundred feet in front and forty feet below me. It was a dark hole directly in the floor of the forest. Blackish-purple vines crawled out of the hole, killing the grass they sank into. Wendigo nests were nasty little things, crafted by coughing up mucus and spreading it around like mud. They were deep craters, impossible for prey to escape, but easy for their creators to enter.

My eyes sharpened as movement drew my attention. The creator of the pit emerged. The Wendigo had deep brown skin with patches of hair on its elbows. Its tail was long, with the vertebrae sticking out further than the pictures I’d seen, mimicking spines. On its head was the skull of a grizzly bear.

It looked around, careful to observe its surroundings before crawling away on all fours. It was on the hunt. I slid down from the tree and moved to the nest. The sticky squelching of the vines under my feet sent a shiver down my spine. I wrapped my hands around one and lowered myself into the hole.

There were bodies inside, remains of the hikers desecrated in ways indescribable. They were being saved as food, something not normal for Wendigos. They usually hunt for sport. I learned why when I turned around.

Wendigo reproduction is entirely asexual. They devour bones, muscle, blood, pretty much any biological material they can, and coat it with their mucus. Once it sits for a bit, they vomit it up. The mucus changes the DNA in the embryo they generate, turning all the animal and human gunk in there into a small Wendigo child. One that sat before me right now.

It was a small being, no larger than a dog. Its skin was a dark green, with a tiny body and legs like paperclips. It stared at me with an obvious curiosity. It didn’t yet have a skull, no trophy to hide its face behind. Its face, like most of its kind, was noseless, a sack of flesh on a skull pulled tight, with a jaw that hung open. It walked around me in an attempt to understand what I was. A human, at the very least a living one, it had never seen.

I didn’t have time to deal with the child; I needed to set a trap for the mother before she returned. I loaded a silver birdshot round into my shotgun and pulled the trigger. The head of the creature flowered, its body flew into the fleshy wall, and, for a moment, it rolled in pain without half its head, before ceasing.

The noise hurt my ears, and I rubbed the inside with my pinky. The mistake I’d made was clear, and I hadn’t noticed. The noise of the blast had drawn the mother back to the nest, and I caught a glimpse of her in the reflection of my shotgun. I wasn’t able to fire before she was upon me. The rage, only that of a mother who’d lost their child, rained upon me. My body couldn’t take the pain, but the Wendigo didn’t let me pass out. Every strike was deliberate; her knowledge of the human body let her keep me awake while she dug into me.

I’d like to say I escaped. I would like to say I found a way to defeat the beast like I always did. I didn’t. I sat there for three days, my body being kept alive by makeshift bandages the monster had created to keep me from death. My mouth was forced open, and raw meat from a hunt it had gone on was forced down my throat to keep me fed.

On the third day, she returned without food. The Wendigo stood over me, her face filled with determination. Her claw met my throat, or what was left of it, and began to press. As I accepted my demise with open arms, I watched as a silver blade erupted from its chest. The Wendigo tried to scream, but simply flopped off me. Two hunters slid down into the cave, surveying the area and ensuring the mother was dead. When they found me, they conversed about putting a bullet in me, which I would have begged for if I could’ve spoken.

They didn’t.

I was airlifted from the nest, pulled into the Department’s blacksite hospital. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirrors they had. I didn’t look like a human anymore, more like a pile of pink and red. Something that couldn’t be identified.

They poked me. They prodded at me. They opened me up and found what made me tick. They pulled me apart and pieced me back together. I finally lost consciousness when they injected a purple-black liquid into my mass of flesh.

When I finally awoke, I had a form. One that looked nearly identical to how I did before. I looked at my arms. They were scarred with stitches up and down them. Similar wounds coated my chest. The mirror revealed my face, tired and hurt. Deep within my body was a soreness that hasn’t left to this day. A hunger.

Nathan entered the room, holding a clipboard.

“Can you understand me?” His question seemed stupid, but I nodded.

“Can you speak, Jason?” He raised an eyebrow.

“I can,” The voice that came from my throat was mine, but held a slight tone shift. Something wasn’t right, but I expected that with how I was put back together.

“How am I still alive?” I asked, genuinely curious.

Nathan didn’t respond immediately, but when he did, it brought my humanity crashing down.

“You weren’t. We lost you six times on that table. It was a two-week operation, nonstop.”

“Nobody can survive that,” I responded.

“Correct,” He handed me the clipboard, “No person.”

The clipboard showed me biological data, scans of my body, and musculature. Notes about a serum extracted from the Wendigo that was killed were scrawled in the margins.

“Our scientists determined you would die unless we took extreme measures. Considering you didn’t have anything to lose, we injected you with a concentrated formula that included Wendigo DNA. It bonded to your cells, and they reformed. You now have improved musculature, you now heal faster, your eyes can see colors we can’t.”

“I’m not human?” I asked. The words caught in my throat.

“Not anymore,” He nodded, ‘The effect could have caused mental issues as well, but you seem okay. The docs will run more tests on you to make sure.”

The doctors ran their tests. I had changed mentally. My body craved a hunt, a primal urge to kill something, anything. It wasn’t dangerous, nor was there a need to tear humans apart, but it remained in the back of my mind like an itch. I assume this is why I’m different, why I can't build relationships with people.

I’m a beast in a man’s body.

\*\*\*

My eyes opened, and the same hospital room was around me, like a recurring nightmare. Julia was in the corner of the room, sleeping. She looked terrible, her eyes had huge bags under them, and her skin was pale. Her brown hair was disheveled and hung along her shoulders in uncombed strands. I peeked at my chest. The scars from my surgery so long ago had faded. I was awake, really awake. Nathan entered, giving me a disgusting wave of deja vu.

“You alright?”

“We’ve gotta stop meeting like this,” I said, trying to joke. He nodded, a grin on his face.

“She’s been here all day, the moment she heard she was by your side,” he motioned to Julia. I felt a slight annoyance, followed by the warmth of a person’s care.

“I’m surprised you were able to kill it,” he continued, “A Wendigo in your own basement. You had zero preparation.” A smile crossed his face, “Far cry from how you used to operate.”

“Only because of what you people did to me,” I didn’t mean them to, but the words exited my mouth filled with spite.

“It kept you alive, Jason,” he lit a cigarette and left the room, “And I’d do it again if it meant you were to become one of my top hunters.”

I leaned back into bed. My body was nearly healed. As much as I wanted change, I knew there wouldn’t be any. I would leave, I would kill, I’d return to their HQ and collect my bounty, and I’d repeat the process over again.

And I’d do that until I died.
