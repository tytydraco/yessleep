A family was spending a peaceful evening in their cozy home. The son’s friend was visiting, and they were all hanging out together inside.

The son suddenly grew uneasy. “I think I saw someone just fly away,” he said, clearly freaked out. But his parents tried to calm him down. “It was just your imagination,” they told him.

Later that night, as the family stayed inside, the father was suddenly startled awake by a scream. Alone and half-asleep, he dismissed it as nothing.

The next morning, the family and the son’s friend gathered downstairs, talking about their plans for the day.

While they were alone the father told the mother of the horrible noises he heard but said it must have been in his dreams.

The sons friend said he better get home since his family was expecting him. As the friend left out the front door, only the father remained inside while his family went out to the back garden.

Outside, on the front side of the house, the father saw the friend suddenly lifted into the air by a powerful wind. The boy screamed in terror, being sucked upward and carried away, out of sight.

Meanwhile, the son, his wife, and their young daughter were on the back side of the house, shielded from the wind. They heard the friend’s screams but were safe from being pulled away.

Soon there after, the wind returned with growing fury. The father watched through the window as his son was lifted sideways, caught in the invisible suction, his body helplessly dragged upward.

The mother instinctively grabbed both children, holding tightly to a pole anchored from the back porch ceiling to the ground, trying to keep them safe.

The father rushed outside, grabbing the pole to steady himself as he went to grab the children.

The son was holding his mother’s hand, and with the other, tightly clutching his little sister.

Just as the father reached to grab the son’s wrist, the wind suddenly ripped the children from the mother’s grasp.

Screaming, the children were swept away down the road, disappearing from view.

The father tried to chase after them, but the mother held him back, terrified of losing everything.

Suddenly, the wind stopped as abruptly as it had come.

The parents collapsed to the ground, crying and screaming in anguish.

The mother went inside, trying to coax the father to come in, but his fury erupted.

“Fuck you!” he shouted into the still air.

The wind answered with a terrible roar, seizing the father and dragging him up into the sky.

The mother’s screams faded as she watched him disappear into the distance.

The wind never came again and the mother was left alone. 

Years later she is a wreck that seems like a mad woman to the people who live in the  town closest to her old family home. 
The town residents all make and spread slanderous rumours about how she murdered her family.

She was never charged with anything by the police as they never found the bodies and after examination and tests it was evident she atleast believes the story, they possibly think the father ran away with the kids and this broke both her heart and her mind.

But when I seen her recently, the sincerety with which she told me what happened absolutely terrified me. When I told my mother she said she's just a sad woman who was abandoned and not to be afraid of her.

I told my mother I'd go up to her house and offer to help her out with stuff she'd need, maybe help fix up some stuff around her house.

A couple of days later I decided to go up and lend a hand with whatever I could help out with. She was very happy to have a visitor. I walked around the house asking what bits and pieces I could help out with.

Oddly she didn't seem too interested in the help but was feigning interest in help to have someone around for company. As I was walking around and talking to her we eventually got to the back garden.

There was a small pink child's slipper on the ground. I felt a lump in my throat as I imagined the pain she must have lived through all the years of having been abandoned not knowing what ever happened to her family or where they now live.

She looked at me and asked " you believe me don't you, the wind took my babies and the love of my life away". 

I looked her in the eyes and said "yes I do, I'm very sorry for what happened to you". She seemed somewhat comforted by this but I didn't really mean it.

When I was younger I believed the stories of her killing her family and the sons friend, I'd have never been brave enough to even come near her house back then, but now I was a large young adult toughened by helping out on locals farms and such. These days I just believed that her husband ran away for a better life with the kids and that the sons friend decided to go with them or ran away separately.

I heard her start crying, I noticed as we were standing out her back garden just near the door she was looking to my opposite side from her.

I looked and seen a metal rusted bar that was like a pillar coming up from the ground into the ceiling that overhung from the house to shade a little of the paved part of the back garden.

The bar was violently bent in one direction. I got chills but realised it was probably bent from years of weather, rust and a lack of maintenance, it didn't look like it was beaten into that shape just warped.

She said to me " I've waited out here each day since it happened, hoping and praying that the wind takes me away too, so I can be with my family".

We went back inside and she got a better mood, possibly from being away from the reminder of what she had been through.

I gave her my number, reminded her that she shouldn't hesitate to call if she needed help and she put it into her cell phone. I left as I was not just feeling sad for her but I was very spooked out. I went home as it was getting later and I had promised my mother id help out with dinner.

As I was making the dinner my mother and I chatted about our day and I told her everything that happened, we eventually sat down to watch TV with the rest of my family.

I was never an especially emotional or sentimental person but I remembered thinking how lucky I was to grow up with two parents who loved me, my younger siblings and eachother so much and it made me feel even worse for this poor old woman who was abandoned so horribly.

Everyone went to bed and I got to sleep pretty quickly since I'd had a pretty full day of helping people out.

I suddenly woke up and it was very windy outside, but that's not why I woke up. I was getting a call from someone, it was the old lady I'd helped a while ago.

I answered the call but all I could hear was a thud and that sounded like the phone sliding on the ground.

I was so tired I couldn't process this and hung up thinking the old woman felt lonely and wanted to talk but then forgot what she was doing and just dropped her phone. It took me a while to get back to sleep but finally I drifted away.

The next day I came downstairs and had breakfast with my family as my father who was a police officer told us his colleague told him and old lady in town had gone missing. I quizzed him on it and it was the old lady I had seen just the day before. He said it was like she had just disappeared.

I could feel every muscle in my body stand still in fear.

When I got the call from the old lady the previous day I was too tired to notice properly but it was extremely windy outside. I remembered the bent pole in her back garden and the singular child's slipper, that looked like it fell off a child's foot who just disappeared.
