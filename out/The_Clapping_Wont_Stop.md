I've never been much of a rule-breaker. 

Predictable. Boring, even. 

It kept me out of trouble as a kid, at least. "A pleasure to have in class'- that's how every yellow-slipped report card described me in looping cursive penmanship, year after year. Of course, neither of my parents ever reacted to the middling praise-  a satisfied nod and a steely-edged "Good" was all that could be expected. My brother, two years younger, spent most of our adolescent years playing delinquent in stolen cars all over town. My quiet acquiescence and "Yes sir's" were rewarded with the occasional red-pen compliment on an assignment, or a tight smile and a few bucks left on the counter for pizza while my parents went to bail my brother out again. 

Straight B's were good enough to let me coast through high school graduation, but my experience left me with few real prospects and even fewer friends. The only kid I'd considered myself close to (we had bonded over our shared tendencies toward acne and un-athleticism) moved to the East Coast for college, and despite my best efforts, his text messages had petered out after a couple of months. 

So, acting on auto-pilot as my eviction date from my parent's home grew closer, I got a job working the night shift at a call center the next town over. The extra pay for working nights made my existence in a sparsely-furnished apartment bearable, if not especially comfortable. 

It was only me working the night support line, so my daily existence went from quiet to invisible. I slept during the day and ventured outside only to take the empty bus to work; exhausted, I'd grab a sandwich from a 24/7 deli nearby and drive home in the dark, headlights illuminating the emptiness of the roads and sidewalks I passed. Beyond the robotic interactions where I numbly plugged the appropriate script to the odd customer, I floated through life hollow, invisible to the society I felt a member of only in name. 

The first time I heard it, I thought someone was mocking me. 

The day had been shockingly rainy, and as I waited for my bus in the downpour, I was already in a foul mood. Doing my best to point my cheap umbrella into the wind, I didn't see the car coming until a wave of cold, muddy water splashed onto me with a shock. The asshole drove off, chrome wheels spinning, water dripping from where he had purposefully driven through the puddle. It wasn't in my nature to be confrontational; being built like 140 pounds of play-dough shaped over a human skeleton will do that to you. But on that day, the freezing dirt clinging to my bottom half snapped something in me, and I fiercely waved my middle finger towards the back of Asshole's truck. 

That was it. Just simply flipping a guy off. Something people do every day, looking for a reaction. 

But that's when I heard it. The sound of a single pair of hands, clapping. Not a slow clap, like you'd do sarcastically, but an eager burst of applause. 

I turned in a frantic circle, searching for whoever had seen my uncharacteristic outburst. It had sounded not five feet away, but I saw no one under the glow of the streetlights. Before I could process what had happened any further, my bus pulled up, pneumatic doors opening with a hiss. *I'm just tired*, I told myself, sitting down, and the lonely night passed uneventfully. 

When I woke up the next day, I already wanted to hear it again. I had the day off to experiment with it, see what might trigger it again. Was it standing up for myself? I repeated positive affirmations in the mirror, and was met with heavy silence. Doing a good job? I cleared my email inbox, but I heard nothing. 

If you're wondering why I didn't question it further, then you've never been truly alone. I had no friends, barely spoke to my family- hell, I'd always been the last picked in kickball. The applause had made a small act of rebellion feel- special. Like I was special. It felt like some form of validation- I didn't care if I was crazy. Other people could decide that if they ever took an interest in my life. 

Work went on as normal. It had been a few days, and I had written it off as some one-time auditory hallucination. I unlocked the door and went to stash my few belongings in the cubby I shared with the day-shift worker who sat in my spot. It wasn't until I started sliding my jacket in that I noticed the lone $50 bill crumpled into the side of the shelf. I froze. I knew it probably -definitely- belonged to Samantha. Who worked at less than the salary I did, but with three kids to boot. But it wasn't like I was rich, either. I was 19 and barely getting by. I stared at it for a few more seconds before my phone lit up with a rare text message, as if on cue. 

**Samantha**: *Hey! Sorry to bother you, but I think some money fell out of my purse earlier in the cubby. Could you check when you can? Thanks!*

I considered for a brief moment. Too brief. At least she had a family, right? What did I have going on? 

I waited several minutes before I texted her back. \*No, I don't see it. Sorry\*. The message sent while I pocketed the bill. 

And for the second time, I heard the applause, this time an enthusiastic round in eerily perfect harmony, fading after a few minutes into the thin air of the empty office. I sat, frozen. I was taken back not only by the surprise of the sound, but the spark of curiosity that burned dangerously inside me. I racked my memory. I couldn't think of a time when people had clapped for me, outside maybe the polite clapping that comes at birthdays or my graduation. The applause felt... genuinely happy for me. Like it was proud I was standing up for myself. 

The next time, I actually wasn't alone. Technically. I had only had one query in the first six hours of my shift, but my hopes for a quiet night were shattered when a woman called in with a product complaint. Normally, I'd handle this fairly easily, but this lady seemed out for blood. None of my suggestions- replacement, different model, tech support, refund- seemed to placate her, and I honestly didn't know what solution she actually wanted. It comes with the job, right, but after almost thirty minutes of being berated, my composure was nearing its end. Finally, the woman shouted- and I had been holding my headset a good six inches away from my ear at this point- "WELL? Do you have ANY suggestions that might ACTUALLY work? If you want to be treated like a professional, give me some professional advice!"

I felt the tiny itch in the back of my brain. I wasn't *really* a professional, but *she* didn't know that. Actually, no one knew much about me at all. 

I placed the speaker back up to my mouth. "You know what, lady? I do have some professional advice for you. Go FUCK yourself." I hung up the call, heart racing, not waiting for a reaction.

But I got one. From nowhere, a deep, thunderous applause erupted from the air around me- like a standing ovation for a well-loved soloist. The percussion swept through my body in the warmest, most gentle of ways. I loved it. I craved the sound. 

After that, I figured out the rules pretty quickly. The applause- the 'audience', as I grew to think of it- liked *risk*. It didn't even have to end in consequences- I never did hear from my manger about the customer I swore at- but the more risk, the louder it was, and the better it felt. 

But there was only so much I could risk- it's not like my life was worth much gambling with anyways. 

The next day, I sought to experiment- what risk equaled what 'reward', so to say. But I chickened out of every thought that popped into my mind- I didn't want to seriously hurt anyone or risk serious jail time. I guess I still had some self-control left at that point. I settled for pulling on the car doors I encountered on my way to the bus stop that evening. It was enough for some light celebration, scattered applause sparking in my ears, but I knew I could do better. As I rode the bus quietly, faint shadows skittered in the corners of my vision. 

At home, the emptiness of the air around me was suffocating. I didn't dare try the car trick with the sun coming up, and the usual knot in my chest tensed with every pulse of my throbbing head. 

Frustrated and unable to sleep, I decided to give my apartment a deep clean- it needed it, if nothing else. The stillness echoed in my ears as I scrubbed the stovetop to a sparking polish, turning the electric stovetop on low to help me scrape off the residue of a poorly-placed tupperware I knew my landlord would kill me for. 

The silence was a restless force, and suddenly, I felt a demented, delightful pull toward the thing that every cell in my body knew not to touch. I know I wasn't thinking rationally then, but I remember thinking *it's not that hot, it probably won't even scar*. Dumb fuck, it was blistered for weeks. But the moment I placed my open palm on the hot stove, the searing pain was instantly accompanied by a chorus of raucous applause, the sensory input twisting madly through my brain in a symphony of warmth and invitation, even as I could smell my own burning flesh. 

From then on, silence became my active enemy, causing something inside me twist unbearably, impatient, desperate to be seen. Without my audience rewarding me, the air was thicker, colors were wrong, and shadows too deep. It became impossible for me to eat or sleep- but the audience liked that, too. *Good job. You're doing so well. This is the way*. The words weren't spoken, but they pulsed through my brain to the rhythm of invisible hands. I stopped going to work- it turns out being threatened with eviction isn't so bad when every angry call from my landlord triggered another explosive round of applause that gave me more satisfaction than that shitty apartment ever could. 

I knew it wasn't going to be enough forever, though. When every balance on a knife's edge is met with an adoring crowd, I wasn't about to step off no matter how many times I fell and cut my feet. 

Not that cutting feet bothers me now. There's a few of my toes swirling around the bathtub drain- the risk of blood loss and infection is intoxicating for me and my audience. A while back, my body started moving in time with the applause. At first it was a finger tapping, a foot bouncing. But as the rhythm overtakes my being, I feel myself thinning into a single beat among many, eyes blinking and breath catching in the same rising swell.

I didn’t decide to do it.

I don’t know when it started.

And now that I've noticed, there's a fragment of identity that screams to stop—but it feels too good not to follow, even if I have a choice.

The instant I fall into their rhythm, I know I will feel the last of me slip, making space for whatever will follow. Some part of me is already lifting away, unraveling into the echo that will outlive the person I was.

And I will give myself into the terrible beat, hands folded and upright, waiting give the next lonesome person a taste of the warmth that will never stay.
