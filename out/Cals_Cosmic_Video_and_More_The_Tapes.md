I miss movie rental stores. Of all the things that technology has taken from us, that’s one of the greatest losses. I’m biased, sure, since it was my first major job and helped me get through college, but come on, there was nothing like it, right?

Cal’s was a town institution, and I had been going there for years already by the time I started working there in 1997. I’m honestly amazed they hired me instead of banning me from the store outright, as much trouble as we caused back then. It was always a challenge to see who could sneak into the adult video room and shoplift without getting caught. Little did I know how much I would hate the stupid kids like me who did that.

It was definitely a product of its time, with a renovation every decade or so that really brought it into the uh… present. At the time, at least. Think it was ‘95 when the last update was done on the original store, and that was a neon nightmare that was trying way too hard to be cool. Not that it needed to be cool, considering it was the only rental place within thirty miles for our little nowhere town. Every weekend, without fail, this place would be full of families looking for the latest tape to entertain the kids, teenagers trying to pass off a fake ID for scary movies, and the occasional weirdo who was spending far too much time by the adult room. Yeah, those were a pain in the ass.

I got hired on in ‘97, summer before my senior year of high school. It wasn’t bad, all things considered, and beat the shit out of working the IGA market down the road. Pushing carts in the south Georgia summer wasn’t something I want to wish on my worst enemy, so getting to work in constant air conditioning was a godsend. Seriously, if I never push a fucking shopping cart through the heat of Satan’s musty taint, it’ll be too damn soon.

Sorry, back to Cal’s. I’m getting old and tend to ramble so… yeah, sorry. I started in ‘97, mostly just working during the day in the summer. It was good money for a kid at the time, and hey, it put gas in my car and gave me a way to meet people, so it wasn’t all bad. Things changed a good bit when we moved into the mall a few years later but… sorry, getting ahead of myself again.

Anyway, normal enough job for the most part, especially back in the days when home video was a booming business and video stores still had a place in this world. I would work days for the most part during my first couple of months there, but when school started back, I started getting put on the closing shifts. When I tell you this place was a whole different animal when the sun went down… I saw some weird shit.

Nothing started off too crazy. When I went to closing shift, my first night was mostly uneventful, though probably because I had Dustin, the assistant manager at the time, showing me what to do before I was left alone. Things were mostly the same as working during the day, except with the whole added task of locking the door when I leave now. Big responsibilities was how closing was sold to me, and woo boy was I… whelmed.

We went through the motions, taking the returns for the day, checking them into the system and inspecting to make sure everything was still intact. We had been renting videogames for a few years too, so it was typically up to us to check the cartridges at the end of the day and make sure they still worked. God, the PS1 release that year was a nightmare thanks to the new world of scratchable disks. People didn’t know how to take care of the damn things and they ALWAYS came back messed up.

First few nights of closing were fine. Dustin gave me the lowdown on what to expect working nights, regular customers, people to be on the lookout for, how to fix the tape rewinder in case it decided to eat a VHS, stuff like that. Usually we just ended up going through the drop-off bin and making calls about late returns, which were differing levels of pleasant depending on who got the call. Hell, sometimes you tell someone their copy of *Ghost* is three weeks late and they come up to the store to curse at you personally while throwing the tape at your face. Fuck you too, Miss Griffords.

Now, going through the drop-off tapes was… a varied experience. If you were around in the time of VHS, you know that they could be VERY easily recorded over. The even worse thing is that the recording could be at ANY point in the tape. That means we would have to throw every single tape in and watch on fast forward, making sure that nothing extra might be on the returns.

Some things were innocent enough, probably just mistakes by stupid kids. The occasional kids movie would cut off right in the middle, suddenly hitting a loud action figure commercial before going into an episode of Street Sharks or Beetleborgs. Can never miss those Saturday morning cartoons.

Others were uh… ranging in quality. I recall there being one copy of Homeward Bound that became a prized item of the shop, though it would never go up for rent again. There was a very attractive woman in town who decided to record a VERY intimate message for the manager who was in charge when I got hired. He was fired not long after that. The tape was treated as a holy relic though.

Then we started getting the unmarked tapes. I didn’t even realize it when going through the basket since I would just throw the stack of tapes into the VCR to check before putting them into the books. Hell, half the tapes were so worn down they couldn’t have the name read on them anyway. Assuming they weren’t already plastered over with a giant “CAL’S COSMIC VIDEO” alien sticker so people didn’t try to pawn them.

The first one… I’ll never forget the first tape. It was me, alone, on shift closing up on a Friday night. It was already a wild night, with one shoplifter trying to snag a copy of Final Fantasy VII and getting himself the cuffs instead. With how insane everything was and our ridiculous hours on weekends, it was well past midnight when I inally started going through the tapes. The usual suspects came through, tapes of The Lion King, Predator… Howard the fucking Duck for some god awful reason. It was the last one, and when I first popped it in I didn’t think to look at the title. I just went by what I saw onscreen, considering by now I could recognize half of the movies here by one frame. 

I put the tape in. At first I assumed it was a found footage movie, kind of like Man Bites Dog and Cannibal Holocaust. Blair Witch Project wouldn’t be out for a while, so it wasn’t a booming subgenre quite yet. We got obscure titles from time to time though, so I just figured it was one I may not have seen yet.

Except then, through the grainy static and tracking signal on the tape, Cal’s came into view. I could see the huge stupid neon signs, almost unintelligible in the shit quality it was filmed on. It was unmistakable though, and as it came closer I started to notice details. It was night time, and lights were on inside the store. As the camera got closer, I could make out a figure inside, standing at counter. 

It came right up to the glass then, gliding through the bushes outside to press as close in as it could without shattering the window. In the moment, I didn’t even think about it, I just immediately started mashing the eject button like it was an emergency call. I threw the tape, don’t ask me why, and it landed over by the new release section. Next move was calling the police, because at this rate I wasn’t ready to fuck around. 

On that tape, the figure standing at the counter was me. I would take it as some kind of prank or something from my friends later, but at the time it freaked me the hell out. It was filmed that night, with me wearing the same Night of the Living Dead t-shirt I was right then and there. Swear to god I was hiding behind the counter clutching a box cutter until the cops finally knocked on the door. Even then it was a minute before I could work up the courage to even exit my hiding spot.

They watched the tape, but wouldn’t believe me when I said I hadn’t noticed anyone all night. Supposedly it was just teenage pranks, trying to scare people as it got closer to Halloween. It was useless even trying to talk to them about it, even after they saw the damned tape. Assholes just left without even filing a report, leaving me alone in this neon bastion on the dark street. I was scared shitless. I left the video on the counter with a note, hoping it was as they said, just a prank.

The next day I was off, and didn’t plan on leaving my house unless I was dragged out. My plan went well… until around eleven at night when our phone started ringing. Mom was pissed, to say the least, thinking it was some girl calling around for me before I answered. Hell, she probably still believes that, considering I picked up and immediately got asked to come to the shop.

Dustin was closing that night. This dude is always about getting his shit done on time and getting out of there, so he was already going through the numerous returns for the night. He got the same kind of video, showing him standing at the counter, wearing the exact same outfit as he was right then and there. I guess he had read the note I left, because he was asking me if it was some elaborate prank. When I kept denying it, he finally believed me. The shaking in his voice gave him away, and considering he was relatively unflappable, that made me worry. This guy got held up at gunpoint for the register one day and didn’t flinch, so getting shaken like this was something.

What else could I do? I got in my car and practically sped down there, arriving not long after the cops. Surprise, surprise, they didn’t believe him either, instead just putting it up to the two of us pranking them now instead of each other. Assholes wouldn’t believe us until the even worse films started coming in.

I ended up hanging around and helping him finish out the night, because I was still freaked out from the night before, and if someone didn’t think I was crazy, then I was sticking by them. This creepy feeling stuck in the air all night, unease settling in as we checked the last few tapes, wrapping up and locking the doors before midnight rolled around. 

A couple of weeks passed, we didn’t get any more of the unmarked tapes, but both of us were pretty on edge, all things considered. It was later on a Wednesday night when things went straight to hell. 

We closed earlier on Wednesdays, so things weren’t so bad. Nine PM rolls around, we lock the doors and head out. Unfortunately it was that time of year when it would get dark early, so night time was well under way before I started going through the return bin. Going through, one by one, I pulled tapes from hard plastic rental boxes, pushing them into our VHS and making sure everything was still intact. Fast forward through the movie, see everything is good and unedited, then rewind and put it back in the returns pile for whoever opened the next day to put on shelves.

There, at the bottom of the bin, was an unmarked tape. This thing was full already when I came in after school let out. Three in the afternoon, sun shining bright in the Fall weather. Not that Fall weather was anything nice in the South, considering it was still a furnace outside. There was no way this thing was returned later than noon at the most. My morbid curiosity got the best of me though, pushing it into the VCR and hitting play.

Static took over the blue screen for a moment, the camera approaching from across the road this time. Bright lights glared through the window, bursting against the pitch black night of the film. The same single streetlight was flickering outside as they approached from the window on the opposite side of the store as before.

Me, again. Wearing the same outfit, a Nine Inch Nails shirt with the Pretty Hate Machine album cover on it, leaning over the counter and inspecting the television in front of me. Except the television was now showing… me. Me, watching myself on the tape. The small digital clock on the desk was visible from this angle, reflecting the time- 8:49 PM.

I looked over at the clock, though my eyes were shut tight for a moment before willing myself to actually see what it said.

8:50 PM.

I practically pulled the phone off the damn counter, yanking the cord as I picked up the reciever and fell to the floor, hiding behind the low counter. Above me the television showed my actions in real time, like I was watching security footage from an outside view. I didn’t even bother calling the cops, knowing it would be useless, instead punching in Dustin’s number.

”Hey, Dustin here, can’t come to the phone right now but I’ll return your call when I can. Thanks.” Followed by the long, excruciating beep. I was babbling into the phone, nearly in tears by what I was seeing. Yeah, there was technology for live broadcasts in the 90s, but not going from a film camera to a goddamn VHS tape. There was nothing on the television, no receiver plugged in, no antennae, this thing was solely for watching the tape returns. 

The tape was still rolling, a loud whine coming from the VCR as it did. Then it cut to a new viewpoint, switching from the brightly lit shop interior to a completely dark area, the surroundings unintelligible from the dark, grainy quality. 

Suddenly the entire frame lit up, a pillar of luminous fire coming from the middle of the screen. As the flames grew, I could make out a human figure enshrouded in them, letting the flames completely engulf them before the screaming began. Deep, hideous bellows as their skin began to bubble, all in one, static shot to see their horror.

”911, what’s your emergency?” I didn’t even realize I dialed the number, phone to my ear with the dial pad on the ground next to me. “Hello? What’s your emergency?”

I couldn’t even speak, the VHS player began to whine, tape speeding up as the person onscreen began to burn more fiercely, finally collapsing from standing to kneeling on the ground as their screams began to weaken. I heard the film get loose from the tape wheels inside, a mass of magnetic ribbons bursting forth from the machine as smoke rose from it. Even unplugging it didn’t stop the motor from running. As the screams faded onscreen, the image began to burn out from the destroyed tape, distorting in terrifying static on the television in front of me. 

By the time I came back to my senses, the operator was giving me a spiel about how false emergency calls were illegal. I finally found my damned voice, telling them I needed help down at Cal’s, my voice shaking the entire time. Know what the bastards said?

”Sir, we’ve had calls coming from Cal’s every weekend. This is the fourth one tonight alone. We’re done responding to these jokes.” The operator said. 

“The fuck do you mean fourth time?” I was yelling now, prompting the operator to start getting angrier with me. ”This is the first time I’ve called. Someone is out there watching me!”

”Well, that’s what your friends told us earlier too, but when our officers drove by there wasn’t anyone out there.” She responded, a no-nonsense tone coming in now. “Now, if you keep calling in these fake emergencies, we CAN take legal action.”

”Jesus, fuck you!” I said, slamming the receiver down. There was no telling if whatever left the tape was still out there. Dustin wasn’t answering, the cops couldn’t be fucking bothered to actually help people, and I’m stuck here in the middle of a dark street with no protection. 

Unable to get anyone out there, not willing to walk outside and risk whatever the fuck might happen, I stayed right there on the floor. The only thing that got me up was to rush over and lock every door in the shop, hoping to god that whatever was there didn’t already get in. Finally, a few hours later around midnight, the phone began to ring again.

I grabbed it fast, almost falling over the counter trying to answer.

”Please. Pleasepleaseplease tell me it’s you, Dustin.” I said, pulling the receiver to my ear. The only response was a cackle before the line went dead.

So, needless to say, that shook me even further. I finally stood in front of the door for a few minutes, hyping myself up to make the run to my car and get the hell out of there. Full-blown panic was taking hold at this point, with a hyperventilating, shaking panic attack just around the corner waiting for me. Assuming whatever was out there didn’t take hold first.

I hit the door hard, not even bothering to lock it behind me as I rushed out and made a beeline for my car. My stupid key fob wasn’t working, battery dead, so I was fumbling to get my key in the lock and get the hell into this crappy Pinto I saved money all last year for. Nearly tore the damn door off once the lock turned, ripping it open and diving in, desperately hitting the locks down as soon as I was inside. Before I could check anything, the engine was cranked and my tires were squealing on the pavement to leave.

The exit to the parking lot was blocked. One single figure standing right in the middle of the entrance from the road, dark shadows engulfing them even with my headlights hitting them directly. This thing was pitch-black, like a void that all light around it was being sucked into. Before I could think about the possibility of it being a prank or some hallucination my tired mind was playing on me, I hit the gas, ramming full speed through the thing like it wasn’t even there and turning onto the street. I swear to god… my car didn’t hit anything, but I swear I saw this thing standing right where my passenger seat was as I passed through it. It just stayed there, and as I drove off into the night, tears beginning to stream down my eyes in fear, it just turned to watch me leave like nothing had happened.

When I got home, I dashed inside and locked myself in my room. Mom was a little worried, but then just wrote it off as weird teenager shit. Think she assumed I was smoking pot and didn’t want her finding out. This woman was keeping the Satanic Panic alive well into the 2000s so she always assumed the worst.

Dustin finally called me the next day, and I didn’t even leave my room to try going to school. When I told him what happened it was like a weight lifting to know that someone finally believed me. 

When he went in next, he insisted to Pete (the manager at the time who would later get fired for the Homeward Bound tape) that we needed two people on closing shifts from now on. Considering Pete was getting a load of complaints about calls from the police station, he was reluctant at best. Dude wouldn’t give in though, insisting that we didn’t have the hours for two closers. After seeing how much we were raking in, that was definitely bullshit, but whatever.

Dustin and I made our own system then- when one of us would be closing, the other would show up when the sun went down to hang around.

It worked… for a couple of [months](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/B0s84M72iS).
