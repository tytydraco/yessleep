I grew up in south Alabama, near the Georgia line, as did my father, and my father before him. I was a fifth-generation farmer, and my family has owned land in Alabama since the mid 19th century. Growing up on the farm, the work was unrelenting, the heat my biggest adversary. From as young as I can remember, my mornings began before the sun even peeked over the horizon. The cool dawn air offered a brief reprieve, but as soon as the sun rose, the oppressive heat took hold. By mid-morning, the temperature was above 90 degrees, the humidity thick like a suffocating blanket. My clothes would be soaked through with sweat almost instantly, and every breath felt heavy, laden with moisture, heat, and dirt.

The work was physically demanding. I learned to use the cotton picker at a young age. I would feel the vibrations through my entire body, the constant jostling making my muscles ache. The heat in the air shimmered over the fields, and every adjustment I had to make on the hot machine felt like a battle against the sun. My back would protest with each movement, and my hands, though calloused, were always slick with sweat and dirt. By the time the sun begins to set, I would be covered with a layer of dust, grime, and sweat, almost like a second skin. My legs feel like lead from hours of standing and moving.

The days would all blend together in a haze of heat and hard labor, but there was a rhythm to it that connected me to the land and to my family’s legacy. The grueling work was tempered by the knowledge that I was keeping alive a tradition that has been passed down through generations. Despite the grueling conditions, and my own exhaustion, there was a sense of pride and accomplishment in keeping the farm running and contributing to something that’s been part of my family’s heritage for so long.

My favorite part of the day would be when the work was all finished. Down the road about a quarter mile was a small swimming hole everyone called Sycamore Creek, due to the large Sycamore trees that stood strong over the swimming hole, providing shade like natural umbrellas. Refreshed from my swim, I’d make the walk home and join my granddaddy on the front porch where he’d drink whiskey, and I’d drink tea; often out of a whiskey glass to imitate him. He’d tell me stories about growing up, and we’d often find ourselves cuttin’ up over stories of all the dumb trouble he and his buddies got into. We’d listen to bluegrass on his old radio and look over our fields with a cold drink in our hand. It was these evenings that reminded me why we busted our asses every day.

There was one evening though, where grandpa told me a different story. On this particular evening, my grandpa over-indulged on the whiskey. With the radio playing, an old bluegrass rendition of “Cotton Eyed Joe” came on.

“If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe,

I'd been married long time ago.

Where did you come from, where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

He came to town like a tornado,

And he stole my wife and he ran away.

Where did you come from, where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

He came to town, and he made a scene,

Got the women all riled up, and the men all green.

Where did you come from, where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

He left us all in a big old mess,

And we haven't heard from him since.

Where did you come from, where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe,

I'd been married long time ago.

Where did you come from, where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?”

For the first time, I saw my grandaddy get angry. He tried turning the radio off, turning the dial, hitting buttons, but his drunkenness effected his ability to figure the radio out. He eventually kicked his old radio off the small table it was sitting on. The action caused the radio to skip, and it began repeating the same phrase over and over again, “where did you come from Cotton-Eyed Joe, where did you come from Cotton-Eyed Joe, where did you come from Cotton-Eyed Joe” until my granddaddy picked up the radio, and smashed it on the front porch. I watched him, stunned at what I had just saw.

Breathing heavily, he took off his hat, wiped his brow, and sat back down.

“Are you.. okay?”, I asked. He didn’t answer. He sat, looking over the field, eyes darting back forth, still breathing heavily.

“Boy, I’m gonna tell you somethin’ I haven’t talked about in forever an’ a day. I’m gonna tell you about what happened to your grandmother”

“O…kay”, I said, starting to feel uneasy.

“I’ve told you a lot of stories, but the one I’m about to tell you needs to stay just between us, you got that?” he said.

I paused for a moment before replying, “okay”.

My granddaddy began to tell me this story:

“Let me tell you 'bout them days when I was just a scrawny teenager, runnin' 'round, full of mischief and dreams. Back then, our town was small enough that everybody knew everybody, and Saturday nights was what we lived for.

We'd gather at the old Smith family barn on the edge of town, that fallin’ apart ol’ thing. The place had a rough charm to it though, with the floorboards creakin' under our feet and the smell of hay and motor oil hangin' in the air. Me and my rowdy friends, we'd get there early, rollin' up in our daddy’s beat-to-hell trucks with tires that had seen better days. We'd crank up the radio and set up there for the night.

I tell you, them nights were somethin' else. We'd bring along a cooler full o' Cokes and, if we were lucky, a few bottles of homemade shine, and lay 'em out on makeshift tables. The girls would start showin' up just as the sun was settin', all dolled up in their sundresses with a sparkle in their eyes. We'd sit on the tailgates of our trucks, hollerin' at each other and laughin' loud enough to make the whole town hear.

Now, meetin' girls was always the highlight of those nights. There was one gal, Jenny, who had the prettiest blue eyes you ever seen, and she’d dance like nobody was watchin’. I'd try to impress her with my two-step and my best moves, though I reckon I mostly looked like a chicken with its head cut off. We’d spin around in the dirt, dust risin’ up around us, and every so often, I’d catch her laughin’ at somethin’ I said, and that’d be enough to keep me goin' for the rest of the night.

Us boys would race each other down the dirt roads after the barn dance, seein’ who could kick up the most dust. And when the fireflies came out, we'd gather 'round a bonfire, and tell tales of ghosts and legends we’d heard from one place or another. One of my buddies, Jack, told a story one night of Cotton Eyed Joe, who'd come to your house and steal your wife and daughters. We listened, and laughed, the smell of the burning wood and the crackle of the fire would made it feel like we were in our own little world.

As the night wore on, the stars would come out, blanketin’ the sky in a way you just don’t see in the city. We'd sit there, talkin' 'bout dreams and futures, the light of the fire reflectin' off our faces, our laughter echoing through the still night air. Those were the days when the world seemed simple, and all that mattered was havin' a good time with friends and tryin' to make somethin' of ourselves, one rowdy night at a time.

Sorry boy, I’m getting off track. Anyways, Jenny and I kept bumpin’ into each other at them Saturday night dances, and each time, it felt like we was learnin’ more ‘bout each other. We started talkin’ more, and she’d tell me ‘bout her dreams of travelin’ and seein’ the world, and I’d listen, starin’ at her with those big, blue eyes of hers. She had this way of talkin’ that made me think she saw the world through a lens of magic and wonder, and I reckon I was drawn to that.

One night, she and I ended up sittin’ on the edge of the old barn, watchin’ the moonlight on the creek. The air was warm, with the smell of honeysuckle, and the sound of the music and frogs croakin’. We talked ‘bout everything and nothin’ all at once, and before long, I was feelin’ somethin’ I hadn’t quite felt before.

I remember the first time I kissed Jenny. It was after one of those wild barn dances when the music had finally died down and the crowd had thinned out. We were standin’ by the bonfire, the embers still glowin’, and I turned to her, my heart racin’. I took her hand in mine, and she looked at me with those eyes, and I swear the whole world stopped. She didn’t pull away. Instead, she just smiled that sweet smile of hers, and that’s when I knew. From then on, we were together at the hip. We’d go out to the creek and talk ‘til the stars started to fade, or we’d just sit together, quiet, watchin’ the fireflies blinkin’ on and off. I’d take her out to the local diner where we’d share milkshakes and burgers, and she’d laugh at my jokes, makin’ me feel like the funniest fella on earth.

Sure nuff’, that summer romance turned into somethin’ deep and true, and it wasn’t long before I asked Jenny to be my wife. We got married in that same old barn where we first met, with all our friends and family gatherin’ ‘round, and I remember thinkin’ how lucky I was. Years went by, Jenny got pregnant, and we had your daddy. Life was damn near perfect, better than I figured I deserved.

Until that God damned night, that night that changed my life. Jenny and I had settled in for the night, your daddy sleepin’ in his crib. It was one of those peaceful evenings where the world seemed just right. We’d been married for a few years and had found our rhythm in the life we’d built together.

That night, we were sittin’ on the front porch, rockin’ back and forth in our old wooden chairs, the moonlight spillin’ over the fields, the crickets chirpin’ like they always did. Jenny was talkin’ ‘bout the little garden she wanted to plant come spring and sippin’ sweet tea from a mason jar, just enjoyin’ the calm.

I started to hear somethin’ ‘cross the field. At first, it was just a few crows, but they got louder and more frantic, like somethin’ had spooked ‘em. I looked out over the fields, tryin’ to see what might be causin’ the commotion, and that’s when I saw him—a figure standin’ tall and still in the moonlight of the field. Crows circled over top him. He was like nothin’ I’d ever seen before, an inhuman figure against the dark field. His clothes were tattered and his face was hidden in shadow, but there was somethin’ unnatural about him, like he didn’t belong. My gut twisted with dread as I tried to make sense of what I was seein’.

Jenny noticed my unease and squeezed my hand. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice tremblin’ just a bit. I told her I wasn’t sure, but there was somethin’ off about that man, and I didn’t like the look of it one bit. The crows kept cawing, their cries turnin’ more desperate as the figure in the field began to move toward us with eerie, unnatural movement. Jenny and I stayed still, watchin’ in horror as he drew closer, frozen in fear. The air grew colder, and the shadows seemed to stretch and twist all ‘round us.

As he got closer, I got a better look. His clothes were tattered, aged, old, almost like an old suit, hanging loosely from his lanky frame like cobwebs. His movements seemed smooth, like he was gliding rather than walking. He wore an ol’ bowl hat like my grandpappy used to wear on Sunday, ‘cept was old, ragged. As he got closer, I saw his face. It was like somethin’ I only seen in my nightmares. It looked starving, a mix of ghostly white and terrifyin’ stillness. His skin was pale as death, and stretched out taut over his gaunt skull. The wors’ part was his eyes, pure white, empty, soulless. His eyes seemed to suck the light from around him, shinin’ bright white in the night.

Then, without any warnin’, the figure raised a hand and began to beckon toward Jenny. The gesture was slow, deliberate, compelling, like a call. I felt a chill crawl up my spine as I watched Jenny stand up from her chair, drawn toward the figure as if she were in a trance.

“Jenny, no!” I shouted, but my voice felt weak and distant, lost in the the night. I was terrified, I felt like I couldn’t move, I couldn’t stop what was happenin’. I reached out to grab her, but she was already movin’ toward the edge of the field, her eyes wide and glassy, like she was in a dream.

I raced after her, but no matter how fast I ran, the distance between us seemed to stretch. The figure stayed facin’ me but seemed to be movin’ away with Jenny, watchin’ me with those white eyes. The field seemed to stretch before me, and I could see Jenny gettin’ farther and father away with that damn monster.

She turned around one last time and looked at me with a sad look on her face. Her lips moved, but no sound came out. Before I could take another step, they were gone—vanished into thin air, as if the ground had swallowed her up whole. I fell to my knees, callin’ her name over and over, but the only answer I got was the cawing of the crows that had now began to settle down. Nothing but the empty field and sound of the wind against the trees were left in that night.

I searched the fields for hours, callin’ her name, but it was like she had never been there at all. The lawmen searched, townsfolk helped, but no one ever found a trace of her. Your daddy went and stayed with my mama for a while, as I was too torn up to be a proper daddy to em’. I searched all over these parts, talkin’ to everyone I can about Jenny and that man.

One such day, I went to city hall, lookin’ through ol’ history books about the town. I found an event that happened right hein’ this town in 1847. One summer day, when the sun was settin’ low, a stranger wandered into town. Story goes he was a tall fella, wearin' a ragged coat and a hat that was all bent outta shape. But what really set him apart were his eyes—pure white. Folks was curious, but kept their distance, for there was somethin' about those eyes that set the hair on the back of their necks on end. The stranger didn’t talk, just stood in the distance out in a field.

Soon enough, word spread ‘bout this man who’d come to town, and the womenfolk, bein’ the gentle-hearted souls they were, started to take notice. They’d step out of their houses to get a look at the man. Well, once they all gathered, he beckoned each and every one of em’ one by one, nineteen women, some young, some old. They all wandered toward the beckonin’ of that man. Some even slipped outta their homes in the night, eyes glazed over and steps unsteady, as if they were in a trance. Their husbands and families, bless their hearts, tried to follow and bring ‘em back, but couldn’t. Nobody knows why, but they just couldn’t get to em'.

By the time the rooster crowed, those nineteen women had vanished, taken by the stranger with the white eyes. The townsfolk searched high and low, but it was like they’d just disappeared into the night. The only thing left behind was the distant caw of the crows.

Folks started callin’ him Cotton-Eyed Joe, after his white eyes of course. Some said he was a spirit sent to test us, others thought he was a demon meant to punish us. That’s where the song came from, ya see. Nobody knows really who made the ol’ tune, or where it came from, but God damn that song, Cotton Eyed Joe.”

My granddaddy began to cry, quietly to himself, then drift off, looking out into the distance. He knodded off on the porch and I sat, looking over the field. What was once a thing of beauty to me now held a sense of eeriness and dread. I waited for any moment to hear the sound of a crow or Cotton Eyed Joe to come out of that field.

I’ve looked all over for the origins of that old song. Its agreed it originated sometime in the 19th century, but nobody really knows by who, when, or where exactly. There are many versions of the song, some very old, some new, but to me, the words now hold something sinister in them.
