Hello! I'm writing this to ask for help with a project that me and my friend have been trying to chip at for a week now, to no avail. This is my first time writing in a forum, she said it may be a good way to find support. To save alot of people alot of time, I’m specifically looking for people with technical knowhow around computers, any specification is good. Thanks in advance.

So story time, I was out hiking last Friday around the base of this mountain in Alaska, lots of old growth there and stuff, and my trekking pole hit something peeking out the mud. It was definitely not rock, it screeched with this hard plasticy scrape that activated my hiker’s litter picking instinct. There had been an absolutely heralding storm last night that turned alot of the dry ground into temporary swamp and the Winter chill kept it that way. So whatever this thing was it's fully possible it had been buried here for a while and was just yesterday regurgitated from it's rabbit hole.

I cleaved all the mud caked around it with that trekking pole then reached down to truffle it from the cliffside, and a sixth of the cliffside came off with it. It was an absolutely gargantuan box, about the side of a small child split into two sides, half glass, half metal. The glass half had tiny holes that linked up with a polyester structure inside it like a beehive, the metal half was welded all the way shut. Thinking it could be a time capsule, I painfully carried it all the way back to my tiny smartcar which winced at it's weight. I did go on the rest of that hike, but afterwards I still had this thing on me. My friend that I mentioned works at a general repair shop for stuff like bikes but she herself works with computers, so she has access to powertools and I thought she would be a good candidate to open it without damaging whatever was inside. Yesterday she called me to announce she'd finally managed to do just that, the following description is partially transcribed from my memory of this call:

Quote, it’s a PC. The whole construction shows a proficiency with custom rigs to rival Terry Davies. The glass part’s an air filter, teched out to filter for water and debris too. The inside of the metal part looks like an H.R. Giger painting of an ouroboros, wires looping out from a retrofitted airplane’s blackbox and jumping through two processors on top of and under it of it and looping back into the blackbox. If there was a point in time where this thing worked, it would be a completely closed system both literally and figuratively. Of course infinity engines aren't possible, this one was probably slowly poisoned by a deteriorating quality of energy. But still, the fact it probably ran at all was a miracle. Whatever program it was running all this time buried in that grove, it could generate energy by being ran.

We’re going to be taking it to every relevant workshop within the county in the following week, I’m posting here in hopes of finding additional support. I will update y’all if we make any progress, until then.
