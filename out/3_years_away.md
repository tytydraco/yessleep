It was a bitterly cold January night, the kind where the world feels suspended in time, cloaked in silence and shadows. I was walking home, my footsteps echoing eerily on the empty street. Something about the night felt... wrong, though I couldn’t quite place why. It was the sort of feeling that tightens your chest, as if the air itself is watching you.

As I approached an old bench beneath a flickering streetlamp, I noticed a man sitting there. He was hunched over, clutching a cane, his silhouette barely illuminated by the failing light. His coat was tattered, and his hat cast a deep shadow over his face. The sight of him unsettled me, though I couldn’t explain why.

I hesitated but felt compelled to speak. “Sir, are you alright? It’s freezing out here.”

The man slowly lifted his head, and the light caught his face. My stomach dropped. His features were worn, etched with wrinkles, but I knew them. I knew them because they were mine. His eyes, those sharp, weary eyes, stared straight into me.

“What the hell...” I whispered, taking a step back.

He smiled faintly, a sad, knowing smile. “It’s strange, isn’t it? Seeing yourself like this.”

I froze, my mind racing. This had to be a joke, a trick. “Who are you?” I demanded, though my voice betrayed my fear.

“You already know,” he said simply.

“No... no, this isn’t possible,” I stammered, my breath fogging in the icy air.

He sighed, leaning on his cane. “I didn’t believe it either. But here we are.”

I wanted to run, to get as far away from this impossible encounter as I could. But something about his presence held me there, rooted in place.

“What do you want from me?” I asked, my voice trembling.

“To warn you,” he said, his tone grave. “You’re standing on the edge of a cliff, and you don’t even see it. The choices you’re making, the way you’re living... it leads to nothing but regret.”

I swallowed hard, the words cutting deeper than I wanted to admit. “What do you mean?”

He stared at me, his expression unreadable. “You’re wasting time. You tell yourself you’ll do better tomorrow, that there’s always more time. But there isn’t. You’ll keep putting off what matters—friends, love, your dreams—until it’s too late. And one day, you’ll wake up alone, wondering how it all slipped away.”

The world seemed to tilt as his words hit me like a physical blow. “I... I don’t understand. What do I do?”

His voice grew sharper, almost desperate. “Stop waiting. Stop being afraid. Fix what’s broken before it breaks you. Fight for the life you want, before you end up like me.”

The air around us seemed to grow colder, the shadows darker. “How do I know you’re real?” I asked, my voice barely audible.

The old man tilted his head, his eyes gleaming with something like pity. “You’ll know soon enough.”

Before I could respond, a sharp gust of wind swept through the street, and when I blinked, he was gone.

I stood there, my heart hammering, staring at the empty bench. And then I saw it. Scratched into the wooden slats, the words:

"Don’t become me. Change your fate."

My breath hitched as I realized there was more. Below the words were my initials... and a date. A date that was only three years away.
