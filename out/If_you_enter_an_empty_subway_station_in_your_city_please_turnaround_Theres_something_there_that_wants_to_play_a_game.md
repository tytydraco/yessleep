It's there. I know it's there. Waiting for me outside this room. Or is it in the closet? Wherever it is, I can feel it watching me from outside the room. It's probably waiting on the other side of the window. It sounds like pebbles are being thrown at it but it's probably that thing, bouncing its nail on the glass, tempting me to look. That's what it does. It drives you into a corner and waits on all sides, filling you with dread until you break. I still haven't seen it yet, outside that blood covered claw the first night. I’m trying to stay strong but I don’t know how much longer I can continue.   
I’m ready for this nightmare to end. I’m ready to end it myself but I'm not sure it would let me. To ruin the time it's spent slow cooking me in my own fear. I bet it would really piss it off. Who am I kidding? I need Nina back and this is the only way for that to happen.  
  
It didn't tell me the full set of rules that first night. I learned that a week after I decided to play this dreadful game. The first realization of how this game would be played was delivered by the mailman. It would have almost felt like a dream if it wasn't for the fact that Jaz wasn’t here anymore. Outside that I could have probably chalked up the night the game started to being some coked up fever dream. I fucking wish. Anyway, back to the mailman.  I have one of the mail slots that are part of my front door. So the mail man just comes up and slips the mail into my house. I remember my door camera chimed when Dave the mailman approached. I took a quick look at my phone and saw him readying a handful of mail to slide through the door. I left my office to go and pick it up.   
  
When I got to my front door I saw a stack of at least 20 envelopes with more coming through the slot at a terrifying speed. I yelled for Dave to stop but no answer. It kept going. One piece and then another, and another. I checked my phone and there was Jazs head, looking into the camera. I jumped and screamed, throwing my phone into the air. The mail continued to come through the slot. I ran towards the door and threw it open. It crashed against the wall. There was Dave, raising himself up to look at me.  
  
I yelled, "Dave, what the fuck are you doing throwing all that mail into my house?"  
  
He looked at me confused. "What do you mean?" he responded. I looked behind me. What was a pile of mail that went up to my knee just a moment ago turned out to be only a few envelopes. I turned my head back to face Dave. I must have had a wild look in my eye because his expression turned to one of slight concern and worry. "Are you okay, Mikey?"  
  
"Yea," I whispered, looking back towards the mail on the floor. I turned my head back towards Dave and presented a more calm expression. I took a deep breath and released it. "Yea, I'm fine Dave. Sorry about that. I didn't sleep much last night... I'm sorry." I closed the door as Dave was in the middle of telling me it was okay. I put my back against the door as I slid against it until it touched the floor. That was the first time I learned that the rules weren't as simple as that thing led me to believe. Over the course of several months and multiple haunts I learned it could do a lot of things. It can make you hear things and see things but it never chooses to do so in a blatant manner. It waits until you're vulnerable. In a regular everyday situation. It never wants you to feel safe again, so that's the first thing it takes from you, the safe everyday moments. Then when you trust those less, it goes deeper.   
  
We should have turned around that day, Jaz and I. The subway station was empty. We were the only two folks waiting for the train that night. There wasn't a bum in sight. Alarms should have been going off in our heads from that but we were too high to care or notice. We were waiting on a bench for the tram to pull in. We had just gotten done at the bar and Jaz and I were going to head to his dealers to get another 8 ball. We needed some more blow to keep the party going, even if it was just the two of us at the point. Jaz… he was an animal. Probably the worst influence on me but I needed a distraction from the divorce with Nina and if Jaz was good at anything, it was getting you into something that'd take you away from everything, free of charge. He was a trust fund baby and was always happy to have the company. Jaz didn't have much responsibility either so you could always count on him to be wasting his time away on drugs or some chick. If he kept a job down his parents kept the money flowing.  
  
I remember Jaz turning to me trying to show me one of the new flings that had been occupying his time. I remember looking over his head at a clock on the other side of the station. The time read 1:45 AM. For some reason at that moment, thoughts of Nina swept past my mind like a leaf in a gentle breeze. I don't know why at that moment. I don't think there is a reason, it just seemed to occur. Those thoughts would be a brief moment of peace before we heard its voice and our plunge into hell began.  
  
"Gentleman," a deep and overwhelmingly kind voice chirped out from behind us. The voice was so deep I felt a slight vibration run across my back. "How are you fine looking gentleman doing this wonderful night?" Jaz and I both shot each other weird glances before turning around. There was nothing behind us except open space in the station.  
  
"What the fuck was that? Did you hear that, Mikey?" Jaz asked as he stood up and turned to face the direction the voice came from. I stood up and faced the same way as Jaz.  
  
"Yea, I heard it too, Jaz"  
  
"Gentleman, please don't be alarmed." the voice chimed again, this time seeming to come from every direction. "I'm what you all might refer to as a spirit, a casper the ghost of sorts."  
  
"What the fuck is going on Mikey. I'm high but I didn't take any shrooms to be hearing voices and shit. Mikey, are you hearing this shit to man?" Jaz asked. He kept turning his head looking for the source of the voice.  
  
"Probably just somebody playing a fucking prank on us for their TikTok." I said, trying to talk my own nerves down. This was too weird. I was high but still had some senses about me. This voice wasn't coming through a speaker, it was too clear and too close, too direct. "Ha ha ha, real funny. We know this is a prank, now leave us the fuck alone." I expected that to be it. For someone to come out and own up to the prank. I turned around to face the tracks. I looked towards my right. The clock still read 1:45 AM.  
  
  
"Gentleman," the voice rang again with a firmer tone. "Sit down and please do hold your questions until the end." Before I realized it, I was seated back on the bench, my head facing towards the tracks. I looked to my right and there was Jaz, seated as well. His face looked like it was trying to let out a scream but his mouth wasn’t open. I went to say his name but couldn't move my lips. I... I couldn't speak. I looked above Jazs head again. 1:45 AM. My heart was racing. I tried to stand-up, to move my arms, to speak, anything. It was useless. I could feel the terror radiating off of Jaz and combining with my own. I don't know how long we stayed like that, screaming with our mouths shut, eyes bulging. The clock would only show 1:45 AM. After a while the terror slowly faded as we realized there was nothing we could do except sit in silence.  
  
  
"Good," the voice said, "I see we've calmed down somewhat. So please allow me to explain." A loud stomp came from behind us. Another came, and then another.  It was that thing was moving around the bench. The crashes continued until the last came in front of Jaz and I. You know how someone can place their finger an inch in front of your forehead and not touch you but you can still feel it. That's how it felt having this thing in front of me. Hot breath bellowed down on my forehead. It smelled terrible. Like the stench of death and decay from long expired meat left out in the heat. Like roadkill left to rot.   
  
"The reason you're not dead yet is because I like to play with my food before I eat it. The fear your species can build up produces such a unique taste in your muscles. All the beings I've devoured throughout my time here, fear does something to you alls meat that...", it sighed heavily, the smell intensified to a point I thought I'd vomit in my mouth, "makes it quite a unique delicacy. I've enjoyed your species run here on Earth. I'm hoping you don't wipe yourself out like the others. I'd miss you all so much. I'd just die if I had to eat those overgrown lizards again." I tried so hard to move. I thought my bones would jump out of my skin at any moment but nothing. "As I've eaten your species over the last millenia or so I've honed my culinary skills to the point I've learned how to fill you all with enough fear that I don't need to eat for quite some time. You know when you think about it, you all should feel very special to have been chosen as my meal this time. It's been almost 100 years since the last time I've eaten so you may have the opportunity to join a very small list. Well, small is relative, isn't it.", The thing chuckled. I looked towards Jaz. Tears were running down his face. His head kept shaking as if he was screaming at the top of his lungs, trying to get a sound out. I imagine I might have had a similar look on my face. Wide eyes and a face swollen from holding in screams. I looked past Jaz towards the clock. 1:45 AM.  
  
"If you noticed, I said 'may' have the opportunity to join that very rare list. I am a fair being if not a hungry one and I've learned that providing hope does make the meat that much sweeter so I will allow you to make a choice. You play my game and have the opportunity to write your own destiny or, I let you go and wipe your memory of all that has transpired tonight. There's no point in wasting good meat. There's other beings out there that feed off you things too and killing for the sake of killing has become somewhat taboo. Now I will give you the opportunity to speak-" I screamed for help, or at least tried to, my lips were still sealed by an invisible force, "but, before I do I will give you fair warning. If anything outside your mouth is not a ‘Yes'’ or ‘No’, I will kill you on the spot. Now give me your answer.”  
  
Mike let out a terrified shriek. It sounded as if all the screaming he'd done while that thing was talking came out at once. He didn't stop. He screamed and kept on screaming, even as his head was slowly pulled upwards, more and more. He continued screaming even when the skin around his neck started to pull apart like threads of yarn being separated. He screamed even as blood filled his esophagus and his spine became visible. The pitch of his screams increased as I imagine his vocal cords began to stretch and tear. Then, the screaming stopped and his head was fully separated from his shoulders. His blood continued to spurt everywhere. I stared at what used to be my friend's head but now I was only looking at the clock across the station. 1:45 AM. I turned my head away from my friend and looked towards the tracks in front of me. My mouth tasted like iron. I looked down at my shoes. They were covered in blood. So were my pants. I wiped my mouth off and looked at my hands, blood too. I realized that my mouth must have been open the whole time. It was Jazs blood I was tasting. I looked back over at his body which had fallen to the ground. I looked up to see his head floating in the air. A blood soaked hand with long sharp nails dug into his face. His eyes were wide and mouth was still open as if he was still screaming.  
  
"Your answer?", its voice chimed again.  
  
"My what?" I thought. My answer. What does he mean? My brain started to process what was occuring again. My answer to whether I'd play a game or not. What kind of game would this be? What happens if I say no? So many questions rushed through my mind. I brought my head to my hands which were sitting in my lap. What is going on I thought. What the fuck is going on. Tears began to run down my face.  
  
"I'm losing my patience. I have a very good feeling you have the potential to provide me with a good meal so please listen carefully. This game that I want to play is quite simple. I will reveal myself to you only once. You will not know when this moment is coming. My goal is to make your heart stop upon my reveal and devour you there on the spot. You can liken it to shucking a fresh oyster before you eat it. However, should I reveal myself and your heart not stop, well then I will grant you one wish within the realm of reality."   
  
I looked at Mike's still floating head and followed the bloody claw upwards towards where I imagined the head of this monster to be. Nina flashed across my thoughts again. "Any wish?" I asked, my tears starting to subside.  
  
A deep chuckle seemed to fill the station. "Yes, any wish within the realm of reality."  
  
"What happens if I say no?"  
  
"You forget everything since time has stopped and this conversation becomes a future nightmare for you to relive. Though I cannot bring your friend back to life so that would require some explaining to, oh what do you call them? That's right, authorities.", it seemed to sound out the word as it spoke and ended with another deep chuckle. "Plus Mikey, you weren't planning on staying around on this earth much longer were you? I could smell the stench of death on you from very far away. You were going to kill yourself. I may be evil but I do like a good meal and you Mikey, would make a fine one." It dropped Jazz head and began to lick the blood from its claws. The cleaning off each claw was followed by a disgusting slurp, as if it was making sure to clean its fingers of any remaining saliva.  
  
It was right. I was going to blow my brains out once the divorce was complete. I'd been calling Nina non-stop with no answer. I went to each divorce meeting hoping to see her there and explain things, only to find her lawyer present in her place. The chance of being able to see her one more time was the only thing giving me hope, holding me here. And now this thing was telling me I had that chance to not only see her, but have her love me again. What did I have to lose? I said yes. My agreement was met with a laugh that seemed to shake the foundations of the station.  
  
"Good Mikey, good. Don't you worry about the body here, I'll take care of it. It should make a good appetizer for the meal that's to come. I look forward to playing this game with you Mikey. Please do not disappoint. Jazs head began to float again with his body following soon after. I looked towards the clock. 1:46 AM. I looked down to my side, there was no longer blood on the floor. I looked at my hands, no blood there either. I stood up and looked around, Mikey's floating body was nowhere to be seen. I heard the train begin to roll into the station, screeching as it braked, and then the doors sliding opened. I stood up and boarded. As the train departed and I began my journey home, I couldn't fight the feeling that it was there, looking at me, with a smile on its face.  
  
  
So here I am, trapped in a corner with no way out. I can hear its chuckle coming from outside the door. I just can't be afraid right? I just need to stay strong. If I know it's there then what could it do? Fuck, there's a knock coming from my front door now. It's… it's Ninas voice. What is she doing here? Why the fuck is she here now. It's playing with my head again, it’s gotta be. I… I need to go and make sure it’s not her. I’ll try to give an update here later. I don’t plan on becoming a meal for this thing. Not today at least.
