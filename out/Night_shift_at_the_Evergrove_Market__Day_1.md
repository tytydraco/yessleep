My first shift at the Evergroove Market started with a paper sign:

"HIRING!! Night Shift Needed – Evergrove Market"

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just thought, “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

I would.
