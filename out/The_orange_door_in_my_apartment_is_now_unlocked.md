Hey Reddit,  
I don’t post much, and I don’t know where else to put this. I’m shaking while I type this, and I’m not sure if I’m losing my mind or if something really, really bad is happening. Maybe both.

I live in a small apartment above a pawn shop. It's old—like 1920s old. Creaky wood floors, weird plumbing, walls thin enough to hear the guy next door fart in his sleep. It’s cheap, though, and I’ve lived here for almost a year with no real problems.

Except for *the door*.

In the hallway between my bedroom and the bathroom, there’s this door that’s not like any of the others. It’s painted this horrible, bright *orange*. Like traffic cone orange. It looks out of place—like it doesn't belong in this decade, or even this building. The landlord told me when I moved in that it’s “not part of the lease” and to just ignore it. Locked tight. No key, no knob on the inside. Just there.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. I figured maybe it was some old maintenance closet or sealed-off stairwell. But then I started noticing… stuff.

The doorknob would twitch. I’d walk by and swear I saw it *move*, just slightly, like someone brushing it from the other side. Some nights I’d hear faint knocks—soft and fast, like fingertips. A few times, I heard breathing. Not loud. Just a low exhale, like someone standing really close to the door, waiting.

I told myself it was old pipes or air drafts. I even recorded audio one night to try to prove it to myself. I caught three knocks—clear as day. No pipes make that sound.

Then the dreams started.

I keep dreaming that I’m standing in front of the orange door. It’s always night, always quiet. The hallway behind me stretches way too far—impossibly long and flickering with buzzing ceiling lights. In the dream, I never move. I just *stare* at the door. It pulses like it has a heartbeat. Every time, I wake up just as the door creaks open.

Until last night.

Last night, the dream went further. The door *opened*. And something stepped out.

It was tall. Way too tall. Its limbs were bent backwards, like it didn’t know how to be human. Its skin was paper-thin and gray. Its face was smeared with shadows and something that looked like teeth. I couldn’t move or scream—I just stood there as it leaned forward and *whispered*:

**“It’s your turn now.”**

I woke up in my apartment, standing in the hallway.

My hand was on the orange doorknob.

And it was *unlocked*.

I didn’t open it. I ran. I’ve been crashing on my friend’s couch ever since. I told him something came into my place. I didn’t tell him about the door.

But now I’m dreaming again. Every night. The hallway. The orange glow. And the door is wide open now. That thing isn’t there anymore.

But I can hear it walking around my apartment.

I haven’t been home in three days. But I just got a notification on my phone from my security cam—the one facing away from my door. 

It says:

**"Motion detected – 2:14 a.m."**

I opened the clip.

All i saw was something orange walking away from my door.
