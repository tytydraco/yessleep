I really shouldn't be writing this but at this point I don't think it matters. Most of you will hate me for this. The police already know, some of them were there...

Last night I joined the Illuminati.

Yes that Illuminati. 

To the skeptics all I can say is this is much much more than a 'conspiracy theory', you can choose to believe my account which I will now tell you or not. It makes no difference to me. I have much greater worries now, we all do...

I don't really know how to start, mostly due to the shock but also my intense shame. As I said the police are involved, including but not limited to other prominent members of government, businessmen, and celebrities. I know it sounds batshit insane, but I'm speaking from firsthand experience. This isn't something I read about in some 'echo chamber', this is reality.

So how am I involved? I never came from much, I was raised by my mother and was barely middle class. For me, the most important thing in life has always been music. For the last decade, since I was little I have been writing and preforming music. I  had some buzz but still hadn't had a break out success... that was until recently.

I had just got home from a small show, it was terrible. Nothing went well, the promoter left without paying, the crowd wasn't into it and I couldn't stop messing up. It was midnight when I got in.

I sat in the kitchen and put my head in my hands defeated. What was I going to do? If my music didn't take off I had nothing; no skills, no talent, and no prospects. I would spend my life working 9-5 stocking produce if I was lucky.

My mom came down the stairs.

"Honey... what's wrong" she said putting her hand on my back.

"Mom, I'm ruined. My music, it's terrible... I'm never going to make it"

"Listen..." she said looking at me with concern.

"Everything will be fine. You'll figure something out. So what if music doesn't work out? I'll support you in whatever you do?" she said with a soft smile.

"Mom, I have to do music. You don't understand. It's my life!" I was broken at the realization it would never really work out. None of the small accolades mattered, a couple million views, a song on the radio, none of it would amount to the level of superstardom I had always dreamed of.

"I..." my mom paused and stood up, her hand on her chin. She paced back and forth as if thinking deeply. Then she spoke.

"I always wanted to bury this part of my life. I wanted to shelter you from it... from them" she said staring out the window. "My parents, my family... they are very... very wealthy" she said sighing.

"Your parents? Mom... I thought you were an orphan from New York. Rich!? What are you talking about? We're not well off at all?" I said in disbelief.

"I never lied to you. I am from New York... but we moved around a lot: Los Angeles, Tokyo, Paris. I left my parents. In a way they *were* dead to me. I never wanted you to have anything to do with them. They... they are not good people. " she said

I was stunned. What the hell was she talking about? "Mom..." I could hardly speak.
"I provided you everything you ever needed. I never wanted to you to live in the opulence I did as a child. I did the best I could."

Memories returned to me; Christmases and birthdays. Somehow Mom always able to give what I had asked for. Summer camps and music equipment... she always found a way.

*"I put in an extra shift at work" "I'll find the money somehow"*

I was spoiled and hadn't even noticed... that's where the money came from. How wealthy were these people? Were they that bad that mom had lied to me my entire life just to keep me from them? This whole family I knew nothing about? I wasn't mad, I wasn't upset, I was just numb.

"I'm sorry dear" she said earnestly "The reason... the reason I'm telling you is because... your Uncle. I think your Uncle can help you." she said it quickly like thought of it disturbed her.

***

A week later I was living in Los Angeles. I couldn't believe it, it didn't feel real. My mom had told me my uncle had looked over my music and was willing to fly me and my manager to L.A. He had accommodations and would put us in touch with some people in the industry that could help take my career to the next level.

To be honest I didn't see much of my 'uncle', he was a busy man. I did visit a few times when he had a few hours to spare, he arranged a driver to bring me to his 'villa' a few hours out of the city.

He talked about how 'our' family had built an empire of commerce over the last two hundred years. Now they had businesses in every industry imaginable. I exchanged pleasantries with my cousins but they only stayed briefly apparently also extremely busy.

His home like nothing I had seen before. He had servants, cooks and security. Multiple expensive vehicles. A boat. An art gallery and a library; filled with rare and exotic works.

I told him what I wanted to achieve with music and how hard I had worked for years. He listened intently as the servants brought out a variety of dishes. To me it was somewhat of a spectacle, but the man acted as if having a array of servants dote on his every whim was completely normal.

He said he was certain he could help me achieve my goals. He lamented about how my mother had distanced herself from the family, and was glad that he was finally able to meet me. I thanked him for having me, and to my surprise he had his pilot helicopter me back to the city that evening.

It was unreal. I had heard of rags to riches, but his was like something out of a novel. Of course, my own bank account didn't reflect the wealth that I just been surrounded by but my Uncle assured me that I would be taken care of in time. He *knew* my music would take off. To me it sounded less like he believed in the music (*which he had hardly heard*) and was speaking it as if it was a simple matter of fact.

***

After I met with my uncle big things started happening. The people he had arranged for me to meet with and I, really hit if off. They loved the music and said with the right producer and image it could be huge. I spoke to several A&Rs and they all told me they would be sending offers my way.

Several of my songs and socials really started blowing up. Back home I was a little successful; a couple million views, headlining a small local show. This was something else.

*If I told you guys who I really was... well some of you might even be fans of my songs.*

My manager though... he was seriously starting to annoy me. I guess he realized that I didn't need too much of his help. I kept him around because we had known each other for a while but he always complained and brought the mood down.

We were in the studio with one of our favourite artists. The whole time I was starstruck, we were totally vibing and had tons of ideas flowing. For some reason Scott, my manager got really pissed off. He was happy to be there at first but I guess he started to feel left out. The artist who we were working with suggested something and suddenly Scott blurted out...

"That's a dumb f-ing idea. Pop garbage. We're **not** going that route"

I was fuming... I looked at him incredulously. The artist (who by the way had multiple platinum records) looked really annoyed.

"Scott. Shut the hell up. Let us cook bro... you know what... Maybe you should head out?"

I felt bad because Scott had been there from the beginning, but there was no way I was gonna mess this up. I could see in his eyes he was hurt.

"Go... Scott. Bye."

"You're telling me to leave?" he said in disbelief. "F-you!' he said as he slammed the door behind him.

"Dude's a lame" the artist said disdainfully.

"Yeah... yeah whatever. I don't know why he got like that. We're both big fans. I thought that was a great idea." I said trying to redirect the conversation back to the music.

We eventually finished the song and recorded it the same night. It was a hit, we both knew it.

That night I went out with the artist (actually from this point I'll just call him CJ), that night I went out and partied with CJ. We went a few clubs and I met a bunch of people. All night CJ was telling them how 'heat' the record was and how 'I was up next'.

'Word?' some of them said.

By the end of the night I had the numbers of a bunch of people and artists that wanted to collab. I told some I was in town visiting my uncle who some of them recognized. They seemed to change once I told them... the guys were friendlier and a few of the girls asked if I wanted to hang out. I can't remember much after that.

***

The next few weeks went by in a blur. Scott was seemingly more distant and more bitter as I hadn't spent any time with him. He was constantly petty and annoying. I could tell he must have felt left out, but it's not like I had thrown him under the bus... at least not yet

The single I recorded with CJ was doing really well. I spoke to one of the A&Rs who said he had heard the track and they were prepared to make an offer. I was absolutely elated. I thought of calling my mom but thought it could wait. I had been sort of avoiding her, still bitter she had lied to me all that time.

Instead I got a call from my cousin.

"Well! Hello superstar" he said chuckling

"Hey! Good to hear from you! This place has been amazing. I really can't believe it. Thank you guys so so much for your help. This is exactly what I needed to get to that next level and I really think it's going to happen because of you." my gratitude was genuine.

"Right, right, well that's what family does." I heard him pause.

"Now if there's one thing this family believes in, it's tradition" he said.

"Okay..." I said sensing he was leading to something

"There is an event happening this weekend. Out of the city. Let me speak plainly... this family, our family" he said punctuating the last point *"our family"*.

"We are not a weak people. This is the foundation of our success. The world eats the weak and the strong survive." 

"Are you strong?" he asked me. 

I was starting to get uncomfortable..."Uhh...?"

"I already know the answer... the answer is yes. Why? Because you are one of us. This event is extremely important to us, do you understand? You will be asked to do something at this event, and I want you to make the correct choice. Prove to me you belong to this family" his voice was no longer bright as it had been moments before, now cold and assertive.

What was it they would ask of me...?

"What... what do you..." he cut me off.

"I know you'll do the right thing. You have the same blood in your veins. Don't disappoint me, don't disappoint us. I'm rooting for you too you know."

"I have to go. I'll see you this weekend. Well... *I'll see you* at least" his voice trailing.

"I have to go." the line went dead.

***

All week all I could think about this event. What was it my cousin was talking about?

Scott was distant as usual, at least until Friday rolled around. He seemed more upbeat and positive. When I asked him he told me...

"You're not the only one making it in this town! I got invited to a party as well."

"Woah, congrats Scott. That's great." I thought the fact we we're both going to parties on the same night was a little odd but L.A. was a big town.

I dapped Scott up as he left and started getting ready. My cousin told me I didn't need to dress up, it wasn't black tie. I was still feeling uneasy about this. I decided to text my mom.

"Hey mom, love you. Call you sometime this week."

Once again transport was arranged for me. I had never been into cars for some reason but I recognized this one from some music video. The driver opened the door for me and I sat down. I was silent the entire drive. I don't think the driver cared.

"We are here Sir" he said.

I looked out to where we had stopped. The middle of the woods, off the highway. A well lit path of lanterns leading to who knows where.

"Here?" I said

"Yes, sir, just down the path I presume"

I thanked him and got out of the vehicle and started down the path. After a minute or so I came upon a gate and a security booth. A man in a white drama mask and gloves looked my way.

"Hi.. I was told there was an event here I was to go to..."

"Name...?" he said his voice like a creaky door hinge.

I told him my name (which I'll omit here of course) and he handed me a small wrapped bundle. It was a gown and mask.

"Thi.. this?"

"Your attire sir" the man said as he opened the gate for me.

I awkwardly put the garb and mask on my face. It was so uncomfortable. I wondered if was this some kind of early Halloween party. Is this how the rich spent their time?

I put on the attire and made my way down the path. I was shocked at what I had seen. A large group of people all dressed in similar garb as myself were mingling. At the forefront was a large pedestal with an ornate mask-less woman on a throne. She looked gleeful and was speaking with a man in metal armor beside her. She had a spear in one hand and a finely crafted crown on her head.

"The man... of the hour" she announced gesturing to me as everyone began to clap.
"What the fu-" I said under my breath.

The people around stood in formation around the pedestal which at the base of the steps was a large stone table. There were here for me? I started getting anxiety. I didn't even know these people and I was in the middle of the woods in a robe and mask.

The woman on the podium spoke...

**"Today we gather, when autumn fall showers, adorn the ground in all the power..."**

I tuned it out. *What the f- was going on?* The people around me seemed mesmerized by her. Why was she different from the rest? It's like she was glowing. Who was the armoured man beside her? Her clothing looked like something from olden times, ancient Roman armor... something about her was inhuman...

"THIS, is the task of MINERVA..." she said as she slammed her bejewelled sceptre to the floor. Her voice proud as the people around stood silently.

Suddenly I heard a something from the shadows. A man was being carried through the crowd his voice muffled. They bound him to the table and removed the gag.

"Let me go! Help me!" he yelled.

Suddenly I felt like I had been hit by a train. The one on the table, it was Scott...

Just then a darkened figure approached me. He nodded and led me by my arm to the the slab where Scott was still screaming. He gestured to a pillar near by, on top was a crimson dagger and a mace, there was also a large wooden lever connected to some mechanism.

The figure stared at me, I could sense his intensity, though he wore a mask.
"Do not disappoint me..." I head the voice whisper.

I stood there shaking. This... what what was this...? Was this really happening? I looked to the assortment of weapons and back at Scott who was still yelling. He had no idea I was there. I felt dizzy and tears began to well. The wind in the trees was rustling. It seemed like every one was staring at me waiting, waiting to see what I would do. Waiting to see, if I was...

***One of them.***

I thought of all of my dreams I had had has a child and the experiences of the last few weeks. I remembered how Scott had been a rude ass for most of it... I couldn't believe it, was I actually thinking about doing it? 

*"He's a weight on me"* a voice in the back of my head said. I couldn't believe I was actually considering this... the pressure was immense.

I started to... then pulled my hand back. I paused and then placed my hand on the lever. I had no idea what it did, but it had to be better than the weapons. Maybe it would let him go? I stood there for what seemed like minutes.

"Eh-hem" a sound from beside me. A hand pointing to the lever. "Do it..." he said. I looked at the wrist of the man pointing. That watch... it was one of a kind. The man standing beside me... it was CJ.

I closed my eyes, and felt the muscles of my arm contract. I heard a scream and then a slam. The sound stopped. I opened my eyes and looked at slab Scott was moments before. He was gone, in his place a large stone slab... blood oozing out the sides.

Scott... Scott was dead. I had killed Scott.

The woman on the throne began laughing hysterically.

"Well done! Well done!" as she began to clap with a maddening fervour. The people around started clapping with her, as if I had just done something remarkable... and not ended the life of one of my closest friends. 

CJ grabbed my hand in both of his to shake... I could see the one from earlier clapping near the base of the podium, presumably one of my family members.

What happened next I don't think anyone there will ever forget.

Suddenly the wind began to grow from a rustle. Something was happening. It was like a typhoon was forming. It began to hail; hail like I had never seen. Then we all saw a flash of light. Lightning struck one of the tree beside us. The thundering boom was immense.

The woman on the throne became extremely distressed. She looked in pure dread to the sky. Her body contorted. She cried out, the scream unnatural.

Everyone ducked and covered their ears.

"YOU WIC-KED MEN!" she bellowed as if in pain.

"YOU SERVE A COUNT-ER-FEIT QUEEN" almost as if she was speaking against her will.

"ALL OF YOU ARE IN DAN-GER OF DE-STRUCTION. REPENT! YOU, IN DANGER OF WRATH!"

She threw her staff down and whipped the crown on her head to the ground. The horrific scream continued. A black light began emanating from her while she shrieked and she began to dissolve into thin air, into the blackness of the wood. The ground began to shake.

"What on earth" a voice shouted...

People began to run and topple over each other. Trees boomed as they hit the ground.I looked around for CJ or any of my family members but they were gone. I started to run as fast as I could. A few trees almost fell on me and I think they hit a few others. 

(*If you notice a few high profile deaths in a few days due to mysterious circumstances... you now know what happened.*)

I made it to the road. The car was gone. Expensive cars speeding and nearly crashing away from the scene.

***

A car pulled up beside me. "Get in!" it was my cousin.

"What the f- just happened" I said as I jumped in.

"I DON'T KNOW!" he said shouting at me. "You think that was part of it?!" he said fuming.

"Damn!" he said pounding the steering wheel. "I.. I never thought she was real... I thought it was a joke. Like symbolism or some shit" he said sweat on his forehead. He started laughing to himself somewhat unnervingly, like what we had just witnessed was comical.

"She... she said... we were WICKED men... right after I killed... killed Scott"

"Scott? Oh the offering... I mean, pfft yeah so... so what?"

"But she had like powers or something? It's like... it's like she was compelled... to tell us. She looked scared or something..."

"I'm a killer now! I'm guilty!" I yelled.

"Shit... shit ain't we all though?" he said speeding through the woods.

"What... no!? Do you think this is normal?" I said yelling

"IT'S SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. THE NATURAL ORDER" he yelled back at me.

"THAT... THAT, DIDN'T SEEM SO NATURAL!" I felt like I was going insane.

He said nothing in response. We drove in silence for the next hour.

"Well... you're in now. Your one of us." he said breaking the silence.

"In what..." I said.

"The family..." he said, his voice like slate.

He pulled into a dinner and turned to me staring. I wasn't sure what he was going to say next.

"I'm dropping you off here. I'm sure you can find you're way home."

I said nothing and got out watching as the lights of the red performance car sped off into the night, engine roaring. I felt the phone in my pocket vibrate.

***Mom calling. Mom calling. Mom calling.***

I couldn't pick it up...

***A text***: "Hi honey I hope you are doing well! I know LA can be a little rough but you're a tough one. Call me when you have time..." I felt like I would never be able to speak to her again after what I had just done.

I sat down in the diner and ordered a coffee. Hands shaking, the waitress looking at me wearily. I sat in the corner and told her I would just like to be left to myself for a while. She seemed to understand. I called a ride and made my way home.

When I saw Scott's things, I felt sick... he was gone... he was gone and I was responsible. It hit me like a ton of bricks.

I was guilty. I was a killer. I was "IN DANGER OF DESTRUCTION"...

I heard that evil voice echoing in my head for the rest of the night.

This morning I woke up and checked my phone. I had a message from the A&R, he told me he had gotten the go ahead from his boss and they were sending the contract over. I could take as much time I needed to look it over and let them know if there was anything I wasn't cool with.

*10 million for three albums*... I stared in astonishment. It was what I had always dreamed of...

A record deal, it was finally real...

I couldn't feel a thing.

I walked over to the island when I saw it... a note from Scott.

***Hey Dude... I wanted to apologize for being such a jerk in the studio a few weeks ago. I'm going to this party tonight and I think it's going to be really big... for both of us. I know we've had our ups and downs but you know I've always wanted you to succeed and have always been there for you. We're in this together brother...***

***Much Love, Much Respect***

***Scott***

I was sobbing. I killed him... Scott... my best friend. "Much love, much respect... brother"

Scott was dead and it was because of me. What had I done... what had I become?

Suddenly my phone began to vibrate violently on table.

***Mom calling. Mom calling. Mom calling.***

I wiped the tears from my eyes and tried to compose myself.

"H.. hi mom" I said voice wavering.

"Hi honey? What's wrong" she could sense it.

"No... nothing mom. It's fine. I'm fine" I said abruptly

"Okay..." she said clearly confused

"I was just calling to say hi, we haven't talked in a while and... how are you? How's Scott?"

I let out an audible sob and tried to restrain it.

"Honey?" she said concerned.

"Sc-scott... he's he's... Scott left LA mom..." I lied

"He's... he's not coming back." I couldn't control the tears now.

"Oh..." she said distantly... "I see..."

"So Scott's gone... your uncle told me they had gotten you a record deal... they were really impressed..." she said like she was talking to some kind of alien... she knew.

"Hon-..." she stopped as if correcting herself "I have to go."

"I'm glad you got what you wanted from LA... You know... I always thought you and Scott were like a team... like brothers almost... I'm surprised... I'm surprised that he '*just left*'..." I was completely silent.

She thought for a moment "I never expected you would get along that well with my family..." Somehow. Somehow she knew. I was no longer like her... I was...

***One of them.***

"Goodbye Son" she said without an ounce of warmth and hung up.

"M... m... mom? Mom!" I said into the phone, the call already ended.

I don't think It's ever going to be the same again...

I'm guilty now. Wicked. Scott's blood forever on my hands...

The phone rang... unknown number. I still don't know why I answered.

"Hi dear! It's me Susan, Scotts mom. **CON-GRATULATIONS!** Your mom told me this morning..." her voice like a droning hum, I could barely comprehend what she was saying.

"Have you heard from Scottie? There was no answer. I'm so proud of you two! You did it!"

*You did it... you did it...*

Her voice ringing in my head as the phone dropped to the ground in slow motion.

She was right...

***I did it.***
