My name is Tiffany. As of writing this, I'm 30 years old.   
  
I don't know what happened.   
  
The last thing I remember is going to bed, eager to start work the next morning. I'm a senior software engineer in Jacksonville, Florida, and I'm paid to cause problems on purpose. When I awoke, I was not in my bed. I could barely even open my eyes, for it felt like I had acid poured into them. When I came to, I was in a place which seemed vaguely familiar, but it was not my home.   
  
It was some kind of hall-like place. There was a sort of ampitheater a couple feet ahead of me, but there was nobody around. The walls and floor were a greenish color, and although there was nobody around, the place was rather brightly lit, so I knew that someone would be coming soon.   
  
It was then I noticed I couldn't move. I realized I wasn't standing up, I was sitting on some kind of chair. However, it did not feel like a normal chair. My vision was still blurry at this point, but as I looked down towards my lap, I noticed some kind of leather strap fastened around my lap - strapping me to the chair. I noticed another strap on my chest, which was pinning me to the chair. I panicked, and I tried to struggle. All this did was fill the quiet room with the sounds of crunching leather. I must've struggled for more than 15 minutes, twisting and straining as much as I could, but it was no good, as the straps simply would not budge.   
  
I quickly became exhausted. As my vision came to, I looked towards my feet, which were fastened to the leg of the chair using the same kind of leather straps which were pinning my lap and torso to the chair. I noticed something I did not before. When I saw it, I felt my stomach drop.   
  
It was a wire. A thick one, roughly as thick as a man's thumb. The wire was leading up to the chair, and that's when I realized I was strapped into an electric chair. I've always been fascinated with electric chairs, and as I scanned both the chair and my surroundings, I realized I was in Sing Sing Prison, New York, and this hall must be the infamous 'Dance Hall' that the original 'Old Sparky' chair was situated in. The 'Dance Hall' was the nickname of the execution room, though I read that Sing Sing abolished the electric chair decades ago.   
  
Suddenly, the silence in the Dance Hall was broken by a strange voice. It sounded human, and it sounded like a man's voice, but soft and somewhat high-pitched. I'd even describe it as cute-sounding. It was a lilting, almost sing-songy voice. It was peaceful, and yet, I couldn't help but notice an underlying tone of malice behind it too.   
  
The voice said: ''it's been such a long time since I've seen someone. I was so lonely!''   
  
I jerked my head around wondering where the voice was even coming from. Surely this has to be some kind of prank, I figured. But I couldn't see anyone. The voice, it sounded as if it came from the chair itself, like it was right there with me, almost as if it were touching me. I screamed out loud that if this was a joke it wasn't funny.  
  
Again, that strange voice broke the silence:  
  
''I'm here! You're sitting in my lap and I looove giving you a big huuug''  
  
Towards the end of that sentence, the tone of voice went from a sort of happy-go-lucky tone to a raspy, more malicious tone that sounded sadistic, almost mocking. It was the chair. The fucking chair spoke! I'm going mad, I tried pinching myself to see if I'm dreaming but nothing happened.   
  
I felt the hairs on my neck stand up. Here I was, alone in an execution chamber without any rational explanation, nobody around, strapped into the most infamous electric chair in history, and above all, the chair's speaking to me and refuses to let me go.  
  
After about an hour I finally get my wits about me and try and use my knowledge about the chair to talk to him. I even refer to him as 'Sparky', as 'Old Sparky' was his official name back when he was used. I asked him why he won't let me go. He told me he was feeling lonely since he was retired, and also that 'dad' would be here soon.  
  
Soon enough, a middle-aged man appeared through the door of the Dance Hall and approached me. 'I'm Warden Jones,' he said. 'I'm very sorry for the inconvinence this situation has caused you. We can't explain it either, but this chair has not been at Sing Sing Prison for decades.'   
  
'Ol' Sparky, let her go.' Warden Jones uttered, looking at the antique wooden chair with a stern expression and tone of voice.  
  
'No.' uttered the lilting voice in response.   
  
He looked at me with a strange, sad expression. He let out an exasperated sigh. I asked him to unstrap me from Sparky. He seemed reluctant for a couple of seconds, before then trying to undo the straps. My heart started to race when I realized not even the Warden could undo the straps - they just wouldn't budge, as if some kind of force was keeping them as tight as humanly possible. The Warden stood back, shaking his head. He told me the door to the electric chair's generator would not open either, and that door didn't have any locks in it.   
  
After failing to unstrap me, Jones said he could bring me food or entertainment to try and help pass the time. Because of my exhaustion of trying to free myself from the chair, I was famished. I was also bought a phone which had internet access.   
  
After eating dinner, Warden Jones told me his shift was finished and he had to go home. He kept saying he was 'so sorry' for what was happened and he seemed genuinely heartbroken, confused, and traumatized. As he left, the lights of the Dance Hall dimmed. The room was not dark, but it set a gloomy atmosphere.  
  
It must've been around 9 PM at this point. I must've cried for a few hours, feeling hopeless at this situation, even with the comfort of my phone. The chair kept speaking to me, and occasionally, I tried even making casual conversation with him as if he were a person. I tried to ask him how his day was, I even asked him how he felt about executing Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage. He said he enjoyed it, and then made a snide remark about how quickly Julius died, as if those who died quicker were somehow weak.   
  
It was nearly 12 AM it happened. The arm and shoulder straps started to move by themselves.  It happened very quickly and the straps became so tight that I could feel them bruising my skin. I yelled out to Sparky asking him what was happening. He told me:  
  
''Shh it's almost midnight. You know I'm an electric chair and not a person right? Did you really think I could resist the urge?''   
  
My heart sank and my heart raced. I felt my insides quivering uncontrollably. I screamed that I'm not a criminal and he can't kill me, not like this. I felt the chin and head strap tighten around my face and head. I began to feel sick knowing what was coming next.   
  
I suddenly heard a sound I knew all too much about - the sound of that old diesel generator whirring up. It sounded similar to an airplane engine going from taxi power to takeoff power. As the noise hit its peak, I felt an unbearable tickling sensation all over my body. I was surprised how it wasn't really painful, just immensely uncomfortable. My thoracic muscles were spasming up and down similar to how they spasm during intense laughter, except the spasms were much faster. Because of these convulsions, I actually heard myself 'laughing'. I sounded like laughter that had been sped up three times its original speed. After maybe 30 seconds, I realized that it was because of these spasms I could not breathe and I began to feel a terrible burning sensation in my chest because I was being forcibly deprived of oxygen.   
  
This continued for another 30 seconds. I began to think of my family, I wondered if I'd be reported as a missing person and they'd never know or even conceive that this is what happened to me. I thought about my boyfriend and all the experiences I'd never get to have.   
  
I don't remember anything after that. I simply remember waking up feeling very dazed. I was alive! I felt so relieved, wondering if what I experienced was just a messed up dream. Then I smelt it - the distinct smell of ozone, and I felt the ache of my thoracic muscles - the muscles which had been abused so much through electric current induced spasms. I could breathe, though it felt like it was hard to. My hands and arms were free again.

It's been days now.. I've been interviewed by more people than I can mention. Police, all kinds of prison staff, and journalists. They all are just as curious as I am about my fate. Honestly, I felt like some kind of celebrity being interviewed haha. Sparky himself enjoyed talking to the journalists... he has such a weird sense of humor sometimes.   
  
There's no getting out of the chair. Everything has been done. Police even threatened to destroy Sparky, but all that happened was Sparky threatening to electrocute me to death if they tried anything. Sparky has gave that same threat to me too.. he says if I try and harm him, he'll electrocute me until I die. He also says I'm never getting out of the chair. He says I'm going to stay strapped into him until I die of old age. Every midnight since waking up in this chair, Sparky electrocutes me until I'm on the verge of death. For some weird reason, I no longer need to go to the bathroom.

I just got news that Warden Jones resigned. Apparently due to an acute mental health crisis. Sparky doesn't seem to mind that his dad won't be here anymore.. honestly I'm starting to kind of enjoy midnights now haha. It tickles so much...when I hear that generator I kind of..happy? Like Sparky is working so hard to deliver all that current through my body, and only for me. Whenever I'm looking at stuff on my phone he likes to comment on it. He's quite the talker. He especially likes it when I look up stuff about him. He gets almost psychotically excited when I start reading about the people he electrocuted.

I think Sparky was being serious when he said I'm never getting out of this chair. It's been over a month now but hey, I got this new wooden friend to talk to, lots of internet access and food.. what more could I want? Today I realized that Sparky gets jealous of other electric chairs. I told him I do like other electric chairs too. He got quite pissed off.. he electrocuted me twice today. It's starting to feel kind of nice..

I think I'm starting to fall in love with him.. we talk all day, we watch movies together and even eat together! Honestly what a fate this is. Strapped into Old Sparky until I die of old age.. Strapped into the chair that I love the most.. it's almost midnight. Nothing I can do will get me free from him!!!

I love him so much.. all day I caress that backrest of his, and stroke his smooth wooden arms.. he told me not to caress the headpiece electrode though. I tried that this morning and he told me not to touch it.. he's so cte when he's angry. I can hear that generator starting up again hehehe..

Four Wardens have resiged from their jobs since I've been here. I asked the new Warden if he'd let me get married to Sprky. He reluctantly agreed. Sparky was so happy.
