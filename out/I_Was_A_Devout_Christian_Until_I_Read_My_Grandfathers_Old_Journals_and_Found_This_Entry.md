The angels, they have found me and they wish for nothing but to endlessly torment and violate my very soul.

My very *being*.

I hear them always. Their songs, they ring through my mind like a deafening toll of hellacious bells, beckoning me to them. Yet I refuse to heed their call, for I have seen beyond this existence, and I have looked upon their true form, and I know more than anyone alive that what lies beyond for us all is not what the preachers have promised us, nor any religious book speaks of. It is worse, more terrible and unfathomable than any human mind should even bear to understand. And yet I am burdened with this truth, with this unrelenting knowledge that beyond the veil, watching our every move, are entities that see us as a hungry pack of street dogs see’s a weak and defenceless cat.

This all began only months prior to this writing. As a preface, I should have stated first and foremost that I am an archeologist, and have been spending the past year excavating what was first believed to be a tomb of sorts found beneath an apartment complex being erected in the middle of Whitechapel. As the foundation was being formed, a few of the workers had noticed a stone that was of an unnatural shape and form protruding from the soils that they had been working on.

It didn’t take long for me to be called to the scene, as I had been in my office at the university in which I teach the exact subject of archeology, which was not so far from the dig site.

I could tell as I saw the stonework that the workers had dug up that there was certainly something of import before my eyes.

And I was correct.

Upon digging out debris and dirt and sediment and even bone, we found a man-made structure. Walls, to be precise, and even what looked to be windows, and one large opening that I presumed was once the entrance to this place. Although the belief was firstly that they had found a tomb, the men were not far from the true manner of what this place once was. Upon clearing out enough of the main room of the building, I quickly came to the conclusion that this was in fact a place of worship, not of burial. I found wooden remains of what I believed were once pews, and further in the room I found what would have been an altar.

However, it wasn’t much longer that I would find the book. The one thing within this place that should have remained buried.

After clearing my excavation team cleared out enough of the room for me to get a good understanding of what it was that I was looking at, I quickly began to journal my findings of anything that could be important, as there were no public records of a church ever being in this exact place especially one that would have been buried beneath the earth.

We found shards of glass, all of different colour and size, which I had determined was stained windows. We found bowls of wood, which was originally odd to me as I believed most churches used silver bowls to ward off demons.

And then, buried beneath one of their pews, was a book. Large, leather bound, and no discerning text on the front or back that would tell us what book this was, although again our initial belief was it was only a bible. That was until Johannes looked upon the first page, bringing to my attention that the words were in Latin, which although wasn’t very odd, the words in which were there were what changed everything.

*Septem Hymni Angeli Luciferi*

*The Seven Hymns of the Angel Lucifer*

The find was incredible. It astounded us all. We were not standing within a Catholic church lost to time as we first believed, no, we were standing in a sanctum of Wiccans. A *church of witches.* This was incredible, and the book was what I believed to be the beginning of an amazing archaeological find. 

I returned to my office with the book in hand, intending to transcribe the passages in it. A hymn book for the Devil! This was beyond my belief.

I sat at my desk, and I opened the book, its pages cracking from the release of having not been opened in an unfathomable amount of time. Each page was dry and brittle, stained from earth and age, but the writings were still precise and easy to distinguish. The first few pages were remarkable, holding prayers and rituals that each ended in *Anima mea ad te pertinet, princeps Lucifer,* which translates to “My soul belongs to you, Prince Lucifer”.

It wasn’t until the second hymn that I began to notice the changes in my surroundings.

*Vas Angelorum,* or “The Vessel of Angels”. 

The writing looked vastly different than everything I had translated prior; it looked hastily written, the letters shaky and a blotchy mess.

I remember, however, as I had written the last line of the hymn, it began immediately. I fear I will remember that moment forever, in truth.

The candle at my desk blew out, although there was not a breeze or even a breath near the flame to extinguish it. I *swore* I heard a child's laughter as it had gone out. I stood immediately, calling out into the black of night for whoever was in the room with me to show themselves but all I had received for an answer was the sensation that somewhere in this room, someone was observing me.

Studying me. 

In the black emptiness before me was an entity, of this I was sure, that was preying on the very fear that was emanating from my core.

Some part of my sanity tried to believe that this fearful response was irrational, and only caused by the long hours of being in the witches church, and reading from this book; yet that belief diminished as I heard it for the first time.

It was a low hum, and yet somehow it had sounded powerful, as if it were beside me. Inside of me. As if the very vibration could shake my soul from my body. And it rose in power and volume and mass, as what sounded like more sources joined the chorus until the singular hum became a collective call, a cry of anger and euphoric pleasure and agonising, unending pain all mixed into one harmonious call. It was so beautiful, so addictive and drug-like. I was drawn to the sound in a hypnotic fashion, completely unable to initially feel the burning pain that had begun to ripple through me.

I was frozen solid as the sound tore through me, tearing through every bone in my body and rendering my skin from my flesh. I tried to cry out, to beg for the sounds to stop, but I choked on my very breath, I tried to fight for air but it felt as though it were full of burning hot coals. I fell to my knees as the pain took over, and I felt near unconscious as one of *them* showed themselves to me.

My candle lit itself, and standing before me was, and I still don’t quite understand how I know this, an angel.

It was skeletal, its skin coarse and scarred and burned and leathery. It had no mouth, but two white eyes that were crying a stream of viscous black liquid. Its wings were broken and bone. It was completely naked, yet devoid of any significance of gender or form. Its very presence had caused my heart to cease for a moment.

And I sensed through its blind appearance that it stared directly at me. 

*Into* me. 

The chorus grew louder as it kneels before me, laying its hand against my cheek. The very touch of the creature sent aeons of knowledge and pain and truth and obliteration through me. It told me the truth. That we are wrong when we speak of heaven and hell, that there are no divided armies above and below. There is only *Them,* the ones who created us, created the entire universe and even the first molecule, as a sick and twisted form of fun. They gave us life to watch something die. They made us happy so we could feel pain. They let us begin, only to witness our end. 

I saw what happens after life. My soul explored the melting pot of the endless lives that have perished, all burning and being devoured by these creatures. I saw the sands of time dwindle to nothing as the final breath of the universe ended. 

The creature told me that they were getting bored, and they wanted to begin experimenting on us, and I was one of the first.

For weeks now, I can hear them all talk all at once inside of me, I feel their hatred and their rage and their undying desire to tear us apart every waking moment. And when I sleep, I see their faces, their songs grow louder. 

In truth, I have tried to end it all. I’ve placed a gun in my mouth and I’ve pulled the trigger only for the song to grow louder and to be unharmed, yet still being granted the pain of the action. I tried hanging, and they took the breath from my lungs for hours, yet not allowing me to die so they could watch me wither and writhe in pain and agony. 

I know not what to do to save myself from this eternal torment. I only wish for this to end.
