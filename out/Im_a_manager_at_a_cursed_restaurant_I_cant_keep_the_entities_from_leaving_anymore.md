My name is Liam, and I am a manager at a fast food restaurant. But this restaurant is… not like any other one. Its frequently visited by… entities. I recently took a promotion as nighttime manager, and tonight, my staff and I nearly died. 

I was promoted to manager almost last month, and the promotion came with its own special set of rules. Being an employee also came with a set of rules, but these manager ones… were stranger. And yes, before you point out the obvious, I work a Rules job. The pay is just too good for me to give up. The rules are as follows:

1: If someone does not show up, you will have to take their place in the kitchen. However, if they are late and are standing by the door not coming in, DO NOT INVITE THEM IN. Instead, make them follow you to the back of the restaurant and shoot them.

2: There are specific codes for anything situation related. Here are the codes:


Code Yellow: The strange man is here (Reference Rule 4)

Code Blue: Harry has entered the freezer
(Reference Rule 3) 

Code Green: The Vent Creature has returned 
(Reference Rules 6)

Code Orange: Madam Citrus wants a chat
(Reference Rule 8)

Code Red: Mr Morbid
(Reference Rule 9)

Code White: Play Man
(Reference Rule 7)


Rule 3: Code Blue. Head into the freezer with your provided gun and shoot whatever is eating the meat in there. If there’s nothing there, shoot the employee who called the Code Blue. It’s not them.

Rule 4: Code Yellow: Press the button on your desk. The metal shutters will automatically come down as the button is pressed. Pull the door shutters over them and lock the door. Close the drive thru window with the shutters and barricade the back door. Hide in the freezer. Make no noise

Rule 5: If you hear whispering behind you, pay no attention to it. If you hear screaming, turn around and choke whatever it is. If you feel fingers in your neck, RUN OFF THE PROPERTY 

Rule 6: Code Green: Tell everyone to evacuate and lock all possible entry ways as soon as possible. Call the owner. Only he can get that thing out of there. 

Rule 7: Code White: Head into the Children’s Playplace and kill the creature residing in the ball pit.

Rule 8: Code Orange: Head to the parking lot and speak with the tall woman. Comply with what she asks and offer her a drink. If she accepts, then shoot her. That’s not Madam Citrus.

Rule 9: Code Red: Get all the employees into the strange van that’s always at the front of the lot. Load everyone up, lock the building up, and drive away. Him showing up means he has figure out how to free the entities. There is a separate rule sheet in the glove box for the van that you MUST follow while driving it. You won’t be driving in the same universe afterwards.

I always dismissed the last rule due to its outlandish mess, and never expected for it to come true. But today, at around Noon, it happened. I was walking outside to throw away trash, when I saw him. He was sitting behind a tree, smiling an inhumane, ungodly smile that stretched from cheek to cheek.

I rushed into the building and yelled “CODE RED!” as loud as I physically could. The employees scrambled to get everyone out and get me the keys to the Grey van. I closed up shop, and I glanced towards the tree. He wasn’t there

“SHIT!” I yelled out loud. I zoomed to the van and started it up. I drove as fast as I could out of the parking lot with my everyone else in the back. 

“Alright, guys, is everyone good back there?” I said.

“Yeah, we’re all good here.” Said Tyler.

“Everyone accounted for, Emma?”

“Yes, Liam.” Everyone’s here.”

“Good. I need everyone to understand that it’s gonna take a while to come back home after this.”

“Yeah, we know.” Said Michael, in a sort of depressed tone.

“And you took my phone and contacted the owner?”

“Yeah, we did that.” Said Skylar. 

Before I could ask my next question, Mr. Morbid appeared besides us, running at inhuman speeds. 

“SHIT! HOLD ON!” I yelled.

He slammed into us, causing the van to sway and shake. But I slammed right back and he went flying. But I noticed that now, there were no buildings and streets. Just a bunch of starry black. 

I handed this to the person next to me, and he is finishing writing this while I am actually escaping Mr. Morbid. This will be a log of our experiences. If we do not make another part, assume we didn’t make it out alive. Hope to write you all soon.
