It started about two months ago, when I was walking my dog and I happened to see a garage sale, it was one of my elderly neighbours who lived a few streets over from me. She was super friendly and had this gorgeous antique mirror. Me and my wife (Lily) had been looking for somthing just like it, it was in pretty good condition and she was selling it for only 10 bucks. Now I know why she was so keen to get rid of it. 

Well anyway, I put up the mirror and it did look amazing in our dining room. It stood grandly above the table, and really opened up the room. Lily and I where very pleased with it, but then everything turned south.

I very first noticed her after roughly a week? Maybe 10 days I'm not sure. But I was setting the table, ready for dinner, when behind me on my left side, I saw a small brown/black haired head pop up and scurry past and shoot into the curtains, I felt her brush past me too. I smiled, thinking it was my youngest daughter, Molly, and said, "Hmm I wonder who that could be.." and sorta jumped and turned pulling back the curtain. No sweet giggle, or a gap - toothed grin met me. No one was there. Lily came in, and I asked her where molly was. She was in the front room watching bluey, ( her favourite show about these Australian dogs ) and hadn't moved. When I told her about what I saw, she laughed, and  playfully saying I was going mad. I brushed it off, I was just tired. 

However, I saw this girl again, ive observed her to have waist length dark hair, and a blue dress on, she has no shoes though.

This time, she was peeping from behind the curtains, I caught her out the corner of my eye. When I turned around she was gone, but the mirror told a different story. The moment I saw her, my blood ran cold. My eldest children, my son and daughter, Eric and Madison were in the room this time with me, but hadn't spotted her. I hurried them out, saying I was bored of homework- and we should watch a film. So I sent them to make some popcorn and pick a film while I cleaned up. But really, I just wanted them out of the room. The girl was looking right at them grinning, in a weird way I really didn't like. I locked the dining room door and didn't go near it until Lily returned with molly. During this time I swear to god I heard banging and knocking from inside the dining room, but I just turned up the TV and prayed my kids didn't hear it. When Lily and molly returned from a birthday party, they were both were tired out. I didn't mention the little girl to Lily,  I didn't want to seem crazy, and she wasn't really dangerous?

This went on for about a month. I kept catching glimpses, of her hiding under the table, behind a chair, but her favourite spot was the curtain. I never saw more of her face than her eyes though. The spookiest one was when I was eating dinner, and I could feel her stood behind me, breathing down my neck. I lost my appetite very quickly as you can imagine and ushered everyone out to eat infront of the tv. I get very uneasy when thinking about her. I mentioned her twice again to Lily, but she took it as a lame attempt to scare her. Until one day I received a call whilst I was at work. 

"Okay mr smart ass, how the hell did you pull it off?"

"Honey, what do you mean?" I inquired

"I mean the little girl in the mirror, it gave me quite a fright, but yes yes very clever. What is it? A screen? Or an overlay or somthing?" 
I remember my heart skipping a beat, and suddenly feeling light headed. I said in a dark, serious tone:

"Lily, I'm being serious you get out of that room, and lock the door. Now. I'm coming home" 
She was quiet for a moment and then replied,

"Nick, this isn't funny anymore"

"Lily I'm not joking get out of that room" 

"Look, I get that you might think this is fu- Nick, nick its moved. Why the hell has it moved?" I could hear the panic rising in her voice. I stood up, closed my laptop and ran. 

"Lock the door, just get out and lock it Lils" 

"Okay okay... OH! Oh my god somthing just touched me- what the fu-" I could hear her moving about and then a scream. I called her name, I was in the car by now furiously driving back. All could hear was scrambling. 
"Hurry back please, i dont know what to do" she was on the verge of tears, I could hear it in her voice. She was out the room, and sat on the stairs, the dining room door to the right of them. It was quiet for a moment then. 
Tap... tap... tap..
tap tap tap tap tap 

"Nick, nick hurry somthing's knocking on the door. Nick omg nick!" I could hear an angry banging by now. I stepped on the gas, and was home minutes later. Lily was outside already, I ran to her and hugged her close whilst she sobbed on my shoulder. I comforted her, and took her slowly back to the house. But as soon as we stepped into the house 

BANG BANG BANG 
 The door was shaking, the door knob rattling. I thought it was going to come off its hinges. Lily screamed, jumping back, covering her eyes. I banged back on the door  "SHUT UP!" I yelled from the other side. "LEAVE US ALONE". And all fell quiet. 

We didn't go in there for a week. 

Anytime we did, somthing bad happened. I went in to get my laptop, somthing ripped it out my hands, sending it flying into the wall, smashing to bits. She was laughing at me in the mirror. Lily was vacuuming in there and a vase fell off, smashing on her foot and cutting it pretty bad. We didn't let the kids in there, but Eric came out one day, after sneaking in, with three huge scratches down his back and crying his eyes out. This was the final straw, nothing hurts my kids. 

We figured it was the mirror, seemingly as it was only in that room and in that mirror we saw her, and it started when we got it. So I grabbed my bat, and shouted at her trying to scare her off. She was laughing behind the curtain. She seemed a lot happier recently. 
"You can stay and laugh, and even break my shit but don't you dare hurt my kids. You leave us alone. Now." her face twisted in ways a child's shouldn't. She was angry, her brow was furrowed, and ro be honest, I'm glad i couldn't see the rest of her face. She shrunk back behind the curtain. I turned to look at the curtain, to see if she was really gone, but a wave of fear washed over me as I did so.

Then my head split in an excruciating agony and i yelled out. Warm blood trickled down my face. In a panic I looked in the mirror, she was there, stood on the table, clawing at me. The lights were going nuts, and everything was ice cold. I swung my bat, making contact with the mirror and it shattered into pieces. I kept swinging, over and over until I calmed down a bit. I couldn't feel her anymore. But one thing that worried me was in the back of the frame, it says "thank you :)" in a dried brown substance I'm really hoping is paint. 
This happened about an hour ago, she's really messed up my face and chest, I'm covered in cuts but it's been quiet so far. I'm going to try and talk to the old woman I bought this off, but I just can't shake the feeling she's not really gone. 

I'll update when I see the old woman, and if anything else happens but could anyone give me any advice if she comes back, or any pointers on what she might be?

 Thanks, Nick.
