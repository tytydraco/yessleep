I have always been fascinated when it comes to the supernatural. Paranormal. And just unexplained things in general. But aliens. Extraterrestrials have always been my favorite because I've always believed in those the most. 


To me the idea that there's life in the universe other than ourselves. And that this life had found its way to us and has been watching us had always seemed far more possible than the idea that there's a giant 9 foot tall ape man wandering around the United states. At least in my opinion.


I'd always loved watching cheesy "Real" Ufo videos on YouTube. Along with conspiracy theories and stories from alien abduction victims. I've never really believed those videos were real because it's very easy to lie and make stuff up and barely any of them had evidence to support them. But I was still intrigued by them simply because of my love for the idea of extraterrestrials. But I'd never experienced anything myself... 


until a couple months ago.


I live out in the middle of the country. There's nobody around me, the nearest house is at least a mile away. My house is in the middle of multiple fields. Surrounding the fields almost completely are trees. There's a couple ponds at the edge of the trees where me and my dad used to go fishing when i was a kid. It's a beautiful place to say the least


I have a German shepherd and a bulldog. I usually walk them both a mile each in the evening before the sun goes down. It's nice and cool in the evening and I have a perfect view of the sunset when I go out walking. I usually walk to the pond which is about half a mile away. So it's a mile to walk there and back. One night I was walking my female bulldog back home from her walk and I noticed this light above the trees North from my house. I assumed like most people would that it was a star. Because the sun was about to go fully down and they would start coming out. But I had never seen it before and it seemed brighter than the others that had started to show. But I dismissed the idea that it was abnormal and finished walking my pup. 


That night was the start of the dreams.

I'm not a big Dreamer anymore. If I do dream i almost always forget them by morning. As far as I know it was nothing but darkness until I wake up. And if I do remember something it's usually very blurry. But not this time. 

It was a very short dream. But it was extremely vivid. In the dream I was laying in my bed. I'm not sure if I was asleep in the dream or just laying with my eyes closed. But I remember hearing this loud Humming sort of noise. The only thing I can compare it with is if you hear a semi truck driving by alone on the road and you hear it slowly getting closer and closer and the tires on the road mixed with the engine and the wind rushing past it make a very specific loud hum... anyway I open my eyes in the dream and I listen and the noise gets louder and louder and things in my room start vibrating. And it just stops suddenly like you flipped an off switch. That's when my whole room lit up from a bright light coming from my window.

I jerked awake and sat up. I checked my phone and it was 6:52 AM. The sun was just rising and the birds were chirping like nothing happened. I looked around for a few seconds still a little groggy and weirded out. But I shrug it off as just a weird dream and nothing more. I continued walking my dogs in the evening like I always have and I didn't see the light above the trees again Until about two weeks later.


I finish up my walk again and that's when I saw it over the trees in the same place. But I noticed something different about it this time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what it was but when I realized what it was it sent shivers down my spine.

It was bigger. Or maybe it was closer. It hadn't doubled in size or anything but it was noticeably different at least. I decided to take out my phone and take a picture of it to compare it if I saw it again. I quickly snap three or four pictures before finishing walking to the house. I give the dogs some water and quickly open my phone to take a look and my heart drops. It wasn't there. I scroll through them muttering to myself as I do so. I walk back outside to look and it was gone.


That night was when the second dream happened.

The dream started very similar to the first. I'm laying on my bed. But I'm not awoken by a loud hum or by some lights outside my window. I'm simply thirsty. I check the time. "1:43 am" I groan to myself. I Get up and walk through the house. There's something strange about the house but I'll get to that later. I walk into the kitchen and go To the refrigerator and grab a bottle of water. That's when I do something strange. I decide to go to the window and look outside while I take a drink of my water. And there it is. The light above the trees. I lower the bottle and just stare at it for a few seconds until my blood feels like it turns to ice. I hear this voice. This deep morphed voice in the back of my skull. "You can't run from the lights". It echoed through my brain for a few seconds.


That's when I jerk awake. I sit up in my bed sweaty and my hair is a bigger miss than usual. I check the time and it's 3:13 AM. Still pitch black outside. I didn't even try to go back to sleep after that. How could i? I said earlier that there was something off about my house in the dream. And it took my awhile to realize what it was.


But The house was the exact same as it was the day before. For a lot of people that probably doesn't seem like a big deal. But to me it is. Whenever I have a dream I actually remember about the house. It had always been an older version of the house. Like how it looked when I was a kid. I guess because that's how I remembered it most fondly. Even then it was never exactly how it was in real life. There would always be something out of place. If you have dreams about locations you've been I'm sure you know what I mean. Your brain can't picture it perfectly or something I guess so it fills in the blanks. But not this time. It was how my house currently looked and it was perfect.


It didn't take two weeks for me to see the light again. Only one. I had worked overtime at work that day so I was extra exhausted and hadn't taken the dogs for their evening walks. But I put my female bulldog outside in her pen because she had gone into heat and I didn't want her around my male german shepherd while i wasn't supervising. After that i saw it when I was taking the trash to the road for the garbage truck to pick up in the morning. I always try to take it the evening before trash day because sometimes I forget otherwise. I put the bag in the garbage can and I look up and sure enough. It was there. And it was bigger than before. Like it was taunting me. I didn't wanna go to sleep that night but the exhaustion was overwhelming and I had to be at work again tomorrow.


That night was when the third dream occurred. I'm not sure when I fell asleep that night. I layed there for what felt like hours until I finally dozed off. I guess it was around  maybe 11:30 PM give or take. The third dream starts off the same as the other two. I wake up in my bed. My German shepherd is scratching at the door and wining telling me he needs to go outside to use the bathroom. I check my phone and it says 2:21 AM. I walk my dog through the house (which is exactly the same as the last dream) to the backdoor. I put his harness and leash on and we walk outside. I walk him around for about 2 or 3 minutes. He finally finds a spot he deems worthy to do his business. He finishes and we're walking back to the backdoor and that's when my German shepherd just stops and his ears perk up and he looks towards the side of the house. My female bulldog starts barking and growling from her pen and my German shepherd starts barking as they both look around the side of the house. A few seconds go by and this thing. This creature just runs around the side of the house towards me. It crosses 20 feet in just a couple strides. 


And that's when I wake up. But I don't jerk awake like I do the last two times. I just wake up and open my eyes. My feet are tingling and I have goosebumps all over my body. I don't move because I just feel like I'm being watched. I lay there for what feels like an eternity until I finally get up the courage to move. I slowly sit up and look around. Everything seems fine. I check my phone and it says 6:03 AM. I get up turn the light on. I get chills as I look on my arm. Bruises. Bruises On both my arms. Nothing huge. But they were there.


I don't know if its aliens. Or if I'm going insane. Maybe its both. But something is happening to me. I've woken up with more bruises and marks on my arms and back. I've tried to tell my friends and they all tell me I need therapy. Maybe I do. I don't know what's happening. I try to sleep as little as possible now. Once every couple days. And I try to sneak it in during the day when I do. I feel bad for taking my dogs for less walks now. But when I do I can't help but feel like I'm being watched.
