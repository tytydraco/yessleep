*“You sure this is the right place, Hank?”* I shouted from outside the limousine.

The husky chauffeur didn’t respond, attention transfixed on his handheld television, fiddling with the antennae to minimize static. A cold October wind howled through the valley, causing the slit of my black dress to flutter against my thigh. Frustration mounted behind my eyes as I waited for an answer, glaring through the passenger’s side window while shivering from the violent squall.

Getting the sense that he was intentionally ignoring me, I pulled trembling fists from the pockets of my wool coat and improvised a drum solo against the thick glass. My knuckles were so cold that I barely felt them make contact.

The amateur rendition of Van Halen’s *“Hot For Teacher”* was enough to get his attention. A scowl curled up the side of his face. Without moving his eyes away from the blinking screen, Hank leaned over to roll down the window, his beer gut flopping awkwardly over the central console like a pillowcase half filled with maple syrup. He gave the crank two lazy twists, and the window creaked down a few inches.

*“Robin - what the fuck is the matter? It’s the goddamned World Series,”* he said, pointing at the small TV and acting like I was unaware of that fact. Hank had nearly careened off the road multiple times on the thirty-minute drive over here, seemingly unable to drag his eyes away from the game for more than a handful of seconds at a time.

I felt a myriad of insults thump against the back of my teeth, begging to be unleashed, but I swallowed my annoyance.

*“Can you please just look at the sign?”* I pleaded, gesturing to the name listed above a picture of the deceased.

*“…’85 wasn’t our year, but ‘87…’87 is for The Cardinals…”* he muttered, still glued to the feed.

*“Hank, for the love of God, confirm that I’m walking into the right funeral or I’m getting back into the car. I was told the guy’s name was "‘John’, not ‘Jom’. The damn sign says ‘Jom’.”* I snapped.

Hank slumped his shoulders with childlike exaggeration and sighed. Reluctantly, he shoved a meaty claw into the breast pocket of his blazer, digging around for the instructions given to him by our escort agency. With a crumpled slip of paper in hand, his pupils finally detached from the game. Hastily, he scanned the name and date.

*“Looks right to me,”* he remarked. Before I could ask to see it too, he spat chewing tobacco that had been resting along his gumline into the slip. My eyes widened in disbelief as I watched Hank wrap the paper around the brown-black ichor, only to then toss the malformed lump into his coffee cup.

*“Christ, Hank. You couldn’t have just handed it to me, like a human being? Or are you not a human being? Maybe you're actually some human-shaped donkey? Does that sound right?”*

The insult finally brought his eyes to meet mine. Instead of anger, he shot me a threatening grin. A wolf’s smile, bearing hungry canines in my direction.

*“Look, doll - how about you tiptoe those fragile, porcelain feet up to the home’s concierge and ask about the service? I’ll wait here. If it ain’t right, we’ll go back to the office.”*

He expected a sheepish reply, but I sure as shit didn’t give him one, instead providing a thumbs up with my right hand and a middle finger with my left. I didn’t scare easy. Not only that, but I’ve been in the escort business long enough to know the difference between an actual predator and a small man making empty threats.

When I turned to walk up the cobblestone path that led to the funeral home, my ears became filled with the sound of Hank slamming his foot down on the accelerator, tires screeching against asphalt. Didn’t even bother to turn back around, honestly. No point.

*“Asshole.”* I murmured, securing my purse under my arm to prevent it from blowing away as I approached the opulent, repurposed plantation house.

The mansion’s white pillars loomed over me as I carefully climbed the porch steps, stilettos clacking against the refurbished wood. As I stepped toward the front door, a surge of anxiety unexpectedly sprinted up the length of my spine and planted itself at the top of my neck, crackling around the base of my skull like electricity from an exposed wire. With my heartbeat galloping in my chest, I took a deep breath and twisted the knob, not willing to let nervous energy prevent me from earning my keep.

A lot of what happened to me was out of my control, but I did one thing wrong that day. My gut was screaming for me to turn around. It implored me to sprint back down those stairs and into the street like the devil themself was close behind me, nipping at my heels.

But I ignored the feeling, contorted my face into an expression of grief, and pushed on, unknowingly putting myself into the Cult of the Scarab's crosshairs, intruding on their rite of sacred renewal.

\----------

*“Right this way, ma’am,”* said the funeral director, leading me into a familiar narrow hallway behind the lobby. Only a week earlier I’d been at this funeral home, pretending to grieve over someone else. As we walked, I reviewed the details I’d received concerning the deceased, provided to my agency by his company’s board of investors.

*Pharmaceutical CFO. Passed in his late sixties. Very private. Had two previous marriages. Right hand was mangled during his tenure in Vietnam, doesn’t bother with a prosthetic. Months before his death, rumors of him being gay cropped up in the tabloids.*

*I’m playing his secret lover. An unknown buxom paramour, weeping over the loss of their sugar daddy, dispelling the whispers of his potential homosexuality.*

People purchased my time for an assortment of different reasons. Sometimes, I was hired by the soon-to-be deceased, arriving at their memorial service just to boost the overall number of attendees visibly present and grieving. Other times, the request was more specific and it wasn’t the deceased who was hiring me.

This was one of those *other times.*

It wasn’t glamorous work, lying at some poor sap’s funeral on the behalf of someone else and their interests, but it was much preferable to the labor I performed when I was first hired. Think fishnet stockings and disagreements over the virtues of condom use.

All that said, it'd be disingenuous to say I wasn't proud of myself.

This was my niche, and despite the seediness, it was mine, and I was good at it. Considered an expert, actually. Anyone can show up and be a pretty face in the crowd; a twenty-something with running mascara and a nice ass cartoonishly *boo-hooing* into an open casket. But me? I played the assigned role with tact and nuance. I sold a narrative, and nine times out of ten, my marks bought it.

The key was you needed to be a proficient improviser.

Discretion was the name of the game in my line of work; I rarely got a lot of background information about the deceased to work with. Meant I had to be capable of thinking on my toes - bobbing and weaving through conversations like my life depended on it.

Ironically, though, if I wasn’t so damn convincing, I might not have ended up almost suffocating to death less than an hour after the funeral concluded.

\----------

I expected all the usual sounds of organized memorial would become audible as we approached the reception hall; sobbing, a pipe organ singing its quiet lamentations, hushed arguments over the division of an inheritance. Sounds most people associated with deep sorrow. To me, however, mourning sounded like work. It was ambient noise I had become so accustomed to that I barely even noticed it.

But that’s not what I heard as we drew closer to the service. Quite the opposite, actually. Joyful sounds reverberated down the hallway. As the funeral director opened the door to the reception hall, I heard laughing and the clinking of glasses. The sparkling timbre of a wedding filled my ears, not the joyless dirge of a wake.

I stepped in, and for a moment, I truly believed I was walking in on some kind of themed birthday party. Every attendee sported a pure white outfit, head to toe. The previously jubilant noise fizzled out into dead silence when they saw me enter, adorned in funerary black. I was nearly about to excuse myself back through the door when I spied a young man at the opposite end of the vast room, dressed in a black three-piece suit, leaning wearily against an enormous marble coffin.

*“Is…is this Jom’s funeral?”* I managed to sputter out into the motionless crowd.

The fifty or so funeral goers remained silent. I could tell that something about my arrival was intensely befuddling, with looks of confusion painted over the attendee’s faces. Eventually, the shrill squeaking of poorly lubricated metal wheels broke the silence. The crowd parted to reveal an elderly woman in a wheelchair pushing herself towards me. She peered from side-to-side as she approached, observing the still petrified mourners staring at me with a look of disapproval.

*“Oh, would you relax? Go back to what you were doing. I’ll figure it out. Khepri save us, y’all would be startled shitless by a ladybug if it flew at you too fast,”* she croaked. Slowly, the figures in white pulled their attention away from me, and the lively chatter resumed, albeit at a much lower volume.

With the funeral reanimated, the elderly woman brought her eyes to mine, converting her scowl into a toothy grin. A wispy white dress hung loosely from her skeletal frame, giving her the appearance of a mobility-challenged banshee. The weight of a golden broach pulled the front of her dress forward at the collarbone, revealing the outlines of her upper ribs through thin, liver spotted skin. The accessory was about the size of a golf ball, and it depicted a beetle with what looked like a lotus flower etched onto its wings.

*“And you are, dear?”* she asked, settling in front of me by using a levered brake to halt the wheelchair’s momentum.

Based on the woman’s command of the other mourners and her wizened appearance, I made an educated guess as to her identity.

*“Hi…you must be Jom’s mother?”*

She nodded, her brow furrowing and her grin melting away as her head tilted up and down. The matriarch studied me intensely, her expression now twisted into one of confusion, like those of the mourners when they first saw me.

Relief fluttered through my chest. I briefly savored the pleasurable rush that came after the anxiety of a calculated risk. Then I smiled, took a generous inhale, and continued, launching into an ad libbed speech I had given countless times before.

*"It is nice finally to meet you. I…I wish it wasn’t under these circumstances, and I wish I knew your first name, but you know how private Jom can be-”*

I paused and forced a chuckle, letting tears well up as I broke eye contact - body language that screamed “*I’m struggling to use past tense now that he's dead, oh the sweet misery”*. A sigh fell from my lips, and then I picked up where I left off.

*“…you know how private Jom* ***could*** *be. I’m Tara. Your son and I were together for the last year or so. What’s your first name, ma’am?”*

Unexpectedly, I watched her eyes widen with some mix of alarm and disbelief.

*“It’s…it’s Akila”*

Without saying anything more, she abruptly pivoted her head and torso around, scanning the room for someone. Akila seemingly couldn’t locate them in the crowd, so she just started shouting a name.

*“Horus! Hoooorus! Could someone bring my grandson over?”*

The figures closest to us leaped into action, clearly fighting to be the person that fulfilled Akila’s request. Within seconds, one of the attendees, a hulking middle-aged man with biceps like tree trunks, returned with the kid in the black suit that had been previously leaning against the coffin, practically dragging the miserable looking young man by the wrist to his grandmother.

*“Ah! There you are, Horus.”* Akila cooed.

The boy barely responded, giving his elder an affirmative grunt. Before he was pulled from the crowd, I was laser focused on selling my story, constructing answers to questions that hadn’t even been asked yet. Seeing the anguish dripping off his features broke my concentration.

He looked to be in his early twenties, about six-feet tall, with a shaved head and a half crescent nose ring connecting his nostrils. His eyes were saturated with a deep, reflective sadness, his gaze empty and distant, like he was watching a memory rather than actually seeing anything physically in front of him. The corners of his mouth were collapsed into a rigid, immovable frown, the type of vacant expression that’s left over only after you’ve already completely exhausted every other painful emotion.

My heart broke for him. Whatever familial weirdness was currently on display, with the perfect white dress code and the inappropriately cheery atmosphere, the kid seemed like he was the only one experiencing genuine grief. His dad was dead, and he looked hurt and alone.

That empathy would last about another ten minutes.

*“Horus…this woman, Tara, is claiming to have been with your father, and she’s showing up here dressed like…dressed like that. Did you know anything about this?”*

*This might be game over,* I thought to myself. *Need to come up with a way to recover.*

He pointed his empty gaze at me. For a second, his eyes remained cold. But then, like the flash of blinding white light before the explosion of an atomic bomb, his expression instantly brightened and became animated. It wasn’t recognition that had reignited Horus; it was something else.

It was an idea. I didn’t know it at the time, but Horus was a pretty damn good improvisor as well.

*“Yeah, I know her. Dad mentioned her a few times in passing. Told me that she may or may not show up today. He wasn’t sure whether she really loved him or not, but I think he told her to show up if she did really love him.”*

He paused, calculating what to say next.

*“Tara’s an outsider. Dad wasn’t sure that we’d accept her, especially after what happened with Diane.”*

Akila turned back to me, now stone-faced and deathly serious.

*“Well, Tara, is all that true? You’re here because you loved my son?”*

I didn’t have long to contemplate the strangeness that was unfolding in front me, so I acted on instinct.

Terrible call.

*“…yes! Yes, I loved Jom. That’s why I’m here.”*

Horus nearly crumbled to the ground, his immovable frown dissipating into a grin swollen with ecstasy.

*“Well…well alright then. That’s very noble of you, to come here of your own volition, espousing your love from my son. Bassel, could you escort Tara to the front? Show her where family sits? The eulogy will be starting in a few minutes.”* Akila replied.

The brawny gentleman with the tree-trunk biceps walked over, placing one massive arm forward to guide me and the other massive arm on my shoulder, as if to make sure I wasn’t going anywhere.

Behind me, I heard Horus cackling, doubling over and practically wheezing from whatever he found to be so goddamned funny.

\----------

There was a certain comedy to the way Akila had been positioned to deliver the eulogy. I couldn’t appreciate the humor of it at the time, with Bassel following me like a shadow, his looming presence causing a veritable chorus of alarm bells to ring loudly in my skull. But, in retrospect, I remember the juxtaposition of her in front of the casket being genuinely funny.

She was just so absurdly small, and the coffin was just so absurdly big. A marble torpedo behind a human earthworm, wrinkled skin flapping up and down as she spewed her ritualistic bullshit into the microphone.

*“Jom was a wonderful son, a loving father, and a devoted vicar of Khepri.”* Akila boomed, voice tinged with bursts of static from cheap speaker systems.

*“When Jom was on death’s door, we all felt his pain. In terms of renewal, he was without an ideal conduit. We all still grieve the loss of Diane, consumed by heresy, leaving him without love and Horus without a mother.”*

I turned to Bassel, pointing to my bladder and then pointing to the door. It was a lie; nature wasn’t calling. Not in that sense, at least. My subconscious was screaming, begging me to get the fuck out of that room through whatever means possible.

*Something is so fucking wrong,* I thought, waiting for Bassel to respond to my pantomiming.

He smiled, but it wasn’t reassuring. The grin was patronizing, revealing his own bitter amusement rather than his willingness to help, like he was watching his cat trying and failing to jump onto a forbidden table.

The man shook his head *no* a few times, and then placed a hand over my scalp, manually twisting my head back in the direction of Akila.

*“Little did we know, however, that in the nick of time, Jom found love. He was scared to divulge his love to us, because she is an outsider, just as Diane was. But, by being here, she has proven herself worthy of Khepri’s embrace, unlike the heretic.”* she said, gesturing a bony hand in my direction, long acrylic nails taking the shape of hawk talons.

*“Tara - we’re very grateful for your love, and your commitment to Jom. As you well know, passionate love is the best conduit. It's easier for Khepri to mold. But, of course, the love of youngest son will do if passionate love isn’t available. All that is to say, I’m sure Horus is very grateful, as well.”*

At that point, my heart was crashing against my rib cage like jackhammer, percussive and relentless. Bassel’s sturdy hand remained on my head, fixing my gaze on Akila.

Because of that, I couldn’t look away when the matriarch turned to face me, detailing what was to be my fate.

*“Your black night, desolate and bare, will draw the death from Jom, granting him renewal.”*

Sweat poured over my body, drenching me with sticky fear.

*“Are you ready, Tara?”*

Another white-clad figure appeared behind Akila, wrenching the heavy lid of the casket open.

Inside, Jom’s desiccated corpse laid flat, arms crossed over his shoulders, naked as the day he was born. But his body only covered half of the available space.

You see, the reason the coffin was so damn large is because it was built to house two separate people. The other half *had* been for Jom’s son, but now it was designated for me.

They were going to bury me alive in that marble tomb. 

As if I even needed it confirmed at that point, I noted that the body had both of their hands. My actual assignment had lost one of his during their tour of Vietnam.

Hank had dropped me off on the wrong day.

When I didn’t move towards the casket, paralyzed by fear, Akila spoke into the microphone one more time, sharp static crackling through the speakers again like an electric tongue whipping invisibly through the air.

*“Bassel, it seems like Tara is having a bit of cold feet. Bring her over here, show our conduit how spacious it is inside, next to her beloved.”*

The man’s muscular paw pulled my head up, forcing me to my feet.

I tried to brainstorm even a fragment of an exit strategy, but for the second time that day, Horus broke my concentration.

Somewhere in the back of the room, I heard him snickering under his breath, downright elated with his unbelievably good fortune.

I wouldn’t let him distract me again after that.
