It started as a simple visit to the doctor. I had been struggling with insomnia for the better part of six months, and it was wearing me down. Late nights turned into groggy mornings, and I was walking around in a fog for most of the day. My performance at work had dipped, and I found myself making simple mistakes that I normally wouldn’t. Something had to give.

My doctor, Dr. Patel, was patient with me as I described the symptoms. We had tried some basic over-the-counter options, and I’d even tried adjusting my routine—cutting back on caffeine, dimming the lights, turning off electronics—but nothing seemed to stick. He listened as I explained how, when I finally did manage to sleep, it was fitful and broken, like my brain couldn’t quite let go of the day.

“I think it’s time we tried something a little stronger,” he said, typing something into his computer. “I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help regulate your sleep cycle.”

It sounded like a reasonable next step. I was hesitant about taking prescription meds for sleep, but Dr. Patel assured me that it was a low-dose and designed to help without any significant side effects.

“This should help reset things for you,” he explained as he handed me the prescription. “Take it about an hour before you plan on going to bed, and make sure you give yourself a full eight hours of sleep. If it’s not working, or if you feel off in any way, let me know.”

I left his office feeling hopeful for the first time in a while. That night, I followed his instructions to the letter. I took the pill, brushed my teeth, and climbed into bed with my usual doubts that it would work.

To my surprise, the first few nights went smoothly. The medication helped me fall asleep quickly, and though I would wake up once or twice during the night, I fell back asleep almost instantly. It was the kind of restful sleep I hadn’t had in months.

But after about a week, things started to change.

It began with small, almost unnoticeable things—at least, things I tried to ignore. I’d wake up feeling a bit disoriented, not entirely sure how long I’d been asleep. Sometimes, I’d have vague, unsettling dreams I couldn’t quite remember. Dreams where I wasn’t sure if I was awake or still dreaming. In these dreams, I’d find myself doing normal things—walking through my apartment, getting a drink of water, or checking my phone—but something always felt slightly off. Like I was observing myself from a distance, instead of really being there.

At first, I brushed it off. I figured it was just my body adjusting to the new medication. After all, Dr. Patel had mentioned that it might take a little while to fully settle in. I went about my days as usual, and for the most part, I was just grateful to finally be getting some sleep.

Then, one night, I had an experience that left me feeling more than a little unsettled. I woke up around 3:00 a.m., needing to use the bathroom. The apartment was completely dark, and as I shuffled down the hallway, I felt like I wasn’t alone.

It’s difficult to explain, but the sensation was strong enough that I found myself looking over my shoulder several times. My heart rate quickened, but I tried to reason with myself that it was just the grogginess from waking up in the middle of the night. I returned to bed and eventually fell back asleep, though I had a lingering feeling that something was off.

The next morning, I laughed at myself for overreacting. After all, it was just a sensation. I’d lived in my apartment for two years without incident. There was no reason to think anything had changed. Besides, it was an old building, and I’d always heard the occasional creak or draft. It wasn’t unusual.

But that night, something similar happened again. I woke up suddenly, no specific reason why. The room was silent, but there was a heaviness in the air, like the atmosphere had thickened somehow. I lay still for a few moments, waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. My mind was racing, trying to identify what had pulled me out of sleep so abruptly.

And then I saw it—just a flicker of movement at the edge of my vision. I turned my head quickly, but there was nothing there. Just my room, the same as always.

It had to be a trick of the mind. My rational brain knew that. I had just woken up, I was half-asleep, and the darkness was playing tricks on me. But it happened again the next night. And the night after that. Every time, it was the same. A flash of movement out of the corner of my eye, and then nothing.

At this point, I started wondering if it was the medication. Maybe it was messing with my perception, causing me to see things that weren’t really there. I decided to skip a dose, just to see if that made any difference.

That night, I struggled to fall asleep without the pill. It was almost as if my body had become reliant on it. I tossed and turned for hours, and when I finally did drift off, it wasn’t restful sleep. When I woke up, I felt worse than before, and I hadn’t escaped the strange sensations either. Even without the medication, I saw that same fleeting movement in the corner of my vision.

It was starting to get to me.

I couldn’t bring myself to call Dr. Patel yet. Maybe I didn’t want to admit that something was wrong, or maybe I thought I could figure it out on my own. Either way, I kept taking the pills, hoping things would smooth out again.

But they didn’t. Instead, they escalated.

The fleeting glimpses out of the corner of my eye became more frequent, and I started hearing faint sounds in the apartment at night. It wasn’t anything specific—just subtle noises like the soft creak of a floorboard or the quiet rustle of fabric. Things that could easily be explained away if I tried hard enough.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

 

I had initially dismissed it, but it’s now gnawing at me. It was that strange kind of paranoia where you know something’s wrong, but you keep trying to convince yourself it’s nothing. I kept thinking, *It’s just the medication.* But as the days passed, it became harder to ignore what I was experiencing.

The visions—those flashes of movement in the corner of my eye—became more distinct. Before, I could tell myself they were just shadows, tricks of the mind. But now, I could swear I was seeing shapes, like figures standing just out of sight. I never got a clear look, and every time I turned my head to focus, they were gone. But that didn't make them feel any less real. In fact, it made them worse.

I started turning on lights whenever I woke up in the middle of the night. The logic was simple: if I could see my surroundings clearly, I wouldn’t feel so unsettled. But even with the lights on, the sensation didn’t go away. If anything, it intensified. The figures might have disappeared when I switched on the lights, but the feeling of not being alone remained. It was almost as if the light itself couldn’t reach every corner of the room.

After a particularly rough night, I made up my mind to call Dr. Patel. I needed to know if the medication could be causing these side effects. Sleep disturbances, paranoia, hallucinations—anything to explain what was happening. I was anxious, but maybe I was also hoping he would reassure me that this was normal. That my mind was just playing tricks on me.

When I finally got through to him, I laid it all out—the dreams, the sensations, the glimpses of movement. I tried to sound as rational as possible, though I wasn’t sure how much of that came through in my voice.

To his credit, Dr. Patel didn’t dismiss my concerns outright. He asked about the specific brand of medication I was taking, double-checked the dosage, and even went over the side effects again. But none of what I described sounded typical to him. He suggested that I stop taking the pills immediately to see if the symptoms went away and scheduled a follow-up appointment for later that week.

I hungup feeling somewhat relieved, but a part of me was skeptical. What if it wasn’t the medication? What if something else was happening? Still, I followed his advice. That night, I didn’t take the pill.

It didn’t help.

In fact, it made things worse. Without the medication, I was back to struggling with insomnia. I spent hours tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep but never quite managing it. And yet, even in the dark, even without the disorienting haze of sleep pulling me under, I kept seeing them.

The shadows.

They weren’t just fleeting glimpses now. It felt like they were *there*, in the room with me, watching. I’d sit up in bed and stare at the doorway or the far corner of the room, where I swore I could see something, a figure standing silently, barely perceptible. I would blink, and it would disappear, but the tension it left behind was unbearable.

One night, after lying awake for what felt like hours, I got up and started pacing the apartment. It wasn’t a conscious decision; it was more like I couldn’t stay still any longer. The silence was oppressive. I needed to move, to do something to shake the feeling that was creeping over me.

I walked to the kitchen, half-thinking that a glass of water would help calm me down. As I reached for a glass in the cupboard, I caught sight of my reflection in the window. It startled me for a moment, seeing movement when I wasn’t expecting it. But what really unnerved me was that, in the reflection, it looked like someone else was standing behind me.

I spun around so quickly I nearly knocked the glass out of my hand, but the kitchen was empty. I tried to laugh it off, telling myself it was a trick of the dim lighting, but my nerves were shot. I didn’t bother with the water. I went back to my room, turned on every light I could, and sat on my bed, trying to breathe slowly, trying to calm down.

The next morning, I was exhausted. It felt like I hadn’t slept at all, and my brain was foggy from the lack of rest. But the worst part was that the sensations weren’t confined to the night anymore. During the day, I began noticing things too. Not visions exactly, but more like the overwhelming sense that someone was standing just behind me, watching. It happened in my apartment, at work, even when I was walking down the street.

I found myself turning around constantly, expecting to catch someone—or something—there, only to be met with empty air. I must have looked ridiculous, jumping at nothing, but it wasn’t something I could control. My rational mind knew that there was no one there, but it didn’t stop the feeling. It was primal, like something deep inside me was screaming that I wasn’t safe.

I couldn’t keep ignoring it. The medication was out of my system now, but the visions and sensations weren’t. It had to be something else. I started researching, spending hours on forums and reading articles about sleep disorders, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. But none of it quite fit. People described similar experiences—visions in the dark, the feeling of being watched—but it didn’t explain why this was happening to me now. Why I felt this constant presence, even during the day, even when I was wide awake.

The more I read, the more convinced I became that I wasn’t hallucinating. This wasn’t just in my head.

That’s when I noticed something strange.

I had been living in my apartment for over two years, and during that time, I hadn’t really given much thought to my neighbors. I saw them occasionally in the hallway, exchanged the usual pleasantries, but we weren’t close. Still, something about my next-door neighbor had always struck me as odd. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was a feeling I got every time I saw him—a kind of unease.

He was quiet, always polite, but I’d noticed that he had strange habits. He rarely left his apartment, and when he did, it was always at odd hours, like in the middle of the night. I’d hear him walking down the hallway, his footsteps barely audible, but distinct in the silence of the building. It never bothered me before, but now I found myself wondering if there was more to it.

Could it be connected? Could he be watching me somehow?

The thought seemed absurd at first, but I couldn’t shake it. I had no real evidence, no reason to think my neighbor had anything to do with the strange occurrences in my apartment. But the idea burrowed itself into my mind, and once it was there, I couldn’t let it go.

I started paying closer attention, watching him whenever I could. And that’s when I realized that something had changed. I couldn’t explain how, but I knew it.

My neighbor was watching me too.

 

The idea that my neighbor might be involved in what was happening felt ridiculous at first. I mean, what could he possibly have to do with my insomnia, the medication, or the strange sensations I was feeling? But once the thought was there, I couldn’t shake it. It wasn’t just that he was quiet and kept to himself—plenty of people are like that—it was something more.

There were little things that, on their own, might have seemed like nothing, but together started forming a pattern. Like how I’d started hearing faint sounds through the wall late at night. It wasn’t loud, just a sort of muffled shuffling, like someone moving around quietly, deliberately. At first, I thought maybe he was just up late, but now I wasn’t so sure. I couldn’t help but wonder what he was doing over there at two or three in the morning, especially when I’d catch glimpses of him leaving his apartment at those same hours.

It didn’t take long for me to start paying more attention to him. I started lingering in the hallway longer when I knew he was coming or going, or keeping an eye on the peephole when I heard him moving outside my door. He never did anything overtly suspicious—no strange packages or anything like that—but there was an intensity in the way he carried himself. His movements were always purposeful, like he was focused on something I couldn’t quite figure out.

And then there were the stares.

I didn’t notice it right away, but eventually, I realized that every time we crossed paths, he would hold my gaze just a little too long. Not in a friendly or even a curious way. It was more like he was trying to figure me out. It unsettled me, but I kept telling myself that I was reading too much into it. After all, I’d been feeling paranoid and on edge for days now. It made sense that I might start looking for a cause, even if there wasn’t one.

Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me, that he knew more than he was letting on.

A few nights later, things took a turn. I was lying in bed, once again struggling to fall asleep, when I heard it: the faint sound of something tapping against the wall. I sat up in bed, listening closely. It wasn’t loud, but it was definitely there. Tap… tap… tap. I stared at the wall, my mind racing. Was it him? Was he trying to get my attention?

I got up and pressed my ear to the wall. The tapping continued for another minute or so, and then it stopped. I stood there for what felt like an eternity, waiting for something else to happen, but the apartment was silent.

I told myself it could have been anything—the pipes, the heating system, even a mouse in the wall—but none of those explanations felt right. It sounded too deliberate, too rhythmic. I didn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I could hear the tapping in my mind, like an echo that wouldn’t go away.

The next day, I decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to find out what was going on. It wasn’t just the insomnia or the strange visions—it was everything. The feeling of being watched, the noises, the way my neighbor always seemed to be lurking just out of sight. It was too much.

I started by doing a little research. I looked up the building’s history, just to see if there was anything strange about it. But there wasn’t. It was a standard apartment building, built in the 1970s, with no reported issues or incidents. The previous tenants seemed normal enough too—just regular people who had come and gone over the years. There was nothing to suggest that anything out of the ordinary had ever happened here.

But that didn’t stop me from feeling like something was wrong.

I knew it sounded paranoid, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that my neighbor was involved somehow. So, I started watching him more closely. I’d stand near my window and peek through the blinds when I knew he was leaving his apartment. I noticed that he always left at odd times, usually late at night or early in the morning, but he never stayed out long. It was like he was doing something in secret—something he didn’t want anyone else to know about.

Then one night, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

I had been watching him leave again, like I had done so many times before, when I noticed something strange. As he walked down the hall, he glanced over his shoulder—directly at my door. I couldn’t see his face clearly, but there was something about the way he looked that made my skin crawl. It was like he knew I was watching him, even though I was behind the blinds. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest, waiting to see what he would do.

And then, just as quickly as he had looked, he turned and continued down the hall, disappearing around the corner.

I didn’t move for a long time. I just stood there, staring at the door, my mind racing. Did he know? Had he known all along that I was watching him? And if so, why hadn’t he said anything? Why hadn’t he confronted me?

The next day, I decided to take things a step further. I couldn’t live like this anymore, constantly on edge, wondering if I was being watched. I needed answers. So, I did something I never thought I’d do: I knocked on his door.

It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I was walking down the hall, trying to gather the courage to confront him, when I found myself standing in front of his apartment. Before I could talk myself out of it, I knocked three times and waited.

At first, there was no response. I started to turn away, embarrassed, thinking maybe he wasn’t home, when the door creaked open.

He stood there, staring at me, his expression unreadable. Up close, I could see that he was older than I had initially thought, with deep-set eyes and graying hair that contrasted sharply with his dark clothing.

“Yes?” he said, his voice low and calm, like nothing was out of the ordinary.

For a moment, I didn’t know what to say. All the rehearsed lines I had prepared vanished from my mind. Finally, I managed to speak.

“I, um… I live next door,” I began, stumbling over my words. “I just wanted to… introduce myself.”

He raised an eyebrow, clearly not expecting that.

We exchanged a few more pleasantries—names, how long we’d lived in the building, the usual small talk. But as we spoke, I kept getting the same feeling I always had around him—that there was something off. His responses were polite, but clipped, like he was hiding something. He didn’t ask me any questions in return, didn’t seem curious about why I was standing at his door. It felt like he wanted to end the conversation as quickly as possible.

Finally, after what felt like an endless wait, I excused myself and returned to my apartment. I didn’t learn anything new from that conversation, but the feeling that something was wrong hadn’t gone away. If anything, it was stronger now.

Something was definitely happening. And I was determined to find out what.

==================

The brief exchange with my neighbor left me feeling more unsettled than before. As much as I had tried to approach him casually, it felt forced—artificial. It was as if we were both playing a part, pretending to be two normal people having an ordinary conversation, when something darker lay just beneath the surface. I couldn’t pinpoint what it was, but my gut told me I was onto something. I just didn’t know what.

I spent the next few days trying to go about my life as usual, but it was impossible to ignore the tension building in the apartment. The noises at night didn’t stop. If anything, they became more frequent. Every night, I would hear that faint tapping through the wall, like someone knocking gently, rhythmically, as if to say, *I’m still here.*

During the day, I found myself looking over my shoulder constantly, feeling like someone was watching me even when I was alone. It had gotten so bad that I started leaving the lights on all the time, day and night, just to try and dispel the uneasy feeling. But the light didn’t help anymore. The shadows felt like they were always there, lurking just out of reach, waiting.

I wasn’t sleeping well, either. The medication was out of my system, but I was back to where I started—wide awake for hours at night, my mind racing, unable to relax. But now, on top of the insomnia, I had this gnawing sense of dread that wouldn’t leave me. Every time I closed my eyes, I could feel it—the presence. Like someone was standing right there beside my bed, just beyond my vision.

I couldn’t take it anymore.

I decided that if I was going to get to the bottom of this, I needed to take a more direct approach. Watching my neighbor through the blinds and listening to strange sounds at night wasn’t going to give me the answers I needed. I had to dig deeper. And that’s when I came up with an idea—one that made me nervous just thinking about it.

I was going to break into his apartment.

It wasn’t a decision I made lightly. I knew it was illegal, and if I got caught, I’d be in serious trouble. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was happening—whatever I was experiencing—it had something to do with him. The way he moved around at odd hours, the way he seemed to know more than he let on, the tapping through the wall. It all pointed to him.

I needed proof. And I was determined to find it.

I spent the next few days preparing. I kept an eye on his schedule, making note of when he left and when he returned. It wasn’t hard to figure out; he kept to a pretty consistent routine. Most nights, he would leave his apartment around midnight and wouldn’t return until close to 3 a.m. That gave me a window of a few hours to get in and out without being caught.

When the night finally came, I was a bundle of nerves. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I waited until I heard his door close and his footsteps fade down the hall before I moved. I had already scoped out the lock on his door—it was old, and I was confident I could get it open with a credit card. I wasn’t exactly a locksmith, but I had watched a few videos online, and this didn’t seem too complicated.

I crept out into the hallway, every sound magnified in the silence of the building. My hands were shaking as I slid the card between the door and the frame, jiggling it slightly until I heard a soft click. The door creaked open, and I froze, listening for any sign that someone had heard me. But the hallway remained silent.

I stepped inside.

His apartment was almost identical to mine in layout, but it felt completely different. The air was heavier somehow, like it hadn’t been disturbed in a long time. The lights were off, but the streetlamp outside cast just enough light through the windows for me to see. The furniture was sparse—barely anything beyond a couch, a table, and a few chairs. There were no decorations, no photos, no personal touches. It felt cold, impersonal, like no one really lived there.

I made my way carefully through the apartment, my footsteps barely making a sound on the old wooden floor. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for, but I figured if there was something strange going on, I would know it when I saw it. I started in the living room, checking the drawers and cabinets, but there was nothing unusual—just the normal clutter you’d expect to find in someone’s apartment.

Then I moved to the bedroom.

The door was slightly open, and as I pushed it wider, my stomach churned. The room was darker than the rest of the apartment, and I had to strain my eyes to see anything clearly. There was a bed against the far wall, neatly made, but nothing else in the room stood out. I was about to leave when I noticed something odd—a small door on the opposite side of the room, half-hidden behind a tall bookshelf.

It was a closet door, but it looked different from the ones in my apartment. For one thing, it had a padlock on it.

That’s when I knew I had found what I was looking for.

I crouched down, examining the lock. It wasn’t anything special, just a cheap combination lock you could buy at any hardware store. I pulled out my phone and used the flashlight to get a better look. There were scratches around the lock, like someone had tried to force it open before.

I didn’t have the tools to break the lock, but I wasn’t about to give up. I tried a few random combinations, but the lock didn’t budge. Frustrated, I stood up and backed away from the door, trying to think. Maybe there was something else in the apartment that could give me a clue—something that would help me figure out what was inside.

I turned back to the bedroom and started searching more thoroughly. I pulled open drawers, looked under the bed, even checked the pockets of jackets hanging in the closet. And that’s when I found it—a small notebook, tucked away in the bottom drawer of the nightstand.

I flipped it open, and what I saw made my skin crawl.

The notebook was filled with pages and pages of writing, but it wasn’t ordinary writing. It was like someone had been keeping a detailed log of… me. There were notes about my schedule, my habits, even my conversations. Entries like “Left for work at 8:10 a.m.,” “Returned home at 6:45 p.m.,” “Went to bed at 11:00 p.m.” It was all there, down to the smallest detail.

But the most unsettling part was the recent entries. They were about my insomnia, about me waking up in the middle of the night, and about me seeing shadows. Whoever had written this knew exactly what I was experiencing. It was like they were watching me, waiting for me to break.

I snapped the notebook shut, my hands trembling. I didn’t know what to think. Had my neighbor been spying on me this whole time? And if so, why? What was the point?

I stuffed the notebook in my pocket and hurried out of the apartment, my mind racing with questions. I didn’t care about being quiet anymore. I needed to get out of there. I needed to figure out what was going on.

As I locked his door behind me and stepped back into my apartment, I realized something chilling.

The tapping on the wall—it had never been a random noise. It had been him, all along.

 

I barely slept after that night. My thoughts were a storm of confusion and fear. The notebook, the strange sensations, the tapping on the wall—it was all too much to process. And yet, the more I thought about it, the less sense it made. Why would my neighbor be keeping notes on me? How had he known so much about my insomnia and the shadows I was seeing? The whole thing felt like a bad dream, one I couldn’t wake up from.

The next morning, I knew I had to go back to Dr. Patel. Something was wrong, not just with my neighbor, but with me. It felt like I was losing my grip on reality. The lack of sleep, the paranoia, the hallucinations—because that’s what they were, weren’t they? Hallucinations. It was the only explanation that made any sense.

When I arrived at Dr. Patel’s office, I was a mess. My eyes were bloodshot, my hands were trembling, and I could barely string a sentence together. He took one look at me and led me into his office without asking any questions.

“I need to talk to you,” I said, my voice shaky. “I think there’s something seriously wrong with me.”

Dr. Patel listened as I recounted everything—how the insomnia had turned into something worse, how I’d started seeing things and feeling like I was being watched. I told him about the tapping, the shadows, the notebook, and even my neighbor. The words spilled out of me in a rush, like I had been holding them back for too long.

He frowned as I talked, and by the time I finished, he looked genuinely concerned.

“This isn’t normal,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “I think the medication might be making it worse.”

Dr. Patel sighed and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his desk. “I’m glad you came to me,” he said, his voice calm but serious. “Because I think we need to address something that I missed before.”

I felt a jolt of fear. “What do you mean?”

He clicked a few keys on his computer and scanned the screen for a moment before turning back to me. “It seems there’s been a mistake with your prescription.”

I blinked, not quite understanding what he was saying. “A mistake?”

“The pharmacy gave you the wrong medication,” he explained. “Instead of the sleep aid I prescribed, they accidentally gave you something used to treat schizophrenia and other severe mental health conditions. It’s a powerful antipsychotic, and in someone without those conditions, it can cause serious side effects—including hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking.”

For a moment, I didn’t speak. I just stared at him, trying to process what he was telling me. The wrong medication? Antipsychotics? It didn’t seem real.

“So… you’re saying that everything I’ve been experiencing…” I trailed off, my heart pounding in my chest.

“It’s very likely that the medication caused your symptoms,” he said gently. “The insomnia, the paranoia, the visions—they could all be explained by the side effects of the wrong drug. Your body’s reaction to it, combined with the stress of not sleeping, created a perfect storm.”

I felt a wave of relief, but it was quickly followed by a deep, unsettling dread. If the medication was to blame, then none of it had been real. The shadows, the tapping, my neighbor’s strange behavior—it was all in my head. My mind had been playing tricks on me, twisting reality into something nightmarish.

But then, something didn’t sit right.

“The notebook,” I said, my voice shaky. “What about the notebook? It had all these details about my life, my schedule. How could that have been a hallucination?”

Dr. Patel looked at me with sympathy. “The mind can create convincing scenarios when it’s under duress, especially with the influence of the wrong medication. It’s possible that you found an ordinary notebook and your mind filled in the blanks.”

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to accept that this was all just a terrible mistake—a side effect of the wrong medication. But something deep inside me couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to it.

I left his office with a new prescription, this time for the correct medication, and a plan to slowly wean off the antipsychotics. He assured me that once the wrong drug was out of my system, the hallucinations and paranoia would stop.

But as I walked home, the relief I should have felt never fully arrived. Instead, I kept replaying everything that had happened, over and over in my mind. The tapping, the feeling of being watched, the unsettling moments where I had seen figures out of the corner of my eye.

Had it all been in my head? Or was there something more?

When I reached my apartment, I stood in front of my neighbor’s door for a long time. Everything felt different now. If the medication had been messing with my mind, then maybe he wasn’t watching me after all. Maybe I had imagined it all.

But as I turned to go into my apartment, something stopped me cold.

The tapping.

It was faint, but it was there, coming from the wall between our apartments. Tap… tap… tap. The same sound I had heard so many nights before.

I stood frozen in place, my heart racing. I told myself it was just my imagination, that the medication was still affecting me. But the sound continued, steady and deliberate.

I couldn’t help myself. I moved toward the wall and pressed my ear against it, listening.

Tap… tap… tap.

And then, just as I was about to pull away, I heard something else. A voice. Low, almost a whisper, coming from the other side of the wall.

“I’ve been watching you.”

I stopped breathing for a second, stumbling back as my pulse raced in my ears. The tapping stopped, and the apartment fell into silence.

I stood there, frozen, my mind racing. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. Dr. Patel had said it was all in my head. The medication, the paranoia, the hallucinations—it was all a mistake.

But as I looked at the wall, the silence pressing in around me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe…

It wasn’t.

 

**Or was it?**
