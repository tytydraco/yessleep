Without even thinking, I launch myself towards the grenade, every muscle tensed for the desperate attempt to save Tuyet and the boy Luc.

But before my fingers can grasp its cold metal, Văn surges past, shoving me out of the way.

"Get down!" he bellows. In one fluid motion, he grabs the grenade, intent on hurling it back towards our attackers.

But he’s not fast enough. The grenade detonates in his hand. The explosion is deafening, a blast of heat and shrapnel that tears through the air. Văn is thrown backward, his body a ragdoll caught in the blast's merciless embrace.

The shockwave reverberates through my bones, my ears ringing, my vision blurred. When the dust settles, the air is filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood.

My heart hammers in my chest as I crawl over to where Văn lies prone on the floor.

“Van!” I cry out.

At first glance, Văn seems miraculously intact, almost sleeping. But the illusion shatters as I turn him over. His right forearm is gone, severed by the blast. Shrapnel wounds pepper his body. Half his face is missing, obliterated in an instant.

His eyes flutter open, a glimmer of consciousness piercing through the haze of pain.

His gaze falls on the bloody stump where his right arm once was. He attempts a weak, lopsided smile.

"At least... it wasn't my left arm…" he rasps, his voice a barely audible whisper. He lifts his left hand, the one bearing his wedding ring.

His breaths come shallow and ragged, each one a battle. I lean in closer, my hand finding his.

Tuyết crawls over to my side. Together, we attempt to administer first aid, but Van is too far gone.

Tears blur my vision as I grip Văn's remaining hand, my voice breaking. "Why? Why would you do something so fucking stupid?"

He coughs, a faint chuckle escaping his lips despite the agony he must be in. "Because... you can't throw for shit," he manages to say.

His fingers, still warm, squeeze mine."Tell... tell Hạnh..." he starts. But the words trail off, unfinished, as the light in his eyes dims. A final, labored exhale escapes his lips, and then nothing.

I gently remove Văn's dog tags, the metal cool and heavy in my hand. My fingers find the wedding ring on his left hand, slipping it off with a reverence that feels like a prayer. In his pockets, I discover a worn letter, the edges frayed from being read and folded countless times. Beside it, is a photo of Văn, his wife Lan, and their little daughter Hạnh, smiling, a moment of happiness frozen in time.

The whizz of a bullet, cutting through the air mere centimeters from my head, jolts me back to the present.

Scanning the room for any advantage, my gaze falls on a control panel mounted on the wall, its interface glowing dimly. A biometric scanner sits beside it.

I glance at the lifeless body of the scientist, an idea sparking amidst the despair. I drag his corpse closer, the blood from his wounds leaving a dark trail on the tiled floor. "Tuyết," I call over the din of gunfire, "I need his hand."

Her eyes wide with horror before nodding grimly. Without a word, she pulls out her machete, its blade gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. With a swift motion, she hacks at the scientist's hand, the sound of bone and sinew giving way under the blade echoing sickeningly.

"Cover me!" I shout, snatching up the severed hand and making a mad dash for the control panel. Bullets fly past, the air alive with the deadly song of gunfire. I can feel the heat of the shots as they slice through the space where I was just moments before.

Halfway to the panel, a bullet tears through my shoulder, the impact knocking me off balance. I stagger, nearly dropping the gruesome key to our escape. The pain is immediate and searing, a hot iron pressed into my flesh.

“Đụ mẹ nó!” (Motherfucker!) I curse, pushing through it.

Reaching the panel, I press the dead scientist's hand against the biometric scanner. The machine whirs, processing the grisly input. After a moment that stretches into eternity, the scanner beeps in affirmation, the light turning green.

My eyes frantically search the control panel's interface. Among the myriad buttons and switches, one stands out, marked with a series of numbers that correspond to the mutant elephant's enclosure. Without hesitation, I press it.

The heavy steel doors to the elephant's enclosure groan as they begin to slide open, the sound a harbinger of the chaos to come. The soldiers, momentarily distracted by this new development, shift their focus toward the source of the noise as they try to process the unfolding scene.

From the darkness of the enclosure, the mutated elephant emerges. The tumors and growths that mar its skin seem to pulse with a malevolent energy, and its tentacle-like limb whips through the air with a mind of its own.

As the creature steps into the light, a palpable sense of dread fills the room. The soldiers, trained to face human enemies, find themselves frozen in terror at the sight of this monstrosity. Their hesitation costs them dearly.

With a trumpeting roar that shakes the very foundations of the laboratory, the creature charges. Its massive body moves with a terrifying speed. The soldiers open fire, but their bullets seem to do little more than enrage the beast further.

The elephant's first victim is caught squarely by the charging monster, his body crushed beneath its immense weight with a sickening crunch. The creature's tentacle limb lashes out, wrapping around another soldier and tossing him aside like a toy. His screams are cut short as he collides with the wall, his body breaking upon impact.

Its trunk, split and lined with teeth, snaps up a third man, lifting him into the air before biting down. The sound of breaking bones and tearing flesh is almost drowned out by the chaos of the room.

"Move! Move!" I yell, firing a burst of covering fire.

We make our break for the service tunnel, elephant’s rampage providing the distraction we desperately need.

Tuyết grabs Luc, and we make a break for it, dodging between lab benches and equipment. Her movements are shadowed by Hùng and Lam, who fire off a suppressing volley towards the soldiers trying to regroup.

Then, a soldier, torn in half but horrifically alive, is hurled into our path, his eyes wide with shock and agony. Without pausing, I sidestep the dying man.

We dart into a narrow hallway, the sounds of its rampage a constant threat at our backs.

As we spill into the service tunnel, the chaos of the lab behind us, Hung catches sight of my shoulder. “Fuck, Thành, you're hit!" he exclaims, a note of panic in his voice.

I glance down, almost surprised to see blood soaking through my shirt, the fabric clinging to my skin. The pain, masked by adrenaline until now, flares into sharp focus, a white-hot lance through my shoulder. "I'm fine," I lie, gritting my teeth against the pain.

Tuyết, catching the grimace of pain that I can't quite hide, orders, "Sit, now!" Despite my instinct to keep moving, I find myself obeying, slumping against the cold wall.

Hung rummages through his pack, producing a first aid kit. Its contents are spilled out in a practiced motion, gauze, bandages, and small vials of morphine coming to rest on the concrete floor beside me.

Lâm kneels beside me, his fingers probing the wound with a gentle precision. "Bullet's still in there," he mutters, more to himself than to me.

Hùng and Tuyết work in tandem, cleaning the wound. The sting of antiseptic bites into my flesh, drawing a hiss of pain through clenched teeth. Tuyết's hands are steady as she bandages the wound.

As the adrenaline begins to ebb, the true extent of the pain crashes into me like a tidal wave. It's a searing, pulsating agony that radiates from my shoulder, each heartbeat a reminder of the injury.

I can't help but let out a muffled curse, my grip on the cold floor of the tunnel tightening.

"Sorry," Tuyết murmurs. "Almost done here."

"I need morphine," I demand, the words barely a growl through gritted teeth. My tolerance for pain has its limits, and I'm rapidly approaching them.

"Alright, but just a little bit," Lam says, prepping the syringe. "Don't need you passing out on us."

With a quick jab, he administers the shot, the morphine entering my system. The relief is almost immediate, a warm wave that dulls the pain to a manageable throb.

"Alright, can you stand?" Tuyết asks.

With a grunt, I push myself up, the tunnel swaying slightly around me. "Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here," I say, my voice steadier than I feel.

The cold hits us like a wall, the temperature plummeting as we delve deeper into the bowels of the cold storage facility. Our breaths fog in the frigid air, ghostly puffs that fade into the expanse ahead. The facility is a cavernous space, shelves stacked to the ceiling with ominous canisters, each one marked with warnings of biological hazards.

As we move cautiously through the aisles, the sounds of frantic activity reach us. Soldiers and lab personnel scurry about, loading the canisters onto heavy-duty trucks parked at loading bays. The canisters are stenciled with the words: ‘Agent Indigo.’

At the end of one aisle, a maintenance ladder is bolted to the wall, leading up to a narrow catwalk that runs the length of the storage area, crisscrossing overhead.

We make a beeline for that ladder, moving as quietly as a group of heavily armed, slightly banged-up commandos possibly can. It's like some twisted game of hide and seek, with stakes much higher than any of us would like. Tuyet, with Luc clinging to his back like a little monkey, goes first. The kid's got a tight grip, but I can't help but admire her silence through all this. Kid's got guts.

As we navigate the precarious catwalks above, the cold air bites at our exposed skin. The metal underfoot groans with every step. From this vantage point, we have a clear view of the facility's interior workings, a hive of activity.

Below us, snippets of conversation that float up are tense, filled with urgency.

"Dr. Archer, the President wants Grim Harvest and Agent Indigo buried," a voice asserts, the tone icy. "No evidence. No loose ends.”

"To hell with Nixon," another voice, who I assume Dr. Archer’s, growls. "The only thing that matters now is securing Subject Lyra.”

Peering over the edge, I catch sight of a group of soldiers maneuvering a peculiar sight through the aisles below—what looks like a metal coffin, its surface sleek and unyielding, rigged with an array of complex machinery that hums with a life of its own.

Through a small, reinforced view window on top of the coffin, a deathly pale young woman is visible. She lies still, so still you'd think she was dead if not for the faint mist that clouds the glass with each shallow breath she takes. Her features are serene, almost angelic, but there's something unsettling about the way she's encased, like a specimen preserved for study rather than rest.

As the soldiers fumble with the coffin, their movements clumsy in their haste, Dr. Archer’s voice cuts through the chaos, like a knife slicing through the buzz of activity.

"Careful with her! She's more valuable than all of you put together."

I stick my head out a bit more, my grip on the cold metal of the catwalk tightening as my eyes find the source of the commanding voice. It’s an older man, his attire more civilian than military. A chill down my spine as I see the deep, jagged scars etched into his face, stretching his mouth into a permanent smile. This Dr. Archer is the Smiling Man Luc mentioned.

The Smiling Man approaches the metallic coffin. He places a hand gently on the glass, leaning in close as if sharing a secret with the still form inside.

"Don't worry, Lyra," he murmurs, his voice barely audible above the din. "We'll bring you back. We're so close now."

We don’t waste any more time gawking as we move on.

Suddenly, a sharp, piercing alarm cuts through the facility, a harsh wail that echoes off the metal and concrete.

Over the loudspeaker, a voice, cool and detached, announces, "Attention all personnel: intruders have been detected within the premises. They are to be considered armed and dangerous. Initiate lockdown protocol immediately."

It's like watching ants when you poke their hill. Soldiers and lab workers alike snap to attention, their movements becoming more frenetic. Doors slam shut, heavy metallic thuds that echo ominously through the vast space, while soldiers scramble to barricade exits, their rifles at the ready.

Our escape route, a mere whisper of hope moments ago, seems to be slipping away with each clanging echo of steel on steel.

"Shit," I hiss under my breath, the word a cloud of vapor in the cold. We're boxed in, the catwalk offering a bird's-eye view of a trap snapping shut.

But then, eyes darting around in desperation, I spot it—our slim chance. Far across the opposite end, a maintenance door. It's barely visible, tucked away like a secret, but it’s a shot. But getting there would be like crossing no-man's land in broad daylight. We need a distraction, something big, chaotic enough to turn every head away from that door.

My gaze snags on a monstrosity of machinery, pipes, and tanks, all connected in a way that screams 'important'. And nestled among them, a large rack filled with canisters of Agent Indigo.

I catch Hùng's eye, gesturing subtly to the machinery with a tilt of my head. He nods, understanding flashing in his gaze.

With a swift, silent command, I signal Tuyết and Lâm to keep low and move Luc to a safer position.

Hùng, meanwhile, carefully shoulders his RPG. The weapon seems almost comically large in the cramped space of the catwalk. He waits for my signal, his eyes locked on mine, a silent question hanging between us. Are we really doing this?

I give a curt nod, the decision made. There's no going back now.

Hùng aims the RPG at the heart of the Agent Indigo storage system. The room below us is a beehive of activity, oblivious to the storm about to break over them.

The RPG's roar is deafening, a sound that ricochets off the walls with physical force. Time seems to slow as the rocket arcs through the air like a deadly comet.

The impact is like the hand of God coming down. The explosion is a hellish bloom of fire and shrapnel, tearing through the machinery and igniting the Agent Indigo.

The resulting inferno is a thing of terrible beauty, a whirlwind of blue flames that dance with a life of their own.

The explosion sets off a chain reaction that rips through the facility like a wrathful storm. The base's personnel, caught in the middle of their frantic preparations, don't stand a chance. The blue flames spread with a hungry intensity, engulfing everything in their path. It's like watching hell expand, the fire consuming flesh and metal alike without distinction or mercy.

With the facility descending into pandemonium, the screams of the trapped and burning are a haunting chorus that I know will haunt my dreams. But worse than the screams are the groans—low, guttural sounds that begin to rise above the crackle of flames. The dead, or whatever's left of them in this twisted place, are waking up.

As the undead draw closer, we make a desperate dash up a set of stairs leading to the maintenance door, our only chance of escape. Reaching the door, I see it’s locked, the biometric pad blinking mockingly in the dim light.

I retrieve the severed hand from my pack. Pressing the grotesque key against the pad, yielding nothing but a blinking red light in refusal. "Fuck!" I curse.

"I think… the hand's too cold. The scanner can't read it," Tuyết observes, her voice strained.

In a frenzied attempt to warm the severed hand, I rub my hands over its cold, lifeless flesh. My breath clouds in the frigid air as I blow warm air onto the hand, desperately hoping to trick the scanner into recognizing it.

But it's not enough. The scanner remains unresponsive.

Lâm, thinking quickly, grabs the hand. “Let me try something.” He tucks it under his arm, trying to transfer his body heat to the lifeless flesh.

"Need some help here!" Hung shouts, his rifle's muzzle flashing as he fires into the advancing horror.

I whirl around just in time to see two smoldering undead soldiers, their uniforms charred and their flesh seething with blue flames, charging up the stairs towards us.

I raise my rifle, taking aim at the closest one. The bullets tear through the approaching undead, stopping it in its tracks.

Before I can fully register the threat, the second undead soldier closes the gap, its burned body pressed against me, its jaw snapping at my face. The stench of charred flesh and death is overwhelming, nearly choking me. In a panic-driven reflex, I fumble for the Makarov at my side, yanking it free from its holster.

With the creature's grotesque face looming over mine, I jam the muzzle of the pistol under its jaw and squeeze the trigger. The shot reverberates sharply in the confined space. The creature's head snaps back, its body going limp before collapsing in a heap at my feet.

But there's no time to catch my breath. The sounds of more approaching undead grow louder.

"Hurry up!" I shout back.

“Here goes nothing!” Lam says, pressing the hand against the scanner again. This time, after a tense moment, the light blinks green, and with a heavy metallic click, the door unlocks.

Tuyết and Luc rush through first. Lâm and Hùng follow.

As I stand at the threshold, my gaze catches the sight of at least half a dozen undead shambling up the bottom of the staircase.

I pull a grenade from my belt, the pin between my fingers. With a last glance at the horror we're fleeing, I toss it down the staircase, the small cylinder of death tumbling end over end towards the advancing undead.

I don't wait to see the explosion. The moment the grenade leaves my hand, I turn and slam the door shut. The thud of the door is followed by the muffled boom of the grenade, the shockwave reverberating through the door and into my bones.

I take a deep breath, allowing myself a moment to steady my racing heart. Then, with a nod to my team, we move on.

We follow a corridor lit only by emergency lights that leads us to the loading bay, a large, open space filled with crates and vehicles. The far end of the bay opens up to a pair of heavy metal doors, standing ajar, revealing the dark outline of a courtyard beyond. It’s the exit that promises freedom from this nightmarish ordeal.

But our relief is short-lived. As we draw nearer, the unmistakable sound of helicopter rotors stops us in our tracks. We press ourselves against the cold walls. I motion to keep low.

Peering around the corner, the sight that greets us tightens the knot of dread in my stomach. The Smiling Man, flanked by a squad of heavily armed soldiers, stands at the threshold of our only way out. They are preparing the coffin-like container for transport.

His voice cuts through the air, sharp and commanding. "We need to get Lyra to the Chinook, now. This place is lost."

One of the soldiers, burdened with heavy equipment, turns to him. "Sir, there's not going to be room for you," he says, his voice laced with an urgency that borders on panic.

Archer's reaction is chilling in its indifference. "I don't care," he snaps, his gaze never leaving the coffin. "As long as she makes it, nothing else matters."

As the group wheels the coffin towards the awaiting Chinook in the courtyard, the sound of its rotors beating against the air grows louder. The soldiers begin to close the heavy steel doors behind them, threatening to seal us inside with the nightmare we've unleashed.

Realizing time is slipping through our fingers like sand, I signal to my team.

Without hesitation, we break cover, rushing towards the doors with the desperation of the damned. Our footsteps echo loudly, a drumbeat to our frantic sprint.

The soldiers, caught by surprise, react with trained efficiency, turning their weapons towards us. Bullets whiz past, close enough to singe the air.

Tuyết, still protecting Luc, falls behind me, her movements hampered by the need to shield him. Lâm and Hùng flank her, providing cover fire.

As we close the distance, the doors begin to inch shut, the finality of it like a death knell. I surge forward, throwing caution to the wind, firing my AK-47 in controlled bursts.

A bullet grazes my thigh, a line of fire that almost buckles my knees. I grit my teeth against the pain, pushing through it.

But it's too late. With a resounding clang, the doors slam shut.

Kicking at the doors proves futile; the heavy steel doesn't even budge under the assault of our boots and shoulders. The sounds of the undead grow closer, a cacophony of groans and dragging feet encroaching from three directions.

I reach into my pack, my fingers finding the cold, malleable block of Semtex. Lâm joins me as we work to set the charges, a race against the relentless advance of the undead. The corridors echo with their hungry moans, a chilling soundtrack to our desperate efforts.

Lâm presses the plastic explosive along the doors' seams. I wire the charges, connecting them to a detonator. Our audience, the undead, draws ever closer, their disjointed limbs casting long, grotesque shadows that stretch towards us.

Tuyết and Hùng stand ready, their weapons aimed at the encroaching horde. Luc clings to Tuyết, his small body pressed against hers.

“Ready,” I say, connecting the last wire.

Finding cover behind a nearby pillar, we brace for the explosion. With a deep breath, I press the detonator. The blast is a thunderclap, the sound rolling over us.

Dust and debris fill the air, a blinding, choking cloud. As it clears, we see the doors, now twisted pieces of metal, blown clear off their hinges.

We surge through the gaping maw into the open, the night air cool against our sweat-drenched faces. The eviscerated bodies of soldiers, caught in the blast, are strewn about.

Among the carnage, a gravely injured soldier, barely more than a boy, reaches tremblingly for his dropped weapon. Our eyes meet, a momentary connection. I raise my rifle and fire, the shot swift and merciful. The soldier slumps, his struggle ending in a silent exhale.

The courtyard, bathed in the harsh light of the Chinook's spotlights, feels like a stage set for our final act.

The Chinook, its twin rotors whipping the air into a frenzy, begins to lift off, carrying its precious cargo away from the madness below.

I bark a command to Hùng, "Take it down!"

Hùng quickly loads a fresh rocket into the launcher. But just as he aligns his sight with the fleeing helicopter, a weak voice pierces the din. "Please, don't! I beg you…"

It's Dr. Archer, the Smiling Man, emerging from beneath a pile of rubble, his body a map of wounds and his face smeared with blood.

I ignore Archer's pleas, turning my gaze back to Hùng. "Do it," I say, my voice steady.

But then he speaks again, his voice cracking with emotion. "My daughter... she's on board. Please, don't do this."

The revelation stirs a turmoil within me, a storm of conflicting emotions.

"Hold your fire!" I shout, my voice cutting through the chaos. Hùng wavers, the launcher still aimed skyward, a look of confusion on his face.

I approach Archer, the barrel of my rifle pressing coldly against his forehead. His eyes, bloodshot and desperate, lock onto mine. "My daughter, Lyra... was a frontline nurse. She was killed at Khe Sanh," he gasps, his voice a shattered whisper. "This... Agent Indigo... was my attempt to bring her back."

"You used it on innocent civilians," I snap back, the weight of what we've witnessed, the horrors unleashed by his obsession, fueling my anger.

Archer's gaze falters, his voice a murmur of broken justifications. "I had to weaponize it... it was the only way they would fund my research. It was for her... all for her."

The conflict rages within me, a storm of empathy and revulsion.

Hung's voice slices through the tension, urgent and clear. "Now or never, Thành!"

Archer, his voice breaking with desperation, pleads, "Please, do what you want with me, but let Lyra go. She's innocent in all of this."

The conflict within me rages, Archer's plea echoing in my ears. I look to Hung, seeing the readiness in his eyes, the launcher still aimed at the sky where the Chinook hovers, a shrinking silhouette against the night.

I take a deep breath, feeling the weight of the moment settle upon my shoulders. Every fiber of my being screams for justice, for retribution for the horrors we've witnessed, for the lives lost and irrevocably altered by Archer's madness.

But then I think of Lyra, another victim out of countless victims of this senseless war.

"Stand down, Hùng," I order, my voice steady but laden with an unseen weight.

Hung hesitates, his gaze flicking between me and the Chinook, then slowly lowers the RPG.

Archer slumps, relief and resignation mingling in his expression. "Thank you," he whispers, the fight draining out of him.

I keep my rifle trained on him. "You still need to reap what you sewed…" I tell him, my voice cold and devoid of sympathy.

“Move out!” I command, turning away from Archer, who now looks utterly defeated.

We start moving, quickly and quietly, back into the dark embrace of the jungle. Behind us, the groans and shuffling footsteps of the undead grow louder.

The Smiling Man's screams are drowned out by the growls and snarls of his own creation. I don't look back.

—

The return to Tuyết's village is a silent procession, each step heavy with the weight of what we've endured. The villagers' eyes, wide with a mixture of fear and hope, follow us as we make our way through the narrow dirt paths that criss-cross the rice fields, now shrouded in the soft light of dawn.

The sight of Lực, safe in Tuyết's arms, sparks a collective sigh of relief that ripples through the crowd. His mom rushes forward, tears streaming down her face, as she takes him into her arms. The reunion is a moment of pure, unadulterated joy amidst the pain and loss.

The villagers' initial wariness of us, the armed strangers, fades as they welcome you as heroes.

After washing away the grime and the vestiges of death that clung to our skin, the villagers invite us to join them for a communal meal. It's a somber affair. There's an undercurrent of grief for those lost and a quiet gratitude for the lives spared.

During the meal, Tuyết's hand finds mine beneath the rough-hewn table. Her fingers interlace with mine, squeezing tight. It’s a cathartic gesture that binds us closer than any words could.

We quietly excuse ourselves from the communal table, slipping away into the cool evening. I leave first, followed by Tuyet, as to not draw any unwanted attention.

Tuyết leads me to a small, secluded hut on the edge of the village. The air between us is thick with unspoken emotions.

As we step inside the dimly lit interior, the door closing behind us with a soft click, the silence becomes almost palpable. We sit there, less than a meter apart, neither of us finding the words to breach the distance between us. My heart races, pounding against my ribs with the same ferocity it did when we were surrounded by the undead. Except now there's no gunfire, no screams, just the quiet night that envelopes the both of us. I start whistling a tune to help ease my nerves.

Tuyết breaks the silence, a slight smile curving her lips. "That’s the same tune you were whistling when we were in the tunnels…”

I chuckle, a bit embarrassed. "Yeah, sorry, it's a nervous tick, I guess. Keeps my mind focused."

"It sounds nice," she says, her gaze holding mine. "What's the song called?"

"'Flowers in Your Hair,'" I reply. "I heard it at a dance I attended a while back. Never knew the band, but the song stuck with me."

Tuyết's laughter, light and unexpected, fills the space between us, cutting through the tension. "You dance?" she teases, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "I never took you for a dancer."

I can't help but smile, feeling a warmth that has little to do with the humid air of the hut. "A little," I admit. "I'm no Lê Ngọc Cẩn, but I've been known to hold my own on the dance floor."

Tuyet nervously twists one of her braided pigtails around her finger, an action that betrays her uncertainty. "Could you... maybe show me a few steps?”

The request takes me by surprise, but the earnestness in her eyes makes it impossible to refuse. "Sure," I say, my voice steadier than I feel. "It's easy, really."

Standing up, I extend my hand towards her, an invitation. “May I have this dance?”

Tuyết smiles, gingerly placing her hand in mine, her touch light as a feather. I guide her into my arms, conscious of the space between us, of her warmth and the faint scent of jasmine that seems to cling to her skin.

With a gentle pressure on her back, I lead her into the first step, the movement tentative at first. "Just follow my lead," I murmur, our steps slowly finding a rhythm of their own. There's no music, just the sound of our footsteps on the wooden floor and the distant hum of the village at night.

As we move together in the dim oil lamplight of the hut, the world outside fades away. For a moment, it's just the two of us, lost in a dance of our own making. My gaze drops to meet hers, and I find myself truly seeing her for the first time since we met.

I’m struck by her beauty. The faint glow of the lantern illuminates her features, casting a soft light that plays across her face, highlighting her fair complexion, her freckled cheek, and the gentle curve of her lips. Her dark eyes, framed by long, thick lashes, hold mine with an intensity that sends a shiver down my spine. I can feel the warmth of her breath against my skin, her heart beating in sync with mine.

As we sway to the rhythm of our own hearts, I find myself leaning in. Her eyes widen in surprise, but she doesn't pull away, instead, she meets me halfway, her lips pressing gently against mine.

Without a word, we begin to strip away the layers of clothing that separate us, eager to feel skin against skin. It's a slow, almost reverent process, each movement deliberate as we take in every centimeter of each other's exposed bodies.

We stumble back towards the small cot in the corner, our bodies entwined as we lose ourselves in each other. Neither of us really knows what we’re doing. We just do what feels right.

We both know that what we're doing is reckless. But in the moment, we don't really care. Our world is literally on fire, and neither of us knows if we'll live to see tomorrow. What do we have to lose?

—

As the first rays of dawn seep through the curtains, casting a soft glow within the hut, I stir gently. Tuyet, peacefully asleep in my arms, breathes softly. I take a moment to watch her sleep, memorizing the details, knowing that it may be the last time I see them.

Carefully, I extricate myself from her embrace, ensuring not to disturb her rest. She murmurs something in her sleep, a soft smile on her lips. I cover her with a thin blanket, tucking it around her shoulders. I silently dress and step outside.

Rejoining Lâm and Hùng in their hut, they give me a somber smile. They're already up, quietly packing their own gear, each movement heavy with the unspoken weight of what's to come. We work in silence, the kind that's loud with all the things better left unsaid.

Once I'm done packing, I do a final check, ensuring everything is secured. I pull out the black and white family photo I've kept tucked away.

While looking at it, an idea strikes me, a gesture that feels like necessary for a proper goodbye. Carefully, I tear myself out of the photo, the rip sound echoing louder in the morning stillness than I expected.

As I'm folding the larger piece of photo to tuck into my pocket, I hear a stirring at the doorway. Turning, I see Tuyết, breathless as if she's been sprinting. Relief floods her features when she sees me. "Thanh! I was afraid I'd just missed you," she says.

I step towards her, the torn photo of myself in my hand. "I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye," I tell her.

As I extend the torn photo towards Tuyết, she hesitates for a moment before reaching into her pocket. She pulls out a similarly torn photo, this one of herself, seemingly torn from a larger picture as well.

Our fingers touch briefly as we exchange our photos. It's a bittersweet moment, filled with the unspoken promises and regrets of what might have been.

As I glance back at Lâm and Hùng. "Give us a moment?" I ask, my voice softer than usual. They nod in understanding.

Hùng, with a playful grin, says, “Try to send him back to us in one piece.”

“Yeah, we've grown quite fond of him,” Lam jokes. “Despite how damn ugly he is.”

Tuyet chuckles, a spark of light in her eyes. "I'll do my best, but I'm not making any promises."

“Take care, you two. Never change who you are,” she says, giving each of them a hug.

“You too, sister,” Hung replies.

Lâm places a hand on my shoulder, squeezing it lightly. "Take as much time as you need."

"Thanks, brother," I say.

As Tuyết and I stand there, holding each other in the quiet dawn, she untangles her checkered black and white scarf from around her neck and drapes it over mine. The fabric feels soft against my skin, carrying the warmth of her body. She smiles up at me.

"If anyone asks," she starts, tying the scarf into a knot. Her smile widens playfully. "You can tell them you took it off an elusive Viet Cong sniper you killed with your bare hands."

I laugh, the sound more heartbroken than I intended.

Feeling the need to reciprocate, my hand instinctively goes to the unit badge sewn onto my uniform. With careful movements, I use my knife to cut the threads that bind the badge to the fabric, making sure not to tear the material.

Once the badge is free, I hold it out to Tuyet. "And you can tell everyone you shot an elite Ranger at 1,000 meters."

Tuyết stares at the badge in her hands, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. I step closer, wrapping my arms around her in a tight embrace.

"I'll find you," I whisper into her ear, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. "When this godforsaken war is over, I'll come back for you."

She pulls back slightly, looking up at me as if to gauge my sincerity. With a shaky breath, she manages a smile.

"Don't keep me waiting too long," she says, her voice strong despite the tears that finally spill over.

I lean in, pressing my lips to hers in a kiss that feels like both a beginning and an end. Time seems to stand still at that moment. The intensity of our emotions makes it feel like an eternity, yet when we finally part, it feels as though no time has passed at all, leaving us yearning for more.

The sound of distant artillery, a grim reminder of the reality we're forced to return to, breaks the spell. With one last look at Tuyet, I turn to join Lâm and Hùng, each step away from her heavier than the last.

Leaving Tuyết and the village behind, we navigate the dense jungle, heading south towards our headquarters. The terrain is unforgiving, a tangled maze of vegetation that seems intent on impeding our progress.

Several hours into our journey, the dense jungle gives way to a narrow clearing. The sound of running water reaches our ears, a signal that we're close to one of the many rivers that criss-cross this region. Cautiously, we approach the riverbank.

As we scout the area for enemy activity, the distant hum of a boat engine catches our attention. With weapons raised and hearts racing, we prepare for whatever comes around the river bend.

Hiding among the foliage, we watch as a patrol boat rounds a bend in the river, its camouflage paint blending with the surroundings.

To our relief and surprise, we see the hull painted with the familiar colors and insignia of the South Vietnamese Navy.

As the boat slows, approaching cautiously, we signal to the crew, identifying ourselves as friendly. The sailors aboard the patrol boat are initially wary.

After a brief but tense exchange of identification and purpose, their wariness turns to welcome. We're pulled aboard the vessel with efficient, helping hands.
