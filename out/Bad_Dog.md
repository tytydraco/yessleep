   Sometimes myths are real, gruesomely so.  This man is Stevo Madima.  He became a werewolf.  A few misconceptions need to be understood before this tale is told.  Werewolves are very much like us.  They do not forget, nor regret the actions they take.  Stevo lived in a township next to a bog or swamp if you will. It is famous for all the wrong reasons.  Decapitated heads were often found here.  No reason or rhyme could uncover the reason nor the bodies of their victims.  The brutality of these murders had no clues left behind, and baffled many a detective, no fingerprints, no bodies, just the rotting heads foul bobbing in the stagnant water.  No one would consider a supernatural answer, though it was there, right before their eyes.

  Werewolves by night looked very much like a township dog, except a little larger than others of their type but can turn into something even darker… stronger. 

A man who was a werewolf became such by a curse from a witch doctor or the towns medicine man.  They say that lightning never strikes the same place twice, yet the Sangoma’s magic could make it so.  I knew of such a man who was struck by lightning twice, and survived, Madima had offended such a one of these by laughing at their power.  He found himself under a curse no man could dream of.  It was a nightmare every day and night.  He did not have the benefit of lightning striking him down.  No, he was transformed in a way that would change his life forever.   Madima had already a stunted arm that ended ant his elbow.  He got that from a falling wooden beam whilst working a construction job.  This was already a blow to him, as work became far from difficult, and blamed the witch doctor for his unfortunate fate too. 

  He became a car guard by day, and the days were long.  Cash was short due to the unions.  He built a shack close to the mountain where nobody would bother him except the falling rain that drenched the inside of his cabin from time to time.  His days were filled with the life of busy shoppers, cleaning the gum from under his cheap shoes.

  But that was where the Sangoma’s cursed really came into effect.  Between dusk and dawn, he became a dog, not just a dog, but a large scruffy looking animal that was pitied little and he had to steal scraps from dustbins and trash heaps.  All whilst limping from a broken right paw. 

He had to drop off his job as a car guard, for heaven’s sake, what if he turned one early morning or late evening.  What could he do?

  Now not all the myths about werewolves were not true.  Silver bullets hurt as much as real bullets.  They do not wake up naked unaware of what they have done.  They had time to prepare as Werewolves do not only change at the full moon, though the transformation is quicker and less controllable then.  It was a dog’s life.  Beaten and chased away from behind stores and had children throwing rocks at him.  The curse was real.  Real hard on him.  He had the ability to heal quickly, yet his front right paw remained constantly aching and caused him to limp through the township streets.      

  A person could still transform into this kind of beast through a bite, but that thought never bothered him as he had no intention of biting anyone, he did not want this curse on anyone.  It was a horrible experience.  It was by some good fortune at least for someone other than himself that this was when night had fallen and he could slink in the shadows. As a dog he had no name, no human nor any other creature noticed him.  And that was just fine.

  It was a full moon, where he discovered something new about himself, a blessing or misfortune that made up for his day drinking that was soon to bring his day job to an end.

  It began when he found a young woman being taken and in the process of sexual assault, like some kind of game between three youths, possibly ending in her of her death.

“Joey, she’s mine first”

Leo tore her from him, “Me first, then you, then the boy cuts and kills her after some fun”

“Guys, I’m no cool with this, let’s just leave her be and get out of here” the youth said

“And just how can we do that, she seen our faces and heard our names, we’d be done for by the cops, might as well have some fun along the way, and our freedom too” Leo laughed.

“What the hell is that?” Joey pointed at the shore.  Theres some small dog standing on his back paws.  It’s kind of cute and funny looking.”

 *“It had been a painful experience spring experience turning into the into the shape of a smaller creature.  But this was exhilarating, growing larger, 9 foot tall, my broken unfixed arm had become a sharp bone scimitar*.”

 His teeth proceeded from his mouth, and he drooled at what may be a better meal than he had ever had.

“What the…” and before they could get their words out:

  He leapt upon the men like lightning, separating their necks with his scimitar arm, removing their heads with the precision and instinct of a tiger, each man’s head falling into the water like lanterns into the bog, unlit and dead.  The girl, screamed.

“Monster, monster!” she screamed breaking free and stumbling with a voice cracking from her tired choked vocal cords. 

*“I couldn’t blame her, and I felt right for saving her. Even though she had to see that butchery, but the alternative was far worse.*

  *I didn’t kill the kid, but threw him down, my face right against him, remember: no biting!  The kid was scared and would tell people, anyway, thus securing his fate as well as making him seem crazy ought to be enough to lock him up.  I let him up and whispered in his ear: RUN!”*

And he did.

*“Here I was, a monster, saving the life of a girl more afraid of me, than of those who would have done terrible things to her. I dragged those bodies up this hill near my shack and buried most parts of them, then started a fire, dismantling what once was an evil man, dismembering him with my teeth, claws and scimitar.  I searched their pockets and they were filled with cash.  I guess that solves my money issues.* 

*I ambled down to a chicken coup up the valley, sliced through the wire with my wire cutting scimitar.  I grabbed three eggs with my somewhat normal talon of a hand, paw? I returned home.  After burying the remains. I left one leg out.*

 *I started a fire at dawn.  I cut off their feet and placed a leg on the fire.  It crackled and cooked like a leg of pork. The rest I buried with the others.  Now I knew what a werewolf really was.  A pro, I let a little out. Now I was protector of the weak and devourer of evil, now just a man with the taste of death on my breath”.*

*From here on I continued my just cause, the murder of many for the safety of one.  An eater of evil in the night.* 

  *And my legend grew. An evil beast that would take you to your death if you wandered those bogs at night, and although this was not my intention, it felt good to be feared.* 

*Heads kept showing up in the swampy water, but no clue as to where the bodies were.  The police were sent out to investigate, but came up with nothing, they visited every house and shack, including mine. But found nothing.* 

*The town folk were even skeptical of such rumors; Rumors arose of a gang that decapitated other gang members heads as a message covered my tracks quite easily and provided more prey.*     *These rumors were repaid in kind by other gangs imitating the same formula, and my tracks were thus easily covered.  I guess the evil of man is greater than that of the beast.*

  *But the real horror of my story comes by the corruption of unknowing innocence*. 

  *A young, fatherless I assumed, skin and bone boy, caught the odour of my meal, the crackling skin like that of a spitfire piece of pork came to me begging for food.  What could I do? Turn him away”.* 

“*I gave him the eggs, but he complained*,” Why’re you hogging all the bacon?”

*“Trust me child (*for a moment there was a dark glimmer his eyes*)* *Eat the at eggs, you don’t want this bacon. And don’t ask why, or I might tell you, and you don’t want that.*

  *We ate in silence.  The boy was full, he never questioned where the food came from, He thanked me for my kindness to him.  Perhaps I’ll tell him some day, perhaps I won’t, just pray I never see him at the bog accosting someone, thus from scimitar to supper my power was laid to rest. And I was content with my curse, by being the monster. I had learned two things about what I was, I had lost my conscience but regained my sympathy however horrible that may be.*

*Bad dog!*

*I can live with that”*
