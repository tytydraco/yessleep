I work, or rather, used to work, as a satellite engineer in upstate New York. My job was to listen to the stars. Most people picture satellite engineers as eggheads crunching numbers in sterile labs, but my work is more… intimate. I sat in a control room full of softly humming equipment, scanning the sky, monitoring signals from satellites, and occasionally listening for things that shouldn't be there.

It was during one of those quiet shifts that I heard it.

The night started off normal. I was alone in the monitoring station, halfway through my shift, sipping burnt coffee while flipping through static-filled audio channels. My job that evening was routine: confirm telemetry signals from a low-orbit satellite and ensure no interference from nearby communications. The air conditioning buzzed faintly above me, and the hum of my console was almost comforting.

But then something unusual caught my attention. My second monitor, set to stream live AM frequencies, had picked up the Coast to Coast AM broadcast. It was a tradition among night workers to leave Art Bell’s show playing in the background—his late-night topics about the paranormal, UFOs, and conspiracy theories were like a dose of caffeine for the imagination. That night, the subject was the infamous Area 51.

“Let’s go to the wildcard line,” Art’s voice came through. “You’re on the air.”

What followed chilled me.

“I—I don’t have a lot of time...” The caller’s voice was frantic, cracking with fear. “They’ll triangulate on this position quickly.”

I paused my work and turned up the volume. Art kept his cool. “What are you talking about, sir? You’re on a secure line.”

The man’s voice quivered, his words tumbling over each other. “I used to work at Area 51. I—I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago... I’ve been running ever since.”

I leaned closer to the monitor, my coffee forgotten. There was something terrifyingly genuine in his voice. It wasn’t the usual rambling of a conspiracy nut. This man was scared.

“What were you doing at Area 51?” Art asked. “And why are you running?”

“They’re gonna—” the man choked on his words. “They’ll catch me. They’ve been monitoring all the calls, and they’ll shut this down.”

Art tried to calm him down. “Slow down. What are they after you for?”

The caller hesitated, then his words tumbled out in a rush. “They’re not what you think. The stuff we’re dealing with at Area 51—it’s not extraterrestrial. They’re extradimensional! They’re not from space... they’re from other places, other dimensions. And they’re infiltrating... everywhere.”

The line crackled with static. For a moment, I thought we’d lost the signal, but the caller came back, his voice growing more desperate.

“They feed on chaos. That’s why they let us see the UFOs—it’s to keep us looking in the wrong direction. They don’t want us to know what they’re really doing! They’re preparing Earth for colonization—terraforming it to suit them!”

I gripped the edge of my desk, feeling an irrational fear clawing its way into my chest. Art’s voice broke through the tension. “Sir, you’re making some very big claims. Is there any proof you can share with us?”

Before the caller could respond, the signal just dropped. There was nothing. My monitor’s display flickered, and the stream froze. When it resumed, Art was speaking again, but the frantic caller was gone.

“Well, uh, we seem to have lost that line,” Art said, his usual composed demeanor slightly shaken. “That was… strange.”

I rewound the broadcast on my monitor and captured the audio. Something about the distortion in the interference felt deliberate. I ran the recording through an analyzer, isolating the cut off from the call. My heart sank when I realized it wasn’t random noise. It was a signal.

The signal contained coordinates—deep in the Nevada desert, not far from Area 51.

I didn’t know what to make of it. Part of me wanted to dismiss it as a prank, but my gut told me otherwise. I’ve spent years listening to signals from space, analyzing every anomaly, and this wasn’t something you’d stumble upon by accident. Someone—or something—wanted to stop that man from talking.

Later that night, I tried to call into Coast to Coast AM to ask Art if he’d heard anything else from the caller, but I couldn’t get through. The line kept disconnecting, and eventually, I gave up. I went home, exhausted but unable to sleep. That’s when things started to get strange.

The next morning, I found my work access restricted. My keycard wouldn’t open the doors at the station, and my login credentials had been revoked. When I called my supervisor, he acted like he didn’t know me. It didn’t make sense. I’d worked there for years.

Then the SUV showed up.

It was parked across the street from my apartment, engine idling. At first, I thought it was a coincidence, but it kept returning. Different times, same vehicle. Blacked-out windows. No plates.

That night, I woke up to static. My clock radio was blaring white noise at full volume. I stumbled out of bed to turn it off, but then I heard the voice—his voice—cutting through the static.

“They know you heard it. They know you’re listening. Stop.”

The radio went dead.

I didn’t sleep after that. I packed a bag, left my apartment, and started driving. I didn’t know where I was going, just that I couldn’t stay. I’ve been off the grid ever since, hiding in a cabin in the Rockies. No internet. No phone.

Sometimes, late at night, I turn on the shortwave radio I keep for emergencies. And sometimes, buried in the static, I hear the voice again.

“They’re coming. And you can’t run forever.”
