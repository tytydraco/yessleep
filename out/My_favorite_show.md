I'll start this off by telling you that I'm never in one place very long. I'm always moving around, so I can't really call anywhere home. But every new place I end up I always entertain myself by watching a different show. Most of these shows are just about families and their daily lives. But every once in a while I'll watch one that is just about a single character or two. 

The newest show I watched was another that was just about an normal family. The characters being the dad, mom, son (who looked to be in maybe the third grade), and a baby boy. I don't know any of the characters names because I never watched long enough to learn any of them. The first episode I watched began with the family eating breakfast in the morning before moving on with their days. All of them (except for the baby) eating eggs, toast, and sausage. All of them seemingly enjoying the food. Except for the baby, who had grabbed a fist full of baby food and thrown it across the table. This made me laugh aloud. The characters however, were now silent. Which I thought was weird because I could still hear the ambience of the show, such as a faint car horn, which told me it was still playing.

 I didn't see what happened next or why they had stopped talking, as I had stopped watching for a moment. But my attention was drawn back to the show once the dialogue of the characters resumed not long after the silence.They all finished their breakfast and had cleaned the mess left by the baby. The mom headed up the stairs carrying the baby in her arms while the son ran out to the car with his school bag, followed by the dad who had just grabbed the car keys from the kitchen counter.In the background you could hear the sound of both doors of the car shutting and the car starting and leaving the driveway.

 There was a small break which allowed me to get more comfortable and in a better position for the upcoming scene. The scene began with the mother already leaving the room of the baby after cradling him to sleep and placing him in his crib. Next a long scene played out consisting of the baby laying in its crib sleeping. After I was bored of watching the seemingly infinite scene I decided I would go find something to eat and watch the rest later. After eating i returned to my show which was currently showing the mother doing laundry, specifically transferring clothes from the washer to the dryer and then placing a new load in the washer. It wasn't a very long or entertaining scene but I just kept watching. She then finished and began walking towards the living room. As seen from a different angle from behind the couch she was now sat on, she began searching the the TV channels for a decent show, she ended up settling on some beauty show I didn't know the name of. I though this was weird, just a scene of a show inside a show?

 I took a break from watching and looked for something else to do. I decided I was going to draw each of the characters so I managed to find some paper and something to draw with. I began with the mom as that was the character freshest in my mind. Once I finished her I moved onto the baby, then the son, and finally the father. I set the complete drawing down and only watched one more scene which was of the son attempting to sleep late at night. The second episode began the same with breakfast, this time they were now eating pancakes and bacon, all except for the baby. The boy began saying that he heard something outside his window the previous night.

 The parents assured him that he probably heard a raccoon or a cat or maybe even a dog. They weren't sure what to say when he told them that he had then seen a person standing outside his window staring at him. And that he had a tough time sleeping after they had left. They ended up telling him it was probably just his mind playing tricks on him, as mind's do in the dark. They all seemed to shrug it off and continued with breakfast before the mother and son left to go to the store. Which is where the next scene played out. As they entered the store the boy let go of his mother's hand and bolted towards the toy aisle which was empty until now. He walked back and forth down the aisle amazed by all the toys. He ended up picking up a large lego set and inspecting the box, tracing his finger along the words describing what was inside. As he was reading, something caught his eye and he looked directly into the shot of the scene with a worried expression before it abruptly ended. 

It continued from a far shot when suddenly the mother appeared and scolded the boy for running off and giving her, "quite the scare." After finishing the shopping and loading the groceries into the car they returned home. Once home the boy ran to the back yard to play. After which the parents began to talk but walked into a different room out of the angle of the shot where their conversation could no longer be heard. This scene played out for a while until the boy returned holding a piece of paper. He sat down, his back facing the shot and held up the paper.It was my drawing of the characters. I was shocked, I didn't know how this was possible. How was he holding my drawing? I couldn't wrap my head around it, I had lost the drawing sure but how was it in the show? The parents then entered the room and seen the drawing, they both studied it before applauding the boys skills and asking him if he had drawn it. They both looked confused when he simply replied with, "no."

 I couldn't watch anymore and ran off to bed, barely able to catch any sleep as I was still trying to wrap my head around what had just happened. The next morning I began watching the third episode. The scene began again with breakfast, the family had settled with waffles this time. But none of them spoke, until the boy again said that he had seen the same figure standing outside his window again last night. The parents only replied with worried expressions.

 The mother said to the father that she had seen someone who appeared to be stalking her and the boy at the store the day before. The father stated that he wasn't sure just what to do yet and that they should wait and see if anything else happens before calling the police. They then resumed their normal routines, with the boy and father leaving in the car and the mother and baby heading upstairs. I didn't watch the show until later in the same episode when the boy returned and again walked out the back door towards the yard to play. This time he stopped on the porch, not daring to step into the yard. He was looking directly into the shot again. He let out a horrified scream but still couldn't seem to move. This usually doesn't happen this early. 

The father came running out the back door leaving it open before he too looked into the shot horrified. He told the boy to get his mother and tell her to call the police. The boy quickly disappeared inside crying. The father still staring into the shot. The mother returned soon after holding the baby looking confused, the boy hiding behind her, still scared. She asked the father what was going on before she too looked into the shot. The same expression appearing on her face as the other twos. The father then said just barely loud enough to hear, "call the police and tell them there is a man sitting in the bushes staring at us."Welp time to move again. I wonder what show I'll watch at my next place... It's a shame though, that would've been my favorite show.
