A voice.

Behind me.

A real voice.

The training video flickers on-screen, still playing, but the moment I look away—it stops making sense. The words keep coming, but the meaning slips through my mind like water. The cheery host is still talking, but I can’t grasp the sentences. Like I’m hearing words for the first time without knowing what they mean. Like my brain can’t hold onto them unless I’m looking.

I turn my head just slightly— The distortion gets worse. The music rises, twisting, bubbling into something that almost sounds like speech. The voices are layered. Talking over each other. Some high, some low, all buried beneath static. I glance back at the screen— For a split second, the smiling host is looking at me.

Not at the audience. At me. Then it snaps back. The voice behind me is closer now. Low. Urgent. 

"Don’t look at them. Get up. Now."

I swallow hard, my pulse hammering in my throat. I chance another glance at Liam. He’s still sitting there. Still staring at the screen. But his mouth just moved. And the video host didn’t say anything.

“Liam?”

My chest tightens.

The voice comes again, sharper. “Korynn—move.”

Liam’s fingers dig into my wrist, yanking me back just as my gaze starts to flick toward the screen. I stumble, breath hitching, my pulse hammering against my ribs. The training video keeps playing, its upbeat music a sickly contrast to the tension in my chest. I want to look. Not because I want to watch—but because it wants me to.

It’s a pull, a slow and heavy weight in my skull, like my mind is being dragged under deep water. Liam shakes me. 

"Korynn—move."

I focus on him. His face. His too-wide eyes. The slight tremor in his hands. He’s afraid, but not the way I am. He’s been here longer. Days. He should’ve turned by now. Why hasn’t he?

The video glitches. The audio shifts, distorting, stretching, bubbling into something almost like—

"New trainees must comply."

My stomach lurches.

"All Employees must follow store policy."

Liam’s grip tightens. 

"We have to go. Now."

My legs refuse to move.

"Liam—"

The screen flickers again. The words change. Just for a second. But I see them. Something shifts in the room. A shadow moves. The Manager is looking at me. Liam pulls me forward. I don’t resist this time. We move. Fast. Quiet. Away from the screen. Away from the frozen trainees. Away from the thing standing at the edge of the room.

The door in front of us has no handles. No knobs. No keypads. Just a solid, featureless surface. It is not a door, it’s not an exit. Liam doesn’t care.He presses his hands to the frame and pushes. My pulse pounds. 

"That’s not going to—"

Something clicks. The door shudders. A low mechanical hiss bleeds through the silence, like the air is being sucked out of the room. Liam shoves harder, and then—it gives. A narrow gap. A sliver of cold, stagnant air from the other side. The hallway beyond is dark. Wrong. Liam doesn’t hesitate. He slides through, pulling me behind him. The door seals shut behind us.

“They don’t follow past this door.”

I blink, still catching my breath. The words take a second to sink in.

“…What?”

“The Employees.” His voice is hoarse. “They don’t come in here.”

I glance back at the door. Featureless. Seamless. It looks like it was never meant to open.

The rest of the Store felt alive. A shifting maze, watching, waiting. This place? Dead. Stagnant.

I don’t trust it.

“How do you know?”

Liam laughs dryly. It’s not humor. It’s exhaustion.

“Because I’ve been here for three days.”

The words sink in slow. Three days. I stare at him, my skin crawling. Liam shouldn’t be here. He should have turned. He should have been one of them. I don’t realize I’ve spoken out loud until I hear my own voice:

“Three days? What—why didn’t you turn?”

Liam rubs his arms. I can’t tell if he’s cold or just trying to shake something off.

“I don’t know.”

I don’t like that answer.

“I think I figured out the video.”

“Every few days, they fill that room.” His voice is low, almost cautious.

“New people. Always new people. Always teenagers. They sit in perfect rows. They don’t talk. They don’t blink. They just… watch.”

I feel sick.

Liam glances at me, hesitant. “The video does something to them.”

“What?” My voice is barely a whisper.

“If you watch, you turn.” He swallows hard. “But only if you focus. You have to look. You have to listen.”

I feel my stomach lurch. I think about how the words only made sense when I was watching. The moment I looked away, they started slipping through my mind, losing meaning. I almost ask how he got away. But before I can, he speaks first. I watch him carefully. He rubs his arms again and avoids my gaze.

“Maybe they don’t see me the same way. Maybe something went wrong. Or maybe I just—got out before it worked.”

I want to ask more. Why don’t they see him? Why isn’t he one of them? But he keeps talking,

“I was there for one of the training videos, when I heard them talking—well. Not them.” 

His voice wavers.

 “The intercom. It was calling out names.”

I inhale sharply.

“Names?”

Liam nods. His jaw is tight.

“They don’t fight it.”

 His voice is almost too quiet to hear.

 “They just… listen. And after the video, they stand up and leave. Like they’ve always worked here.”

I stare at him, unable to speak. Like Employees. Like they were never anything else. Like they didn’t exist before the Store. I swallow hard.

“You watched them change?”

Liam looks away.

“…Yeah.”

He lets out a sharp breath, dragging his hands through his hair.

“I didn’t think I could do anything. But then I saw you. And I figured—”

His voice cracks. He stops, clears his throat, and tries again.

“…Maybe I could help.”

I don’t know what to say to that. For a moment, neither of us speak. We just sit there, in the cold glow of the flickering fluorescents, surrounded by forgotten inventory. The Employee Lounge is behind us. But we’re still trapped in the Store. And we still have no way out.

Liam exhales, running a hand through his hair. I think he expects me to say something. Maybe to thank him for pulling me out. Maybe to reassure him that what he did was enough. But all I can do is sit there.

For a moment, the only sound is the hum of the flickering fluorescents overhead. The air feels too still. Too quiet.  I think about Liam, alone in this place for days. Watching kids come and go. Watching them change. And I think about how close I was to joining them. I press my hands against my face, forcing a slow breath.

My gaze drifts down, absently tracing the dust on the floor—until I see it. A scrap of thermal receipt paper. It’s been here for a while. The ink is faded, the edges curled slightly from exposure. But the numbers printed on it are still clear.

70 69 6e 6e 61 63 6c 65 68 61 72 64 77 61 72 65 2e 73 71 75 61 72 65 73 70 61 63 65 2e 63 6f 6d

I frown.

"Hey, Liam?" I hold up the slip of paper. "Do you know what this is?"

He leans over, squinting at the numbers. "Looks like a code."

"Yeah, but for what?"

He shakes his head. "No clue."

We stare at it for a long moment. I don’t know what it means. Neither of us do. But maybe someone else will. If anyone sees this—if anyone has read anything from me in the last few days—please help. We don’t know what to do next. We’re going to look for a way out. I’ll update when I can.
