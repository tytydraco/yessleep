I was spending the night in a hotel in Oklahoma City, home of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team, that is known for having ghosts that have terrorized NBA players on opposing teams. The hotel was built in the early 1900s and said to be haunted by the ghost of a maid called Effie. Legend says that Effie had an illicit relationship with the hotel’s founder, WB Skirvin. When it was discovered that she was with child, he locked her in a room on the top floor. Distraught, Effie plummeted from the hotel room window to the street below.

The hotel has an interesting history, all in all, having been known as a speakeasy during prohibition. It has also been the host of many famous and interesting faces through the decades. It was closed for over a decade, fell into disrepair, only to become an urban exploring hotspot before it was completely renovated and then reopened.

Guests have reported hearing unexplained noises, seeing objects moving unexpectedly, and even being touched by something (or someone) unseen.

As for me and my experience, I had a lovely evening including dinner at the hotel restaurant and an after-dinner drink in the piano bar. We went back to the room, settled in, and fell fast asleep with no problems. At some point in the night, I had a dream that someone was in the room, moving around. It was just this dark shadow, slowly going across the room. In my dream, I just watched it move. Then I woke up.

When I awoke, the room was dark, but there was also a dark figure of a person literally standing beside the bed, right next to me. It was clearly a human form just standing there. I thought maybe I was still dreaming, at first, but I was too conscious, you know? It wasn’t like being in a dream state.

I reached out to see if anything was actually there. I grabbed onto what looked like this thing’s left arm and pulled on it. This thing fell onto the bed, right across my upper legs. I could literally feel the weight of this figure on me. I start to yell out and bolt upright in bed, trying to push this thing off of me. My SO wakes up in a panic, wondering what’s wrong, and the thing is gone.

I almost (maybe) would have chalked it up as sleep paralysis, which I have never experienced, but… aside from the hotel’s haunted history and other guests’ experiences… my SO said he was hearing noises through the night as though someone was moving through the room. 

Maybe it was Effie? Maybe it was someone or something else… but I wasn’t able to fall asleep again that night until the sun started to rise and those little bits of light started coming in through the closed curtains. I haven't been back, but I'm not against another stay in this haunted historic hotel in the middle of the United States.
