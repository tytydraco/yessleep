About a year ago moved out of my parent's house and moved into my own place a bit further down in the same village. I was there for about 5-6 months. 

The first couple of weeks there were perfectly normal, I was settling in quite nicely. Then one Tuesday night I woke up in the middle of the night because of some buzzing sounds. I went downstairs to find quite a large amount of flies buzzing around the house. I found this really odd and was wondering where they came from but I did have a window slightly open so thought nothing of it really for the rest of the week. However, the following Tuesday, the same thing happened again, must've been around 2-3am both times. I was pretty creeped out at this point so decided to check to make sure everything was closed and locked and there was no way for flies to enter. I didn't sleep very well for the next week as I was anticipating the same thing to potentially happen the next Tuesday. At times I thought I was paranoid but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

The next Tuesday came about and I decided to stay up and sit in the front room all night. I didn't hear anything out of the ordinary for the hours I was up, until out of nowhere I hear the letterbox open on the front door and a swarm of flies get released into the house! I pushed my way through the swarm and threw open the front door only to see the back of a dark figure fleeing down the street and round the corner out of sight. I tried to chase after them but when I reached the corner I must've been too late and they were nowhere to be seen. All I felt I could do at this point was retreat back to my house and rid the house of the remaining flies. I sat the rest of the night wondering what was going on and why this person was targeting ME to do such a thing to every Tuesday night (Wednesday morning I suppose technically). 

The next morning I decided to phone the police to let them know about the person and what they were doing, I seemed to get a kind of response which felt like nothing would really come from reporting such a strange thing. Maybe they thought it was a joke? Either way I was pretty terrified now. 

Yet again the next Tuesday came along and again I waited, this time closer to the door and ready to catch them in the act. I waited all night, but as long as I waited, they never came. I was partly relieved in a way and thought that maybe it was just some prankster who had got bored and given up. OH HOW WRONG I WAS! The very next night I was in bed, feeling a little more at ease, when I heard the loud buzz of flies launch their way through the letterbox again! Just as I heard it, I decided this time to jump out of bed and go straight to my upstairs front window to try and get a better look of the culprit this time. My mouth went dry at what I saw running from my property. It was what I could only describe as a human dressed up as a fly; full head fly mask, black cloak and small wings resembling those of a fly. They were clutching a box of some kind that I didn't get a proper look at and ran round the corner out of sight. 

I stood there for a few seconds just staring in fright before eventually going down to clear the flies. 

Following this incident, I tried everything to catch the Fly Guy. I waited up at night. I had friends round and took turns with them. But it never showed up whenever I was prepared. It continued to show up whenever I was off guard and wouldn't be able to catch it in time. It was like it knew what I was doing at all times and knew when to and when not to strike based on how prepared I was. I scanned the house for cameras several times but didn't find anything.

I went to the police again, they didn't take me seriously and laughed and thought I was taking the piss.

Eventually, I simply had to move out of the new house back to my parents and it hasn't happened to me at all at my parent's house since I did.

So I never managed to catch the Fly Guy. He's still out there somewhere.
