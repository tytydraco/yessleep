I was nine years old the first time I met him.

They always tell you sleep paralysis demons are supposed to be terrifying, the kind of shadowy figures that loom over your bed, whispering your name until the breath is snatched from your throat. They’re supposed to leave you frozen, eyes wide open but unable to scream. They say these demons feed on your fear, growing stronger with every ounce of terror they can wring from your soul.

But the night he first appeared, I wasn’t scared. I was too numb to be scared.

That night, the house was too quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like something is waiting for you to close your eyes, to let your guard down. My foster father, Gary, had been in one of his moods, and my body still ached from the last time he’d lost his temper. I tried to stay as still as possible, barely breathing, praying he’d stay in his chair downstairs and leave me alone.

I remember lying in that ratty bed, staring up at the cracked ceiling, trying to keep my mind blank. I counted the spiderwebs in the corners of the room, anything to distract myself from the throbbing pain and the creeping dread that he might come back up the stairs. Every creak of the floorboards sent a jolt of terror through me, but I didn’t move. I didn’t dare.

Then I felt it—the suffocating weight pressing down on my chest, like a heavy blanket I couldn’t shake off. My arms, my legs, even my fingers were pinned in place by some unseen force. Panic welled up inside me, but I couldn’t cry out, couldn’t even twitch. All I could do was lie there, helpless, as the darkness in the room began to shift.

A shadow detached itself from the corner of the room, slithering along the walls like a living thing. It moved with an unnatural fluidity, stretching and warping until it towered over my bed. The shape of it was wrong—elongated limbs that scraped the ceiling, a face that was little more than a jagged maw full of needle-like teeth, eyes that burned like hot coals in a skull that seemed to float just above its shoulders.

The air in the room turned frigid as the creature loomed over me, its breath rattling like the death rattle of some ancient, forgotten beast. It reached out with a hand that was more claw than flesh, and the stench of decay hit me like a physical blow. The demon’s skin was black and cracked, like charred wood, and when it opened its mouth, I could see rows of teeth that looked sharp enough to slice through bone.

A deep, guttural voice rumbled from its throat, so low I could feel it vibrating through my bones. “You’re mine now, little one.”

Its words seeped into my mind like a toxic fog, twisting around my thoughts until I couldn’t tell where my terror ended and its presence began. But as I stared into those hellish eyes, the fear I expected never came. My heart was already broken, my soul already bruised, and this thing—this demon—was nothing compared to the nightmare that waited for me every day in the waking world.

The demon paused, its twisted grin faltering as it stared down at me. “Aren’t you… scared?” it hissed, the sound grating like metal scraping against stone.

I wanted to laugh, but I couldn’t move. My throat was locked tight, my voice nothing more than a ghost in my mind. Somehow, I managed to whisper, “No.”

It recoiled slightly, as if my words had struck it, the red glow in its eyes flickering like dying embers. For a moment, I thought I saw something like confusion—or maybe disappointment—on its shadowed face. But then it leaned closer, the weight of its presence pressing down on me like a physical force. I could feel its breath on my face, colder than the grave, smelling of rot and old blood.

“Why not?” it rasped, its voice carrying the weight of ancient, unspeakable horrors.

I wanted to tell it about Gary, about how he’d made my life a waking nightmare. I wanted to tell it that after enduring his wrath, nothing it could do would ever come close. But I couldn’t find the words, so I just stared up at it, my eyes wide and unblinking, hoping it would understand.

The demon’s grin twisted into something almost… curious. “You’re a strange one, aren’t you?” it muttered, more to itself than to me. It straightened up, looming over me like a dark god, its shadow swallowing the room in an abyssal blackness. “Perhaps you’ll be more fun than the others…”

It reached out again, its clawed hand resting on my shoulder, the weight of it sending a jolt of cold through my entire body. The demon’s touch was like ice, burning through my skin and into my bones, but I didn’t flinch. I couldn’t. I was paralyzed, trapped in that space between waking and dreaming where nightmares are born. But even as I lay there, helpless, a strange sense of comfort washed over me.

“You and I… we’re going to be great friends,” the demon whispered, its voice like the rustle of dead leaves in the wind. “I’ll keep you company. I’ll keep you safe.”

And that’s exactly what it did.
For weeks, the demon would visit me in the dead of night, slipping into my room like a shadow come to life. Sometimes, it would simply sit at the foot of my bed, its eyes glowing like twin embers in the darkness, watching me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.

But there was a strange comfort in its presence. A twisted, perverse sense of safety that came from knowing the demon was there, watching over me, keeping the real monsters at bay.
Then came the night when Gary stumbled into my room, reeking of whiskey, his face twisted with rage. I could hear the floorboards creak under his weight, feel the oppressive heat of his breath on my face as he leaned over me, his voice slurred and ugly as he muttered something I couldn’t understand.

I was frozen, the paralysis holding me tighter than ever, my heart pounding in my chest as the familiar terror surged through me. But this time, I wasn’t alone.

The demon was there, standing in the corner of the room, its eyes burning like twin fires in the darkness. It watched Gary with a predatory hunger, its twisted grin spreading wider and wider until it seemed to split its face in two. I could see the malice in its eyes, feel the fury radiating off it in waves.
And then it moved.

The demon was on Gary in an instant, its long, clawed hands wrapping around his throat with a speed and ferocity that took my breath away. Gary’s eyes went wide, his mouth opening in a silent scream as the demon lifted him off the ground, its claws sinking into his flesh like hot knives through butter.

Gary thrashed and struggled, his hands clawing at the demon’s arms, but it was no use. The demon’s grip was unyielding, its strength far beyond anything human. I watched, frozen in a mix of horror and fascination, as the demon’s face twisted into something truly monstrous—its mouth stretching impossibly wide, its teeth growing longer and sharper until they looked more like fangs.

Then, with a sickening crunch, the demon tightened its grip, and I heard the bones in Gary’s neck snap like dry twigs. His body went limp, his eyes rolling back in his head as the demon dropped him to the floor like a discarded toy.

The silence that followed was deafening. The only sound was the faint drip, drip, drip of blood pooling on the floor. The demon stood over Gary’s lifeless body, its chest heaving with each breath, its eyes glowing with an unholy light.

It turned to me, its grin fading into something more sinister, more calculating. “He won’t hurt you anymore,” it said, its voice dripping with dark satisfaction. “You’re safe now.”

But there was something in its eyes, something that made my blood run cold. It wasn’t satisfaction or relief—it was hunger. The demon had fed, and it wanted more.

After that night, the demon disappeared for a while. Social services came, and I was moved to another home, then another, and another. But I never forgot what had happened. I never forgot the way the demon had killed Gary, the way it had protected me, but also the way it had reveled in the kill.

As I grew older, the demon started to return. It would appear in the shadows of my room, watching me with those burning eyes, its twisted grin never far from its face. Sometimes it would speak, whispering dark things in my ear as I lay paralyzed in bed, its voice seeping into my mind like poison. Other times, it would simply watch, its presence a constant reminder that I was never truly alone.

When I turned 26, I found myself in another nightmare, one that was all too real. I’d fallen in love with a man who turned out to be just as monstrous as Gary. He was charming at first, showering me with affection, making me feel like I was the only person in the world who mattered. But it didn’t take long for the mask to slip, for the true nature of the man underneath to be revealed.

He was controlling, manipulative, and when he didn’t get his way, he was violent. I tried to leave him, but he always found a way to pull me back, to make me believe that I couldn’t live without him.

One night, after a particularly brutal argument, I packed my bags and decided I was done. I was leaving, and nothing he said or did was going to stop me. I waited until he was asleep, then crept down the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest as I reached for the door.

That’s when I saw him.
My demon, standing in the hallway, his eyes burning with a malevolent light. His grin was wider than ever, stretching across his face like a gash, his teeth glinting in the dim light. He shook his head slowly, his long claws flexing as he stepped closer.

“Don’t go,” he whispered, his voice a low growl that sent shivers down my spine. 
“He’s not done yet.”

I froze, my hand hovering over the doorknob, as I heard the creak of floorboards behind me. I turned just in time to see my boyfriend, a knife gleaming in his hand, his eyes wild with fury. He lunged at me, the blade flashing in the dim light, aiming for my throat.

But the demon was faster.
He moved like a shadow, slipping between us in an instant, his claws catching the blade in midair. My boyfriend’s eyes went wide with terror as the demon turned to him, its grin spreading impossibly wide, its teeth growing longer, sharper, until they looked like fangs.

“He’s all yours,” the demon hissed, its voice dripping with malice. “You know what to do.”

My hands were shaking as I reached for the knife, the cold metal biting into my skin. I could feel the demon’s presence behind me, his breath hot on the back of my neck as he whispered dark encouragements in my ear.
“Do it,” he urged, his voice a low, insistent growl. “Show him what you’re made of.”

I didn’t think. I just acted. I drove the knife into my boyfriend’s chest, the blade sinking in with a sickening crunch. His eyes went wide, his mouth opening in a silent scream as I twisted the blade, the demon’s laughter ringing in my ears.

When it was over, I collapsed to the floor, the knife slipping from my blood-soaked hands. The demon knelt beside me, his long arms wrapping around me in a tight embrace. I could feel his breath on my neck, warm and comforting, as he whispered in my ear.
“You did well,” he murmured, his voice soft and almost… tender. “You’ve finally learned to defend yourself.”

I looked up at him, tears streaming down my face, and for the first time, I saw something in his eyes that I hadn’t seen before—pride. But there was also something else, something that made my heart ache.
“I have to go now,” he said, his voice barely more than a whisper. “You don’t need me anymore.”

I shook my head, clutching at his arms, not wanting to let go. “Don’t leave,” I whispered, my voice cracking. “I’m not ready.”
He smiled, a sad, gentle smile that seemed out of place on his monstrous face. “Yes, you are,” he said, his voice full of quiet conviction. “You’re stronger than you know. You can take care of yourself now.”
He leaned down, pressing a cold, ghostly kiss to my forehead. 

“I’m so proud of you,” he whispered, his voice fading into the darkness. “You’ll be okay.”
And then he was gone.

I sat there in the darkness, the silence pressing down on me, the weight of what I’d just done slowly sinking in. But as the tears continued to fall, I felt a strange sense of peace, a calm that I hadn’t felt in years.

The demon was right. I was strong. Strong enough to face the monsters in the daylight, and strong enough to face whatever darkness came next
