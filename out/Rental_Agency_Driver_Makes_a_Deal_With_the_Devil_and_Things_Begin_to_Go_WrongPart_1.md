  
Luke sucks at soccer, there I said it. I know as a dad that is a terrible thing to say. But it is the truth.   
My eight year old son is much better at math than running about dribbling the ball on the soccer pitch. But he has the time of his life every time he steps on the field. His enthusiasm often rubs off on his teammates and, many times, even the coach.

  
Whether it is a practice session during the weekdays or a game on the weekends, Luke gives it his all, even if the end result is not to his liking. Today would be a good example of that. His team NY Trailblazers got their behinds razed in typical lawn mower fashion with a 0-7 drubbing. 

  
So, it has become customary for me to treat a sulking Luke to an ice cream at his favorite joint after every Sunday game, where he would go over the game specifics, in the hopes that a change of tactics would somehow lead to a change of outcome in the next. 

  
His attention however changed midway when he suddenly spotted a large limousine stop at a construction site nearby. 

  
“Dad, do you drive one of those?” he asked, looking at me. 

  
I wasn’t surprised at the question since I work as a driver for a car rental agency. But we no longer had those stretch limousines at our shop anymore. Its popularity had waned over the years, and a lot of travelling businessmen now find them tacky to use in the New York financial circles at least. 

  
“No buddy. But your grandpa did. In fact he used to pick me up from school in that car often, and we used to go on long drives.” I said. 

  
“I would like to travel in that too someday”, Luke replied back, his eyes still fixed on the car.   
“Well, maybe you can take your date to prom in that thing in a few years, hopefully you will learn to kiss a girl before that,” I said smiling, while Luke shrivelled his nose in mock disgust. 

  
The sight of the limousine brought about mixed feelings in me. My dad, Henry Pritchard, walked out of my life when I was 10 years old. I remember it vividly: one fine day, he approached me and announced that he was traveling abroad for work for a little while. He emphasized that I was to be the man of the house until his return, and he instructed me to take good care of Mom in his absence.

  
As I peered through the window sill from my room, I saw dad wave at me one last time before boarding a red colored stretch limousine outside our home. I never saw or heard from him again. 

  
My thoughts were suddenly interrupted when I felt my phone ring in my pocket, it was from my Boss Gary Mehicus.

  
“Hey Matt, we got a new booking today. Big fish by the looks of it. He’s booked us for the whole month. Insisted on you being the wheelman, said you came highly recommended. You think you can handle it for the entire time?” he asked me. 

  
 “Sure Boss. Just tell me when and where,” I responded. 

  
“Great. Take good care of him Matt. He might just tip you a sack of gold” Gary said laughing. ”Oh, and take Roy out for a spin” he added, before ending the call. 

  
Roy, a custom-ordered Rolls Royce Phantom, is our best car at the rental agency. He is reserved exclusively for our top clients. Gary and I visited the manufacturers and spent a couple of days meticulously selecting every detail for Roy, from Arctic white leather seats to discreet bullet-proofing, wood veneers to upholstery, and every other amenity to achieve the best blend of both luxury and security.

  
Gary and I go back a long way. In fact, he was best friends with my dad, and they both used to work for the same rental agency. Gary is also my godfather, and when my dad went missing, he went the extra mile to fill the void in my life. 

  
I developed a rebellious streak in my early teens, angry that dad had abandoned me and mom as a family. For the first few months after his disappearance, I made it a point to peek at the window every day, sometimes for hours, hoping he would eventually turn up—a habit that never stopped and still continues subconsciously to this day, although I know better now.

  
However, back then, it eventually turned to anger, and Mom had a difficult time controlling me as a kid. My grades started falling, I would pick fights with children in school, and I even tried my luck being an errand boy for drug peddlers in my neighbourhood. Gary had to intervene and introduced me to his love for baseball and driving. 

  
He took me on long drives once every month for an entire year and showed me around the countryside. It felt like a soothing balm for the wounded soul. 

  
But my happiest moment came when I was in attendance at the stadium with Gary, and Tino Martinez’s grand slam in '98 unfolded right in front of our eyes. We all went delirious with joy at the stadium, as I found myself hugging and celebrating with random strangers. That experience changed my life and I emerged transformed as a person. 

  
Gary also obtained a signed jersey and cap from the players during his time chauffeuring them on tours, presenting it to me as a birthday gift. It remains my most prized possession. 

  
So when he started his own rental agency, I decided to join his company as soon as I was finished with school and have been working for him ever since. 

  
My own childhood experiences motivated me to be the best dad I could be to my own kid. Since his mother was no longer with us, I always went the extra mile to ensure he had a supportive and loving environment. 

  
I tried to inculcate in Luke my love for driving and baseball, but the kid gravitated towards soccer. Fortunately, we still do share a common love for cars, and he always looks forward to long drives on weekends.

  
My mind got diverted again when I heard my phone beep, Gary had just sent me the details about the next client. I dropped Luke at home and went to the office garage to take Roy out for a spin.  
A couple of hours later, I arrived at the address I had received on my phone. Situated a little bit on the outskirts of the city, I got there half an hour ahead of time. 

  
I parked my car near a diner and noticed a large man standing by the entrance. Dressed in a perfectly tailored pinstripe suit, he appeared to be in his early fifties, around 6’4" in height, with broad shoulders and a heavy set build. 

  
His salt-and-pepper hair was slicked back, and his beard was neatly trimmed. He casually smoked a cigar while holding a walking stick in his other hand, adorned with a prominent goat-shaped carving at the top.

  
"Mr. Thomas Devlin?" I inquired as I stepped out of the car. He nodded, extending his hand while clenching the cigar in his mouth. 

  
"And you must be Matt?" he declared, with a booming baritone voice. I could see a couple of gold teeth glint in the dark as he flashed a warm smile. 

  
"Yes Sir. I'm Matt Prichard, your chauffeur for the evening. I hope I haven't kept you waiting?" I inquired, feeling a tinge of embarrassment, despite being ahead of schedule. 

  
“No young man. I usually like to stretch my legs and enjoy a cigar after a fine meal’” he said pointing to the diner behind him. Mr. Devlin looked a peculiar sight in this neighborhood, especially with the  diner in the backdrop.  

  
Everything about him screamed money, so it did make me wonder why someone of his affluence would choose to visit this place, at this hour. But I could also sense an undeniable toughness in him, the kind of man who probably started from the bottom and had to work his way up the ladder.  
A few minutes later, Mr. Devlin suggested we hit the road, and I promptly opened the car door, allowing him to ease into the backseat. 

  
When I took my position behind the wheel, he handed me a gold card, which was the size of a normal government ID but much thicker. 

  
It had a red Trident symbol embossed on both ends. As I looked at it confused, he told me to simply place it on the GPS screen. I did as I was told, and the navigation system immediately sprang to life, displaying a new set of coordinates.

  
Mr Devlin realized my lingering confusion as I continued to stare at the card that was stuck to the screen.

  
“Probably a hidden chip embedded in that thing,” he joked from the backseat, his teeth glinting as I looked in the rear view mirror. 

  
I quickly nodded in acknowledgment and began driving. 

  
As we navigated through the city, Mr. Devlin shared that he was based out of Chicago and was currently in the city for a new business venture. He was not much of a conversationalist but instead showed more interest in my life, inquiring about my job and family. 

  
It struck me as somewhat unusual for a businessman of his stature to delve into a chauffeur's experiences. He particularly relished the humorous stories I recounted revolving Luke, often breaking into a smile.

  
While chauffeurs typically have anecdotes on hand for bored clients, Mr. Devlin appeared genuinely intrigued by my life, almost as if he was using it as an opportunity to evaluate me.

  
The navigation system then finally beeped to signal the arrival of the location, and a newly opened grand hotel loomed just a few feet away.

  
“Sir your card,” I said, as I retrieved the gold card from the screen and turned around in my seat to hand it to him. 

  
Mr. Devlin said, “Keep it, Matt; it's your tip for the evening.”

  
“Don’t worry, it's genuine,” he chuckled as he noticed me glancing at the gold card a little longer than necessary. “And consider it a ticket, not a card,” he clarified. 

  
Mr. Devlin then fell silent for a moment, remaining seated in contemplation as he gazed in my direction before resuming to speak again. 

  
“Matt, I have a proposition for you? Would you be interested in hearing me out?” he suddenly asked me.

  
“Sure Mr Devlin, what do you have in mind?” I responded. 

  
“I am looking for a driver I can rely on. Your name came recommended from a former client of yours whose judgment I trust. I was told that you are good at your job, professional, always on time, know your way around the city, and that you are discreet about the clients you chauffeur. Would you accept that as an accurate assessment of yourself?” he asked. 

  
“Yes Sir. That would be correct” I replied back. 

  
“Good. So here is what I have in mind. I need you to chauffeur my clients for the next 30 days. The details of the pick-up will be texted to your phone every day at 7:00 PM sharp. All you have to do is pick them up and drop them at the coordinates provided to you. That is all. Nothing more. Similar to how it happened between us today. A gold ticket will be given to you at the start of each drop, and that would be your payment for services rendered." 

  
“I hope I have been clear thus far?” he stopped midway to ask me. I simply nodded back.

  
“Excellent. Now, I have 3 conditions you need to religiously adhere to. One, if you agree to take on this job, you cannot walk out midway. You need to see it through.”

  
“Two, under no circumstances are you to participate or involve yourself in whatever activity the passengers may be engaged in. Your job is to solely chauffeur them, and once you have dropped them at the designated location, you are to return back. There is no need for you to wait to pick them up again. “

  
“Three, you have to be discreet about this job, which means nobody else can know about it. That would include your boss or any other colleagues in your agency.”

  
“These are the only three rules you need to follow. Furthermore, payment to your company has already been settled in full for the proposed deal's duration, covering fuel costs and exclusively booking your services as a driver. So, you do not have to worry about other commitments either. I need you to concentrate only on the job at hand. Are we clear?” he asked, pausing again to await my response. 

  
I nodded in understanding, although I was beginning to get wary about what was on offer. The more the man spoke, the more I began to wonder if I would be getting into some kind of trouble.  
“Sir, I need to ask. Does this job involve any dealings with the grey areas of the law?” I inquired delicately.  

  
My Devlin paused for a moment before speaking. “Maybe, maybe not. But I can assure you this. You will not get into any kind of legal trouble. I trust you have been a chauffeur long enough to know when to look the other way. Treat this job like any other, and you'll be just fine," he said in a matter of fact manner. 

  
I still felt a sense of unease over the entire thing and started slowly shaking my head when Mr Devlin said, “Look, Matt, there's no need to rush your decision. If your answer is no, just keep it to yourself for now and you can simply text me your decision tomorrow. My suggestion to you is to take the night to mull things over. It's good easy money you can make in a month. You can probably use it to buy something nice for Luke.  However, there is no pressure from my side. Your employer will not receive bad feedback from me, if you choose to reject this offer. So, I’ll leave it entirely up to you.” he added, reassuringly.

  
I nodded back at him smiling, grateful that he was open and direct with me.   
“Alright then. I guess it’s time to get back on my feet” he said as he prepared to exit from the car. I quickly got out of the vehicle to open the door for him. 

  
Mr Devlin shook hands with me and started his walk to the hotel. I saw him slowly climb up those stairs and enter through the doors of the newly built Trident Regency hotel.   
The following day, just like I was told, I received a text on my phone at 7:00 PM sharp. It gave the location of the pick-up, and also reminded me to be on time.

  
I sat down and looked at the gold ticket that was lying on my bedside table. Picking it up, I examined it closely, feeling its weight in my hand as I patted it on my palm. It’s certainly worth a considerable chunk of money, especially if I was to come in possession of another 30 of them. 

  
Plus, the elegantly embossed ruby encrusted trident on both sides of the card was only going to add to its value. 

  
On one hand, I had a bad feeling about this, knowing fully well the client from last night could be involved in a questionable line of work. But I also saw this as an opportunity to make some quick money. 

  
It's only a month-long gig, requiring a few hours of driving each day.  I could easily be making 2-3 times my annual salary within that time frame. Maybe even more, once I get to know exactly how much these cards are worth. 

  
‘I mean how bad could it really get?’, I asked myself, when I really thought about it.    
I might probably be required to drive people to an illegal gambling joint, or take a VIP client to visit his favorite hooker in the middle of the night. Nobody is going to hire a premium car service to indulge in petty crime, I reasoned.   
My eyes then shifted toward my son Luke, who was immersed in his studies. He was busy tackling a new math problem, and that made me break into a smile. He was probably the only kid in the world who liked the idea of homework. Give him a few books that pique his interest and he needs to be constantly reminded to eat.

  
‘Maybe I could sell the tickets and deposit the proceeds in a bank. Leave it untouched for a few years, letting it slowly collect interest over time. And when Luke gets older, the money could come in handy to pay for college,’ I thought

  
The more I contemplated, the more I wanted to take on this job. So I replied back saying that I would be there. I got ready and dressed, and was out the door in twenty minutes. 

  
Before leaving, I reached out to my regular babysitter, Jennifer, who lives with her family on the same floor in the apartment just next to ours. She is very fond of Luke and agrees to keep an eye on him whenever I am away for work 

  
I got into my car and instructed little Roy to be on his best behaviour for the night. Starting the car, I rolled out of my apartment building toward my pick-up point.
