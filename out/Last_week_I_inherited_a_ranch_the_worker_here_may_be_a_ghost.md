Fiirst off, thanks to everyone who listened to my story without calling me completely insane. Honestly, after this week, I wouldn’t blame you if you’re still unsure whether I’m losing my mind. But I have to apologize. I’ve teased you about ghosts before, but today… I want to talk about someone who’s very much alive. Or at least, I think he is.

Coming from England, I never knew much about America, especially Louisiana. The only image I had was from that Disney film with the singing frog. But my ranch... Well, it’s a different story. The geography confuses me. For the most part, it's fine, it sits beside a massive river. To the west of the house is a vast expanse of mangrove trees, endless mud, and stagnant water. But to the east, past the dirt track, there’s a large cattle field , about an acre. There’s a tiny tin shack where the cattle stay, and the land itself is full of deep holes filled with murky water. It's hard to make sense of it; the rest of the land around here is wild, untamable marsh. Then, there’s this flat, cultivated field almost as if someone flattened it over the river, trying to make it fit.

But the real story I need to tell you is about my ranch hand. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know where he came from, and I don’t know if he’s alive or if he’s something else.

 I see him now, in fact. From my bedroom on the second floor, I watch him move through the stables, his movements stiff, like one of those old animatronic figures you see at amusement parks. It’s not natural. He’s tossing hay into the rundown, decaying stables without breaking a sweat, like the weight of it doesn’t bother him at all. The worst part? There are no horses in those stables. The hay just piles up, left to rot on the damp floor, the smell of decaying straw thick in the air. Every time I step outside, it hits me like the stench of rotting corpses. I want to scream at him to stop, but I can’t. I’m afraid of him.

And heres another thing I don't know his first name, he just goes by Anderson. The same last name my dad had. But no, he can’t be related. If he were, he would have inherited the ranch, wouldn’t he? Unless he’s a distant cousin, some half uncle. But there’s something off about him, something I can’t put my finger on. He's so rude. I don’t think he’s very bright. Mostly, he just grunts when I try to talk to him. But there’s something else in his eyes. A spark of cruelty, something I can’t ignore. Maybe I’m just being paranoid after everything that’s happened, but I can see it, clear as day.

I want to tell you about two encounters I had with him. The first one happened on my very first night here, at the ranch. I was still shaken from my ghost encounter earlier that day, trying to settle into the manor. I’d just gotten ready for bed and was creeping toward the lam, bracing myself to face the darkness when I saw him. He was walking down the dusty track massive, looming. Nearly seven feet tall. His clothes were dirty, stained with something dark. He wore a greasy baseball cap and had a patchy, untamed mullet. He looked… wrong, like something out of place. He grabbed a pitchfork and began shoveling cattle muck into a big bucket. 

I stood frozen, watching him from the window. My heart pounded in my chest, my mind racing. I didn’t know what to do. Every time he lifted his head, I half expected him to see me, to come for me. But he didn’t. He didn’t look malformed like the ghost from earlier he just looked... dirty, like someone who’d been living in filth for years. After what felt like an eternity, he finished and stomped off down the track. Before he disappeared from view, he turned and shot me a glare intensely, blazing. Like he was marking me, deciding if I was a threat. Then, he was gone.

Two days ago, I got up early to feed the cattle. They’re beautiful creatures, very calming. The cow shed was barely holding together rust streaking down its walls, the air thick with the scent of mold and manure. Flies buzzed lazily, landing on me no matter how many times I swatted them away. There was a chill to the wind, sharp and biting, the kind of cold that makes your bones ache. The cattle could feel it, too they were on edge, skittish, like something was wrong.

I had just finished putting their food out when I saw him.

“Morning, mate,” i chimed trying to act kindely despite how much i fear him“It’s bloody warm today, isn’t it?”

“Spose,” he responded, with a sound that was less like speech and more like a snort. He didn’t even look at me when he spoke. And when I looked at him—well, I try not to be rude, but his face... It looked like something out of a nightmare. A huge, bloated mass of a man, his eyes too wide, his features twisted and unkempt like a hog with human skin.

“I, uh... I wanted to ask you something. How much am I meant to be paying you? I didn’t even know you worked here, and, well, I don’t have much money right now,” I asked, my voice trembling more than I meant it to.

“Nothing. I work for free,” Anderson grunted, his voice flat, void of emotion. The way he said it was wrong like he’d said it a thousand times before, like it wasn’t even a choice. His eyes met mine, and I couldn’t look away. His pupils were wide too wide and it felt like he could see straight through me, reading every fear I had, like he was savoring it.

“I well, surely I should pay you something? You’ve been saving me a lot of work…” I started, my throat dry, but I barely finished the sentence before he took a step closer. His sweat clung to him, thick, stinking. He wore nothing but ragged dungarees, and his scent hit me all at once—rank, sour, like death itself.

“Anything for... family,” he muttered, his voice colder than before, dragging the words out with deliberate slowness. The pause that followed stretched on forever. My stomach twisted, a knot of dread tightening as I fought the urge to run. But before I could speak, before I could react, he turned and... ran off. No, not just ran he sprinted, faster than any man should be able to. It was unnatural, and I could feel my heart hammering in my chest as he disappeared into the distance, like a shadow vanishing before dawn.

That moment keeps replaying in my mind. What terrifies me most about him is that he’s not a ghost, not something intangible that fades away in the light of day. No, he’s real. A living, breathing man or whatever he is. I keep wondering, maybe he’s just socially awkward. Maybe I’m overreacting. But I don’t think so. There’s something dark about him, something lurking beneath the surface. The way he said “family”... It was too cold, too distant. And when I look at him, I feel like a stranger on my own land. As if I’m the ghost here. As if I don’t belong. But this is MY ranch.

I guess every family has that one distant relative,the drunk uncle, the cousin who makes Christmas dinners uncomfortable. And maybe Anderson’s mine. But… not to sound cruel, but why did he survive that massacre and not my father? 

I guess what I’m really trying to say is... I’m struggling to run this ranch, even without the ghosts. What I needed was help, support, not this... thing.

I don’t know who Anderson is. I don’t know where he came from. I don’t even know if he’s alive, or if he’s something else entirely. But there’s something he’s hiding from me. Something He knows about this place. And I can’t shake the feeling that ghosts aren’t the only thing I should be afraid of. Should I ask him? Or would that be the worst mistake I could make?
