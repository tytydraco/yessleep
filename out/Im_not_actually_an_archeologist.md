But I do like to travel and get a solid grasp on different ancient cultures especially ones lost in time. My latest travels have brought me to the cradle of civilization in what would be ancient Sumer. 

I managed to snag a very private tour through a friend— of the Ziggurat of Ur. My friend is very well connected to curator al-Gizzy. Closed to the public getting inside was rather difficult even with the curators consent. Set to the backdrop of a rather baron desert the Ziggurat seemed to be quite alive at night, security tight.

My friend knows about my rather unorthodox beliefs and understanding of ancient human history. You see, I’m what they call an “ancient astronaut theorist”, but of independent research. I’ve been black balled by the mainstream community for my aggressive approach. I’m willing to break the law in search of the truth.

But I digress… we had to slip by a few of the guards who weren’t buying our unofficial hall pass by al-Gizzy who wanted very little connection with this particular private tour. My friend got me into a small “hidden” chamber that required extensive knowledge of the ziggurat. Literally untouched for about a decade this chamber was adorned with ancient cuneiform inscriptions, unidentified by modern linguists to this day. 

My friend always said this chamber made him uncomfortable so he told me I was on my own from here.

“I’ll keep the car running” he said, with an exceedingly deep accent.

I scoured the four perfectly square walls, about the size of a small modern bedroom for clues lying in the cuneiform. For some odd reason, there was a section of cuneiform that almost called out to me in a far corner that sat behind me. 

Just before I turned to approach that section my hair stood on end. The energy in the chamber shifted. Something didn’t seem right. The air in the chamber seemed to stop moving. I lifted my battery powered lantern in the direction of the chamber that called to me, shadows fleeing from its glowing light. Just as my lantern got to its peak I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a figure, blocking the section of cuneiform in question. This particular shadow seemed to linger until I approached it and dissipated before I got to the wall.

As I studied the fragment again, my hair stood on end and I felt watched— not alone.

*CRACK*

The wall in front of me seemed to shift, revealing seams much like a doorway that were not previously there. I looked around to see if maybe somebody had heard the loud noise and came to investigate… nothing. Again, I was alone.

I pushed on the “door” which happened to open relatively effortlessly given its size and the fact it was made from stone. Something called to me again. This almost seemed like an itch that needed scratching. I wasn’t going to wait for permission, I was going in.

Entering another chamber which was seemingly substantially larger given my lantern couldn’t even make out walls other than the one behind me which I just came through, I felt uneasy. 

A gust of air went by me, causing me to jump and immediately torches along a room much larger and higher lit up simultaneously. My heart sank. At the other end of this massive room (which I assumed was the center of this ziggurat) stood a figure. I couldn’t make out whether or not it was a statue or a living entity, again it called to me.

I begrudgingly moved towards it.

It moved.

Whatever it was it shifted and contorted into a humanoid being, of which I was still too far to make out the details. I froze.

*”Come forward, child.”* It whispered. Still, I held strong. I felt something invisible wrap around my throat so tightly that I couldn’t breathe. My body moved forward with a quickness, my feet dragging through the sand.

*”You are here, because you come from a long line of pure royalty. Your ancestry reaches back to your original member, Emmeduranki, a child from the stars. You’ve been chosen to set in motion a series of events that will bring about the end of this world, in order to transition to the next.”* Again, its voice was a whisper. As I got closer I could make out its now inhuman, contorted shape. Its body was almost entirely jet black, and seemed to glisten as if wet. Its eyes, also black and vacant. The horns protruding from its skull wrapped like a goats and almost reached past its face which was contorted and somewhat human. It had hooves on the bottom, scaled wings on its back, the tail of a fish and talons for hands. Its torso seemed like a dysmorphic muscular build of a man, minus the breast’s. 

“W-what are you?” I stammered. The being seemed unfazed by my question.

*”You are the only living direct descendant of an ancient star child who ruled these lands for 26,000 years. Where he has failed, you will succeed.”*

“WHAT ARE YOU?!” I yelled, tears welling up in my eyes. This time, the being snapped into the conversation. It smiled, a sinister smile lined with razor sharp teeth.

*”Throughout the years we’ve been called many things. Some cultures called us demons. These days they’d likely call us extra terrestrial. We are far more than that, we are we they revered us as in ancient times. We are god.”*

As quickly as I had been swept across the floor I was out.

I woke up in the woods in a location that was clearly no where near the deserts of Iraq. Getting up I realized I was in the woods out behind my house. 

Stumbling into my house it seemed nobody had been there in months.

Again I felt another call, this time in the direction of true north. I don’t know where I’m going, but it doesn’t feel right. Something is going to happen soon, and you can’t save yourself.
