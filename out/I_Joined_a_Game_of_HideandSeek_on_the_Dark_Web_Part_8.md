The stream cut off and the world fell silent. My mouth was dry, my mind reeling. [They’d changed](https://www.reddit.com/user/DantesGhost92/comments/1egjxu1/i_joined_a_game_of_hideandseek_on_the_dark_web/) the game again. How could they have changed it again, this wasn’t fair. It was no longer Hide-and-Seek, not that it had been that for a while. Now it felt more like the last man standing.

As I sat there, dumbstruck, I was yanked back to reality by a frantic rustling sound next to me. Slowly, I turned my head and looked over to Jenny, and my blood ran cold. She was standing there, facing me, her eyes brimming with tears. Her face, that look on her face. She looked like she was in so much pain, barely able to hold back the sobs that threatened to overtake her. 

In her shaking hands, she held the same pistol she’d bludgeoned me with earlier. Although she was shaking violently, there was no mistaking the fact that the barrel was pointed directly at my chest. With a soft click, she pulled the hammer back.

“Jenny, no…”

“I’m sorry David, but you heard him!” She bit back her tears, wiping away the few that escaped with the back of her sleeve. “You heard what he said, it’s everyone for themselves now!”

“You don’t have to do this Jenny, we can still-”

“Yes, I do David!” The trembling grew more frantic and the barrel of the gun shook more violently, “God knows I don’t want to, I really don’t want to…”

As scared as I was that this was it, that I’d come to the end of my run, I didn’t blame Jenny for anything she was doing. She was scared, just like me, she just wanted to survive. The Organisers knew what they were doing, turning us against each other like this. Although she had a gun pointed at my chest, she was as much a victim of the game as I would be.

Sure, at that moment I’d thought about rushing her and taking the gun, but how long would I have before she fired? I could try and tackle her, the distance between us was short enough that if I was quick, I’d surprise her. But she was terrified, and the gun was already tracked on me, all it would take was a momentary twitch. If I miscalculated, even by a second, I’d be no better off. No, I needed a better way out of this.

Closing my eyes for a second and taking in a breath, the musty, stale air of the warehouse filled my nostrils. The only sounds that met my ears were soft sniffles as Jenny tried to maintain her composure, and the shaking of the pistol in her wavering grip. Then it came to me.

“Look David, if it's you or me, then I have to do what’s best for me. If it was you with the gun wouldn't you do the same? You have to believe me, I really don't want to do this” Although she was talking to me, it sounded more like she was trying to justify to herself what she was about to do.

“Then don’t” The words came out firmly, surprising even me, masking the utter panic that threatened to overtake me at any moment. 

“What do you mean?” Her voice cracked a little, thrown slightly by my response.

“Don’t do it” I repeated, firmly, opening my eyes again and staring directly into hers. “Don’t pull the trigger. Don’t put on a show for those freaks. If you shoot me now, you’ll be doing exactly what they want.”

Her face wavered as she took in my words, the confidence leaving her eyes slightly, although the gun remained still silently pointed at my chest.

“Besides, do you think that, even if you survive and make it to the end, they’ll let you live? Think about it Jenny, why would they? Think about what you’ve seen already, you’d just be a liability to them, there’s no way any of us are walking from this. Not if we play by their rules”

That warmth radiated in my chest again, spreading through my veins as those fires of defiance licked their way through my belly. I’d had enough of this, of this whole thing. The Organisers, running for my life, all of it. Running had only gotten me injured, barely even able to survive. No, I was sick of it. I needed to take matters into my own hands.

“Look, Jenny, the only way we’re making it out of this, the only way any of us are making it out, is if we work together. If we fight back.”

She paused for what felt like an age, barely able to look at me as I stared at her from the floor. Her hand trembled even more fiercely and the barrel of the gun seemed to dip slightly. Now would have been the perfect time to rush her, to tackle her and take the gun, to regain control of this whole shit show. But no, if I wanted this to work then I needed her to trust me.

“But…” Her voice was barely more than a whisper at this point, the few tears that had wiggled their way free were streaming down her cheeks, leaving shimmering trails in the lines of her face. “But what about the Organisers? He said no team-ups…”

I could almost see the thoughts in her head whirling around in the amber lamplight, struggling back and forth as she contemplated what I’d said.

“You heard him as well as I did. What if they come after us, kill us? I don’t want to be on that stage David, I won't…”

She lost her composure at this point, dropping the gun slightly as the dam burst and the torrent of sobbing tears flooded from her. Again this would have been the perfect opportunity, to take that gun, but a part of me knew I didn’t need to, not anymore.

“Fuck the Organisers,” The phrase slid from my tongue so naturally. It felt strong, powerful.  As though all of those weeks of torment, all of the fear, the uncertainty, the rage, had formed together into that one, defiant phrase. It felt good to say it out loud. “It makes no difference them killing me, you killing me, or dying up there on that stage, but at least one way I have a fighting chance to get out of this!”

As she wept, her free hand trying in vain to stem the flow of tears, I could see the argument going on inside her mind, the back and forth in her head as she contemplated exactly what was going to happen from here on out. With bated breath, I waited for what felt like hours, with nothing but the silence and her sobs, while this internal struggle continued, all the while pushing away the nagging doubt that I’d not done enough, that this whole thing may not pay off.

Wiping away the last of her tears, and stifling a sniffle, Jenny finally turned back to me. Her expression, although still uncertain, was harder than before, some of her confidence from earlier seemingly having returned. Her eyes though, gave away the terror still ever present beneath, still worming away at her. 

Although I partially expected the gun to rise, to see the bright flash and smell the burning gunpowder, I tried my best not to flinch, holding that confidence I’d maintained. If I let it slip now, even for a second, then this whole thing would come crashing down, and that would be it.

Her voice was quiet, strained from holding back her tears, but there was something different about it this time.

“... That’s exactly the kind of thing I would say if I wanted to get out of your situation David…”

My blood ran cold. No, no this couldnt be happening. I was so sure I could convince her, so sure that we could work together to make it out of this. I should have just rushed her when I had the chance. That gun was going to rise any second now and that would be it, my suffering would be over, ended in an abandoned warehouse where no one would find me. 

“But you’re right, they’re never going to let us go…” She continued. “Fuck the Organisers”

A surge of joy flushed through me as I looked into her watery eyes, breathing out a relieved sigh, grinning at her. She returned my grin with an unsteady smile, trying her best to maintain her composure, but I could tell she understood what I’d been trying to tell her, that we needed to do this together if we were going to make it out. In the depths of her eyes, I could see the same flicker of defiance that had grown so strong in me.

“Come on,” I said, getting to my feet and slowly making my way over to her. “We’ll figure this out, don’t worry.”

Although she was no longer pointing the gun at me, it was held firmly in her hand. A necessary precaution, just in case. I held my hands up, slowly approaching. “We should probably get some food, I don’t know about you but I’m starving and it’ll be time to sleep soon.”

She let out a small chuckle, although it didn't register on her face. “Sure, I suppose”

Reaching out, I gently rested my hand on her arm. She looked up at me, the defiance still there in her watery eyes. “It’s all going to be ok, isn’t it David? We’ll be ok?...”

“Yeah Jenny, it’ll be fine, we’ll get out of this somehow, don’t you worry” Was all I could say, although deep down I knew I had absolutely nothing to back it up.

Softly leading her over to the small stove she’d set up in the corner of the room, I poured the contents of two of the cans, chicken noodle soup and beans, into two separate pans. Normally I hated soup, but as the pots began to bubble and the smell of the warm broth tantalised my nostrils, I couldn't stop myself from salivating. 

Jenny was unusually quiet, huddled in her corner opposite me, dark shadows crossing her face as she slowly came to terms with what we were doing. I handed her a steaming pan of beans which she took, thanking me, but I could tell her mind was elsewhere.

There was little conversation while we ate, only the occasional comment about the video Jenny had put on her phone. It was nothing more than background noise at that point, but I still tried to draw some comfort from it. Although her silence caused a stirring of anxiety in me, I could tell she was having trouble dealing with the dangers inherently involved in defying the Organisers. 

I tried my best to reassure her whenever she looked at me, smiling at her and trying my best to seem confident. Although that fire of defiance was still burning brightly, the gnawing fear of what was going to happen next felt ever-present, eating away at my thoughts whenever I let my guard down.

I knew what they were capable of. A shudder ran down my spine as I remembered how they’d taken two of my fingers when I hid in the same place for a few days, how they pulled a Hunter out of hospital and killed him on that stage. It wasn’t hard to imagine them escalating things further.

Leaning against one of the walls of the office room, the cool concrete pressed firmly against my back as I sat there, sifting through my thoughts. We were entering into a fight that I had no idea if we could win, but I needed to stay focused, to stay confident. I knew that my confidence was the only thing keeping Jenny from breaking down at this point. As much as she was trying her best to keep going, she was struggling.

Sleep came uneasily for us both that night. We took turns keeping watch while the other slept, all the while unsure of exactly what the night would bring. As I lay there, forcing myself to stay away while Jenny kept watch, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this might be a mistake. Although the Organisers could have no way of knowing what was happening, or what we were doing, neither of us could quite shake the feeling that they were already making plans to deal with us.

The next day passed uneasily as we hid out in that empty space. The slightest sound from outside set us on edge as we expected to see the metal sheets covering the windows wrenched back, the glaring sunlight blinding us temporarily as an Organiser forced their way inside. 

Small sounds from outside filtered in through the holes in the roof and the cracks in the boards covering the windows. The engines of cars as they drove past, the sounds of heavy machinery from other sites on the estate. They may as well have been sounds from another world. 

A couple of times, through the background noise, we could have sworn that we heard the sound of something banging against the sealed-off doors, as though someone was testing them for a way in. Looking back, it could have been anything, the wind rattling them, an animal bumping against them. But it still didn't stop my heart from jumping up into my throat each time.

For the most part, we sat there in silence the next day, each alone with their thoughts, until that uneasy silence was shattered by the high-pitched pinging which had haunted me for so long.

It only came from my phone this time, and it made my blood run cold as I knew exactly what it meant. Tentatively pulling my phone from my pocket, sure enough, my heart sank. There was a notification from The Devil’s Game’s app, sitting there like a portent of doom. I’d wondered how long it would take for the Organisers to catch on to our team-up. 

“Is that them?” Lifting her head from her hands, and sounding as though she’d just been pulled from a faraway slumber, Jenny’s attention was now fixed on me.

“Yep, right on cue,” I said, trying my best to force the terror that had wormed its way up out of my voice. As defiant as I’d felt yesterday, seeing the message in front of me had knocked me, the reality of what I was doing beginning to set in. I wasn’t going to play by their rules, but that didn't mean I was going to get out of this unscathed.

Slowly getting to her feet, Jenny sidled over to me, sitting down a small distance away, all the while keeping her eyes on the shattered screen of my phone. Holding my breath, trying to suppress the slight tremble in my finger, I clicked on the notification. The familiar black background of the app overtook the screen, before loading in a new private message. I didn’t even have a chance to read the text, my attention was immediately drawn to the other thing contained in the message.

A picture, only one, but it was enough for the blood to drain from my face. I could see my wife and son clearly, sitting there at the cafe not too far from our house. It was a spot we would go to regularly. Cooper loved it there, Charlotte and I would take him most weekends as a treat. They were both there, having something to drink as though they had no other care in the world. Looking at that picture, I wanted nothing more than to be with them at that moment, to be as far away from all of this as possible.

Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision as I imagined how they must be feeling right now. Charlotte would be worried, she’d not heard from me in weeks now, not even so much as a text message. She’d sent me several, but I’d not replied, not wanting to drag her into all of this. I was sure she’d understand once I explained, once I was free, but right now that was just how it needed to be. She was probably trying her best to carry on, to make things seem as normal for Cooped as possible, but he was nearly six years old now. I was sure he’d have picked up on his mother's anxiety, even if he didn’t fully realise that his daddy may never come home.

Trying to shake away the thoughts cutting at me like a knife, I dragged my attention to the text above the message. Immediately that sadness and self-pity were forced from me, replaced by a deeper, colder fear. There was only a single line, but that was all they needed to get their point across. “It’s her or them, David. Your Choice.”

“Who’s that?” Jenny asked, obviously having seen the picture over my shoulder. Although she tried to keep her expression neutral, it was impossible to mistake the fear in her voice. Her right hand seemed to be nervously messing with something inside her coat pocket, I had an idea of what that might be.

Turning the screen away from her, I didn’t answer, thoughts whirling around in my head too fast for me to process. Memories of Charlotte, of when we met, of when we got married, of when Cooper was born. I remembered Cooper’s first steps, his first words, when he first went to nursery. It was all coming crashing down. All I could think about was how this was all my fault, that no matter how hard I seemed to try, I couldn’t keep them safe.

The thoughts swirled faster, forming a dark maelstrom as those beautiful, nostalgic memories intermingled themselves with the memories of the Hunters, of the crash, of the bird-masked man and the masked brute. They were going to kill my family and it would be all my fault. 

Although it looked like they’d given me a choice in the message, I knew deep down there was no way I’d be able to keep them safe. Every if I did what they wanted this time, the next time I did something the Organisers didn’t like, any time I stepped out of line, they’d just threaten them again. Hell, they’d already done it before, when I went out of bounds on that first day. All it would take is for them to decide that enough was enough, and then Charlotte and Cooper would be dead anyway.

I looked over to Jenny, the tears still blurring my vision, and took in her face. Her terrified, youthful face, barely holding it together. At some point, she would have been someone's little girl just as Cooper was my little boy. Could I really take all of that away from someone? 

Could I kill her in cold blood, and even if I did, what would be to say that the Organisers wouldn’t just kill my family anyway to send a message? They were unpredictable, it wasn't beyond the realm of possibility that they would do something like that to show me I was worthless to them.

The vortex of thoughts was becoming too much for me, they all vied for a place in the spotlight, each bringing a new emotion with them. I felt wretched, cold sweat began to form as I wrestled, torn between an impossible choice. Closing my eyes, I tried to fight against the torrent, to clear my head enough to think, but it all felt in vain. But there was one thought, one quiet, dark thought, which slowly dragged itself to the forefront of my mind.

They were using my family to control me, that much was obvious, so if they killed them then what leverage would they have? They probably knew I’d resigned myself to the fact that I probably wasn't getting out of this game alive, so threatening my life wasn't going to work, and I had nothing else, not really. If they killed my family they’d have nothing, no leverage. If they killed Charlotte and Cooper, they’d take everything from me, everything except my rage. And that, I would make sure, would be their mistake.

As much as I hated myself for it, I found myself chewing on the thought, contemplating it as Jenny sat there, eyes wary, watching me. It felt like an age passed as I stared at the image of Charlotte and Cooper. Breathing out a shaky sigh, I forced my fingers to type a response, hesitating for a moment before pressing the send icon. Locking the phone again, I tossed it away. It clattered to the other side of the room, breaking the awful silence that had been pressing down on us as I dropped my head into my palms to hide my tears. 

“David… What was that, are you ok?” Jenny’s voice was wary as she furtively reached out a hand, gingerly rubbing my back. “Who were those people in the picture?”

“Charlotte and Cooper, my wife and son,” I replied, my voice catching in my throat as I held back sobs. I paused for a while, unsure if I should say what I said next. “They told me it was either you or them…”

Her face grew pale at that and the hand rubbing my back lifted slightly as she shifted her position. Although I wasn't looking at her, I could imagine the expression of terror now spreading across her face as she looked at me, expecting the worst.

“What did you tell them?” Although she tried to hide it, the tremor in her voice was unmistakable.

I could hear her nervously reaching back into her coat, her small, frantic movements resounding in my head. She was terrified, and trying to hide it, terrified I’d turn on her at any moment. I couldn't blame her, a part of me still wasn't sure if I should.

“If you kill them, then what have I got to lose?” Sobs racked me again before I could get the last words out. 

Saying it out loud felt like I’d condemned them to death. All I could do was cling to that fire of defiance, that light in my chest that said I was right, that this was a bluff.  Nausea washed over me and a pit formed in my stomach just thinking about the alternative.

“Oh god David, I’m so sorry.” Her voice cracked as she spoke, with relief or with sadness I wasn't quite sure. Either way, she stopped messing with her coat pocket, slowly making her way over to me again and wrapping her arms tightly around me in a warm embrace. Although I wanted nothing more than to be left alone right now, I didn't have the strength to push her away.

Still sobbing at what I’d done, we sat there on the cold concrete floor of the office. I could feel her breathing against my side, feel the soft warmth of her tears dripping onto my shoulder as she cried along with me. Neither one of us moved or spoke for a long time, we just wallowed in our grief. Then, Jenny whispered, breaking the soft silence once again.

“I’d heard rumours that they were threatening people’s families, but I never thought…”

Slowly turning to face her, I wiped the tracks of tears from my cheeks. “What do you mean?”

“Back when all of this started, after… you know… I was on my own looking for somewhere to hide out. I’d struggled to find a good place so I was wandering by an office block. I thought maybe if I could sneak in as people were leaving I could hide inside. Anyway, I was walking down one of the main streets, when I bumped into one of the Hunters. Luckily I spotted him before he saw me, but he chased me. He nearly caught me too,” 

She paused, a misty look filling her eyes. I couldn’t help but notice the sadness that seemed to wash over her face as the memory replayed in her mind.  

Unblinking, she continued “but I managed to climb over this fence at the end of an alley. There was no way he could have done it, he was way too heavy. Anyway, as I ran, he shouted to me about how they’d kill his family if he didn’t catch me. At the time I thought it was a trick, a way of him getting me to stop…”

Again, her voice cracked and she paused, looking down before speaking to the floor “Well, I didn’t realise it was true…”

A fresh coldness washed over me as the full implication of Jenny’s story hit me. The Hunters, those people I’d thought of as mere psychopaths, were the same as us. I imagined if that were me, if I’d been forced to hunt people down, knowing I was sending them to their deaths, and that if I didn’t give a satisfactory performance then Charlotte and Cooper would be forfeit. 

A face forced its way to the front of my mind, the face of the first Hunter I encountered, the man from the crash. Did he have a family at home? He didn’t seem like a crazed maniac, he was probably just a random man, someone like me, fearing for his family's life. 

Guilt crashed down over me as I imagined him on the stage, how terrified he must have been, how terrified they all must have been before that masked freak executed them all. The fire in my chest rose again as I thought of the bird-masked man. This was all his fault. He’d tried to separate us, turn us against each other, but ultimately it was the Oragnisers who were responsible for each and every death this game had inflicted.

Anger burned through me as I wiped away my tears. I wasn’t going to let them get away with this. I had no idea how, but I wasn’t going to be another number in this sick game. Jenny and I were getting out of this, and we were getting out alive. 

If they wanted to take us, then I was sure as hell going to make sure it wasn't easy. I’d thought about it a little before, back when I was on the roof of the supermarket, ways to stop any enterprising Hunters from getting to me. I’d tried to come up with ideas for traps, improvised defences. The roof hadn't been the most defensible place, but here, we could turn this place into a fortress.

Even if we couldn’t stop the Organisers from getting in, at least we could put things in place to give us a fighting chance, an early warning so we could escape. It was better than hanging around here just waiting for them to come.

When I suggested the idea to Jenny, her face baulked. I had no idea what she was thinking, but it was obvious that the prospect of actually fighting back so violently hadn’t been on the cards for her. She was reluctant to entertain the idea at first, I think she was probably worried about the consequences if we failed.

It took a lot of convincing, but I gently reminded her that, thanks to our little team-up, those consequences would already be there anyway. We would already be on their naughty list, there was nowhere to go from there so we may as well embrace it.

After a bit more back and forth, although she still seemed reluctant, Jenny finally seemed to come to terms with the idea, although I think the thought of coming so close to the Organisers terrified her. If I’m honest, there was another thought that fueled her reluctance. One that I’d had too, one that I tried my hardest to ignore as I didn’t want to deal with the consequences it brought. What if the traps actually killed some of them? We’d officially be murderers then, no ambiguity either way.

Pushing that thought down as far as I could, we spent the rest of the night planning, making lists of exactly what we would need. We could set off in the morning, carefully, and gather our supplies. Then the real work would begin.

I’ll be honest, although a large part of me was absolutely terrified of what could happen when the Organisers finally decided to come for us, I couldn’t help but feel that this was going to work. They’d never suspect Jenny and I of being capable of such aggression, and that would be to their detriment. Accompanying those feelings of rage and scorn, however, was another, more insidious feeling. A gnawing darkness at the back of my mind, it had been there ever since I'd sent that reply. The Organisers hadn’t responded back.

I’d expected a message, something mocking me or threatening me, something at least, not this god-awful silence. I didn’t know what it meant. What if I’d made the wrong choice? Forcing those thoughts away again, I tried my best to focus on the here and now. If I let myself think about it, I feared I’d trip into a spiral I’d not be able to escape. 

Despite the anxiety, sleep came a little easier that night, the plans for the makeshift traps comforting me as I lay there in the darkness of our soon-to-be fortress. Eventually, the dulled sunlight seeping in through the holes in the roof signalled the arrival of the morning, and with it the start of our fight against those sadistic assholes who’d tormented us for so long now. 

An uneasy quiet filled the air as we ate our breakfast, another hearty pan of tinned beans heated on Jenny’s portable stove. Neither of us could bring ourselves to discuss what we were about to do, we just ate in silence. An hour seemed to crawl by as we waited for the shops to open. We’d share furtive glances, giving the other a weak smile when we noticed, but it didn't take a genius to figure out we were both apprehensive. Then, finally, the time came.

Checking through our list again, standing before the corrugated metal sheet, we ran through each item, making sure there was nothing we could have possibly missed. I only wanted to do this once. Get out, grab what we needed, then come back. The longer we were out there, the more exposed we were. When neither of us was able to come up with anything extra, we slid our relative scraps of paper into our pockets and slowly lifted the metal sheet.

Peering through the crack, the light outside stung my eyes slightly as I scanned the perimeter, looking for any signs of movement. Anyone could have been hiding there, just out of sight. I didn’t think the Organisers would have come for us just yet, but if I was wrong about that then we’d be walking right into a trap.

The industrial estate was quiet, and still. Just like when I’d arrived, the place was deserted. The roaring of engines on the main road floated over the buildings, the distant sounds diluted as they fought their way between the empty structures. Outside, the grass before the warehouse was clear and untouched, just as it had been each day previously. 

Looking back to Jenny, I nodded my head, whispering “All clear, you ready?”

She looked back at me, the flicker of defiance in her eyes still burning away. “Ready!” she nodded.

Turning back to the window, I steeled myself, taking in a deep breath. Gingerly, I shifted the sheet further, the crack slowly widening out into an opening. No longer having to worry about alerting someone, I carefully climbed out, being sure to avoid putting pressure on my injured ribs or leg, before looking around again. 

A part of me had expected to see a figure charging at me, ready to tackle me to the ground before I had a chance to run, and drag me off to god knows where. But much to my relief, there was still nothing, just the empty roads of the estate. Pulling my hood up to hide my face, I started to make my way back towards the streets of the city, all the while on high alert, my eyes darting from side to side, scanning for any signs of movement.

Once I reached the corner of the street I turned back. Checking that the coast was still clear, I gave a quick wave. Seeing the signal, Jenny clambered out of the window. She landed gracefully, brushing herself off before slowly replacing the sheeting. It struck me again exactly how uncanny it looked when it was put back. This place really was the perfect hiding spot.

We set off into the streets, Jenny hanging back a little as I walked ahead. For this to work we needed to get in and out as quickly as possible. The more time we were out in the city, the less protected we were. We’d be sitting ducks for not only the Organisers, but any opportunistic Fighters that might stumble across us. At least if we maintained a bit of distance between us, then if one of us got into trouble the other wouldn’t be spotted. They’d have the element of surprise, or at least a better chance of escape anyway. Both of us hoped it didn’t come to that, but we had to be prepared.

Taking the lead, I walked along a couple of side streets, back towards the hustle and bustle of the main roads. All the while I was checking in the reflections of the shop windows for anything odd, anyone following me or tracking our movements. I caught glimpses of Jenny, still following from behind, maintaining a good distance like we’d planned. 

Ahead there were barely any cars in the street, it felt almost surreal to see such empty roads, although it was pretty early in the morning. The only car I’d seen so far was a large black van, idling away on the other side. That was good, the fewer cars and people around, the better. In its scuffed reflective side, Jenny and I locked eyes. I tried to give her my best, reassuring smile, which she tried her best to return.

Against my better judgement, I allowed myself to relax slightly. Things felt like they were going smoothly, and I couldn’t help but think back to the mall, back when we were working together as a cohesive unit. A small smile crawled across my lips as I let those memories wash over me.

After a few minutes of uneventful walking, we managed to make it to a small, rundown-looking hardware store. It was only about ten minutes away from the warehouse, I’d remembered seeing it on my way past as I’d been tracking Jenny. I hoped against hope that the walk back would be just as uneventful.

Pushing the door, the small bell above it rang gently, signalling our presence to the owner. My heart sank as I scanned around the meagre inside. Although I was hoping it would be the only store we’d need to go to, it was so poorly stocked I could hardly believe it, the shelves half empty of anything that might be of use. Behind me, the bell sounded again as Jenny entered, and I could tell from the look on her face she was thinking the same thing.

We didn’t even manage to get half of the things on our lists. The cashier, who’d been watching us as we made our way around his store, gave us a suspicious look as we laid our purchases out on the counter. To be honest, I can't say I blamed him, I mean it's not every day that people buy several lengths of nylon rope, twenty circular saw blades, ten packs of wiping rags and four jerry cans of kerosine. Still, I think he was grateful for the business, and he didn’t press us with any questions.

Loading our equipment into our backpacks, Jenny whispered across to me “That’s literally all they had? What a waste of time. We can’t do anything with this!”

The disappointment in her voice was palpable. I understood, I felt exactly the same.

“Yeah, I know, this isn’t how I saw this going. Let me see if I can find another store”

We thanked the shopkeeper as we left, the bell jingling again as the door shut behind us. This was less than ideal, now we’d need to make our way further into the city to look for another store. Checking on my phone, my heart sank yet again. I was able to find another one, but it was at least another twenty-minute walk, and that was twenty more minutes of being exposed.

Jenny was looking at me expectantly, waiting for me to confirm exactly what we were going to do next. Slipping my phone back into my pocket, I was just about to explain about the other store, when something caught my eye causing a chill to inch its way across the back of my neck. Outside the store was a large, black van. Although it took me a second to confirm it, it was the same one I’d seen Jenny’s reflection in, the scuffs along its outer door were unmistakable.

It might have just been a coincidence, my paranoid mind blowing it out of proportion, but this road had been particularly quiet, and that van had been parked at the other end, what possible reason could they have for moving up here, specifically to outside of this shop?

Reading my expression, Jenny’s nervous smile seemed to retreat, warping into a tense grimace. I think she tried to ask me something, I can remember hearing her voice, but I wasn’t listening, my attention was too focused on the van. Something about it didn’t sit right with me. They could have been anyone, painters or plumbers, anyone. But I couldn’t shake the question. Why was it here? Slowly, working my eyes up to the windows, that sense of unease grew.

They were tinted black, and although I could just about make out a slight movement from inside, I couldn't see the driver clearly. Something about the inside made the chill crawling down my spine intensify, and goosebumps broke out across my flesh. The voice in the back of my head was screaming at me that this was a bad idea, but I needed to get a better look.

Jenny was speaking again, probably repeating her question as I ignored her, stepping away towards the front of the vehicle. I could make out her frustrated gestures in the corner of my eye, but my gaze never drifted from the van.

The front window slowly came into view with each step I took. Unlike the tinted side windows, it was clear, even if it was a little grimy. With the entire cabin in full view, it took me a moment to register what I was seeing inside. My brain was struggling to make sense of the sight, but after a few seconds my blood ran cold and I stopped dead.

Looking back at me was what I’d at first assumed was a green bust, propped against the driver's seat where their head should have been. The spiked points of the crown it wore jutted out at odd angles above its head, giving it an uneven appearance. I had to squint a little to tell what it was, racking my brain slightly, but then it clicked. The Statue of Liberty. 

It was a poor attempt to recreate her head, albeit on a much smaller scale. I chuckled a little at the fact I’d allowed myself to be spooked by something as silly as a statue. But as I was about to breathe a sigh of relief, it moved, turning to face me, and that sigh caught in my lungs as it brought with it one of the biggest waves of terror that I think I’ve ever felt. 

My eyes were locked onto the eyes of the Statue of Liberty mask, I could hardly move. It felt like I’d been frozen in place, terror coursing through my veins. They were here, the Organisers were here!

Sounds seemed to pass me by as I stood there for what felt like an age. The engines of other cars in the distance, Jenny’s raised voice as she demanded to know what was going on, and the sound of her footsteps as she got closer. 

All I could do was stare into that mask. How had they come after us so soon? How didn’t I notice them, I thought I was better than that? My stomach dropped as something else moved in the cabin of the van. A black gloved hand rose from beneath the dashboard, its open palm showing as it waved back and forth at me, the finders wiggling slightly. 

My mouth dried and my scalp pulled tight, I imagined the eyes of the person behind it, barely containing their glee. The dawning realisation of what all this meant hit me so hard I felt like it winded me. If the Organisers were here, they were only here for one thing. Us!

A tugging sensation to my right dragged me out of my daze as Jenny pulled frantically at my arm, her terrified expression now having morphed to one of annoyance at being ignored.

“David, seriously, what is going on with y-” 

“Jenny… RUN!!” Was all I could muster, cutting her off mid-sentence.

The hurt that seeped into her expression was quickly replaced by one of utter terror as she turned her gaze to the window. Grabbing her wrist, I set off at a charge, dragging her with me as I tried to put as much distance between myself and that van as possible. 

My injured leg was screaming at the exertion. My ribs were beginning to give me that telltale ache. There was no way I’d be able to keep this up for long. Stumbling slightly, I tried my best to carry on. I didn’t care, we needed to get away, as far away from them as we could, as fast as we could. This wasn't what I’d planned, this wasn't how this was all supposed to go. We were supposed to be ready for them, we were supposed to fight back.

The van’s engine starting up behind me caused my scalp to pull even tighter but I didn’t dare look back. They were going to chase us down, and there was no way we could outrun them. Then another sound reached me and caused my heart to drop a beat in my chest. The sound of the van door opening as heavy boots slammed hard against the concrete.

Even now I can’t quite believe what happened next, we’d thought we were prepared, but we had no idea what they had planned for us. But I need to stop, just for now. Remembering all of this, it’s taking more of a toll on me than I thought. There’s so much I’d forced myself to forget. But I promise I’ll reveal it all as soon as I can.
