They host this event every year at the park near my home. Its a carnvival that's got street performers, games and a free concert.

I decided to go as I had nothing else to do on a saturday evening. I wanted to invite some friends to come along but they were all busy so it was just me. 

When I got there, the first thing I did was eat some snacks from the booths and watch some street performers do their acts. 

Majority of them were clowns who entertained kids with magic tricks, funny dancing, balloon making and whatnot. None of then looked out of place except for one clown. 

This particular clown was surrounded by group of boys who I think were around in their late teens. He didn't wear facepaint like all the others, he wore a detailed horror themed clown mask that had a frown. 

His appearance wasn't the only thing that was strange, it was also his act. He made a balloon sword and then placed it on his crotch and rubbed it like he was masturbating. 

While all the boys were giggling, I just looked at the clown disapprovingly. I was about to say something like 'Knock it off, there are kids here!' but that was when he noticed me.

He then got faster with rubbing the balloon sword while he looked at me until he popped it which made the group of boys burst out laughing. 

I was taken aback. I really wanted to scream my head off but I just decided to walk away while giving them all a dirty look.

I continued on with wandering around the park, watching street performers do their tricks and trying out some of the carnival games. 

I kid you not, wherever I went, the clown was at a distance either doing a magic trick for one or two people or he would be making balloon animals for somebody. The first few times I spotted him, I thought that it was a coincidence that he was always nearby but soon, I started to suspect that he was following me.

By around 8 PM, the concert started so I checked it out. I decided to go home after the band was done playing their fifth or sixth song. When I tried to leave, I accidentally bumped into somebody and I think I felt his fingers brush against my butt. I was about to apologize until I realized it was the clown from earlier. 

I stumbled back and I raised my fists, ready to throw a punch if I had to, I tried to look mad but it was obvious that I was scared out of my mind. I dealt with creeps before and I would usually feel mostly annoyed or angry but something about the clown made me feel just completely scared.

We stared at each other for a few seconds, I was expecting him to do something but he just stood there, tilting his head sideways. I realized that if he did do anything I could call out for help as I was surrounded by people, so I was prepared to scream as loud as possible if he even so much as to lay a finger on me.

I quickly got away from him, constantly looking back to see if he was following me, he was still standing there, staring at me. Even when I was pretty far away, the creep was still staring.

When I left the park and was going home, I still looked back, hoping that the clown wasn't following me. I was on high alert and was ready to make a run for it if I saw anyone dressed like a clown. 

Thankfully, I got home safe.
