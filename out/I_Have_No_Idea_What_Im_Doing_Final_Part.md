“Melissa Ethridge,” I said.

“What?”

“Melissa Ethridge,” I repeated, grabbing the car’s aux cord and plugging my phone in, “Listen”

Destiny twisted her face as the opening chords of Melissa Ethridge’s “Come to my Window” blared through the car speakers.

“Look,” I said, making my sales pitch, “I know its probably not your cup of tea, honestly, I’m not really crazy about 90’s lesbian rock n’ roll either, but it was the first thing that popped in my head when Indigo told us we needed an example of ‘true’ love or beauty.”

“I don’t think it’s a particularly beautiful song,” Destiny said, “Why this song? Why not Boyz II Men? ‘End of the Road’? Now that’s a pretty song”

“Because this is the first song I learned to play on the guitar. My Mom taught me before she died. I think that gives it special meaning to me. Even if it’s not the best song, it’s truly beautiful to me because it has special meaning.

Destiny thought for a beat, folded her arms and said, “Ok, you win. Not like I have any ideas anyway.”

An hour later we were back in my house absolutely blasting Melissa Ethridge out of my stereo system and staring at the leg from behind the couch waiting to see if anything would happen. Nothing did.

We cycled through every musical artist we could think of. Boyz II Men, Tiny Tim, Evanescence, Elton John. We even tried whale calls and several podcasts. Nothing happened other than the lights flickering a bunch when we played the Beach Boys, we got the sense the leg was growing stronger and feeding off the awful music The Beach Boys played so we quickly turned it off.

“Maybe you have to play the music yourself,” Destiny suggested.

It was as good a guess as any, so I grabbed my guitar and started playing “Come to my Window”. Initially, outside of Destiny’s pained wincing, my playing didn’t seem to make much of a difference, but after about 30 seconds the skin on the leg seemed to ripple and move. I focused and sang even harder, which made Destiny wince even harder, but I didn’t mind - it was working! Eventually the leg started to shake like it was having a seizure. Just then a flash of silver caught my eye and I turned to look just in time to dodge the kitchen knife that flew towards my head from the kitchen. That quickly put a stop to my playing.

“Ok, so we’re on the right track,” I said, “It clearly doesn’t like that”

“Yeah,” Destiny replied, “But does it not like it because it’s hurting it and could potentially destroy it? Or because you suck at singing and you’re just really annoying to listen to?”

I turned to face her.

“You sound like a bag of cats in heat,” Destiny was not holding back her feelings on my singing voice.

I ignored the comment, “No, we’re on the right track, but something is missing.”

“If only we could get Melissa Ethridge here to play it for us.” Destiny said sarcastically.

“That’s it!” I shouted, “We need Melissa Ethridge’s guitar! I know there is one hanging on the wall of the Hard Rock Café downtown. Let’s go get it!”

“Your plan is to ask them if you can play Melissa Ethridge’s guitar?”

“We’re not going to ask”

“Your plan is to do a smash-and-grab at a restaurant owned by Native Americans? One of the most oppressed groups of people in the country.”

“Destiny,” I retorted, “The Seminole Tribe of Florida owns several billions of dollars’ worth of real estate and has more white people working for them than Facebook. They aren’t oppressed.”

“Alright, but I’m not going in. I’ll be the lookout with Hercules.”

“Fine.”

5 minutes later we were on the road heading towards the Hard Rock Café. Destiny sat shotgun, Hercules and the leg sat in the back. Hercules sat behind me and I could feel his stinking breath on my neck. It made my eyes water.

“Do you know who stole Hercule’s body from your porch?” I asked, trying to make conversation, “I mean, how will he ever get to rest in peace?”

“I have no idea who did it, but I’m sure Hercules does.” Destiny replied.

The conversation died down again and I turned my focus to the road, periodically checking my surroundings and my mirrors for any sign that Psycho Jimmy could be following us.

“What are you looking for?” Destiny asked, breaking the silence, “You seem, like, really paranoid about something?”

“Oh, I’m just paranoid about the haunted prosthetic leg in the backseat garroting me, you know?”

“Fair point.”

We arrived outside of the Hard Rock Café and quickly realized we had no plan that could feasibly work. After a few minutes of deliberation, we decided to go in and get a table. We were seated between two displays. One of Michael Jackson’s iconic gloves hung in a glass case above my head. Above Destiny’s head hung one of Prince’s electric guitars. Across the restaurant we could see Melissa Ethridge’s guitar encased in glass and hanging above the table of a couple who were clearly fighting with each other.

“There’s the guitar,” I said, nodding towards the display, “We just need a distraction.”

“Ok,” Destiny said, “I got this. Get ready”

She took two steps from our table, let out a dramatic sigh and fake-fainted on the floor of the dining room. No one seemed to notice.

“She’s fainted!” I shouted.

“Fucking TikTokers,” I heard a man mumble from a table near us.

After a few embarrassing moments, Destiny stood up, dusted herself off and sat back down across from me. “That didn’t work”

“No shit.”

“I have an idea for a distraction,” I told Destiny as I pulled out my cell phone, “I got the perfect guy for this.”

I called Psycho Jimmy. He picked up after 3 rings, but didn’t speak. I told him where I was and explained the situation to him and how we needed a distraction. He still didn’t speak. I told him if he could be there in 15 minutes that would be great, but if not, then he shouldn’t worry about it, but I had a feeling he was probably right around the corner.

The line went dead without Jimmy saying a single word.

“Give him 15 minutes,” I told Destiny.

5 minutes later Destiny and I were startled by a low growl that emanated from under our table. It was the snarling of an angry dog. It was Hercules.

Destiny quickly lowered her head under the table and began uttering commands to the phantom dog in a stern, authoritative voice. Patrons of the restaurant, one-by-one, began to take notice of the noise and began to stare.

“What is the issue?” I asked

“I don’t know!” Seethed Destiny.

I glanced around the room at all of the eyes watching us and began to apologize when I noticed Psycho Jimmy walking in through the front door of the restaurant. I began to stand up to greet him but Destiny quickly stole my attention.

“Oh my God!” She said, “This is it. I think Hercules sees whoever stole his body” She had a hand gripping her ghost dog’s invisible collar but was struggling to maintain control over the specter. Several waiters were on their way over to us when Destiny couldn’t hold on any longer.

The invisible phantasmal force that was Hercules exploded from under our table and through the dining room of the restaurant knocking over several chairs and tables in the process. Several patrons of the restaurant who had been tossed to the floor by Hercules or had seen some of the chairs tossed aside by the unseen force started to panic. Just like I had only a few days earlier, they’d suddenly been confronted with the possibility that there are things in this world they cannot explain.

A few people got out of their seats, a few women yelped, a particularly fat man stood on his chair like the ground was suddenly made of lava. The waiters were not paid enough for this.

Hercules continued on his war path through the dining room, pushing more chairs and tables aside and knocking over the hostess before finding his target – Psycho Jimmy.

Jimmy hit the ground with a grunt and began wrestling with his invisible foe. After a few intense seconds of rolling on the ground it appeared Hercules had him by the shirt sleeve and was dragging him back into the dining room, stopping every few steps to ragdoll Jimmy’s arm. Blood splashed out from Jimmy’s forearm as if he was cut by a knife.

This is when everyone really started to lose their minds. The restaurant descended into pandemonium. People who’d never met each other in their lives were clinging together and crying, some were fighting, one lady fainted and one woman too drunk to stand simply took in the scene and laughed.

A punch on my shoulder pulled my attention from the scene. It was Destiny.

“The guitar!” She shouted.

Right.

I ran across the restaurant to the glass case that housed Melissa Ethridge’s guitar, took the prosthetic leg from my backpack and smashed the glass with it sending a thousand razor sharp shards down into the meals of the angry couple who sat beneath it.

“You’re paying for our meals, buddy!” Said the man.

“Dude, look around!” I said back to him, extending an arm towards the insanity unfolding before us, “Just leave!”

I pulled the leg back and smashed the glass case again sending more shards of broken glass down onto the angry couple seated below.

“You NEVER stand up for yourself, Bryan!” The female half of the couple said to her mate, “Look at you, letting this crazy man with a prosthetic leg push you around and ruin our dinner! You’re a Beta!”

An arm grabbed me by the wrist, it was Bryan, “I’m not going to ask you again”

“Dude, get your priorities straight man” I said, pulling back the leg a third time.

A fist connected with my stomach and sent me to the ground. The leg clattered on the floor beside me.

I laid on the ground wheezing like a fat guy walking up his 5th flight of stairs when I heard Bryan’s lovely partner cry out to him:

“Hit him again, Bryan” shrieked the bimbo, “Kick him in the nuts!”

I gasped for breath and observed the chaos around me. Everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. Men and women were running out of the restaurant screaming, Psycho Jimmy was being rag-dolled by an invisible dog, one of his arms had been reduced to hamburger. One woman was walking casually out of the dining area and sampling foods from various plates as she walked by each table.

My eyes came to rest on Destiny who sat solemnly in her chair watching her beloved pet maul a man. Tears fell silently down her cheeks. As strange and morbid as the situation was, it was for her a final goodbye to her companion over the last several years. As far as we knew, once Hercules was done thoroughly thrashing the man who had stolen his body, he’d presumably ascend to Heaven in some sort of Rapture. If a dog can go there, that is – The Bible is pretty fuzzy on the subject. Maybe he’d go to Hell, he didn’t seem like the friendliest dog.

My gaze shifted again to the frat bro who towered over me. He was lifting his cheap imitation snake skin cowboy boot to stomp my lights out when an ear-splitting screech filled the dining room.

People throughout the restaurant clasped their hands tight over their ears, a few dropped to their knees in pain. Covering my ears didn’t seem to do much, the sound was sharp enough to penetrate straight through the bone of my cranium and reverberate around in my skull cavity knocking loose neural connections as it bounced back and forth.

I felt concussed, dizzy.

The screech turned into a chorus of screams as the floor directly in front of Psycho Jimmy began to crack and separate. Psycho Jimmy crab walked backwards away from the fissure as it widened to about the size of a manhole cover; heat and orange light began to pour forth from it. Suddenly arms, several of them, burst from the newly formed cavity. The arms were a patchwork of raw red skin, pustules of pussy white sores and deep black areas where they had been too heavily charred to even be recognized as human flesh. Swollen and shiny, the arms began to flail in circles, heatwaves seemed to rise from their angry hands as they grasped at the air around them.

The restaurant lights flickered and my old friend, Fear, began bubbling up inside of me once again. A palpable sense of dread weighed heavy on all of us left in the dining room. I was filled with a dizzying mix of disbelief, panic, and a primal instinct to flee from the hell-spawn emerging from the depths of hell before us.

I got the impression that frat boy Bryan was the type of person who could never pass up an opportunity to impress a girl. Generally, to these guys, this usually meant drinking a beer while wakeboarding, getting into fights with total strangers after a night at the bar, or being incredibly mean to waitresses and various other positions in the service industry. At that moment, I guess he thought closing a door to hell itself would earn him a few late-night snapchats, which it probably should have if he had any idea what he was doing.

Bryan, as if this was just another bar fight, casually walked towards the thrashing mass of charred hands without making direct eye contact with it. When he got within striking distance he attempted to throw a massive haymaker punch, it was almost as if he thought he could catch the monstrosity off guard.

One of the grotesque hands easily grabbed his wrist mid-punch and Bryan could hardly get out a pathetic, “Huh?” before the hand pulled him into the fiery crevasse.

His girlfriend erupted into shrieks.

Less than half a second after Bryan’s demise, another hand lashed out from the group and caught something invisible.

The hand had grasped Hercules by one of his back ankles as he was trying to make his way around the hole and over to Destiny and, for a brief moment, Hercules’ true form came into view. Hairless, slimy, with human hands at the end of each of its limbs and a single horn protruding from its forehead, Hercules definitely wasn’t a dog.

What the hell was Destiny up to? I couldn’t believe I’d been in close proximity with that thing for the past few days. I felt sick.

Just like Bryan before him, Hercules was pulled into the pit of fire and the restaurant descended into a brief second of silence as it closed behind him.

I lifted myself up off the floor and took one more swing at the glass display case that protected the guitar of Melissa Ethridge. It finally shattered.

Dropped the leg on the table in front of me and reached into the shattered display case and pulled out the guitar. I took a step back, cleared my throat and began to strum the guitar when –

WHACK!

A very heavy and very gaudy purse smacked me upside the head, “You Bastard!” Shouted the life-size Barbie girl Bryan had brought out on a date tonight, “You motherfucker!” she shouted again in unison with a second swing of the purse.

“Ma’am, please stop” I pleaded with her as I ducked under another swing of her unusually heavy purse, “I’m trying to destroy a haunted prosthetic leg with the power of song to save my intern from being trapped in a painting for all of eternity!”

Not only did she not stop, but she grabbed the prosthetic leg from the table next to us and started inspecting it, no doubt to judge its effectiveness as a weapon against me.

I took the opportunity to start playing, “Come to my Window” while slowly backing away from the angry woman.

After a few seconds of my sweet music-making, I watched the human leather on the leg begin to ripple in the woman’s hands. Any sane person on the planet would have dropped the leg at that point, but she didn’t.

Instead, the woman tilted her head back and screamed. Her mouth opened wider and wider until it reached a point when she physically could not possibly continue to expand her gaping maw. Then her jaw shifted slightly and there was a sudden POP! and her mouth continued to stretch wider.

Then the hands appeared, two hands appeared from out of the woman’s mouth and gripped the sides of her lips as if something was about to pull itself out of her mouth – and that is exactly what happened.

“I would dial the numbers, just to listen to your breath // I would stand inside my hell and hold the hand of death”

I started singing faster now, desperate to make this work.

An old woman’s head emerged from the mouth. She was old, dripping red with blood and I could see by the look in her face that she wasn’t just angry – she despised me. I could feel the hate radiating off of her. It was as if I could taste it in the air. She didn’t just want me dead, she wanted me annihilated.

The neck breached the mouth and in short order – the shoulders. The scene was quickly changing from one reminiscent of childbirth to one of a snake molting its skin.

“Come to my window // Crawl inside // Wait by the light of the moon”

This wasn’t working. I glanced around the room. Looking for an ally. Destiny was gone. Hercules was gone. Psycho Jimmy was pulling himself to his feet. He was looking at me with his crazy eyes. I couldn’t tell if he was under some sort of trance, but he wasn’t blinking, and he looked pissed. Then again, he always looked pissed. He started moving towards me.

I continued to sing, but panic was starting to rise within me. The song wasn’t exactly going as I'd hoped, there was a demon being born in front of me and Psycho Jimmy didn’t exactly look like he wanted to hold hands and sing Kumbaya.

I took a step backwards and found my back against a wall. I was cornered.

“Giving away promises….la la…na na na nahhh”

I realized at this point I didn’t even know all the words to this song. I quickly switched over to the first song that popped in my head. It was by The Ramones and it wasn’t even close to a beautiful song, but Melissa Ethridge wasn’t cutting it.

“The KKK took my baby away // They took her away // Away from me!”

The demon continued to pull itself out of its skin suit and revealed more of its true form:  Her upper body was a twisted, nightmarish version of an old woman. Shriveled, wrinkled, naked and dripping with blood. From the waist down, it was an enormous spider, its black, chitinous legs clicking against the wooden floor stepped on to the hardwood floor of the dining room. The spider's body was bloated and hairy, with glistening beady eyes that dotted the area where the woman’s abdomen met the spider’s face.

Psycho Jimmy was nearly within arm’s reach as well.

“Time for Plan B” I thought.

In a flash I swung the guitar over my head and smashed it across the face of the demon, sending shards of chipped wood flying across the room. I wanted to try and quickly throw a punch at Psycho Jimmy before he could react, but when I turned to face him, he was already on top of me.

Before I even knew what was happening Psycho Jimmy had grabbed both of my wrists, pressed me up against the wall and pinned my arms above my head. His grip was vice-like, even with one of his arms being torn to shreds. For the first time I saw him smile. His crusty lips parted to reveal a row of cracked, yellowed teeth.

I was about to try a kick, when Psycho Jimmy leaned in quickly and kissed me on the mouth.

What the hell was going on?????????/

Psycho Jimmy pulled back from the smooch, looked me dead in the eyes and said in a surprisingly gentle voice, “I didn’t believe in love at first sight until I laid eyes on you. I just didn’t know how to say it.”

I glanced over to the monster standing a few feet away and it seemed to be physically pained by what it was witnessing.

An act of True Love! This was it!

“Oh Jimmy, I feel the same way,” I whispered back to the crazy and most likely homeless man who had just kissed me. It was difficult to pull my eyes away from the literal demon next to us, but I had to make eye contact with Psycho Jimmy to make the moment work.

“Call me Psycho” he said, moving in for another kiss.

In that moment I fought the most difficult internal battle of my life – Do I kiss him back?

I took one last look at the demon – it was now writhing on the ground in pain, I could hear it whimpering.

“I cannot believe I have to do this,” was my only thought.

I closed my eyes and kissed PJ back. A large slimy tongue that tasted like cigarettes slipped into my mouth, I tried to hold back a gag – and then I heard shouting.

I opened my eyes just in time to see a police officer full-body tackle Psycho off of me. Two more officers followed close behind to kneel on Psycho’s back as they cuffed him. I scanned the room looking for evidence of the demon spider woman.

All I could find was the prosthetic leg. It was covered in hard plastic. The human leather that had been used to bind it was gone.

There was no other evidence of what happened. No demon, no manhole to hell. Just a totally destroyed restaurant dining room. Imagine if Lord of the Flies took place in an Applebee’s. That’s what it looked like. 

A police officer escorted me out of the building asking me if I wanted to press charges on the man who assaulted me. I could hear Psycho shouting at me, “Wait for me! No jail can hold me! I’ll come find you!” 

I would need to put my house up for rent immediately.

I got in my car and drove home; I called Destiny on the way but she didn’t answer. There was something about her that she was hiding from me, I decided it’d probably be best for me to never find out.

I pulled my car into the garage and was about to head inside, when a loud banging rattled my trunk door.

I pulled out my keys and popped the truck door and my car birthed Pedro onto my garage floor. He was sweaty and breathing heavily. A blank canvas lay in the trunk he just emerged from. 

“Holy shit, Boss!” he said between breaths, “That was wild, bro! What are we going to do next?”

I paused for a moment to evaluate not only what had just happened in the last week, but my entire life, then I told him, “You’re fired, Pedro” and then, “I need to get a real job.”
