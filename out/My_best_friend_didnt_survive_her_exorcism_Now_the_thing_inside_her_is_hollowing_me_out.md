Clara and I used to wait for it.

She said the silence was a kind of sacrament, that if you listened long enough you could hear the earth itself bleeding. She wasn’t wrong. The longer we sat, the more it seemed to thicken in the air, carrying with it the copper-stink of blood.

Sometimes we saw things moving along the tree line. Not animals - never animals. These were taller, wrong in their proportions, bending at the joints like marionettes with tangled strings. Their mouths hung slack, tongues black and swollen, and their teeth shone wet like broken glass. I remember once the silence deepened so suddenly I felt dizzy, and when I blinked I saw one of them closer - close enough to see that its throat was slit wide open, and yet it kept trying to moan. Clara just smiled at it, lips stained red from where her gums had started bleeding.

She called them *the choir*.

Her body began to change in those weeks. She’d wake up with blood soaking through her shirt, not from her nose or her mouth but from tiny, perfect holes along her ribs - as though something had bitten her over and over while she slept. She showed me one evening, lifting the fabric, and I swear the wounds pulsed faintly, weeping in rhythm, as if they were small mouths breathing under her skin.

“You don’t understand,” she whispered to me once, eyes hollow, voice raw. “It’s not hurting me. It’s hollowing me out so I can hold it.”

I begged her to see a doctor. She laughed until blood dribbled from the corner of her mouth.

On the last night before they locked me out of the house, we sat together by the road. The silence was so heavy it felt like a cathedral had collapsed over us. I could barely breathe, but Clara seemed stronger, straighter. Her humming was louder than it had ever been, and the figures along the trees leaned in as if they were listening. I tried not to look at them, but I couldn’t stop. Their faces were nothing but gashes - open, leaking, gnawing at the air like starving things.

Clara gripped my wrist so tight her nails drew blood. Her eyes were black all the way through now, and when she smiled, her teeth had grown long and thin, like needles slick with meat.

“Don’t watch me die,” she said. But it didn’t sound like her. It sounded like something already inside her, promising it wasn’t death she was headed toward but something worse, something that would make death look merciful.

That was the last time I saw her alive.

They started at sundown.

Her parents didn’t want me there, but I couldn’t leave. I stood by the window, forehead pressed against the cold glass, watching candlelight bend against the curtains. I could hear the priest’s voice, low and trembling, climbing into chants. The first hour was only prayers, but even then the house began to moan - timbers straining, plaster cracking in thin lines down the wall like veins bursting open.

Then Clara screamed.

It wasn’t her voice. It was a rupture, a splitting howl that rattled my jaw and filled my throat with the taste of blood. When it stopped, I realized I was bleeding from my gums.

The curtains fluttered though the windows were shut tight. Shadows swam across the ceiling in shapes that didn’t match any body inside. Something heavy slammed against the wall so hard the glass beside me shook, and I saw her mother stumble back with a hand over her face, red pouring between her fingers.

The priest kept shouting, but his voice was shaking apart. The words came out raw, breaking, like he was coughing shards of glass. And then Clara laughed. Loud, wet, hysterical. It didn’t stop even when it turned into choking. I saw her body thrash in the candlelight, her hair whipping as if pulled by invisible fists. She spat, and I swear the spray hit the far wall - dark and thick, a spray of red that painted the crucifix above the door.

The smell turned unbearable. Copper and bile and something sour, like rotting fruit. The priest staggered forward, pressing the cross to her chest, and that’s when she began tearing at herself.

I swear on my life - I saw her nails dig into her stomach, ripping skin in long, jagged strips. The blood ran too freely, more than a body should hold, puddling fast, soaking the floor. She laughed through it, shrieking in two voices, hers and something deeper, layered beneath like an echo in a cavern.

The figures came back then. I saw them in the corners of the room, crowding close to her chair: long black shapes with slashed mouths and eyes like pits, their limbs twitching in time with her thrashing. Nobody else seemed to see them. They stood there like witnesses at a baptism.

And then, suddenly, it ended.

Her body went still. Her head tilted back, eyes rolled white, and the laugh died in her throat like something cut it out mid-breath. The silence fell so thick it choked me. For a moment, I thought they had done it, that they had dragged whatever lived in her out into the dark.

But then her chest opened.

Not split, not cut - *opened* like something inside had been clawing for release and finally burst through. The sound it made was wet, gurgling, obscene. Blood sprayed across the priest’s vestments. He dropped the cross. Her mother fainted. Her father fell to his knees, sobbing.

And in that ruin of her body, just for a second, I saw something look out.

Not Clara. Not human. A face made of torn flesh and teeth, smiling, drinking in the horror like wine. And then it was gone.

They carried her out hours later in a black bag. No one met my eyes. No one said a word.

Her mother called me the next morning. She didn’t say Clara died. She said, in a voice scraped raw, that she “did not survive the deliverance.”

But I know better.

I think what I saw wasn’t leaving her. It was being *born*.

It hasn’t left me alone.

Since the night of the exorcism, I can’t close my eyes without seeing her. Not Clara as I knew her, not the girl who used to hum hymns on the roadside. What I see now is her face split wide, black veins crawling out of her skin like roots, her mouth a gash that never stops bleeding. She stands at the foot of my bed and hums, but the sound doesn’t come from her throat anymore - it comes from somewhere deeper, like it’s rattling through her ribs, a sound too big for her frame.

I keep waking up with blood in my mouth. At first I thought I was biting my tongue in my sleep, but last night I spit into the sink and a tooth clinked against the porcelain. My gums are raw, torn open as if something’s feeding there.

The silence I told you about before? It’s not just outside anymore. It’s in me. I feel it sitting heavy in my chest, pumping with my blood. Sometimes it grows so loud I can’t hear anything else, just that deep, gory stillness pressing against my skull.

I went back to her house tonight. I shouldn’t have. Her parents are gone now, moved out, left everything behind. The windows are broken, the doors wide open. The whole place reeks like copper and rot. Her chair is still there, the one she was strapped into when she tore herself open. The wood is black with dried blood. The crucifix above the door is bent, twisted like it was wrenched by enormous hands.

I swear I heard her humming in the walls. Not faintly. Not like a memory. Loud. Wet. As if the house itself was vibrating with her voice.

And then I saw them.

The same figures that used to gather in the tree line - gaunt, blood-slick things with their jaws unhinged. They filled the living room. Packed into the corners, pressed against the ceiling, crouched on all fours with their tongues dragging across the floorboards. Their eyes were wet holes. And every one of them was humming *her tune.*

I ran.

But the silence followed me home.

It’s in my house now. The figures crowd the edge of my vision when the lights go out. The walls groan. My bed vibrates like it’s breathing. And when I finally fall asleep, I wake up drenched, my skin sticky with blood that isn’t mine.

I don’t know how long I have. I don’t think this is about Clara anymore. She wasn’t the end of it - she was the beginning. The *choir* she talked about has taken root, and I think I’m next.

My gums are still bleeding. My skin feels thinner every hour, like it’s stretching to make room for something beneath. And sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I catch a face staring out through mine. Not Clara. Not me. Something smiling, hungry, waiting for the silence to finish its work.

If I stop posting, it’s because it’s done hollowing me out.

And when that happens… I don’t think I’ll be alone anymore.
