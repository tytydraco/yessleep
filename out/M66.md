It was Friday, almost six. I wasn’t quite myself—more like a drained body walking on autopilot. The week had been endless: classes, exams, meetings... My body was barely functioning as I dragged it across the city. My feet searched for the station like the pavement itself was leeching the last bits of energy out of me.

I had my headphones on, listening to a podcast I don’t even remember now. It was just noise, the kind you use to drown out other, louder, internal noises. I pushed through the swarm of people gathering at the station—an ant-like mass moving back and forth, every face dulled by routine. I was just another ant.

A bus arrived, let passengers off, and left. Then another, the F26, same story. Neither was mine. I stepped closer to the platform’s edge, waiting for my route: the M66. Almost here.

While waiting, I did what I always do: avoided standing too close to any man. Call it instinct, trauma, experience. Whatever it is, it’s always there. And then I saw it: my bus. The M66. As always, completely empty—it was the first stop on its route. I tensed up like a spring. Clutched my bag. My body knew what to do: get on, find a seat, survive.

I lunged. Literally. As if the bus were the last lifeboat in the middle of a shipwreck. I accidentally shoved a lady. Mumbled an apology mid-jump without turning back. I climbed in, sat down near the driver—not right next to him, of course, across the aisle. I settled in. Breathed. Put my headphones back on. The sky looked like a painting—blue, pink, amber, streaked with gray buildings. The sunset was speaking a beauty that didn’t belong to concrete. I texted my mom. I hadn’t been able to reply earlier. I wanted to tell her I was fine, heading home. Even though... I wasn’t entirely fine.

Fatigue covered me like a heavy blanket. I tried to resist it, like always—sleeping on the bus isn’t safe. But this time… it won.

Blackness.

Silence.

A jolt. The bus braked hard. I opened my eyes like surfacing from deep water. Blinked, trying to orient myself. The station… which one was it? Second stop. I sat up slightly, still groggy. Something felt... off.

I was alone.

Completely alone.

Just the driver up front, stiff and motionless like a statue. And me. Just the two of us.

That wasn’t normal. Not at that hour. Not on this route. And I knew it—I felt it in my bones. It made no sense. I rubbed my eyes. Looked around. Nothing. Outside, the station was packed with people. But no one was getting on. As if the bus… wasn’t there.

I swallowed hard.

Took off my headphones. The silence got even worse.

The doors closed. We continued moving. I pressed my face against the window, searching for a sign, a clue, anything. Everything looked functional. The screen on the bus showed the next stops, the destination, the time: **6:11**.

Third stop. The doors opened. No one got off. No one got on.

Cold crawled down my back like an insect on my spine. I stood up. My legs trembled. I walked through the bus to the next car. Nothing. Not a voice. Not a forgotten shopping bag. Not even a scrap of paper. The bus was pristine, new, spotless… like it had never been used.

I started thinking maybe I was dreaming.

Maybe I’d fallen asleep at the station and all this was part of a dream. Maybe. But then… why could I feel the floor so solid beneath my feet? Why was the cold so real? Why did my neck ache from the seat I’d napped on?

Fourth stop.

I sat directly in front of the door. I needed someone. Anyone. Someone to look at me. To *see* me. A boy appeared. Red sneakers. Looking at his phone.

I waved. Shouted silently.

“Hey!”

He looked up. My heart jumped.

But… he didn’t see me. He looked *through* me. As if I were made of smoke.

“Red sneakers! Look at me!”

He frowned. Looked around. Behind him. Ahead. Confused. As if he felt *something* was off.

But never saw me.

And that’s when I knew.

That’s when I *knew* this wasn’t a dream. Because in dreams, you *know* they’re dreams. Because in dreams, you don’t feel the exact sting of cold on your cheek, or the clammy sweat in your palms. In dreams, you don’t notice tiny things like the seat’s rough upholstery or the electric buzz of the lights. This was too **sharp** to be a dream.

And yet… it couldn’t be real.

I walked through the entire bus again. Car after car. The stations passed. Doors opened. Closed. No one.

And then, at the very back of the second car, something changed. A reflection. In the bus’s dark window, I saw myself—or rather, a version of myself. Same face, yes. But paler. Eyes sunken. Like I hadn’t slept in days. Like I had aged a week in an hour.

I froze.

Touched my face. The reflection did the same—but half a second late. A subtle delay. Like it was mimicking me.

I went back to my seat. My stop was coming up.

I put my headphones back on, but played nothing. I didn’t want any sound. Just wanted to get out.

The bus stopped. The doors opened. I whispered:

“Thank you…”

The driver didn’t move.

I stepped out.

And then… the shock. **I felt the bodies**. The people. Someone bumped into me. Another apologized. A woman grumbled. I was back. Part of the world again.

I turned to look at the bus.

The M66.

Still there.

But no one noticed it.

As if it didn’t exist.

And even now, writing this, I wonder: who brought me home that night? What *was* that bus? What version of me sat in those empty seats?

That day, I entered a place you don’t walk into by choice.

And I only got out… because *something* let me out.
