Man, I need to get this off my chest because I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do anymore. Someone has been standing at my door for days, and things are getting weirder by the moment. It sounds like a lie, but it’s real. It started on a Friday night. I was chilling on the couch, playing video games, just the usual stay-at-home routine for someone who’d rather stay in than go out drinking at a bar.

Then, out of nowhere, I decided to look at the door. You know when you’re distracted and suddenly something makes you focus on something else? That’s what happened. I lived in an apartment building, and on my floor, there were three other apartments. Everyone seemed like decent people. It was 10 p.m. when I decided to look at the door and noticed there was a gap underneath it, big enough to see the hallway light and if anyone was out there.

That’s when I started to get chills down my spine. I saw the hallway light turn on, and someone got off the elevator. So far, nothing unusual. But this person walked toward my door, slowly, and stopped there. Just standing still. I froze. Did they get the wrong floor? The light went off, and everything was silent. When the light came back on, the person was still there. My heart started racing. Was it a neighbor needing help?

I felt like I should open the door, but at the same time, something told me not to. Finally, I mustered the courage, got up, and went to the peephole. I looked and only saw darkness because the hallway light had gone off again. I decided to open the door, and as I did, the light turned on. But there was no one there. I closed the door, locked it, and bolted it. I started wondering if the thing at my door had entered my apartment. Or worse, what if it had been there all along, and I just hadn’t noticed?

On Saturday, I tried to go about my routine, but the weird feeling from the night before wouldn’t go away. Everything felt out of place, and every little noise made me jump. Night came, and I went back to the couch, keeping an eye on the door. It was almost 10 p.m. when I heard the elevator open again. The hallway light came on, and just like before, the shadow was there, standing at my door.

This time, I didn’t even bother looking through the peephole. I just stayed there, my heart racing, knowing there was nothing I could do. Each night it was the same: that shadow would come back at 10 p.m. and stay there, like it was waiting for something. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t leave the house; I was completely consumed by fear.

Then, one night, everything changed again. The elevator didn’t make a sound, and the hallway light didn’t come on. The hallway was in complete darkness. I waited, trying to figure out what was happening. Then, I heard a low sound, like someone moving inside my apartment. Panic set in. That thing had gotten in.

I looked around but didn’t see anything. The feeling that someone was watching me just kept growing. My heart was pounding. And then, I heard a low, whispering voice: “Why don’t you open the door?” I could barely move. I didn’t know if the voice was in my head or coming from the walls. “Open the door,” the voice repeated, with an unsettling calmness.

I spent the rest of the night curled up on the couch, too scared to move, as the darkness seemed to close in. When the sun finally came up, I just wanted it all to be over. But deep down, I knew the thing was still there. It’s waiting. And one day, I’m going to have to open the door.

Should I open the door?
