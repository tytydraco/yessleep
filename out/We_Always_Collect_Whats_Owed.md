The scent hooked me before I even saw the booth rich cinnamon and cloves, warm and earthy, but edged with something sharp and coppery. The farmers market buzzed around me: laughter, bright tents, kids weaving between ankles, bees circling lemonade jugs. I rubbed my tired eyes and sipped my second overpriced cold brew, still barely upright. That’s when I saw it.

Tucked between two booths stood a crooked wooden table. A hand painted banner stretched across the front, reading in deep red:
“Free Samples – Taste the Best Sleep of Your Life.”

The vendor was strange. Wire-rimmed glasses. A wool vest, despite the heat. And his smile, God that smile, was broad and unnatural, like it had been carved there. A velvet tray sat before him, holding dark square cubes. They looked like chocolate, but something about them felt off. They were arranged like tiny pillows waiting to be slept on.

I hadn’t gotten more than a few hours of sleep in days. My eyelids felt like they were dragging stones. I hovered near the booth, drawn in despite myself.

“Free?” I asked.

He nodded. “No cost. Just a taste.”

He held the tray out. His teeth gleamed too bright, too sharp like a predator that had learned to mimic a man. The cube melted on my tongue, warm and bittersweet, like fudge laced with chamomile. I blinked and he was already talking to someone else. I turned to leave, but I heard him whisper behind me, low and chilling:

“We always collect what’s owed.”

I froze. Spun back around. He was smiling at a new customer like nothing happened. I walked faster, trying to shake the feeling. But those words clung to me like static.

That night, I slept like the dead. No dreams, no tossing, no 3 a.m. panic. Just velvet-black stillness. And I should’ve felt grateful but the next morning, I felt watched. That crawling sensation behind the eyes.

When I stepped out of my apartment, I nearly screamed. He was standing by my car. No table, no tray. Just him.

“I need to talk with you,” I said, pulse pounding.

“Good sleep, wasn’t it?” he asked.

“It was. What was in that candy?”

He tilted his head. “We don’t deal in ingredients. We deal in exchange.”

“Exchange?” I asked, stomach flipping.

“You’ve already tasted. Now it’s time to give what’s owed.”

Before I could scream, his hands clamped onto my temples. They smelled like rot and mold. It didn’t hurt at first but then my skull burned. Warmth oozed from my ears, slow and sticky, like my memories were leaking out. My head throbbed. My knees gave out.

Then came the emptiness.

I couldn’t remember my grandmother’s funeral. Then her voice. Then… her name.

“What are you doing to me?” I sobbed, stumbling back.

Nobody noticed. People passed like I wasn’t even there. The world around me dulled muffled, colorless, drained.

“Just a piece,” he said. “The first night is free. But it always costs something.”

“Please,” I whispered. “Give them back.”

He smiled. “Sleep is sacred. We don’t do refunds. But I’ll be back. One more night… and the rest is mine.”

I didn’t go home. I drove for hours with the windows down and music blaring. I watched the sunrise from a gas station parking lot, chugging energy drinks until I felt sick.

The next day, I found this spiritual shop on the edge of town. An old woman read my palm until she flinched and yanked her hand away.

“You’re hollowing,” she said. “Something’s feeding on you.”

“I just need to stay awake,” I told her. “If I don’t sleep, it can’t take anything else.”

But the body always gives in.

I taped thumbtacks to my ribs. Set alarms every ten minutes, each one labeled:
STAY AWAKE. DON’T DREAM.

I cranked the speaker to full volume. Slapped myself every time my eyes fluttered. Still, I woke up.

The tacks were scattered. The tape peeled off. My speaker was silent. My phone dead. And my mind?

It felt like someone else’s.

I couldn’t remember high school. Or the sound of my mother’s laugh. Or my father’s favorite song. My name slipped away when I tried to say it.

Another velvet cube was waiting on my nightstand.

I didn’t sleep for three more days. I drank caffeine until my hands trembled. Screamed at mirrors. Begged anything out there to spare what was left of me.

Eventually, I collapsed.

When my eyes opened, I wasn’t me anymore. I didn’t cry. I didn’t shake. I didn’t run.

I stood still.

I didn’t answer calls. Didn’t show up to work. My landlord eventually filed a report.

The apartment was just as I’d left it: quiet, calm, and watched over by a velvet tray on the nightstand. One final cube, untouched.

But I didn’t eat it.

I didn’t need to.

⸻

Sometimes, I wonder how I even remember any of this. Pieces come and go like faces in fog. I try to hold onto them, but they slip through, just impressions now. I think I wrote this down to remember, or maybe to warn myself. Or maybe… it’s not me writing anymore. Just whatever’s left.

The farmers market reopened that weekend. The crooked table returned, this time nestled between a popcorn stand and a flower cart. The banner fluttered in the breeze:

“Free Samples – Taste the Best Sleep of Your Life.”

The vendor wore a wool vest despite the heat.

My smile was wide and practiced.

A tired teenager wandered by, earbuds in, rubbing his eyes. He paused at the cubes.

I offered the tray.

“Go on,” I said. “It’s free.”
