He died a little over a year ago when a blood clot made its way from his leg up to his heart. I was working overseas in the military at the time, but I was still able to make it to his funeral. My dad was a very loved man by more than just our family, and I can’t even count the number of times I said “thank you for coming” or “yeah it doesn’t even feel real.” The thing is, it really didn’t. It still doesn’t. 

I remember getting the call from my mom when it happened, and even the way she broke the news to me made me feel like she didn’t even think it actually happened. She just spoke to me in the same tone she uses when we call to talk about our days. Having been overseas for about two years at this point, I usually tried to call her or my dad at least once a week if I could, but I found it to be easier to call my mom because she had a more consistent schedule. It’s not that I didn’t want to talk to my dad, I just didn’t know when I’d be able to, so I’d usually just settle with a text from time to time. Hell, the last time I spoke to him over the phone was on father’s day, but the conversation slowly went from “happy father’s day” to him complaining about how much he works.

“It just feels like I never have free time anymore”

“Yeah, I feel that” 

I really didn’t. Ever since I joined, I had more free time on my hands than I knew what to do with, but up until then I was in the same boat. I’ve been working since I was 13, and played sports in college while also having a job to pay tuition, and even after college I worked 2 jobs just to pay bills. That’s part of the reason why I joined, but now it almost made me feel guilty knowing that I had all this free time while he had to continue working 2 jobs into his mid-50s just to hope for a retirement.

“When are you coming home?”

“I’m hoping in September if things go well on my end.”

“That’ll be nice. I’m proud of you son. I miss you. Gotta go, this order’s finally ready. Love you.”

“Love you too dad.”

Those were the last words we ever said to each other. At least, while he was alive.

The night before he died, I called my mom to check in and see how she was doing and get my weekly update on what’s going on back home.

“Your dad tripped up the stairs on his way in last night. They just got done redoing the porch and one of the steps is a little taller than the other ones, and he isn’t quite used to it yet. He’s been sleeping on the chair in the living room because it hurts too much for him to go upstairs. You should call him, I’m sure he’d love to hear from you.”

“I’ll call him tomorrow, I’m getting ready to go out to a friend’s house for a little get-together.”

“Okay, be safe. Love you.”

“I will. Love you too.”

The next morning I was in the gym when I got a text from my mom saying, “Are you busy?”

This is code for “can I call you” which is normally fine, but it was only 6am where she is, and I usually don’t call her until later at night because of the time difference.

I told her I was busy, but I’d call her in a little bit. I’m not sure if it was divine intervention or what, but after I was done warming up, every machine that I wanted to use was taken, so I gave her a call back to see what was going on. Like I said before, the way she was talking to me made it seem like he took a trip to the hospital and she was on her way to pick him up to go home, but that wasn’t the case at all.

“But I’m coming home in September” I said, trying to hide the shakiness in my voice.

“I know, I’m sorry. We were really looking forward to seeing you too.”

The next several minutes were spent by me bawling my eyes out on the floor of the warmup room in the gym. Thankfully, only one other person was there to see it.

After regaining my composure, I made some phone calls and got on a plane to come home 3 months early. Luckily, being in the military allowed me to get a last minute plane ticket for free due to my circumstances, which I’m forever grateful for.

It was weird though. The whole time I was home, I felt like I was playing pretend. Like I was acting the part of a kid who lost his dad way before he expected to. I was sad, yes, but even when I was at his funeral I never actually cried or really showed any emotion. I just stood there while countless people came in and told me they were sorry for my loss or told me their favorite memories of him.

The following week was spent by me going out and catching up with old friends that I hadn’t seen since I left, and they all said the same things I had already heard hundreds of times, which just added to me feeling like I should feel worse about the whole thing.

When my time was up, I flew back to Europe and went back to work and it was almost like it never even happened. A few months went by and I wound up back in the states for a class, and that’s when they started.

Now, I’ve had problems with sleeping my whole life. I dealt with night terrors fairly consistently, with the occasional sleep paralysis episode, but I’d never talk in my sleep or sleepwalk. I wouldn’t even remember most of my dreams after a few hours usually.

The first time I saw him, I was standing in the middle of a store picking up snacks for work when he walked through the front door, walked up to me, hugged me and said “It’ll be alright son. I love you and I miss you.”

The timing on it was insane, because I had just recently gotten ghosted by “the one” and I was starting to spiral. I just woke up in tears but I actually felt like he hugged me and I genuinely felt comforted.

Anyway, the next one I remember was a couple weeks later. I was sitting in my living room, talking to my mom about something she heard on the news and asked if I knew anything about it. I told her no and even if I did, I wouldn’t be able to talk about it. Then, out of nowhere, my dad walked in the front door and just sat down in the chair beside me.

“D-dad..?”

“Hey son, how’ve you been?”

“Aren’t you.. Didn’t you.. How are you here?”

“Oh, they found this new procedure that brought me back to life. Pretty cool huh”

“Yeah, but are you actually-”

“Here? Yes.” 

He loved finishing my sentences, but I found it annoying.

We ended up talking about how work was going, what I’ve been up to and how I had been feeling for the past few months. I told him work was okay, told him about my new gym routine and that I missed him.

“It’s okay son, I’m still here.” and he got up and hugged me and I once again woke up in tears, this time hugging a pillow.

Like I said, I usually don’t sleep talk, and whenever I do communicate in my dreams, it feels the same as when I try punching someone in a dream - like I’m in a straight jacket and have zero arm strength. I don’t even usually hear what other people say, I just understand them because it’s a dream or whatever. But this conversation I had with my dad felt the exact same as if he and I were actually talking to each other. We both made clear, coherent sentences. I could see the different expressions on his face and he was even wearing the same Cubs hat he always wore to cover up his bald spot. It was by far the most realistic dream I had ever had, which is what made me so confused when I woke up.

A few more weeks passed, and during that time I was hoping he’d appear in my dreams again, but he never did. Eventually I forgot about it ever happening, and that’s when he showed up again.

But this time it was different.

My dad and I used to work at the same restaurant when I was in school and that’s where we were. It was a typical busy night which meant that he was in an irritable mood as the orders just kept coming back one after another, seemingly endlessly. I had just started working as a prep cook, and he was the main cook which meant he needed me to make sure the plates were ready to go by the time the food was ready so he could get it out to the customers, but I was falling behind.

“SkittleSac, hurry the fuck up!”

This caught me off guard because he didn’t ever talk to me like that. Not even when he was really pissed off.

“I’m trying dad”

“Well fuckin try harder. You’re holding up the line.”

and then, when I went to move a plate from one counter to another, we ran into each other and I dropped the plate on his foot.

“AH, WHAT THE FUCK”

And he threw a right hook so hard I woke up jumping out of my bed, followed by tears.

That was probably one of the scariest dreams I’ve ever had. Not because some monster was chasing me with a knife or a demon was squatting in the corner of my room while I couldn’t move, but because everything about that dream felt real. The restaurant was laid out the exact same way as I remembered, even down to the plates and how I arranged the topping bins. My dad was in his typical work attire and even some of my old co-workers were there as well. I could smell the food and hear the sound of fried food gurgling in oil and burgers sizzling on the grill. It was like I was actually there, but I have never had an interaction with my dad like that. Sure, sometimes when it was busy he’d start cussing up a storm “damn this, and fuck that” but it never got violent, let alone against me. I was usually the one to calm him down and he told me several times that if I wasn’t there, he wasn’t sure how he would’ve gotten through the night, even if I was the one holding us up while I learned the new position.

I actually stayed up in bed the next night wondering if I was just digging up some repressed memories or feelings, but I couldn’t think of anything, and when I finally fell asleep, I just had another regular, forgettable dream. Once again, I eventually chalked it up to not being a big deal and moved on from that night.

Then about a month later, I had another dream.

Living in Europe has it’s perks. While I don’t like how far away from home I am, I do understand and appreciate the opportunity I’ve been given to go places and see things that many people only wish they’d be able to see and do.

I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights, and I was planning a trip to be able to see them since this year was supposed to have the perfect solar conditions to do so. I was up in the Arctic Circle, traveling alone since I couldn’t convince any of my friends to go with me. It was absolutely incredible. I grew up in the midwest, so I was fascinated by the vast mountain ranges and the beautiful blue lakes that looked like mirrors reflecting the small villages and boats that were sailing across them.

I was on an overnight excursion with a small group that were mostly couples with a few other solo travelers. We got pulled on sleds by reindeer and spent the night telling stories by a fire while one of our guides taught us how to throw a lasso at a pair of practice antlers. Eventually it got dark enough for us to start seeing the lights and everyone started taking out their phones to take pictures and after a while we all got in our tents to go to bed. As per usual, I didn’t fall asleep right away so I just laid in bed looking at the pictures I took when I started hearing some rustling outside. I figured it was one of the other travelers and continued swiping through my phone when I heard footsteps approaching my tent and then stopping. My heart started racing as I’m usually pretty anxious anyway, but eventually I heard the footsteps walk away and I started to calm down. Our tents had windows on the side that were covered by flaps, so I walked across the tent to see what was going on, thinking maybe the lights came back and people were gathering outside again.

When I opened the flap to my window, my dad was staring right back at me, smiling quite literally from ear to ear. "WHAT THE FUCK," I screamed, and stumbled back, tripping over some logs that were used for the furnace in the middle of the room. When I reached back to catch myself, my hand landed on the lit furnace, scorching my hand and making me scream again. While I was on the ground writhing in pain, my dad walked into my tent and grabbed me by the legs and started dragging me out of the tent.

“You really wanted to see the Northern Lights didn’t you? You didn’t think I’d want to see them too?”

When he got me outside, there was a sled attached to a reindeer and he reached into a bag, took out a rope and began tying my legs to the back of the sled. I tried resisting, but I couldn’t move, and the freezing ground and late winter air kept me paralyzed while he got onto the sled and yelled for the reindeer to start moving. Before I knew it, I was being dragged across a field of snow while my dad was cackling from his perch, occasionally twisting his head around to look at me, screaming, “DO YOU SEE THEM?! DO YOU SEE THE LIGHTS?! AREN’T THEY BEAUTIFUL?!” My back was searing with each rock and stick that passed under it and eventually I blacked out from the pain.

When I woke up, I shot straight out of my bed, my hand burning with the tingling sensation you get when the blood starts rushing back after laying on it for too long, and my back was sore, probably from the lack of support from the hides and wood panels they called a bed, and I was freezing since the furnace that was supposed to keep me warm ran out of wood probably hours ago.

I laid back down for a while, confused about what I just experienced and scared to open the door to join the others for breakfast. Eventually I did, and when I joined them, I must have looked rough because they all looked at me with a concerned expression on their faces.

Needless to say, that shook me up for quite awhile. I found it hard to sleep for the next few nights and even when I got back to my apartment a few days later, I still didn’t feel comfortable with falling asleep. I live by myself and I don’t really know who to talk to about stuff like this because I’ve never really dealt with anything like it before.

I called my mom when I got back to tell her how the trip went, but I completely left out the part about my dad showing up in another dream. I asked her if she had any dreams about him since he died and she said she has, but when I told her about the first couple I had, she said hers weren’t like that, that it was usually just like her other dreams where he’d make an appearance but that was it. She said I was lucky to still be able to connect with him in some way, but she only knew about the good dreams, not the ones I was having lately.

He left me alone for the next couple months. I found out that if I have a couple drinks before I went to bed, I usually wouldn’t have any dreams, let alone any with him in it. I don’t drink by myself because I had some family members that had drinking problems and I didn’t want to end up like them, but I realized that on the nights I went out to the bars with my friends, I was able to fall asleep faster and I wouldn’t have any dreams. Eventually this led to me coming home with a six pack of Bud as a little night cap, and for awhile it worked.

I’m a pretty big dude, over 6’ (180 cm for my metric readers), so eventually sixers weren’t doing it for me anymore. One night I fell asleep and had a dream about work, and when I woke up I was so scared by what used to be a normal dream that I knew I had to up the dosage a bit. I came home from work that night with a 12 pack, but only got through about 8 before I started getting tired. At some point 8 started turning into 10 and 10 to 12 before I decided to switch to 30 packs just to play it safe.

Nobody at work has been able to tell, thankfully. If they could, I probably wouldn’t have my job for much longer. I didn’t talk about it either, because I knew nobody would understand.

But then, one night about a week ago, I had another dream.

It was a Thursday night and I had just gotten done cleaning up my apartment when I decided it was time to start getting ready for bed. I was already tired, but out of fear of falling asleep sober, I cracked open a beer and threw a show up on my TV to pass the time.

It was starting to get late, and the stack of cans was starting to pile up, but I caught myself starting to doze off a little, so I slammed a couple more beers and called it a night. I got done brushing my teeth, flipped off all the lights in the living room and turned on my phone’s flashlight. As soon as I did, I heard a roar come from my kitchen directly behind me which made me jump out of my skin and when I turned around, there he was. 

My dad was standing in the kitchen with his head almost touching the ceiling and when I looked at his black eyes all he said was, “Why didn’t you call?”

I immediately ran out of my apartment into the stairwell and when I turned to go down the first flight of stairs, he was already standing at the bottom looking up at me.

“You said you would call.”

“I was!” I screamed, my voice cracking out of fear.

“You weren’t gonna call. You never did.”

“I was supposed to see you when I got home in September” I pleaded

“LIAR!” He roared as he started chasing me back up the stairs, shaking the ground with each step

I ran back into my apartment and slammed the door behind me, but he was waiting for me once again in my living room.

“You never called!” He screamed again “NOT EVEN WHEN I WAS DYING!”

“I was asleep, I had no idea” tears and snot falling down my face.

“Asleep?! You were ASLEEP?!!” and he charged at me once again

Not knowing where to go now, I ran out onto my balcony. I live on the third floor of an apartment building, but there were bushes below me so I took my chances and leapt down, just to try and get away from him.

I must have broken something and passed out from the fall because I woke up to the feeling of someone grabbing my leg, which made me kick and scream. When I opened my eyes, two police officers were looking back at me. I was in my front lawn, in my underwear. The sun was out. It was morning.

Apparently, one of my neighbors heard all of the commotion the night before and when they saw me laying outside on their way to work, they called the police to make sure I was okay. I apologized to the officer that I kicked and told him that I just had a bad dream. He asked me if I knew what day it was and if I knew my name, and when I gave him the correct answers he offered to escort me back up to my apartment and asked if I needed any medical attention. I told him no and that I appreciated his help, but that I was fine and just needed to get ready for work since my shift started in a few hours. Thankfully the door to my apartment was still open, so I didn’t need to get my landlord involved to give me a spare key, and when I left for work, I was followed by a squad car up until the final turn to get on base.

That day, I put in leave for the next two weeks to try and get my mind right, which luckily got approved before I went home for the day. I made my usual stop at the gas station on the way home and picked up another 30 pack and this time, grabbed a bottle of Jack to go with it.

I’m not sure what’s gonna happen now. It’s been about 36 hours since the last time I slept, I think.
