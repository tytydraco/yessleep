I've been staring at this screen for three hours now, trying to figure out how to start this report. My supervisor wants it done in forty-eight hours, which is insane considering what I'm dealing with. But here goes nothing.

My name is Dr. Verin, and I work in the Collections Division. Of what organization you might ask? Don't ask. I have a PhD in Neurology, which apparently qualified me for this nightmare assignment: investigating the connection between magnesium supplements and what we're calling "oneiric events." Dream stuff. Weird dream stuff.

I wish I had more time to organize this properly, but they want speed over structure. So I'm just going to tell you what I found, case by case.

Ryan was thirty-four, a chemist. We didn't find out about him until after he died. His wife told us he'd been taking magnesium glycinate for sleep issues related to work stress. Normal things.

What wasn't standard were his notes. Part lab journal, part diary. He wrote about dreams of some kind of library in a massive city. He claimed he got a formula there, a skin cream recipe. Not from his own research, from the dream.

I know how that sounds. But here's the thing: the cream worked. His wife loved it. Her friends loved it. It made their skin look amazing, almost glowing. Like they'd gone back in time ten years. But something was wrong with it.

It was gradual. The women who used it started becoming less responsive. They'd stop mid-conversation, stop reacting to things. Their faces stayed beautiful but became blank, expressionless. Their eyes developed this yellowish shine. One neighbor was found sitting at her kitchen table, perfectly healthy by all medical measures, except she wouldn't move or speak or react to anything.

Ryan's wife was the first to show symptoms.

His later notes are frantic, desperate. He kept trying to fix the formula, to bring back what he called "animation." But he kept describing the same thing over and over: marble-smooth skin, warm like stone, silent like statues in a hall. He said he'd seen them in his dreams and tried to recreate them.

When we found him, he was sitting next to his wife. She wasn't moving. Her skin was white, smooth, almost translucent. He'd applied the cream to her hands, arms, neck, basically everywhere. She looked more like a sculpture than a person.

Ryan was dead too, one hand covered in the cream, the other resting on hers.

I keep thinking he wasn't trying to make her young. He was trying to make her permanent.

Elias was forty-six, a mechanical inventor. Also taking magnesium citrate for insomnia. He built machines for companies but always had side projects going. His wife was traveling for work when things started happening.

We have letters between them. I interviewed her after Elias died. Her hands were shaking the whole time.

She said he'd written to her about a place called "Nerathis." A city with a purple sun and stained-glass windows with gold running through them like veins. He said the stones there were warm to the touch.

She thought he was joking at first, but the next letter was worse. He said the warmth from the stones had followed him back, that his hand had actually blistered like he'd touched something hot. He started sketching the patterns from the windows because they were "too precise to forget."

I asked if she still had the sketches. She'd burned most of them. "They weren't right," she said. "I didn't want my son to see them."

Let me just include parts of his letters:

First letter:

"You wouldn't believe what I dreamed. I was on this street with dark cobblestones, worn completely smooth. The buildings around me looked almost Gothic but inverted somehow, like they were hanging from above instead of rising up. I couldn't see the sky, just this false darkness with a sun the color of grapes. It gave off light but no heat.

Doors opened when I walked past them. Stairs moved under my feet, taking me places I didn't choose. I saw carriages rolling through the streets with no one inside. It felt so real that when I woke up, I was convinced I'd actually been there."

Second letter:

"I dreamed of Nerathis again. Always Nerathis. The doors there are strange, they lead farther than what's physically behind them. They open and close on their own, like the city is guiding me somewhere.

Charles is doing fine in school. Though I've caught him going through my sketches a few times. It worries me a little. Maybe I'm being paranoid. I love you. Don't worry about him. I'll keep him safe.

But these doors... if I could understand how they work, I think I could build them here. Imagine a door that opens wherever you want it to, not just where it's physically located."

Third letter:

"I think I'm starting to figure it out. The doors, I mean. It's in the gold, how it runs through the wood like veins, branching out in patterns. They follow channels. If I could trace the pattern exactly, maybe I could make them work the same way.

Charles comes to see me every evening after school. I know I should play with him more, just talk with him, but instead he watches me work. The neighbor joked about me taking up carpentry and I laughed until my sides hurt. If only it were that simple! Charles calls it the 'magic house.' He says he loves you and misses you, though I think he's enjoying playing assistant more than he'd admit."

Final letter (recovered form police evidence):

"You must be wondering why I haven't written. Forgive me. Charles is gone.

I came back from running an errand and found the workshop door open. I swear I locked it. Inside, everything was disturbed, and the door I'd been building was standing open. It just showed the wall behind it, but I know, I KNOW, it had opened somewhere else. He walked through. There's no other explanation.

The police have questioned me. They don't believe what I'm telling them. They think I was negligent, or worse. They keep asking why a kid would stay so late in a workshop. I can't explain without telling them what I built. But what DID I build? Where is my son? Is he alone there?

I've thought about this constantly. If he's in Nerathis, I have to follow. I hear him in my dreams, faint and far away. He's calling for me. If I can sleep deep enough, long enough, maybe I can find him. The officers are watching me now, but they can't stop me from sleeping. They'll say I ran away, but I'm not running. I'm going to bring Charles back.

Pray for me, though I doubt prayers reach as far as Nerathis. Forgive me if I don't come back."

I need to take a break. My hand is burning hot as I've been writing too much. I'll finish the rest after I get some sleep. I only have thirteen hours left for this report. The light coming through my window is getting dim, kind of purple. I'll need to turn the lamp back on.

I woke up, but something's wrong. The window isn't showing evening light anymore. It's this thick, heavy violet glow. I can't see the street. I can't see anything beyond the glass. The window is humming, very faintly, like it's alive.

The door isn't my door. The handle is bronze, with gold traced through it in veins and channels. I recognize these patterns. I don't want to touch it, but I can already feel heat coming off it, pressing against my skin.

I'm writing this as fast as I can. My hand feels like it's burning, like I've pressed it against a fire. There are figures outside the window now. They're not moving, but every time I look up, they're closer. The room smells like lavender. Someone is calling from beyond the door, faint but persistent.

I'm going to check outside and see what's happening. I'm telling myself this is some elaborate prank by my colleagues, but I know it's not. Someone is tapping at the door now, very lightly, very patiently.

I'll answer it and come back to finish this.
