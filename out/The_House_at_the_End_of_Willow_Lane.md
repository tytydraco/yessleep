When I was twelve, my parents moved us to a small town in the middle of nowhere. My new school was tiny, the kids were all friendly, and the town itself was picturesque—except for one thing: the house at the end of Willow Lane.

It wasn’t like any house I’d ever seen. It loomed behind a tangled maze of overgrown trees and a wrought iron gate rusted from years of neglect. The house looked ancient, with faded brickwork, broken windows, and a porch that seemed one step away from collapsing. No one ever went near it, and the townsfolk would change the subject whenever it came up in conversation.

Naturally, my curiosity got the better of me. I would walk past the house every day on my way home from school, always peering through the gaps in the fence. One October afternoon, as the wind howled and leaves rustled, I noticed something odd—light flickering inside the house.

I tried to convince myself it was just the shadows playing tricks, but the flicker grew into a distinct, rhythmic pulse, like a heartbeat. That night, I lay in bed, unable to sleep. My mind raced with thoughts of what I might find if I dared to investigate. 

The following evening, the flickering light was back. This time, I decided to take action. I waited until dark, grabbed a flashlight, and sneaked out. As I approached the gate, the chill in the air seemed to grow thicker, almost palpable.

With a pounding heart, I pushed open the gate. It creaked loudly, echoing through the silent night. The front door was ajar, just enough for me to slip inside. I entered cautiously, my flashlight cutting through the gloom. The interior was just as decrepit as the outside, filled with dusty furniture draped in white sheets.

I followed the light through the darkened rooms, guided by its relentless pulse. It led me to a door at the end of a narrow hallway. The flickering was intense now, like a strobe light. I hesitated, but then pushed the door open.

Inside, there was a single, small room. In the center was an old-fashioned gramophone, its needle jumping wildly on a record that was spinning faster than it should have been. The room was otherwise empty, but the walls were covered in strange symbols scratched into the peeling paint. 

As I approached the gramophone, I felt a sudden, oppressive weight on my chest. My flashlight flickered and went out. Panic surged through me, and I fumbled with the flashlight, trying to turn it back on. Just then, I heard a whisper—soft, almost imperceptible—coming from behind me.

I spun around, but the room was empty. The whisper grew louder, more insistent, and I realized it was coming from the gramophone. The needle had stopped, but the whispering continued, growing more frantic. I could make out words now—"Come closer… find me…"

A cold draft swept through the room, and I felt a presence, cold and malevolent, brushing against my skin. I could see my breath in the air, and the symbols on the walls seemed to writhe and change. I had to get out. I bolted for the door, but it slammed shut behind me.

Heart racing, I tried to force it open, but it wouldn't budge. The whispering was now a cacophony of voices, and I could hear footsteps approaching from the darkness. My flashlight flickered back on, but the beam was weak and feeble.

In a desperate attempt, I kicked the door, and it finally gave way. I ran through the house, through the tangled mess of rooms, and out into the night. I didn't stop until I was safely home.

To this day, I can't explain what I saw or heard in that house. I never went back, and neither did anyone else. The house remained empty, a looming, silent testament to something sinister that should never have been disturbed.

But every so often, when the wind is just right, I can still hear the faint sound of the gramophone, playing its eerie, unending tune—calling, whispering, and waiting.
