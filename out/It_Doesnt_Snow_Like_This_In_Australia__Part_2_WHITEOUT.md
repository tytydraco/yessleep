[After the horrific events of the last few days](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14c4axl/it_doesnt_snow_like_this_in_australia_whiteout/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), we are all praying for rescue. With so many of our friends killed and no sign of the blizzard easing, things are looking pretty grim. 

Shortly after my last report the monsters finally breached our walls. At about 4am a big ass beetle the size of a football came smashing through one of the high windows. 

Myself and Barry run up to the enormous bug and stomped it flat. With the glass smashed and a large gaping hole in the window snow has been blowing in. Within half an hour our already freezing hall had drastically dropped in temperature. Any thoughts we had of leaving the heating system offline now diminished. If we want to stave off hypothermia, we have got to go get the heating system back online. Or if not migrate to a different building.

Luckily Barry was smart enough to bring his tool bag down to the rec hall, so we are fairly well equipped to fix most things. We gathered some food, water and other supplies into a backpack, grabbed the tool bag and made our way out in to the terrifying blizzard of hell. 

Barry and I braved the weather, tracing the perimeter of the building we made the journey to the plantroom. Fortunately we made it without encountering any of the nightmarish creatures. Barry unlocked the door and we quickly entered the room. 

Barry didn't waste anytime and got to work fixing the heating. Thankfully we found the fault quickly, and were able to get the system back online within half an hour. 

While Barry was packing up all his tools, muffled shouts and screams came through the wall. I called Barry over and we both held our ears to the wall, listening intently. 

No doubt, something serious was unfolding back in the hall. We grabbed our things and bolted back out into the blizzard, racing towards our friends. 

Remember the big ass beetle from earlier? Turns out that was just a pup. As we made it to the front of the hall, we found the door way wide open. The thick wooden door lay splintered on the floor. 

Dozens of angry beetles buzzed around the hall, terrorising our friends. Some of the larger beetles were the size of a Lion, but twice as ferocious. 

What I quickly gathered was that they were seeking revenge for the juvenile bug that Barry and I squashed earlier that morning.

I began to enter the hall, desperately trying to help my dying friends, when Barry grabbed me by the scruff of my jacket. A simple shake of the head from Barry was enough to portray his message. We couldn't do anything now to help our friends.

We stood by powerless as our friends were massacred. The beetles frantically raced around the room, landing on their human prey and knocking them to the ground before eating them alive. 

The larger beetles stood in the center of the room, wings up, stridulating instructions to the smaller beetles. 

Limp husks of our friends lay scattered across the floor. The remaining few screamed out in terror as the beetles pounced on them.

Barry grabbed me and led me away from the hall. 

I'm grateful for Barry's calm head in that situation. Firstly he saved me from aimlessly running to my own death, but secondly he led me to safety. 

We left our former sanctuary of a recreational hall behind, now to forever be known as a graveyard. 

I can't recall much of our journey down to the main hotel building. I was dazed and in shock at what I had witnessed. Again thankful that Barry had the composure to lead us to shelter.

We entered the hotel from the kitchen's loading dock. Initially things looked untouched, but as we entered the main reception foyer we were met with a different story. The large glass doors were shattered, and upturned furniture littered the foyer. Blood splayed up the wall behind the reception desk, undoubtedly human.

Barry hurriedly searched through the reception desk, returning with a handful of room keys. 

We made our way up to the second floor, passing more destruction and signs of struggle. 

We are currently hiding in one of the hotel rooms. I'm struggling now, the trauma of watching so many of my friends die the last few days has set in. 

Barry is trying to talk to me about what we should do next, how we can survive this and get outta here. I'm not so optimistic, I'm struggling with dark thoughts, giving up. I'm not sure.
