**"Flight 249 now boarding, I repeat, Flight 249 now boarding!"**

My head snapped up from my phone to look at the overhead screen. Sure enough, there was the numbers to my flight. Flight 249, One way to Scotland. This was it.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up my bags and began walking to the terminal, walking toward the metaphorical gateway to my new life. I looked back one last time behind me, taking one last look at what I was soon to be leaving behind. For a moment, I was actually hesitant to go the rest of the way through the terminal.

*There's nothing for you here, Rick.* I reminded myself before taking another deep breath. *She's gone now. They both are.* I took a moment to let one or two stray tears fall down my face before facing forward and walking through the terminal. I quietly found a seat and made myself comfortable.

Strangely, I can remember just how quiet it was while the flight was boarding. People stepped onto the plane, disregarding each other for the most part. Everyone had this cold, lifeless look on their faces, like they, too, were trying to just get the hell out of town the same way I was. It was about another half hour before the announcement came over the loudspeaker. That I think if it, I don't remember at any point hearing any of the cabin attendants going over safety procedures or anything, though, I admittedly wasn't paying much attention to much once I'd sat down, having put my earbuds in and turned on my ASMR app.

I was exhausted, having prepared for this trip for at least a week straight. I couldn't sleep at all through that week, nor do I think any of you would've been able to either if every time you closed your eyes, you had the same nightmare. If every time you laid down at night, you saw the face of your loved one be engulfed in fire, screaming out to you to save them, before having her flesh seared from her bones, would you be able to sleep peacefully?

To this day, I still wonder how the hell I didn't lose my mind long before all this went down. Being perfectly honest, I should've gone mad when it all happened, especially given just how little of what happened that I understood.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

It was two years ago that Irene and I had decided to go to the mountains for our 3 year anniversary. The two of us were a couple of sweethearts since college and I even proposed to her at our graduation party. Since then, we had been a happy little pair of lovebirds until that day.

Like I said, I can't really describe much of what happened in any comprehensible way. So much happened so quickly. I remember me and her were hiking about three quarters of the way up the mountain when we stopped, having to rest our legs. Panting, I remarked to her, "Jeez, you'd think after all that time doing track, we'd have made it a little further, huh?"

"Says you," she replied, scoffing. She made her voice try to go deep to sound like me, saying, *"Oh hon, can we PLEASE stop, I gotta rest my legs."*

"I said that cause you were draggin' ass behind me, slowpoke." She smirked, flipped me off, and delivered a punch to the shoulder for my smart ass mouth. I laughed and said, "You call that a punch? Come on, mama, I know you can hit harder than *that*." She snickered before stiffening her upper lip into a defiant smirk and trying to hit me again. This time, I caught her wrists and trapped them in a criss-cross, holding her still. She struggled against me for a second before conceding.

Sighing, she said, "Okay, babe, you win. You're the strongest. And the handsomest." She said this last part with a wink and a sly grin parting the corner of her mouth. I almost didn't even notice though, having lost myself in her eyes; those ember red jewels that sat peacefully in the middle of two oceans of midnight seas, burning right through my eyes, through my mind, and straight through to my heart and soul every time I stared into them. For a moment, the only sound around the two of us, the only signs of life from around us, was the singular sound of the breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs.

"What?" she asked. I shook my head, blinking.

"Huh?" I asked.

"Can I go now, officer?" she joked, her grin growing amused again. I looked down to see I still had her wrists. I chuckled nervously, releasing her wrists.

"Sorry about that. Just... kinda lost myself there for a sec."

"What do you mean?" Her sly grin returned. "You tryin' to say you like playin' rough?" She giggled and winked. I chuckled.

"No just... God, have I told you that you have the prettiest eyes in the world?"

She snickered and replied, "A million times, actually; 3,000 just today." I smiled.

"And I'll happily tell you a million times more." After that, the silence pervaded the trail around us. The only sounds of life around us was the early autumn breeze whipping our hair and the clothes on our backs. Gradually, almost unconsciously, our bodies came closer and closer to one another until eventually, our eyes closed and our lips met. We stayed locked on each other's embrace for a whole 25 seconds, the heat of the moment actually drowning out the chill of the wind pricking our bodies. I'd like to say that we'd have never separated, had it not been for the fact that I could feel the heat intensify from her body.

It was a whole five seconds before I opened my eyes, doing so only after I felt Irene's hands jerk away from my body like she was in a hurry to get away from me. When I did open my eyes, I saw Irene looking horrified at her hands. "Irene?" I asked, feeling my heart rate jump from 0 to 10,000 in that half a second time span. "Baby, what's wrong?"

She looked at me, opening her mouth to speak, only to get cut off by a sharp cry of pain that had her doubling over, clutching her stomach. "Irene!" I reached out to her, but instantly retracted when I saw her body beginning to glow. She cried out in pain, her body glowing brighter and brighter. I began to feel heat, *intense* heat, like her body in itself was an exploding star, emitting from her body that I even saw beginning to singe the hair from my arms.

The brighter her body glowed, the harder it became for me to be able to see her. I shouted, "Irene!" For a brief moment, I saw her eyes stare back at me, wide and afraid.

"Richard!" she cried. When I reached for her again, a searing pain ran across my arm and when I pulled it back, I saw the skin beginning to blister. Before I could try again, to do *anything*, her body released a sort of shockwave of blinding light that coupled with a scorching blaze of heat that made me almost swear for a moment that I was on fire. I was forced to shield my eyes and when I opened them again, I was alone.

I looked all around. Nothing. "I-Ir-Irene?" My head swung furiously all around. "Irene! IRENE!"

There was no answer, from anywhere. My head stopped swinging when I looked down at where she was standing. Right there, in front of me, in place of my beautiful wife, was a large black spot where I could see small wafts of smoke jumping from it to pollute the sky. At that moment, I dropped to my knees and began screaming Irene's name deliriously. I'd have sworn I was there for next to an eternity, having continued my howling until my throat tore itself in half (not even much of an exaggeration, either, judging from the doctor's visit I had to take later on because of it), but at some point, a couple walking by found me and asked me what was wrong.

I'll say two things; first, bless them for actually giving enough of a damn to stop and want to even *try* listening to some howling stranger who no doubt scared the hell out of them with his racket, and second, if they *were* able to understand a damn bit of the inane gibberish I was spewing at them, then they deserve an award of some sort. I tried my best to tell them, in one way or another, that my wife was missing.

They helped me down and off the mountain -- by which I really mean they more or less dragged me away from the black, smoldering remains of my wife, kicking and screaming like a lunatic (Like I said, bless them) -- and escorted me to the nearest police station. From there, it was more or less the same situation, with me trying to explain something to them that I didn't understand while having no composure whatsoever. Long story short, they told me to go home and that they'd search for her. Told me they'd find her...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

I started awake on the plane. For a moment, my head swiveled around the cabin. *IRENE?!*

Everything was still quiet. Everyone was still, facing forward, either with their heads down, likely on their phones or something, or just staring blankly at the cockpit. I relaxed once more in my seat.

*She's gone Rick...*

I looked out of the window to my right. The sky was a perfect shade of blue, the kind of shade you don't normally see unless you're right there in it, swimming or at least floating in it. Unless it's all around you, in a way that's achievable only when you're 50,000 feet in the air, on a plane...

Or on a mountainside...

I shook my head, turning away from the window. *It's been two goddamn years. She's gone, she ain't coming back.* Readjusting myself in my chair, I refixed my earbuds and restarted the app. In seconds, I was once again in sleep's numbing embrace. images of the perfect blue sky, of Irene, were soo quite literally drowned out by those of gray, cloudy skies, unleashing a torrential downpour upon stone cold earth. It was the perfect diversion. Anodyne, of you will, allowing me to completely forget about Irene. Forget about my old life. Forget that I was alone...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

"I have your heart, so long as it beats, Ricky-boy..." she said, giggling. She sat on my lap as I laid across my old, torn up couch, straddling me, wearing her sports bra and leggings. She'd just gotten home from Yoga practice. She'd hopped on me as soon as she'd walked through the door.

She was smiling down at me, causing me to lose myself in her eyes. She ran her fingers along my chest, slowly running them along so I'll feel every soft inch of them as she went. "Well, I'm glad to see you home, too, babe." I replied, chuckling. She giggled her adorable little girlish giggle; a giggle who's sound is matched by the giggle of a baby, before leaning down to touch her nose to mine. "What's the occasion?" I asked, grinning.

"What do you mean?" she replied with her own smile widening.

"You're awfully cheery this afternoon. Usually, you're tired after yoga practice. What, did you have a little extra something in your shake today?" She laughed, throwing your head back.

"Maybe a *little* bit..." she replied with a joking sense of guilt, giving me the look a child gives when they're caught eating glue paste.

"A little bit, huh?"

"Uh-huh..."

"God, you're adorable, you know that?"

"Like you'll ever let me forget." she joked. "And you're such a little goof, you know that?"

I winked, "Like you'd ever let me forget." Her grin stretched from one ear to the other as she gave me a peck on the nose before laying her head down on my chest, nuzzling her head directly in the center of my pecs. Looking down at her, with the rays of the afternoon sun just ever so gently stroking her face the same way her fingers so tenderly caressed my chest, giving her an almost blazing aura that I could actually detect the heat from, I told myself, *Yep, Ricky-boy, you really are the luckiest man alive. Despite the rinky-dink apartment, long, exhausting -- though decently paying -- job, and whatever bullshit you carry around with you in your day to day life, you have this angel on your chest, and she happily holds your heart.*

The heat radiating from her began getting to me more and more. I noticed beads of sweat forming on my forehead. I began looking around the room, looking for the thermostat. Her head raised up again to look me in the eyes. "Baby, what's wrong?"

"Huh? Oh, uh, nothing, just..." I paused for a moment, a feeling of nausea briefly taking effect on me. "Is it getting hot in here?" She chuckled.

"No, I think it's just you." She winked saying this. I chuckled, though not as relaxed as before, and replied, "Yeah, but seriously, though, you don't feel that?"

"Feel what?"

"I don't know, it's burning up in here. Can you see the thermostat?" She looked over to the far corner of the living room.

"It's only room temperature, hon," she said, her smile slowly giving way to a look of concern. "Are you feeling okay?"

"I think so." She put her the back of her had to my forehead. Almost immediately I winced, feeling like a scorching piece of metal had been pressed against it.

"Oh shit, Ricky, you *are* burning up."

"Look who's talking." I joked. Her face, however, told me she wasn't taking it that way. Her eyebrows raised.

"Huh?"

"You're even hotter than I am right now."

"Babe, I'm serious, I think you have a fever."

"I'm serious, too, your hand was just shy of singeing my hair just now." She got up and walked into the kitchen before returning with a glass of water and a couple of Tylenols. For just a moment, I swore I saw the water in the glass begin bubbling, the way it would if it were boiling. I didn't say anything, though.

"Here, take a couple of these. I'll make some food later, okay?" I did as requested, despite knowing damn well I didn't have a fever. After that, she went to take a shower. I laid alone on the couch, alone once again. My mind was divided between thoughts of joining her in the shower and wonder at just what happened there.

What was going on with Irene's skin just now, I wondered. I know she was directly under the sun and all, but it shouldn't have heated up like that, should it? I ended up electing the former option, to join her, and got up from the couch, undressing as I went toward the bathroom. I, almost skillfully in a way, managed to slip into the bathroom completely unnoticed; quieter than a mouse. Immediately upon entering, though, I noticed just how humid the air became. From the instant I walked in, it was like I'd walked into a steam room, moisture and steam from the air almost suffocating me. I actually had to turn around and walk right back out.

*How the hell can SHE stand it in there?* I looked back into the bathroom. The water was still running, steam was still billowing out in clouds from the open doorway. Despite this, I could still hear Irene's soft, tender voice singing *"May it be",* not at all impeded by the heat. At one point, starting to put my clothes back on, I looked in the bathroom and my eyes widened when I saw a bright orange glow coming from. I was about to investigate further, but before I could reach the bathroom again, the glow disappeared and the water was turned off.

Not knowing what the hell I was supposed to do -- if anything, really -- I went back to laying on the couch. Irene stepped out of the bathroom, towel drying her hair while the towel around her body slowly found itself falling away from her, "accidentally" revealing herself. Normally, I'd either get caught red-handed staring or I'd try to pretend not to notice; both of which elicited sly, playful giggles from her before one thing would lead to another and well...

But this time when she caught me staring, it was with a puzzled look on my face. "What is it, hon?" she asked.

"Um, nothing, just... I thought I saw something."

"What?"

"I don't know, something glowing." She frowned.

"Glowing?"

"Yeah, from the bathroom, while you were in the shower." She turned to look back at the bathroom before looking at me while pointing to it. I held up my dismissively. She did another double-take before shrugging the whole thing off and telling me that she was tired out after yoga and that she'd be going to lay down. She went into the bedroom while I remained on the couch; alone, confused.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

I awoke, this time needing the restroom. It was night out, though everyone still appeared awake. Hundreds of blank eyes, dead faces, and hollow stares all focused forward. I'll admit, by this point, this was beginning to unnerve me. Why was everybody seemingly acting weird, all at the same time?

Regardless, I slowly walked to the back of the cabin toward the restroom. At least, where I *thought* the restroom was. When I made it to the other end of the plane, though, as far as I could go, anyways, I couldn't find the restrooms anywhere. I looked and started back in the other direction. Along the way, I kept looking along the walls to see if maybe I missed the sign along the way. Needless to say, though, I hadn't.

Then I started looking for an attendant or someone who might be able to help me. Through all of this, silence itself had a chokehold on the entire plane. I felt like I wasn't even *on* a plane, like I wasn't even *awake*! I made it to the front end of the plane and knocked in the door to the cockpit. I stood there for about a good 15 minutes with nothing at all happening. I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to knock again or just go back to my seat. In the end, the answer, to my surprise, would be neither as, shockingly, the door opened and out stepped a young, rail thin lady in an attendant's uniform.

"Excuse me, ma'am?" I asked. She didn't respond, or move -- or even seem to breathe for that matter. "Sorry to bother you, but I can't seem to find the restroom, you think you'd be able to help me out?"

She continued staring at me with almost corpselike eyes; glazed looking and grayish white in color. Her mouth also seemed to hang sort of limply. Her face perfectly portrayed the emptiness of both her mind and her heart. In this sense, she didn't look dead -- she was *less than dead*. I waved my hand in front of her face, garnering no response from that, either.

"Ahem, may I speak to the captain, then?" For the record, I knew that this wouldn't ever be allowed under normal circumstances, but A, these weren't exactly "normal circumstances", were they, and B, I was on the verge of slapping her just to get *some* kind of reaction or answer out of her, ad so I figured asking something a bit ludicrous wasn't altogether pointless.

More to my shock, it actually worked as she slowly spoke, saying in the most scratchy, monotone voice, devoid entirely of any recognizable emotion, save *maybe* depression (and even that's a bit of a stretch), "Please return to your seat, sir. We will be reaching our final destination soon."

The way her mouth moved, coupled with the deadpanned tone in her voice, I almost swore it was some sort of puppet talking to me. "Um... O-Okay, but I need the restroom, can you just tell me where--"

"The time is almost here, sir. It will all be over soon." My eyes widened.

"E-Excuse me?" I said, feeling my heart already starting to kick into overdrive.

"It will all be over soon, sir." she repeated, slowly turning back toward the door.

"B-But wait--"

"Please return to your seat, sir." was the last thing I heard from her before she shut the door back in my face. For a moment, I stood, dumbfounded. *The hell was that? What was her problem?*

I turned to look back at the other passengers. Each one of them stared unblinkingly toward me; not at me, but rather *through* me, the same way the attendant was just a second ago. *What the hell is going on?*

I would've been a lot more inclined to press the attendant again for answers -- namely what the hell she meant by "It will all be over soon" -- but unfortunately, my need for the bathroom all but diminished any concentration I had with that. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and start hunting for the restroom myself again. I went through the cabin for about another 10 minutes, each one that passed making it harder and harder to hold it in, until I finally found what looked like a restroom about midway through. How I missed it, especially given that it was located just a few rows from where I was sitting, I didn't know, nor did I care.

I rushed as quickly as I could to the door and swung it open before all but hurling myself headfirst inside. While I was in there, I started thinking again about what the flight attendant said. Now normally, I'd have chalked it up to just her having an off day or something. But then, why was *everybody* having an off day? Why was she the only one that'd speak at all?

*"We'll be reaching our final destination soon, sir."*

*Why does that sound so familiar?* I thought then of her voice. Her face, how lifeless it looked, as well as the faces of the other passengers. All of it was familiar to me in a way that gave me an almost physically sickening feeling...

But why?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

"You okay, honey bunny?" I asked her. She was on the couch, looking glumly out of the window. Her eyes broke from the window to look at me. The expression on her face was dead, careless, unfiltered, untouched with any sort of emotion. "Irene, what's wrong?"

She sighed, a sort of sigh that I almost couldn't hear. It was less like a sigh, actually, and more like she was just giving away her last breath. My heart melted right then and there, not even knowing what the hell was wrong. The sun shone, clear skies, and we were even off from work that day. I was even planning on surprising her with a trip to the movies -- her number one go-to when it came to ideas for date nights.

I went over and reached out to put my hand on her shoulder when she retracted away from my hand. I froze, unsure of what I should or even *could* do. In all of that time, a little over two and a half years into our marriage, she'd never once gotten into moods like this. She always had the most beaming, vibrant, free-spirited personality I'd ever seen in a woman. She'd always been the sunshine to *my* cloudiest days, while I was always the one that kept her "down to the Earth" so to speak, keeping her feet on the ground, you know? But this...

"Irene, baby, talk to me, what happened?" She looked at me; looking more *through* my eyes than at them. Her mouth slowly opened and she spoke in a voice I almost couldn't believe was coming from her. It sounded like I was hearing an answering machine talk to me -- with somehow even *less* inflection than one, if that was even possible.

"It's all going to end soon."

"Wh-What?" I frowned. She kept staring, her face not wavering in the slightest. "Baby, what're you talking about, *what's* ending?"

She looked to the window again. I followed her gaze. Everything was normal outside. Vibrant. Alive. Cheerful.

"It's all ending, I can feel it." I slowly put my hand on her shoulder. I instantly jerked back when I felt that her skin was all of a sudden blistering hot again. It'd done this a few times before, and I could never understand why.

"Baby, you're burning up." I said to her. Her eyes didn't move from the window this time.

"It's coming to an end. Everything."

"I-I don't understand, what're you--"

"Look at it all, Rick." I stopped, turning back toward the window. "It's beautiful, isn't it?"

I stayed silent for a moment before answering, "Y-Yeah it-it is." She let out another very faint sigh.

"Something's happening, Rick. To me. I-I..." She trailed off for a moment before finishing with, "I can feel it."

"What's coming?" I asked.

"I... I don't know. I don't know what it is or why it's happening, but... I know it is, and it's happening soon." About ten to twenty minutes passed in silence after that. There was no real comeback for that, no optimistic or comforting thought I could give. Call me what you will; "Terrible consolation", "Poor bedside manner", or what have you, I didn't have any words of comfort to offer my wife in that moment. Like I said, she had never behaved or talked like this before, so I had absolutely no way to respond to this. And also like I mentioned, I was never the most uplifting type myself.

Doing my best to at least *try* to comfort her, I spoke up in my cheeriest voice possible (though one that likely wouldn't have cheered up a crying child, let alone someone as depressed as she was), "Hey, I think we should go to the movies today! We don't have work and I believe they're playing--" I stopped when she turned to look at me, her face still dead as a doornail.

"Did you not hear a word I just said?" She asked, her voice remaining in it's deadlocked monotone. I clammed up. "I... I just can't, Rick. Not when I know it's all going to be over soon anyway." She took one last look at the window before getting up from the couch and walking into the bedroom.

"Wait, Irene, what're you--" But she was shutting the door right as I was finishing. I stayed in the living room, sitting alone, speechless, with both my heart jackhammering in my chest as well as my head spinning all the way around like my it was a globe for a solid fifteen minutes. I couldn't decided whether I was supposed to go to her, to try again to comfort her, *somehow*, or if I should just stay there, sitting on my knees, staring at the hallway, jaw slacked, like an idiot.

I wanted to hold her, don't get me wrong. I wanted to squeeze her the way you'd squeeze a plush toy when you were sad. I wanted to clutch her tightly to me like if I were to let go, I and the whole of reality would fall apart. But then, would that have made any difference?

Regardless, a few moments later, I decided to get up from the floor and walked into the bedroom. On the bed laid my wife, laying straight and stiff on her right side, facing away from the doorway. I froze at the sight for two reasons. For starters, she never slept like this. She was always one to curl up into a ball, making it perfect to nuzzle against me, giving me that almost fatherly feeling like I was nestling a sleeping child next to me. But now this, as well the fact that her body was glowing.

I rubbed my eyes to make sure I was seeing it correctly. Sure enough, amid the darkness, with the only *other* light perhaps coming from the window, bleeding past the curtains, there she was, a golden aura beaming around her. She was stiff, rigid, still, making me wonder if she was awake, asleep, or if she was dead. My foot raised to take a step, but I wasn't sure what to do. Of course, the logical answer would've been to go to her, maybe snuggle her close to me and say... well, that was just it, what the hell *was* I supposed to say?

My wife was glowing, and like the other times before, I could feel the heat blazing from her body. She was a sun in the middle of a dark abyss, a flame flickering in a dark hallway, one that appeared to be flickering out. The sight of this was killing me with every second I spent looking at it because of the fact that I knew she was in pain, but from what I couldn't begin to know. I finally took the step forward, then another, and another.

My feet more or less moved absently from my body. My mind and my body acted separate from each other; with every instinct telling me I needed to stay at the doorway and (albeit feebly) try figuring out what the hell's going on before I try going to her, while my body all but flipped its deuces at that and continued forward. I silently reached the bed, where I slowly climbed in behind her and went to put my arm around her when I froze, a stinging pain starting to shoot throughout my arm.

My arm hovered there for a moment before curling back to my body. And so, unable to touch her or say anything to her, I just laid there, staring at her stiffened back. The room was warm, quiet, the way you'd imagine a fireplace to sound, save the crackle of the flames. I don't know when or how long it'd been when I had the idea, but I suddenly found it in me to speak up. "Hey, you wanna do something cool for our anniversary?"

She made no movements, voicing no response. I continued anyway, "You know, we never did get to make it to the top of the mountains like we'd always planned." She still didn't move, but I did see the glow around her starting to dim. Out of a sort of instinct, I reached out again to tough her back. It was still warm, but tolerable and becoming cooler and cooler by the second. I couldn't tell you why, other than a guess that whatever the hell it was that was going on with her, it was somehow liked to her emotions or something. In other words, my words were getting through to her in some way, comforting her.

I started softly caressing her back along the length of her spine. Her skin continued to cool under my fingers. "I can still see us," I started again, forming the image in my head of the two of us on the mountainside that day, three years ago, the day I first proposed to her. "You remember, Baby?"

"The clear, sunny sky, the big puffy clouds." I chuckled, "You always call them "Sky pillows". Remember how we were laying down and looking at the sky pillows, trying to see who'd be the first to spot one that looked like a fish?" Her body had all but stopped glowing by now and her body was just mildly lukewarm. Her skin felt soft and mellow again.

"I think you were the first one to actually find one. Said it looked like Nemo for some reason. I couldn't ever see it..."

"Marlin." I heard her say faintly.

"Huh?"

"It was Marlin, not Nemo." I chuckled.

"Right, Marlin, my bad."

"He was bigger than most of the other ones, but still only noticeable if you were looking, just like an actual fish in the ocean. Just like you." That's when I finally felt her body start to move beneath my fingers. She shifted around to face me. Her face was hard to see, with only half of it illuminated by the ever-dimming rays from the window. That said, I could see that her haunting glare of sorrow, her empty stare, was gone, replaced with a more familiarly tender and loving face, the one a mother gives her child when they're what makes them smile that day.

"You always stood out to me; my lost little fish, alone in the sea, looking for something, but wasn't sure what." Her hand moved up to my chest, stroking it like how I stroked her back.

"You always had the better eyes of us both." I said. "We stayed out there till the sun started going down."

"And all the little sky pillows went away..." she finished, slipping a small, yet oh, so adorable little giggle.

I snickered, "Remember how we fell asleep, right there on the mountainside, and the ranger had to wake us up to run us out of there?" I giggled, "And you thought he was "Smokey the bear." Her laugh was noticeable this time. "You started freaking out and I had to hold onto you to keep from going apeshit on the guy." I took a deep breath then before asking her, "You remember what I said to you?"

She rolled over again, putting her face first on top of me, looking directly into my eyes, and she answered, "Irene, baby doll, I will always love you, till the end of time". You reached into your pocket and pulled out this ring, the most beautiful ring I'd ever seen." She held up her finger. "And I grabbed you up and tried to snap you in half with a bear hug."

"Damn near did, too." I said, chuckling. She grinned a toothy grin, allowing the last rays of light from the window to accentuate each and every one of her beautiful, ivory teeth. She moved in closer, bringing her nose close to mine, and the two of us kissed. Knowing now that her skin was normal again, I slowly brought my hands up to take ahold of her gently. The two of stay in an eternal embrace for the rest of that afternoon, with her falling asleep curled up next to me, her face nuzzled in my chest.

I stayed awake, though. I was unable to sleep. I couldn't risk the thought of something happening to her while I was asleep.

*"It's all going to end anyways..."*

Her words echoed through my head, hollowing it out in my brain, making *it* the single dominant thought. It was a lone voice that looped in my head, piercing the otherwise peacefully quiet atmosphere of the bedroom. What could any of it mean, though?

I looked down at my wife's beautiful face, sound asleep, and wondered just what could've been going through that beaming, amazing mind of hers. What could she have been dreaming about? Was that what started this? Maybe she just had a bad dream and took it too seriously?

*But what was going on with her body?* I ran my hand along her back again. other than being maybe a *bit* warmer than normal, her skin was otherwise completely normal. She remained still, not fidgeting or talking in her sleep the way she usually would if she was having a nightmare. She was sound. She was safe. I hugged her as close to me as I could and held her like that until the sun rose the next morning.

*"... All coming to an end..."*
