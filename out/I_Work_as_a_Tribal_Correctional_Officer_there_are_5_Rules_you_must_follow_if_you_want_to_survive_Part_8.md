My name is Will. Based on what I’ve read, I know you’ve seen my name before. Jay’s missing. I’ve written and re-written those words too many times, and they still don’t feel real. 

Let me catch everyone up to speed on what happened. About six weeks ago, I woke up to a knock on my door. Nobody was there but there was an envelope with a note and a thumb drive inside. The note contained Jay’s logins for some of his online accounts and the message, ‘Will, it’s time to stop pretending it didn’t happen.’

I made sure nobody was watching and went inside. When I plugged the thumb drive into the computer, there was a single folder labeled ‘Evidence.’ The first thing I noticed was a text document labeled ‘For Will.’ I sat there in shock, just looking at the screen. I had just seen Jay the day before and everything was normal. We joked around and made plans to go on a hike over the weekend. He never made any comments about leaving or being worried about anything, but this had me replaying everything in my head. Every joke, every interaction, every good-bye. Nothing sticks out. Even now, nothing sticks out. He hid it well, even from me. I knew I had to open the file, but I couldn’t.

After a minute or two, I stood up and paced my room asking myself, *Where did he go? Why leave this to me?* I know the answer to the former, that one was obvious, but the latter? That was the real question. One I’m still trying to figure out.

I tried to lay back down and go to sleep telling myself, *get some rest and revisit this with a clean head.* Of course, that only resulted in me tossing and turning until the sunlight filled my room. So, I did what I knew Jay wanted. I pulled myself out of bed, grabbed an energy drink, and opened the file he left for me.

Now, I want to make something clear, I didn’t know Jay was documenting anything let alone posting his experiences. When I opened the text file, my heart sank as I read the first line. “Will, if you’re reading this, I’m gone.”

I read that line a few times not believing it was real. I called Jay’s phone to no answer. “C’mon pick up.” I whispered as it rang on the second call, still no answer. Looking up at my ceiling, I screamed in frustration. I called again. “Third time’s a charm,” I laughed nervously.

This time the call went through. “Will?” Mary’s voice came through. She sounded like she was crying.

“Mary?” I asked, almost yelling. “Where’s Jay? What’s going on?”

She didn’t immediately say anything, but I could hear her muffled crying in the silence. “Jay’s dead.” Her voice was shaky but firm.

“Dead? Mary what the fuck do you mean ‘Jay’s dead’?!” I fell to my knees. “What the fuck happened?”

“I don’t know. Two officers woke me up this morning and said they found his car on the side of the road.” Her voice was panicked and pained. “They said he wasn’t in the car but they found blood and ripped clothing half a mile into the woods.”

Tears welled up in my eyes, “I’m so sorry, Mary.”

“There’s no way this is real, right? They don’t have a body so there’s a chance, right?” Her questions sounded more like begging.

“What do you mean there’s no body?”

“They said that there was only clothing and blood found. I asked to see the clothes or if they were going to test the blood to see if it’s even a match to his blood type.” Mary explained through sobs. “They told me that they knew it was him and—”

“What did they look like?” I cut her off.

“What? Why does that mat—”

“Mary, what did the officers look like? Were they in plain clothes? Uniform? Suits?”

“They,” Mary paused for a moment, “were in suits.”

Something didn’t feel right. Every cop I know has said they almost always notify next of kin of a death while in uniform. “Come over.”

“What? Why?”

“Jay told me if anything ever happened to him, to take care of you.” Something in my gut screamed that this wasn’t a private phone call.

“Oh,” her voice was somber, “okay.”

“I’ll see you in a bit.” I said before hanging up the phone.

I stood up and continued reading his note.

“I’ve been posting about every weird/unexplainable thing that has happened to us since I started at the jail. On this thumb drive, you will find all the evidence I’ve uncovered over the last few years. I hoped I had enough time to get the full story out there but over the last few months, strange things have been happening. You remember that car accident I got into last week? I was on my way to Carrie’s office to meet with her mentor to go over what happened before she went missing. I didn’t tell anyone where I was going, but I noticed a car following me down all the side streets. I saw the car that hit me drive by in the opposite direction multiple times before hitting me on the main road. Right before the accident, the car following me just drove off.”

I remember that accident and all he said was that he got hit by a drunk driver. Thinking back over the years, there were a few different times where he fell, had car trouble, or his house got broken into but nothing was stolen. They all never added up, but I didn’t think anything of it at the time. Hindsight being 20/20, they were messages disguised as unfortunate accidents.

“I don’t think I was meant to survive that accident. I put this package together when I got home. I knew they were going to finish the job. Will, you are the only one I can trust with this. I tried keeping you in the dark after ‘the incident’ because I knew you just wanted to forget about it. I wish I would have done the same. What’s done is done though. If you haven’t gone through everything yet, this drive holds all the evidence I gathered. We’ve watched them cover up every death, every missing persons case, and every ‘accident’ that damn forest has caused. I tried to expose them, but I didn’t have time. I’ve left you my login information. If they are willing to take me out, they are scared. Don’t let them cover up what happened to me.”

I wiped the tears from my face and started looking at the other files. There were photos of the land the jail sat on both before and after it was built, drone footage of the land now, declassified documents on incidents surrounding the forest, transcripts from his appointments with Carrie and three obituaries. Nothing stood out to me until I got to the obituaries, they were the only ones that he didn’t rename the files. They were labeled “Obituaryscandownload(1).pdf” the only difference being the number.

Starting with the first one, I opened it up, it was Ryan’s. I remember when Ryan’s obituary came out. This one was different from the one that I had framed in my living room next to his picture. The contents were the same but the publication date was different. The one I have framed was dated as being published a week after his death. This one, however, was dated the day before we found him on the perimeter road, a week before he died.

Next was Carrie’s. Prior to reading Jay’s posts, I had only heard about her once. A week after the incident in the yard, I saw an obituary for her in the paper. I found a copy of her official obituary online, and, just like with Ryan’s, this one was dated a week before the published one too.

When I opened the third, my chest tightened when I saw Jay’s face. I looked for the date listed and, just like the others, it was listed as a week prior. The room began to spin, I sat back and tried to breathe, but my lungs refused to cooperate. My hands shook as I tried to compose myself. After what felt like hours, I was able to focus on the screen. It detailed how Jay was a beloved Corrections Officer, husband, friend, and how much he will be missed.

There was one detail I almost missed. Jay’s obituary file was two pages. Both Ryan and Carrie’s obituary files were one page only. I scrolled to the second page and saw a note. “This just came in. BE CAREFUL. -E.” It wasn’t Jay’s handwriting and there was a datestamp on the bottom of the page, the same date as on the obituary.

Before I could even process what was in front of me, Mary knocked on my door. I let her in and sat her down on the couch. “Something isn’t right.” I said.

“They said it was his uniform.” She said flatly.

“He wasn’t scheduled to work.” I said.

She looked up at me, “I counted his clothes, every uniform he has is accounted for. How could his uniform be torn up in the woods if all of them are in the closet?”

Silence hung in the air as we both realized what was happening.

“I need you to see something.” I said before walking her to my computer.

I left her alone in my room while she read through everything. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of whiskey and went back to the living room. After a couple hours, I had downed half the bottle before Mary walked into the room.

“I can’t go home.”

I handed her the bottle, “Here, this will help.”

“Thanks.”

“You can stay in the guest room as long as you need.” I got up from the couch and stumbled to the hall closet. Pulling out a blanket and some pillows, I opened the door and threw them on the bed.

Mary just nodded and sat on the edge of the bed. She took a swig from the bottle and laid back. “Do you really think he’s gone?”

“I don’t know what to think anymore. Whoever this ‘E’ person is, knows something though.” I backed out of the room, “Get some rest.” I said while pulling the door closed.

In my room, I fell onto the bed. As I laid there, looking up at nothing, I whispered, “I won’t let them cover you up.”
