I hear the applause through the burlap wrapped on my head. There is a twinkling sound, like a tiny, out of tune piano. I can hear that it is near me. The clapping hasn’t ceased, but it is quieter now. It’s like the piano is drowning out all the noise.

The people, or whatever is making the sound of clapping, start to clap in a rhythmic pattern. Clap clap clap… clap… clap… clap… clap clap clap. It is slow and drawn out. Then it speeds up without reason. It’s like whoever is clapping is trying to find the tempo of the piano music.

I am brought back to reality when I realize something is near me. I can feel the warmth of its body. Actually, I feel the lack thereof. The figure is cold, but the room is colder. Well, I think it’s a room.

I move my knees and feel concrete and rocks. I stop on account of the pain the rocks stabbing my bare skin causes.

My hands are tied to my ankles behind my back. It’s hard to stay balanced while kneeling in this predicament, but I need to feel some sort of control. I don’t know what’s going on. 

The clapping continues in irregular beats, trying to catch up to the piano, then trying to wait for it. Clap clap clap… clap… clap… clap… clap clap clap.

I start to wriggle, testing the strength of the rope. I feel the burn around my wrists. The being near me moves closer. It was so still, I had forgotten it was there. 

What I guess is its mouth moves next to my head. Even through the burlap, I can feel the hot, rancid breath pierce my face. The heat contrasts its frigid presence.

I open my mouth to try and get answers. The skin around my mouth is sore and damp. I attempt to use my tongue to wet my lips. 

As I swipe my tongue around my mouth, it takes longer than it usually would. My lips seem to extend wider than I remember them doing so. My mouth is so dry, I can’t taste or feel much.

I move my mouth a bit more, trying to produce saliva. I get a bit of spit to awaken my mouth, but it tastes weird. I taste iron, and then begin to recognize the familiar taste of blood. My lips were coated in it. 

My tongue feels the edge of my mouth and through a confused state, I understand that I am probably in a worse place than I thought.

My mouth is cut a little bit at each corner. They don’t feel like clean cuts though. I can’t feel much pain, so I stick my tongue through the new crevice in my face. I can feel jagged edges, like it was abruptly ripped.

Clap clap clap… clap… clap… clap… clap clap clap. The applause that started to sound a lot less like clapping, meshing with the piano. It’s like the piano isn’t playing notes, but controlling the claps.

“Jason?”

I freeze.

“Terry?”

A discombobulated voice repeats, “Jason?”

I try to think of a reasonable explanation. This was supposed to be just a game. It wasn’t even my idea.

“Jason? Are you there? Please….please just stop…”

No. This doesn’t make any sense.

“I don’t want to play anymore, guys. This isn’t fun.”

“Okay… guys this isn’t funny, just let me stop,” I plead with the rest of the group.

I get no answer.

This isn’t supposed to be real. It was a game we found in a book. One of the guys suggested it, because what would the harm be?

I try to move, but the knots are a lot harder than I thought them to be. As I thrash around, my head hits the thing next to me, and all noise fades away. No piano and no applause. The only thing I seem to hear is my own heartbeat and the breathing of whatever is hovering over me.

Its breath is irregular like the clapping and sounds frantic. I recognize it. It is like a recording.

I think back to only an hour ago when me and my friends found this ‘dream game’ where you can enter another dimension of sorts. Luke suggested it, but he’s also the only one who believes in the occult.

Even if it didn’t work, messing with the guys while they slept would have been funny. Throwing all of their stuff outside into the rain, drawing crude things on them…. dragging them outside and leaving them. We were always joking around, even taking it too far sometimes.

Something touches my face. It is sharp, like a talon, and it slowly drags down the burlap. It cuts a layer of burlap, allowing me to see some light. I remember one of the rules, do not look into the light, no matter what happens. I squeeze my eyes shut.

“Jason?”

“No..NO! This isn’t real,” I try to comfort myself as the entity wraps itself around me.

“Please…please just let me in… it’s so cold,” I hear that familiar chattering.

“Oh God, I’m sorry! I ‘m so sorry...” a lump in my throat grows and my eyes burn. Even through my shut eyes, tears begin to seep out.

“Jason…just..let me in…” Every word, every pause, every quiver, is encapsulated in my mind, and it’s playing out again.

I sob with every one of those negative emotions coming back, “No…please. Terry, it wasn’t my fault—”

The claw rips through the fabric and grasps my tongue, forcing my mouth to open even wider than the tear. I can feel the flesh on my face rip and pull apart slowly. The pain doesn’t resonate in my face, but the deepest part of my soul. The agony pulses in my chest. The tears pour down my face, flowing over the hand and filling my mouth.

I try to speak, but I am choking on water and the hand in my mouth. I cough through the tears, too scared to open my eyes. I hear the piano play a solemn song. The same one that played at Terry’s funeral.

The clapping starts up again, at the perfect tempo and on beat. Clap clap clap… clap… clap… clap… clap clap clap. But it wasn’t clapping…it was banging. Banging on something hard, like a door.

I scream with every bit of energy I have in me. My voice comes out hoarse and watery. The being removes its hands. The water is still in my mouth, but I can’t spit it out.

“Jason…”

More tears produce as I hear my name being called by the voice of an old friend.

My eyes are still shut, but the light from the outside is filling my mask. Through my eyelids, I can see a shadow approach me. I tense up as it gets closer, but relax once I feel the positive nature of the figure.

Two hands reach through the rip in the burlap and place them on either side of my face. It is comforting and healing. The tears in my cheek and cuts on my tongue seem to fade away.

“It’s okay.”

Just like that, everything is okay. I cry and cry, a tsunami of tears filling the burlap. It is like the cloth is waterproof, because the tears seem to not soak into it. The water rises, and though the hands feel safe, I can’t breathe. The water keeps rising as I keep crying.

I know I deserve this, so I don’t struggle. The water is right at my nose, but I lean into the hands that hold my face. Before the water reaches my eyes, I open them. I try to look into the light, but Terry’s face is blocking the view. He smiles knowingly, and everything fades.

I swing up, water all over me, coughing and sputtering.

“Woah! What the hell man. You good?” I look up and see Daniel standing over me.

I look around and see everyone else staring at me, in wonder and slight fear. My hand goes up to my mouth and it feels fine. I look down and see I am wearing my normal clothes, but they are drenched in water.

“What happened?” Is all I can push out. The exhaustion I feel is immense.

“Well we did the ritual. Then we poured water in your mouth to see what would happen,” he laughs, but his face reads something else. It seems like him and the other guys aren’t saying something.

“I almost drowned! Why would you do that?”

“I don’t know.. I was just trying to mess with you I guess,” he rubs the back of his head, seemingly ashamed.

“Whatever, man. Well, did I do anything weird?” I am worried I said something that I really don’t want to have to explain.

Silence fills the room, but it isn’t the sinister silence from my dream, it is that of heavy sorrow and regret.

“Well… I mean you cried and called out…Terry,” Luke looks away as he speaks.

There are only five of us in the room, but with the amount of discomfort and level of tension you’d expect there was a crowd of people.

“I don’t really remember anything,” I lie. I don’t want to talk about it, and I am tired. Maybe I will later, right now just isn’t a good time.

Everyone nods, properly reading the situation. We stop playing the game and put on a movie. No one speaks, but we are all thinking about the same thing: Terry and that stupid prank we played on him.

As we face the tv, I listen to the rain. It sounds like applause. It brings me to that night 3 years ago. I don’t linger in that area of my brain for too long. It just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, and the guilt is still massive after all this time.

I drift away as I focus on the sound of rain hitting the pavement. I tense up before I fall asleep, scared that I will return to that…place. But, then I hear, “It’s okay,” echoing through my mind and I know that I am protected.
