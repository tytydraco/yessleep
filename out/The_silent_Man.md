Quick take cover, as you’re reading this he probably knows about you and your location, who? You ask? The silent Man, he comes after anyone and everyone who knows about him, I don’t have much time probably 5-10 minutes at most but I just want to tell you to run, hide, and try not to get caught, he or “it” isn’t human obviously but it’s not an entity either, just a very frugal and creepy smile, with eyes of blood, those eyes could make anyone go insane with just one look..

I’m telling you keep reading once you take your eyes of off this post you will start hearing things at first just some footsteps but then you’ll hear glass moving doors opening and at the very last deep breaths and a “Hello” then it’s over for you, also the reason they call him “The Silent Man” is because his victims are silent, whenever he kills then they don’t make a sound, yes they are in terrible pain and agony, but they can’t make any noise they knock something down? It doesn’t make noise nothing does when you are in its presence. But I’ll tell you how to try to escape it no one hasn’t truly escaped him other than Chinao drown but that’s because he disappeared after the occurrence

Anyways, the first step to not get caught easily is to hide, somewhere good don’t hide in a closet or under your bed, he looks there first but hide somewhere disturbing somewhere that you might get hurt trying to fit in but it might mean you survive, people have tried hiding under their beds or even in their attics but they’ve all died, they’ve been mangled terrible, their bodies looked like the victims were skinned, then burned alive and eaten? These people had chunks missing from them and around the chunks they were cooked, fully cooked like a stake, it was quite a sight to see.

This thing man or entity won’t leave you after you are dead he’ll even eat you? Or maybe something else consumes the dead bodies, anyways step 2 is to breathe as little as possible and stay calm, I know it sounds impossible but if you want to survive you have to, it might be difficult but it’ll be worth it in the end, people who haven’t done that have also died, differently though, they weren’t mangled or skinned or eaten or even burned, they were decapitated, but also cooked from where the head was missing it was quite weird indeed, even the eyes were left on the floor, I guess whatever ate these victims it had choices, it prefer things because the ears were also left, thrown into the floor it was all bloody too, quite disturbing but I’ve seen worse in my life, wish I hadn’t

The last way to hopefully not get killed brutally by this thing known as The Silent Man make sure you are home alone, and Silent, if their is another person in the house it’s over for you he’ll kill them first and wait until you leave your spot and find that person you will make a noise wether you mean to or not, and that’s when he will strike you, wether it’s decapitating you, burning you alive, skinning you, torturing you, or whatever comes to its wretched horrid mind, it’ll make sure you experience pain at its finest and make you regret anything and everything you’ve done wrong, he won’t stop there, some people that have been struck by him haven’t died right away, which means for however long they’ve lived after that they have endured and went through so much pain that the human body can’t even comprehend they have suffered more than anyone else

I mean that is it’s goal to make each and every human being suffer as much as possible to make them regret their mistakes to make them cry, to see them shatter to see the fear in their eyes to feed off of it, he is truly crazy and there will never be a way to actually stop it or survive him, good luck though, I’ve informed him about your location, you shouldn’t have kept reading…
