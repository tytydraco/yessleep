It was late at night when I pulled up to the property, buried deep in a forest of skeleton-bare trees.  My headlights had been off for a while, and I quieted the engine’s rumble with a backwards twist of the key in the ignition.  Once the car was still, I breathed a sigh of relief.  No lights were turning on, no people were waking up inside the house.  

My prey had not noticed me yet.  

I opened the driver’s side door of my truck, keeping the decibels low as I closed it shut behind me again.  The cabin lights were rigged to stay dim, and I felt secure in the shadows by the gravel road.  There were no cars along this stretch, but still, I had pulled the truck far onto the grass, tucking it into the darkness of the trees.  

I strapped two pistols to my waist and one on my ankle, slinging the lightweight assault rifle across my back for long range.  I wasn’t anticipating a fight, but it was always good to be prepared.  

The sickle moon overhead provided a sparse glimmer of light as I stepped into the forest and began to move silently through the trees.  I’d done this so many times that my feet didn’t make a sound as I walked.  

When you’ve been hunting the most dangerous game in the world for twenty years, you learn to be stealthy.  

There’s nothing worse than being caught in the act when you’re trying to kill someone.  

Making my way through the last section of forest, I considered the gunshot scars and old knife wounds which decorated my skin.  Wincing, I couldn’t help but remember the worst of them - a twenty-two millimeter to my side which had ping-ponged around my thoracic cavity, doing a multitude of damages.

I tried my best not to think about how much longer I would have to do this for.  How many more people I would have to kill before I could finally rest.  Before I could finally retire and be free of this madness.  But the people I work for will never allow that while I’m still healthy, and while I’m still in my prime.  I would need a lot of money to escape permanently, and to disappear completely from their grasp.     

The lights up ahead broke me from my bad thoughts as I emerged from the forest and saw the target’s house was very close now.  

Most times a man like this would own a dog, something big and terrifying, to scare away intruders.  A lot of my victims seemed to sense death coming for them long before it arrived, and they prepared for this by purchasing assault rifles and claymores, pistols and grenades, pitbulls and Doberman pinschers.

But my client had insisted this man was peaceful and innocent.  

He was an elderly gentleman who lived alone, the anonymous voice on the phone had told me, insisting on sending the money by wire and never meeting face-to-face - paying an exorbitant surcharge for the privilege of anonymity.  

The victim didn’t have any family.  He would be asleep in his bed by the time I arrived, and I would be in and out in ten minutes or less.  

Easy money.

That was the client’s promise, and my own research had confirmed all of this as well.  After tailing the man for a week, I was confident he was at home, in his small house, sleeping quietly in his bed at this hour of the night.  

I was about to pull out my lockpick kit when I decided to try the door knob instead.  Amazingly, it turned in my hand, letting out a small, rusted squeak.  

The old bastard was just as trusting as they’d said.  

Stepping inside the little house, I took my pistol from its holster and checked that the safety was off.  There was one in the chamber ready to fire at all times, and today was no exception.  

Something felt off, though.  My instincts were telling me to run, for reasons I couldn’t understand.  

The house was too quiet, too still.  

I realized there was no noise coming from the refrigerator in the kitchen.  As if it had been unplugged.  

But why would someone unplug their fridge?

The entire house was deathly silent.  Usually there would be a computer humming, a ceiling fan spinning, or a furnace blowing air through the vents.  But this place was quiet as a catacomb.  

I told myself I was being foolish.  The old man was probably an eccentric who took out his fuses overnight, or maybe his power had been shut off by the city for non-payment.  Whatever the case was, I had a job to do.  

Pressing forward, I went through the stale-smelling kitchen, past a dark entrance to the run-down living room on my right.  A stained couch and a ragged recliner could be seen inside, positioned in front of a television with bent rabbit ears on top.  

Slowly pushing open the bedroom door, I stepped inside.  

There was a shape on the bed which looked like a man, but wasn’t.  My keen eyes immediately saw that the normal rise and fall of the chest was absent - the man’s skin pale and plastic-looking.  

It was a dummy, I realized too late.  The blank white face of it was expressionless and stared up at the ceiling as I gasped and my heart skipped a beat in my chest.  

I’d been tricked.  This was a trap. 

A hissing sound began to come from all around me, and I noticed a mist was coming through the vents now, smelling of chemicals.  

My head began to spin as I crumpled to the floor, and the last thing I remembered was feeling as if the entire house were moving, like it had been picked up and placed on a tractor trailer, and was being driven towards the highway.  

And then the world became a veil of total darkness for a while.  A heavy, black curtain made of velvet which rested over my eyes and told me to sleep.    

\*

I woke up on a beach, confused and nauseated, my head spinning viciously, causing me to vomit into the sand beside me.  After a while, I managed to focus on a single spot in the distance long enough to get my vision to settle, and eventually stood to my feet with an effort.    

My eyes took in the surroundings with a sense of surreal fascination.  

Palm trees.  Tropical birds.  Surf and sand with jagged rocky shards breaking through the whitecaps.  

This had to be a dream.  

The sun was blazing in the sky overhead and the ocean was glaring at me, a headache booming in my skull like an overinflated balloon about to burst.  Sand was clinging to my skin everywhere and I looked at it numbly.  

How the hell did I get here?

But then I remembered the dummy in the bed and the gas coming from the vents.  The feeling of being driven towards the highway, like a pig in the back of a truck, headed for the slaughterhouse.  

I’d been abducted.  But for what purpose? 

I realized my feet were hurting terribly.  Worse than any pain I’d ever felt before in my life.  

The sand beneath me wasn’t sand at all, but some sort of crushed glass.  My body had been numb from whatever drugs they’d fed me and I hadn’t noticed the stabbing pain in my soles until now.  

Suddenly I felt the agony of it digging and cutting my skin, and saw my feet were bleeding and glittering with jagged pieces of it wedged into my flesh.  

A sharp intake of air hissed out between my lips involuntarily - the closest sound I ever made to acknowledging pain - and I reached down to brush the glass from my feet.  It pierced into my fingers instead, slicing the pads with paper-fine cuts.  

“What the hell is this place?” I asked no one in particular as I began to stumble from the beach towards the trees, off-balance from whatever I’d been gassed with. 

As if to answer my question, an enormous semi-transparent dome appeared overhead, encompassing the island.  And then a face filled the sky, blocking out the clouds and the sun.  Like a deity, it was a thousand feet tall, and it took me a few moments to take it all in.  

It was a man with gray hair and a friendly smile.

“Hello, and welcome to the island,” he said kindly.  “My apologies for taking you all from your busy schedules, but I’m quite sure you will be glad I did once I explain.  It is my great pleasure to inform you all that you have been chosen for a very special event.  Consider it the World Cup of Professional Killing.  I like to call it - The Deadliest Game.”

He paused for a few seconds as if he had made a joke and were waiting for me to laugh.  But then he scowled and continued.  

“Each of you have been selected because of your particular skill set.  That skillset being murder.  There are twenty of you on this island.  I have looked into your backgrounds extensively and I understand you are the best of the best at what you do.  Killing people.”

This made me pause, as I realized suddenly that I was not alone.  This psychopath kidnapped a bunch of people and dropped us all on a private island.

I looked around, trying to spot another person, but could see no one.  It occurred to me suddenly that if I did spot someone, they might not be friendly.  Twenty MURDERERS were placed on this island, after all.  Not ordinary people.  The man had just said it himself.  

I felt very exposed on the beach, and began to run towards cover.  There was a forest further inland, and I sprinted towards it, wincing at the pain in my feet with each step, driving the broken glass in further and further.

There was a sound of running water up ahead and I moved in that direction, thinking I could use the water to rinse out the glass in my feet.  

“Jackson Triggs,” the man announced overhead, continuing his speech, and his face disappeared, showing another man’s profile picture.  “Navy Seal Squad Six Unit Commander.  Trained sniper and close quarters combat expert.  Survivalist and Iron Man competitor during his off-time.  My money is on you, Mr. Triggs, but some others are betting against the favorite, so be careful.  You never know when one of your rivals might receive a gift from one of their benefactors.”

You gotta be kidding me, I thought to myself.  What the hell is this now, The Fucking Hunger Games?  Benefactors?  Gifts?  Rivals?  Was Jennifer Lawrence going to pop out of the trees and shoot me with a bow and arrow?

The image in the sky changed again to reveal a woman with a stern, determined look on her face.  She was dressed in a military uniform that I recognized as belonging to the Green Berets.  The man’s voice began describing her training and battle history in terrifying detail and I realized I was in serious trouble.  These people were no joke, even if this whole thing felt like a bad YA novel.  

One by one he described my fellow combatants until reaching my name at the end.  He described me with a few cursory sentences, making me feel small compared to my competition.  

It struck me that I was the underdog, not the favorite.  

“There is only one rule for all of you participating in my little game,” the man in the sky continued.  “The last person alive gets to leave.  They will also receive a handsome reward for their efforts.  Enough money so that you will never have to work again in your life.  One hundred million dollars.”

My legs froze mid-stride. I had been walking deeper into the jungle when I heard those words and stopped.  

Was he serious?  A hundred million dollars?  

People in my line of work kill for far less than that. 

“Oh, and one last thing,” the man’s voice said from all around, like thunder booming in the sky.  “The perimeters of my playground will begin to shrink in exactly one hour.  By how much, you’ll have to wait and see.  The point is, you better not find yourself on the wrong side of the playground fence, or you’ll be punished quite severely.  That is to say you’ll be killed by drones with sidewinder missiles.  Ta ta!  Have fun, children!  And don’t be tardy!”

I started running.  Despite the fact that my shoes had been taken and I was walking on what felt like shards of broken glass, I had to move quickly.  Every time I stepped on a branch or a rock I felt a lightning bolt of pain shoot up through the bottom of my feet.  A few times I tried to stop in order to dig the glass out but was unable to alleviate the pain, and only injured myself further.  

Finally I heard the sound of running water very close from up ahead, and realized it was a stream.  Approaching it carefully, I sat on a rock at the edge and washed my feet, arms, and legs, which were all covered with the glass-sand mixture.  The water turned pink and then red with my blood as I saw a million tiny cuts had been left behind by the jagged shards, the wound edges flapping in the water like fish gills as they were rinsed clean.  

A small box with a red ribbon tied around it entered my field of vision.  It was floating lazily down the stream toward me, bobbing up and down as it bounced against rocks and tumbled down each little waterfall it came across.  

When it got in front of me, I reached down and picked it up.  There was a tag hanging from the top of it which read: 

Best Wishes, 

Your Benefactor

I unwrapped the ribbon which was tied around the box and stuffed it into my pocket, to avoid leaving any tracks.  When I lifted the lid to look inside, I saw there were a few items.  

A knife in a leather sheath, a canteen, a roll of gauze, and a pair of running shoes - thirteen wide.  Exactly my size.  

Something caught my attention up on a tree to my left as I wrapped the gauze around the wounds on my soles, and put the shoes on my aching feet.  

I realized it was a woodpecker.  But this wasn’t an ordinary woodpecker.  It wasn’t pecking any wood, for one thing.  Instead, it was just watching me carefully, keeping its head perfectly still.  Its one eye was trained on me and it looked slightly hollow and glassy, like a camera.  A whirring sound came from its neck as it craned its head to observe me.  

They were watching me from all around.  Every angle was covered, like a reality TV show.  And I suddenly realized that was exactly what this was.  I was a contestant in a very expensive private game show run by the world’s richest psychopaths.  And I got the feeling this benefactor of mine wasn’t just helping me out of the kindness of his heart.  

I recalled what the man in the sky had said, the words and their meaning delayed due to the adrenaline rush of everything happening.  

My money is on you, Mr. Triggs, but some others are betting against the favorite, so be careful.  

It dawned on me that considering the amount of prize money, this “game” we were involved in was likely a betting sport for a cadre of the world’s wealthiest elites.  I couldn’t prove it, of course, but it made sense.  Being involved with the sort of people I work with, I’d heard rumors of such events, but had always dismissed them as paranoid fantasies.  

Now I knew it was true.  

There really was a World Championship of Assassination.  And I was the underdog in the newest class of twenty contestants.  

With that thought in mind, I put on the shoes, filled up the canteen with water, strapped the knife to my belt, and started moving.  Keeping my head low, I crossed the narrow creek bed and made my way deeper into the unknown forest, preparing myself mentally for the fight of my [life.](https://youtu.be/rumiJJyA2FM)
