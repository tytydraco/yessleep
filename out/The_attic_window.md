The rain had not stopped for three days when Daniel Mercer arrived in Hollow Pines. The moving van had already disappeared down the crooked street, leaving him alone with the guttural groan of the old house’s timbers. It stood at the very edge of the neighborhood, pressed against a line of dense woods that seemed to whisper even when the air was still. The realtor had called it “a place with character.” Daniel suspected character was a polite word for rot.

At first glance, Hollow Pines appeared like any other suburban enclave. Neatly trimmed hedges, smiling neighbors, mailboxes painted with cheerful colors. But when Daniel pulled his last box through the front door, he noticed the street outside was suddenly empty. Curtains trembled in the houses opposite, as though someone had just stepped back from watching him.

The house itself was oddly silent. The floors creaked beneath his feet, and every door he opened revealed a room heavy with the musty odor of abandonment. Upstairs, he found three bedrooms and a narrow hallway that led to a door in the ceiling, a wooden panel with a dangling cord.

The attic.

He decided not to open it that first night. Something about it felt… patient, as if it were waiting for him.

⸻

Daniel spent the following days unpacking, but he couldn’t ignore the subtle peculiarities of the neighborhood. Neighbors avoided direct conversation. Mrs. Kellerman, from two doors down, smiled too wide when she handed him a basket of bread, then whispered, “Don’t stay up late,” before walking quickly away. Children played outside, but none came near his yard. And always, always, the woods pressed close, dark and sprawling, as though eager to swallow the house whole.

At night, the sounds began.

A dragging shuffle above his bedroom ceiling. The faint thud of something heavy dropped on wooden boards. Once, he swore he heard a voice, muffled and wet, whispering directly through the plaster: Daniel.

On the fourth night, the attic door cord dangled lower than before.

⸻

By the end of the week, Daniel’s nerves frayed. He convinced himself the noises were animals. Rats, maybe raccoons. Armed with a flashlight, he pulled the cord.

The door yawned downward with a long sigh, and a ladder unfolded like a skeletal arm. A rush of cold, stale air spilled into the hallway. His flashlight beam cut into the darkness above, illuminating dust that floated like ash.

He climbed.

The attic stretched wider than he expected. The beams were warped, and insulation hung in shreds. His light swept across stacks of boxes, covered furniture, and—at the far end—a window. Small, square, perfectly clean. Unlike the grime-streaked glass of the rest of the house, this pane gleamed as though polished daily.

As Daniel approached, the temperature dropped. He saw that the window overlooked the street below, yet something about the view was wrong. The houses seemed… older. The paint was chipped, the hedges wild, the street cracked. And the children—pale, thin, staring upward—were not the same children he’d seen that afternoon. They stood perfectly still, their faces blank, eyes black pits.

Daniel stumbled back, his flashlight beam jerking. For a moment, he thought he saw someone’s reflection in the glass behind him: a man with a noose-shaped bruise around his throat. But when he spun, the attic was empty.

He fled down the ladder, slamming the attic door shut.

⸻

Over the next days, the house seemed to change. Shadows lingered in corners. Whispers crept into the walls. Sleep offered no refuge; Daniel dreamed of the attic window and the figures outside, pressing their hands to the glass, waiting.

The neighbors avoided him entirely now. He tried speaking to Mrs. Kellerman again, but she dropped her grocery bag and muttered, “You opened it. Oh, God, you opened it,” before rushing away.

One night, determined to prove to himself that he wasn’t losing his mind, Daniel set up a camera in the attic. He left it recording overnight, then checked the footage the next morning.

The tape showed the attic, still and silent. Hours passed in static darkness—until, at 3:14 a.m., the window opened by itself. A pale hand gripped the frame from outside. Another followed. Then, one by one, gaunt figures crawled through, their bodies bending unnaturally, their faces blurred as though the camera could not bear to capture them.

The final frame showed them all standing in a circle around the lens, their heads cocked in unison. The video ended there.

⸻

Terrified, Daniel barricaded the attic door with furniture. But the noises did not stop. Scratches scuttled across the ceiling. Knocks echoed from inside the walls. Sometimes he caught glimpses of faces peering at him from mirrors, faces that weren’t his own.

On the twelfth night, the barricade shifted. He heard the attic door creak open upstairs.

Daniel armed himself with a kitchen knife and crept toward the staircase. The house was utterly still, yet the air felt thick, pressing against his chest. Step by step, he climbed until he reached the landing.

The attic ladder was down again.

A faint glow spilled from above, as though the window were lit by some unnatural moon. And then came the voices—soft, coaxing, dozens of them murmuring his name in perfect unison.

“Daniel…”

His knife trembled. His body moved against his will, pulled by a force he could not resist. He ascended the ladder once more.

⸻

The attic was alive with movement. Shadows clustered around the window, though no bodies cast them. The pane now showed not the street, but the woods—tangled and endless, their branches writhing as if in hunger.

On the floor lay an old journal, its cover cracked and brittle. Compelled, Daniel picked it up. The pages were filled with frantic scrawl, but one phrase repeated over and over:

The attic is the doorway. The window is the mouth.

Something stirred behind him. Slowly, he turned.

The man with the noose-bruised neck stood in the corner, smiling a smile too wide for his face. Behind him, shapes began to crawl through the window again, their hands stretching forward, their voices whispering promises Daniel couldn’t understand.

The last thing he remembered before the light swallowed him was the sensation of falling—not backward, not forward, but inward, as though the attic itself were folding around him.

⸻

The next morning, the neighbors noticed Daniel’s curtains drawn, his car in the driveway, but no sign of him. The house seemed darker now, the attic window gleaming like an eye that never blinked.

Children whispered that they saw someone standing there at night, watching. Sometimes it looked like Daniel. Sometimes it didn’t.

And when the “For Sale” sign went up again two weeks later, the neighbors said nothing. They simply waited, knowing someone new would come.

And the attic would be waiting
