Dogs should live forever.

I know that isn't reasonable, so I can compromise. Dogs should live for a hundred years. See how reasonable I am? Dogs belong with us, our best friends, our confidants, our protectors. Our loyal protectors.

When my little sister was a year old, before my mother and father's marriage fell apart, my mother decided she wanted a dog. Dad took care of the adoption paperwork, the supplies and all the logistics of getting the puppy. Mom named him. The shelter said the mother was a Great Dane, but they didn't know about the father and warned us that the dog could be huge. Mom named him Mouse, because she thought that would be funny. She's right of course; it is funny.

Mouse turned out to be gigantic. Mouse was the chillest dog ever. Most Great Danes are like that. When you're the size of a full grown man, you can be pretty confident nothing is going to fuck with you. With that confidence comes calm. There were times I walked Mouse down the street and some little lap dog that was more rat that dog started barking its head off at Mouse. Mouse would just ignore it. What was it going to do, bite his ankles?

Mom loved Mouse. She loved playing with him and cuddling with him. She loved training him and cleaning up after him a lot less. Dad took care of that. As Mouse got big, and he got very big very fast, Mom said she couldn't walk him anymore. Dad and I had to take care of all his walks. We didn't mind, because Mouse was the best dog ever. He never pulled on the leash or anything.

When Mom left and Esther and I were devastated, we would cuddle up on the couch next to Mouse and give him tight hugs. He licked our hair and huffed his hot breath on us. I think it was his way of saying everything would be alright. When Dad started dating my Stepmom, Becky, he was nervous to introduce her and her son Jake to Mouse. He shouldn't have been. Mouse loved them instantly. He walked right up to Jake when he met him and licked his face. Jake was delighted.

When Becky and Dad got married, we got a second dog. His name was Woodpecker. Esther picked it because when she first saw him he was chewing on a stick. We ended up just calling him Woody. Woody is smaller than Mouse. He's only eighty pounds. So, y'know, still pretty big.

Everyone says their dogs are the best dogs in the world. Now, I agree that all dogs are good dogs, but I have to say that every dog owner except my family is full of shit. There have never been better dogs than Mouse and Woody, never. That's no slight against other dogs, who are also excellent. There's just no way to be as good as Mouse and Woody.

When I was thirteen and Becky was pregnant with my youngest sibling, I took Mouse and Woody for a walk one night after Shabbat dinner. Becky felt sick and went to sleep early. Dad was getting Jake and Esther ready for bed. Being thirteen and a newly minted young man, I took it upon myself to help out and walk the dogs. It was dark outside, and Dad told me to be careful. I promised I would be, but I wasn't worried. I had two huge dogs with me, and we lived in an eruv that was also a gated community.

We walked to the end of our street and turned left. I had no particular route or destination in mind. I knew the neighborhood well, and so did the dogs. All three of us could navigate the familiar streets even in the dark. We passed neighbor after neighbor’s house. There were little pools of light under the street lamps that looked like puddles I could jump in. I didn't though, because I was thirteen and too old for such foolishness.

It was so still and quiet outside. No one was watching TV or listening to music. I was alone in the dark with my faithful companions. Some people are afraid of the dark, but I never have been, even after what happened that night. In the dark, when it's quiet, I can listen for the murmuring.

My peace was interrupted by the yowling of a cat. Mouse ignored the cat. He had no interest in them. Woody wasn't aggressive toward cats, but he had the unfortunate desire to befriend them. They did not share his desire. He tried to follow the cat, but since his leash was clipped to the front of his harness he ended up turning himself around. He looked at me with confusion, and I burst out laughing.

He took his revenge by pooping on the next lawn we passed. To be fair, that was the entire point of our walk. I collected the poop and tied the bag tight. We continued along, waiting for Mouse to feel nature's call. He did a couple streets over, but I wasn't ready to head back yet. I wasn't tired, and neither were the dogs. The night was warm and welcoming, a perfect late summer evening.

“Excuse me, young man.”

I almost jumped out of my skin when I heard someone behind me speak up. I turned around. I did not recognize the man who had spoken to me. That was odd, because we knew almost all of our neighbors, and a security guard monitored the only entrance to the community. It wasn't like random people could just wander in through the gate.

“I didn't mean to startle you.”
Woody sat down on my feet. He often did that when we encountered someone he didn't know. It was a protective gesture. Mouse stayed standing and stared at the man with his huge brown eyes. “I was wondering if you could help me.”

“I don't know you.”

The man nodded. “I'm sure your mother taught you not to talk to strangers.”

As a matter of fact, she never did. Mom loves talking to strangers. She calls it one of life's great pleasures. Dad isn't such a fan though.

“I'm staying with the Rosens. I'm Debby’s cousin. I needed some fresh air and went for a walk, but I got lost. You must think me very foolish.”

I did know Debby Rosen. She was a nice fat middle-aged mom whose kids were just a smidge too old to want to hang out with me. She gave me a big hug at my Bar Mitzvah and said I read Torah better than she'd ever heard before. She says that at everyone's Bar Mitzvah, but it's still nice. She has cousins, I'm sure. She has an uncle that she says can predict the weather with his arthritis. Presumably he has kids, and presumably they are Debby's cousins.

The thing is, this man didn't look like Debby Rosen’s cousin. I don't just mean that they didn't have similar features, although they didn't. Not everyone looks like their cousins, after all. No one thinks I look particularly like my cousins.

Debby has red undertones to her skin, and thick dark curls. Debby is short and plump. Most of all, Debby has a face that always looks like it's smiling, even when she wears one of her infrequent frowns. This man was pale like his skin had been bleached. There were no undertones to him, warm or cool. He was tall and lanky. His face had neither smile lines nor laugh lines, but it had lines, many lines.

“Can you help me get back to Debby's house?”

I could, of course. I knew exactly how to get there. She didn't live far away, either, just one block up and one over. In fact, if I started back home, I would walk right by Debby’s house on the way. “No, sorry. I don't know where she lives.”

The look the man gave me made it clear he knew I was lying. “Very well,” he said. “I'll just keep looking.”

I nodded. Then I realized I was stuck. I could go home, but that would mean walking past the man. I could go further away, but that would mean I would eventually need to turn around and go back in his direction. I took the second option. Maybe by the time I needed to turn around the man would have found Debby's house on his own.

“Come on Mouse. Come on Woody.” They obeyed me as I resumed our walk.

I wasn't expecting the man to follow me.

I looked over my shoulder at him. He ambled along at a slow pace, reading the numbers on every house he passed. He didn't look at me, but when I turned left, so did he. My heart began beating away at my chest, and I felt like I was going to throw up. I wanted to tell him to stop following me, but I was afraid if I called him out on it he would stop pretending that his path mirrored mine by coincidence.

The solution that I was embarrassed I didn't come up with right away was of course to just knock on a neighbor's door. I walked up Sammy Kane’s driveway and knocked on his door. Mouse and Woody sat in front of the door, intrigued by the aberration in our normal walking routine. The man reached the end of Sammy's driveway and stood there, watching me. I knocked harder and felt humiliated as I started to cry. The man took a step up the driveway.

“Mr. Kane! Mr. Kane, open up! It's Reuben! Mr. Kane, open the door!” The man continued up the driveway, his pace slow and measured. He was in no hurry. It was as if he knew Sammy wouldn't answer the door.

Woody started barking at the door. He was confused as to why I was pounding at the door. I was glad he was barking. It was rude to wake up the neighbors, but I didn't care. I just wanted the door to open. I dropped the two bags of dog poop and began to bang on the door with both hands.
Mouse turned to face the man. He did something he never, ever did. He'd never done it before that night, and he never did it after. He growled. He showed the man his teeth. Mouse was a massive, massive dog, and he had huge sharp teeth, but the man didn't care. He just laughed.

I pounded on the door hard enough to shake it in its frame. I don't care how deep the Kane family sleeps, one of them should have heard me and woken up. “Mr. Kane! Mr. Kane! Open the door! There's a man out here, and he's going to get me!”

I didn't look over my shoulder. I didn't want to see how far up the driveway the man was. Mouse pulled back on his haunches as though he was preparing to pounce. I dropped down to my knees and wrapped my arms around Woody, who was still barking. I started to sob. I felt the air displacement of Mouse jumping.

I heard Mouse whimper, and then I had to look. Mouse lying on the porch. His mouth was bloody and sizzling. His jowls were burning, like they'd been dipped in acid. The man stood over me, his neck gushing blood. The wound did not seem to perturb him.

“Leave me alone,” I wailed.

“You are a very rude little boy. I asked you for assistance, and you denied it. Not only that, you lied to me.”

“You- you lied first,” I choked out between sobs. “You aren't- aren't Debby's cousin. You're- you're-” I didn't know what he was. I still don't.

Mouse got to his feet. He was in pain, that was obvious. He grabbed the man's calves in his massive jaws and shook his head. The blood sizzled and popped like frying oil as it ate through the skin around Mouse's mouth. Mouse whined in agony, but he refused to let go. The man, meanwhile, seemed to feel no discomfort from Mouse's enormous jaws crushing his leg. His expression was one of exasperation.

“Let go, you stupid mutt.” He tried to shove Mouse away, but Mouse kept shaking his head. The man should have toppled to the ground, but he didn't. He kept his feet. He grabbed the skin of Mouse's back and tried to haul him off the ground. Mouse weighed more than my stepmom; the feat should have been impossible.

As the man lifted Mouse, Mouse refused to let go. He held on through the agony. The man couldn't keep lifting without yanking his own feet out from under him. The man stopped halfway through lifting Mouse, stuck.

Woody jumped out of my grip and landed on the man's chest. He went for the man's eyes. The man did not cry out in pain, but he screamed with rage. “I need that eye you filthy beast!” He let go of Mouse and grabbed Woody, yanking him off his face and throwing him. Woody yelped, and I ran.

I felt a pang of shame and grief to leave Mouse and Woody behind, but my fear was greater than either emotion. I ran in the direction of home. I wasn't looking where I was going, just running. It was inevitable that I would trip, and trip I did. I felt my ankle twist, and I stuck out my hands to catch myself. The asphalt scraped the skin and first layer of flesh from my hands. I wailed in agony and curled up on the ground, feeling defeated.

I don't know how long I was there before I heard people calling my name. “Reuben! Reuben!”

I recognized my father's voice among the cacophony. “Here! I'm here! Help!”

My father was there in moments. He scooped me off the ground and held me close and took me home. I'll never know if Mouse and Woody managed to fight off whatever that man was, or if they simply irritated him to the point he decided I wasn't worth the effort. I cried the entire time Becky bandaged my hands and put ice on my ankle, because even though Dad went out to find Mouse and Woody, I was sure they were gone. I was sure that man had killed them.

Dad found them down the street from Sammy Kane's house. They were hurt, bad, but they both made full recoveries. The police said the man who attacked me must have thrown acid on them, and they were lucky it didn't get in their eyes. The scars made them look scary, but there's never been anything scary about Mouse and Woody. They're good boys, the best boys.

Sammy Kane said I must have been confused and knocking on a different door, because he was awake and in his living room, reading by candlelight. He said he definitely would have heard me knock and definitely would have answered. I know he would have answered; Sammy is a good person. I don't know what that man did that kept the entire block from hearing my screams, but it definitely wasn't Sammy's fault. I also think deep down Sammy knows something happened at his house. After all, he must have found those two bags of dog poop by his door.

The police said I imagined most of what I saw because I was so scared. They said my dogs attacked the man when he tried to grab me, and he threw acid on them to get away. He said there's no way any human being would service a neck wound from a Great Dane and having his eye torn out by a mongrel as big as Woody. Dad said he believed me, but I know he just said that because I was hysterical and he didn't want to upset me. I know he thinks the police are right and I imagined most of what happened.

Debby believed me when I said the man was looking for her though. She installed extra locks on her door and refused to let her kids go out at night. She also got a Ring doorbell. They weren't as popular then as they are now, and it was something of a novelty. She called my house one Sunday and said she needed me to come over and return her son's book. I didn't have any of his books, but I went right over. I took Woody with me.

Mouse was napping on the couch, but he opened one eye as I opened the door. He saw Woody was with me and then closed his eye and went back to sleep. When I got to Debby's house she ushered me inside and sat me down in front of her computer. “Look,” she said.

I almost pissed myself. The man was staring at me through the screen. I knew it was a recording, but it still chilled my blood and sped up my heart. “When was this?” My whisper was so quiet I'm surprised she heard me.

“Last night,” she said. “Is that him?”

I nodded. “Are you going to call the police?”

“I don't think the police can do anything about this man,” she said.

I looked up at her. There were bags under her eyes, and she wore one of her rare frowns. Even the smile that was always just beneath the surface during those rare moments she wasn't smiling had been scared away. “What happened?”

She opened her mouth to answer, but then she looked at me and snapped her mouth shut. “I'll tell you when you're older,” she said. She knelt down next to Woody. She pet him and scratched behind his ears. He loved it. “Kelev tov,” she told him. “Kelev tov.” He licked her face, and she smiled again at last.

“I want to know now,” I said, but it was half-hearted. I knew she wouldn't tell me.

Mouse lived for six more years, and Woody is still going strong. This year, when I came home from school for the summer, I saw that Mouse wasn't doing good. I think he was waiting for me to get home, so I could say goodbye. I gave him so many kisses and treats and hugs. He slept in my bed every night, which meant that Esther, Jake and David often snuck into my room to sleep with Mouse. It was worth it.

He passed away while we were both sleeping. I cried like a baby that morning. We all did. Poor Woody is depressed. He's lonely now, even with all of us here. He needs a friend. I think Dad and Becky want to get another dog to comfort him, but it's too soon. We aren't ready yet.

Last night, when the sun was going down and we had maybe an hour or so until Havdalah, we all started talking about Mouse. We shared our favorite memories, and it was nice. We cried, but they were good tears.

“I'll never love another dog as much as I love Mouse and Woody,” Becky said all of a sudden. “They saved Reuben’s life.”

“Huh?” David is smart. He picks up on things a lot of six year olds wouldn't. “When?”

“When you were still a fetus,” Jake said.

“Don't call me a fetus!” David glared at him.

“No, you were,” Esther said. “You weren't born yet. Some crazy serial killer tried to kidnap Reuben. He almost killed Mouse and Woody when they defended him.”

“Let's not talk about that,” Dad said.

“They never caught him,” Jake said. “Some say he still wanders the streets, looking for unsuspecting little boys to sna-”

“Jake,” Dad said. “Enough.”

David's eyes were wide with terror. Jake cleared his throat. “Sorry, Davey,” he said. “That was years ago. He's long gone, whoever he was.”

“Remember when Mouse knocked over that bag of flour when we were gathering up all the chametz,” Esther said to change the subject.

Becky groaned and we all laughed. “His whole face was white,” Dad said, chuckling.

The mood was lifted, but I noticed that when it came time to walk Woody one last time before bed Dad insisted on doing it even after Jake volunteered. I thought about what happened as I lay in bed trying to fall asleep. Even after I attained sleep the man appeared in my dreams, stalking me in the darkness until Mouse appeared to chase him away. I was able to give him hugs and kisses again, but no treats. In my dream I wore the pajamas I had gone to sleep in, and I had foolishly neglected to stuff my pajama pockets with beef jerky.

Debby's kids have all graduated from college, and her oldest is getting married soon. I'm going to pay her a visit to congratulate her. While I'm there, I'll remind her that I'm older now. I'm ready to hear the rest of the story. I'm ready to know what my beloved canine companion truly saved me from.
