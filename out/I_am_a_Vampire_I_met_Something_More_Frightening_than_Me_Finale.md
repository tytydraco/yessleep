We tried not to let that ruin the night. We left to get food at Waffle House and attempted to regroup. Kathleen needed the most cheering up; I could tell the elf's near assault got to her. Barri did most of the work. My mind was half in it. I felt as if we were being watched the whole time. Then Kathleen spoke, and it pulled me back in.

"I just really don't want to die alone," she said.



"Hey, whoa, where's that coming from?"



"I don't know, it's just..." she paused over her words like she knew exactly what she meant but was too ashamed to say it. "When he grabbed me, I was like, 'oh my gosh, this is what everyone is talking about on TikTok, like rejecting a man and he kills you,' and I'm just like 'I'm dead'. This is it, and no one is here to even care."



"We're here," Barri added. Kathleen might as well have not heard it.



"I'm 23 years old and I've never been in a relationship," Kathleen mourned. "No one wants me and no one cares."



"We want you," I said.



"Then where were you?" she asked. That shut me down. Neither I nor Barri replied.



"I'm sorry," she said after a minute of silence. "You saved me, and I know you did, and you always look out for me. I'm just shook a bit and feeling lonely."



"Come," I said. "Let me fly you to my house. Let's find out what this guy is and how to stop him tonight."



I flew the girls to my home to search for books to determine exactly what this creature was and how to stop him. I placed both of them on the ground and hobbled inside. My leg would heal in a couple of hours, but for now, I had a limp.



My mix of confusion, fear, and insult at this attack turned into pure fury as I hobbled. Which made me even madder because I couldn't even stomp properly with one leg. I wobbled.  We journeyed in silence, the echoes of our footsteps spoke for all of us. The girls' steps were quiet and full of trepidation.



Finally, we arrived at the back of the cave where I made my home. Rows and rows of candles with dancing flames greeted us. 



The girls stopped walking.



"What?" I whipped around and barked at them, letting my frustration burst.



They were huddled together, almost holding hands.



"Please don't yell," Barri said, and she covered her ears.



"Sorry," I said. That was the first time I remember raising my voice to either of them, and the feeling twisted my stomach into knots. I stepped toward them to hug Barri. Barri always craved physical affection but she took half a step back.



"Oh," I said aloud, not wanting to make her feel awkward but because I couldn't believe it.



"No, wait, sorry, you didn't do anything. Well, you shouldn't yell, it's just--"



"You live here?" Kathleen interrupted.



Oh, what a sight they must have seen. I forget how differently we live from you. We are just a darker people in tolerance and fashion. Portraits of my ancestors - men and women - line the wall, all in traditional fashion. They sit crouched in black leather with our family's blanket on them. Their fangs bared, their weapon of choice wet, and the head of the victim of choice on the floor. There were at least 100 pictures on the walls, and many had cow heads, rabbit heads, and chicken heads. We don't eat only humans, but of course, the first pictures they saw were of my oldest ancestors, and of course, freshly cut human heads were on their portraits.



I hate that I could hear their hearts beating faster, the shuffle of their feet wanting to escape, and I saw the judgment in their eyes.



"Yes," I said to Kathleen.



They traded glances with each other and came in. That put my heart at ease.



I brought them to my library and tried to show off as little of my place as possible. My heart was at ease, but my shame had not left.



Regardless, together the three of us went through every book in the library to find out what exactly was attacking us.



"Wait, is this true?" Kathleen mocked. "Kill a vampire, get a miracle?" She quoted the unholy book.



"How would I know?" I shrugged. "I don't know, some people say we're cursed or not part of God's design or whatever."



"That would explain your taste in music," Kathleen smiled. "Drake over Kendrick is insane, especially considering--"



"It's not true."



"Whatever," Kathleen closed the book and frowned. "That's mean though. I'm sorry you had to read that; that can't be nice to hear about yourself."



I shrugged. That level of intimacy made me awkward. It was quite unpleasant to read honestly. Especially since I knew no other vampires, and some days I frankly didn't like myself, so I thought, what if the books were right? What if we were cursed?



"Hey, did you hear me?" Kathleen rubbed my back with the gentleness a good friend shows. "I'm really glad we're friends."



"Same!" Barri said as she read a book and then waved it in the air. "I found something about him!"



We gathered around, and she summarized the passage.



"It looks like he's a Lusting Elf. The Lusting Elf is an abomination half-elf, half-demon. It doesn't understand any concept other than greed. The Lusting Elf sees his life purpose is to have everything his mind desires. He'd rather die than not have his lust satisfied. He or his friends will approach a target three times to get what he wants, and if he is denied all three times, he's gone."



"Okay, great, so we just have to prepare for him three more times, and then we're set," I said, still anxious about the situation. "Let's go home."



I dropped Kathleen off last and offered to sleep on her couch to help watch over her. I still felt that creeping feeling that someone was watching us. I did leave her side, though, because I smelled the blood of something non-human. I wish I hadn't; this is what happened.



At perhaps 2 am, while I flew down the streets chasing what I believed could be the man in the plaid suit based on the smell of his blood, something entered Kathleen's house.



This something cracked Kathleen's bedroom door open. The heart-stopping groan of the door roused her from her dream. She had enough time to let out half a gasp before she shut her mouth.



Something entered her room and slammed the door. It didn't bother with silence.



"Are you cold?" the thing whispered. Its voice was deep, adult, and male. Its outline barely visible in the room. The only light the blinds allowed was a small thread from the streetlamps outside.



"Huh, what? What?" Kathleen whispered.



"Are you cold? You have a weighted blanket, so you're either cold or lonely?"



"Are you, um, the guy from the bar?"



"Him? Oh no, not me," it seemed confused at the question. “He sent me though.”



"Please leave."



"Oh, well, can't do that. You should have asked me to tell you what I want. I could have done that."



"What do you want?" she said and reached for her phone in the darkness.



"Please don't do that! Please don't move!" the thing ordered and took three scratching steps forward, directly toward her bed.



"Sorry!"



It didn't reply. It only breathed, loud breaths through its mouth, she assumed. Unsure of what the silence meant, Kathleen wiggled her feet beneath the bed.



CRASH



Her lamp exploded in a scream. By force or by magic, she heard the clatter and the resulting drizzling of shrapnel on her floor. Kathleen screamed.



"I said don't move!" the thing in the dark shouted.



"I'm sorry," Kathleen sobbed, open and raw. She was terrified, and there was nothing she needed to hold back.



"You have so many blankets on. Are you lonely or are you cold?"



"I'm lonely."

"What do you want other than for me to go away?"

"Someone to hold me and tell me this isn't happening." Her words morphed into pitiful, childish blabber. The thing did not comment on that. It walked closer and closer still, until it bumped into the front of her bed.



Thump.



The bed said, and Kathleen did not respond. She could not respond.



"Do you want to ask me what I want again?" the thing whispered.



Kathleen flinched in an attempt to nod her head and then remembered he demanded stillness.



"What do you want?"



The thing in the dark thumped twice against the bed frame,



Thud.



Thud.



Then it climbed into the bed. With the gentleness and absence of an Arizona breeze, it pulled back the covers to reveal her toes. The thing in the dark grabbed Kathleen's toe, its hands small, baby-like, perhaps the hands of a one-year-old. Kathleen loved children.



"Before I begin," the thing said. "I must ask you, do you still deny the advances of my friend? He is why I am here, to get you to accept him. Will you accept him as your master?"

"No, but we can--" she cried.

"Then enough," he said. "You won't be lonely much longer. I am a cousin to the Changeling. I am sort of a cuckoo. I will place my body inside of you from my head to the soles of my feet, and I will nest there. You will never give birth to anything that lives, and the babies who die (if you selfishly choose to have them) shall be denied heaven and hell; their souls shall journey to be slaves for all eternity in the other world."



And then the strange creature parted her legs.



And that is where I come in, having smelled the blood of another inhuman. I flew back and crashed through Kathleen's window. I grabbed the thing by its neck and beat its head against the floor.



CRACK



CRACK



CRACK



I eagerly lapped up the blood, relishing my revenge and the opportunity to feast on something great. But the texture, the flavor, the way it oozed - this was not what the man in the plaid shirt's blood would be like. Mouth covered in blood and senses returning, I turned on the lights to see Kathleen huddled under covers, shaking, sweating, and crying.



"Where were you?" she asked. "I needed you here. I needed you with me. Protecting me!"



She would say she accepted my apology and understood later, but that night she told me to get out of her house. No more attacks happened for weeks, and things went back to normal-ish.



Until we went out to a lesbian bar.

When I said there was a 50% chance Barri didn't know what was going on, I meant it. So, perhaps we shouldn't have left her alone at the Lesbian bar.



Believe it or not, it was my decision to go there. Hear me out, I was a big Drake fan, and there was a certain song everyone was playing that summer that ran, dissing him. You might have heard it; it was called "Not Like Us."

That song.



It played everywhere, multiple times a night. So, of course, I went to the one spot in town it would never play, or so I thought.



Long story short, it did play. The song played, and Barri proved again why she was the best dancer out of all of us.



A crowd of lesbians formed around her, enamored, cheering, and throwing back drinks as Barri crip-walked in a circle to the song. For those that don't know, a crip walk is a dance that came from the Crip gang it’s a complicated side-shuffle that impresses at a party.



Barri (although definitely not a crip) had mastered it. I believe she liked dancing because it was so simple. Do good moves, people applaud. Unlike relationships and social dynamics where there were so many lies and half-truths that confused Barri, Barri was too authentic to understand that, and I loved her for it.



She bore her soul as she danced, slight smiles popping out as she moved. She was so controlled, every movement purposeful. No step wasted. Honest. When she got bored, she simply freestyled until the song called for her to crip walk again.



She was extraordinary and in her element. I felt it was safe to go to the DJ and bribe her to play Drake while Kathleen somehow found the only other single straight male to talk to.



The song switched to something more slow and intimate, perhaps "Drunk in Love." Feeling confident and proud of herself, with one finger, Barri pointed to the crowd and beckoned for someone to dance with her, a slender pixie-cut red-haired girl.



In the flashing lights, Barri grinded on the girl as Beyoncé serenaded Jay-Z. Confidence growing and alcohol taking effect, Barri sang with Beyoncé and bellowed the chorus and name of the song; "Drunk in Love." Their hips matched in sync, and Barri turned her head so her eyes could see who she sang to as they danced to the tunes of two American legends.



As the song ended, Barri said her goodbyes to her audience.



Barri looked for us post-song, exhausted but flattered by the love. As Barri walked through the crowd, she was confronted by the aforementioned lesbian.



"Honey, you did so good," she said and grabbed Barri by both cheeks and kissed her on the lips.



"Eeeh," Barri screamed. She tended to scream like an anime character at times.



"What?" the strange woman said. Her red lip gloss smudged.



Barri motioned to wipe her mouth but froze, debating if that would be rude or not. She decided it was and put her hand down.



"Like, whoa," Barri said, "You can't just be kissing people." She said and pounded away to the bar. Cautious of the women who Barri thought still stared at her.



At the bar, she was served by a yellow-eyed woman with a muscular frame, almost like a rugby player. The gaze of the bartender was predatory. Barri's blood chilled. Her mind screamed at her to run away to find us. This woman was too big, too strong; if this one reached out, she couldn't escape her. 

The bartender lost interest in her and cleaned a cup.

 Oh, it appeared Barri had misread signals again. She mused over the moment and the previous one and dipped into depression. 

She could have sworn the bartender woman was looking at her strangely.

She didn't want to hurt the red-head woman's feelings, she thought. She was just dancing. Was it her fault?



Like Kathleen, she had been hurt a lot and would prefer not to give anyone else that feeling. But she did, she felt somehow she had led on that girl. Her depression spoke to her.



Lost in self-doubt I imagine Barri didn't notice the bartender's expression change. How the bartender's massive frame could not be caught in any mirror. How as far as the rest of the bar was concerned this bartender didn't exist. 

No, Barri stewed in self-hatred.

Why couldn't she get this? Why couldn't she get people? She was trying to be good, trying to understand people, and she sucked. She sucked. She failed. She got confused. That's all she was, all she'd ever be.



"Oh, honey," the disinterested bartender said to her, seeming very interested in her again, too interested, frighteningly interested in her as if she was fresh meat to a starving man. Her eyes ate up Barri's body, her smile bent beyond normality, and she leaped over the bar counter.



Barri leaped away, unsure of what she should do now. No one addressed the menacing bartender.



"They. Can't. See me. Swee-tie!" the bartender sang. "It's just me and you. I'm glad your thoughts were so loud, you're telling me exactly what to do."

The bartender was massive, a pale woman that could pass for a Viking. The folds and folds of wrinkles on her face aged her beyond this decade.

"I usually have to dig and dig and dig to find out how to play with one's mind, but you were shouting it," the large woman announced. "Before I begin, quick question, will you submit to my friend the elf?"

Barri sprinted away.

"I'll take that as no," she shouted and tackled Barri. "Let's see how many days you'll say no."



I still do not know what creature this was.



It was both weightless and held so much mass it made Barri fall to her knees. The woman creature wrapped around Barri like a koala and put her somehow translucent hand in her skull and began to play.



She made the world black and white and then purple and green, and then settling on only orange and yellow. She switched Barri's vocal motor functions so, although she wanted to scream, it came out a whisper.



Scared and unable to speak, Barri ran out of the club. Then the thing that played in her skull spoke only to her. "Your want was so loud," she said. "To be understood, and to understand. Oh, I heard your request and it shall be denied."



The woman on top of her disappeared in weight and vision, and yet Barri could still feel her crawling in her head. The monster played a game of mismatch with the words in her brain. She felt herself forgetting the right words - "Hello, goodbye, thank you, my name is, help" - all vanished.



When to smile and when to frown slipped through her mind. How to get home and how to speak vanished.



Barri knew how to sit, she knew how to cry. So she did. Her mouth turned into horrible and painful amalgamations as she tried to frown.



And yet, someone still had mercy on her. 



"Hey, honey, are you okay?" a group of girls asked as she cried on the sidewalk.



"No, no, I want to go home," is what Barri wanted to say, but her mind couldn't form the words. Instead, she screamed. The girls ran away. This didn't stop her screaming. She screamed until her voice cracked into oblivion.



The streets eyed Barri with suspicion and disgust. Barri felt this and mourned how she wasn't able to explain her case. She couldn't explain that she didn't have control.



The girls ran away from Barri, and Barri ran away from the world, trying to find us. But her brain jumbled all of them together, and for three days, she lived as a vagrant, as a homeless woman in a dangerous city that cared for no one.



When we found her, she was shivering in the rain under newspapers beside a garbage dump. Her bright dress from three nights ago was gone. Instead, she wore stained brown sweats and an oversized jacket. I do not know what happened to her in the three days. She never found the words to explain it.



I didn't want the words anyway; I wanted revenge. The monster could not hide itself from me. It saw I saw her and leaped from Barri. I leaped on it and plunged my teeth into its neck. Cold silver blood sprouted from it and wet my face in vengeful satisfaction. With three mighty punches, she unfortunately got me off of her. It grew strange batish wings and flew into the sky.



"I will kill her," I said to them, and that is what I set off to do.



I was so mad it was comical in a way. This creature, this thing, really thought it could escape me. I had bitten into its flesh. There was nowhere it could go that I wouldn't find it. It's a shame too because it blended so well as a human before me.



She had a job.

I cut off all the power in her office and stormed through the darkness, like the true creature of the night I was. I'm sure I gave nightmares to everyone, but again, she escaped me.



She had a boyfriend.

I came from under their bed like the boogeyman. I knocked him unconscious, and she escaped.



She had a son.

I suppose at her ex-husband's house. She thought hiding behind the boy would be enough to save her. She thought I could not be so monstrous as to whisk her away in front of her child, but I was one, and that is what I did.



Once in my home, I threw her on the ground and got to work. I only asked once where the elf was. She said she didn't know, as expected. I got to work. Knives, ropes, and tools of the trade of torture brought the answer out in 7 sleepless days. She was rewarded with a broken neck.



She gave me an address to some apartment complex. It could have been a lie, I suppose, but my anger had not subsided. I decided blood must be shed.



I flew to the third floor of that apartment and crashed through. Glass shattered, and I pounced on a chair I thought was him. It crushed under my weight and split under my claws, but it was not him. I wanted blood.

I wanted a battle and was met with silence. That made my blood run still. The living room was empty, but I could hear stirring outside the door and in the hallway. I didn't move. My fear of this man was coming back to me. I looked at a mahogany door leading to the bedroom and knew that's where he would be waiting for me.

I did not want to go, fear still shackled me. Unfortunately, I had no choice. This needed to end tonight.



I pulled open the door and saw him dead!



My revenge was again denied! I was shamed. This is not something a vampire does. This is not something a vampire can tolerate. To be denied their vengeance. I didn't even think I'd care. I never knew most of my family, only my mother, and yet I felt all of their long-gone eyes on me. By not killing him, I failed them.



I shook the dead body and bit into its flesh to taste only dried blood. I spit it on his face and screamed. Someone knocked on the door. My noise had brought onlookers; I had to go. Still full of rage, I grabbed the paper off the bed and read it.



"Everyone has a cost, Son of the Count. Don't blame me. You just have to remind mortals that they are mortals and they act as cruel as a mortal can be."



"Nonsense," I yelled and cursed the letter in the ancient tongue my mom taught me. I had not used it since her death. I tore up the note and spit on it for good measure.

Three attempts... I realized as I flew away. Three attempts, and then he'd rather die. The first attempt was that night. The second was to attack Kathleen, and the third was to attack Barri. He was already gone.



It was already the weekend again, and we all decided to go out. Disappointed in myself for not getting revenge as my ancestors would have, I didn't mention he was dead yet. I needed a couple of drinks first to swallow my pride.



That night we pre-gamed, I foolishly believed things had gone back to normal. In my mind, everything had reset. I was even playing Drake. I showed them one of his songs post-beef, and we pre-gamed and drank until the world shook, and I was singing my heart out and swinging my hips like I was a Brazilian at Carnival.



Thirty-six in the chest, okay

Twenty-eight in the waist, okay

Forty-six in the hips, come swing my way

Swing my way, drop for me, sing for me

Bruk your back and bend up your knee

Badmind gyal can't friend up with me, no



As I danced, I noticed I still had dried blood on my nails. The blood from her boyfriend, no doubt. It seemed I had become the monster I never knew myself to be, and was that such a bad thing? It was for the safety of my best friends after all.



As the night wore on, dread drenched me; not even my dry martinis could make the feeling leave. Everything at our pre-game was forced, the laughs, the jokes, and even the feeling of warmth that a chosen family provides.

Why was I scared? I was only with my friends, and I never needed to be scared when I was with them.



"Can you help me zip up my dress?" Kathleen asked from her bathroom. Her voice came out flat, rehearsed.



Drunk and wobbly, I wandered to her room.



Where was Barri? Why was there tension in the air? Why was I so scared I found it hard to breathe? I heard myself pump out heavy breaths.

"Kathleen?" I called. One step outside of the bathroom.

She said nothing but I trusted her; this was my best friend so I kept going.



Kathleen had her back to me, and in the bathroom mirror, I saw Barri behind the door with a stake. Her hands trembled and there were tears in her eyes and then it all made sense.

Time seemed to stop. My friend's betrayal - my personal Hell - froze my world. I didn't believe it; they were all I had and they didn't even want me.

Fragments of memories whipped through my head. It all made sense. The terrible, heartbreaking Lament Configuration of my life made sense.



"Everyone has a cost, Son of the Count. Don't blame me. You just have to remind mortals that they are mortals and they act as cruel as a mortal can be," the elf said in its note to me not too long ago.



Kathleen was almost cursed to not have a kid, what she wanted most. Barri was left misunderstood and homeless for three days. Like the elf said, they were faced with mortality and decided what they really wanted. They wanted a miracle, not me.

"Kill a vampire, get a miracle."

 I ran out of the room, popped out of a window, and burst into the night air.



I have found a new cave, not the home of my ancestors, somewhere to die alone.



There will be no revenge, no grand plan to dominate, nor bats haunting them to alert them of my absence. I didn't want it then, and I don't want it now. I wanted friendship, and you all have denied that from me. So, I must be alone. My mother was right, your mythology was right: blood is all that matters, and blood is what we're all seeking. Blood is what they were born to see. Blood is what I was born to chase.



There are not many of us vampires left; we will die soon. But I write this note because I am begging you, dear reader, if you happen to run into someone different from you, a little strange, and with some features that scare you - that is to say, someone who is a vampire - if they want to be your friend and treat you as a friend, please be kind to them. I have not eaten nor drank in so long. I will die in this cave, and I am so sad I will die alone.



THE END OF HIS TALE



That is the note I saw beside the dying vampire. Who am I? Don't worry about it. Pray you never need my services. I am a man who can find anything. Quite recently, I was tasked with finding this young vampire for a pair of girls who forfeited their college education (and a considerable amount of money for one year) to hire my quite expensive services. It cost five thousand for a consultation.

I am not sure what the girls want to do with him because, like vampires, humans can be both monsters and friends.

Perhaps, the girls have forfeited an impressive amount of money to bring him back to apologize and let him know he is loved.

Perhaps, the girls have forfeited an impressive amount of money so they may kill him and reap a miracle.

I don't know; that's for them to decide. I just deliver the [body.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/)
