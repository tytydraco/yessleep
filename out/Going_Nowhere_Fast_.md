I just don't understand it...I'm sitting here in my beat up car at a rest stop I don't recognize...typing this up to remain sane.  I left work at 2:30 a.m. as usual, but I still haven't made it home.  Something's not right.  This feels wrong...I feel out of place.

Everything seemed normal enough up until I stepped into the parking lot after clocking out.  That's when the unease set in.  The world fell quiet. Even quieter than it normally is at 2am.  No white noise filtering in.  No nocturnal creatures stirring about. Nothing...not a sound.

I tried to brush the strangeness off as I continued to my vehicle.  That's when the overhead lights shut off.  All the streetlights went dark simultaneously.  I instinctively pulled out my phone's flashlight.  Holding it with unstable hands I made my way to my Maxima. I could of sworn I heard a cackle in the distance.

I sat in the driver's seat a good while before switching on the ignition.  Thankfully, it started with no issue.  Except the radio...it was just static...maybe I was on edge, but I know there was more behind that static.  Some kind of sinister subliminal message permeating my mind uncontrollably.  I quickly switched it off.

As I pulled out of the lot, I noticed how empty it all was.  The streets, the trees, the entire space I found myself existing in was empty. Vacant. Lonely...The feeling was suffocating.  I rolled my windows down to find the air was still. Dead.  

I felt the need to sweat, but I couldn't.  I felt the need to scream, but I couldn't.  I felt the need to cry, but still I could not.  It was like I was a prisoner in my own body.  This felt intentional.  This felt malicious.  Mostly, this felt personal.

Driving for what felt like hours, I was internally breaking apart. I began looking for any sign of life outside my own.  It was difficult with the landscape being drenched in darkness like a weighted blanket.  Then I saw it. A boy.  Facing away from me as I drove towards the street lamp he was standing under. 

He stood there under the flickering light. Not moving. I tensed up the closer I got.  It seemed like he was always the same distance away.  It was like I would never reach him.  Until I did....oh until I did.
I wish I had never reached him...

As my eyes met the side of the boy he slowly turned his head.  His face was frozen in an expression of anguish. His lower jaw was missing, and blood continued to drip onto his one shoe.  His nose was bent upwards leaving a tear above his lip. One eye remained intact holding a perpetual sadness.  The other eye was nothing but a black socket.  That was just his face though...

My gaze escaped his, and my eyes drifted down towards his body.  His arms were bent at unnatural angles.  One of his kneecaps were inverted. Bones pierced the flesh at various places on the body.  I couldn't handle it I vomited right then and there.  Luckily most of it got out the window.

When I looked up the boy was gone, but his presence lingered. The streetlights were once again dark.  I sighed and put my head down on the steering wheel.  That's when I felt the breeze.  It was like I had woken up from a nightmare.  The streetlights came to life once again.  I saw the Rest Stop sign up ahead and decided that was my sanctuary for now.

That's where I'm at now.  Piecing this experience all together.  I know what this is about.  It's what I've been running from.  Not fast enough I suppose.  Is this universal justice or do we manifest our fate.  I'm not sure.  Either way I know this isn't over.  The floodgates have been opened.  I'm not the only one confronting my demons.  Facing my punishment.

I think it's time I go visit my son now.  Though I know we have tickets to two different final destinations.  Pulling back onto the main road, I tried to ignore the demons in the rearview...
