I live in a small town in the forests of New York State, close to Pennsylvania. The house I live in is a two-story wooden house, a bit big for just me, but I like living in the countryside. The house is pretty old, and I always have something to do, there is always something to fix. It keeps me occupied, and it makes me happy.

So, the other day I was doing some work in my basement when I got a text message. 

Hey! Can I borrow your ladder for a couple of days? /Bob

Bob is my neighbor. He's in his 60s, short and muscular. He's always up to something, and the other day he mentioned a leak on his roof. Bob and I are good neighbors, we help each other with projects, drink beer and occasionally go hunting. 

I thought about the text message, it came from a number I didn't recognize. Bob had given me his number as soon as I moved in, he said that it's always good to keep in touch with your neighbors, in case anything happens. I thought no more about it and just assumed he'd gotten a new phone number. So I replied:

Sure! Do you want me to come over with it? 

I looked at my phone, waiting for an answer, but no answer came. So, I resumed my work. After a while, I got another text:

Can you leave it outside? Dunno when I'm home. Thanks.

Weird, I thought, but Bob isn't your average neighbor, he's always been a bit strange. So, without further thoughts, I left it outside. Where we live, we can leave things unattended without them being stolen. 

The day continued as usual until bedtime. My bedroom is on the second flood, with a large window and a balcony outside. I see that Bob's truck is still not home before I close the curtains. When going to bed, I always leave them a bit apart and the window a bit open, so that fresh air can flow through during the night. 

I awoke to the sound of the curtains opening and saw a dark figure peeking at me. Then, I saw a flash, like the one your phone makes when you take a picture. I was dazzled and saw nothing, but I could hear the ladder being moved away. When I regained my vision, the figure was missing, and so was my ladder. I stood at my window watching out. Bob's truck was still missing. His house was dark, not even a porch light was lit. My heart raced, what had just happened? I rushed to the window and closed it fully. I closed the curtains and threw on some clothes. It was still in the middle of the night and the thought of what just happened made me terrified, so I called the cops.

The cops showed up after an hour or so. I saw the car from my windows, and I walked down to meet them at the porch. I told them what had happened, how I had gotten the text message and left my ladder outside, the flash I saw and the dark figure. We walked around the house to see if there had been any attempts of breaking in, or any damage done. We saw nothing, the cops walked over to Bob’s house and knocked, but no answer. They told me there wasn’t anything else they could do, but would get back to me when they had talked to Bob. When they had left, I locked my door and sat down in my couch, watching TV. 

I awoke later, and saw that it was midday. The shock from earlier had settled and my fear had been replaced with anger. I walked up to Bob’s house and knocked on the door. No answer. I took a stroll around the house to see if anything was weird. Apart from every light being turned off, there wasn’t anything to remark. Bob’s truck was still missing, but maybe he’d gotten a ride home? I thought. 

When I walked back to my house, I got the urge to check around my house, hoping to find something. Under my balcony, I found holes in the grass, probably from where the ladder had stood. The thought of Bob lurking on me made me to shiver. How can someone I’ve known for so long do this to me? Then another thought struck me and my heart almost skipped a beat. What if it wasn’t Bob who had texted me, and instead it was someone else? 

I continued to walk around my house, looking for more holes, but couldn’t find any. Bob, or whoever lurking on me, had only placed the ladder against the balcony. The balcony! The figure had stood on my balcony! My heart raced and I began to cold-sweat. I had never had any troubles out here, and I’ve lived here for 10 years. How would I sleep now, knowing that someone was after me? 

I didn’t want to call anyone and worry them, especially when they’re far away. My brothers live in the south and my parents had moved to California. I thought about calling some friends and asking if I could crash on their couch for a day or two, but now I wanted to get away, right now. I got in my truck and started to drive. After an hour of driving, my nerves were a bit calmer, but I didn’t want to sleep at home. Not for tonight. 

I stopped at a nearby motel and checked-in. One night away couldn’t hurt. The feeling of being away made me feel safer, and I slept like a log. 

A good night of sleep had calmed me and made me re-evaluate the situation. Could it have been a nightmare? I remember the flash clearly, but there weren’t any more things to remark. Apart from the holes in the ground. Could I’ve done them myself? I got in my truck and drove back home.

When I came home, Bob’s house was suspiciously dark, and his truck still missing. Before I opened the door, I felt that I wanted to check around the house. I’m glad that I did, but wish that I hadn’t. Under every window were the type of holes I had seen under the balcony. They hadn’t been there before. 

I rushed to my truck and drove away as fast as I could. I called my brother to inform him that I was on my way to him. There is over 700 miles to my closest brother, but the thought of someone making that many attempts to spy on me almost made me nauseous. 

When I was midway, I stopped for some food. I pulled up on a diner and sat down. My brother called to see how I was doing, and when I thought I’d arrive. 

On my way back to the truck, my phone rang. It was Bob, and the display showed his old number, the one he gave to me ages ago. I answered:

“Hello?”

“Hey man, how are you doing?  Why do you need to borrow my ladder? I thought you had your own?”

I froze and couldn't move. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cry, I wanted to tell Bob to get out, to get out quickly, and to get far away.

Nothing. I couldn't move my lips, not a single word came from my mouth. A single “uhh...” was the only sound I could make.

“Anyway, I left it outside as you wanted. Will you be home soon? Been a while now that I've been away. We need to watch the game and drink a few beers together.”

I couldn't respond, I didn't know what to say. Again, I made the “uhh…” sound.

“Bad reception? Well, talk to you later then, take care.”

The call ended. What did I just do? Why didn't I try to warn him? I sat down in my truck. The rearview mirror reflected my face, I was pale as a sheet. I felt a lot of things, yet I couldn't feel anything. I just drove off, and drove till I came to my brother's house.

When I arrived, it was late, and my brother greeted me with some food. I told him what had happened, everything except my conversation with Bob. I was ashamed that I hadn't said anything. 

After dinner, I went to sleep on the couch. As I closed my eyes, ready to sleep, I heard my phone get a text message. A chill went down my spine. The message was from yet another number. I opened the phone, I saw that the message was just a picture.

A picture taken through a window, with bad lighting and the flash reflecting from what seemed to be part of a window, as if the picture was taken from outside. 

There was something else on the picture, a bed, and a man sleeping in it.
