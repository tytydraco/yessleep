I went back. I'm still trying to process it all.

The night felt heavier than ever. I didn't want to come back, but I needed to talk to Sam, and I need the money. Every step I took as I entered the lobby seemed to echo louder than usual. The jingle was playing again, but this time it didn’t annoy me—it felt like a warning, an ominous reminder that something was wrong. The absence of Sam weighed heavily on me. After talking to Mr. James, I found out she left early with no call or note explaining why. I called her phone several times on my drive home, but it went straight to voicemail every time. 

"I can't come to the phone right now, leave a message or call back".

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right. She wouldn’t just leave without actually talking to me, right? I know we were coworkers, but I would like to think we've become friends through the months of working together. We've bonded over the fact Mr. James is a piece of work and have hung out frequently outside of the hotel.

The front desk was quiet when I sat down. The pile of paperwork in front of me offered an odd comfort I tried to focus on, anything to keep my mind occupied. I didn’t know how long I could keep pretending that everything was fine, that Sam wasn't missing, that the figure I had seen on the security cameras wasn’t still lurking somewhere, waiting. I glanced at the clock: 9:15 PM. My shift had barely started, and already I felt the creeping dread begin to settle in. I checked the security cameras, half-expecting to see something in the grainy footage of empty hallways. There was, but just a kid and his mother. Relief washed over me, and I started to finish the reports part of the paperwork. A little voice whispered in my head to keep calling Sam, so I did just that. I pulled out my phone, typed in her number, and hit call. 

Bzzzzz.  Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz. 

At first, I was confused. Is she in the office? No, I would have seen her when I clocked in. Did she leave her phone here? Is that why she wouldn't answer? I walked into the office to find the location of the buzzing.

Bzzzzz.  Bzzzzz. Bzzzzz.

My confusion turned to dread quickly once I realized the noise was coming from the office coat closet. With a lump in my throat, I walk the few paces it takes to reach it. The buzzing becoming clearer with each step. I slowly opened the door and there it was. Sam's phone. Buzzing away in the pocket of her jacket, still hanging in the closet. It should have offered some type of comfort, as I was expecting something much worse, but it only added to the dreadful feeling. 

I closed the door and hung up, thoughts swirling through my head. She wouldn’t just leave her stuff. Did someone take her? Did she ever leave ? That last one sent a chill down my spine. There was no reason for me to think that, but it was the one that stuck as I started looking around the office to see if she left anything else. A small black object under the table caught my attention.

Her shoe?

I picked it up, and sure enough, it was. The left shoe to the pair of black pumps she loves, lying just under a chair pushed into the circular table. After the discovery settled, I noticed a slight scuff mark on the polished wood, a singular line going from the chair to the office door. It's barely noticeable, but in the state I'm in, everything is standing out. I walked out of the office to try and see if anything else could tell me what happened. A little part of me also hoped I wouldn't find something, that my imagination was just running wild.

As I entered the lobby, a woman with curly brown hair kept back by a silk scarf approaches the desk, making me jump back in surprise. She set her handbag on top of the counter and offered a warm smile.

"Hello, I was wondering if we may have another ice pail? My husband is making a big fuss," she chuckled. "Room 113," she said as she pulled out 2 dollars from her purse.

I return the smile and slightly wave off her money, "No need ma'am, here you go." I say as I open the cabinet under the desk, grab an extra pail, and hand it to her. Our fingertips brush against each other, I don't know how to explain the feeling of her touch other than like a feather. Almost like she brushed a ball of cotton against me.  I chose to ignore it, I had too much on my mind already, and there was no need to add more to it. The lady turned and left with the pail, walking down the hallway. When she was out of sight, I started looking under the desk for more clues, I noticed that the switch to the lobby speakers was locked shut. Literally locked shut, a piece of metal with a key lock that keeps the switch suck in the 'On' position. That wasn't there last time, when did Mr. Smith put this on? It had to be recently. 

I stood up and saw the woman's handbag was still sitting there, so I decided to call her room and ask if she'd like me to bring it up or if she wanted to come down and get it. I turned around to the key desk behind me, which had the phone on its counter, and noticed the 2nd set of keys to room 113 were hanging on the board. I chalked it up to the couple losing it earlier in the week. Maybe Sam found them and hung them up again. I pulled out my phone and sent a quick text to the boss man, letting him know that the spare keys the room were hanging on the board and that I might have to leave the lobby to return a purse. Hitting send while I continue to call the woman's room. 

It rang. And rang. And rang.

After a minute, I hung up and began walking to the stairs with the key and her small red leather purse in hand. I refuse to use the elevator after it broke down on me for the 5th time. Mr. James keeps reassuring me that it's been fixed and I have nothing to worry about, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Not to mention, I always felt weird when I would ride it, like the type of scared you get when someone is yelling at you. The reflex to cower in the corner and wait for it to end. 

I finished walking up the 3 flights and exited the stairwell, the old door making a loud creaking sound as it swung open. The age of this hotel shows itself in every nook and cranny; from the tan floral wallpaper peeling at the baseboards to the elevator buttons that get stuck if you don't push them hard enough. Even walking down the halls is a reminder, each step causing the floor to squeak and moan. The smell of permeated smoke, perfume, and recent cleaning supplies, offering an odd sense of comfort. When I reached the door, I could hear muffled sounds of a man and a woman arguing, I stood there for a moment debating on what I should do. I decided to knock. After the third one, I heard a man clear his throat and call out, "How can I help you?" In a sickly calm and charming voice. 

"Ma'am? I called just now but I brought up your purse, you left it on the counter in the lobby."  I replied, "I also brought up your spare key".

The man said something in a venomous voice that I couldn't make out. 

"Thank you miss, my wife can be so forgetful." He chuckled, his voice drastically different from the second before. "If you could leave it outside the door that would be appreciated,  we're not decent at the moment".

"There have also been noise complaints, sir" I harshly stated. There wasn't, I don't think there was even anyone else on this floor. "Calls about a man screaming. I was wondering if you knew anything about it."

The sound of light menacing stomps causes me to flinch, something deep down urging me to run and get back to the lobby. So I did just that. My lungs burned from heaving air as I sprinted down the halls and stairs, the feeling only adding to my deep pitted urgency. When I reached the desk I heard my phone ding and pulled it out of the drawer. It was a reply from Mr. James. 

"Room 113 only has one set of keys and no one is staying in there?" 

What? I just heard them, and I'm quite sure it was room 113. The feeling in my stomach grew, sending a numbing feeling to my fingers and feet. The only thought going through my head was "Where is Sam?" The same thought that's been racing through my head this whole time actually. To add to the stress, it seems like someone turned the lobby music up to the maximum volume. I couldn't handle all of these things at once and before I even realized it I was slamming the fire extinguisher onto the lock of the music switch. It only took a few good swings before the annoying sound sputtered out, finally allowing me to think clearly. We'll as clear as I can. Looking back now, I wish I had just endured the ear torture. 

I had just gotten my breathing back to normal when I saw someone outside the window. Not just anyone. The same man from before, the one in the suit and fedora. His back was turned, but his presence made the air feel thick with a heaviness I couldn’t describe. The man seemed to be... Waiting for something. Someone.

I jumped at the sound of the door opening, the sudden jingle of the bell startling me out of my thoughts. My heart raced. I stood quickly, eyes scanning the lobby, but there was no one there. The door had opened by itself. My skin crawled. I felt it again—the sensation that I wasn’t alone. I felt watched.
I took a few tentative steps forward, peering further into the lobby. The silence was oppressive, thick as fog. My mind was spinning. Maybe it was the stress, maybe exhaustion, but something about this place felt… off. I looked out the window again and the man was gone, replaced by the emptiness of the front parking lot. I sat down on the chair cautiously, waiting for the next creepy encounter. 

About 2 hours after everything settled down, I finally felt calm enough to get back to my duties. I was vacuuming the lobby when I noticed something. There, at the entrance of the office, was the faint outline of someone peering around the door. My breath caught in my throat. I turned quickly, rushing back towards the hallway, nearly stumbling over my own feet. But just before I could make it to the stairway, I heard footsteps, slow and deliberate, coming toward me from behind. My heart pounded in my chest. I looked back to make sure they weren't close.

And then I saw him.

The man in the suit, the one from the security feed, stood at the end of the hall, his mangled face slightly obscured by the shadow of his hat. He took a step forward, the cane tapping rhythmically on the floor as he moved closer. I could feel the unease settle deeper into my bones. The weight of his gaze was palpable, even from this distance. The tension in the room was unbearable.

I made it to the stairs and slammed the door shut, bolting up each flight like my life depended on it. And it did. Pushing past the ache in my legs and chest, I climbed all 3 cases. The slight jingle of the key in my pocket. I forgot to leave it at the door with that woman's purse. The realization giving me the idea to go to that room to hide. It was the only option other than a supply closet. Without a second thought,  I ran to the room, unlocked it, and ran it. I was expecting a surprised or even upset couple to be in the room but what I was met with instead was much worse. 

There on the bed, laid Sam. Covered in gashes and blood. I stood there, like a deer in headlights, wondering if this was real or some type of psychosis. Hearing her cough out my name was enough verification for me and I ran to her. I ripped the pillowcase off the pillows and started applying pressure to the wounds. 

"The music," She whispered. 

I looked at her puzzled. Then, using part of the bedsheets, I wipe the blood off her bruised face. I asked her what happened but before she could answer we heard the distinct sound of an elevator ding, and then the sounds of a limping stomp accompanied by the forcefully taping against the creaking floors. 

Then it hit me. The music. This happens when the music stops, well it gets worse I suppose. I pull out my phone and the microphone icon to hum the song and look it up. I love the internet. It didn't take long for the man to be so close to the room we could hear him muttering. Finally, my phone brought up the song and I tapped on it as fast as I could, putting the volume as loud as it could go. I slid my phone towards the door in hopes that he would hear it and go away, at least long enough for us to leave. Tears slid down my eyes as I continued to help Sam, silently praying that some god would help us.  

The sounds of a man aggressively jiggling the door handle caused both of us to flinch and embrace each other. I let go only to try and arm myself with anything I could find. A broken wine bottle. Perfect. When the door flung open, I closed my eyes and lunged towards the man bottle first. Except...I didn't?

When I opened my eyes I was sitting on the bed, still holding Sam. Not taking a second chance for granted, I grabbed my phone still playing the music, wrapped Sam enough to stop the bleeding, and managed to get her on my back. Realizing quickly I would not be able to go down the stairs carrying her, I walked towards the elevator. Sam was tightly holding the broken wine bottle as a precaution while we road down to the main floor and out of the hospital.

We listened to that song the entire drive to the hospital. When we got there and the nurses asked what happened, I didn't know what to say. I just kept sputtering about finding her like that and the man and music, they ended up also treating me for shock with IVs and some tube thing around my nose.

I am supposed to be getting a call from the police for a statement sometime this week, but I still haven't come up with a sane way to say everything.
