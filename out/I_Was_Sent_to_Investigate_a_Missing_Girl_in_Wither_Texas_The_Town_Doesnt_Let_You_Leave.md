I wasn’t even supposed to take the call.

Private investigators don’t usually handle missing kids. Not officially. That’s law enforcement territory. But a lawyer friend owed me a favor, and the girl’s father, a man named Hal Cromer, was out of options. His thirteen-year-old daughter, Ellie, had vanished four days earlier in a town called Wither, Texas.

Never heard of it?

Neither had I.

It’s not on most maps. A cluster of rusted buildings and dirt roads in the middle of the panhandle, surrounded by scrubland and silence. The kind of place you forget exists until it swallows someone whole.

Ellie had been visiting her grandmother when she went missing. No phone calls. No signs of a struggle. Just vanished after walking home from the town library.

The local sheriff said she probably ran away.

But Hal didn’t believe that. And, after going there myself, neither do I.

I’m writing this from a hotel room in Lubbock. I don’t know how long I’ve got before someone comes knocking. I just want this out there.

What I saw in Wither wasn’t normal.

And I don’t think I came back alone.


It took me six hours to reach the town. The GPS gave up halfway there. My phone lost signal. The last stretch of road into Wither wasn’t paved — just gravel and broken asphalt winding through empty fields.

The air felt wrong. Still, heavy, like it hadn’t moved in years.

I checked into the only motel, if you could call it that. Four rooms. A dusty reception desk. The woman who ran it had a voice like sandpaper and eyes that watched too long. When I signed the guestbook, I noticed something: no new entries for the last seven months.

I asked her about the Cromers.

“Good folks,” she muttered. “Don’t get many left like them.”

“Any news about Ellie?”

She froze. Then, quietly: “That girl ain’t the first to vanish. Just the first they noticed.”


Hal met me at the house. He looked hollowed out — like grief had burned him from the inside. His wife sat on the porch swing, rocking back and forth, whispering prayers under her breath.

“She left the library around 5:30,” Hal told me. “Her gran watched her go. She only had to walk two blocks. Never came home.”

I retraced her steps that evening. The town was dead quiet. No kids. No traffic. The few people I passed wouldn’t meet my eyes.

There was something strange about the place. Not just the silence, but the way the buildings leaned, the way the streetlights buzzed even during daylight. It felt… stagnant. Like time had slowed to a crawl.

The library was locked. Dust covered the windows. A handmade sign said “CLOSED DUE TO MOLD.” But it wasn’t mold I smelled through the cracks.

It was something older. Earthy. Wet.

Like a crawlspace after a storm.


I started asking around the next morning. But people clammed up the second I mentioned Ellie. The owner of the diner told me to “mind my business.” A man at the gas station said “the land don’t like strangers poking around.”

Then I met a boy named Travis behind the town hall.

He couldn’t have been more than sixteen. Cigarette in hand. Eyes darting like a rabbit’s.

“You’re lookin’ for the Cromer girl?” he asked.

I nodded.

“She’s down there,” he whispered, pointing toward the field past the church. “Past the water tower. Where the grass dies.”

“What’s down there?”

He shuddered. “Old part of town. They say it burned down in the sixties. But it didn’t. It just…sank.”

“Sank?”

He dropped the cigarette, stomped it out, and said, “If you go, don’t follow the singing.”

That night, I had the first dream.


I was standing in a wheat field.

The sky above me was the color of bruised fruit. The wind blew in circles, not straight lines. And in the middle of the field, a door stood upright — a rotted wooden doorframe, unattached to anything.

From behind it came a girl’s voice.

Soft. Melodic.

She was singing something old. A lullaby, maybe. But the words didn’t make sense.

When I stepped closer, I saw eyes looking back at me through the door. Not one set — dozens. All level with the ground.

That’s when I realized the field wasn’t a field.

It was a roof.

And something below it was waiting.


I woke up choking on air. The motel room smelled like dirt. Real dirt. Like the scent you get after digging a grave.

I checked my shoes.

The soles were muddy.


I returned to the area behind the church. There was a trail — barely visible — leading through knee-high grass. A half-hour walk brought me to a burned foundation, overgrown and forgotten.

Beneath it: stairs.

Cracked, moss-covered steps descending into the earth. No railing. No signs.

Just stone and shadow.

It didn’t feel abandoned. It felt buried.

I descended.

The air got colder. The walls were carved into the earth. I expected the smell of mildew or rot, but what I got instead was sweetness.

Like old sugar.

At the bottom, I found a corridor.

And at the end of it — a room.

The floor was dirt. The walls were lined with mirrors. Each one was old, warped at the edges. And in every mirror, I saw myself.

But my reflection wasn’t quite right.

Some blinked when I didn’t. Others had mouths moving silently. One had something wrong with its hands — long, twisting fingers that wrapped around its own throat as I stared.

And in the largest mirror, directly across the room, I didn’t see myself at all.

I saw Ellie.

She was standing in the middle of a field. Same as my dream. She opened her mouth.

And sang.

Her voice echoed off the walls. My ears rang.

I turned and ran.


I didn’t tell Hal. Not yet. What would I even say? “Your daughter is inside a mirror under a sunken church singing ghost songs to keep something from waking”?

He’d think I was insane.

I barely believed it myself.

But I knew I’d seen her. And she wasn’t dead.

She was trapped.


That night, I heard scratching at my motel door.

Not knocking.

Scratching.

I looked through the peephole. Nothing.

But beneath the door, I saw it: a shadow moving wrong. Like something crawling on the ceiling, casting itself down onto the floor.

I didn’t sleep.

The next morning, the motel owner was gone.

So was the guestbook.


I drove out of town. GPS kicked in again after five miles. I parked at a rest stop and called Hal.

“I think I found her,” I said. “But I need your help.”

We met at the church. I brought two crowbars, flashlights, and the old revolver I keep in the glovebox for bad jobs in worse places.

When we got to the staircase, Hal hesitated.

“What the hell is this place?”

“I think it’s older than the town,” I said.

We went down.

The mirror room was as I left it — only this time, every mirror was fogged.

Except one.

The largest.

Ellie stood inside it, unmoving.

Hal ran to it.

“Ellie! Baby!”

She didn’t react. Just kept singing that same, wordless melody.

And behind her — something stirred.

A shape in the wheat. Massive. Crawling forward, slow and patient.

“Smash it!” I yelled.

Hal raised the crowbar and brought it down.

The mirror cracked.

The singing stopped.

And everything went black.


When I came to, we were back in the field.

Hal was screaming.

Ellie lay in the grass, eyes wide open, body limp.

But she wasn’t alone.

Beside her were six other girls.

Pale. Filthy. Dressed in clothes decades old.

One of them wore a sundress from the 1950s. Another had a church pin on her collar. All of them had the same expression.

Blank.

Empty.

Like the lights were on, but no one was home.

Ellie blinked.

Then screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget — like something ripping inside her.

The other girls ran.

Ellie didn’t.

She looked up at her father and said one thing:

“It followed me out.”


We burned the field.

The whole damn thing.

Authorities wrote it off as an accidental brush fire. Sheriff never even called me. I doubt he wanted to.

They knew. All of them. The motel woman, the townsfolk, even the preacher I saw watering a dead lawn every morning — they all knew.

The town fed it. For decades. Maybe longer.

Children go missing in other towns. They grieve. They search.

In Wither?

They forget.

They let it happen.

That was three weeks ago.

Ellie’s recovering. Slowly. But she doesn’t talk much. Only at night, in her sleep.

She hums that same lullaby.

Over. And over.

Sometimes I hear it too.

Even when I’m awake.

And last night — I looked in the bathroom mirror and saw her standing behind me.

But when I turned around, no one was there.

Just a wet footprint on the tile.

If you ever find yourself passing through the Texas panhandle and see a road sign for Wither, don’t stop.

Don’t look.

And whatever you do — don’t listen to the singing.
