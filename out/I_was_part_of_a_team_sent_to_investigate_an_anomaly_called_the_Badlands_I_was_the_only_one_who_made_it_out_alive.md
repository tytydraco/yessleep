“Holy shit,” Katrina said excitedly, slowly stepping forward in the dim hallway. The walls and ceiling were painted the color of green baby puke. The floor had large, irregular stains sunken into its once-white carpet. With all the detritus and dust stuck to it, the carpet now looked more of a smoky gray. Water spots larger than a man grew patches of black, orange and white molds. Their twisting tendrils intertwined like the branches of a fungal jungle. The entire hallway smelled like old, rotting wood and wet algae.  
  
But none of this caught Katrina’s cold gaze. It was the part of the wall that caught her attention now. It seemed totally solid. She walked confidently up to it, swirling an index finger through the illusion. She watched in wonder as her wrist disappeared, and then her elbow. She pulled it out, and the wall seemed like wisps of smoke around her skin. I could see the ghostly material reforming, swirling like mist until it had entirely reformed the illusion within a couple seconds.  
  
“How do we know anyone in there is still alive?” our team leader Snake asked, his tanned, Neanderthal face splitting into a scowl. He kept playing with the sharp dagger he always carried around with him, the polished wooden grip flashing as he threw it into the air and caught the spiraling knife in his other hand.  
  
“They’re probably not,” I said, feeling adrenaline coursing through my veins. I had never been sent on a mission into the Badlands before. The Director had sent a few other teams into these anomalies that kept popping up in random spots around town, sections where the wall or floor appeared solid but, in truth, were anything but. This anomaly had been found in the basement of an abandoned office building by an electrician twenty-four hours earlier. I would have loved to see the look of surprise on his face when his hand first disappeared through the seemingly solid wall.  
  
He had called the owner of the building and his son to tell them that something odd was happening in this crappy abandoned place. The owner, a cantankerous, old man with the generosity of a miser and the shrewdness of a Machiavellian prince, decided he wanted to go investigate and find out if the building he had gotten for pennies on the dollar had something valuable hidden away in its depths. He had probably thought he had found extra floors and rooms that could drastically increase its value. But whatever they had thought, the father and son never came back after they disappeared through the mirage of solid wall.   
  
The electrician had ended up waiting a couple hours before he finally called the police, who had arrived and examined the scene, totally baffled. Then they called our agency and locked the place down until our team could get there.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“It’s a go,” Snake said as a command came in through his headset. We all had an earbud and connected mouthpiece that would connect back to central headquarters. In the past, though, the connection had gone out when other teams had gone deep enough into the Badlands. I felt a rising sense of exhilaration and anxiety ring through my body like a struck bell as Snake flicked the safety off on his rifle and disappeared through the soggy basement wall into the unknown. Katrina winked at me, her blazing eyes the same brown color as the soil in our town’s graveyard. She followed quickly behind Snake. I went last.  
  
“Watch your backs in there,” the Director said through the earbuds. “The last anomaly killed three of our team members, and we weren’t able to recover their bodies. I don’t want to see you three suffer the same fate.” I rolled my eyes.  
  
“What an inspirational speech,” Katrina muttered as she passed through the wall.  
  
I could never get used to the feeling of passing through apparently solid structures into the Badlands. I felt all the hairs rising on my body, my skin sizzling as if a bolt of lightning were about to descend on me as fast as death itself. An overwhelming odor of ozone surrounded me. My vision swam through seemingly liquid layers of baby puke green. They flowed in strange overlapping patterns, moving outwards like the ripples on a pond. It felt like I could actually see every quantum cloud as energy passed by in all directions at tremendous speeds. And then I was through.  
  
In front of me, I saw Katrina and Snake running forward in their black military gear through a dark hallway. Fluorescent lights flickered above us, dimly illuminating short patches of the hall, but entire lengths of it were plunged into near total blackness. I flicked on my headlamp, seeing Katrina and Snake doing the same.   
  
I saw an endless hallway of smooth, gray stone looming in front of us. Some fetid, black slime dripped down the outside of them. Tiny writhing larvae covered the floors, like red maggots with pale, white eyes on stalks. I felt their bodies crunching like acorns under my boots as I continued following the team deeper into the stone halls of the Badlands. I glanced back, but the part of the wall we had come through was gone. The hall stretched out in that direction, quickly disappearing into darkness.  
  
“Shit, we’ve got blood,” Snake said, putting his hand up and stopping us suddenly. I looked down. The white glare of the headlamp showed fresh streaks of blood leading off into an intersecting corridor. It opened up into what looked like an office room from the Apocalypse.  
  
“If you find both of them dead, team, just turn around and head back,” the Director’s deep voice boomed through the headset.  
  
“How are we supposed to get back when the door we came in disappeared?” I asked. Snake shook his head.  
  
“There’s more doors where we came in,” he said.  
  
“Wherever there is one anomaly, there are usually several more,” the Director added. “Just remember the way you came in.”  
  
Broken tables with rusted and destroyed computers on them stretched across a space the size of a football field. I looked up, but the light from the headlamp wouldn’t even reach the ceiling. It was strange seeing the smooth, stone architecture of the Badlands combined with smashed monitors and water-logged office desks.   
  
In many of the chairs, mummified corpses sat, their grinning skulls staring up blankly into the shadows above them. They all had on the same sort of clothing. As I moved closer, I saw they wore black shirts and sweatpants, brand new black-and-white Nike Decades and armbands reading, “Servants of Moloch.” Some strange sigil had been emblazoned on the front of each of their shirts in bright red cloth: a pointed bull’s head with smoke coming from its grinning, fanged mouth.  
  
“Well, this is something new,” Katrina said, prodding one of the mummified corpses with the tip of her rifle. The entire head fell off, sending up a cloud of brown dust that smelled vaguely of cinnamon. Snake frowned down at the corpses.   
  
“What’s a ‘Moloch’?” Snake asked, staring icily at the skeletal remains in front of him. “Is that some sort of cult or something?” Katrina just shook her head. He glanced at me, as I knew tons of random knowledge.  
  
“It’s an ancient god, though the name also refers to the ritual sacrifices,” I said, trying to remember back to what I had heard about North African history. “Thousands of years ago, people in Carthage, or Tunisia as they call it nowadays, used to worship a bull god called Moloch. They even made huge metal statues of Moloch that they could light fires inside. Moloch would have its metal hands reaching out to the crowd as flames erupted from its eyes and smoke from its nostrils and mouth. Then the crowd would begin offering infants and small lambs to the bull god, placing the screaming children on the scalding metal hands. The priests and others would have drums pounding and people chanting during the sacrifices to help drown out the dying, agonized cries of the infants.” Katrina gave a short bark of cynical laughter, but Snake looked slightly sickened.  
  
“That’s fucked up, brother,” Snake said. “Where do you even hear about this kind of crap?” I shrugged.  
  
“Well, it was in the Dexter books,” I explained simply, but Snake didn’t seem to get the reference.   
  
“If they’re that stupid to sacrifice their own children,” Katrina said, a crooked smile still playing across her lips, “then it sounds like they’re doing humanity a favor. Natural selection, you know. The children probably would have been as dumb and blind as the parents.”  
  
“That’s sick,” Snake said condescendingly. She only shrugged blithely.  
  
I glanced at the trail of fresh blood that swept through the massive chamber and out the other side. A deep roaring sound erupted from the far end where rows of splintered and burned desks were gathered.  
  
“We’ll keep following the blood trail,” Snake said, his flat eyes gleaming darkly as he surveyed the room. “Once we confirm that both the owner and his son are dead, we can just head back and report this.”  
  
“As if it’s ever that simple,” I grumbled, but Snake didn’t even look up. His finger was tightly curled around the M4 carbine’s trigger. He kept his gaze focused on the distant end of the chamber.  
  
“Simon, watch our backs,” Snake said to me, motioning to Katrina to advance towards the source of the sound. We followed the trail of blood forward past the half-burnt and splintered rubble littering the stone floor. Up ahead, I saw a body laying on the floor with its legs facing us. It looked like someone in an expensive gray suit, and they weren’t moving. Snake slowly advanced on it with Katrina a few paces behind him.   
  
I kept checking our backs, but the headlamp sent shadows skittering across the massive chamber. In the dancing and swirling of the darkness, I thought I glimpsed something twisted and pale dragging itself forward. I kept checking those areas but, if something was stalking us, it kept itself well-hidden. I could never confirm whether my eyes were just playing tricks on me, or whether the creatures of the Badlands already knew we were here.   
  
“Oh, shit,” Katrina swore softly ahead of me. I looked down at the body, seeing that the corpse’s head was totally gone. In its place, a ragged patch of bloody, torn flesh stretched, slowly dribbling clotted blood. The trail of blood ended at the body.  
  
“But where’s the son?” I asked, looking around. “Why is there only one blood trail and one body here?”  
  
“Maybe Moloch took him,” Katrina said jokingly. As if in confirmation, another shrieking roar ripped its way through the massive chamber. It traveled slowly like the aftershocks of an earthquake. The granite floors beneath our feet trembled and Katrina nearly lost her footing. I stumbled forward, giving her a steadying hand, but I felt like a sailor on a storm-swept ship for a few moments.  
  
Snake continued to advance towards the source of the roaring, as sturdy and single-minded as ever. We left the decapitated body of the father behind. The shadows grew thicker and deeper. The chamber started to narrow. I felt the stone floors begin to slope downwards. We were heading into the bowels of the Badlands.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
We descended for what felt like a very long time, jogging forward with our full gear and kevlar vests on. Soon, we had to slow down. Our headlamps seemed to grow weaker and penetrate the darkness less and less as we descended, as if the shadows were a living thing consuming the light in its faceless mouth.  
  
After about twenty minutes of this, the scenery started to change all around us. Statues hewn into the granite walls towered over us on both sides. Some showed twisting, eyeless creatures that crabwalked on all fours. Whatever sculptor had done this had captured their essence perfectly. I could almost see the statue taking off in my mind, skittering across the floor. But, even more disturbingly, these statues reminded me of the barely glimpsed horrors I thought I had seen back near the mummified corpses.   
  
The floors and walls had started to change as well into a glassy, obsidian-like material. The air grew warmer and more stifling, as if we were descending into an active volcano.  
  
“Holy shit, what is that?” Snake asked, sounding extremely disturbed about something. I had been staring at the statues on both sides of us, periodically checking our backs. I felt eyes on us, but I hadn’t seen any signs of something stalking us. I looked up to where Snake was pointing with the barrel of his gun.   
  
Stretched across the narrow tunnel stood a blackened metal statue of a bull. It loomed at least thirty feet in the air. In its belly, I saw a raging inferno, the flames writhing and dancing in cyclonical currents. The bull’s eyes glowed a bright red like freshly-spilled blood. Its gaping maw grinned, showing off countless needle-sharp silver teeth. It had its giant blackened hands extended toward us, like a child showing off a toy.  
  
But in its smoking metal palms was no toy. Instead, I saw the burnt, smoldering body of many infants.  
  
A roaring emanated from the statue’s mouth, deafening as a gunshot. I covered my ears, turning away from the horrid sight. Even Snake and Katrina looked taken aback.  
  
Then the statue moved, its head lowering, its eyes blazing, its mouth slowly opening with the whirring of many gears. From somewhere deeper in the obsidian tunnel, I heard drums pounding and people chanting in some strange and ancient language.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
“What’s going on there, team?” the Director asked as we backpedaled quickly. The statue’s thick, clawed legs extended so that its head nearly scraped the ceiling. Its grin seemed to widen as it stared directly at me. My heart froze in my chest. I raised my gun, but it felt feeble and small compared to this beast of metal and fire.  
  
“No, no, help me!” a small voice cried out from behind the best. I saw men in black robes dragging out a small boy from behind Moloch, still chanting. Behind them, cultists dressed in the same garb as the mummified corpses rang bells and bashed drums. The cacophony nearly drowned out the screaming of the child.  
  
The priests and cultists froze when they saw us. The singing and drums immediately cut out, leaving only the panicked screams of the boy. The priests stood around the bull-god, their faces pale and expressionless. Many of the cultists had signs of lobotomies on their foreheads, deep, straight scars dug into both sides of their frontal lobes. They stared like sheep with open mouths, their eyes glassy and rolling.  
  
“Give us the child,” Snake hissed, his voice menacing and full of venom. The priest holding the boy only laughed.  
  
“And what will you do if I do not?” he asked in a strange accent. “This is the will of Moloch. No one defies the great god, the giver and taker of life.” I looked up at Moloch, but the blackened statue looked like just another hunk of metal again. Its eerie, mechanical movements had stopped.  
  
“I’ll start by murdering all your cultist friends,” Snake said, his eyes flashing. He raised his rifle, tightening his finger on the trigger. “I’ll give you three seconds to…” At that moment, something smashed into Snake from behind, cutting him off. I spun, seeing dozens of naked pale, twisting bodies crawling on the ground, their lidless eyes gleaming like cataracts. They all had the same insane rictus smile frozen on their rotting faces. They were only the size of a small child, but they moved fast. I cursed myself for not watching our backs.  
  
Snake fought with the thing as he fell. I moved forward to help him, but at that moment, many things happened at the same time.  
  
The boy bit the priest’s hand. The priest holding him gave a surprised cry of pain and released the boy, who sprinted toward us.  
  
Moloch also chose that inopportune moment to spring to life. Still glaring down at me with eyes the color of a slit throat, his rhinoceros-like feet pounded the ground, his thousands of pounds of metal and fire shaking the floor with every step. I froze for a moment, the gun held limply in my hand. Then all of my training and adrenaline kicked in. I raised the rifle, aiming at the ancient god’s eyes and then pressed the trigger.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Moloch gave a shriek of surprise and pain as dozens of bullets smashed against its metal face. They pinged, eating giant holes into the blackened steel. The fire within its face blazed higher as the bullets allowed more air to rush in, feeding the flames into a rising frenzy.  
  
I sidestepped Moloch at the last moment. It ran forward in a straight line, barely missing me by inches. I felt a whoosh of air as it ran past, its metal joints shrieking, the floor pounding with every step as if it had been struck by lightning. The bull god’s horns nearly pierced the obsidian ceiling as it raised its head to its full height.  
  
The boy ran at Katrina. She was smiling and laughing as she opened fire on the priests and cultists, mowing them down one by one. They began to scatter like cockroaches, running in the opposite direction, screaming for mercy.  
  
I saw Snake fighting for his life with the twisted, stunted creature in the middle of the tunnel. It writhed like a snake in his grasp, biting and clawing. He tried to get a hold on its neck, but it wriggled out of his grip at every turn. Deep gouges ran along his arms and face, dripping fresh drops of fat blood that spattered the black floor like rain. Even worse, they were right in Moloch’s path.  
  
“Watch out, Snake!” I yelled, but it was too late. He looked up as Moloch’s heavy foot came down, crushing him. There was a wet sound, the crunching of bones. Blood, hair and organs exploded beneath Moloch’s foot like a water balloon. When Moloch raised it, only a bloody pancake of gore and flattened skin remained.   
  
“Fuck! Fuck!” I screamed. “We need help!”  
  
“What’s going on?” the Director asked, his voice anxious.  
  
“Snake’s dead!” I cried. “We need to retreat! Katrina!” But she was already one step ahead of me. She grabbed the boy, picking him up and running over to me. His face was full of tears and snot, his little eyes red from crying. I saw specks of blood spatter in his black hair from the battle.  
  
“We need to get back to the door!” I cried, looking back down the tunnel. Dozens of the pale, twisted creatures skittered like maggots around Moloch’s pounding feet. He slowed like a train decelerating at a station. After a few long steps, he turned to face us again. His face was half-destroyed, and one of the eyes was a flaming crater of ragged metal now. But he still had his wide grin spread over his face, his iron teeth gleaming.  
  
I opened fire on the creatures writhing on the ground. They ran forward towards us in a pack, their sharp teeth gnashing the air, their claws tapping against the glassy floor. As they got nearer, I smelled rot and sulfur emanating from their pale flesh.  
  
One by one, Katrina and I shot them, but Moloch had begun to charge at us again. I grabbed the boy, hurling him to the side. Katrina sidestepped, but Moloch changed direction. With his horns down, he plowed right into her, skewering her body right through the navel. She was raised high into the air as his head came up. She screamed in agony, her arms and legs flailing as blood exploded from her mouth.  
  
“Katrina!” I cried, knowing it was too late. She didn’t appear to hear me. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she went silent.  
  
I grabbed the boy and pushed him forward toward the pale creatures. I reloaded, keeping a constant rate of fire. We headed back towards the mummified corpses and computer room. The boy had become a blubbering mass of gibberish.  
  
“I thought I was dead, thank you so much, oh my God, they were going to burn me alive,” he spewed in a stream of consciousness.  
  
“Shut up, kid,” I hissed. “We aren’t out of here yet.” As if to confirm that, as the broken and splintered desks appeared in front of us, Moloch gave chase.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I turned, seeing that Katrina still hung on his right horn, now totally still and lifeless. Moloch’s one remaining eye flashed on the boy.  
  
“My sacrifice,” he gurgled in a voice like thunder. It shook the floor. “Give me the boy, and I will let you live. I am, after all, a forgiving god.” I looked at the boy for a long moment, considering it.  
  
“Nah,” I said, raising the rifle and aiming at its face. “I’d rather take out your other eye, I think.” Moloch roared as I opened fire. His heavy legs came down, smashing the computers and cracked monitors into dust. The boy screamed and wet himself, a stream of urine running down his leg.  
  
But Moloch was too fast. As I fired at his head, his clawed hand came down, swiping me along the back. I felt a burning pain as deep gouges ate their way into my skin. I went flying, hitting the wall hard. I lay there for a couple seconds, stunned. In my dazed state, I watched as Moloch’s other hand grabbed the screaming, crying boy and threw him into his fiery mouth.  
  
“No! Dammit!” I cried, feeling warm blood trickling down my back. I started crawling away, hearing Moloch’s heavy steps pursuing me. I raised the rifle and aimed at its remaining eye with the last of my strength. As I emptied the magazine, I uttered a silent prayer to a God I didn’t believe in.  
  
Moloch’s remaining eye shattered with a tearing of metal and the pinging of bullets. His voice thundered in surprise and pain as I rolled out of his path.  
  
“Blind! I can’t see!” it hissed as I crawled away, breathing hard. It felt like a few of my ribs were cracked. Every inhalation felt like fire.  
  
I made my way back into the hallway we had come from, searching for the door out. Moloch continued shaking the floor as he stumbled blindly through the caverns of the Badlands.  
  
Near where we had come in, I saw a shimmering, translucent hue covering the granite wall. Hoping against hope, I put my hand through it.  
  
With immense relief, I stumbled through the mirage and back into our world, the sole survivor of the Badlands.
