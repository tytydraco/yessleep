So for context, I work as a summer intern at a production house in London. My job is as unglamorous as it sounds — collating raw footage, digitising tapes, filing transcripts into long-term storage. Ninety-nine percent of it is dull: wildlife B-roll, unused interview segments, stuff that never makes it to air.

But last week I came across something different.

It was a transcript for a documentary called **The Gullskerry Experiment**. According to the header, it was never aired. I can’t find any record of it online, and when I asked my supervisor about it, she told me to stop ‘being nosey’ and focus on the archive logs.

I probably shouldn’t be doing this, but the thing’s been keeping me up at night. If anyone here knows anything about Gullskerry, or if this rings any bells, please let me know. For context, here’s the transcript I found—exactly as it appeared in the file:

**Transcript from the unaired documentary** ***The Gullskerry Experiment,*** **seized before its release following a joint inquiry by the University of Edinburgh and UK authorities.**

**Anna:** Could you please state your name and occupation for the camera?

**Imogen:** My name is Imogen Clarke. I am—*was*—an MSc student in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh. I was part of the Koestler Unit postgraduate research circle—you know. Before.

**Anna:** What was your role, if I may ask?

**Imogen:** Technically, I was the archivist. I monitored the equipment, ran the software, kept the synchrony graphs running. That sort of thing. Of course, being such a small group, we wore many hats. Tea maker. Mother hen.

**Anna:** Tell me about Gullskerry.

**Imogen:** The Gullskerry trip was our field methods retreat. It was Eve who first suggested the place.

**Anna:** Eve Kavanagh?

**Imogen:** That’s right.

**Anna:** And why the Gullskerry Ornithology and Field Station, exactly? Why so remote?

**Imogen:** That was Eve’s idea. She’d heard about it from another researcher who’d supposedly used it the year before on a different project. Actually, it was ideal. We knew we needed a place away from any outside influence—contamination, and all that. Gullskerry was about as far from civilization as we could get on our budget.

**Anna:** What was the purpose of your experiment? What were you hoping to achieve?

**Imogen:** *You don’t know?*

**Anna:** I’d like to hear it from you, please, if you don’t mind—for the audience.

**Imogen** (pauses to take a long drag from her cigarette): *Are you familiar with the Philip experiment?*

**Anna:** You’re referring to the incident in 1972. A team of psychologists in Toronto made up a ghost.

**Imogen:** Almost. They used the power of suggestion to essentially “think” the entity—Philip—into existence. It would rap on the table, move things on command. Things like that.

**Anna:** I remember the experiment being met with much criticism. I think the phrase “parlor trick” was even used.

**Imogen:** Of course. People have a hard time believing in anything they can’t see with their own eyes.

**Anna:** So you and the rest of your group, you were hoping to, what, reenact their experiment? Pick up where they left off?

**Imogen:** Yes—and no. We didn’t just want to retread old ground. That would be pointless. What we wanted was a *full materialisation*; what’s commonly referred to in Tibetan tradition as a ‘tulpa’, or thought-form.

**Anna:** What made you think you could succeed where the Toronto group had failed? 

**Imogen** (pauses again to finish her cigarette before blunting it out in a nearby ash tray): In Mexico there’s a species of fungi known as *Psilocybe mexicana*. It’s been used for centuries by the Mazatec people in ritual-healing, divination, communion with what they called the divine. Westerners hear that and think *hippie nonsense*, and while there may be some truth to that, recent investigations have shown the same compound, psilocybin, does something very real. It changes how the brain talks to itself. Normally the cortex is modular, tidy, predictable. Under psilocybin, the boundaries dissolve—regions that never speak begin *cross-talking*. The brain becomes globally integrated.

(Imogen pauses as she leans forward in her chair)

That was our hypothesis: if you want to manifest a thought-form, you can’t do it in a normal state of mind. The defences are too strong. You have to lower the filters first. That’s where LAM-73 came in.

**Anna:** Right—about that; how exactly did you come into possession of the compound?

 **Imogen:** So, turns out psilocybin was too crude for our efforts. Too messy, too unpredictable. We needed something cleaner, more refined. Finn said he knew a guy who knew a guy; from his side-gig recording promos for a biotech startup at the Edinburgh BioQuarter. Or at least, that’s what he *told* us. Anyway, that’s how we got it.

**Anna:** And this compound—it was legal?

**Imogen** (stares):

**Anna:** So, just to be clear; you took an illegal, experimental psychoactive compound. And you didn’t even check to see where it came from?

**Imogen:** Not quite so reckless as that. We looked into it, made sure it was legit. We’re not idiots. We were a bunch of post-grads out looking to make a name for ourselves. We wanted to change the world. To be the pioneers of a brand new phase of human understanding. Sometimes great change requires great risk.

**Anna:** And how did it work, exactly? Your experiment?

**Imogen:** We drew inspiration from the Philip experiment, mostly. Compound aside, there wasn’t anything particularly novel about our approach. The Toronto team had already laid the foundation, and we saw no reason we should try and reinvent the wheel. We took the work they’d done and modernised it.

**Anna:** Modernised how, exactly?

**Imogen:** Many ways. We used EEGs and fNIRS to measure the brain’s electrical activity; this was what allowed us to tell if our brainwaves were in sync, as well as which areas of the brain were currently active. And the compound, of course. But we also kept a lot of stuff too. We blacked out the room, lit candles—setting the mood, and all that. We wrote Ben a backstory—

**Anna:** *Ben?*

**Imogen:** Our tulpa. Our ‘Philip’. We chose a name we thought would be easiest to hold in mind as the compound kicked in. We figured a single-syllable name was best.

**Anna:** I see.

**Imogen:** It was a struggle, at first. Half the group wanted to make him as generic as possible. Others—Finn and Lew, mostly—wanted to make him distinguished and unique. There were arguments. It almost derailed the whole experiment at one point.

**Anna:** So? Who won?

**Imogen:** We managed to reach a compromise. Half the group would be responsible for writing his backstory, while the other half crafted his physical characteristics—facial features, height, eye color and so on. What we arrived at was a twenty-seven-year-old white male from the UK, six foot-two, stocky, attractive but not aggressively so. Someone who wouldn’t stand out in a crowd, but you wouldn’t immediately kick out of bed—or at least, that’s how Mara put it.

(brief pause as Imogen lights another cigarette)

Fleshing out his backstory was a bit more complicated. There was a compulsion to go overboard; trader, corporate executive, et cetera—probably would have still done so, if not for the fact we didn’t have the months to practice visualising that the Toronto group had. In the end we decided to make him more relatable. A couple unremarkable jobs, a failed relationship. I don’t know why, but it felt right.

(Imogen hesitates a moment before continuing)

We tried conjuring Ben without the compound first. This was on the second day. This was our control; something to measure all following experiments against. We initially wanted to hold on for a day or two—we were still tired from the ferry over, but seeing as we only had funding enough for a week, we knew we couldn’t afford to waste any time.

**Anna:** And? How did it go?

**Imogen:** Honestly? Not great. We’d only had time to practice as a group on maybe one or two occasions before setting off for Gullskerry. Mara and Rafi kept giggling. The fact that we were so tired didn’t help—*have you ever tried holding a person’s face in your mind for hours at a time?* It’s exhausting. We’d lose focus, then someone would bring out a guitar. Again, we were just kids.

**Anna:** When exactly did you start incorporating the compound into these experiments?

**Imogen:** After the fourth night. Low doses at first—around five-ten milligrams, taken orally. Lew was the one who administered—that’s Lewis McKay, our harm-reduction lead. He monitored vitals, kept notes. Sweet guy. I think I miss Lew the most.

**Anna:** So you took the compound and just… ‘imagined’ this Ben into existence?

**Imogen** (laughing): No—simply imagining would have been impossible. The mind tends to naturally stray, so to counteract this we came up with a chant. We set a metronome for sixty beats-per-minute, and on every fourth beat we’d say a line: ‘Ben, we see you. Ben, we know you. Ben, we made you. Stand with us’. Just over and over, for hours at a time. Think of it like an anchor.

**Anna:** And it worked?

**Imogen:** Not at first. We saw changes in the EEG. Minor brainwave changes—nothing groundbreaking, but enough to see that the compound was clearly working. We knew it wasn’t enough. So…

**Anna:** You raised the dose.

**Imogen** (nodding): Twenty-five milligrams. Longer sessions. We knew we were pushing it, but by that point we didn’t care. And then, on the seventh day, we saw something.

**Anna:** What?

**Imogen** (hesitates): There should have been four readouts on the EEG—one for each of the active participants. We began to notice a fifth. Real faint, at first. We thought it was an artefact—a glitch, maybe. Only it kept coming back. It made no sense, of course; Eve, Finn, Mara and Rafi all wore headsets; electrodes set to capture their brain activity. This new waveform came with *no source*. Later, when I printed the CSV file, there was a column with no header. Data without a device. I still have nightmares about that column.

**Anna:** It was Ben.

**Imogen** (nodding): It was just a glimpse. But it changed everything. Suddenly, we had something substantial. We had *proof*. We could have ended the experiment there. But we wanted more. We’d seen past the veil. We wanted to know how far we could take it.

(long pause; she exhales smoke slowly from her nose)

We conjured Ben on the last day. We knew we wouldn’t get another chance, and decided to give it one final shot. We upped the dosage to thirty milligrams—beyond any clinical trial. It was stupid, of course. But we had an obligation; to science, and to the world. That’s not hubris. We genuinely believed we would change lives.

**Anna:** And is that when…?

**Imogen** (nodding): You could feel the energy in the room change. The sudden differential. Eve and the others kept chanting, growing louder and louder, until by the end they were practically screaming Ben’s name. I’ve never been to church, but I imagine that’s what it must feel like; that sense of communion, of being in the presence of something greater than yourself. The cacophony built and built, and I remember right before the candles blew out looking over at Lew, seeing the frightened look on his face. He could feel it too. The magnitude of what we were doing. And then…

**Anna:** Then?

**Imogen:** The candles blew out, and Lew immediately jumped up to throw on the lights. And then suddenly there he was. Ben. *Our Ben*. Sitting in the deck chair we’d set aside for him, just like we’d planned. We all took a lunging step back. Everybody was screaming; fear and excitement and disbelief, all mixed together. He looked exactly how we’d pictured him, right down to the tiniest detail; his eyes, the little half-moon scar on his lip from where he’d fallen off his bike as a kid—all except for one thing.

**Anna:** Which was?

**Imogen:** His smile. There was something wrong with it. *Deranged*, almost, like his lips were smiling, but his eyes… I don’t know how to explain it. It was just wrong.

**Anna:** What happened then? Afterward, I mean?

**Imogen:** We tried our best to document it. Lew and I did most of the heavy lifting, the others still coming down from the compound. We tried talking to him—

**Anna:** *It talked?*

**Imogen** (shaking her head): ‘He’—and *no*. Don’t get me wrong, we tried—*what is your name? Do you know where you are?* We even poked him with the boom, just to see if he was really there. He never moved a muscle.

**Anna:** That’s unbelievable.

**Imogen** (scoffing): Right? We were beside ourselves. We couldn’t believe it. We laughed and cheered. Ben just sat and watched. It was amazing—until we realized we had a problem.

**Anna:** What do you mean?

**Imogen:** We didn’t know what to do with him. In all of our planning, we’d always just assumed that the moment we stopped manifesting him, he’d disappear. We never took into account the possibility of him sticking around.

**Anna:** And then the storm hit.

**Imogen** (nodding): Right. In hindsight, it probably did us a favor; we knew the ferry wouldn’t risk picking us up in that kind of weather, so at the very least we figured it would afford us an extra night or two. And we still needed to figure out the whole Ben situation, so…

**Anna:** And that’s when things went bad.

**Imogen** (hesitates): We’d started sleeping in shifts. The storm had knocked the power out, but luckily we’d still had the candles from before. We huddled in the Blind Room—

**Anna:** The what?

**Imogen:** The Blind Room? It’s where we held the sessions. Technically, it was the common room. It wasn’t ideal, but it’s where Ben was, and we knew we couldn’t leave him unattended. One of the failsafe measures we’d included in our dossier about Ben was that he would freeze if observed—he had to; that’s how we’d imagined him. Of course, what with him sticking around, and that awful smile, we had no idea just how much of what we’d imagined about him had taken root. But we figured better safe than sorry. We’d expected to be there an extra day or two while the storm passed, three at most. But then two nights turned into three, then three into four. Tensions began to rise. We were exhausted, and honestly by that point we just wanted to go home. Being stuck inside didn’t help. There were… fights.

**Anna:** *Fights?*

**Imogen:** Between Rafi and Eve, mostly. Almost always over nothing. They’d scream at each other, accuse each other of things; stealing stuff, hiding each other’s belongings. You know—*dumb stuff*. Ben would watch from his deck chair, his head completely still but his eyes always moving. Sometimes his mouth would move in-sync with whoever was talking—real creepy shit. I think that’s when we first started to really get scared, like we were out of our depth. And then, the next night…

(Imogen pauses as she’s briefly overcome with emotion)

**Anna:** And that’s when it happened?

**Imogen** (sobs):

**Anna:** What happened to your friends, Miss Clarke?

**Imogen:** I was sleeping at the time. It should have been impossible. Somebody must have dozed off on watch—it’s the only thing I can think of. I heard furniture crashing, people screaming… other sounds. Suddenly Mara came bursting into my room, panicked and wild-eyed. There were flecks of blood on her clothes. She said Ben had gone nuts, that we had to hide. We ran for the boot room. I could still hear people screaming down the corridor behind us, things breaking. Then suddenly it all just… stopped. Mara told me to hide under the coats while she went to go check. I never saw her again.

**Anna:** What did you do? After she left?

**Imogen:** I stayed. The coastguard found me on the third day. The ferry had come to pick us up, and when we’d failed to show, they’d radioed it in. I was catatonic when they arrived. They wanted to know what happened.

**Anna:** The coroner’s report mentioned injuries consistent with those of high-speed collisions. They said no person could have inflicted that kind of damage—something your defense seized upon repeatedly in court.

**Imogen:** I don’t know anything about that.

**Anna:** Why would Ben kill everyone like that?

**Imogen:** Honestly? I have no idea. I’ve read theories online, people saying he was really a ghost. Some ‘malevolent spirit’ who used our compromised mental states to mess with us.

**Anna:** But you don’t think so?

**Imogen** (hesitates): Every piece of Ben was comprised of parts of our own individual psyches. I think when we started fighting, when we started turning on each other, it affected him. He absorbed it all like a sponge—all that anger, that *rage*. And when whoever was supposed to be watching him fell asleep, it was like a bomb going off.

**Anna:** You’re aware that the footage from your experiments was recently made available to the public. No evidence of a man fitting Ben’s description can be seen in any of the tapes. How do you respond to that?

**Imogen:** I don’t care. I know what happened.

**Anna:** Do you know why Ben chose to spare you?

**Imogen:** Like I said, he’s an amalgamation of all of us. He would have known that we were what was keeping him tethered to reality. If all of us were to die, he’d have had no anchor, no way to remain.

**Anna:** Do you know where Ben is now?

**Imogen** (looks briefly to the empty corner of the room): No.

**Anna:** Are you okay? You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.

**Imogen:** I don’t want to talk anymore.

**Anna:** Okay, we can stop here.
