Conversation Hearts: Part 3

[Previous Update: Longing with Teeth](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fd5cxf/i_miss_you_i_cant_stand_the_hunger_when_we_arent/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Sorry for the delayed update, I think I'm going to have to split this post into two parts as, evidently, I have exceeded the character limit. It has been a long week. We had a bit of a scare with the baby. Everything’s fine now. I had some light spotting the other night. I’m not all that shaken anymore, but it freaked Johnny out real good. The doctor says everything looks healthy. He even let us listen to the heartbeat for reassurance, though I think that was just to make Johnny stop crying. A little blood is supposed to be normal at this point in a pregnancy, the cervix is becoming tender or something. I don't know, I stopped listening after he said the baby was healthy, everything after that was placation. All the doctor’s mambo-jumbo didn't seem all that important to me, but Johnny ate it up. Honestly, I might start sending him to appointments without me, cause I certainly didn't need to be there for most of that with the way he and the doctor got on. On the bright side, they put me on pelvic rest, so I guess that's one less wifely duty to worry about. 

I fucking hate my life. 

Not actually. I’m super excited to be a mom, or literally anything other than “just Johnny’s wife”. This town is going to kill me. Sorry for the rant, I’m kind of struggling to adjust to the idea of parenthood, or maybe it's just the idea of parenting with him. Please ignore me. My life is wonderful and I couldn't ask for a more attentive husband, I’m just tired. Been tired for years and it hasn’t killed me yet so I doubt it will kill me now. Don’t worry.

Mags I miss you, so if you're reading this please stay away. I am hormonal as all hell and I don't think I have the bandwidth to chase you off if you come back.

Our town was the type where most folks didn't know nearly enough about birth control to keep their families from growing like weeds well beyond the borders of their houses. It was the perfect breeding ground for religious fanaticism when most kids were married by twenty and raising-up a new generation of followers before the ink could dry on their childhoods. It didn't help that no one ever seemed to leave. Year after year me and Mags waited for our turn, for our houses to fill with laughter and little feet but they never did. We were stuck, alone with each other, locked into our age-appropriate activities without any older siblings to teach us the lore of the town. So we started making our own kind of folklore. 

Mags would make up stories, at first silly little things like a baby raccoon who got adopted by the king and dressed in fineries. Sometimes her tales were closer to the truth. A queen who would spend hours in the library talking with the handsome scholar, whispering to him from time to time when she thought her husband wasn't looking. Dead princesses who waited by wells for their living little sisters to come play with them. A mother who had been so taken with the world she didn't notice when all her children left her one by one until she was alone in her huge house. That one had always seemed oddly sad to me, but knowing what I do now I just feel sorry for Mags. I knew her home life wasn't the best but to be forced to keep secrets so young, it's no wonder she never learned how to tell the truth. 

Back then Mags had all the words and I just did my best to capture her wild imagination on the paper. I had nicer spelling and handwriting than most of the others in our grade, but as the year went on it became increasingly obvious that my perceived prodigy was failing. I had no innate talent for academics, only the little step-up my mother had given me by starting my education earlier than most. I knew the game wouldn't be half as fun if I wasn’t useful to her so I put everything I had into learning how to draw. I like to think I got halfway-decent at it. The kids at the school used to think so anyway, but then again when you're a kid it's easy to find wonder in the world of adults. It made them happy at the least.

Mags and I kept to ourselves in those early months, not necessarily by choice, but we were used to isolation and things were not nearly as lonely when there were two of us. The tight confines of our friend group didn't bug us much. We were not welcome in the typical liminal spaces of childhood so we found our places to settle away from the spiteful eyes of the town. There was a small river valley in the forest that brushed up against the border of suburbia. The drop wasn’t large, maybe ten feet of high-piled boulders at the edge of the river's tempting expanse, and on a good day, a small child could almost think they could clear the jump to the other bank. We never tried, but I can't say we were never tempted to, the only thing that dissuaded us was the turbulent flow of the river and a story born so early in our friendship that neither of us could quite remember if it was really ours or some old relic of the town. 

According to the story the river had a hunger, or maybe the river was an embodiment of hunger. It's been years so you'll have to forgive my imperfect memory. Whatever the case, the important thing to know was that the river was responsible for swallowing up the weeping dead girls of the town. According to the story, there were two little girls— who may have been sisters but probably weren’t— who lived on the stubborn edge of the forest where the trees grew so thick the town had never managed to cut them back. It was the last bit of unbroken wilderness in the quickly spreading melancholy of industrialization and those two little wisps made their home at its mocking edge inviting in whatever primordial evils slumbered at the forest's heart.

The water was higher then. So high that the jagged rocks at the river’s bed, that gnashed at the water like hungry teeth, were nearly completely covered. Not lying in wait, but still thunderstruck with that terrible hunger. The river was a gentle bounty that raised the girls when their parents couldn’t be bothered to. It gave them delicate, salty fish and sweet crawdads to eat, clear clean water to drink, and a lovely melody of singing streams to listen to once they had had their fill. 

In many ways, the river was their mother, which might be why they were called sisters. Their lives were simple and sweetly mild back then. They could spend their days in meadows with berry-smeared faces, hair in wild tangles, and come home as the least burdenful children of their families with their full bellies and pretty faces. They were content. They wanted for nothing and in return, the river took nothing from them. Which is why the first dead girl was such a shock. It had been a temperate, sunny day, so perfect it was almost boring. The girls as always were at the river’s bank soaking up the rays of summer and chasing dragonflies along the water. 

It happened when the cracked egg of the sun sizzled high in the sky, the girls were so lost in themselves that they forgot who they were entirely. In their games of chase, it wasn’t clear what they were chasing, or perhaps what was chasing them. They were in stride with all of the insects and all of the birds unsure who should follow who. So, they just ran in the sun, overjoyed to have bodies that could run on such little legs when one of the girls, the taller one, was overcome by a sharp, hot pain in her foot. And then another, and then another. Her senses were overwhelmed by saccharine and gold, and above all else that terrible, droning pain. The younger girl could only watch as thousands of angry bees overwhelmed her friend forcing her into a blind stumble until her heel went over the edge of a rocky bank and she was swallowed whole by the river. She watched her friend's surprised face from under the glassy surface as the girl didn't even try to fight, instead smiling, twisting in pain, screaming, laughing, clawing at her throat, and floating with her arms out like an angel. Filling her lungs with fresh clear water until her body stilled and the river went calm. 

By the time the smaller girl had returned with adults her friend's body was picked clean of all but its bones which shone amongst the brightly colored river stones like gems. It was decided that there was no point in trying to retrieve a girl so scattered by nature. So there she remained one with the river that had raised her.

The smaller girl visited her friend as often as she could because— despite what the adults told her— she knew the other girl wasn’t gone. She had just changed shape, the same as the smaller girl would one day have to if she wanted to stay in the forest. The smaller girl grew up strange and pretty and the river grew with her pulling down the facade of soft waves to bear sharp, blood-hungry fangs rolling over a sandy tongue. The townsfolk might have whispered about how the girl would talk to the river when no one was looking, even dance with it, laugh with it, strip off her clothes, and frolic in her undergarments like a little girl on wobbly new limbs and throw her head back in a show of sharp teeth. They would say all of that if any of them had the guts to even get close to the forest after what happened. So the smaller girl spent her childhood alone, becoming plump with the gifts of the river. She grew into a painfully beautiful woman, wild like no other as the river now only had one daughter to focus its energy on. It was no wonder then that suitors began lining up to ask for the girl's hand in marriage. There wasn’t a single man in the town who could resist the opportunity to test his strength against the unbraved wilderness that had for so many years resisted refinement. 

It was a quiet day when the smaller girl's father told her she was to be married. She did not throw a fit, nor claw at his eyes, nor overturn the house in her primal misery, though he almost wished she would. Instead, she sat with her cold stare— uninviting as the river itself— peeling away his skin, sighed, and finally nodded in acceptance after long minutes of silence. Her only condition was this, they would marry before the eyes of the river who she regarded as her true mother, father, and all else in between. Without any real excuse to not, her father was forced to agree. Soon the date was set and the smaller girl found herself once again at the same stretch of river where her friend had died years before. Much was the same as that day, only this time she was not barefoot and tangle-haired chasing after childhood dreams, but clean-cut and bound in a tight, white dress chasing after her ghosts.

All the guests watched with teary eyes as the girl delivered her heartfelt vows speaking about bliss, beyond bliss, and the deliverance of a welcoming Lord who would allow her and her beloved to soak in His light whether it be in this life or the next. There was no death that would part her from the other half of her heart, nor any balm that could soothe the pain of being separated. She spoke of wild berries, babbling brooks, and starry skies over untouched earth, pure and chaste as she was. And when her husband leaned in for the kiss she simply slipped her heel back and allowed herself to fall into the violent rapids below. Her body struck the water with a dull thud, as her head dented against the rocks like a soft melon. Soon her form was lost in the churning water, torn to scarlet ribbons of lacey flesh and bits of silk finery. She whirled about the massive teeth of the creature and gladly slid into the depths of its maw as little more than a formless pulp stuck between the great flats of granite molars. So many pieces of her intertwined with the chipped bone of her sister, as the bigger girl became the rock, the smaller girl became the water. Only then could she once again feel the true presence of her beloved as their souls intermingled in the bloody waters of the river. 

According to the story, the girls are still there. On sunny days that are so perfect it almost seems boring, only on those days, you can find them on the bank, dancing and babbling and telling little folk tales to each other under the watchful eye of the river.

Thinking about it we must have heard the story from one of the older kids. Mags and I were a bit melancholy for two-second graders, but we weren’t downright morbid enough to come up with anything nearly that dark. At least I hope we weren’t. Actually, with the way Mags’ dad preached about the fires of damnation, we definitely knew enough to imagine a story about two dead girls who lived in the river. I wonder if Mags and I constantly hanging out on that river bank didn’t help to revive that story if it already existed. Maybe we were the original girls by the river and some local youth saw us and thought we were ghosts. It would be some trick of fate if a story about Mags’ and I being stupid by the river ended up being told to us as a tragic ghost tale after being passed from mouth to untrusting mouth. Life's funny enough for it to be possible.

For reasons that were beyond the both of us the dead girls’ river was our favorite place. It was about a ten-minute walk from Mags’ house since her father insisted on living next to the town’s original church, which was a breadth away from the wild woods that engulfed the town. The trail was barely more than a game path, too small and rough for any adult to travel comfortably, but perfect for two lanky little girls. Mag’s mom used to come with us to watch, and make sure we didn't get into any trouble. The trail down to the river was short enough that she had a pretty clear view of us sitting in the adjoining meadow. She always looked more at peace when we were away from the house, I would even dare to say she was happy to spend those lazy afternoons with us. This was long before she made out the shape of exactly what Mags and I were to each other before that horrible hate set in. We were young, innocent, nothing more than little grabbing hands and bright smiles.

She thought of me as the second daughter that she was promised, a stand-in for her little Olivia gone before her first breath. Mags talked about her sister a lot. It was the only thing that could strain our relationship. It hurt me that she knew so much about her siblings when my parents were driven to silence by their grief. Hell to this day I don't even know all of my siblings' names. Mags dined at a high table of memories and love while I was deprived of all but the rotten scraps of my family's history. It made me jealous enough to almost hate her at times, but then I would see that crooked-toothed smile of hers and she would hug me tight and tell me we were sisters and all the vitriol just melted away. She was my real family. If I had to sit through a hundred stories of dead girls it would be worth it just to be close to her.

Our first Halloween together was perfect. Our mothers had fallen into a fast friendship that almost made me wonder if the way Mags and I felt about each other was hereditary. We spent all of October over at Mags’ house playing under the kitchen table while our mothers worked in tandem to make our costumes. You see it was 2005 and phones weren’t really a thing yet— especially not for kids our age— which meant outside of weekends and preplanned playdates Mags and I didn't have any reliable way of contacting one another. Sure we only lived three streets apart but one of those streets was the main road through the so-called “downtown” area, which made it far too perilous of a trek for two kids. 

The taffy notes were our only form of communication and beyond that they had a certain intimacy that using the landline, sending letters, or even openly talking lacked. It was a unique kind of magic made especially for the two of us. I know a lot of you probably think we were stupid for not questioning any of it, but keep in mind we were young and didn't realize how weird things had been. You can’t blame us, we were (almost) seven and eight respectively, and still very much believed in all sorts of strange magic from Santa to the tooth fairy (which I hold is a much more terrifying concept than cross-dimensional notes). Yes, some weird things were happening with me and Mags, but also our parents actively encouraged us to sell bits of our bones to a winged creature for a dollar, magical note passing was tame compared to that. Besides after the horror of our separation I never really got the sense that we could stop, even if we had wanted to. So we made a plan to ensure we could never run out of candy.

Mags and I thought our plan was genius. We would have our moms make us two costumes each– one for “school” and one for trick or treating— and change between the costumes so that the people at the doors wouldn't recognize us and we could get more candy. We also took it upon ourselves to use some of my mom’s old curtains to make an extra set of sheet ghost costumes in case we didn’t get enough candy during the first two goes. By our, admittedly poor estimate, we would need around 1,000 candies each if we wanted to have note supplies until the next Halloween. Never mind that in our prime we could burn through twenty candy notes a day. We were never great at logistics and most of our scheming sessions were cut short in favor of watching Scooby-doo reruns. Mind you this was in the heyday of “What’s New Scooby-Doo” also known as the greatest media program of all time, so we could only be expected to resist the temptation for so long. We called our cartoon binges “research” to make ourselves feel better.

This isn’t important to the story, but if I hadn’t promised my mother otherwise this baby would be named Fred. I love Scooby-doo and I will hear no complaints about any tangents related to the gang especially as this story gets darker. I need some joy in my life. Sorry I'm off-topic, I plead pregnancy brain. 

To no one's surprise, Mags and I had decided on Daphne and Velma for one set of costumes, which became a bit of a tradition in its own right. On Halloween day we met up on my street and we could walk to school by ourselves for the first time. Halloween is a big production for our neighborhood so all the housewives of the town were out in force putting up their final decorations and readying the houses for tricker-treaters. Needless to say, our moms felt safe letting us walk to school by ourselves under the watchful eyes of the mom brigade. On top of that, we had gotten special permission from our teacher to bring Maggie’s dog into school. He was a lumbering labrador named Hans who was the definition of a gentle giant but looked scary enough to dissuade any would-be kidnappers on the short walk. We thought bringing a dog to school was the coolest thing ever so we dressed him as Scooby to match us, mostly as an excuse to bring him into class. 

Mags’ mom must have been under the impression that my birthday actually fell on Halloween from how my mom described our traditions, because when Mags turned up at the bus stop she had Han’s leash in one hand and a balloon with the words “Happy Birthday” written in big pink letters in the other. She was dressed as Velma with a hand-knit, cozy orange sweater, a reddish tulle skirt that brushed just below her knees, and an oversized magnifying glass that she wielded like a magical wand. She honestly looked more like a princess than Velma because of the ballet skirt, but according to her a regular skirt would be “too boring” for Halloween and I can't say I disagree. 

When I saw Mags and her mom turn the corner onto my street my heart nearly jumped out of my chest from excitement. Our eyes met and I braced myself as she tackled me into a pile of dry leaves, grabbing me in a vice grip hug and screaming the words to the birthday song so breathtakingly out of tune it was comical. We sat up and giggled together as we watched as her mother tried and failed to wrangle Hans back onto his leash. Eventually, she walked back, looking rather dejected, and handed the leash to Mags, who promptly chased the dog down and leashed him while he was busy covering her in slobbery kisses. Mags then ran back to me with Hans in tow. When she got to me she pinned me down and licked the side of my face with a horrible slurping sound. I was frozen in shock for a second before I elbowed her in the diaphragm and the two of us disappeared into the abyss of red and orange detritus. We spent the next few minutes wrestling in the leaves, kicking wildly and tearing at each other's costumes as I did my best to get her back. Seeing that we had the situation under control, Mag's mom left only slightly worried about the disgusting little monster she had raised. Our game ended when Hans decided to join in the fun and began drooling all over us, much to our joint terror. Mags helped me out of the leaf pile and tied the balloon string to my wrist as we started our meandering journey to school. 

We were maybe three houses down when Mags laced her fingers through mine and tilted her cheek against my crown with a sigh. Her breath tickled a bit when she spoke, which made me blush, which made her smile. We argued about whether dragons or unicorns were cooler to pass the time. Mags thought the unicorns were better because they were prettier and could do magic, but dragons could fly and that obviously trumped pretty in my books. She said unicorns could fly too, I didn’t believe her, so I told her that dragon scales were made out of gold and ruby which meant they were prettier than unicorns. She was taken aback by my lie stopping us in our tracks to just stare at me slack-jawed.

In a deadpan voice, she simply stated, “Dragons are not made out of gold,” and something about her conviction bugged me so I dug my heels in and prepared to escalate the argument. 

“Yes, they are.”

I could see I had her cornered as she started to yell, in a hysterical voice very close to a laugh.

“They’re not!”

“They are and you know what else, they can also breathe underwater! Wanna bet on it? Go ask that guy over there. He’ll tell you!”

Before I could stop myself I was pointing at the nearest person: some pot-bellied, middle-aged man already preoccupied with putting up fake cobwebs on his hedges as his yappy little dog scurried about underfoot. And because Mags was never reserved a day in her life she shoved the leash into my hands and marched right over to the man with her hands on her hips. She and the man chatted for a bit before she started to head towards the house and to my horror Mags followed her. She disappeared behind the swiftly shutting door before I could even yell for her to come back. To this day I have nothing that has inspired the same degree of all-encompassing terror as watching that door close with my best friend on the wrong side of it. 

Hans was tugging at the leash trying to follow. He wouldn’t stop barking, it was all I could hear above the autumn wind and the creaking of the house as it seemingly came to life.

The house was old and on the brink of decrepitude, with fleshy tan paint that flakes off like dead skin. Even being as young as I was I knew the vines and spots of mold were nothing compared to whatever rot waited within and yet I felt myself drawn towards it like a moth to a lamp. This strange liminal space had swallowed my friend behind its barred door. It was a siren’s song of horror and I was as weak as a sailor driven mad by my curiosity. I had lived on this street since birth and yet I couldn't recall this house, with my world kept as small as it was. I assumed I knew every inch. Yet, there was a violent contradiction, something new and unknown in the unchanging confines of my prison. I needed to know what was waiting inside, what had taken my only friend into its depths. Despite every fiber of my being telling me to run, towards it or away from it I do not know, I was stuck in place. 

It was as though every drop of blood had drained from my body, collapsing my veins, collapsing my body itself inwards. I tried my best to commit every detail of the man’s appearance to memory. His sickly greenish pallor, beady black eyes, and the tawny straw of his thinning hair. His limbs seemed just a touch too long, thin, bowed hanging limp next to the horrible bloat of his stomach. Had he been touching her when they walked in, and why didn't she resist? What promise was so tempting to lure her away from me? He must have threatened her through cracked rotting teeth, spilled poison into her mind, or tricked her into following him. I wasn't sure if I should run for help or try and break down the door myself. I was small but I knew from my experiences with my father that I could ward off a grown man with the right motivation. Maybe I could have even killed him to keep her safe. I just couldn't lose her. 

I wanted to move, but I had no breath. It was a painful clawing in my chest and I swear I could feel my defeated lungs collapsing from the weight of my terror. I was on the brink of tears when Mags reemerged with a broad smile on her face holding a huge plastic bowl of candy. The man stood behind her, but his features had changed, his face was weathered by decades of sun, but he looked friendly with prominent smile lines pinching at the corners of his mouth. The greenish hue of his skin had been the glow of his garden reflecting on his rosy cheeks and his limbs were not nearly as wrong as I had recalled in my panic. 

I ran to her, meeting her halfway up the cracked stone driveway, not caring if the candy bowl spilled as we bashed our knees on the rough concrete. I must have been crying because I remember Mags’ tiny hands dancing softly against my face to wipe away my tears. One hand on my shoulder to steady me and the other holding my cheek as she leaned and planted a soft kiss on my forehead.

“He said dragons can be made of gold if we want them to be. You were right!” she spoke barely above a whisper, and when that didn't help she changed her tack.  

“I’m okay, you're okay. All the bad things go away.” It was a silly chant her mother used to say whenever one of us was having a meltdown, but it helped in its own way. I was still stunned by the feeling of her lips. That was the first time I can remember wishing Mags was a boy. I began to suspect that something was wrong with me even if I didn’t know why.

My world was so painfully small that everything was unknown. I was surrounded by terror at every corner, constantly uncertain if the woman in that window was real, if the man checking his mail was a molester, or if the neighbor's dog was just waiting to break free and eat me. I longed for the innate sense of trust all the other children seemed to have, for that ability to take people for their words to suddenly blossom in my chest so I could be as happy as everyone else but it never did. I had almost ruined a good man's life because he was unknown to me, which in my world of isolation was the greatest crime. 

She was patting my head, no not her, her hands hadn't moved. These hands felt different, longer fingers and less certainty in the movements. That's when I saw him, a little boy about my age, but maybe younger. He had been eclipsed by the light of Maggie’s return, but now stepping out of her shadow I knew his face instantly, that thing that was waiting in my house the reason I could never turn away. If Mags was my sun then this boy was my moon, not nearly as bright but always there just waiting for the day her light would finally shine bright enough to blind me. He had tawny curls and big watery brown eyes that looked like cups of weak tea in the early autumn light. He was so skinny it made my heart ache and I was seized by the urge to wrap him up in a warm blanket and tuck him in my coat pocket for safekeeping. He was like a wounded bird, with thin bones and high prominent cheeks, broken wings, and a face painted with a wind-whipped blush. I can’t remember the last time I felt that way about his face.

I hated him at first, when we were picking up the candy and his fingers brushed Maggie's. He flicked his hand back as if burnt with a fiery red burning the tips of his ears and Mags gave him a perfect smile, the same smile she always made when she was looking at me. I hated him when he ran back to his dad to get us bandaids for our scraped knees and when Mags took his hand in her left palm and mine in her right and put them together to make us shake.

“Hi there I’m Jonathan, but my Pop-pop calls me Johnny. Too many Johns in the family, or that's what he says. I don't really know what that means. What's your name? You are very pretty! Are you a princess like Margret? I like your costume!” His palm was pleasantly soft and strangely cold. I thought his smile was stupid back then, and I still do now. 

“I’m Josie and Mags is not a princess, she is Velma! I’m Daphne, our costumes go together. What are you supposed to be?” 

“Josie, don't be mean! He’s coming with us, okay?” Mags was always too kind for her own good, but I couldn't refuse her so I mumbled a mostly incoherent apology and we started walking to school, the three of us hand in hand. 

I knew full well that he was dressed as a cowboy by his hat and boots complete with little spurs and a lasso. It was a good costume and maybe if I had a normal childhood I would have even found it charming. I was just being mean, I wanted him to leave. He didn’t.

Hans was still barking. 

On the way to school, we found out that Johnny was in the grade below us. He had just moved into town at the start of October, after his mother lost her job and decided he was better off with his grandad. He was a bit sickly and missed a lot of school, Mags offered to help him with the homework he had missed. We were his first real friends and that made something deep inside me soften a bit. I could see him sitting alone at lunch, sad that no one wanted to play with him and I saw myself sitting with my mother at the kitchen table wondering why I was never allowed to play with the other kids. In that way, we understood each other. I wasn’t thrilled to share Mags with anyone, but I couldn't leave him out to dry when I knew how much that isolation hurt. So, I decided that if Mags had embraced him, I would try to as well. 

After the shock of Mags disappearing had worn off we realized how profitable our little ploy could be. By the time we reached school, we had swindled six families out of a significant chunk of their candy supply. We decided to give a good bit of it to Johnny to buy his silence and stashed our earnings in the ugly library return box, no one used it anymore after the other one was repainted in new shiny colors. 

We left him grinning at the door of his classroom, but lingered a second in the corridor together, finally alone in the pleasant silence of each other's company.

“He seems nice.” 

I had to begrudgingly agree, because I knew, even back then, that Johnny was all the happy-go-lucky goodness in the world rolled up in a buck-o-five body. 

“He does, but he's not coming trick or treating with us right? I don't want to tell him about the plan. We don’t have to tell him about the notes, do we? Those are just ours? Just you and me? Right?”

Her voice was soft and had a breath of honey in her inflection, soothing and warm. 

“Of course not! He wasn’t invited, now was he? It's not his magic, and anyway, it's a girl's thing. No boys allowed, not even new friends. ” To anyone else, she might have looked like she was about to drift off, but I knew that dreamy glaze to her eyes better than I knew my own heart and nothing felt better than basking in her contentment.

Thanks to the winning combination of Hans and the balloon tied around my wrist, we were the most popular girls in class, if only for the day. Holidays at school were the best there was no actual class work and you got to spend the entire day making thematic paper crafts. That year we made bats by tracing our hands on black construction paper and gluing candy corn under the places where our thumbs overlapped to serve as the fangs. We didn’t wait for Johnny when class finished, he understood though, we had told him when we dropped him off that our moms were coming to pick us up to get us ready for the night's events. That was a lie though, no one was coming for us. 

We grabbed our stash of candy from the return box and made a detour into the woods to stash the candy at the dead girls’ river, taking the long way around so that Mags’ mom wouldn't spot us through the house windows. At this point, the combination of tromping through the woods, rolling in the leaves, and spilling an abhorrent amount of glitter on ourselves during craft time, had rendered our costumes a mess. We were so scared that Mags’ mom was going to let us have it for ruining a month's worth of hard work in one day, but she just smiled and gave us a playful eye roll before having us strip off the costumes to wash and sent us off to bathe, before buttoning us into our little Sea Jelly dresses, which were just frilly blue and white princess dresses with ribbon tentacles. Once we were dressed and cleaned by her mom but sat us in front of the TV with a bowl of popcorn while she went to work making candied apples and other seasonal treats for the party. My mom arrived a bit after four to help Mags’ mom in the kitchen. The two of them always looked happy, with plump-lipped smiles pressing softly at their perfectly rouged cheeks, but their eyes bugged me. They were as hollow as wood balls, dead and dull like looking into an empty window.

I often wonder what it must be like to be built from memories of the person you once were. For your existence to be defined by the rubble of the life you had dreamed of. I suppose I understand them a bit more now, I still don’t think what the two of them did to us was right but maybe their suffering was the kind that had to be shared. God knows my mom’s failed dreams are the only inheritance she has to leave me. 

My mother was an amazing artist, but a better housewife.

My mother had been an art teacher. Her hands would weave and create, with a delicate touch, wavering in the wind like a child's laughter. She was the type of woman who could fill a room with a simple smile, her art seeped into her very core: it defined her. She built herself from clay, molding her rough hands and paint-stained hair from the contents of the dusty supply closet behind the old oak pantry. When I was young she would find me in her art closet sitting on bags of flour filling my soft pink backpack with stolen trinkets. She would scoop me up in her arms, dusting flour on my cheeks before sitting me on the counter next to her with pens and paper and we would create lost worlds. 

I always wanted to stand on the bar stools, and she would let me, but only for a moment before I began to teeter. The image of my sister's head cracking open and cooking like an egg on the hot pavement was always at the forefront of my mother’s mind—Lottie I think, but it could have been Rose. 

For a second I would stand, I would laugh when I realized my nose would barely press against the table’s edge, a high wall that I could not see over. Then my mother would nudge me up to the table once more, not even glancing away from her bubbling pots on the stove, and I would spend hours staring at her hunched over her pots mumbling old lullabies. And I would sit, loving the feeling of my pens gliding across the paper and the counter, on and on until I felt the entire world was covered in ink. Eventually, my dad would walk through the little glass door into the kitchen. He always had sadness in his eyes, when he looked at us, he knew we were two fleeting beings being pulled in different directions, but he could not bring himself to be the one to part us. So he would spend what seemed like hours standing in the doorway watching my mother sing to the bubbling chorus of pots, as his daughter babbled away about covering the world in color. Eventually in the afternoon, when my mother's mind would wear thin and she would call me the wrong name, he would scoop me up in his big arms and carry me away from her all the way back to the other side of the small glass door, leaving my mother alone with her memories. 

She looked more whole when she was with Mags’ mom in the kitchen, the both of them did. They were a balm to each other's aching, able to fill in the bits of themselves that they had lost to motherhood with the others' presence. Together they almost made a full person with a full life, instead of two half-souled creatures. Almost. But our mothers had buried their ambition with their lost children and no matter how human they looked they were little more than walking ghosts, just waiting for the day their bodies would catch up to their wasting souls.

My father says I look more like my mother every day. I think I made a terrible mistake staying. I want to be a good mother to my son, I don't want him to see me as the ghost of a woman who he never knew. I need to get out, but I can’t, I’m too fucking weak. I hate myself, but hey in ten years Johnny will be able to say I was the perfect wife at my funeral. Maybe they can even put that on my tombstone, not like there will be anything else to say.

I had a bit of trouble with the flowey mesh sleeves on my dress and ended up tearing it a bit at the cuff, Mags’ mom let me choose the color for the apples to make me feel better. Mags’ mom didn’t believe in nail polish, though it was a harlot's calling card, but if she had worn nail polish I think she would have chosen a bright candy red, same as she would paint her lips and the same as I would choose for the apples. It was expected, reserved, something so classic I couldn't have deviated from the tradition of it even if I had wanted to. I knew Mags’ mother liked me a bit more for my choice, I had been given a chance at defiance and I had rejected it without another thought. I needed her to love me, to want me around, to keep me close to Mags’ in her heart so it would hurt her to separate us when the time came. I bit my tongue and sunk my teeth into her already bruised soul.

The coloring dropped like blood into the pot of bubbling sugar, coloring the whole thing as red as a raw wound and all I could think was how pretty blue or green would have looked in the sea of glassy candy. I didn't stay to see the mundane shock of the result. I just walked back to the static-ey TV and laid my head in Maggie’s lap. When she stroked my hair I noticed her sleeve was torn a bit too. She just put her pointer finger to her lips and winked and that made me feel a bit better. One more secret, something only the two of us could understand.

I have to split this one up; the second half will be linked below, I'll try and get it up tomorrow. I am so tired.
