My beautiful wife and I married at the age of 24. We were sweethearts from the start, ever since I saw her walk into my class back in college. She looked at me, with her black-framed glasses, lush brown hair down to the middle of her back, and her eyes, the type of eyes that a person is bound to succumb to. Things were great for years. She had a job she truly loved and I as well. One morning she woke up throwing up and feeling uneasy, however rather than being concerned with each other, we rejoiced at the fact we may be bringing a child into this world. I rushed to the store and grabbed three different types of pregnancy test and sure enough we were correct. Aston was born 9 months later and she was was absolute blessing...



...curse, as much as I hate to say it. My wife started acting differently. No longer was she the shy, loving woman I met earlier in life. She wasn't exactly cold but it surely was progessing there. She wasn't happy. Nothing made her smile, not even our daughter Aston. 



I remember this conversation like it was yesterday, but I try not to because how could I not have noticed?



Me: "Did you sleep at all last night?"



Her: (stirring her coffee, not looking up) "A little. Maybe an hour. Doesn't matter."



Me: "It does matter. You need rest. You’re... you’re not yourself lately."



Her: (finally looking up, eyes dull but intense) "And what does 'myself' even mean anymore? Because if 'myself' means exhaustion, emptiness, and wanting to claw out of my own skin, then yeah—I guess I’m still me. By the way, yes I mean truly clawing out of my skin, something has to and WILL change."

 

Me: "I just—I'm worried about you."



Her: (laughs, but there's no warmth in it) "Worried. Of course. That’s what you say when you don’t understand. When you’re scared."



Me: "Scared? What are you talking about?"



Her: (pausing, then smiling slightly, but it doesn't reach her eyes) "Never mind."



(Silence. The coffee cup clinks against the saucer. The air between us feels heavier.)



Me: "You mentioned trying something new for the postpartum... some alternative medicine. What exactly are you looking into?"



Her: (tracing a finger along the rim of the cup, voice low) "Something different. Something that doesn’t just drown me in prescriptions and tell me to wait it out."



Me: "Like?"



Her: "Something older. Something that works." (with the slightest smile ever so shy but ever so grim"



Me: (frowning) "I support you but what do you truly mean?"



Her: (smirks, then leans forward, voice almost a whisper) "Would you believe me if I said it doesn’t matter if you believe me?"



The week after this my life was flipped. 



The day my wife ended my life

The week after this my life was flipped. 



I started noticing the changes in small ways at first—whispered phrases under her breath, strange symbols drawn in the margins of her notebooks, candles burnt down to stubs in our bedroom while she claimed she never lit them. But then, the shifts became undeniable. She stopped talking about therapy, stopped mentioning the postpartum depression at all, as if it had simply disappeared. Instead, she spoke of something else—something older, something that could "fill the spaces" where the pain lived. I found books hidden beneath our bed, pages worn from too much handling, filled with incantations in languages I didn’t recognize. And then there were the nights—those unbearable, suffocating nights where I’d wake to find her sitting upright in bed, motionless, her lips moving in silent prayer to something unseen. She was inviting something in. She wanted to be taken, to be emptied, to be erased. And the worst part? It was working. The woman I loved was slipping away, and in her place, something else was watching me from behind her eyes.



I woke to the feeling of warm breath against my ear, the soft hush of my name slipping through the dark like a thread unraveling. Her fingers were on my chest, featherlight, moving in slow, deliberate circles.



"Breathe," she whispered, her voice barely more than a sigh. "Deeper now… let it in."



My body felt heavy, as if the weight of the room itself was pressing down on me, sinking me into the mattress. I tried to shift, to turn toward her, but I couldn’t. My limbs were stone, my breath shallow.



"Deeper," she coaxed again, her lips grazing my skin. "Let it take you. Let it pull you under."



Something was wrong. My chest tightened, hollowed. The steady rise and fall of my breath became irregular, then faint, then—nothing at all. A cavity of darkness spread inside me, vast and empty, swallowing the air, swallowing me.



I wanted to scream, to move, to claw my way back to the surface, but all I could see in the abyss behind my eyes was Aston—our daughter—her tiny hands reaching out for me. And then her… the woman I had fallen in love with. The woman who used to laugh so easily, who once held me as if I were her whole world. But she was different now. She was looking at me with something unreadable in her gaze, something vast and ancient and hungry.



"You don’t need to fight it," she murmured, cradling my face. "It’s so much easier this way."



And for a moment—just a moment—I believed her.



...then it happened. I was encompassed into an abyss I never thought possible. A darkness deeper than possible. A limitless void where I sway back and forth between the fabric of reality...or what I though reality was. Reality for me was the unwavering image of my daughters hands reaching out to me for one last time.

 



I don’t know how long I drifted in the abyss. Time didn’t exist there. Only shadows, stretching endlessly. Only the echo of my daughter’s tiny hands reaching for me—never quite close enough. Only the smirk on my wife’s lips, the fragile shell of her, trapped in a prison she had invited in.



Then, suddenly, I breathed.



Air seared into my lungs like fire, my chest rising with a violent gasp as if my body had been starved for it. My vision swam, the weight of existence crashing down on me all at once. The room was the same. The bed, the sheets, the soft hum of the world outside. But something was wrong.



The air was stale. Thick with dust and something… else. Something sour. Decay.



I turned my head, and my breath hitched in my throat.



She was there beside me. Or rather, what was left of her.



The body that once belonged to my wife lay in the bed, her delicate frame sunken into the mattress, her skin tight against her bones, dry and cracked like old parchment. Dark hollows replaced the eyes I once adored, her lips frozen in that same unreadable smirk.



I scrambled backward, my pulse pounding, my mind clawing for an explanation that didn’t exist. She had been here. With me. Whispering to me. Pulling me under. And yet, she had been dead for years.



My hands trembled as I pushed myself from the bed, my body unsteady, unfamiliar. Everything felt… wrong. The walls, the air, the way my limbs ached like I had not moved in a lifetime. I stumbled through the house, my breath shallow.



The house was not as I remembered.



Dust coated every surface. The pictures on the wall—our wedding, Aston’s baby photos—were faded, edges curled with time. The fridge was empty, long since powered down, its door hanging slightly open. The air carried the silence of a home abandoned.



Then I saw it.



A small frame sitting on the coffee table, the only thing untouched by dust. My hands shook as I picked it up.



Aston.



But not the child I remembered.



She was older now. Taller. A young woman, standing in front of a house I didn’t recognize, smiling brightly at the camera. Happy. Whole. Without me.

My legs buckled, the weight of it all slamming into me.



Ten years.



I had been gone for ten years.



Not dead, not buried, not mourned. Just… forgotten. Lost in the folds of time while the world moved forward without me. While my daughter grew up. While my wife rotted beside me.



I turned, slowly, feeling the weight of unseen eyes pressing against me.



And then I heard it.



A whisper.



A breath against my ear.



"You came back too soon."



I turned sharply, but there was nothing there. Only the lingering scent of rot and candle wax. Only the vast, empty house that had once been a home.



And the cold, unshakable certainty that the abyss had not let me go.



This whisper will forever be with me until my utter demise.
