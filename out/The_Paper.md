I live in a small town in the southern part of the United States. It’s pretty lonesome and quiet. I’m retired and frankly don't have much to do these days. You see, my son and wife died in a car accident many years ago, and I never recovered. I just confined myself to my big, empty house in the countryside. This is probably why I noticed these strange circumstances so quickly.

Something about the shadows in my home was just off. I’d often feel as if I had seen movement in them, only to turn and look and nothing was there. Now this could all be chalked up to loneliness and aging. The mind tends to wander when you're by yourself, and even more so as you grow older. I soon learned this was not the case.

The following week, several of my neighbors began to tell me of their strange encounters. Each of these experiences shared the same characteristics. They too had talked about a shadow moving in the corner of their vision. But it escalated from there. I was shown cuts on hands, necks, and legs of several people.

They claimed, after seeing this shadow, they heard a rustling sound and then were quickly cut with a thin object. But nothing was there. No one could make any sense of it, and it began to become the talk of our small town. 

Until one night. I lay in my lonely bed, almost drifting off to sleep, when I heard a rustling noise. Startled, I wondered, was it that same noise my neighbors had heard? The noise was followed by a gentle, slow creaking. My bedroom door.

I watched as my door cracked open with hesitation. What I saw made me jump in fright. It looked humanoid, but not quite right. It was as if it was unfinished. Its nose was in the wrong place, and its pale yellow eyes were not fully formed. In addition, its limbs were all of varying lengths. It hobbled around awkwardly. It had patchy grey skin, some parts I could see right through, into the hallway. There was nothing there.

By now, my door was wide open. The creature just stared at me. I lay petrified in fear. Carefully, I reached for the shotgun I kept next to my bed. I live in the country after all. Slowly, trying not to alert the creature. I had no clue what it had planned to do. I fumbled around with the gun and clumsily knocked it to the floor, all the while not taking my eyes off the creature. 

It screeched and retreated into the shadows. I didn't know what to do now, but I certainly wasn't going in that hallway. I lay waiting, anxiously anticipating what would happen next. Eventually, I saw a wiry set of lopsided fingers wrapping around the door frame. I grabbed my gun, trying not to make a sound. When the creature showed its misshapen face again, I fired a shot. I missed, instead tearing apart my door frame.

I had no choice but to wait again. It looked like it was going to be a standoff for the rest of the night. I just prayed that, one: bullets could kill it, and two: I wouldn't run out of ammo.

After about 3 minutes of staring into the shadows, something was different. It appeared that the creature was being formed by the shadows itself. I watched as it came to life. Before it could finish, however, I blasted it with my gun. It came hurdling towards me, only to be completely incapacitated by the shot. My heart raced. Who knows what would have happened had I not hit it. I heard that rustling noise yet again.

A single piece of paper fell to the floor where the creature once was. It felt like I watched it fall in slow motion. I carefully crept away from my bedside and picked it up. 

On the paper was a child's drawing. It looked exactly like the creature that had just frightened me, down to every unnatural detail. On the bottom right corner was my deceased son's signature. The drawing felt vaguely familiar now, but I still couldn't quite pinpoint when my son had drawn it. It was so many years ago after all. 

A strange feeling washed over me. I was afraid of that horrid creature that tormented me in the night. But, I had a bittersweet mood. As strange as it may be, it was almost comforting to have even a remnant of my family, even if a distorted version.

I now realized drawings and art hold more power than one may think. So be careful, you may see something you or a loved one has drawn creeping around in your room or on a lonely road at night. I’ve begun to wonder if this could be the explanation for children's imaginary friends and the monsters in their closets and under their beds. Maybe belief is what keeps them alive. 

Every night, I jump at every shadow on the wall. I dread the night one of my son's drawings comes to life again. But, I’ve had an idea. A truly dreadful one. Maybe, just maybe, I can bring my family back. God help me.
