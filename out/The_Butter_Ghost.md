It was the Friday before Spring Break and my friends and I were at lunch, discussing our plans. Most of us were going out of state to be at the beach with our relatives. My family and I would be spending a week with my aunt and uncle, helping them on their farm. While I would have preferred swimming and making sand castles, I did like animals so I didn't mind too much. Little did we know, all our plans were about to undergo a drastic change by what our group leader, Juna said.  


&#x200B;

“Hey, I have an idea. None of us leave until Monday so how about a sleepover?”  
  
  
We were on board with the idea. All that needed to be done was deciding whose house we’d be staying at.   
  
  
“Why can’t it be your place?” Zeke asked Juna. “You came up with this idea.  
  
“My Dad’s having his poker night tomorrow.”  
  
  
More bickering went around.  
  
  
“Tory, what about you?” Zeke asked.  
  
“My relatives are going to be spending the weekend before we carpool.”  
  
“Melvin?”  
  
“Sorry, our house is being fumigated.”  
  
  
  
Zeke’s elbow had been touching his and he quickly pulled it away.  
  
  
“Lucia?”  
  
“My parents don’t want any messes being made right before we leave.”  
  
“Damn it, and it can’t be at my place because it’s being painted.”  
  
While listening, I was playing Tekken 6 on my PSP.  
  
  
“We haven’t asked Saul,” Juna said.  
  
  
Upon hearing my name,  I paused my game and looked up.  
  
  
“I mean, I’d have to ask my parents first.”  
  
  
“Okay, if everything’s good, hit us up on Messenger,” Juna told me.  
  
  
I agreed and when I got home, I asked my parents if my friends could stay over.  Although it took some convincing on my part, they agreed on the condition the house remained spotless. They were going out of town to help my grandparents do some shopping.  I made sure to let my friends know and everything was good to go.  
  
  
Zeke was the first to arrive and we greeted each other with a fist bump.   
  
  
“I brought over Halo 3,” he said, holding up his copy.  
  
“Alright, cool, my 360’s already set up.”  
  
  
Juna arrived shortly after followed by Lucia and then Tory. Melvin was the last to show up.  
  
  
“Wait,” I stopped him on my porch, “you made sure to take care of that problem right?”  
  
“Yes,” he replied with annoyance, “I spent last night with my hair covered in mayo. Now, can I come in?”  
  
  
The others were waiting for us in the living room.  We played Halo for a few hours before switching to Team Fortress 2 and then Lego Star Wars. Afterward, it was a Cartoon Network and Toonami marathon. The last episode of Dragon Ball Z ended which concluded our media for the night.  
  
  
“We should probably get to bed,” I said and yawned.   
  
“Hang on, I have an idea,” Juna replied.  
  
  
Her lips curled into a mischievous smile.  Instantly, worry crept into me. I’d known her for a while and whenever she got that expression, it never meant anything good. The second worst incident resulting from this was a fire and us nearly getting shot. Luckily, none of our parents found out and we swore to take that secret to our graves.  
  
  
“What exactly do you have in mind?” I asked.  
  
“A scary story.”  
  
“Oh.”  
  
  
We’d been expecting something more complex so her answer caught us off guard.  
  
  
‘That’s it?” Tory asked, breaking the silence.  
  
“There is a catch,” Juna said, “but I can’t give it away just yet.  First thing, Saul, get more snacks.”  
  
  
I made some popcorn on the stove while things were set up. According to Juna, the ambiance had to be right before the story could be told. I added some butter and caramel seasoning, then transferred the popcorn to a bowl. My friends were all sitting on pillows in a circle. Juna had a flashlight and told me to get the lights.  
  
  
When I did, she switched the flashlight on and I sat between her and Zeke, then placed the bowl of popcorn in the middle of the floor.  
  
  
“Lights, check, flashlight, check, popcorn, check, nice and buttery too. Looks like everything’s ready,” Juna said.  
  
“Can we start now?” Lucia asked. “We’ve been waiting forever.”  
  
“I was getting to that.”  
  
  
Juna shined the flashlight under her chin.  
  
  
“What I’m about to tell is a story that goes back to the old days, about a man named Leland Suet.”  
  
  
According to Juna, Leland was an Amish butter maker whose obsession with the stuff was unmatched.  
  
  
“Day or night, he couldn’t go without it,” Juna continued. “His hunger for it was so great he’d hoard it which really pissed everyone off.”  
  
“Weren’t the other butter makers?”  Tory asked.  
  
“None were as good as him. In fact, he was so good that rumors began to spread that he made a pact with the devil for his amazing butter-making skills. People were a lot more superstitious back then so it didn’t take long for them to become paranoid. Even his own family turned against him and one day, they decided he needed to be taken care of.”  
  
“You mean they killed him?” Melvin said.  
  
“That’s right. Leland was dragged out of his bed one morning to the town square.”  
  
  
  
I was munching on some popcorn and spoke through a mouthful.  
  
“Geez, they didn’t offer him anyway out?”  
  
“They did, but it was something he couldn’t give up. They said he’d be let go if he told them where he kept all his butter and he told him he’d rather rot in hell than part with it.”  
  
“So what happened to him?” Lucia asked.  
  
“They burned him and he swore revenge, screaming that one day he’d be back to exact his vengeance. Do you know what the crazy part was? The people who witnessed his execution swore that they couldn’t smell him burning. They could only smell butter melting.”  
  
“So is that it?” Zeke asked, grabbing a handful of popcorn.  
  
  
Juna, deadpanned, shook her head.  
  
  
“No, in fact, it’s just the beginning. He burned until he became ash and got blown away. They thought they were done with him, but they were dead wrong. After his death, butter would mysteriously show up everywhere, under people’s beds, on their roofs, and in their shoes. Even the leader of the town would wake up covered in it. Nobody could explain how or why this happened, but deep down they knew it was a warning from Leland. Then there were the murders.”  
  
“Murders?” Melvin said, parking up.  
  
“That's right. It began small at first, accidents, people going missing, but then there were screams throughout the village and people found their families mutilated and somehow having been boiled alive. The strangest part was in every instance, they always smelled butter on their dead loved ones. Eventually, not a person in the village was left alive.”  
  
  
There was a moment of eerie silence as we let her story sink in. Zeke was the first one to comment.  
  
  
“I mean, that story was cool and all I guess, but I’ve heard ones that were way scarier. What makes it so special?”  
  
  
In situations such as these, Juna would usually get defensive and say that Zeke didn't know what he was talking about. This time, she only smirked.  
  
“Because it's true.”  
  
  
We scoffed at her claim.  
  
  
“Yeah, right,” Tory said, “you honestly expect us to believe a bunch of people were murdered by some weird butter ghost?”  
  
  
Juna’s expression did not falter.  
  
  
“There’s a ritual to summon him.”  
  
“What?” Tory replied.  
  
“A ritual, if you don't think he’s real why don’t you nut up and try it?”  
  
  
Tory let out a laugh in which I detected undertones of nervousness.  
  
  
“Oh, yeah, of course, why wouldn’t I? What do we need for it anyway?”  
  
  
The following items were necessary for the ritual, some candles, a red writing utensil, a stick of butter, some sugar, a mixing bowl, a wooden spoon, and a slice of bread.  
  
  
“Are you sure this is everything?” Tory asked.  
  
  
The supplies were laid out on my bathroom sink. On the mirror written in my mother’s lipstick were several Latin phrases in a circle with a stick figure of a dairy cow in the middle.  
  
  
“Yes,” Juna replied, “and once we light the candles, you are going to cream the butter, then say the phrase to summon him three times.”  
  
“And what's that?”  
  
“I do believe it's butter. Remember, you have to mix faster each time you say it. Got it?”  
  
  
Tory nodded and turned back to the mirror.  
  
  
“I do believe it's butter,” he said, stirring.  
  
  
He mixed faster.  
  
  
“I do believe it's butter.”  
  
  
He went as fast as he could.  
  
  
“I do believe it's butter!”  
  
  
Tory was creaming at such speeds that butter was getting everywhere. I even found my heart racing. Then Juna let out a blood-curdling scream that nearly made me jump out of my skin  
  
  
“What?” Zeke yelled at her. “What is it?”  
  
“Oh god, I see him.”  
  
  
We looked around, not sure what she meant.  
  
  
“What are you talking about?”  Tory asked. “I’m the one doing this and I don't see it.”  
  
  
Juna looked down.  
  
  
“I’m the only one who sees it then.”  
  
“You see what?” I asked, alarmed.  
  
“That you’re all…A bunch of suckers!”  
  
  
My blood went from chilling to now flowing rapidly to my face. I imagine the others were experiencing a similar sensation.  
  
  
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Tory snapped at Juna who was currently doubled over with laughter.  
  
“You made us waste all this time for one of your cheap pranks?” Melvin said.  
  
“And I can’t believe you all bought it! Really? The Butter Man? How gullible can you be?”  
  
Lucia balled up her fists and I stepped. Even though we felt Juna deserved it, I had promised my parents I would be responsible and couldn’t allow any fights to break out.  
  
  
“Let’s go,” I said, and everyone followed except Juna. “Wait,” I told her.  
  
  
Still laughing, she wiped a tear away and stared at me.  
  
  
“Enjoy sleeping in the garage.”  
  
  
Her laughter stopped.  
  
  
“You can’t do that,” she objected. “It was a prank. Don't be such a pussy about it.”  
  
  
My gesturing at the mess in my bathroom that her prank had caused made her shut up.  
  
  
“Now if you wouldn’t mind getting out of my way, I have some cleaning to do.”  
  
  
Glaring, she stormed off. It didn’t take long to clean up the bathroom. Then I remembered that I told my parents I’d do the dishes while they were gone. I’d put it off and nearly forgotten about it. Part of me wanted to put it off, but knew if I did it would slip my mind again.  
  
  
I got to work on it, scrubbing away.  I became famished halfway through  
so I toasted some bread and made a late-night snack of PB&J with sliced banana before getting back to work. Juna came into the kitchen when I was almost done.  
  
  
I heard her come up behind me.  
  
  
“Don’t even think about it,” I told her.  
  
“You’re no fun,” she huffed.   
  
  
She gave another smirk.  
  
  
“I got you guys good, though. Didn't I?”  
  
“Yeah, I guess you did,” I admitted and smiled. “How’d you come up with that story anyway?”  
  
“I didn’t come up with it. That all actually happened.”  
  
  
I turned to her.  
  
  
“Wait, seriously?”  
  
“Yeah, Leland Suet used to live in our town as a matter of fact.”  
  
“What about the stuff that happened after he died?”  
  
  
Juna shrugged.  
  
  
“Most people chalked that up to sudden death syndrome and paranoia. All it would take is someone putting butter at a murder scene and a bunch of superstitious nutjobs would lose their minds.”  
  
“That makes sense I guess. What about the ritual?”  
  
“I learned about it from my grandpa. The only part I added was saying “I do believe it's butter”. Supposedly, it counts as long as you say the word butter three times while doing the ritual. Other than that, I got you guys to follow it almost perfectly.”  
  
“What do you mean almost?”  
  
  
I focused back on finishing the dishes.  
  
  
“Oh, well, I forgot to mention it, but the bread we used was supposed to be toasted.”  
  
  
I stopped.  
  
  
“What is it?” Juna asked.  
  
“Nothing,” I replied, giving a slight head shake. “Anyway, we should get to sleep. The others probably aren’t mad at you anymore so you can sleep upstairs.”  
  
  
I put the last of the dishes in the washer and turned it on. I glanced at the stove clock, seeing it was two in the morning. Juna and I went upstairs to join the others. I went to my room and Juna joined Lucia in one of the guest rooms. All in all, I’d say we had a fun sleepover and I was worn out from the night’s activities.  
  
  
I was asleep shortly after getting into bed. Shrieking jolted me awake. I sat up, seeing only an hour had gone by. I poked my head out of my room and saw the others were doing the same.  
  
  
“Did you all hear that too?” I whispered.  
  
  
They nodded.  
  
  
“Wait, where’s Tory?” I asked, noticing he was missing.  
  
  
He’d been bunking with Zeke.  
  
  
“He told me he was going to get some water. Shit, we better check on him.”  
  
  
We made our way to the kitchen where a gruesome sight greeted us. It was Tory. His blood was pulling all over the floor from a chest wound and his head was twisted backward. Given the circumstances, we thought the best course of action was to calmly alert the authorities. By that I mean, we freaked the fuck out.  
  
  
“Jesus fucking Christ almighty,” Melvin said.  
  
“He’s fucking dead,” Zeke shrieked.  
  
“Who could have done something so horrible?” Lucia asked in shock.  
  
  
Then we noticed something sticking from Tory’s mouth. To our further shock, it was a stick of butter. Wide-eyed, we looked at Juna. She returned a similar look and began backing away as we approached her.  
  
“You guys can’t be serious! You actually think I’d do something this fucked up? For god sake, Lucia, you can vouch for me. Do you remember me leaving the room?”  
  
“No,” Lucia admitted, “but I was asleep so I can’t confirm you stayed there either.”  
  
  
Juna cried about how she was innocent and didn’t want to spend the rest of her life in jail. I didn’t want it to be true, having known her since we were little. Unfortunately, the present evidence offered no other explanation. Aside from that, my stomach knotted at the thought of Tory’s parents receiving the news of their son’s death.  
  
  
“I’ll call the police,” I stated. “In the meantime, you all keep an eye on-”  
  
  
Suddenly, the power went out. Panicked yelling filled the darkness.  
  
  
“Everyone shut up,” I snapped. “There are some flashlights under the sink.”  
  
  
We switched them on, gaining visibility again. It was then we realized that Lucia was now missing.  
  
  
“What is she thinking?” Zeke asked. “Hasn’t she seen any horror movies? You are never supposed to split up!”  
  
  
We walked around the house for a bit, not finding any sign of her. That is until we got to the door connecting to the garage. felt something drip onto my head. I reached up and wiped it away and saw my fingers were now coated in blood. Shaking, I cast my gaze upward.   
  
  
  
Poor Lucia was pinned to the ceiling by a bunch of kitchen knives, causing blood to pour from her body. To make it even more fucked up, we could hear her whimpering briefly before falling still. Like with Tory, a stick of butter was sticking from her mouth.  
  
  
“Now do you all fucking believe me?” Juna shrieked. “I told you all it wasn’t me! There’s some sick fuck taking us out.”  
  
  
In a flash, she drew a knife from her pocket. Her dad had given her one for protection and she now brandished it with a trembling hand.  
  
  
  
“Wow, Juna…” Melvin said, raising his hands.  
  
  
*Please don’t tell her to relax or calm down.*  
  
  
“Relax.”  
  
  
*God damn it.*  
  
  
“You want all want me to relax after you said I was a murderer and now we’ve found two of our friends dead so no I will not relax because I don't who the fuck I can trust anymore.”  
  
  
  
  
  
Even though I thought it would be a wasted effort, I attempted to talk her down.  
  
  
“You’re right,” I told her. “I’m sorry for doubting you and thinking you’d ever do this to one of us. We all are, but there’s no way any of us could have done that.”  
  
  
I cocked my thumb upward. Thankfully, there was still some part of Juna’s shocked state that could see reason.  
  
  
“Okay, I’m just scared,” she admitted, lowering her knife.  
  
  
That was preaching to the choir. I was amazed I hadn’t shat myself yet.   
  
  
“We all are,” I said. “I say we get the fuck out of here and get to a neighbor’s place.”  
  
“Good idea,” Juna replied, “come on, we can leave through here.”  
  
  
She placed her hand on the knob, then stopped.  
  
  
“What are you waiting for?” Zeke asked.  
  
“It’s stuck.”  
  
“What do you mean it’s stuck?”  
  
“Exactly what I just said!”  
  
  
We all tried the door to no avail. We raced to the front door and got the same results.  
  
  
“Who’s doing this?” Melvin asked.  
  
  
I’d already pieced it together by then. However, I didn’t speak up about it out of denial.  
  
  
“We can worry about that later,” Juna said. “Right now, we need a way out of here. Let’s break-”  
  
  
She stopped mid-sentence.  
  
  
“Juna, are you okay?”  
  
  
Her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she fell forward, showing that a butter knife was protruding from her skull. I don’t mean a knife for spreading butter either. It was a literal stick of butter with the blade of her pocket knife coming out of it.  
  
  
“No,” I roared, “Juna!”  
  
  
I fell to my knees. The friend Zeke and I had known for so long was dead. Cry as I might, that fact wouldn’t change.  
  
  
“It’s my fault,” I said.  
  
  
Melvin and Zeke were confused and asked me to clarify. I explained what Juna had told me earlier and how I made some toast.  
  
  
“You can’t believe that’s what’s causing all this,” Zeke said. “That’s ridiculous.”  
  
“I don't know what I believe, but if Leland is really here, we may not make it out of this alive.”  
  
“We will. Don’t worry.”  
  
  
No sooner than Zeke had said that, he was tripped up by an unseen force and dragged away.  
  
  
“Zeke!”  
  
  
Melvin and I raced after him. I tried shining my flashlight to see what was dragging him and only saw the air. He was taken to the bathroom, then the door slammed shut. Like with what happened earlier, it wouldn’t open.  
  
  
“Help me bust this thing down,” I said.  
  
  
We slammed our shoulders against it. Zeke pleaded on the other side of the door.  
  
  
“No, please, anything but that!”  
  
  
At last, we managed to break the door open. The sight before us is something that will haunt me into my twilight years. Zeke was now lying dead in my bathtub which was filled with melted butter. He’d been boiled alive in the stuff. The butteriness had seeped into him like he was a Thanksgiving turkey.  
  
  
We threw up on the spot. Zeke was someone I’d known almost as long as I did Juna. Now, the two friends who’d been with me the longest were gone.  
  
  
“They’re all dead,” I said, trembling, “and we’re next!”  
  
“Get a hold of yourself!” Melvin said, shaking me by the shoulders.  
  
  
Just then, laughter echoed throughout the house. It was horrible like nails on a chalkboard in hell. Melvin and I exchanged a glance. Then we each took a deep breath and went out to face our foe. We found him in the living room, hovering above the floor.  
  
  
Based on his old-timey clothing, we knew who this ghost was. His skin was a lot paler in death and slightly translucent. His hair was red and he sported thick eyebrows plus a beard that reached down to his chest.  
  
  
“Leland Suet,” Melvin said in disbelief.  
  
  
Part of me was refusing to comprehend it as well.  
  
  
“That’s right,” he replied in a thick Irish accent. “You have no idea how long it’s been since I’ve been summoned. Being stuck in Hell does things to a man. Know what I mean?”  
  
“So you did sell your soul to the devil!” I said.  
  
“Only as I was being burned alive. I figured all bets were off by then. Whoops, sorry, if my ma knew I was betting, she’d whack me on the ears.”  
  
“Enough of this horse shit, you killed all of our friends and we’re going to make you pay.”  
  
  
Leland only laughed away my threat.  
  
  
“You’re all so simple-minded. You see, ever since I was a wee lad, nobody was there for me. Nobody supported me, but do you know what I always had by my side? Precious butter! The smooth creamy goodness always got me through days of work that left my body aching so I wanted to show my appreciation by becoming the best butter maker in my village.”  
  
  
  
Leland clenched his hands into fists.  
  
  
“But did anyone understand? No, they only wanted me to give them their butter, even my own family!”  
  
  
  
The furniture started levitating and the lights were now flickering. Melted butter seeped from the ceiling and walls as Leland’s rage increased.  
  
  
“You all take butter for granted and I will make you pay for such blasphemy.”  
  
  
  
He made the couch fly toward us. We got out of the way and ran into the kitchen. It was no use trying to escape. Leland rose out of the floor in front of us and grabbed us by our necks.  
  
  
“I have something special planned just for you two!” he grinned, lifting us.  
  
“Let us go,” I desperately demanded.  
  
  
His grip tightened.  
  
  
“Sorry, laddie, I wish I could, but your souls will make fine eating down in Hell, especially after you’ve been butterbasted!”  
  
  
He stomped and the kitchen floor opened up to reveal a flaming cavern. The screams of the damned came from it along with demonic laughter. We shrieked in terror, begging him not to drop us in.  
  
  
  
“For the butter,” Leland said, “prepare to be…”  
  
  
His eyes twitched.   
  
  
“As I was saying, prepare to be…”  
  
  
They twitched again and he dropped us. Suddenly, he began itching himself all over.  
  
  
“What in blazes is going on?” he demanded, vigorously scratching himself. “Damn it all! I can’t finish the job like this. You two got lucky this time, but mark my words I’ll be back for you eventually!”  
  
  
Still dragging his nails rapidly across his back and chest, he jumped into the portal to Hell. When he did, the lights came back on.   
  
  
“Is it over?” Melvin asked.  
  
“I think so. I have no idea what just happened.”  
  
  
I started getting itchy. Glancing down, I saw small black dots moving on my arm. I shot a sharp look at Melvin.  
  
  
“Okay, I may have lied earlier.”  
  
  
  
Later, we were answering questions from the cops as best we could. Neither of us knew what to say. We came up with some break-in story and told them we hid away while the events unfolded. We sat out on the curb in front of our house while our parents were called.  
  
  
“This night fucking sucked,” I said.  
  
“At least we survived.”  
  
“All our friends are dead and you gave me fleas.”  
  
  
  
Needless to say, the night’s events put a damper on the rest of my Spring Break. Talk of what happened spread throughout the town and I spent the next week attending various funerals after getting the flea problem taken care of. Ever since what happened, I’ve never been able to bring myself to put butter on anything, not even popcorn or toast. It’s been over twelve years since then. I wanted to put what happened behind me.  
  
  
A few days ago, though, I came across something on Facebook that filled me with dread. It was a memorial for Melvin. We’d fallen out of contact after graduation. I did some digging and learned that he was found in his car on the side of the road. The authorities were baffled by his death.   
  
  
Somehow, a bunch of softened butter had filled his car, suffocating him. I’m the only one who knows the truth. What made me decide to write this post was a message they found carved into his dashboard.  
  
  
“You butter believe I’m coming for that ass.”
