I’d only been dating my girlfriend for two months. Honestly, you could hardly even call it a real relationship yet. But strangely enough, she invited me to her cousin’s wedding. I felt a little nervous about it, though deep down I was glad she was taking things seriously enough not to shy away from introducing me to her family. I was worried about what they might think of me. Emilia was a jackpot. Not only incredibly beautiful and charming, but also devoted and always cheerful. Like something a person would dream up for themselves — that’s how she felt to me. I honestly couldn’t understand what she saw in me. I never thought of myself as anything special.

But it wasn’t a dream. We were sitting in my car, pulling into the courtyard of Emilia’s family farm. Supposedly, her family was insanely wealthy — or so I gathered — because their estate was so large that we’d been driving off the main road for almost an hour since leaving the little town where she’d said the land was already her father’s property. I’m pretty sure they owned several hectares.


“Are you nervous?” Emilia asked sweetly, snapping me out of my thoughts as she touched my shoulder.


I just gave her a nervous smile. Of course I was nervous, but I didn’t want to say it out loud. Her father was probably some filthy rich landowner or something — who knows. One thing was for sure: this wedding wasn’t going to be simple.


The whole place felt strange. Emilia left me in one of the rooms in the house for almost the entire afternoon. Supposedly, it was all a family thing, and she asked me to just rest — I’d driven a long way, and we’d be celebrating later that night anyway.

The ceremony itself was beautiful. They held it on the farm, inside a church that, according to Emilia, her great-grandfather had built on the estate long ago. But the whole thing felt oddly lifeless, as if everyone there had already been through it before — that’s how they acted. Emilia was a bridesmaid, so I was left alone for almost the entire event. Honestly, I didn’t even understand why I was there: just a guy in the early stages of dating a girl, sitting at her cousin’s wedding. I was completely out of place, like someone who’d ended up there by accident.

Finally, when the ceremony was over, Emilia came back to me.


“I’m sorry, Frank,” she said, giving me a quick kiss. “I know I’m leaving you alone a lot, but my parents are really old-fashioned.”


“It’s fine, Em,” I waved it off. “We’ll dance at the party.”


She kissed me again before hurrying off to the family photo shoot. I watched her relatives from a distance — they all seemed so theatrical. Maybe it was just my nerves, but it was like they’d done this exact photoshoot countless times before.

Then someone called out that we could head to the dinner tent. Not far from the big house stood a massive white marquee. That’s where the dinner, the party, and the drinking would last until morning, celebrating the wedding. Em didn’t come with me there either; she was still caught up in family photos. I walked over with a few guests and distant relatives, only to be hit with another surprise: I’d been placed at a strange table. According to the seating chart, I was at a large round table with a completely random assortment of people. Naturally, Em was seated at the family table — far away from me. This wedding was getting worse by the minute.


I figured everyone had been waiting for dinner, because the tent filled up fast. At least at my table, every seat was already taken. It was like no one there actually knew each other. At the other tables, people were chatting, laughing, telling stories — you could tell they’d known each other for years. But at ours, it felt like sitting on a bus with a bunch of random strangers: awkward smiles, the occasional attempt at small talk, but the whole thing stayed uncomfortable and distant.


“I’m Carter,” said the man to my right suddenly, holding out his hand.


He looked a little drunk, but not to an obnoxious degree.


“Frank,” I replied, shaking his hand.


“Who are you here with?” Carter asked before taking a big swig from the beer in his hand.


“My girlfriend’s one of the bridesmaids,” I told him. “She’s also the bride’s cousin. What about you?”


“Oh, I’m just the groom’s mailman,” Carter said with a straight face.


I laughed. I figured he was joking — or maybe there was just something about this family I didn’t get. Either way, sitting there was painfully awkward. Luckily, the food was finally served before long. By then, every table in the tent was full, and everyone seemed to be busy with their dinner — or at least that’s what I assumed they were focused on.


The atmosphere was getting livelier — people were drinking, and some had even started dancing. But I still felt out of place. I’d barely seen Em all evening; why the hell had I agreed to come here? I’d even convinced myself she might introduce me to her father. I’d only seen him once during the wedding ceremony, talking with some older couple, not even glancing in my direction.

I decided to head to the bathroom. Besides, after all the drinks I’d had, I was barely holding it in. Outside the tent, there was a small structure set up with old-fashioned outhouse toilets. But the moment I stepped out of the tent, I nearly pissed myself on the spot.

An old lady was staring at me in the dark. Her eyes seemed to glint in the moonlight.


“Jesus,” I exhaled sharply. “You really scared me.”


The old woman shuffled closer in her little beige suit. I don’t like to be rude to the elderly, but she reeked — like she hadn’t bathed in weeks. Her face was pale and wrinkled, and her yellowish eyes seemed to glow.


“Are you feeling alright?” I asked, a little uneasy.


“Oh, dear,” the woman croaked in her raspy voice. “I’m feeling just fine. Did you eat much? Not too much meat, I hope?”


“Uh… well…” I stammered awkwardly. “Yeah, I ate.”


By then, she was right in front of me. Something about her was deeply unsettling — like she was starving for… something. She licked her lips, and I could swear I saw drool drip from the corner of her mouth.


“Oh, Grandma Zepro,” came a familiar voice from behind me. “Don’t start talking nonsense again.”


It was Em, hurrying over to the old woman. She hugged her and patted her gently. The whole thing was unbearably awkward, like everyone here was out of their minds.


“Frank, I’m sorry,” Em said, turning to me. “I’ll walk Grandma back inside, then I promise I’ll spend time with you.”


I just nodded dumbly. Right now, I just wanted to use the bathroom. And honestly, I was starting to get fed up with Em’s bizarre wedding — and, yeah, I was feeling a little hurt.


Still, I shouldn’t have been mad at Em. The rest of the evening actually went pretty well. Em spent most of the time with me.
We finally danced, had a few drinks, and she even introduced me to the newlyweds. They were nice — friendly, down-to-earth people.
We didn’t talk much, of course; it was their night, and they had plenty of guests to mingle with. 
But for the first time that evening, I felt more relaxed, not like I was stranded in a sea of strangers.

Sure, Em would occasionally stop to chat with someone, but it was always about ordinary stuff — how they were doing, how they liked the party, whether they were ready for the rest of the night, things like that.

But Em was clearly looking forward to something. She spoke to me with almost childlike excitement about the raffle, where they’d draw a guest’s name and that person would win something.
Anyone could be picked.  She even got me a little hyped for it, even though we had no idea what the prize would be.

Finally, around midnight, it was time for the raffle. Em told me it was a family tradition — they’d done it at every wedding since she was a kid.
I didn’t think much of it… until I suddenly heard my name called out loud.

I jumped up, startled. Everyone clapped and smiled — at least, most of them were cheering. I was the winner.
Great — the most random guy here just won the family raffle. 
That ought to make me popular.


“So, Em? What’s my prize?” I whispered to her, standing to my right.


Em just looked at me — maybe a little disappointed, but still smiling proudly. 
She didn’t say a word, just stared at me with those big brown eyes.


“Come with me,” said the bride, stepping up in front of me.


I hadn’t even noticed when she came over.
It caught me off guard, and the fact that she reached out her hand for me to take was even more unsettling. 
What did they want from me? Why couldn’t someone else have won this stupid thing?


“Em… I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. What is this?” I turned to her for help, but she just kept smiling at me, still looking a little downcast.


“Go with her, Frank,” Em said softly. “Please. If you do this, you’ll win the whole family over. Please, it’s tradition for us.”


Her pleading softened me a little, but I was still uncomfortable. 
Everyone was staring at me with these knowing grins. 
Why were they looking at me like that? What was I supposed to do?

The bride took my hand and led me away. 
I didn’t resist. I just hoped this dumb little game would be over soon so we could go back and pretend I was just some random guy at this wedding again.


“Carol, right?” I asked the bride as we slipped out of the tent through a back exit. “Where are we going?”


“Just shut up and come,” Carol said softly.


I felt awkward and uncomfortable. Carol was a young woman with short blonde hair, and my girlfriend’s cousin.
What the hell did she want from me, out here in the dark, in the middle of a field? 

She led me toward a small wooden shed, and when we reached it, she ushered me inside. A single dim lamp burned in the cramped wooden space.
It felt like I was a teenager again, hiding somewhere, nervously waiting for a first kiss. The whole thing was awkward as hell.


“Carol? Please, I don’t know what this is about, but I’d rather just go back.”


She just stared at me coldly.
All the warmth in her face was gone, replaced by a look of sheer contempt. 
Then, in one sudden motion, she shoved me hard against the wall. 
I glared back at her, now angry myself.


“Carol, I really don’t know what the hell this is. But please—stop.”


She stood with her back to the shed door, glaring at me. Then, with a sudden move, she slid the straps of her pretty pink dress off her shoulders.

I froze in shock. 
What the hell was this—some medieval bullshit? 
My prize for the tombola was supposed to be a wedding night with the bride?

But that wasn’t what happened. 

Carol’s shoulders popped out of joint at the same time, her arms stretching unnaturally long, her nails growing into massive claws. 
As I looked at her face, her once-pretty features sagged into wrinkled folds of loose flesh. Drool poured from her mouth, and her sharp, tiny teeth glinted yellow in the lamplight.

I didn’t even have time to process it. 
Carol’s long, clawed hand slashed at me hard. 
My jacket and shirt tore open instantly, and a burning pain shot through my chest. Blood seeped through the shredded fabric.
I collapsed to the floor from the pain, and she pounced again, driving her claws deep into my thigh. 
I screamed in agony.

But luck was on my side—if I hadn’t reached just a little farther across the floor, I’d probably be dead now. 
A pickaxe head stuck out from behind a small crate.

That was all I needed. 
My survival instinct kicked in.
I grabbed the pickaxe and swung it hard, burying it in Carol’s side. Carol—or the thing she had become—let out a piercing shriek, her yellowish eyes blazing with rage.
I didn’t hesitate. 

I yanked the pickaxe free and brought it down again with all my strength.
One of her arms came off almost on its own, spraying foul-smelling blood everywhere, but I didn’t stop. 
I swung again, splitting her skull open. 
I kept hitting, over and over, until she collapsed to the floor and the stench of her black, reeking blood filled the room.


I wrapped my jacket around my injured thigh. 
It was bleeding badly, so I had to do something. 
My thoughts were racing.
How could I have been so stupid? How could I ever believe a woman like Em would want me? And hell, we met on the damn subway… what was I thinking? Love at first sight?

But what pissed me off the most was this whole fucked-up game. 
I hadn’t won the tombola at all. 
I was the prize. Fucking monsters. 
I wasn’t going to die here.


“Darling, I hope you left some for me,” a voice called from outside. “The real party’s about to start inside…”


I kicked open the little wooden door and swung the pickaxe down. 
It was Carol’s husband, Tim. 
My attack caught him completely off guard—he didn’t even have time to react. 
One clean strike, right in the middle of his forehead. Tim collapsed, and I started hacking at him again with the pickaxe.

Then I heard the screams. 
They were coming from the tent—shouts, wails, death cries. 
And then I understood everything. Some of the guests had been invited here for one reason only: so these things could eat them alive.

A woman came running out of the tent, three grotesque creatures—just like Carol—chasing right behind her. 
They caught up in seconds, knocking her to the ground with their long arms, and started tearing her apart exactly as she was.

Fuck this. 
I was getting the hell out. 
My way out was my car. It was parked in front of the house, and the keys were in my room.
I was not dying here.


Luckily, the house was in the opposite direction from the tent. 

So I just limped toward the old manor. 
The creatures were still slaughtering the guests. Hellish sounds echoed from the tent, but I didn’t give a damn. 
There was no one left for me to worry about. Em was one of those twisted freaks too, and I’d even slept with her. 
The thought that I’d been deceived for months made my blood boil.


I smashed the front door open with the pickaxe. 
Thankfully, our room was on the ground floor, so I didn’t have to limp far to find it and grab the car keys.

There is a God—never would have thought it’d be this easy to get out of this hellhole. 
But when I stepped back into the hallway, there she was: the old hag I’d seen earlier, still drooling as she stared at me.


“What do you want, granny?” I growled, raising the pickaxe.


Zepro Granny didn’t answer. 
She just started swelling up, transforming just like Carol had. 
But this… this was something else. 
The hallway walls cracked as her arms shot out, her body twisting into a massive, wrinkled, greasy mound of flesh.

I stared in horror at the disgusting transformation, then heard sounds from the other end of the hallway, right behind me where I’d come in. 
Another creature stood there. It had a long neck… and even longer, clawed hands.

I moved fast.
I jumped back into the room and slammed the door shut.
I shoved a small dresser in front of it, then shoved the car keys deep into my pocket so I wouldn’t lose them.  I had just opened the window to climb out when a huge impact—or maybe an explosion—blasted me clear out of the room.

I sat up in the garden, gasping for air. 
The wall of the house was gone, replaced by a massive, pulsating tentacle. 
Dust choked me as I coughed. Two creatures were forcing their way out from the rubble of the collapsed section.

I had to get to the car. I had to get out of this place as soon as possible.


As fast as I could, I rushed to my car—my little green Ford.
I’d never been so happy to see it. There it was, untouched. The moment I jumped inside, the ground began to shake.

This was my last chance to get the hell out of here.
But when I turned the key and switched on the headlights, my stomach dropped—Em was standing just a short distance away from my car. 
She looked human… but her face and mouth were smeared with blood.

I just stared at her, hurt and betrayed.


“Frank, you can’t leave!” Em shouted.


“Oh, I’m leaving—and no one’s going to stop me!” I yelled back, my voice sharp with anger.


“Frank, please!” she continued. “You don’t understand. Zepro isn’t just anyone… he’s the Creator—”


I listened to her rambling in disgust, but then the ground shook again. My car jolted violently, and Em could barely keep her balance as everything trembled around us.


“Frank!” she screamed. “Please! Something terrible will happen if he can’t feed on your insides! Please!”


“Ask your fucking mother,” I muttered under my breath, and slammed my foot on the gas.


It could’ve been pure coincidence… or maybe the universe lining things up just right—but the moment  I hit Em with the car, the massive family house exploded. 
Her black, reeking blood splattered across my windshield, then spattered under my tires, jerking and spinning the car.

That’s when I saw what had taken the house’s place. 
The building’s remains were flung into the air—bricks, beams, chunks of wall crashing down everywhere. 

And in its place, a mountain of writhing flesh was growing. 
Tentacles whipped in every direction, dozens of yellow eyes glaring at the world, and at its peak, an enormous, gaping mouth yawned wide.

I think I’d just unleashed something ancient.
But I sure as hell wasn’t going to sacrifice myself to save this pack of degenerate monsters.

I floored it and drove away as fast as I possibly could.
