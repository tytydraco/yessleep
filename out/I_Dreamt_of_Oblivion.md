The wind howls like a wounded animal, pushing against a world that no longer breathes. Beneath my boots, gravel cracks like brittle bones. The air is heavy with dust — dead air for a dead earth.

Somewhere beyond the black horizon, the silhouettes of trees shimmer, too far to reach yet too close to ignore. I keep walking.

“We need to get out of the open,” I say, though the girl beside me barely hears.

She’s on her knees now, fingers clawed into the dirt, her hair matted with sweat and soil. “I’m tired,” she whispers, the words dry and hollow.

I want to tell her we’re safe — that there’s meaning to all this — but I can’t.  
“We’re almost there,” I lie.

She stumbles forward, her small hands reaching for me. I lift her onto my back, her arms a fragile weight around my neck. The warmth of her breath against my ear is the only proof that something living still follows me through this emptiness.

“How much farther?” she mumbles.

“Close your eyes,” I say. “If you imagine the trees hard enough, we’ll be there when you open them.”

She frowns. “That’s not how it works.”

“It is now.”

“One… two… three.”

We walk blind through the dark. Wind shrieks through invisible cracks in the air. Every step sounds wrong, like the ground isn’t real.

Then — *thump.*

It’s distant, but heavy. The sound doesn’t echo; it swallows the space around it.

“What’s that?”

“Keep your eyes closed,” I whisper, though my voice trembles.

We keep walking. Another *thump.* Closer. Louder. The ground quivers.

When I finally open my eyes, the trees are farther away than before.

“No…”

“We’re almost there?” she asks hopefully.

“Yes.” But my chest tightens. I feel something *listening.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

By the time we find the cave — a slit of darkness beneath a hill of stones — my body is breaking. Inside, the air tastes like rust, but it’s shelter. We sit together in the dim light, the girl curled against me.

“Eat,” I say, handing her a pack of stale crackers.

“I’m not hungry.”

“Eat anyway.”

She takes a bite, her eyes fixed on the cave mouth. Outside, the forest begins to move — trees bending in unnatural rhythm. The wind returns.

Then — *thump.*

Not wind. Breathing.

I press her head against my chest.

Something drags itself along the cave’s mouth — bone against stone, slow and searching. The sound crawls across the walls until it’s everywhere.

We’re trapped.

I don’t breathe.

I don’t look.

I only wish it would stop existing.

Then — silence.

We survive the night.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

When dawn comes (if it is dawn), the world hasn’t changed. The trees still shimmer wrong.

“I know where everyone is,” she says.

“Where?”

“They’re all dead.”

Her tone is too calm, too certain. I laugh, but it sounds cracked. “They’re not dead. You’ll see.”

We walk until the forest opens into streets. Houses stand exactly where they should, but something’s missing. The air doesn’t echo.

“This is where I grew up,” I tell her.

She looks up at a stop sign, tracing the letters with her finger. “What’s it do?”

“It keeps people safe.”

She smiles faintly. “Can it stop monsters?”

I don’t answer.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Inside my childhood home, the lights still work. The fridge hums. Everything is too perfect.  
I make her food. She draws.

When she runs to the bathroom, I glance at her paper.

Two stick figures under a stop sign. A dark shape looming over them.

The circle around the sign glows, protecting them.

My stomach drops. “What is this?”

She stands in the doorway, eyes wide. “It’s us. The sign keeps us safe.”

“How do you know about that thing?” I grab her shoulders. “Did you *see* it?”

She flinches. “I dream about it. It’s chasing me. That’s why everyone left. Because it wants me.”

I hold her, though my mind screams denial. “No… it’s after me. It’s *my* fault.”

She closes her eyes. “We’re safe now.”

I want to believe her.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Night falls again. The air thickens. I pack food, water, a gun. I tell myself I’ll draw it away from her.

“Where are you going?” she asks from the hallway.

“Back soon.”

“You’re leaving me.”

“You can’t come.”

“Please—”

The house trembles. The *thump* shakes the walls.

I raise the gun, not to shoot her but to make her stay. “Don’t follow me.”

Her eyes overflow. “You’ll come back?”

I turn away. “I promise.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Outside, the world quivers. The sound grows until it feels like thought itself is vibrating.

Then — her scream.

I turn. She’s standing in the middle of the street, frozen, her eyes locked on something behind me.

“Don’t—” I start, but my voice dies in my throat.

She’s seeing it. The thing we were never meant to see.

Her pupils widen until there’s nothing but black. Wind tears at her hair, her clothes, her voice.

“Look at me!” I shout, voice cracking. I refuse to turn around. I run to her, arms outstretched, eyes locked on the ground.

But the air thickens. The space between us folds like a curtain of water.

I hear her voice, a whisper: “I see it.”

And then — she vanishes.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I wake in my dorm room, drenched in sweat. Afternoon sunlight leaks through the curtains. My phone vibrates — missed calls from my mother.

“It was just a dream,” I whisper.

But something’s in my pocket. I unfold it.

A child’s drawing. Two stick figures beneath a stop sign. A dark shape above them.

Outside, a faint *thump* echoes through the floor.

The walls breathe.

Maybe if I don’t look—  
Maybe—

Thummp.
