Hey everyone, I’m Rosie, 23, from the UK, and I’ve been on Fansly since 2023. I’ve debated sharing this because it’s honestly one of the most shocking things that’s ever happened to me. But I think it’s important to get it off my chest, so here it goes.

So, for some context, my family is pretty close-knit. They’ve always been supportive, but they have no idea about my Fansly account. I’ve kept it completely separate from my personal life. Or at least, that’s what I thought.

About two months ago, I noticed a new subscriber who was really active on my account. His username was something generic like "BlueSkyWalker", and he wasn’t like most of my subscribers. Instead of the usual flirty or explicit messages, his were really personal, almost too personal. He’d ask about how my day was, comment on places I’d been, and even mentioned things that seemed oddly specific to my life.

At first, I didn’t think too much of it. Maybe he was just a super-dedicated fan who had been following me for a while. But then something happened that made me realize this was more than just a random fan.

One day, I posted a selfie on my Fansly account wearing a new necklace I had just bought. Nothing special, just a quick snap to share with my followers. Almost immediately, I got a message from "BlueSkyWalker" saying, “That necklace looks even better on you than it did in the shop.”

That comment stopped me in my tracks. I hadn’t mentioned where I got the necklace, and I definitely hadn’t posted about buying it anywhere else online. It was just a quick purchase I made at a local shop, and I couldn’t figure out how he knew.

Then it hit me. The day I bought the necklace, I was out shopping with my mom and my uncle. We’d gone to a few places together, and I remember showing them the necklace at the shop before I decided to buy it. That was the only time anyone had seen it before I posted it on Fansly.

My stomach dropped. There was no way a random fan could have known where I bought that necklace. It had to be someone who was there with me that day. I started to piece it together, the overly familiar messages, the weirdly specific comments, and now this. It was my uncle.

I felt sick to my core. This was someone I’d trusted my whole life, and the thought of him subscribing to my Fansly account, watching my content, and interacting with me like this was beyond disturbing. I didn’t want to believe it, but the evidence was right in front of me.

I knew I had to confront him, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it face-to-face. Instead, I sent him a message from my personal account, saying, “We need to talk. I know what you’ve been doing.”

He replied almost immediately, begging me not to tell anyone and claiming it was all just a mistake. He said he’d stumbled across my account and, out of curiosity, decided to subscribe. But the fact that he kept messaging me, knowing full well who I was, made it clear this was no accident.

I told him to unsubscribe immediately and to never contact me again, either on Fansly or in person, until I was ready. I also made it clear that if he didn’t, I’d tell the rest of the family. He promised he would, and thankfully, he did. But things have been really tense since then. I haven’t spoken to him, and every time we’re at a family gathering, I feel this overwhelming sense of betrayal and anger.

I’m sharing this because it’s a reminder that no matter how careful you are, you never really know who’s watching. Even the people you trust most can cross boundaries you’d never expect.

Thanks for reading, and please, be careful out there. Trust your instincts, and if something feels off, don’t ignore it.
