When I was a kid, my parents used to tell me stories about the Bonhomme Sept Heures (or "The Seven O’Clock Man" in English) which basically is a sinister old figure who snatched children who didn’t come home before dark. I always thought it was just one of those scare tactics adults used to make kids behave, something to roll your eyes at. And I did, until last month.

Let me back up a bit. I (27M) worked as a counselor at a kids' winter camp, and tradition wanted that at the end of each day, 2 or 3 counselors would tell the kids scary stories around a campfire while eating marshmallows. A classic summer camp stereotype you might say, but incredibly effective at delighting the kids, and the "Bonhomme Sept Heures" was always one of the favorite.   
So, I'd tell the tale of a hunched old man, dressed in tattered black clothes, who prowled the streets and fields at dusk. According to legend, he carried a large burlap sack slung over his shoulder, big enough to fit a child. According to the legend, he’d walk the streets whistling. A sharp, high-pitched sound, to lure curious kids into the dark. Once they came too close, he'd snatch them, stuff them into his sack, and take them away.   
Where ? No one knew. Some said to a hidden lair, others said to the woods. The stories varied, but the ending was always the same : the children were never seen again.

The kids loved it. They shrieked and laughed nervously, clinging to each other as the firelight danced on their faces. But for me, it was just that : a story. I’d never believed a word of it.

That changed on a bitterly cold night last December. It was a weeknight, and I’d been out running errands in a small Quebec town where the camp was located. Snow was falling steadily, muffling the world in a thick, eerie silence. The streets were nearly deserted, save for the occasional car crawling cautiously over the icy roads. My bags of groceries hung heavy in my hands as I trudged along the sidewalk, eager to get back to the warmth of my apartment.

Then I heard a child’s scream, high-pitched and panicked, echoing down the street.

I froze. It was the kind of sound that twists your stomach into knots. Looking around, I saw no one. The streetlights cast long, yellowish beams onto the snow, but the surrounding alleyways and doorways were shadows, dark and impenetrable. The scream came again, this time closer. Instinct took over, and I dropped my bags, calling out, “Hello ? Anyone needs help ?”

No answer.

The snow crunched behind me. I spun around, heart hammering, but saw nothing but my own footprints. The street was empty.

Then I heard a whistle. High and sharp, slicing through the silence like a knife.

My breath caught in my throat. It was just as I’d described it to the kids so many times. A chill ran down my spine, and not from the cold. I told myself it was just someone playing a prank, maybe a kid messing around. But then the whistle came again, closer this time, and I realized something else : it was coming from the direction I’d just walked. There were no footprints in the snow behind me.

And then, I saw him.

A figure emerged from the shadows of an alleyway, stepping into the pale glow of a streetlamp. He was tall and thin, impossibly so, his body wrapped in layers of ragged black cloth that hung off him like a shroud. His face was obscured by the brim of a battered hat, but I could see enough to know something was wrong. His skin was grayish, stretched taut over his sharp cheekbones, and his mouth twisted into a grotesque grin that revealed teeth far too long and jagged to be human.

Slung over his shoulder was a burlap sack. It squirmed.

I was frozen, unable to look away as he reached into the sack and pulled out a small, pale human hand. My stomach turned as I realized it belonged to a child. The figure held the limp arm as if inspecting it, then glanced up at me. Though his eyes were hidden, I felt his gaze lock onto mine, heavy and oppressive.

“You’re out late”, he rasped, his voice like the creak of a door hinge. He dropped the hand back into the sack, which gave another faint wriggle. “You shouldn’t be out so late.”

I stumbled back, nearly slipping on the icy sidewalk, and bolted. I ran faster than I’ve ever run in my life, the sound of crunching snow and that damn whistle chasing me all the way home. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t.

When I finally slammed the door behind me, I locked every bolt and turned off all the lights. For hours, I sat in the dark, trying to convince myself it was just a trick of the light, a figment of my imagination. But when I finally worked up the nerve to look outside, the snow in front of my building was undisturbed. No footprints. Nothing to suggest anyone had been there.

Except for the faint imprint of a sack, dragged through the snow.

I haven’t told this story to the kids at camp since that night. I’ve tried to forget it ever happened.
