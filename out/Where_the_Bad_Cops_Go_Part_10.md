Turns out I wasn’t as far from Tomskog as I’d anticipated. After a couple of hours, I saw a road in the distance. That, in turn, lead me to a crossroads. There was a sign pointing me towards the highway, allowing me to orient myself. Basically, I could head west towards the highway and hope a good Samaritan picked me up before Hatchet did, or I could take a longer route back towards Tomskog and hope I ran into someone who could give me a hand.

I didn’t like leaving it up to chance. The devil you know, and all that. I couldn’t stick around town, that much was for sure. The sheriff had pretty much just handed me over, no questions asked. I’m sure Nick was pissed about it, but I couldn’t imagine him giving me a hard time about packing my bags and leave. It’s not like there was a warrant out for my arrest or anything. If anything, Hatchet would be keeping their distance; there was no way to know what I’d told people, or what preparations I’d made.

So yeah, back to Tomskog was the plan.

 

I made my way back to the gas station on the outskirts of town. It was a roundabout kinda way to get there, but it was familiar and the people who worked there had seen me and Nick countless times. I was sure they’d let me use the phone if I asked nicely. I left Allie’s empty gun behind. The damn thing was some sort of internal security model with a disengaged bio-lock, and the weight of it had thrown me off anyway.

I got in line behind a man in a trucker cap and waited patiently for my turn. Just as I was about to ask the cashier to borrow their phone, the man in the cap turned to me.

“Ain’t you Nicky’s partner?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

“I’m Tom,” he said. “Tommy. Nicky’s brother.”

 

I stepped out of line and shook his hand. I’d heard Tommy mentioned a couple of times, but had only met him in passing. The two looked nothing alike. Nick was losing hair, while this guy was half-Sasquatch. I could barely see his mouth move under all that beard. They had the same eyes and cheekbone though – the resemblance was there.

“You alright?” he asked. “I ain’t tryin’a bust your chops, but you got pine in your hair, loafers, and a hoodie. Ain’t exactly autumn gear.”

“Was in a bit of an accident,” I admitted. “Was about to call Nick about it.”

“You got car trouble?”

“Nah. You wouldn’t mind giving me a ride to Nick’s, would you?”

“’Course not.”

 

We listened to a podcast on speaking Italian while we drove away. To quote Tommy, he was ‘dating an Italian chick and wanted to be prepared if they were gonna capiche him’. I swear to whatever deity there is that he sounded exactly like Brad Pitt from ‘Inglorious Basterds’. I thought he was joking for a second, but Tommy was 100% honest. Kinda stupid, but honest. I guess it ran in the family.

We stopped at Nick’s, and Tommy decided to come along to drop some stuff off. Mostly groceries. He stepped inside like it was no big deal, almost forgetting to mention I was even there. Nick was slouching around in his kitchen, having a smoke, when he spotted me. He almost swallowed his own tongue.

He stumbled over a couple of words before he attacked me with a drawn-out hug. The man smelled like an open bag of moist Cheetos, but it was nice to see him. Tommy didn’t seem to get the big idea. To him, we were just on a sort of temporary administrative leave – he apparently had no idea about the context. Maybe that was for the best.

 

Tommy left, and I filled Nick in – but he had the courtesy of taking a proper shower first. I explained about the facility, about the way Digman ruined it, and what happened to my caretaker. I explained that I had no idea what’d happened to Hank Dudley or the rest of the escapees, but Nick was way ahead of me there. Apparently, Hank Dudley had been found with a gunshot wound to the temple. Tomskog PD had gotten specific instructions to stay as far away from that whole ordeal as possible.

“And they put me on ‘administrative leave’ as soon as the nabbed you,” he explained. “It seems like watching your partner get semi-legally kidnapped makes you a bit of a liability.”

“But you’ll be back on the force in a bit then.”

“Maybe,” he sighed. “But I ain’t sticking around to figure that part out.”

 

Nick explained the situation. As he did, he fried up some sausage and pasta. It smelled like a grease fire waiting to happen, but at least it wasn’t what I’d eaten from a tray back at Hatchet. It was made in an actual kitchen, in a frying pan.

The idea was for Nick to get back on the force at the start of October – or at least to come in for a reevaluation. The sheriff was going to need all hands on deck for New Year’s, and Nick was one of his go-to guys. They’d been through a lot together.

“And we have,” Nick said. “But I don’t think he remembers what it’s like working with people. They’re only replaceable for so long, you know?”

“So if you’re not going back, what’s the plan?”

“I’m thinking Kansas City,” he smiled. “Maybe Dallas if I feel up for a drive. Know some people there.”

“You’re leaving?”

“Why the fuck not?” he shrugged. “I ain’t got shit waitin’ for me in this town. And I bet I get to shoot a lot more folks around central Dallas.”

“You really want that, Nick?”

“It’s a figure of speech.”

“It really ain’t.”

 

We finished dinner, watching an old episode of Top Gear. Nick knew all the lines and kept handing me unwanted trivia. I didn’t really see the appeal. Just looked like grown men playing with cars and taking turns calling each other slow, fat, or short. As the episode came to an end, and the streaming service paused on a still image of the title screen, Nick sighed.

“I’m glad you’re okay,” he said. “I tried, you know. But they took my gun, and-“

“I get it,” I said. “Hatchet fucking runs this town.”

“They run a lot of towns,” Nick added. “And they cut me off completely.”

He put away his empty plate and reached for a cigarette. Just as he grabbed the package, he sighed again, and let the thing rest on the table.

“Would you mind if I came along?” I asked. “To Dallas?”

“You sure?”

“Yeah.”

“Alright.”

He ruffled his hair a little and reached for the remote. I searched his features for a hint of lie, or sarcasm, but Nick wasn’t like that. It was just one of those things that didn’t need any further discussion. Guess we were going to Dallas by the end of the month.

 

There was a bit more to it. My place had been seized and condemned under the guise of a health hazard, so I (once again) had to stay at Nicks’ for the time being. Nick was gonna have his brother sell the house once we were out of town. I didn’t really have anything to contribute, but Nick was as gracious a host as ever. I think he’d missed me, in his own way. Besides, he was, to quote, ‘expecting his brother’s life insurance to kick in any day now that he’s dating that Italian chick’. Apparently that woman had five brothers – one of which literally drove a garbage truck. Waste disposal.

It was nice to have an endgame – leaving town. Letting Tomskog deal with itself and just start over somewhere new. Sure, it’d be difficult getting a new job with the police down south, but there were a lot of opportunities for ex-cops. Nick had an old buddy from high school who’d talked about a bouncer gig in Fairview, so there were already some feelers out.

But that’s also where a troubling thought began – feelers.

 

While my SORE infection was still held in check, there were a couple of questions still left unanswered. How would it affect me in the long run? And yes, while I wasn’t infectious, did that mean I would have no adverse effect on others at all? What if I started dating someone, could I kiss them without worrying about them getting strangled from the inside out? It was a disturbing thought, but it would have to wait.

After about a week back at Nick’s place, I was getting into a bit of a routine. I stayed out of sight and tried to keep a low profile without being all too suspicious. I didn’t necessarily hide, but I didn’t walk around out in the open during daytime either. But I still made my way around town, especially in the dark. I even went grocery shopping a couple of times.

But it’s on those little nights out that I started to notice a couple of things.

 

First thing was by Frog Lake. Nick and I’d had to go by there a couple of times to cull the frogs, but now that I wandered by there was a large group of them dead – bobbing around in the water. It was possible that something else was killing them, and for different reasons than the Tomskog PD. It made me wonder what the PD was dealing with when Nick and I weren’t around to help.

Next was vandalism at the graveyard. A couple of gravestones had been knocked over and at least two freshly dug graves had been vandalized. There were warning signs hanging on the little stone wall outside. We’d never gotten any calls about that during my time at the PD.

But the thing that really caused me concern wasn’t even mine to discover – it was Nick who did.

 

He took me out in his car one day and stopped by a road not too far from his house, showing me a field. I didn’t get it at first, until I took a couple of steps closer and looked in the grass.

There were hundreds, if not thousands, of dried-out sunflowers resting in the grass. Most of them had long since lost their illustrious Tomskog Blue, but a couple of them still retained hints of it. They were dead as doornails, as if the ground itself was poisoned – or whatever sustained them had suddenly run out.

“In all my days, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Nick said, chewing on some gum. “This is absolutely beyond fucked.”

“You got any idea what did it?” I asked.

“I was hoping you’d tell me,” he said. “You’re the one who saw behind closed doors and all that.”

“Didn’t see anything that can explain this.”

“You sure?”

 

Thing is – I wasn’t. I didn’t know the intricacies of how the creatures in the Hatchet facility worked. Maybe they drank sunflowers like they were orange juice.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “There was a lot of weird stuff.”

“Anything weird enough to do this?”

“Perhaps, yeah.”

I didn’t like where my mind took me, and what it implied. There was a non-zero chance that this was Allie’s work. What might she have devolved into? No matter the answer, Nick was quick to pick up on my worries.

“I’ll check with Charlie,” he said. “She might have an idea.”

“Then what?” I asked.

“Well, then we’ll know,” he said. “And when you know, you know.”

 

Nick made a couple of calls to Charlie at dispatch. Not the official monitored number, but her personal one. It didn’t take long for him to get an idea about what’s going on. There’d been reports around town about a strange woman roaming around town. Apparently she had “really long white hair”. According to Charlie, there were whispers around the station about the woman being some kind of escaped subject from the Hatchet facility.

My blood froze. This was, without question, Allie. And chances were, she was still on the hunt. All these signs had been noticed closer and closer to Nick’s place. The frogs were downtown, the graveyard was just down the main road and across the street. The field was almost visible from his living room window.

 

I talked to Nick about leaving town earlier, but he didn’t want to draw any suspicion. Disappearing suddenly overnight wasn’t the same as accepting a position in another city after careful consideration. Nick didn’t want to draw too much attention and have the DUC or Hatchet come down on him – especially not when taking his new housemate into consideration.

So we did the second-best thing. We prepared ourselves.

Tommy had a couple of hunting rifles to lend us, and Nick had this idea of cleaning the outside of the house with chlorine to eliminate any of my smells. That might be enough to at least throw her off my trail for a bit.

After that, all we could do was wait.

Nick didn’t mind helping out. We were both stuck waiting out the month either way. He’d sit up late at night, listening to Top Gear on low volume while I slept – and we’d switch places early in the morning. This went on for a couple of days. It felt comforting, in a strange kind of way. Like we were back on the force, watching the Digman’s.

Then one night, I saw her.

 

It was almost 3 am when I saw something move out back. I woke up Nick, and we sat down with our scoped rifles at the ready. We couldn’t see a lot out there, but we could see her long, stripey hair. Except it wasn’t hair – they were white strands emerging from her eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Like her entire head was an overflowing toothpaste tube. It’d grown so long she dragged it behind her, like the macabre train of a wedding dress. It would snag against branches and leaves, forcing her to pull her head in random directions.

I cracked the window and took aim. It was dark, but I could see the white strands waving in the wind, even at a distance. But there was something else. She was running, and she was heading in a particular direction. Before I got the chance to figure out her target, there was a sound. A blood-curdling screech. She was tackling something out in the field.

Before I could pull the trigger, I noticed something.

She wasn’t alone.

 

“You seein’ this?” Nick whispered

He peeked out between the curtains, dressed in nothing but a pair of cargo pants. He’d been asleep just a minute earlier. Man looked like a 12-year-old boy, didn’t have a string of hair on his chest. It always made me chuckle.

He was talking about other shades out in the field, some following Allie, others going ahead. If we took a shot at her, we’d be pulling the attention of about a dozen people who were seemingly just as rabid. I didn’t recognize them from the facility, or the tunnels – had she infected the locals? I didn’t recognize them from around town either. Maybe they were passers-by, or people from truck stops along the highway. Strangers, essentially.

They brought down an animal. Something large. It screeched and stomped, but it was already over. And after about an hour or so, they all left. I put on my boots and wandered out.

 

The autumn cold burned my hands and sunk into the cold steel of the trigger. Hunting rifles aren’t as fancy as those high-tech handguns that Hatchet has, but you sure as hell know when they’re ready to go. I crunched through the crackling frosted grass only to see what remained of a doe in the field.

The doe was covered in white chemical burns, soaking right past the fur and into the top-surface meat. All in this swerving, organic pattern – like sleeping worms. Problem was, it was still alive – and there were strands of white coming out of it.

“Holy shit,” I whispered. “They can infect animals?”

“Looks like it.”

Nick didn’t waste any time, and quickly put a bullet in its head. I didn’t have time to stop him. There was no doubt those things would come back for us now – that sound traveled far. I grabbed him by the arm to pull him back to the house, but he just shook his head – still just dressed in his stupid cargo pants.

“No, see where they went?” he said. “North by northwest. Straight line.”

“They’re looking for me, there’s no chance they’ll-“

“They’re not looking for you!” he snapped back. “What’s north by northwest of here?”

I blinked. Holy shit, how could I have missed that?

 

We returned to Nick’s place. I checked the maps on his computer and facepalmed so hard I thought I was going to break my nose. Yes, all the signs had been pointing at them slowly making their way towards me, but it was also a straight line to another area further outside of town. Ranching land.

Digman’s place. The same that we’d kept under surveillance months back.

“They’re heading for Digman,” I sighed. “God fucking damnit.”

“Bet you a month’s salary that the Digman kid made his way back there when that Hatchet crap went down,” he said. “You take that bet?”

I did not.

 

We sat down and thought about it. We could just pack up and leave, and no one would be any wiser. They’d be busy sweeping up the bits and pieces of this nonsense for weeks. There’d probably be a couple of funerals as well. Nick and I were off the team – there was no reason for us to get involved. We could be out of town within the hour.

Then again, if we didn’t act, people might get hurt. Most probably so. Either way, we fetched our gear and made our way to Nick’s car. For a moment the two of us just sat there, considering our options. We were going somewhere, but neither of us could wrap our heads around the destination. Surprisingly, it was Nick who broke the silence.

“This is it, alright?” he said. “The last one. We do this last one.”

“Right,” I said. “Last one. Then it’s Dallas time.”

“Right,” he agreed. “Dallas time.”

He adjusted his pink sunglasses and rested his head against the steering wheel for a second – simultaneously cursing his own stupidity, and at the same offering a prayer.

Digman’s ranch was a bit out there, so we’d make it there by car far faster than they could make it on foot. Still, it was just a matter of minutes. Nick took a sharp turn, following the main road through town. He was a bit too used to driving a police vehicle – he was breaking several traffic regulations. Then again, there weren’t a lot of traffic cops in or near Tomskog anymore. Not with me and Nick off the force.

 

We took up position on a hill on an opposing side of Digman’s compound. We had a good view of the surrounding area and could clearly see the field on the southeast side of the property. If they were coming from anywhere, that’d be it. We’d be able to pick them off far in advance. So we got out, readied ourselves, and waited.

And that was that.

We waited for hours. There were no rabid beast-people coming to eat the Digman’s that night. As the clock rolled on, and late night marched into early morning, a frustrating realization dawned on us.

From this night on, we would have to watch the Digman’s again. At least if we wanted to clean this mess up before we moved on to greener pastures. Nick and I were on the same page here – it felt strange leaving this behind. Especially for me, considering that in a roundabout way, I was involved in letting Allie out.

It felt like coming full circle, in a way. Tailing and watching John Digman had been one of my earliest assignments in Tomskog – it was only appropriate that it’d be the last thing I did as well. I don’t think the irony was lost on Nick either. The following night, when we returned for our first “shift”, he’d already picked up hot dogs.

 

We spent a couple of nights out there. At first it was just because we wanted to make sure nothing would turn around and bite me in the ass, but it soon dawned on me what might really be at stake here. It wasn’t just about watching Digman’s back, if those things killed a Yearwalker, there was no telling what would happen.

Saying goes, if you kill a Yearwalker, you get their wish at the end of the year. What might a bloodthirsty, mindless creature wish for? Would I even want to know?

Nick had a slightly different take on it.

“They can’t make wishes,” he said, chewing some gum. “Gotta have souls to make wishes.”

“You think sick people ain’t got a soul?”

He looked up at me, obviously a bit taken aback. Maybe he’d forgotten that I was, for all intents and purposes, one of them. Nick just gave me a shit-eating grin and leaned back with his rifle.

“Nah,” he chuckled. “You deader than Jimmy Hoffa.”

I couldn’t help but to laugh. Who the hell pulls out a Jimmy Hoffa reference in this year of our Lord?

 

It took a couple of nights before we noticed some movement around Digman’s place. And not roaming monster-people, but a curious passer-by. That, and Digman’s place itself was pretty full of movement. Strange lights and movements in the middle of the night. Hard to explain, but I wasn’t there for that. I was there to make sure nothing tried to eat itself into a wish.

We thought about taking a shot, or going in closer to get a better look – but we couldn’t risk it. Someone passing by doesn’t mean ill-intent. Besides, the guy had a scarf. What kind of monster would dress up in a scarf?

By the time we’d made it down to the main road with Nick’s car, the guy was already gone. Maybe we’d been wrong.

 

We spotted that same person four more times over the following days. A single person with a scarf sneaking around outside. I think it learned to anticipate us, because it seemed to start running just before we even got there by car. They were out for something, but no matter how prepared we were we couldn’t get there on time. And Digman was nowhere to be seen as of yet. Maybe he, like me, wanted to keep out of sight for a bit until Hatchet calmed down and got off our back.

Finally, Nick and I decided to set up a bit of a trap. Instead of staying by the car up on the hill, we’d be waiting in the dark down by the road – weapons in hand.

 

Next night came around, and we were in position. We kept the car up on the hill to make it look like we were still up there, watching from afar. But we were actually on foot, down by the main road outside the compound – ready to step in and confront the stranger. If they were infected, we would have to deal with it.

We stayed quiet when we saw him coming down the road, we just kept our heads low. It was just some average man. His scarf looked like something he’d just thrown together, like a pair of cut-up old pants or something. Everything else looked fairly coordinated. It was strange, to say the least.

Unknowingly, I touched my own throat. I’d felt something tickle plenty of times, like I was a bad cough away from something breaking. Is that what’d happened to this guy?

 

He was just standing out there, as if waiting for us to come down the hill and chase him.

Then, a thought hit me.

He was stalling.

I turned my attention back towards the woods. Just as I’d suspected – we weren’t alone.

I slowly sunk into the underbrush, poking Nick at the side. He rolled his head around, and I saw the light in his eyes dull. We’d been tricked. It’d wanted us to catch it, so we would come down from that hill and away from the car. Now we’d walked straight into the trap, and we had no high ground to defend ourselves. By thinking ourselves the predators, we’d turned ourselves prey. We were being surrounded.

“God fucking damnit,” Nick whispered. “God. Fucking. Damnit.”

 

We kept our heads down, hoping they wouldn’t catch us anytime soon. I couldn’t see Allie among them. There were 8 in total, including the one on the road. Men and women of various ages, all with scarves covering their throats. Possibly to hide some kind of disfiguration, or to keep something in their throat safe from the cold. There was no doubt in my mind they were SORE-infected. I could feel it.

They moved between the trees, looking for us. Luckily, it was just as dark for them as it was for me and Nick – and Digman’s place had been powerless all night. There were no floodlights or streetlights. That made it hard to judge just how far away these things really were.

They weren’t speaking; they were clicking. It was such a miserable sound. Every time they clicked, I felt something inside me click back. Like something poking at my stomach. They were calling to me, and a part of me wanted to answer. I had to bite down on my lip so hard I almost bled.

 

One of them passed right by me and Nick. If it’d stumbled just a little, it would’ve fallen right on top of me. Instead, I heard it wheezing as it struggled to move. It was a strange noise – as if the breathing was coming from the scarf rather than the mouth or nose.

I couldn’t even see Nick. I couldn’t tell him what to do. If either of us moved, we’d be screwed. Problem was, whoever might move first could give the other a chance to run. That thought, in and of itself, made me look over in his direction.

He’d do it. I knew he would. That son of a bitch would do it at the first drop of a hat, and I’d have to live with it. Nuh-uh.

 

It all happened so suddenly. The moment my heart raced to catch up with my thoughts, something happened at Digman’s ranch. Flames sprouted out of a window. Alarms blared. Lights and sounds and fire, all  at once. Disaster had struck.

The whole forest lit up, illuminating dead, curious eyes. They were flabbergasted by the fire. I’d got up on my feet, ready to get locked and loaded – and apparently Nick had thought the same thing.

“Go!” he yelled.

“You fucking go!” I yelled right back.

With both of us too stubborn for our own good, I kicked him in the shin and popped one of the scarf people open like water balloon.

 

Maybe it was a combination of several things. The fire seemed to scare them, and we appeared out of nowhere. One of them threw herself at me, and for a split second that scarf gave way to these long white tendrils sprouting out of her neck like a hellish lotus flower. She was too close to shoot, so I could only push her off and wait for Nick to finish the deal. I didn’t have to wait long.

Bang. Ka-click. Bang. Ka-click. Bang.

A man dislodging his jaw like a snake, as if threatening to swallow me whole. A wounded woman scurried up a tree using only her legs. It’s as if these things were wearing people-suits, but were something far different underneath. Like they were straining against the confines of the human body. It stirred something in me, and it terrified me. It’s as if my heart was growing colder.

A final attacker reared his face from behind a pine tree and charged me. I had a bullet left. I raised my rifle and took aim, only to feel a tug on my hand. White strands, coming out of my own arm, holding back the trigger finger. I barely had a chance to react as he was close enough for me to smell the chemical burns. Nick shut him down with a final bullet to the neck.

 

There were a handful left, but they were far and few between. Somewhere in the distance, there was a noise. A vibrating yell. It wasn’t that loud, but something about it made the leaves rattle like a threatened snake. And despite it being nothing short of monstrous, there was something about the tone that made me shudder with recognition. It was Allie, all right. Or at least something wearing Allie like a cheap suit.

I got down on one leg and turned from left to right, sweeping the forest for those white strands to poke out at me. But they weren’t there. They were moving away. My trigger finger ached, and I looked down a couple of times just to make sure there’d be no more interruptions.

“We gotta go,” I said. “They’re coming back with more.”

“What? How?”

I didn’t know. It’s as if some part of me could feel what’s about to happen, and what they were about to do. A small part of me was already listening, and it was hard to stop. I shook my head, trying to set my thoughts straight.

“Let’s just go.”

 

We got back to the car up on the hill. We both collapsed against the front of the car, letting our feet rest for a while. That walk up and down the hill was brutal, especially in the dark.

“We’re gonna have to keep an eye out,” I said. “Didn’t see the big one.”

“Sounds like we’re putting Dallas on hold then,” he sighed.

“You can go, Nick. Really.”

He nodded, looking down the hill. Digman’s place was going up in flames. What the hell had they done in there?

“Yeah, I know,” he said. “I could.”

He leaned his rifle on his knee, looking down the scope. He elbowed me a little.

“You seeing that?”

 

Perry and John Digman, making their way out of the house. They looked defeated as they watched the fire. The kid looked emotionally destroyed, like he’d been through more than just a fire.

“You know, a clean shot would get you a wish,” Nick said. “Could get rid of that infection. Hell, could get you rid of that thing in the woods too.”

“Yeah, I know,” I said. “I could.”

I saw them through my scope. I’d taken harder shots against harder targets at longer ranges. But even now, something in me told me I couldn’t. Despite it all, I wasn’t about to let opportunism and instinct take over. Not that one night, at least.

Allie was still out there. I couldn’t leave the town to fend with that kind of thing on its own. In a way, it was my fault she was out there. Hell, maybe it was my fault she was the way she was – I don’t understand how this infection crap works. I just knew that I wanted to put her down and put this all behind me. To dot the i’s and cross the t’s before I rode off into the sunset.

To protect and serve.
