It was a couple months before I would speak to him again. The one guy who told me, in a public library, that I was “lucky I wasn’t one of the humans that was artificially created by aliens."

If you don’t know from my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pxrnnf/aliens_visited_us_but_no_one_remembers/), that’s pretty much the gist of him.

And again, my friends begged me to stay away from this person. To their credit, most sane people would say something like hey, probably don’t talk to people who have claimed they have met and were tortured by aliens. Really my friends were reasonably worried that I was going to be murdered by some random homeless guy I met in a library. I suspect they also thought I was borderline having a psychotic episode myself. I get it, I really do. 

But they hadn’t met him. They hadn’t been *read* by him.

I remember scrolling through his messages to me. Reading them over, making sure I got the all the directions right. Not in a careful “have I followed these correctly” kinda way, but more of a disbelieving “are you fucking kidding me, is this really what I have to do”, kinda way. 

Apparently, the only safe way to speak with him about anything was through encrypted messages through an E2EE messaging app. Not sure what that is but OK. Go off. That’s a download or two, not too hard. But also, it has to be done on a brand new pre-paid cellphone that I needed to purchase with a VISA gift card. A gift card, that needed to be purchased with cash in a location hours away from my home. This, you see, was the only safe way to communicate. For some reason.

Why bother, my friends asked. A couple things. One, I am obsessed with the truth about this world. I love the occult, the conspiracies, all of it. I’m not crazy mind you, it’s really a hobby for me, especially because any coherent logical reading of any paranormal phenomena, any conspiracy, ends up in a trash can labeled “probably didn't happen”.

This time though... 

I couldn’t help but open and re-read an e-mail I had. It was from my latest blood test results I had gotten a week ago.

“B+” it said. I didn’t know my blood type until then. Well, that’s a lie actually- the alien guy, who I had met months ago, took one look at me and told me what it was. Lucky guess you say. He then told me that I had twisted my ankle playing soccer a year ago, which was true. He knew where I had a birthmark, my family medical history, my exact eyesight… He roughly knew what I had eaten that morning. He knew my original hair color, before I dyed it. He knew I smoked weed once in college, but never liked it, and that I don’t drink much at all. 

A guy says something like that to you, tells you things he can’t possibly know, that you don’t even know, and you start to reconsider the part where he started talking about aliens.

I ended up being able to call him, finally, after decrypting the GGPG public key that he had sent. I have to say, I really hope he is just some homeless guy.

”Hello Isaac,” He spoke. He was a composed man, moreso than many people I’ve met, let alone someone who supposedly live on the streets. Right then though, he had sounded a little excited to have someone to speak to. 

”Hello alien man. I’ve looked very dumb and very suspicious in several local major retail locations because of you.”

“Well, luckily you shouldn’t be visiting those places anytime soon, since they should be hours away from your home address. Of course, that’s if you’ve followed my instructions.”

“Yes I made sure to follow your insane instructions. Can you please tell me more about the alien again now that I’ve suffered?”

He could barely stifle a chuckle. 

”The one you think I copied from Science Fiction?”

”Well, yes. You said its skin was gray, and that it had arms and legs or something like that. I’m just getting my bachelor’s in biology, Dr. Alien Man, but even I know that’s sci-fi crap from like Star Wars or Mass Effect or something. The chance that real aliens evolved to look anything like us, bi-pedal or whatever, is extremely low.”

”I suppose Dr. Alien Man works since I do have a PhD. Well, I guess had a PhD. I don’t think my credentials carried over to the New World created by the aliens. And while you’re mostly correct, I didn’t say it’s skin was gray, nor that it  evolved to look the way it does.”

“Wait, what? Then what *did* you say?”

He paused briefly, considering his words.

**”** I said it *chose* to look that way, Isaac. It’s no longer bound by what we understand as evolution. It took that shape to mock us.”

“Mock us? How can you know that?”

“You truly don’t understand even the beginnings of it. The alien wanted to expose the limits of our biology, to show us how fragile our pathetic species was. And yes... it tortured us. It enjoyed showing us what we could never understand, never become.”

I didn’t have much of a response to that, and let him continue.

"I can’t fully explain how far beyond us it was, Isaac. We never had a chance. Its biology was ahead of ours by thousands of years, maybe more. That gap gave it abilities we could never hope to understand—telepathy, psychophysical manipulation... it could control people, make them prisoners in their own bodies, witnesses to the things they did. No one liked to call it what it was, but it was essentially mind control."

"It could do more than that, though. It could move objects without touching them—telekinesis, I guess you'd call it. The thing’s presence was inside your mind, constantly. As easily as opening and reading a book, it could invade your thoughts, uncover your secrets, change your very desires. If it wanted, it could erase memories or rewrite your entire personality, and you’d never know it wasn’t yours."

He continued, speaking quickly, as if explaining critical information.

"We studied it in secret for a while, learned some things. Like I mentioned before, its abilities had limits. ‘Monitoring’ people’s thoughts was easy- it could hear and process thousands of minds at once, like background noise. But controlling someone fully—body and mind—that took more focus. It could maybe manage a hundred people at a time, at best."

”That doesn’t seem like too big of a deal, “ I finally said.

"”Do you know how many people control the world’s nuclear arsenal? How many cities would need to vanish before all of humanity pitifully surrendered to a new God?”

"I’m guessing... not many"

"Not many at all," He committed, pausing to take a sip of something.

I knew he loved tea from when I met him in a library. This time it was a long swig, and he drank deeply, like he was downing something stronger. I let him have a moment of respite to himself before speaking again.

"Uh, not to pry, but you seem really involved in this. What are you, exactly? A scientist? Who’s ‘we’?"

I’m not great at reading people, but his tone afterwards... I recognized it. It was the same way my dad used to speak to me when times were tough. Late at night, after working long hours, staring at bills he couldn’t pay. He’d look at me when I wandered into the same room as him, and I'd ask him what was wrong.

Nothing, he'd say, like he was tight in the chest, but I could tell he was holding in a sadness. It sounded like he’d been eating it his whole life. 

That’s what the guy reminded me of, anyway. 

"I was a fake," he said, as if confessing, "I worked with real scientists, sure, but only because I knew someone. Ken—he got me in. We’d been in the same PhD program, but I was burning out. He was becoming a professor, and he knew what was happening early on. So, I became part of the privileged few from the start, with his invitation. At first, it was just a handful of academics, a few government types, trying to understand what this thing was. Eventually, when we ran out of people and things got worse, we started bringing in others."

He paused.

"They were all braver than I was. Most of them didn’t make it. The ones that did might as well not have. That thing made sure of it. I can’t point you to any gravestones... nothing I say has any physical proof."

I couldn't help my curiosity, and couldn't leave him any longer to ruminate. I spoke to him-

“You seem... surprisingly sharp for someone who’s lost it. And well-read. I don’t think you’re making this up, the same way I don’t believe two perfectly identical craters just appear in town and no one has an explanation. So, yeah—I believe you. But I want the whole story. What was it really like, living under this thing?”

He shrugged.

“The worst parts? Well it's that life kept going. Work didn’t stop. It didn’t want to wipe us out—that would’ve been too easy. It was more like burning an anthill and watching the chaos. It forced society to keep moving, a sick parody of what it was before.

"A lot of people ended up in hard labor. I spent a year mining rocks. Twelve hours a day, hauling stones that meant nothing, while people dropped dead from exhaustion. We called them the lucky ones. At the end of the week, we’d drag these useless piles to the beach and throw them into the ocean. Then we’d start all over again.

"Buses still ran on time, better than before. Miss a stop by a minute, though, and the driver got flayed alive. Corporate meetings kept happening. It killed the loser of the World Cup final. Then sometimes, it killed the winner instead."

I objected.

“How could it control so many people? You said yourself it had limits to how many it could control at once"

He sighed.

“That must have been its favorite part. It had… followers. Those who, in absolute fear of what the alien could do them, worshipped it and offered themselves to it. It would rewrite their already willing brains, and . They had a uniform, bright pink, and they received what it called its commandments. Each day there would be new orders- new arbitrations we would have to follow. And its followers enforced them. Their reward was freedom from the pain, the fear of the hell around them.

"Not that selling your soul to that thing was a small price to pay. The disciples, as they called themselves, had long lost their humanity. Spiritually, they were mutilated, the alien made sure to take whatever we considered “good” in people and remove it, as if to prove a human was something like a toy, and that the inherent virtue we grew to value as a species was actually just a part of a machine that could easily be removed. "

I could feel his intensity increase, even over the phone.

"I remember one time when I was close, it did something like that to my friend. There it stood, smiling in a mockery of our facial expressions."

The moment passed, and his dialogue continued-

“Anyway, the bastards, the disciples, would kill, torture, whatever. I think when it rewired them, it removed whatever part of the brain controls empathy and replaced it with this sick enjoyment of seeing others in pain. Just seeing that bright pink was enough to put people into a panic.

"Natural disasters would wipe out whole towns, and the disciples forced its inhabitants to live in the ashes of what remained until exposure slowly killed them. Kids starved, watching commercials for soft drinks and candy, dying of malnutrition. It didn’t care if it made sense. The point was to make us feel helpless, mock our very society and humanity. To remind us that, even when we weren’t victims of its power, we were victims of our own failings. It wanted us to be ashamed of what we’d built—of who we were. Because, to it? We were nothing but cavemen. Less than that. We were cavemen staring up at a god.”

“You don’t need to tell me… but what happened to your friend?” I asked.

“It was Ken," he spoke with some effort, "My friend, my mentor. The one who got me into this whole mess.”

I noticed his voice cracked for the first time.

"The alien… it didn’t just end him. That would’ve been a mercy.

"We used to meet in this diner, every Wednesday. Same booth, same greasy food. Ken always liked routine. He’d sit there with his notes, coffee in hand, planning everything. One day, I was late. I walked in, saw him sitting in our spot, and he smiled at me—just like any other Wednesday."

His voice grew quieter, as if speaking any louder would make the memory too real.

"But the moment I sat down, everything changed. Ken… he was flung out of his seat. Like he was a rag doll pulled by an invisible noose. The entire diner went still, like time had stopped, and there he was, suspended in the air by nothing—just hanging there, helpless. His legs kicked, but he couldn’t move. The look in his eyes, him gasping for air, rapidly looking around… I’ll never forget it. When he was re-written.

“Ken was brilliant. Maybe the smartest of all of us. And that’s why it chose him. It knew he was the leader of our group, knew how much we depended on him. So it... chose him to be an example.

"He was different afterwards. It used him as a… puppet. For months. It used him to betray us in ways that weren’t even necessary—he’d leak locations of our members, sabotage our equipment, lead Every time we thought he was finally dead, he’d come back, doing things we couldn’t bear to watch. And it made him aware of every second of it. Imagine… being trapped inside your own body, watching yourself destroy everything and everyone you care about, helpless to stop it. That was Ken’s fate; it started using his mind against him”

He went silent for a long time, and I had no idea what to say. I knew he needed a break.

When I finally told him I had to up to leave, I awkwardly thanked him for his time. I told him I cared about him, and told him to stay safe. It was probably a weird thing to say, but he didn't appear to mind. Instead it seemed like that small bit of acknowledgment was something he hadn’t felt in a long time.
