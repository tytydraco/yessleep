I guess I’m gonna have to start using the computer more often. The Mailman told me he’d help me get things where they needed to go still, so I got this little computer set up in my hatch space. It’s called a ‘laptop’. I don’t see too many people carry them around, so I guess I’d forgotten about em’. I still feel like talkin’ might make things hold better as I get the words out, so I’m gonna use that uh. What’s the darn thing called. Speech to text. It’s easy to forget how many things got an other way round’.

I’m not sure how long it’s been for you. I’m not even sure anymore if you’re someone I should be relying on to be remembered. The moon’s a quarter in the sky, tonight. But I can’t bring myself to look at it. Who the hell knows what it’s light is gonna show me sittin’ in the shadows right outside my door.

Anyway. Trainee is sleeping. Just me right now. Been a real rough and tiring time. I’ve been a bit. Well. Antsy. About resuming. I’m not sure what’s safe anymore. What I’m sure about, though, is that I think being forgotten by folk is a tad more frightening than the other stuff on my mind. And I’m not just talking about myself.

I guess I should be startin’ with around when I woke up. I was sittin’ there, eating breakfast. Downing some milk, as I always do. The face on the carton that day is Ori’s. I wonder to myself if those shadow folk had put it up, or if it was security. Milkman himself had shown up. Think he’d maybe wanted to check on me, handed me a fresh crate full. He’d looked spiffy and proper as he always did, with his little egg yellow truck and his proper ghost white getup. Cow on the side that said ‘better moo’v on if you want to get things done!’

He lived by that motto, still. When his job took him, he embraced it. He changed in ways that were more behavioral than anything. He got more intense. When I talk to him, he’s always sayin’ things like ‘You know, Driver, they say people’s bones get brittle if they don’t get their calcium. There’s all sorts of places you can get that from. But a milk truck is the easiest place, so I’m gonna do my best to keep everyone havin’ strong bones.’

He’s the only milk truck left in the whole between, I think. I wonder if over the walls, if they got…

Right. So. I’m looking at the carton. I kind of start sortin’ through em’ all. There’s a lot more faces than usual on em’. I wonder real quick how many of them are going to be staying for a while, how many are going to suddenly get wiped off because they got brought home up against how many are gonna vanish because they’re dead and gone. I see a face that kind of tickles me wrong, but I don’t find any new passengers - people I’d driven before, I mean - on there.

When I play back my last recording, I hear my Trainee’s voice, and I get pretty grouchy for the day when it turns out that I did indeed blank on most of the mall trip. And in spite of things it’s, well, mostly fuzzy audio to me. Blurry nonsense, like if you put a record in a record player after scratching up the disk with a knife like it was your god given mission.

She tells me that it was a good trip. That she thought she’d heard and seen a few things. When she mentions the Policeman’s vehicle, I sigh and grumble about wonderin’ if there’d be trouble soon. That Lupe individual is sittin’ there in the bus already, waitin’. She’s already paid up after I’d talked with her the night before, all she says about goin’ places is ‘I’ll get off when I’m ready. If nothing happens for a couple stops, I’ll leave if you ask.’ Real particular about not going anywhere in particular, it’s nice.

I think she kept her people skin on because of the other two. It kind of felt odd, starting the day off with my bus crowded.

I make a few of the regular stops. Getting gas. Doing a couple trades, pickups and dropoffs of people and things. I notice near the end of the day’s runs, my Trainee getting a little antsy. She pricks up her good ear like she’d done outside the tunnel. When she stops and I see her relax, Lupe, she gets off. Says to give security a call if something comes up.

My last stop of the day was this motel. Squat little place with a strange energy about it. I don’t check in or nothin’. It seems a little. Seedy, honestly. There’s this moment when I’m standing in the lobby where this little wooden doodad or other passes me by, everything feels okay, then all my anxieties sink in so hard and fast I wipe off my glasses cause I’m thinkin’ the world looks dark and funny.

On the way out, I notice what looks like it could be the maintenance man staring hell and death into the back of my head through my rear view. The weather vane on top my bus spins for a second, like someone had flicked it, and then my mirrors gleam blinding and I almost swerve. I swear I felt all the roads drop away, all the ones that were special and all the ones that weren’t. I checked my rearview, saw the man in blue who’d been lookin’ at me so fierce frown before shutting the blinds.

“Hell was that about?” I mutter, and my Trainee is still looking behind us.

“The man we dropped off. In the gray suit. Do you remember him?”

“Huh?” I kinda furrow my brows, suck my teeth and wonder at a few things.

“Never mind.” And she leaves it at that. She doesn’t look ahead, though. I myself, I kind of switch my eyes between back and front, a few looks to the side here and there. I’m looking out for traps and whatnot, people who might need picking up. I catch a flash of black and white, red and blue here and there. See some of the Deers with their fat faces and their long necks loomin’ around trees, hear them clomping in the distance. They feel… Interested, to me.

It’s about an hour of driving, on my way to the Office to do some storage sortin’, maybe ask the Mailman a few things, that the environment changes in a way I don’t like.

A great lake rose out from nowhere to my side, right out the left driver side window. The patchwork world turned to something swampy and marshy, with a wet wound shining nothing but black under the moon’s eye. The trees became sparse and clustered, half-drowned. Despite the terrain shift the road just. Stretched away into the distance, snaking its own way through like it being there was nobody else’s business. I felt the ones not everyone else could see running into it like tributaries feeding a river.

It wasn’t the faint shining against the black water that drew my eye. It was the twinkle that brought my old eyes to a black-green helmet, bobbing in the water like a buoy. It was upside down, dark water sittin’ in it like an unboiled pot. There were a lot of other things, too. Old things. Suitcases. Dolls. Pieces of clothing that’d been soaked through so bad they were practically all ruined thread, like withered noodles in a soup that’d been left alone too long.

Something’s frilled spines were cutting through the water of the lake, dipping in and out. And the lake dominated so much of the horizon to my left and straight ahead that I wasn’t sure it really had an end. Everything does, but it’s really easy to forget when something just. Dominates a space.

I think I heard someone start casting a line, saw a figure somewhere along the lake’s shoreline, around the same time the Policeman’s siren started blaring behind me. I get this sour feeling in my gut. I kind of go quiet, trying to figure my way through the goings on and concoct a plan. I notice around then I’m hearing this. Burbling noise, right next to me. When I look down, I see that lil’ green creature we picked up pull one of the boxes at my feet down a little, wetting the cardboard a bit, and spit up something that looks like a hotel key into it. It landed in a growing pool of damp paper and something mucusy.

“When did he do that?” I keep my eyes switched between the rear view and the front. I still see scales, the Policeman is catching up a bit. I can’t quite remember in the moment if I’ve ever seen this particular bit of terrain before, if I’d felt the roads stretch and bend in that exact way.

“I think he went off for a moment. I thought he was following you. Exploring, maybe.” Trainee’s all hyper alert. I think of telling her to get down below, but I get this feeling that it would just be the worse spot to be in. I picture my bus flooding with water, water that was dark and black and carrying all the ghosts of the past.

“...Gosh darn it.” I smack the wheel and breathe hard. “Okay. Okay. Maybe I can…” I start thinking about going on those side roads. Not sure if it’s a sort of lure, but also I’m thinking it might go somewhere better regardless. I kind of try to feel them out, see if I can get a picture in my head of where I might end up.

The Policeman rams the side of my vehicle hard enough I smack my head on the driver side window. I swerve harder than I ever have before, almost go right into the lake. I hear reeds crunch, I think I hear a stubborn wheel push itself through some sucking mud as the bus tips harder righting itself. I realize I’d heard something shatter, and I notice only one of the front lights is on. A mist is coming up, a mist I’m not sure is natural, and things get foggy.

But I can still feel the road. The Policeman’s voice comes over my radio, cold and soulless. “Pull over. We’re already aware stolen property is on board. Resisting arrest will lead to harsher penalty.”

I have this mad moment where I’m not just frightened, but almost ashamed. Not noticing something so little getting me and my Trainee, and that little thing I’d started thinking of as a weird dog, into so much trouble. And I don’t know what that thing in the water is, but I’m thinking what if it gets Gxxx too? And I’m thinking of that one little word, and something is suddenly clicking, and I’m standing in front of a memorial.

I think of pulling over. I think I can talk it out. Then I remember seeing him drive off into the distance, on that one particular day. I think I remember something he said. Then I hear the hiss of something real large, see a great, long thing rising from the lake and dripping with waterfalls like it was shedding skin. I hear the rattling, tinkling and rustling of precious things. It gets cold. In my heart. In my hands, my grip on the wheel going all numb.

The road gets thinner. Rather, I should say, the roads. But only the ones I can see. I think to call security. And I go to do it. I pick up the talky, my hand shaking despite the lack of feelin’ in it. And I call a name, one that belonged to someone who did a pretty similar job back in the day. There’s always been security. Someone lookin’ out for folk, no matter where you go.

I see the Policeman go for another ram, then suddenly he swerves too. He slows down. Cruises. He keeps pace with me. He always has. But he’s not trying to catch up anymore. I start to see the way he’s driving change, get dialed back to all work, and I find a second word to go with the first I’d said. I can’t remember what it was anymore. But it was important.

“What’s happening? I want instructions!” I think my Trainee trusted me a lot, but I think the calm she was holding onto started fading a little when things got. Too normal. I heard her breathing hard and fast, swear I heard her heart thudding like a jackhammer. The thing in the water didn’t lean down to pull me into that black gleaming dark, and I didn’t hear any secrets from the moon. All I heard was the radio.

“Did you take care of her?” A little bit of the Policeman, the real one, creeps into the static.

“What?” I don’t know what he’s saying. Everything feels closed up, like I was developing claustrophobia mid-drive.

“Gxxxxx shepherd. Little bit of white on her nose. Always loved the water. I remember her paddling around. When things got. When they got different. I think I brought her back. I think someone else wanted her, had made her theirs. But I took her out of the pound and I turned her into a damn fine hound. So I wasn’t gonna just…”

I think it hurt him, the things he was sayin’. So he started driving again, in a way that’d been odd, then familiar, then suddenly odd again now. He asked me how a few people were doing, people who I think he wasn’t quite remembering all the way. His driving pattern zigzagged, while mine seemed to come back into focus.

I drove for a while. And I talked to him. And things started making sense again for me. He drifted away. “They took so much from us already. If I can’t have a dog, if I can’t have as little as that, what use is it still pretending the laws matter? Xxxxxxx is gone, xxxx. I’ll blare the siren and run down asshats for folk no matter if they look like me or like something from the-” I think he mentioned a book. “-But I’m not doing it alone.”

No. When was that? Never mind.

The lake never stopped running alongside us. The reeds, the gunky water. The bobbing bits in the black, none of it seemed like it’d ever end. I heard someone cast a line, and I thought I saw someone sitting on the shore. Around the same time I gave up, that I’d gotten real tired and I could see all the roads again for certain, it happened. I heard this sound like something dipping under the waves of the sea, and I smelled salt.

The serpent leaned down, and bared its needle teeth. I realized it’d been silly to think I could outpace it to begin with. I checked the rear view, and I noticed I couldn’t quite see where its frills ended, no matter how hard I squinted or adjusted my glasses. When I looked back, I felt foolish trying to send a prayer to a god I couldn’t quite remember, and wished I’d tried a little harder.

It didn’t open its maw to swallow me up. Instead, it took the Policeman. I don’t know what rule he’d broken, if any. Maybe we’d passed some sign, or something had snapped along the road. Maybe a piece of glass had shattered under tire, or a tiny wooden horse'd cracked in half. I saw a fully intact police cruiser slide along as barely an adam’s apple down the length of the monster’s throat, and it dipped into the water like nothing had ever happened. I think, maybe, for a second, it’d turned it’s black eyes on me.

The radio crackled. I heard the Policeman’s voice. “I think I’m going to retire somewhere warm. Sunny, with a wide shore. She loved the beach. She'd always shoot off, then come back all covered toe to nose in sand. Sometimes, she'd bring back shells.” I think I heard a laugh, but it could’ve just been a sob or gurgle. I heard a wet squelch, something that sounded like a groan or a hiss, or both, and then the sound of glass and steel bending under pressure. There was a sizzling noise. It got loud enough it fizzled the radio into an ear bleeding sound that made my teeth clench, and I heard my Trainee thump.

Everything turned to serene, quiet forest. I pulled over, went off the road and forgot all my rules personal and otherwise for a second. The little green thing got off the bus, and the hotel key was gone. In its place was a single spent bullet casing. I’m not sure if it was meant to be payment for the ride, or for something else. Over the radio I heard something whisper. If the world hadn't been so still, not sure I would've heard it.

"Greenhorn. Four-Eleven." They sounded ragged. Choked. I think, maybe, there might've been the sound of a door clicking open. "I need assistance at F-" Something rang out. I think it would've been a startling sound if it'd been louder. There was a thud.

I opened the package. Brought up the old sodden thing from the underspace. The deer watched with big eyes, and one wandered towards the bus to sniff my lights. It snorted and scrunched its face up when it saw one was broken. When I unraveled the string, there was a wrapped up dog collar inside. On the tag, it said *Lupe*.

I went to Fish. I asked someone if they had graves around there, and they looked at me real funny like. When I repeated myself, they pointed me somewhere. Something felt like it was calling to me, some secret I really needed to remember. Near a particular house down by the docks, there was a big dog with black and brown fur resting on her belly next to a house that had too many holes in it. She had white around her muzzle, and I looked at her thinking I was mighty puzzled how she was still around.

I went to the graveyard that was a block or two over. There, the dead finally were allowed to have their names displayed in full. Only it no longer mattered. And I realized I didn't know what names I was supposed to be looking for anyways. So I just went back to that house and its guardian. She was patient with me, as she always was with everyone. It'd made her very good at her job.

I snapped the collar around her neck, like it was the only motion I could’ve ever chosen to make next, and she got up and left. I think she went towards the forest. I went towards the Office. I talked with the Mailman about a couple of things, and when I sorted out what needed sorting out - well, the practical things, at least - I got the lappy from him. I think it was because I told him somewhere during that conversation - why he'd given it to me, that is - that I’d started feeling a little scared of my own voice.

When I turned back to Fish, I spent a couple days driving around that area in particular. Resumed with my Trainee, the teachin’ that is. I think I expected something to happen. Maybe see a long row of frilled spines or needled teeth peeking at me from the lake. Maybe I’d see the dog come back, I don’t know. Or the kid with his photos. But nobody showed up, or did anything wild, except security poppin' in for a bit to have a look at things. I hadn't called them. I didn’t see that one fisherman either. I didn’t see the suiter, and I had this strange feeling like someone local was missing them very much.

 I went back to the bus to check things out after watching the sun go down and giving up my objectiveless vigil. Double, triple checked everything was working as it should be, that nothing had been taken that I’d be mightily displeased if I didn’t know where it was anymore or who had it. Made sure nothing wet was in the boxes that didn’t belong, or had been put there without my asking.

‘Upstairs’ - I suppose uphatch? I don’t know, in the bus - in the back, there’s a little fellow sitting there. When I got on board, they were just... There. I don’t usually take kindly to people getting on before I let them on, but I guess either I left the door open like a fool or, well. They let themselves in. I lean more towards the latter idea.

As long as someone puts somethin’ in the box and does the checks once they’re on, it’s not much trouble in the end. As long as they don’t go down into the hatch and breach my privacy. That’s kind of where the problem was.

They were holding some of the paper slips. Their head, it looks like a flashlight. Maybe a spotlight. Got a little yellow raincoat on, but no hat. I let em’ borrow one of mine. They looked me in the eye. And they had little hands like they were made of wires. Feet like three little points, like the sort of thing you’d make to stand up a tripod.

I called em’ friend, and it felt natural. They said it back. And when I asked em’ where they wanted to be goin’, they said ‘take me to the walls’. They didn’t seem to care which ones. I don’t know why. But I feel like I’ve done something really wrong. And I’m hurting a lot. My Trainee’s got my hand in hers as I’m speakin’ this out. I see the words crawling across the screen, and I feel sick as like I drank a whole jug of rotten milk.

There are a lot of extra slips now. Lot of em’ have pictures. Dark tunnels, lightbulbs. And a figure who feels real familiar, shinin’ their light through the blackness. They’ve got a… Speech bubble next to their head, but it’s got no words in it. The rest, I think. The ones that do have words. Every single one of em’ is familiar, but I don’t think anyone I know wrote a single damn one.

I’m sorry, Jxx. Mxxx. Gxxx. Wxxx. Why did I have to be the one who didn’t change? Wish you could’ve kept drivin’. Patrollin’. Deliverin’ and writin’ in a world that made sense. There’s others out there, too, I’ve just…
