“Where are you going?”

Brady was unbuckling his seatbelt. "Obviously, the guy in there did something to the photos. I’m going to give him a piece of my mind.” He started to swing the door open—

“Wait!” Casey shouted.

“What?”

“What if he’s out there?”

“Who?” Brady asked.

“Craig. My… my neighbor.”

“Why would he be at the CVS?”

“I don’t know. But, it’s only 3 miles from his house, so he could be here.”

“Wait, guys, this doesn’t make sense. How would the photo guy *know* we thought the camera took our last photos before we died?” Maribel asked, placing her own photo in the cupholder.

“Because we were talking about it,” I replied. “At least, Casey and I were. We were trying to be quiet, but it’s possible he heard us.”

A heavy silence fell over us. “Okay, let’s go,” Maribel said, opening her door.

The night was unusually dark. The sliver of a moon hung in the black sky, far above the streetlamps of the parking lot. We made our way towards the sliding doors, glowing warm yellow.

Brady was probably right. The photo guy certainly had the time—we were in the store for a full hour, waiting for the photos to be developed. He could’ve easily hopped on some AI tool like Midjourney and typed in things like *old man standing on the beach* or *Christmas family photo of old woman.*

Although, it would take some photoshopping skills to get our actual faces in the images. But if he had access to the real photos we took, that was possible.

“Nobody recognized the photo guy, right?” I whispered, right before we stepped inside.

“No,” Brady replied. Maribel and Casey shook heads.

I hadn’t recognized him, either, but he looked like he was only a few years older than us. It was possible he knew one of us. Maybe he even had some sort of revenge plot. Maybe his brother had a crush on Casey, or maybe Maribel got picked for the trivia team over his little sister. Just because we didn’t know him… didn’t mean he didn’t know *us.*

Six degrees of separation. Much less than that, in a small town like ours.

We stepped into the CVS. There was an old woman at the cash register, but no one at the photo booth. “Hey, where’d he go? The photo guy?” Brady called out to her, somewhat aggressively.

“He’s in the back, I think,” she replied, eyeing him warily.

We wandered through the aisles. “He’s hiding,” Brady whispered to us. “He knows what he did and he’s hiding out.”

We followed him down the aisle, the fluorescent lights blinking above us. The more empty aisles we passed, the more convinced I became of this theory. He’d messed with the photos and slipped out before we could confront him about it.

Except, that left all sorts of questions, like:

*How did he know what Casey’s neighbor’s basement looked like?*

*Wouldn’t an AI tool refuse to generate such a disturbing image, of a woman tied up in a basement?*

We turned the corner—and there he was. The photo guy, restocking in the cold medicine aisle.

And then it happened.

Brady went batshit on him. “Hey! *HEY!* That wasn’t fucking funny, what you did to the photos!”

Photo Guy whipped around. His eyes widened and he held up his hands. “Woah, woah,” he said, taking a step back. “What are you—”

“Stop,” Casey said, stepping in front of Brady. Then she turned to Photo Guy. “Did you do something to the photos?” Her tone had an edge to it I’d never heard in it before. Fear and anger slicing through her usual bubbly, chatty tone.

And then, to my shock—

Photo Guy nodded.

All of us froze. For a second, time seemed to stop. Then Brady started up again. “You’re a sicko. That was a horrible thing to do—photoshopping Casey, making it look like she was tied up in a basement—”

“Wait, what?” Photo Guy asked, his eyes widening.

“Oh, don’t deny it,” Casey spat. “Brady’s right, what you did was sick. You’re a fucking psycho.”

“*Nonono*—I did *not* do that.” He shook his head wildly. “Look, all I was saying is that I messed up your photo job. Okay? Earlier today I spilled some coke on the machine, and when your photos came out, they were all warped and weird and stuff. That happens if water gets inside the machine. And I already threw out the negatives, so I couldn’t reprint them. That’s all.” He held up his hands in surrender.

“So you didn’t edit a photo to show Casey,” I said, gesturing to her, “tied up in a basement?”

His expression told me the answer. “No.”

“Wait… *all* the photos were messed up?” I asked.

“Yeah, I think so.”

“We didn’t get any photos that were messed up. Right?” I turned to Casey. She shook her head.

Photo Guy shrugged. “I don’t know, guys. I’m just telling you what happened.”

“Was there anything wrong with the camera? Like a Raspberry Pi inside it or anything?” Maribel asked.

“A… raspberry pie?” His face scrunched up as he glanced between us.

“Like, a microchip. A computer. Anything.”

He shook his head. “It looked just like a normal disposable camera to me. Although I haven’t seen one of those in years.”

An awkward silence fell on the five of us. “Thanks, sorry for bothering you,” Maribel said finally, starting back down the aisle. The three of us followed her towards the front of the store.

We got back to the car without a word. Brady and Maribel in the front, Casey and I in the back. I stared at the dark parking lot ahead, my heart pounding in my ears. Maribel fidgeted with her photo in the cupholder. Brady dug in his pocket for the keys. Casey kept her back to me, staring out her window.

The car rumbled to life underneath us.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“My house,” Brady replied. “My mom won’t care. You and Casey can take the spare room and Maribel can be on the pull-out sofa.”

I glanced at Casey. She didn’t turn around.

“Fine with me,” Maribel replied.

Brady started pulling out of the parking space.

“Wait!” Casey said, suddenly.

The three of us turned to her.

“We should take a photo of Benny. Then that isn’t his last photo alive, and the camera is wrong.”

Brady let out a laugh. “You’re saying you actually believe this shit?”

She scrunched her face at him. “Come on, let’s just do it, okay?”

“Fine with me,” I replied.

Casey turned to me, holding her phone up. I stared at the black camera glinting in the light, staring at me. She raised her hand, her finger shaking over the screen. “Okay, 3… 2… 1…”

*Click.*

The fake shutter-sound filled the car.

But as she stared at the phone screen, her eyes widened. “Wait... what?” she whispered.

My heart dropped.

“The camera app just, like, quit out. Hang on…”

She tapped at the screen. *Click.* Her eyebrows furrowed.

“It quit out again.”

“Let me try.” Maribel pulled out her phone and pointed it at me.

*Click.*

Her smile dropped. She glanced at her phone, then back at me. “Mine just did the same thing,” she said. “It just quit out… as soon as I took the picture.”

“That’s ‘cause both of you have crappy iPhone 10s or whatever,” Brady said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone—one of the sleek, new Motorola phones that folded up. He lifted it and pointed it at me.

The bright white of a flash filled the car.

As my eyes readjusted to the darkness, I saw Brady’s face. His eyes were wide as he stared at the screen. “No, that doesn’t even make sense,” he muttered to himself, tapping at the screen.

“What?” I asked.

He slowly turned the phone around so I could see.

All the blood drained out of my face.

The photo simply showed the empty backseat of the car. Where I should’ve been sitting—it was just empty.

“What does that mean? I’m like a ghost?” I said, with a forced laugh. But inside, my heart was pounding like a jackrabbit’s, thrumming inside my ears.

“Let’s get out of here.” Brady threw the car in reverse. He backed out of the parking space and sped towards the exit. We flew down the main road through town, passing the little shops lined up, the tea place, the bagel shop.

In the darkness, I felt a hand curl around mine.

I tore my eyes away from the window and found Casey staring at me. Her hand was tight around mine, ice-cold.

Guilt stabbed through me. I slowly pulled my hand away.

“What?”

I couldn’t break up with her here in the car. Right now. Could I? I shoved my hands in my pockets. “Sorry. My hands are really cold.”

“I’ll warm them up.”

“No, your hands are cold too. Colder than mine, actually.”

Maribel turned around. “What’s up?”

Casey glared at me. Then she turned to Maribel. “Nothing,” she muttered. Then she crossed her arms and stared out the window, not even glancing in my direction for the entire rest of the drive.

Ten minutes later we were pulling into Brady’s driveway. He shut off the car and the inside lights came on. I squinted in the sudden brightness. Casey was motionless, like a statue, still sulking and staring out the window.

Maribel’s voice broke the silence.

“Oh, my God.”

She’d grabbed her photo out of the cupholder and was holding it close to her face. It fluttered and shook in her hands.

My heart plummeted.

Without a word, she turned it around for all of us to see.

It took me a minute to notice the change. Because the photo looked the same: an ancient old lady sitting in front of a Christmas tree, surrounded by family. But now… now, the woman who had been holding the baby… she was different.

In the previous photo, she’d been holding a little girl in an elaborate infant Christmas dress.

Now, she was holding a little boy, dressed in a teeny little suit.

“It… it changed,” she whispered.

“Mine changed too,” Brady said. “But—not by much. It’s just me a little older.”

Casey scrambled for her photo—and I heard her sigh of relief almost instantly. She held it out to me, shoving it in my face, before I could even look at mine. “We did it,” she said, her voice wavering. “Look.”

Her photo no longer showed her tied up in a basement. Instead, it was a woman with wild gray hair in her 60s, posing next to a shaggy black dog.

Relief flooded me.

But that relief evaporated as soon as I looked at my photo again.

It wasn’t the same photo of me posing against the tree. It was a different photo—a *wedding* photo.

I was dressed in a tux. Beaming with joy, grinning ear-to-ear. Hair slicked back and bowtie crisp black against my neck. Hand-in-hand with a beautiful bride.

A bride I recognized.

*It was Maribel.*

I tried to hide it, but it was too late. Casey’s eyes widened. Brady and Maribel leaned into the backseat, curious. Maribel’s mouth fell open. Brady stared in shock.

The photo swam before me, as I felt weak, as darkness crept into the edges of my [vision.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
