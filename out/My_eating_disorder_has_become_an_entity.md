"You're disgusting, you've put on five pounds in 3 weeks! Are you trying to get a muffin top before the photoshoot next week? Do you hate me or something?!"

I looked down at my body, which couldn't have weighed more than a hundred pounds, then back at my mother.

"No mom."

"Well you're sure acting like it, if you can't control your eating impulses by yourself, you're going to go back on the pills."

*Oh god not the pills.* I thought back to when my mother entered me into beauty pageants as a kid, my diet was barley more then chicken noodle soup and Ritalin.

My mother is my modeling agent, and I suspect that after she dies, she will fill out a role in hells offices nicely. Probably in a cubicle next to gengas Kahn, Hitler, and Colonel Sanders.

"I can lose the weight by the show day"

"Well, i'll be doing random weight checks on you, if you're not down on the pounds soon, I'll be taking matters into my own hands." My mother said, slamming my bedroom door behind her.

I was pissed off, and tired of living out my mothers dreams. I didn't even want to be a model in the first place, but she wouldn't hear me out. I decided to do something that I knew would make me feel better, no matter how fleeting the feeling was.

I called a cab and headed to a local motel that took cash and aliases. Maybe I was being overly cautious, but I could imagine my mother busting the motel door down like a SWAT team if she caught wind of what I was up to.

I settled in to my room, and downloaded a few food delivery apps on my phone. Burgers, Chinese food, fried chicken. I couldn't control myself, it had been weeks since I'd had a full meal. When the food arrived, I sat cross legged on the floor and arranged the various containers in front of myself, then began gorging like a starved animal.

When I was done I could barely move, I waddled to the bathroom to purge the food from my body. I jammed two fingers down my throat and began dry heaving into the porcelain bowl. Eventually things began to flow and I was feeling a bit better, like I finally had some control again. I went to flush, but made the mistake of looking down.

The bile in toilet was bubbling and jumping around like hot magma, I leaned forward to get a better look and before I could comprehend what was happening, an arm of puke reached up and grabbed my throat. I screamed as it tried to pull my head down towards the frothing bowl of stomach acid and sick. I groped around for the handle and flushed the toilet, I felt the fingers burning into my neck slowly losing their grip, then the arm was ripped down the pipes, freeing me from whatever the fuck that thing was.

I got up and looked in the mirror, to my horror I saw a sizzling hand print burned into my neck, I tried to touch it and yelped, it felt like a second degree burn. I showered and tried to dress the wound as best I could, and went back home.

I wore scarfs and oversized hoodies the next week, when questioned about it by my mother, I just told her I was cold. I wasn't binging anymore, but I was definitely stress eating. Then it finally happened.

"Get on the scale."

My mother appeared at my doorway like the ghost of Christmas eating disorders.

"No." I said, watching her eyes grow wide.

"What the fuck did you just say to me? How dare you!" She screamed, grabbing me by my neck and forcing me to the bathroom. She slammed my head to the wall and I was seeing stars.

*Get-on-thefuckinscale* she huffed out from behind gritted teeth as she tried to wrestle me to the scale. Dizzy and weak, I relented and got on.

"Are you kidding me?..." my mothers words terrified me and I looked down at the scale. 

*115 pounds*.

My mother slammed my face into the wall again and began dragging me towards the toilet. 

*YOU FAT FUCKIN PIG, YOU RUINED MY BODY WHEN I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS WORLD AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?!* 

my mother screamed into my ear as she tried to jam her fingers down my throat. Gagging and heaving, I tried to pull her arm away but I was too weak, I gave up and vomit began pouring into the toilet.

Exhausted and breathing hard, I began to cry.

"Clean yourself up" my mother snarled at me. I was about to flush when I saw the contents of the bowl quivering and shaking like jello in an earthquake, then an arm reached out and gripped the lip of the bowl. I skittered back like a scared crab as another arm reached out, gripping the other side of the bowl and a shapeless mass began pulling itself out.

My mother was frozen on the spot, staring slack jawed at the thing oozing towards her. It opened its arms and pulled her into a bear hug and I heard a muffled gurgling like somebody trying to scream underwater. I could see her flesh melting off of her body in steaming chunks and her intestines began seeping out onto the floor. I ran out of the bathroom, slamming and locking the door behind me, I doubted it would hold it for long but it was all I could do.

I'm back at the motel writing this. I don't know what to do but I'm afraid of calling the police, I don't even know how I would explain all of this to them. I'll update this post if anything changes but I'm going to have to keep moving around.
