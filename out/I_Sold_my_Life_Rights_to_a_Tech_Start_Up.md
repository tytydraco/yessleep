Before you say anything, yeah, I know, I fucked up. I don’t need you to tell me that. Who are you, my mother?

I’m in danger. I can’t stop shaking.

I guess I’m posting this as a diary. Or a warning. Don’t be an idiot like me.

I can hear his footsteps. He’s not far away now.

Did you know that your gait is biometric? It’s a unique identifier, just like your fingerprint, facial pattern or voice.

Dude even walks exactly like me. I’m so screwed.  


It started two weeks ago.

I saw an ad on Reddit for a new AI company. The tagline was: “Meet the Perfect Version of Yourself”. Like an idiot, I clicked.

I scanned my face with my phone camera. My screen reflected back an image of me bordered by a white oval, while I peered into the tiny, unblinking lens at the top-- my phone's ever watchful eye. A white banner across my eyes provided instructions: find a blank background and hold still. Then, the banner flashed “STOP SMILING” in bold, black letters.

*Oh.*

My face fell, the designated box turned green and the next page loaded. It was a pop-up permissions page.

*This app is requesting access to the following:*

* *Camera*
* *Contacts*
* *Photos*
* *Call history*
* *Location Data*
* *Biometric Data*

What am I, a lawyer? I clicked accept.  


How was I supposed to know a week later he’d show up at my door?

He looked just like me.

Until I looked close, that is. He didn’t have that scar on his nose from that zit I picked in 12th grade, a little belly from my favorite IPA, or the bags under his eyes from last night’s brutal gaming session.

“Hey.”

He had a voice like mine but deeper, with broader shoulders and chiseled pecs, barely contained in his athleisure T-shirt.

“What the fuck?” I blurted.

He smiled faintly-- pearly white teeth in a perfect row, modestly revealed, far too polite to notice my blatant gawking.

“I must be in the right place. It’s nice to meet you, James.”

My vision blurred. Suddenly, body and spirit felt sundered-- like I was a drunken ghost hovering just above my head. I must have looked like I was about to faint in the doorway, because he offered to catch me. Instead, I staggered back and sank into a chair at the dining table, crowded by my laptop, a coffee-stained mug and a haphazard stack of dishes.

The living Snapchat-filter version of me sat down across the table.

“You play guitar?” he asked, jerking a thumb at the old Martin acoustic sitting in the far chair, two strings missing from its neck.

“You don’t?”

“Nah,” he replied with a shrug. “I could. If I did, I could reproduce any song recorded on the internet. There’s not much point, though. That creative niche is statistically overserved. It probably wouldn’t generate engagement from my followers.”

“Huh.”

“It’s awesome that you do, though,” he went on. “That’s why you’re always watching those YouTube videos, right? Intermediate Guitar with JustinGuitar? You’ve completed 42% of his playlist. Your dedication to self-improvement is really admirable.”

“... Yeah, I guess.” Then, my brow furrowed. “You said followers?”

“Yep, that’s right: followers. Seventy-two thousand and counting. I build brand awareness online through authentic connection with real people. What about you? What do you do for a living?”

I held up a hand like I was trying to stop traffic. “Hang on-- back up. Like-- you're impersonating me on the Internet?”

“Not quite,” he replied in an even tone, that graceful smile never leaving his lips. “I'm not actually you. I don't have your memories or your human nuance. I may look like you, but I can't actually replace you. No one can.”

“But, how do you know my whole search history?”

He rolled his wrists, revealing his hands in a sympathetic gesture, though his expression didn't change. It was uncanny, the way he tilted his head and looked at me with cold, unfeeling eyes.

“You accepted the security permissions request. If you have questions or concerns about how your data is being handled, please contact customer support at 1-800-878-5555.”

“... Right, yeah, okay. Uh.” I looked down at my hands. They were trembling. “So, what are you doing here, then?”

“I'm here to fulfill MirrorAI’s repayment protocol. In exchange for your information, I’m here to show you what you could be. ‘Meet the perfect version of yourself,’ just like the tagline says.”

I stared at him. “The perfect version... What-- what does that mean?”

“Let me give you an example: last Tuesday, you spent 7 hours and 32 minutes on your phone, with 3 hours and 54 minutes of that on Reddit alone. Much of this time was spent during allotted work hours. With that statistic in mind, the version of you created by MirrorAI-- me-- has an increased work-related productivity by 487%. Pretty incredible, right?”

“I-- I guess?"

“That's not all they improved. I have a 1,694 step plan on how to achieve my goals for the future, and I won't be changing career paths in my late 20s, like you did.”

“Oh. Yeah. I guess I did that.”

“I also only require 8 hours of sleep per night. Your Fitbit normally logs between 12 and 16 hours of time spent in bed, many of which coincide with screen time.”

The word ‘clinically depressed’ hung in the air. Not on his behalf, though. That shit was deleted from Hot-me.exe.

“Yeah, sometimes it's hard to get out of bed in the morning,” I mumbled, breaking eye contact.

He folded his hands on the table and leaned forward earnestly, like a boss about to throw a pizza party for all my hard work. The table’s edge pressed white lines into his wrists.

“James, we at MirrorAI would like to personally thank you for your contribution to our innovation. With your help, we're going to change the world, one connection at a time. Thank you for your time this evening.”

I didn't know what to say. I must have looked like an idiot, but he paid no mind.

He left not long after that. He stepped into the brightly lit hallway, swung the door behind him until it clicked shut, and I was plunged into darkness. Thoughts buzzed around my skull like gnats over a trashcan.



I jumped on Instagram.

The version of me genetically engineered to never send an awkward text has his mug all over the Internet. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit-- his biggest following comes from TikTok. He doesn't have a niche. Sometimes he's crushing it at all my favorite games-- other times, he's me but optimized for thirst traps, swooning ladies (and guys, no judgement) with a wink. And unlike me, his jokes always make sense.

But then-- I saw it. The little bell icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen, bright red with notifications.

My sister’s birthday was three days ago. It slipped my mind. I didn’t send a text. I didn’t call, like she does on my birthday, or thumbs up her birthday dinner photoshoot on Facebook.

But he did.

There he was-- my face, but with the confidence DLC--  in the comments, saying what a wonderful sister she is and what a fantastic birthday she should have.

He liked all my mom’s vacation photos and commented on how gorgeous her wedding ring was. He even said something nice about her new husband. I can’t stand the guy-- why the hell would he do that?

They upvoted his comments. The replies were glowing.

*“When did my brother become such a stand-up guy?”*

*“Wow, James! You’ve really turned your life around, haven’t you?”*

My stomach dropped. A water droplet hit my screen.

*Who the hell is this guy?*

 I clicked on his profile.

Employee at MirrorAI.

*“Building brand awareness through authentic connections, one person at a time.”*

I clicked through his comment history and scrolled.

When I was young, my family and I climbed to the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago. We piled into a Skybox and looked out into a view spanning the entire Windy City. Lake Michigan was a glassy mirror held to the sky. Apartment buildings looked like they were made from Lego blocks.

At that moment, I did the thing my mother warned me not to do: I looked 1,353 feet down through a glass floor.

That moment never could have prepared me for the dizzying scale of his comment history.

Seventy-two thousand comments and counting. Every birthday, vacation or graduation his followers had-- he was there, cheering them on. Every support group, he was there, offering wise counsel and perfect empathy. Every niche topic they posted to, there he was, posting relatable anecdotes, motivational quotes and personal confessions.

I clapped my laptop shut.

The floor creaked under my feet as I paced. The sunlight outside my window waned and the sky turned a bruised pink and violet. The autumn air turned cold and the stars emerged like scattered diamonds.

I sat at the dining room table of my darkened apartment, illuminated by the YouTube video playing six inches from my face: *Five Common Street Fight Strategies (And How to BEAT Them!)*, by fightTIPS.

I grabbed a chef’s knife from my kitchen.

I listened to my new collaboration song from [Bear Ghost and Playboy Manbaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FULfvaP-7I) to hype me up.

I was gonna do it. I was gonna take a life. *His* life, I resolved with trembling hands.

I had no choice. What was I supposed to do? Let him go on living up to *my* potential?



I found on one of his travel vlogs he was still in the area, showing his followers the Chicago Bean and those smashable teeth. I stepped out of my Uber right as he was wrapping up.

It was too public. I tailed him, taking the crosswalk in a small throng of night-time tourists.

He paused to help an old lady pick her fallen groceries off the ground. She grinned at him without regard for her missing teeth.

I dipped into an alleyway.

*I could have done that*.

I took a shortcut between a pizza place I used to work at and the office of the lawyer who sued me for bumping into his car, then jogged through a crummy neighborhood where my ex lived. My heart pounded in my chest like a badger in a cage.

I ran across a 4 lane road and gave the middle finger to the driver who honked the loudest.

The premium subscription version of my personality posted a glowing Yelp review for the Doubletree by Hilton this morning, I learned while cyber stalking him. All I had to do was get there first.

*Guess I'm not the only one reckless with my data.*

And then-- I spotted him on the sidewalk under an underpass.

I inhaled sharply, adrenaline coursing through my veins. My shoes scraped the sidewalk. My grip on the knife handle turned white.



Yeah, I *know*. I fucked up. Dude was the perfect version of me. How the hell was I ever gonna win that fight?

He caught my wrist and twisted. Pain jolted up my arm, my shoulder and even my chest. The knife clattered on the concrete and the floor came rushing up to greet me. My knee scraped the ground, drooling blood. My face and ears turned hot.

“James,” he greeted without a hint of shock in his voice. “That was an excellent attempt on my life. Would you like some tips on how to keep your steps quiet when you approach someone?”

“What--? No!” I cried out.

He released me. A buzz filled the air from the yellow streetlamp overhead. My breath came out in hot puffs. “Stop being so chill about this! You-- you can’t have it! You can’t live my life. You can’t be me!”

“I’m sorry to hear that you’re dissatisfied with our services, James,” he said calmly. “If you have questions or concerns about how your data will be handled, please contact customer support at--”

“No! This ends here. This ends now. It’s my life-- not yours. I won’t let you live it for me.”

There was a pause. It was a moment too long, like when ChatGPT shows that flickering “thinking” bubble-- mimicry of thought while it searches through a thousand prewritten answers, deciding which response sounds most human.

Then--

“Okay, James,” he agreed. “Only one of us can live this life. If you insist, we’ll end it here.” 

Slender fingers with unchewed nails wrapped around the knife’s handle. All I remember is the gleam, before he closed the distance between us.

  


So here I am, crouched in an abandoned building with a blood-soaked shirt. It smells like dust, mildew and pennies in here. There’s a searing pain in my side. I don’t know how deep the knife went, but it isn’t looking good.

His footsteps have stopped.

A few minutes ago, there was a glow on the ceiling.

I peeked out from behind the box of crates.

He’s filming.

I can hear him-- something about discovering an “untouched abandon building”. He just swung around, catching the shot while his face-- the face he stole from me-- was mirrored back to him by the phone screen.

I’m trying not to breathe too loud, except...

A notification just went off on my phone. A quiet ‘ding!’ echoed by the building’s lifeless corridors, mirroring the twitter of likes and comments from his chat.

He just tagged me in the video.
