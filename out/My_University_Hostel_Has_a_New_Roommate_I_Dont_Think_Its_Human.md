I’m a student at the University of Cape Coast in Ghana. I stay in one of the student halls on campus. It’s basically a shared hostel. Four of us sleep in one room.

If you’ve ever lived in a place like that, you know it’s never quiet. There’s always noise, people shouting, music playing, or someone dragging their chair across the floor at 1 a.m. You learn to live with it.

I sleep on the top bunk of a metal bed. The girl who sleeps below me is always out like a light. The fan barely works, and the beds are old. They creak if you move the wrong way. But I adjusted.

At least, I thought I did.

One night, I started hearing a strange creaking sound.

At first, I assumed it was the bed. But this creak was… different. Slower. Steadier. It would start around 2 or 3 in the morning.
Eee—eee—eee.

Like something rocking back and forth.

The first few times, I tried to ignore it. But it kept coming back. Every night. And every night, it got louder.

What made it worse was that I couldn’t figure out where the sound was coming from. Sometimes it felt like it was under the bed. Other times near the locker. Sometimes right beside me. But the moment I moved, it stopped.

I started lying still for long periods, holding my breath, just listening.
Eee—eee—eee.

It made my skin crawl.

One morning, I asked the girl on the bottom bunk if she’d heard anything during the night.

She looked confused. “No. I sleep like a log. Why?”

I told her about the creaking. She laughed and said, “Maybe it’s just the old bed. Or maybe…” she smirked, “...you’ve got an extra roommate.”

It was a joke. But the way she said it,.her eyes didn’t quite match her smile. Like she didn’t fully believe it was a joke.

I laughed along. But that night, I started sleeping with my phone under my pillow.

A few days later, the sound came back.
Eee—eee—eee.

I sat up quietly and leaned over the edge of my bunk. The others were asleep. Everything looked normal.

There’s a lot of space under the bottom bunk. My bunk has nothing underneath, but hers does. It’s always dark under there. I don’t even know why I decided to check. I just needed to know.

I grabbed my phone and pointed the flashlight down.

Before I even turned the light on
something moved.

A shadow. Fast and low. It darted across the floor under her bed.

I jerked back so quickly I hit my head on the metal frame. My heart was pounding. I didn’t say anything. I just lay back and stared at the ceiling.

The creaking stopped.

The next day, I told the other girls.

They laughed, of course. One of them said, “Ei, we've got a ghost in our room now?”

We all laughed. Even me. I didn’t want to seem paranoid.

But something about laughing at it… inviting it in like that… felt wrong.

Because that’s when everything changed.

It started showing itself.

Not clearly. Just little things. Quick glances. Movements you second-guess.

One night, I was half-asleep when I saw a figure walking across the room. From the bathroom door to the window. I thought maybe someone had woken up to pee. But when I turned my head all three girls were in bed.

Then it turned to face me.

That was the first time I experienced sleep paralysis. My eyes were open. I could see. I could breathe. But I couldn’t move. Not even a finger.

It stood at the foot of my bed. I couldn’t see its face, but I knew it was watching me.

Then it ran at me.

It didn’t walk. It charged. And right before it reached me, I woke up gasping, like someone had slammed their hand into my chest.

After that, it kept coming.

Sometimes, it sits at the edge of the bed. Sometimes it’s right on top of me. I feel the pressure. The cold. The weight. I try to scream, but nothing comes out.

Other times, I wake up and see it perched on the bottom bunk. Its knees pulled to its chest. Its arms long and bent the wrong way. Just staring at me.

And it always knows when I’m awake.

And when it does, it run towards me.

Every time.

What scares me the most is that it’s always the same.

Same shape. Same height. Same way of moving. People say sleep paralysis shows you random things. But this one isn’t random. It’s the same every time.

Now I see it during the day. When I nap. When I blink too long. Once, I saw it in the tap’s reflection in the shared bathroom.

I don’t know what it wants.

But I know it got stronger when I started noticing it.

And now, my roommate says she hears the creaking too.

She doesn’t laugh anymore.

We sleep with the light on.

But I don’t think that helps.

Last night, I saw it crouching beside her bed. It turned its head slowly tiwards me.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even blink.

But I swear

I felt it crawl back under her bed.

And I don’t think it’s leaving.
