This is Important, I need to tell you about this. I am watching the vhs tape of the broadcast now as I write this.

 Have you heard about the Tamara broadcast? If not, then in 1985, a creepy broadcast of CNN was aired, it started out like normal, but after the final commercial, a photo of a missing girl (Tamara) was shown, with text that read “missing. Last seen 6/12/1985.” 

 Nobody knows anything tamara , If she’s even real, if she’s alive or dead. Not even 38 years later. This happened twice, again showing the same missing poster in 1990. 

My experience watching the broadcast I’m about to talk about, eerily relates to Tamara. This happened when I was 14, and I had this liking in recording a broadcast each week, and I recorded this said broadcast. Strangely enough I was watching said broadcast in the dark (This is important info). 

I still remember all it, the music, the sounds, the images, and most of all the commercials. 


On the 6th of april 1997, at 10pm, on a commercial break of the most recent Saturday night live episode 4 commercials played. 

Ad 1. An advert of a bleach and latex gloves bundle. A cheery man said “get bleach snd latex gloves in a super clean bundle, for only $4.99! And if you spend an extra 20¢, you can get a extra set for FREE! A crowd then cheered and them the commercial ended.

 Advert 2. A cassette tape player/recorder demo, Culture Club’s song Karma chameleon started playing, and it sounded warped, like a song thats slightly out of tune, it played for the whole song until it ended, and a person took the tape out. White, bold text with a black outline faded into view, reading JcPenney cassette recorder, only $29.99. Then the screen faded to black. 

Advert 3. A silverline hobby knife set faded into view, only ambient noises were heard as a robotic voice read: “hobby knife set, do whatever needs to be done. It then cut to a montage showing what the voicce was saying Cut wood, slash a tyre, pry a hinge off a door, cut your own f- *new voice* “Silverline hobby knife set, only $17.45.”

Final advert. A Waterproof poncho glitched into view, spinning on a giant rotating model stand. What sounded Relaxing intercom music played as the poncho spin, colourful text spun into view. The text read “Anti-wet waterproof poncho” as a woman read in a soft, soothing voice. “With our Anti-Soak technology, you will sure to never get wet during sticky situations again. Survive the rain, be immune to getting paint or bleach poured on you. Only 2$ for a pair. 

Then the video glitched for a few minutes, and when it stopped, there was something that looked like a pitch black room. 

This is where it got disturbing, and made me bolt out of the room.

The video cut to a young girl wearing a poncho for some reason , looking into the camera and started speaking “Hi, my name is TamTam and Today, I am going to be listening to some music! And she did, she put in a cassette tape. The Same song from Ad 2 played. 

 At that moment, a masked person appeared. But the girl didn’t see this. The person spoke and they whispered in a modulated voice, “make yourself useful, tammy” and the girl asked “WHO ARE YOU?! HOW DO YOU KNOW ME?!” and then the masked person snapped their fingers. At the snap of the person’s fingers, the girl stopped and went into a trance, and she stopped and stayed still. (Maybe supernatural forces caused that?)

The figure put down a hobby knife set next to her. 

Her eyes dilated and she picked up a scalpel and started cutting into her face, slowly starting to smile as tears rolled down her cheeks. She started cutting faster and more aggressively until her face peeled off slowly and blood started pouring like a waterfall down her face and body. Her eyes rolling back in her head.

She started to smash her head rapidly near the camera, blood splattering everywhere, until the camera became dark red.

The figure wiped the blood off the screen with latex gloves and poured bleach over the girl’s body. After that was done. The person walked up to the camera and stopped recording. And text appeared reading “2 layers”  the broadcast went off air shortly afterwards. 

I then started to scream and run out of the room. I could not process what I saw. I took the tape out and threw it in a sock drawer.

I had insomnia for 5 months straight. I forgot about it after that time period and never recorded another broadcast again.
