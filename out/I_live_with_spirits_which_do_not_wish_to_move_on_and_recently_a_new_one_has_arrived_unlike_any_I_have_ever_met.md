I believe I first felt its presence two weeks ago.

I had been busying myself with the dishes that evening, I am only the resident here who needs to eat so there weren’t a lot of them by any means, but I had little to do then and thus was fine with anything to waste away the time. The faucet’s flow was the only noise there then, loud enough to drown out all others but mundane enough to fade into the background in my ears.

It was in that half-silence that I first felt that slight chill in my limbs, as if something tiny was crawling over my body here and there. Winter is soon to arrive; it was nothing remarkable. I turned off the faucet and stepped away from the sink, but that chill only grew stronger. It made its way over my body, crawling further and further until I finally knew that something wasn’t right. I turned around and observed the wide room, there was nothing there. No solitary figure, no strange shadow, nothing.

“You can show yourself, if you wish,”, I softly called. The dead fear as well, you must be gentle because of it. “There’s nothing to be afraid of. If you are there then you can appear in form, no one can harm anyone here.”

There was no response, though the chill faded way.

I turned on the faucet again, intent on finishing the chore, yet it returned then. That slight feeling which again grew deeper and deeper into my flesh. It grew until I turned around again to catch its source, “You don’t need to hide so!”, I gently called, “I know you are there!”, as if afraid of meeting my eyes, the chill faded away once more, and as it did, I could feel the room get warmer, an unseen source of cold vanishing from it.

Have you ever felt that source-less chill upon your skin? On lonely nights without company, when standing in seemingly seclusion, the building up of that strange, odd chill along your spine and bones?

We often do not even notice it until it has grown much too strong to ignore. What would you do then, when that strange chill passes over you? Would you feel as though you caught in the corner of your eye, some strange thing that should not be? As if there is another presence around you, lying out of sight, just waiting to disappear?

They all disappear eventually. Perhaps if the distance between me and one of you is scant enough then that presence could be trying to get to me.

\------------------

I first caught a glimpse of it ten days ago.

It was a few hours before noon, yet there was little sunlight to brighten up the halls of the manor, a harsh storm was brewing, and the winter fog had already begun making untimely appearances. As I made my way towards the library through one of the halls, the open windows let in some scarce light to create misty shafts.

It grew as I walked, crawling its way up my limbs and spine, growing colder as it crawled further, until it began to pierce me and I could ignore it no longer. I gasped as if I had just resurfaced from water after nearly drowning, and then jolted around to see what was its source. And this time I was not greeted by nothing.

It lasted for but a moment. I saw just a silhouette, a brilliant silhouette of mist and light which glowed with an otherworldly beauty in that dark hall, its shape barely resembled a person yet it was more brilliant than any person could be. My eyes were glued to it, and strangely I couldn’t find myself to say anything before It faded away, and with it the chill did so as well.

I snapped back, “Please! Don’t disappear again!”, I called, though the gentleness was overshadowed by desperation now, “Are you lost here? Nothing can do you harm here, so why must you disappear?”

I regretted those words as the beautiful figure did not reappear. I was sore for next several days then, wondering if it wouldn’t have fled if I had spoken lighter, yearning to see that brilliant silhouette again. How can someone dead have such an effect on you?

That evening, I headed out onto the manor’s porch, despite the long toll of time which they have faced in their years, the planks still stand strong, barely even creaking if stepped on. The fisherman was standing against the porch railing, fishing rod in one hand and the other tucked within his dusty coat. His fisherman's cap was half torn and eternally stained, and his loose pants and undershirt fared no better. His beard was of a similar quality as his clothes.

“Evening, young lady!”, he tipped his hat. His voice was as course as you would expect, but with that energy of one who found only joy in speaking.

“Good evening!”, I said, he would get upset if I did not meet his greetings, “Sorry for being a bit abrupt but have you, by chance, noticed anyone knew around? Or felt another presence perhaps?”

He furrowed his brow, but a smile of interest accompanied it, “Oh my, my, that is a quite a question, is it not? Hmmm… will we have another resident in this little home? I truly do not wish to share this porch with any more individuals, no matter how fine they may be.”, that was not an answer.

“Please answer the question.”, I said.

“Hmph, fine. Yes, there is someone else here. No, I cannot say more, some things are ‘dead business’, you know. I wouldn’t dare break such a code, why, I would never forgive myself for it! And I despise not forgiving my own actions! …”

There was no such thing as ‘dead business’, he simply adored derailing conversations.

I could get no more out of him, and thus I left him there with a thanks as polite as I could manage. The fisherman is one of many who I refer to as ‘residents’ here, those of the dead who simply ‘live’ in the manor and appear frequently at whatever positions or tasks they have set themselves up for. There are ‘visitors’ there as well, spirits who only linger for some little time while they move onto whatever comes next for them, or wherever next they may wish to visit. Some of them are friendly, some others have been difficult.

The world is filled with death aplenty, after all.

Some are like a soft embrace, long expected and welcomed. Some others I have seen are harsh and cruel. Abrupt and unwanted. The body must be abandoned all the same, but how can one who was cheated out of their time bear to just leave it all behind so?

\------------------

*She* next chose to appear to me one week ago.

I usually try to sleep in two separate four-hour shifts, it replenishes me all the same with the added blessing of not missing the depths of the nights in the manor, for reasons which still escape me, the dead seem to appear most frequently during dawn and sunset.  

I was in bed then, whether it was very early in the morning or far too late at night, I do not remember. The first chill which disturbed my sleep was not worrying, a cold wind entered through one of my windows as a loud snap tore it open. My eyes were closed, but the chill beat at me anyway. The heavy, impressive blankets were just so warm and comfortable, I felt the room getting colder yet had little desire to leave my fuzzy shelter.

But there was only so much those blankets could do, and the chill did eventually become unbearable until the room was probably no colder than the outside world. I got out of those sheets and walked towards the open window, shivering as I began to close it. The Winds of Winter had arrived in the season, and an open window and out of season nightgown were not enough to chase it away.

But the chill kept growing even after the window was shut, even when there was no more wind coming into the room. I tried to shake off the cold and stood in the middle of the room, observing the door and any dark corners where a silhouette may have been hiding. The thought of seeing it again almost excited me.

“It’s quite cold isn’t it, dear visitor?”, I softly spoke, “Wouldn’t it so much warmer if I could see you? I would love to see you. Wouldn’t it be so much warmer if you said something?”, I huddled under the chill, squeezing the useless nightgown in the cold and turning around to all the nooks of my chamber.

“You know you really don’t need to hide, right? No har-”, the words froze as I turned towards my bed. It was occupied.

It was a silhouette no longer, no, *she* was a silhouette no longer. She still had that ethereal light which had drawn my sight towards it in the hall, but unlike then she was now better formed. Light, dreamy eyes on a strikingly pale face, made paler still by that ghostly glow. Her dark hair was somewhat short like mine, and it It disturbed me to see that she looked young, a spirit that was not greyed always had that hint of tragedy within it. Her eyes gazed straight into mine.

I was frozen, for at least several seconds I just stood there without noise, my body forgetting even to shiver from the cold, but as if due to the fear of the chill growing further and consuming me whole, I conjured the strength to speak. I knew I had to comfort the spirit somehow or perish from the cold.

“Does that bed seem warm to you? You can have it all you want, there is nothing that is kept from anyone here. Anyone can find comfort in this manor.”

She did not say anything in return, I felt like a fool. The cold continued to gnaw at me, my body could no longer forget to shiver.

“Do you wish for something from me?”, I exhaled.

She continued to stare into my eyes, hers did not blink at all while mine were trying their best to fend off the cold. My breath was fully visible.

“Please,”, I called, “I cannot help you if you do not speak, please. Do you wish to be helped? Cold, sorrow, solitude, I can help you rid it all, please I-”

My words stopped, it was unbearable, if I had ever felt closer to dying than I did there then I did not remember. I whimpered coarsely, looking at my exhales spread visibly in the room. My legs gave way and I fell onto my knees, my skin had begun to almost burn, I could barely feel anything. But she still stared into my eyes, but I could not meet her gaze anymore, my eyes were begging to close, the fight in me slowly dying. I took a final look at her, sitting on the bed still, glowing with that otherworldly glow which made her hair seem like strands of light. Her eyes seemed sad as they saw mine giving way.

“You were the most beautiful ghost I ever saw.”, I managed to out those words, and then my eyes were shut. I did not expect anything after that.

But then it all vanished, and for a moment I thought my body had begun to truly burn, but I realized then that all that happened was that the chill had departed. I opened my eyes from where I lay a crumpled heap upon the floor, the bed was vacant. She had disappeared. I took in several long, deep breaths.

The door to my chamber snapped open and candlelight lit up the shadowed room. Housekeeper Sevak came inside and set down the candle before bending down to me.

 “Are you alright? I heard you fall and was rightly worried, young mistress!”, he said. He only appeared at night, patrolling the halls and cleaning away the dust from the floor and furniture, he found joy in repeating in death what he been doing in life.

 “No, ugh- help me up, Sevak,”, I continued exhaling as he put one of my arms over his shoulder and sat me down on the bed. Sitting on the same spot that she had been on a mere minute ago made me almost shiver again. But the bed was still surprisingly warm even while just being sat on.

“The manor has someone new again,”, I managed to say.

“Ah, that is interesting news. I shall have to make sure that these halls are pristine before dawn arrives then.”, he said solemnly.

“I- She did not speak anything, Sevak. I think she is troubled by something, I have never seen someone act as she did- if you feel a new presence anywhere, please tell me,”, I coughed, “Ugh- I am sorry I think I wish to be alone.”

“As you say, younger M. If I sense a new guest then I will ensure you hear of it.”, he seemed wanting to say something more, but he left the chamber in silence instead. The door softly closed behind him.

*‘Younger M*’, that is what he always called me when I spoke anything resembling an instruction. My grandmother was often called ‘M’ by him before she left us in the manor. It is only me nowadays, since the old woman joined the ones she cared for, the only warm person in our decaying manor is me. Though I believe the transient dead often make for company warmer than you would expect from the cold they emanate, warmer company than even some who still live. And because of that I can never just let the dead go.

As I lied in the warmth of my large bed again, I could not sleep. My thoughts were only of that spirit, I remembered her face, pale and surprisingly young. No face of a ghost had any right to be anything less than ancient in appearance. Perhaps that’s why she acted so differently.

When some die, sometimes they do not wish to move on to whatever is next. They cling to all that they can; despite having their destination be beyond death, they breathe life into things which should not have them, linger here in ways that they aren’t supposed to.

Sometimes they cry, and become afraid and confused as they linger behind, aware that they must not remain, but too afraid to move on. But some others instead are glad, and feel great joy and even comfort in their states of stagnancy, there are many of these that I have known and know, they are the warmest of them all. They are filled with fear at the thought of losing their bliss in whatever lies beyond, and so often choose to linger behind as long as they wish.

‘She’, as I have begun to just refer to her, I believe is meant to be a resident. One of the dead who stays in the manor until or if they move onto what lies next. No visitor stays here for so long, yet already since that encounter last week I have felt her chill at various points in the manor. I do not know if her appearing like that again frightens me because of the thought of the cold or if it excites me because of the thought of knowing what she wants.

Winter is soon to come. Stay warm, and perhaps if you feel a familiar chill, you could direct her towards me?
