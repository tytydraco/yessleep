Last summer, I spent a few weeks at my grandparents’ old farmhouse, helping them clean out years of clutter and doing some much-needed repairs. The house has always felt a bit eerie — creaky floors, drafty windows, and shadows that seemed to linger longer than they should. But nothing prepared me for what I found in the attic.

While rummaging through old boxes covered in dust and cobwebs, I came across a leather-bound journal. It was worn and fragile, the kind of book you wouldn’t expect to find tucked away in a place forgotten by time. The cover was embossed with faded initials, and the pages inside were yellowed and brittle.

Curiosity got the better of me, so I sat down right there in the attic and started to read. The journal belonged to a man named Edward, who apparently lived in the house during the 1940s. At first, the entries were innocent, detailing everyday life: the weather, work on the farm, and visits from neighbors. But as I flipped through the pages, the tone shifted dramatically.

Edward began describing strange happenings that escalated over time. It started with small oddities — misplaced items, strange noises in empty rooms, cold spots that he couldn’t explain. Then the entries grew darker, more desperate. He wrote about hearing footsteps echoing in the hallways late at night when he was alone. Whispers calling his name from places where no one could possibly be.

One entry made my blood run cold. He described waking up to shadowy figures standing in the corners of his bedroom, their forms shifting like smoke. He tried to scream but found his voice trapped, as if something was choking the sound from his throat.

Edward’s writing became more erratic with each page. He spoke of a presence watching him, following him, a dark force that refused to leave. The last entry was the most chilling — just a few scrawled lines barely legible in the fading ink:

“I am not alone. I never have been. And I never will be.”

I closed the journal, heart pounding. I wasn’t sure if I believed in ghosts or anything supernatural, but the feeling of unease was overwhelming. That night, I heard footsteps in the house — slow, heavy steps pacing across the floor above me. I told myself it was just the old house settling.

But the next night, the footsteps returned. And this time, there were whispers — faint, unintelligible at first, then clearer. I could swear someone said my name. I stayed frozen under my blanket, afraid to move, afraid to listen.

Over the next few days, the occurrences grew more intense. Doors I’d left closed would be open in the morning. Lights flickered without explanation. I even caught glimpses of shadows moving just beyond my peripheral vision. My grandparents brushed it off as the house’s quirks, but I knew something wasn’t right.

Last night was the worst. I was lying in bed when I heard footsteps slowly approaching my door. They stopped, and for a moment, silence. Then a cold breath brushed past my ear, and I heard a voice whisper clearly: “You’re not alone.”

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. The journal’s words haunt me, and the presence feels real, tangible. I’m scared to sleep, scared to be alone. If anyone has experienced something like this or knows what I should do, please help me. Because right now, I feel like whatever followed Edward home is still here — and it’s found me.
