Rita's pregnancy is progressing wonderfully as we approach her 30th week. Still, in these final moments she complains about being unable to drink. She is five months sober currently. Pastor Matthews suggests we start the ritual sooner rather than later. Doctor Yancy agreed, and instructed me to give Rita the first series of abdominal injections. After the initial pain subsided, the baby began to kick causing Rita mild discomfort. She left with complaints of chest pains, feeling like the baby was "trying to crawl up out of her". I prescribed extra strength antacids, and a few Tylenol. Our Parish will thrive again.

The pregnancy is progressing normally. Rita complains that she can hear the baby wailing at night. Psychiatric care may be advised. She complains of her cravings, she wants alcohol and funnily enough, sushi. Still craving that Hollywood life. Another round of injections at Dr. Yancy's command. The baby visually responded, kicking and pushing. Rita showed signs of intense distress and required sedation. Soon.

A Black Christmas 

 
Witnesses described the scene as "upsetting", "horrific", and "surreal" as local transplant; Rita Sawyer wandered into the Montana snow late Christmas evening. Around 8pm, neighbors noticed 36 year old Rita stumbling around covered in blood and what some describe as rancid smelling ink. Witnesses say in her arms was a bundle of inky sheets. Paramedics arrived on scene shortly afterwards.


"I find it downright disrespectful." One parishioner commented "She comes into our little slice of Heaven after tramping around Tinseltown, and has the nerve to ruin Christmas like this. My husband was in the middle of carving the goose for goodness sake!" 


"Rita's always been a bit of a drama queen, I mean that's all she knows." Added decorated veteran and church usher, Clark Warren.


It has been reported that Rita harmed herself and her unborn child in some kind of psychotic episode. Rita will be transported to an out of state psychiatric facility after being treated for her wounds.

Thursday January 1st, 1998 - Moonlight Cathedral Evening Service transcript [local access television]



11:45pm
Harlow Matthews: As the winter breeze calls through the dying branches we take this time to celebrate and remember what the cold brings.


Pastor Carson Matthews: Selenium 29:3 says "And he who wrought such barren misery will be tried and made pure. The blanket of darkness will lift. The valley will bloom. The garden will thrive under his corrupt blood." Now, we all know exactly what, or should I say who came around with this particularly barren winter. And though the catalyst has been tried and removed, we still have to purify the harbinger. 


[Infant crying]


Pastor Matthews: In a few minutes, as the clouds cover the moon, we will proceed to the cemetery and begin the purification ritual. 


Harlow Matthews: Selenium 34:17; "His wound was rotten with sin, black and rancid before the floodwaters came down, collecting where his heart should be. Suddenly he was without rot, without sin." [She presents a golden sickle to Pastor Matthews] 


Pastor Matthews: His wound was rotten with sin. 


[Infant wailing]


[Various gasps from the congregation]


[Something black is bleeding out of the baby and pooling underneath the pastor. He holds up the infant who immediately vomits a black substance onto his face]


Pastor Matthews: [anguished screaming]

Tuesday, January 27, 1998 - a nearby newspaper runs an article on increasing cases of an odd disease known as L.W. Syndrome. This condition affects children sometime in the womb, causing them to develop various serious deformities. The first of the two newest cases being a young boy in New York. He was born with an extreme growth and skeletal disorder, covered in white fur, and had developed a long prehensile tail by age three. The second case, a little girl born overseas also covered in white fur with a similar growth disease, and other physical deformities such as ear-like growths on the top of her head. Some past cases had been reported to have "discolored or foul smelling" blood, however the newest cases lack such symptoms.

Sally D'Angelo: Hello, I'm Sally D'Angelo with Libby Springs' Local Report. Gail Warren is out sick this evening, we wish her well. Just a few hours ago on this rainy evening, local authorities reported finding an abandoned infant downhill from the woods, near Pisgah Park Drive. Police say calls had been coming in for hours complaining about the sound of a baby wailing through the woods. 


Police Chief Rothschild [Pre-recorded]: We honestly thought it was a prank until we got out there. Sure enough this little baby was laid in the dirt, just fussing away.


Sally D'Angelo: The baby was brought to Springwater Medical where she is currently undergoing intensive care. When we return from our break, Macy Daxon with tips on how to keep yourself unseen this summer.

Patient Record


Name: Baby Doe
DOB: January 30, 1998
Current Conditions: Pneumonia, L.W. Syndrome


Physician's Notes:
Baby Doe cries constantly. Her tears, vomit, saliva, and blood are black. Her urine and feces is black. Her body is covered in a thick black fur, the skin underneath is dark brown. Baby Doe has two growths on the top sides of her head, as well as a developing tail. The body will not allow for any injections, as anything we attempt to administer seeps out. Her lungs are partially filled with fluid, but I think she will recover.


Upon stabilization, I suggest relocation of Baby Doe to the Calming Star Orphanage for further monitoring and experimentation.
Y. Kelso M.D.
