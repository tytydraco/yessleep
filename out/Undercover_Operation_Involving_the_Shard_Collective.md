I stand amongst a crowd of hundreds of figures, men and women alike, robed in white gathered to witness their holiest day: The Day of Transformation. For a cult, they could have thought of a better name. As I stood among the crowd, I couldn't help but question my own sanity. How had I managed to infiltrate this cult for so long without losing myself? The faces around me, filled with blind devotion, were a stark reminder of the fine line I walked every day.

I've been infiltrating the Shard Collective for almost a year now, meticulously gathering notes and piecing together their objectives. Their entire faith revolves around a deity they call Valthuan, hidden within a massive crystal monolith in some distant world thousands  of light years away.

The Shard Collective has gatherings all over the world, with members numbering in the tens of thousands. At first glance, their objective seems like any other religious group: to spread their faith. But they are different. Sure, they send their priests around the world to preach, but they also dispatch messengers to recruit individuals with special qualities.

I remember being approached by one of their messengers while on leave after a major sting operation conducted by the Institute. They claimed I possessed qualities that made me worthy of their cult. After reporting this to the Institute, I was assigned to this undercover operation.

One thing about being an undercover agent that can turn the stomachs of even the most experienced is that they cannot break their cover, no matter the cost. I have witnessed many atrocities from this cult that I have become desensitized to it, all of which targeted the unworthy. The sad part is that the unworthy make up about 90 to 95% of their group, those who joined thanks to the priests. Myself and the few others who were chosen were spared from these horrors.

All of the unworthy don’t know that they are unworthy. They believe that they are special and that they will make the world a better place through their devotion. Most of them are the poor and the unfortunate, people who have been marginalized and are desperate for something to believe in. The priests prey on their vulnerabilities, offering them hope and a sense of belonging. They are promised transformation and enlightenment, a chance to rise above their circumstances and contribute to a grand, world-changing vision.

These individuals cling to the cult’s promises, seeing it as their last chance for redemption and purpose. They endure the harsh rituals and strict doctrines, convinced that their suffering will lead to a greater good. It’s heartbreaking to see their faith manipulated in such a cruel way, their dreams twisted into tools of control and oppression.

Like cattle, the priests discreetly select from among the unworthy to be sacrificed under the false pretense of ascension. This usually ends in their death through ritualistic sacrifice. Their preferred method, which I have unfortunately witnessed the aftermath of many times, is akin to the bamboo execution method used in World War II.

The victim is positioned above a young bamboo shoot, known for its rapid growth. Over time, the bamboo grows and pierces through the victim's body. This method relies on the natural growth rate of bamboo, which can be surprisingly fast, to inflict prolonged suffering. The only difference is that the priests place black quartz beside the bamboo shoots. As the shoots penetrate the body, no blood is seen, and the victims are discovered mummified.

I have been explicitly warned never to enter the rooms during these rituals, as I would share the same fate.

Today, however, is the first time a ritual is to be conducted on a member of the chosen. For the first time, a member of the chosen is to undergo the transformation.  Fortunately, it is not me who was selected but Sayuri, a petite woman hailing from Japan. I can’t fathom why someone so down-to-earth and level-headed would join this accursed cult. Sayuri works a decent job that places her in the middle class. She lives alone, leading a seemingly ordinary life. Yet, something must have drawn her to the Shard Collective, something that made her believe in their promises of transformation and enlightenment.

Sayuri had always been a mystery to me. Despite her seemingly ordinary life, there was a quiet intensity in her eyes, a sense of purpose that set her apart from the others. She rarely spoke about her past, but I could tell that she carried a burden, a longing for something more. Perhaps it was a desire to escape the mundane, to find meaning in a world that often felt empty and unfulfilling. Whatever it was, it had led her to embrace the cult's teachings with a fervor.

I stand amongst the crowd of chosen and unworthy, waiting for the ritual to start. The ceremony is being held in a large, cavernous room on a small, uncharted island somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. It is night, and the darkness outside is only pierced by the flickering light of large torches. The island itself is a desolate place, consisting of large rocks with a mix of white and gray colors. Strangely, there are no stars or moon in the night sky, despite the absence of clouds.

The room is dominated by an altar made of white quartz, its surface gleaming in the torchlight. The altar resembles a makeshift bed, with a flat surface and raised edges that form a crude, rectangular frame. The edges are jagged and uneven, as if hastily carved. Behind the altar stands a towering quartz monolith, its presence imposing and otherworldly. The chosen and the unworthy alike stand in silence, their faces illuminated by the dancing flames. 

A white-robed figure steps forward from the front of the crowd and turns to face us. His entire face is obscured by a smooth, black mask, the darkest shade of black I have ever seen. The mask is featureless, with no visible eye, mouth, or nose holes. The blackness of the mask seems to absorb the light around it, creating an unsettling void where his face should be. From my position at the back of the crowd, I can't fathom how he can see through that thing, yet his movements are confident and deliberate, as if he has no need for sight.

“Welcome all to the Day of Transformation,” the masked figure announced, his voice calm yet commanding. He raised his arms, the sleeves of his robe billowing as he gestured towards the monolith. “We are gathered today to witness a transformation. An ascension of one’s pathetic human form to a perfect body envisioned by our deity. Valthuan has spoken to me and chosen Sayuri to undergo this rare ritual.”

I see Sayuri step out from the crowd. She turns around and bows to everyone. She wears the typical white robe but kept the hood down. Then, she sits at the altar.

“Valthuan!” The masked figure turns towards the monolith and addresses it. “Sayuri, your chosen one, is here and ready.”

The monolith, a towering structure of quartz, begins to shimmer brilliantly in an array of colors, its surface reflecting the torchlight in mesmerizing patterns. The monolith stands imposingly behind the altar, its presence both awe-inspiring and terrifying. As if acknowledging the masked figure's words, the monolith emits a bright black beam of light that envelops Sayuri. She closes her eyes, and her entire body, from the ground up, begins to encase itself in a clear crystal. Wherever the crystal touches, that part of her body becomes as transparent as the crystal itself. The crystallization continues until it encases her head, leaving her entire form within a huge, rectangular block of ice-like crystal.

After what felt like an eternity, the crystal block began to crack, a thin fissure snaking its way down from the top. A brilliant light pulsed from within, growing brighter with each passing second. Then, with a deafening shatter, the crystal exploded, sending shards flying in all directions.

When the light fades, I see the being that used to be Sayuri appear before us. She is perfectly smooth and as clear as ice, her form now a humanoid figure of pure crystal with jagged features. Her head is featureless, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or hair, giving her an eerie, alien appearance. She hovers roughly two feet above the altar, her presence both ethereal and menacing. Shards of crystal litter the floor around her.

The audience, including myself, gasps in awe and fear at the transformation. The unworthy fall to their knees, whispering prayers and praises to Valthuan, while the chosen stand in stunned silence, their faces reflecting a mix of reverence and terror. Even the masked figure seems momentarily taken aback, his confident demeanor faltering. Everyone present now realizes the true power of the monolith and the god it represents.

Suddenly, the masked figure began to panic, his voice trembling as he addressed the monolith. "Please, Valthuan, forgive me," he pleaded, his hands shaking as he clasped them together. "We... I didn’t know that one of the chosen is a spy. I will deal with it right away… No. Don’t do this. Please, I beg you."

I saw the being hover slowly towards the masked figure. In a desperate attempt to escape, he dashed for the nearest exit but suddenly stopped, frozen in place. "No! Please, have mercy!" he cried out, his voice breaking with fear. Sayuri, or rather the entity she had become, appeared to punch a hole through the back of his body where his heart was located. However, no blood left his body, and Sayuri remained unstained. In mere seconds, the robed figure's skin began to shrivel and tighten, his flesh desiccating rapidly. His body became gaunt and skeletal, as if all the moisture and life force had been drained from him. What looked like his soul left his body, screaming in agony as it got absorbed by the monolith.

Then, Sayuri turns towards my direction, staring at me with that eyeless face.

A cold wave of dread washed over me as I realized my identity had been discovered. Panic surged through my veins, and I bolted for the nearest exit. But before I could take more than a few steps, an invisible force clamped down on me, freezing me in place. I could feel the sweat trickling down my back, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps. I was utterly helpless.

I have never felt this level of paralysis before. I could see, I could hear, I could breathe, I could even talk. But I couldn’t move my arms or legs, turn my head, or even blink. It was as if an invisible force had wrapped itself around me, holding me in a vice-like grip. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat echoing loudly in my ears. With my back facing the crowd, all I could do was wait and accept my fate.

Then, I heard the sounds of dozens of people screaming behind me, each one expressing pain and agony too terrible to bear. The fate of the robed figure was not his alone today; it was shared by everyone, including myself. The cacophony of screaming lasted for what felt like hours, each cry a piercing note of terror and suffering. The screams grew louder, more frantic, as if the very essence of the crowd was being torn apart. Then, slowly, the screaming began to die down, fading into a haunting silence.

I felt Sayuri’s presence behind me, hovering closer and closer. Inch by inch. I could see a faint shadow growing on the floor. Then, at the top of my vision, I could see her, floating down slowly, all the while facing me with her faceless head. Her presence was a cold, oppressive force, pressing down on me with an intensity that made my skin crawl.

I wanted to close my eyes, but the paralysis prevented me. Now, all I had to do was wait and accept whatever fate she had judged me to take.

But she stood still, hovering in place, not making a single twitch or move. Suddenly, my surroundings began to warp around me. The ground below me morphed into some sort of glossy, black jagged flooring. Quartz monoliths began to grow quickly around me. The cacophony of screams I heard before began to rise tenfold. And behind Sayuri stood a tall monolith, taller and wider than the Eiffel Tower. It shimmered and displayed a brilliant array of colors that I had never seen in my life.

Sayuri slowly hovered to the ground and started to walk to my left side. The sounds of her footsteps continued until she was right behind me.

The tower in front of me suddenly stopped shimmering and became clear, almost perfectly invisible. Only the vague outlines told me that it was right in front of me. Then I saw two extremely large bright white lights form inside the tower. They appeared to be eyes, staring right at me.

We gazed at each other for minutes, then I felt visions invading my thoughts. Visions of my village, suddenly converted into a forest of quartz obelisks. Each building was destroyed and penetrated by these crystalline structures, their jagged forms tearing through walls and roofs with relentless force. The once vibrant streets were now littered with debris, the remnants of homes and shops reduced to rubble.

People fled in terror, their screams echoing through the air as they tried to escape the chaos. Formless figures, dark and shadowy, moved with an eerie fluidity, gliding across the ground and through the air. These entities seemed to absorb the very essence of life from everyone they touched. As they reached out with tendrils of darkness, the vibrant colors of the fleeing villagers drained away, leaving behind only grey, soulless husks.

The vision was a nightmare of destruction and desolation. The village, once a place of life and community, where I grew up with my beautiful family, was now a twisted landscape of crystalline obelisks and lifeless corpses. 

Then another vision formed. A crystal being, similar to Sayuri but larger, more imposing, and much more powerful than her, roamed the earth with a host of creatures behind it. These creatures resembled humans but constantly morphed in ways that defied the laws of physics. They would stretch and compress, becoming huge and tiny, short and long, simultaneously, all at once. Their limbs twisted and contorted, bending at impossible angles, while their bodies expanded and contracted in a grotesque dance of transformation. 

Where the host lay, I could see forests of obelisks, each one containing a human being. These humans were trapped in a state of perpetual agony, their forms constantly shifting in ways that seemed inhumanly possible and excruciatingly painful. Their skin would ripple and bulge, bones protruding and retracting as if their very essence was being torn apart and reassembled over and over again. Faces would melt and reform, eyes would multiply and disappear, and mouths would open in silent screams, only to vanish and reappear elsewhere on their bodies.

The sight was a nightmarish tableau of suffering and distortion, a twisted mockery of human existence. The crystal being moved with an eerie grace, its faceless head reflecting the torment of those it commanded. It was a harbinger of chaos, leading its ever-morphing minions across the landscape, leaving behind a trail of destruction and despair

The vision zoomed into the faceless head of this crystal champion. That’s when I could see my face reflecting off it with an expression of joy and malice.

Then, darkness overtook me.

I woke up to a horrendous scene in the cavern where the ritual was hosted. Sayuri was gone, but she had left behind a graveyard of corpses, each one nothing but skin and bones. The air was thick with the stench of death, and the silence was deafening. I struggled to comprehend the magnitude of the devastation around me.

I called my supervisor, my voice trembling as I described the scene. They sent a rescue team within an hour. As I waited, I couldn't shake the images of the visions from my mind. The crystal obelisks, the formless figures, the lifeless bodies—they haunted me.

Upon my helicopter ride back to Facility XJV-06, I reflected on what I saw, the visions imposed upon me. The rhythmic thrum of the helicopter blades did little to calm my racing thoughts. I didn’t understand what it all meant, and I was afraid to find out. The visions had shown me a world of unimaginable suffering and transformation, and I feared that it was a glimpse of what was to come.

Needless to say, my identity was compromised, and I needed to serve a different function in the Institute. After almost a year of assessments and evaluations, I was deemed worthy of continuing to serve the Institute. The process was grueling, filled with endless psychological evaluations and physical tests. They needed to ensure that I was still fit for duty, that the trauma I had experienced hadn't broken me.

At this point, I will continue my role as internal security. The familiar routines and responsibilities provided a semblance of normalcy, a way to ground myself after the chaos I had endured. Each day, I patrolled the halls of Facility XJV-06, the memories of the ritual and the visions never far from my mind. But at least I am not lonely like I used to be. A small, beautiful lady, Hana, is also stationed near me. We talk a lot about our lives and have fun. I think I might actually like her in a romantic way.

But somehow, she seems familiar. I can’t put my finger on it, but it seems that I found a long-lost friend. There’s a comfort in her presence, a sense of déjà vu that I can’t quite explain. As we spend more time together, I find myself drawn to her, not just because of her beauty, but because of the unspoken connection we share.

Despite the horrors I have witnessed, there is a glimmer of hope in this new chapter of my life. Hana keeps grounding me, comforting me, reminding me that the horrors I experienced are nothing compared to the greatness that I will accomplish in the near future.

I don’t know what that means. Maybe it’s the way she speaks, with an accent that hints at a distant homeland. Or perhaps it’s the way her eyes, though warm and inviting, sometimes seem to hold a depth of knowledge and experience far beyond her years. But I feel that she might be right. That I am destined for greatness someday.
