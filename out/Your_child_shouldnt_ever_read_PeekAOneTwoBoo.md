Don’t read this book if it stumbles upon you.

I say that because you won’t stumble upon *it*.

My name’s Josiah, and I’m the single father of a two-year-old boy named Robbie. Named after his mother, Roberta. I hope Robbie feels some sort of connection, when he’s older, to the mother he never met — never *will* meet, thanks to the obstetrician who failed to perform that emergency C-section in a timely manner.

The last two years have trialled and taxed me; taxed my soul to bankruptcy. I’m deep in the red now, with nothing but pain left to pay my debts. Yet, this past week has been the most nightmarish. More nightmarish, even, than seeing my own wife’s body on that icy, steel examination table.

On Monday, Carl and Mary came over. They visit most evenings, actually. I teasingly call it their date night. Anyway, they gifted a children’s story titled:

*Peek-A-One-Two-Boo: He Who Shows For Supper*

It was a broad, hardy book with paperboard pages. On its cover, against a white backdrop, was a picture of a woman with one hand covering her right eye. She wore a sprawling and unseemly smile — wily, too, as if she were privy to some awful secret; a secret specifically about me.

Anyway, my eyes were drawn to small, black letters beneath her disembodied head and hand. *Peek-a-one*. And beside her was a man, grinning even more atrociously, with hands covering both eyes. Naturally, then, he was labelled: *Peek-a-two.* However, there was no *Peek-a-boo*. Given the name of the book, I had expected that to be the natural conclusion.

“Mary found this whilst cleaning out her grandfather’s attic,” Carl explained. “I said you might want it for Robbie.”

I didn’t, but Carl was a good friend and a sensitive soul; it would’ve hurt his feelings for me to reject the present. Screw me for being a people pleaser. And I know that sounds ungrateful, but it’s hard to articulate what unnerved me. I just didn’t like the look of the book; all frayed around the edges and ridden with mould from an attic untouched for years.

Most of all, I didn’t like what Mary had squealed before her husband passed the book to me.

“I used to love this story as a child. Would’ve kept reading it forever if Grandpa hadn’t hidden it from me.”

*What an odd thing to say*, I thought.

Only, it wasn’t odd. It was, in some unexplained way, downright terrifying.

I sent my two closest friends home around six in the evening, as I wanted to put Robbie to bed — also wanted to be alone. I love the heck out of Carl and Mary, but they fuss and fuss. Fuss until my head pounds and I reflexively reach for Mr Merlot, my dearest friend of all.

Anyhow, just before bedtime, I started reading Peek-A-One-Two-Boo to a giggling Robbie as he squirmed in my lap. The eight-paged book told the tale of a bizarre man named He Who Shows For Supper.

>*He shows when you need him*

>*Shows for supper and rest*

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

On *Page One*, there was a home’s front hallway with an open door looking onto blackness. Blackness beyond night. It felt, to my eyes, painful. More than a printing error. Something was there, worming through the dark.

>*And should you not feed him*

>*He’ll be far from his best*

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

On *Page Two*, there wasn’t a dining table, but a bathroom; hardly the right setting for crockery and dining utensils. A blue, floral shower curtain was drawn across the bath. A drape open only a tad at the side of the tub, but the gap was wide enough to reveal a head-shaped shadow on the tiled wall. The head of something sitting in the bath. At least, it *looked* like a head, presumably belonging to the visitor: He Who Shows For Supper. But I wasn’t convinced by that, and I didn’t like the image at all. Didn’t like any of it.

>*So set out the china*

>*And a tall glass of red*

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

On *Page Three*, a set of manly hands cradled an empty wine glass and a white plate of some brown, indiscernible dish — like an artist’s unfinished afterthought or a haunting thing that the publisher had decided to censor. I leant towards the latter. But that unsettled me, so I tried to convince myself it had been either a misprint or an ink smudge from decades of damp.

>*The bath must be running*

>*For the bump on his head*

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

On *Page Four*, through the lulling shower curtain, the bathroom light cast a silhouette of what still seemed to be a head. Unlike the third page, however, it had sprouted a large lump.

>*Just turn both your eyeballs*

>*And keep his growth low*

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

On *Page Five*, the bathwater was overflowing — running over the upper rim of the tub in streaks of a murky brown; ink that I hoped, like the blurry meal on the third page, to be an unintended discolouration of some sort.

>*And once his head’s level*

>*He should get up and go*

On *Page Six*, there was an image staring down the barrel of the upstairs hallway, directly to the bathroom’s open door. And within that tall frame was only blackness, much like that very first image. Oh, believe me, I wanted to stop reading, but I didn’t. Couldn’t, perhaps.

>*But if not, then oh, no*

On *Page Seven*, there was only white text against a black page.

>*Peek-a-one, peek-a-two, peek-a-one-two-boo*

And in reverse, on *Page Eight*, there was only black text against white.

“Well, that was haunting, Robbie,” I said as the boy sucked his thumb and contentedly eyed me. “Thanks, Mary, for sharing your childhood trauma with us. Peek-a-boo.”

“Pikachu…” Robbie said, tittering away gleefully in my lap.

“Nearly,” I laughed. “Boy, do I wish we were watching Pokémon.”

“*BOO!*” my son loudly responded, making me jump; making himself chuckle more noisily.

“Are you proud of yourself for that?” I asked, stifling a laugh. “I’m glad one of us enjoyed it.”

“Bed,” Robbie yawned, mashing his eyes with tiny, balled-up fists.

“Is it bedtime for me?” I teased. “Or for peek-a-*you*?”

“*Peek-a-one-two-boo*,” hissed a voice small, child-like, but *false*.

Instinctively, my fearful eyes shot down to Robbie. Mid-yawn, the boy dozily eyed his racecar bed. Now, it could’ve been him who whispered those five horrid words in quick succession, but it wasn’t. Robbie rarely strings more than a pair of words together. He occasionally stretches to three words, and perhaps even four, but not five. And not *those* five. Certainly not in such a clear, eloquent manner. And not in such a hushed whisper.

I blamed it on sleep-deprivation, like everything else; everything that happened to me, and everything I made happen. Then I put both the book and Robbie to bed. I don’t remember what I ate or watched on the television from there onwards. My life has been a series of motions for a long time. I live so that Robbie lives.

I blinked, then it was Tuesday. I invited Carl and Mary over, and they didn’t need to be asked twice. It’s a rarity for me to reach out. Of course, they weren’t expecting to be apprehended.

“This isn’t a children’s book,” I said, waving Peek-A-One-Two-Boo in their faces before they’d even taken off their coats. “It’s a horror story about a stranger eating supper in the bath.”

Mary raised an eyebrow, eyed her husband, then she laughed. “I don’t know what you read last night, but it wasn’t Peek-A-One-Two-Boo.”

“What?” I asked.

She smirked, then replied, “Grandpa read that book to me every single day. I remember the story. It’s about a picnic on a train.”

I answered by thrusting the book into my friend’s hands, and she rolled her eyes before skimming through the pages. But her face quickly whitened.

“What?” she whispered. “Josiah, this isn’t… I don’t understand. This must be, I don’t know, some other book in the Peak-A-One-Two-Boo series?”

“Well, you tell me,” I said. “You gave it to me. This haunting thing.”

“You sound just like Grandpa,” Mary smirked. “He hated it too. I even caught him throwing the book out once. It ended up right back in the living room though. Gosh, you should’ve seen the look on his face when it showed up. Like he’d seen a ghost.”

Something deeply unnerved me about that anecdote. And I was so focused on Mary that I didn’t even realise Carl had the book in his hands.

“He shows when you need him,” he read. “For some—”

But before my friend made it any farther, he was interrupted by knocking on the front door. Something that made Mary and Carl chuckle. And part of me — the part that still believes, in some way, that monsters live under my bed — expected to see a man at the door.

But it was the pizza delivery boy, standing in the rain and frowning. Frowning as thick, murky water poured off the lip of the awning onto his face. It was, strangely, muddying his face, and he quickly shoved the boxes into my hands before scurrying away.

Well, obviously, I thought my home’s exterior might need a clean. However, when I stepped off the porch to take a look, I was also muddied; muddied by rain from the very sky above. Water just as filthy as that trickling off the edge of my awning. Brown paste marring my skin. And strangely, as I looked out at the neighbourhood beyond my property line, the rain looked clearer. As if some dirty cloud were hanging only above my house.

“Josiah!” Carl called from the other end of the hallway. “The pizza’s getting wet.”

“And so are you,” Mary added.

“Right, yeah… You too,” he chuckled. “You look filthy, mate! Get inside.”

Wednesday was a quiet day. I noticed the hollow wine rack in the kitchen, which incensed me to send a scathing group message to my two friends. I told them never to steal from me again, then I tossed the phone onto the sofa. Instead, I narrated Peek-A-One-Two-Boo to Robbie, as I needed a distraction from the throb in my skull; the withdrawal symptoms, I suppose. I don’t have a *problem*\-problem. I’m just grieving. Anyway, when I got to the fourth page of the book, Robbie’s chortling voice vanished.

“Bed now,” Robbie interrupted coldly.

I smiled. “Too scary? We’re nearly there, Robbie. Just a…”

My son’s tiny hand fell atop mine, like a pet’s paw, and stopped me from turning the page. Then he gave me a look. Looked at me with *adult* eyes. I don’t know how else to explain it. There was a sense of knowing in them. A two-year-old’s eyes should be shallow — too shiny and new to have experienced anything. To have been weathered. But Robbie’s eyes had seen something. That was the story they told.

“NO!” he shouted.

We both had an early night.

On Thursday, I was entirely stunned when Robbie wanted to hear the story again.

“Really?” I asked, laughing. “Last night, you really didn’t want—”

“Book!” he cried.

“I’m fine with that,” I said calmingly. “But what do we say first?”

“Please,” Robbie replied.

I nodded and began to read. “He shows when you need him. Shows for supper and rest.”

Like Carl, I was interrupted, but there came no knock on the door this time. What cut into my narration was a breeze whistling into the room. It startled me, as I was certain I hadn’t opened Robbie’s bedroom window — not given the frosty weather.

“Daddy!” Robbie cried, pointing at the open book resting on the duvet. “Book!”

I closed the window and frowned a little, as the chill remained. Not from the air that had already slipped through the opening. No, this was a fresh breeze seeping into my home from somewhere else.

“Daddy…” Robbie moaned impatiently as I walked back over.

“I’m coming as quickly as my joints will allow,” I groaned before sitting down beside him.

When I picked up the book, I frowned. It was open on a different page. Page Three. And the paperboard was damp — seemed to be getting damper in my fingers, as if something were dripping onto it from a hidden place.

“The bath must be running for the bump on his head…” I read in a low whisper. “Robbie, this page is wet. Did you do this?”

“Peek-a!” Robbie replied, jabbing at the next line for me to continue.

I sighed and nodded.

“Peek-a-one,” I said, before dropping the book onto the duvet, then I placed a hand over my left eye as my son started to giggle. “Peek-a-two…”

When I covered the other eye with my free hand, plunging my vision into total darkness, I noticed that the room fell very still. *Robbie* fell very still.

Then I croaked, “Peek-a-one, two, *BOO*!”

I removed both hands to playfully spook my soon, but I was the one who screamed. Robbie was shivering, and he started to bawl when I screamed. After all, my frightened reaction revealed what he’d already suspected: that something was not right with him.

It wasn’t the wetness that scared me; it was the redness. Robbie had been soaked from head to toe in reddish-brown water. It travelled along the carpet from his body to the open door. From the open door to the unlit bathroom across the landing.

I picked him up, cradled him, and tried to stifle his sobs. Tried to stifle my own sobs. Then I noticed something else painted red. The page of the open book on the duvet below. One specific line of one specific page, to be exact, had been highlighted not with a teacher’s red marker, but with blood.

*The bath must be running*, I thought.

Through Robbie’s open doorway, I saw the upstairs bannister; a barrier above the staircase below. And there followed two things from the steps. A creak and a shadow. More than a shadow. It was purest black, like the doorframes pictured in the book.

I felt something. There was only the one creak, *but I felt something*. Yes, it could’ve been the house’s foundations settling. Could’ve been lots of things, but it wasn’t. It was the steps. And, yes, there was only one creak, but that was irrelevant.

I knew something was walking up the steps.

That was why I dashed to the bathroom with a red-stained Robbie in my arms. I flipped the light-switch, shot to the tub, punched the plug into the drain, and twisted the hot tap to its fullest extent. I was hoping, admittedly, to see red water pour from the faucet; confirmation that I hadn’t imagined any of it.

But then, moving invisibly, the shower curtain drew to both the left and the right, fully shielding the bathtub from view.

I stumbled backwards, pressing Robbie’s face deeply in my chest so he didn’t see. I didn’t want to make his bawling worse by screaming, but heaven knows I nearly did. And anyone else would’ve screamed, or near-enough screamed, having seen what I saw through the shower curtain. A silhouette against the fabric. A tub-sitter with a large lump on the head.

The figure leant forwards and dipped his head into the sloshing water. Then came slurping; vile, ear-scratching slurps that filled the small room. Someone sat in that tub and *drank* from it. And I noticed, as I watched, that the silhouette changed. That, as written in the book, the lump on the man’s head started to flatten and shrink.

Then, as suddenly as it started, came an end to the nightmare.

With a thunk, the bathroom light turned off and all fell silent. But I felt him in the dark. Felt him come close to Robbie and me, so I darted towards the light switch and flipped it again.

The light returned to reveal red, watery footprints across the bathroom floorboards, the landing, and down the stairs.

I accepted, at long last, that this wasn’t sleep-deprivation.

I video-called Carl, hysterical showing him the red footprints throughout my house. He asked whether I’d spilt some wine; whether I’d been drinking again. We exchanged words, and I hung.

On Friday, I didn’t go to work. I spent the day with Robbie and wore a brave face, but even toddlers know a lie. He saw it in my face, and he was uncharacteristically quiet. I was simply thankful that his eyes were, at least, innocent once more. Thankful that we weren’t reading that wretched book for once. Thankful that we seemed to be making it through the night without incident.

Then, of course, around seven in the evening, came a knock on the front door. And I was ready to wail for mercy until Carl’s voice came from the other side.

“Josiah?” he called.

I breathed a sigh of relief.

“Look,” Carl continued. “I’m sorry for the way our call ended last night. Mary’s worried about you. I’m worried about you.”

I panted heavily. “Thanks, Carl, but Robbie and I just want a quiet night. I don’t feel like talking tonight. I’m sorry.”

“Please, mate,” he begged. “We’ve supported you for two years, but you’re not well. We love you, and we loved Roberta too, so—”

“Don’t mention her,” I whimpered.

“I want what’s best for you and Robbie,” he said. “Please, don’t hide away. Not again. I’m scared. Do I need to call someone? Are you safe?”

“I told you last night,” I groaned. “We are *not* safe. There’s something wrong with Mary’s book. Robbie feels it too.”

“Robbie feels…” Carl started to repeat, then he scoffed exasperatedly. “Do you hear yourself, Josiah? You’re not tired. You’re drunk. If you keep this up, Robbie’s going to lose his father too.”

“Leave,” I snarled.

He sniffled. “No. You won’t push me away.”

“I’m not drunk,” I cried. “Just leave. Just—”

“Okay,” the man icily interrupted.

I paused, pressing my ear against the wood to hear his quietening voice more clearly. “What?”

“I said, ‘Okay’,” Carl repeated, feet clacking against stone as he stepped back. “You win, Josiah. I’ll go.”

I frowned, but meekly answered, “Thank you.”

“Oh, and Josiah?” my friend continued. “I wasn’t entirely honest with you.”

“What?” I asked, throat almost too swollen to let the word out.

“Well, you see, I *do* believe you,” Carl whispered with a new voice; one with bottomless depth. “*Peek-a-one, two…*”

The front door flung open, sending my body across the carpet, but I propped myself up on my elbows near-immediately; some paternal reflex. I thought only of Robbie shuddering on the sofa beside his father’s floored body. And then I screamed as I saw the blackness in the doorframe, just as I’d seen it on the stairs — in the book too.

There was something in the void, and it wasn’t Carl.

The blackness started to collect; started to fold into itself. And a man emerged, standing against the world beyond, clear to my eyes once again.

He Who Shows For Supper.

He looked like something, but my eyes won’t tell me. Wouldn’t pass that image to my brain. To my memory. It would’ve imploded my very soul. There are things unfit for the mortal gaze, and *he* was one of them.

I scooped Robbie off the sofa and took flight. Flew upstairs, two or three steps at a time, I’d wager; I’m not sure. My mind erased more than the thing that stood in the doorway. But I remember the sounds. Those haunting sounds. Whistles beating against the house’s outer walls. Creaks of either the visitor following us up the stairs or synapses tearing in my mind; letting me float aimlessly in my mind, so that I didn’t have to remember any of it.

But I remember clutching Robbie so tightly that I left bruises in his skin. That was how desperately I did not want him to see the face of He Who Shows For Supper.

I beelined to Robbie’s room, as his window sits above the awning. From there, we could climb to freedom. There were so many things I didn’t think about, you see. The sounds surrounding the house. The sounds *within* the house. I opened the door to a wall of red; a gushing tide of red water, fully clean at last, that bluntly pummelled my son and me.

Whatever happened next was another impossibility. Within a single moment, that wave of red had filled all. Filled every room in the house from floors to ceilings. And I found myself swirling, son in my arms, underwater. Entirely submerged. Maybe, in truth, it had taken minutes. Hours. My brain had been bludgeoned into blackness. All I know is that I was gripping my boy feverishly, open eyes stinging against the red, but unable to see through the thick colour. Still, I guided myself by intuition and kicked forwards with rudder-like feet.

I felt Robbie wriggle in my arms, so I knew he was alive. That kept me swimming through his underwater room. Lungs almost full to the top with filth, I finally found the wall; then I found the window latch, and I managed to wrench it upwards.

Once the window had swung outwards into the world, there followed a watery vortex; tugging at my body — I braced against the window frame as the house drained like a bathtub. The water level dropped below my head within seconds, and I lifted a spluttering Robbie above the surface. With forceful pats, I coaxed him into vomiting out the heavy redness, letting air back into his lungs.

Then I clambered out of the window, clothes drenched and stained, but I didn’t see He Who Shows For Supper. I saw Carl and Mary standing on the front lawn, covered from head to toe in the red tidal wave that had just poured out of my house; had filled the lawn, seeped onto the road, and almost drowned the pair of them. Two sodden, blood-soaked rats.

And it was blood. We didn’t need tests to prove that. I tasted it on my tongue. It just helped to think of it as red. I didn’t fully accept the truth of what had happened until I saw the looks on Carl and Mary. They saw it all too. The blood. Felt it against their skin.

But that was not all.

As if woken from a deep sleep, Mary recalled something deeply buried. Her grandfather had once told her of a train journey that he took with his brother, many years earlier; one that ended in his brother’s disappearance. And in the pages of Peek-A-One-Two-Boo, her grandfather told her that there lurked details which haunted him. Things far too linked to his own life.

“He said a man came for him,” Mary whispered, still soaked in blood like the rest of us. “He Who Shows For Supper. And Grandpa didn’t remember him.”

“I don’t either,” I whispered.

Mary shivered, sobbing. “I do. I’m so sorry for giving it to you, Josiah. He made me forget. He…”

“What is he?” I asked hoarsely.

My friend blubbered and shook her head ferociously. “No. Please. I don’t… Don’t make me describe him. He’ll see me again. I don’t want to see him again.”

Then Mary screamed at the wall — the blood-stained wall of my blood-stained lounge. There was nothing to see when Carl and I turned, but I knew something was there. Much as something had been there in the blackness. And when we shot our heads back to Mary, Carl and I certainly saw something terrible.

She was slashing blood, from every surface imaginable, *directly* *into her eyes*. Screaming as she did so.

“*I DON’T SEE YOU!*” Mary shrieked into the nothingness. “*GO AWAY!*”

An equally blood-stained Carl took his wife’s shaking hands and sobbed alongside her. “Stop it… STOP! It’s over now, Mary… Please stop.”

I saw something in her blood-soaked eyes. Not the shape of the man. That terror would’ve been smaller — easier to swallow. No, this was something familiar. A deep shade painted across Mary’s pupils. And I’d seen it, once before, on the face of the only other person who knew; the one who communicated to me, with fear but not words, that he had seen and *remembered* the face of He Who Shows For Supper.

I’d seen those knowing eyes on [Robbie](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
