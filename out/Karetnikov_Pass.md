I need to preface this by saying that I have looked everywhere for any evidence of the existence of Karetnikov Pass, and couldn't find anything. I know it's real, and I know what I saw, but it's like any evidence of it was erased from existence.

I needed some time away from real life for a bit, so I decided to go camping. Finding an appropriate site that wasn't already too popular, or ruined by other campers who mistreated the beauty of nature was difficult. I went down a long list of four and five star campsites on Google Maps, and none of them really fit all my criteria. Until I came across one four star rating with only a handful of reviews. It barely had any interaction, but I looked up pictures of it and it was gorgeous, this dusty green mountain with some of the most pleasant viewpoints. Notably, it overlooked a lake and what looked like a small, Victorian gothic town.

While I was browsing photos of the mountain, I found a few articles about mysterious disappearances and supposed supernatural sightings, and an article about a civil war that had taken place in 1913. Now, I'm an avid horror and history fan, so I wasn't as put off by this as I probably should have been. In fact, the opposite was true, I was intrigued by it all. I figured I could stop by the town on my way to the pass, and ask around about their history.

To save time, I won't go into too many details about the weeks leading up to the camp. It's pretty much all you'd expect from some artist's daily life. Nothing of note really happened. The first notable instant was on my drive to Karetnikov Pass. I had been driving for almost three hours, the radio clock ticked just past 21:30. I don't know exactly where I was, but it was somewhere along Route 2A. I do know I was nearing the dirt road that lead to the town under the mountain.

A few hundred feet away from said turn, I could swear I saw a girl in a white dress. It seemed like she was hitchhiking. Now, I pride myself on being a good Samaritan, so I pulled over to offer her a ride. As I did so, however, my phone pinged. So I pulled to a stop and checked the notification. It was a text from an unknown number that simply read, "I'm sorry.", I brushed it off and looked back up, and the girl had vanished. Okay, weird, but I'd been awake all day and it was getting late, so I just wrote it off, even with a little voice at the back of my head trying to tell me it had something to do with the nearby town.

I pulled off into the dirt road and made my way towards the town. Again, nothing of note for most of that drive, which only took a few minutes. After a while, I turned the corner that led onto an old, grimy looking tar road, it had a large, askew sign nailed to a tree next to the road. It read "Population, 6--". The only clear number was the six, the rest had been scratched out, or faded over time. I followed the tar road into what was clearly an abandoned town. Empty streets filled with cracks and potholes, broken windows and decayed wooden doors. A ghost of a once beautiful town. There went my hopes of talking to people about it, but such is the way with time, right? I stopped at a gas station at the edge of town to have dinner.

I stepped out of the car to stretch my legs, and just sort of wandered around the gas station taking in the sights. Admittedly, not much, but I was fascinated by the feeling of such liminal spaces. On the wall right next to the broken down door, there was a sign with a list of rules, which seemed a little out of place. Why would the laws be on a random gas station the edge of town? I figured it was a small town and probably one of the few places that had a local sheriff enforcing the laws, and they were likely littered around town. The place was rather out of the way, after all. I'll transcribe the rules here, since they seemed odd, even for a small, out of the way town;

1. Curfew is from 9 PM until 8 AM, everything excluding emergency services are to be closed. No exceptions. 
2. Emergency services are advised to lock their doors and cooperate with local law enforcement in case of emergencies. 
3. If any citizen is found in the streets after curfew, they will be placed under arrest for the remainder of the night.
4. If you encounter anyone other than local law-enforcement during curfew, do not engage.
5. Keep all your doors and windows locked during curfew. No exceptions.
6. Do not answer your door during curfew. Do not pay attention to anyone claiming to be in need of help or even a family member who claims to have lost their key.
7. If any of your relatives or loved ones are not home by curfew, inform local law enforcement via telephone.
8. If you can not make it to your home in time for curfew, remain inside your vehicle or call local law enforcement.
9. If you can not do the above, **remain where you are.** You will be found and taken into custody by local law enforcement.
10. Do not swim in the lake near the mountain.
11. Do not go into the mountain during curfew.
12. Do not leave town during curfew.

Some of these rules seemed very strange to me, but then again, the town had supposedly been haunted, so I chalked it up to paranoia. I got back in my car and unwrapped a box of fries and a burger I had on the passenger seat. While I was eating, I heard a knock on my car window. I looked up to see what seemed to be a homeless man. He had oily, scraggly hair and a beard that looked like it had been shaven in random patches. He wore a brown jacket, a white shirt and a light blue denim. I rolled down my window slightly and asked him what he wanted.

He said he was hungry and had been walking for hours, and asked if I could share some of my meal. I did so, offering him the remainder of the fries in the box. He thanked me, and I told him to hold on a moment. I took a few ten dollar bills out of my wallet to help him out, but when I had looked back up, he was gone. I stepped out of the car again and looked around to see if I could catch him before he ran off, but there was no sign of him in the parking lot, or anywhere on the nearby road.

I thought he might have been living in the gas station or nearby, so I went looking inside. I found a bunch of old, empty shelves. A rusted image of a once lively place. The door to the storage area was locked, and I am not the person with the type of strength to break it down. There was also no sign of a key anywhere. I thought the homeless man probably had the key, and headed back to my car. Still, I felt uneasy about the interaction. As I've mentioned before, the town was rather small, and I felt the need to get a little exercise. I always enjoyed the night-time, so I grabbed my gear and started the hike towards the mountain. Along the way, I found the girl I'd seen on the highway again. She asked me for something to drink, and I gave her my 
canteen, figuring I could probably refill it at the lake.

She drank the remainder of the water and thanked me. I nodded to her as she handed the canteen back, and went on my way. She stared at me for a little while as I kept walking, but I just smiled politely and continued. When I looked back after walking about a street, she had been gone. She must've walked the other direction. The buildings were pretty in the way, so you couldn't exactly see if someone had turned a corner.

I kept walking, finding my way through the maze of buildings and towards the lake at the base of the mountain, just at the other edge of town. As I knelt down next to it to refill my canteen, I heard a woman with the most angelic voice I had ever heard singing The Sound of Silence. I wondered if it was the woman, but the singing was coming from a direction across the lake that would be pretty hard to access, so I just made a mental note of it, refilled my canteen, and walked to the edge of the nearby dirt road going into the cliffs between the mountain.

During my hike through the pass, I heard laughing from the edges of the cliffs around me. It was creepy, but it almost sounded like hyenas, so I just went about my way, trying to ignore it. I checked the time on my phone and was surprised at how much time had passed. It was already almost 1 AM. I decided to set up camp a little further into the pass and sleep the rest of the night. Luckily, sleep came easily that night, and I was out probably by 2 AM. However, I had the strangest dream that night. I was walking through a forest, and a man in a sheep mask was stalking me through the trees. I knew he was there, I think he knew I knew, and was proud of the fact. He kept cackling, laughing like a hyena. And then he set the trees on fire.

By itself, that's just a random nightmare. I've had a habit of getting those, but I awoke to the smell of smoke, and quickly noticed my tent was on fire. I jumped out of it as soon as I could and went to put out the fire. Only, before I could, he was there. The man in the lamb's mask, tilting his head in the most unnatural way and laughing at me. And then he lunged. I left everything there and then, and booked it. I ran through the town for what felt like hours, back to my car.

He was on my heels the whole time, laughing the night away. I finally made it to my car, heaving and out of breath. I had no idea how I covered that much ground without collapsing, but I did. I quickly got in and locked the doors. Just my luck though, the car wouldn't start. That creep made it to the car, and knocked on my window, whistling in the most eerie tone I had ever heard, all while canting his head to and fro.

I ignored him and kept trying to start the car, and I succeeded just as he smashed his elbow through my window. The glass had hit me, and cut me in several places. I tried to ignore the blood and pain, and floored it out of the parking lot. He hang on for a little while, but I was able to get rid of him by driving a little too close to the tree at the edge of the road out of town.

Near the turn to the highway, the homeless man stood in the middle of the road, arms held wide open like he was inviting me to hit him. I didn't want to stop, I couldn't. I don't know what came over me, but I hit the gas and ran straight into him. There was a loud thud when I did, but when I looked into the rearview mirror, there was no body. No man. Nothing.

I kept going. I turned on the highway, and right there had been the girl in white, hitchhiking. My phone pinged and I ignored it, speeding down the highway. When I felt like I had gotten far enough away, I stopped and checked my phone. One new notification. A text from an unknown number.

"I'm sorry."

I went home and tried to forget the whole incident. Out of curiosity, though, I recently looked up Karetnikov Pass, and found nothing.
