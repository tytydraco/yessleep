Sorry for my english, im using Google translate

Recently (a little over a year) I moved to an apartment that I bought. I bought the apartment in 2022, in January, but it wasn't until April that I was able to move because I had some works and repairs to do in the apartment. 

I must say a few things about the previous owner. The man had a wife and an adopted daughter, he lived with his family since 2019 in a house in a private neighborhood and in no way wanted to leave there, there was no way to mediate the payment at an intermediate point, I had to go to his residence, which was a bit far, with all the money (with all the risks that this implied, but luckily everything was fine). 

Another striking thing (good for me, of course) is that, the man, he sold the apartment at a price that was somewhat lower than the price it should be worth and I lower it even more, I ended up paying for the apartment much cheaper than the market value (according to the m2/$ of the location). 

Where am I going with this?  It seemed that the man had a certain urgency in wanting to sell the house and the fact of his tremendous tenacity in not wanting to leave his private neighborhood... and certain subtle forms of his behavior (which I cannot explain now), led me to think that maybe the man was up to something weird, idk. 

What scared me a lot was when I physically moved there in April after the repairs in the apartment. I had not told almost anyone that I was moving specifically at that time in April (now you will understand later why I tell you this), only a handful of no more than 10 people among close friends and family would be aware of this (of course , neither the previous owner nor the professionals involved in the purchase were aware of this, since my personal move there is something completely personal).

And even the purchase of my new apartment, among friends, family and the few professionals involved in the purchase, there would not be more than 30 people who would be aware, I do not use social networks nor am I a super sociable person. In short, hardly anyone knew what day I was moving, except for my closest relatives. 

The issue is that the day after my exhaustive move, the doorbell rings early in the morning, there is a camera to see who it is but the person had positioned himself so that couldn't be seen, he was standing next to the camera. It was a so-called lawyer who asked me if I was (let's say) Alex, the previous owner of the house. 

I told him that he no longer live here. He told me that it was something that had to do with the property, that there was a legal problem with it or something like that and that I should tell Alex, the lawyer was assuming that I was renting the apartment to Alex (or at least, that was the alibi for me to interest and give him information); and so I told him that I was the new owner. In hindsight I think I shouldn't have told him that, giving him information about me. 

I asked him what it was, that as the new owner i wanted to know but he told me that he couldn't tell me anything. I asked him if it was the first time he had come to the apartment and he said yes (this was very interesting for me since the taming was incredible, I had been living in the house for less than 12 hours and, as I said, almost nobody knew from my moving). 

I asked him for his information, I told him to tell me his identification number as a lawyer, to which he refused, which I thought was very impolite. His tone changed. He told me that if I went down he would show me his registration number. I told him even more surprised that what was the point of not wanting to tell me his registration number through the electric doorman, but if he did tell me if I went down in person? It seemed to me a somewhat childish attitude at the same time as threatening, I started to get scared. 

He only told me his supposed first and last name, let's say his name was Charles Rodriguez, and his buffet (let's say), Lake Buffet from a specific location...

I was very worried after this. If it was real, I was worried that there was a problem with the property. And if not, that it was some stalker since it could not be a coincidence that the doorbell rang just the day after I moved, and not just any one, since, as I said, almost nobody knew about my move; apart from handling the language of legal issues well, in addition to also knowing some facts about Alex well. According to psychology, moving can be a bit traumatic and this really didn't help me feel very safe at home. 

I did my research: 

I spoke severely with my notary (who was the notary of the sell) about the situation and he perjured me that he had done an extensive investigation on the property and that everything was legal, even so, he took note of what I told him and investigated again (weeks later he returned to me to insist that everything was fine). 

I also called the only "Lake Buffet" in the town who told me: I was attended by a lawyer from the buffet and I told him very briefly about my situation (of course, without giving my personal information), the man was naturally confused by a stranger who calls with a similar situation without giving his information, he did not want to give me much of his personal information either, even so he was a kind person and we stayed talking for a while.

He assured me that no Charles Rodriguez worked or had ever worked there, he also told me that a lawyer is never going to give a notice (at least in our country is like that), that this is done at most via mail or a police officer, that the situation was strange. 

Lastly, I spoke to Alex about the situation (I was supposed to notify him), his very serene reaction was "he was just a stalker" (what, to me, wasn't something very serene), it was really very concise, I told him that the man knew information about him... he didn't seem to care, It seemed like a normal situation for him at the same time that he didn't want me to get into his stuff. 

I told him that if he was a harasser then I was going to find out in depth about the matter, because otherwise I couldn't be calm but he urged me to please not get involved in his things (what things? if he was supposedly someone who harassed me and he had nothing to do with it?), that it was better for me not to get involved and to let it go... 

Since then more than a year has passed, nothing else has happened and this is now a memory, but it still mortifies me I hardly remember this anecdote that is not that old... 

My conclusion, putting it all together, is that Alex has been involved with some mafia or wrong person or something like that, and I was simply a temporary and secondary actor in the story...

What do you think?
