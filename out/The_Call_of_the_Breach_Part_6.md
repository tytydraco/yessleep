*Knock, knock, knock.*

“Lieutenant?”

I looked up from the mournful red glow of the embers within the little stove that heated my tent and saw Lucille’s scarlet head poked through the door flap. “You don’t have to call me that when it’s just us, Lucille. Come on in. I’m not really doing much anyway.”

In truth, I’d been doing my best to keep busy in the hours since the trial. I’d sat up with Jamie for a while afterward, only leaving once she promised to try and sleep in preparation for tomorrow. Chris hadn’t said much, and I knew he already blamed himself for failing to get Jamie acquitted, despite the fact that we both knew who really was to blame. As the crowds dispersed, pacified enough that Sean no longer vexed over a potential revolt, Chris and I parted ways while I trudged back to the row of green army surplus tents assigned to my platoon. I’d checked on Lucille, got a supply report from Charlie, and retired to my personal tent, the one luxury afforded to an officer in the Rangers.

Meant to be semi-permanent until better cabins could be built to house all the New Wilderness refugees, my tent was spacious, about ten foot by ten foot square, with heavy green canvas walls, wooden support poles, and a plank floor. The Workers had outdone themselves in turning the old army gear into improved shelters for our people, adding doorframes and crude doors where the tent flaps would have been, installing miniature woodstoves in each fashioned from scrap metal, and they’d even knocked together a little pine desk for me from pallet wood. Still, it was nowhere near the lavish furnishings of the now decimated Elk Lodge at New Wilderness, as the rigid cot under my back reminded me with every toss and turn.

Settling down beside me on the wooden footlocker that held my few belongings, Lucille wrapped both arms around her skinny frame and let out a weary sigh. “I’m sorry about Captain Lansen.”

I shrugged, my eyes back on the glowing coals within the little metal stove and poked a stick through the open fire door to stir them. “What’s done is done.”

She nodded, looked back down at her hands, and shifted on the footlocker lid. “Permission to speak freely?”

*She’s really trying hard to fit the whole soldier persona. Too bad the uniform makes her look so small. Was I that awkward when I first showed up?*

At that, I let slide what could roughly pass as a smile and shook my head. “You don’t need to do all that, not for this.”

“Oh, right.” Lucille drew in a breath, and her fingers tugged at a frayed spot on her jacket cuff in idle thought. “I just . . . can’t we do something? I mean, we could smuggle her out with our trucks tomorrow, maybe drop her off in that old brick factory we found, and then—”

“We can’t interfere in the sentence.” I swallowed hard, and tried not to look at Lucille, so she wouldn’t see me blinking back my own frustration. “Officers can’t break the law, no matter who they are. If I help her, then I put myself and Chris at risk.”

Her face tightened into a confused frown. “But you’re special. No one else here is . . . no one else ever survived what you did. They have to listen to you.”

*That’s not how the world works.*

I laughed, a cold, cynical chuckle, and tossed another hickory stick into the fire. “Just because I threw up splinters and lived doesn’t mean I have the power to overturn our entire government.”

Folding her arms, Lucille scowled at the fire. “Then why did Sean make you an officer?”

“Lucille . . .” I started, but she was already on a roll.

“It’s so stupid! You have power, you have Major Dekker on your side, there are twenty-five of us ready to do whatever you say, but you can’t do anything because of some dumb law.” She waved her arms dramatically, her face flushed a similar shade to her crimson locks. “What good is being in charge if you can’t do what you want?”

There I saw the truth in her downcast face, how she lowered her voice to a whisper as she examined her own fingers in distraction. This wasn’t solely about Jamie, I knew it; this was about her sister, the only family Lucille had left in this twisted world. Andrea Campbell had taken up a rifle against the mutants in the early days of the outbreak and turned around at the last possible moment to distract ELSAR guardsmen while Lucille, myself, and dozens of others from Black Oak slipped through a gap in the perimeter wall to freedom. We had no idea what became of her, but not a day went by that Lucille didn’t worry.

*My family may as well be on Mars for how far away we are, but she has hope. Poor kid. If my mom or dad were somewhere in Black Oak, I’d drive myself crazy trying to find them.*

I faced her, and caught Lucille’s gaze. “Being a leader isn’t about getting what you want; it’s about sacrificing for the good of others. Andrea knew that, and Chris does too, otherwise he’d be the first one out there fighting to keep Jamie safe.”

Lucille’s angry expression lightened somewhat at that, and she kicked at the canvas floor with her boot. “But she’s one of us. Andrea would say she’s family. Why can’t we make exceptions for that?”

Ethan’s conversation with me in the motor pool returned to mind, and I picked up another chunk of wood to throw into the fire, watching the yellow flames dance to life. “Humans aren’t rational creatures, not when they’re angry, afraid, or grieving. The only reason they ever acted logical in the first place is because powerful men like Sean, Chris, or Adam kept them from going insane. If Jamie wasn’t found guilty, we’d be fighting an uprising, and she could have been shot, or even hanged by the mob. As crazy as it sounds, by sending her away, we’re doing the best we can to save Jamie’s life, along with hundreds more.”

Her shoulders fell, and Lucille hung her head. “I guess so. It just doesn’t seem fair.”

“Politics rarely is.” I sighed, my mental drain returning, and rubbed my face with one hand. It seemed this day had dragged on forever, and yet I knew I wouldn’t sleep well if I lay down. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Jamie’s ashen face as the guards led her away, felt Vecitorak’s knife in my ribs all over again, and imagined how awful it would be if he caught her.

Boots thudded on the boardwalk outside, and a muffled voice called through my doorframe. “Hannah?”

*Chris.*

Throwing me a knowing look, Lucille rose to her feet and made a quick salute. “I better go get some rest.”

“You don’t have to—” I started to protest, but the girl cut me off with an ornery wink and as the door opened, she slipped past Chris on the way out with another brief salute in his direction.

Pulling the door shut behind him, Chris locked eyes with me, his face drawn and solemn. “I . . . um . . . there’s dinner, in my room.”

My stomach squirmed in vicious knots, and I shook my head. “I’m not hungry.”

His lips twitched into a disappointed, if unsurprised half smile. “Not hungry, or not interested?”

*Wake up Hannah, he’s flirting with you.*

Realizing my mistake, I pressed a palm to my forehead in humiliation. “Sorry, I . . . it’s just been a long day.”

Chris strode over to sit on the footlocker beside me, resting both elbows on his knees. “Maybe you should stay then. Get some shut eye. Tomorrow’s going to be busy.”

I bit my lip at myself and climbed to my feet to grab my jacket. “I didn’t mean that as a *no*.”

“And I didn’t mean it as an order.” He cocked his head to one side, studying me as I moved with a weary sigh.

“You went through the trouble to find some food.” I jammed my boots on one by one in a clumsy hop. “It’s not like I’m going to sleep much anyway.”

“Maybe not by yourself.”

*Wait . . . what?*

I froze mid hop, one boot on, and spun my head around to stare at him. Now? Of all times, of all nights, was he finally inviting me into his bed *now*? Even if we had been in a place where I felt confident enough to get naked around him, there was no way I could summon enough will do feel sexy when Jamie faced exile. How on earth could he not see that?

“It doesn’t have to be anything you don’t want it to be.” Reading my mind, Chris held up a hand to stop my frantic thoughts. “Tomorrow is going to be tough on us both, and we’re not going to get much time together once the offensive kicks off. I don’t expect anything, Hannah, it’s just . . . I don’t want to be alone tonight. *Please*.”

At that last word, his voice tinged with emotion, and Chris’s eyes begged me in a hurt, broken way I hadn’t often seen. He didn’t get overly emotional, even in the face of horrendous things, and for Chris to plead with me, it had to be bad. He was in pain, I could see it, and that was enough to rouse a sense of sympathy within me, a deep need to feel something other than agony from my own rash choices.

“Okay.” I wrapped him in a quick hug, and then sped around the room to collect what I needed for the night. “I’ll just get some things, and we’ll go. Two seconds.”

We walked to the mechanical shed, and climbed to his office, where a fire waited in the grate, along with a pot of soup he bargained from the market. I’d already scrubbed myself down earlier at the communal bathhouse and changed into some lighter shorts behind a curtain in the corner of the room. It was warmer here, the building holding the heat of the fireplace better than my tent, and it smelled of chicken broth from the soup, a pleasant ambience that soothed my wounded nerves.

Pulling a brush through my hair, I tried not to think about the fact that I’d borrowed it from Jamie, or how she would have winced at the knowledge of what I was about to do. She’d loved Chris before I ever came to Barron County, loved him and lost him, and a small part of that would never heal. I never pressed Chris on how far he and Jamie had gone; it wasn’t my business, and besides, I didn’t want to make an already uncomfortable situation worse. However, it did make me nervous, thinking about what Jamie, with her beautiful curves and long bleach-blonde hair, would have worn to bed on a night like this.

*Even if we’re not going to do anything, I wouldn’t have minded some advance warning so I could find something in the market sexier than this. This shirt is way too baggy. I look like a homeless—*

Coming around the curtain, I stopped dead in my tracks, and the air stuck in my throat.

Chris stood with his back to me across the room, wearing a pair of polyester black athletic shorts, having just tugged off his own shirt. He clearly hadn’t detected the light footfalls of my sock feet on the rough sawn floor and was busy searching in his own footlocker for a suitable replacement. I’d never seen him shirtless before, and while a tiny part of my brain huffed with annoyance at my own rudeness, the rest of me stared, unable to stop myself.

Lit by the flickering of the surrounding candles, his chiseled torso was a rolling tapestry of muscle, toned and sleek, like something off a men’s fitness magazine. I’d seen him work with the other men before, fought alongside him enough to know his strength, but in this light, it made my head spin. Chris’s skin gleamed, smooth as silk in the light, stretched over mountains of sinew and tendon that could have broken me in half like a twig if he wanted to. Stitched over this, I noted the many scars that marked him in jagged little slices, raised bits of torn skin that had sewn itself back together over time. Some were rather large, one on his right shoulder almost as long as my hand, while others were small, but I had no doubt they’d all hurt when they were new. It reminded me that Chris had spent two weeks in the abyssal nightmare of the forest alone after his helicopter was shot down, and the untold horrors he’d seen were evidenced in his ragged flesh.

Finding a shirt, Chris turned, his eyes focused on his hands, and my muddled brain threatened to go into meltdown over the rest of him. While our borderline starvation rations at New Wilderness had always been a drag, it had certainly done him massive favors, the surface of his stomach flat save for the slight ripples of his abdominal muscles. Both Chris’s arms were taunt with more bulges, and a light coat of curly brown hair covered his broad chest.

*Breathe, come on Hannah, you need to breathe.*

At last, Chris noticed me standing there, and he paused halfway through finding the armholes of his shirt to return my stare. I found myself baffled as his sky-blue eyes traveled the length of my diminutive frame with a hungry glint. On the heels of his devouring gaze, I was suddenly conscious of the air on my legs, how the thin shorts didn’t quite reach my mid-thigh, and that the baggy shirt I’d fretted over wasn’t so baggy as to hide me completely. Sure, I still didn’t feel the wave of confidence needed to hurl myself at him with primal desire, but with how he looked at me in that moment, it seemed as though I was the only girl on earth.

No one had ever looked at me like that.

Heat pooled in my core, static roared in my brain, and my pulse jumped under my skin with adrenaline, as I dared to let my thoughts wander, dared to imagine taking that shirt away from him and . . .

*Rattle, rattle, rattle.*

On the small propane burner at his desk, the stainless-steel cooking pot hissed steam from under its lid, and Chris yanked his shirt on, crossing the space to tend to it. “Soup’s done.”

Sucking in a gasp, I forced my racing heart to slow and padded over to the two stools he had set up for us. I wasn’t hungry but made myself eat anyway, and the delicious combination of starchy noodles, chopped vegetables, and salty chicken helped to untangle the knots in my gut. At the very least, I ended up yawning once or twice before the meal ended, and noticed Chris do the same.

With the soup gone, Chris stoked the fire in the stove and strode to the conversion couch to peel back the covers on the pullout.

Turning to me, he flushed an adorable shade of crimson and cleared his throat. “Ladies first.”

Climbing in, I felt my heart pound in excited, if nervous beats, and let him pull me close as he got in beside me. I’d thought of us together many times before, admittedly with more than some innocent cuddling going on in my mind, but with how awful today had been, this was a welcome reprieve. He smelled of the same kind of homemade soap everyone used at the fort, a slightly oaky scent due to the wood vats used to make it. The gray cotton shirt he wore was soft against my skin, and I felt shivers of pleasant warmth flow through me as we settled down together beneath the blankets.

“You comfy?” He whispered and stroked my hair in a way that turned my mind to mush.

*Comfy doesn’t even come close to what this is.*

“Yeah.” With a contented sigh, I dared to hitch one leg around his waist and relished how it felt to have his body against mine, the two of us as close as the thin material of our garments would let us be.

We lay there in the shadow of the dying candles, and for a while, neither of us spoke. Chris rubbed at my back between the shoulder blades, and I listened to the muffled echo of his heart beating beneath my ear, like a dull tom-tom drum encased with muscle.

“I never understood how it felt for her not to pull the trigger on me.” Chris broke the silence at last, staring up at the ceiling above us with a brooding look. “Never imagined it could be like this. After all that, everything that we went through, the last thing she’ll remember me for is that I failed her.”

Tightening my arms around him, I craned my head back to see his face. “You *defended* her. That’s what she’ll remember. You were loyal, even when it could have cost you everything.”

“A good man protects his own.” Chris sighed bitterly. “I didn’t protect her, just staved off the inevitable. It would have been a mercy to shoot Jamie instead of leaving her to starve, or freeze, or—”

Unable to bear the despair in his voice I climbed over him and took his face in my hands to bring our lips together. It sent delicious lightning through my blood, but I pushed the primal urge away to focus on caressing his mouth with mine, telling him how much I loved him, needed him, believed in him, without any words. I tasted the salt of tears, knew they were his, and tightened all four limbs around him with iron certainty. I slid my fingers through his soft, mousy hair, gripped his waist with my legs, and poured my broken heart into every motion, even as hot droplets slid down my own face. He hadn’t betrayed Jamie . . . I had. He hadn’t let her down, *I* had. I’d stolen her life, her love, her chance at freedom, and I would be damned if I let him suffer for it.

*How does it hurt more when the tears are his?*

When the kiss ended, I rested my forehead against his, and looked down into Chris’s eyes, sky blue seas of sorrow that made my heart twinge in guilt. “*I* did this. Not you. The blood is on my hands.”

Circled around me in a wall of silk-coated iron, his arms kept me pressed to his chest, and Chris swallowed hard, blinking at his internal misgivings. “I don’t want you to bear that burden alone.”

“You’ve borne it enough.” Wiping at the remnants of his rare tears, I shook my head, the long rivulets of my brown hair falling around our faces in a shroud, the golden streaks highlighted like stars in the candlelight. “More than enough. This place, these people, they need you, Chris. You can’t just give up now that we’re so close to the end.”

He ran a gentle set of fingers through my tangled locks, and I couldn’t help but shiver in delight at how good it felt. “They need *us*. You have a longer shadow than you realize, Hannah. The resistance in Black Oak, the missile silo, all of that happened because of you. I’m Head Ranger because of *you*. The thing that scares me now, the part that I dread more than anything, is the possibility that once of these days I might lose you too.”

*He's scared. God, that’s terrifying. I’ve never seen him like this before.*

“I’m not going anywhere.” I stubbornly shook my head, but he simply raised one brown eyebrow at me.

“You didn’t plan on getting stabbed by Vecitorak either. He’s still out there, ELSAR still has three times our number, and the Breach is still growing in strength. Thousands are going to die in this war, and if one of us doesn’t come back . . .”

“Then you leave.” I forced the words from myself, determined not to envision a future without him, even if it meant seeing the opposite; one where he had to live on in my absence. “You can slip across the border, go to your house in Pennsylvania, maybe get your old job back. If this place goes under, if I’m gone, why stay?”

Chris glared at me, not with anger so much as despair at the potential misfortune he’d envisioned. “We all go home, or no one does.”

I recognized the words Jamie had spoken on Maple Lake, knew they meant more to both Chris and I than either of us could express. Despite my wish to see him safe, to see him happy, to spare the man I loved from a war that could take everything he had left away, I couldn’t fight him on that.

*As long as you’re here, it’s home.*

Sliding onto the bed by his side, I nestled my head in the nape of his neck, and watched a nearby candle fizzle out. “Then we win this, together. You and me. For Jamie’s sake.”

Chris didn’t reply, but with how he rolled onto his side to crush me against his chest again, cradled me in his arms, I knew it was a *yes*. The fire crackled, the candles slowly burnt out, but even as the room fell into cozy shadows, I found myself wide awake in Chris’s arms. Our offensive was in two days, tomorrow for prep, the next day for launch. Countless deaths would likely result, and I wondered how many of the teenagers in my platoon would be part of that number. What would I do if Lucille was killed? What would I tell Andrea? How would I live with myself if all the people I loved and respected were consumed by the ugly maw of this conflict? What would I do if, in the end, I was left all alone in the woods, with only the dead and the Breach to keep me company?

Burying my face in his shirt, I screwed my eyes shut and tried not to think about it as the hands on Chris’s watch slowly counted down to morning.
