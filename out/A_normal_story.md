Now I will tell you a story about a boy who needed money, he got a job taking care of a room in the woods, a place where sunlight does not reach, when the boy arrived, the sign at the entrance only said "factory" when he went When asking about work, a lady with purple eyes and messy hair told her: sure, I'll go to the second floor and wait for Alfred. "Are you the new employee" asked a voice behind him, when he turned he saw a man in a suit, with wild hair and unibrow. "You start today" he said as he took out a contract, the boy signed it and Alfred gave him a folder with the things to do and what not to do before leaving. "They really will pay me to spend the night in a room, I like this job" said the boy without imagining what would happen. the rules were:

-Close the door of the room at 8 at night and for no reason leave until 6 in the morning.

-No one can use Hank's computer, NO ONE

-don't let the concierge in, we don't have

-If the trash can moves, put it in its place as soon as possible

The boy stopped reading the rules because he thought they were trying to play a joke on him, but after a while the garbage can moved, he put it in its place as quickly as possible, right after the janitor knocked on the door, but he didn't. I let in. what kind of site is this? the boy wondered, grabbing the folder again to read the rules he hadn't seen.

-If I, Alfred, knock on the door and tell you to open it, don't open it until I tell you the password.

-If someone who is not the janitor, let him in, but do not speak to him

-after 10 pm do not call me on the phone.

"If I follow the rules nothing bad will happen to me" said the naive boy. Suddenly, a girl knocked on the door, the boy let her in, the girl asked and asked but the boy did not speak to her or look at her, when he looked at her he saw a horrible face, sharp teeth and completely black eyes, luckily for him just left. then Alfred arrived, the boy asked him for the password and Alfred replied: "haha, we don't have a password, it's a trick in case someone wants to pretend to be me", the boy let him in, and saw that Alfred began to use the computer from hank, so desperate he got under the table and reviewed the rules, and something that froze him was that behind the folder it said: "the password is lemonade" so the boy quickly called alfred on the phone. so the boy explained the situation to alfred, so he had to act normal so he wouldn't suspect him while the real alfred arrived, after a long time with the fake alfred, just when he was going to catch him, alfred arrived and gave him a blow from behind that leaves him K.O.
When the boy was going to call his wife that he wasn't going to finish the job anyway, he realized that it was 11 at night, the boy ran out, no more was heard from him.
