Hello Nosleep. I have news to tell! After I posted my report about the disturbing events of the fateful archaeological excavation we took part in, https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/rZP6Nu5WxZ,  Sarah wrote me an email . That's how we got in touch again. She allowed me to share the following with you.

The subject line was simple: "Urgent - You need to see this." To tell more about her, she's an anthropologist and her research is focused on ancient Peruvian cultures, specifically on the Moche. She was always been fascinated by their intricate ceramics, particularly the ones depicting scenes of everyday life, war, and… well, the odd, sometimes sexually explicit images.

She told me of a special piece of extremely graphic Moche pottery. A Moche vase, its surface painted with a scene of skeletal figures dancing in a frenzied, almost chaotic circle. The figures were rendered in abstract detail, their bones articulated with a disturbing sense of being animated. The paint was vibrant, almost luminous, and seemed to pulsate with a kind of strange energy.

As she stared at the image, a shiver ran down her spine. It wasn't just the unsettling nature of the subject matter that unnerved her; it was a feeling, an inexplicable sensation, that something was wrong, deeply wrong. She told me of a subtle shift in the air, a tightening in her chest, as if a malevolent presence had entered the room.

Here are some quotes from her email that detail how she came about the vase.

“I’ve been working late at the museum," she wrote, "and I just can’t shake the feeling that something's wrong. I’ve been researching  how and why the Moche sometimes, in contrast to their usual ways, mummified their dead and came across this vase in storage. It’s been untouched for years, and I swear it wasn’t there before. The images on it… they're unsettling. There’s a rhythm to them, a strange chant that seems to echo in my head even when I’m not looking at it."

The email ended abruptly, leaving me feeling even more uneasy. Sarah’s usual academic composure had been replaced with a raw fear that mirrored my own. I had a sudden urge to contact her, to tell her to leave the museum, to stay away from the vase. But I hesitated. I knew Sarah, knew her thirst for knowledge, her unwavering commitment to her research. I couldn’t imagine her leaving something like this unfinished, despite of her knowing about my own experiences.

Over the next few days, she wrote me again and told me that the image of the dancing skeletons would be haunted her dreams. She found herself replaying the scene over and over in her mind, trying to decipher its meaning. The figures seemed to writhe and twist in an impossibly unnatural way, their long, bony fingers reaching out as if grasping for something beyond the confines of the vase.

Finally, I decided to visit Sarah at the museum. I needed to see the vase for myself, to understand what had gripped her with such terror. The museum was quiet, the air thick with the scent of dust and old paper. I found Sarah in a dimly lit storage room, hunched over a notebook, her face pale and drawn. She looked up as I entered, a flicker of relief passing across her features.

“You came,” she said, her voice strained. “I’m glad. You need to see this… to understand.”

She gestured to the vase, which sat on a pedestal in the center of the room. It was even more disturbing in person, the skeletal dancers seemingly alive in the dim light.

I took a step closer, and as I did, a low hum filled the room, like a distant chant. I looked at Sarah, her face contorted in a mask of terror. "What is that sound?" I whispered, my voice barely audible over the pulsing rhythm.

"It… it's the vase," she stammered, her eyes wide with fear. "The figures, they're moving. It's not possible, but they're moving, and I can hear the chant, the lyrics..."

She began to recite, her voice trembling, her words as strange and unsettling as the image on the vase:

"Bones of the dead, bones of the strong, Dance to the rhythm, all night long. The earth gives life, the earth takes back, We dance in the darkness, on the skeletal track. Flesh of the living, bones we crave, A ritual of love, in the bony grave. Bone to bone, flesh to bone, The rhythm of the dead, we alone know. 

In the twilight’s grasp, where shadows blend,
Aiapaec whispers, our bodies ascend.
With decapitating love, under moon’s soft veil,
Skulls entwined in passion, where the living pale.

Bone on bone, in the dance of despair,
Echoes of the ancients, are we flesh or air?
Enigmatic caress, as the sinews unwind,
In the crypt’s warm embrace, our fates intertwined.

Rituals of the night, shrouded in mystery,
Fractured limbs entwined, writing history.
Flesh rots while we revel, in a carnal repose,
Seductive and vicious, where only darkness grows.

Bone on bone, in the dance of despair,
Echoes of the ancients, are we flesh or air?
Enigmatic caress, as the sinews unwind,
In the crypt’s warm embrace, our fates intertwined.

From the altar of desire, the skeletal surround,
Aiapaec guides our passions in the underground.
Mouths wide with hunger, where the dead do feast,
Amongst the ashes and dust, we commune with the beast.

Vividly we writhe, in this timeless dark,
Each thrust a sacrament, igniting the spark.
Through the hollow sockets, our souls interlace,
Eternal entangling, in the skeletal embrace.

Bone on bone, in the dance of despair,
Echoes of the ancients, are we flesh or air?
Enigmatic caress, as the sinews unwind,
In the crypt’s warm embrace, our fates intertwined.

As Aiapaec watches with a lover’s grin,
We plunge into chaos, where the end begins.
In the realm of the eerie, where flesh meets decay,
We spiral in ecstasy, in a dance of dismay."

As Sarah spoke, the hum in the room intensified, the skeletal figures on the vase seemed to writhe in a grotesque dance. I felt a cold hand grip my heart, the air around us thickening with an ominous presence. The room was no longer a place of storage, but a haunted chamber, the air thick with the stench of decay and the promise of something truly sinister.

I knew then that Sarah was right. This was no mere artifact; it was a vessel for something ancient and malevolent. Something that had been awakened, something that craved the life it had long been denied.
