After I’m done writing this, I’m going to end my own life.



My hands won’t stop shaking and my thumbs are coated in sweat. I can barely type at this point, and I can’t bear being around those disgusting things any longer, listening to their fleshy clicking and inhaling that putrid scent. But someone needs to know what happened to me. I’m not going to just up and die without a trace.



Below this passage I’ve copied and pasted every entry of the daily journal my therapist told me to write. I don’t care how personal it is, that couldn’t matter less anymore. Damnit. That horrible thing is staring at me through the window again. Staring at me with its eight unblinking human eyes. Is that truly the last thing I’m going to see? God. I just know it’s going to do the awfulest things to my corpse. Except, part of me doesn’t mind.



Day 1



Alright. It’s been a full day since I got here and it’s actually been a lot nicer than I expected. It feels really good to not be judged and looked at 24/7. To be able to go outside, walk around and get some fresh air without feeling like a circus freak. It’s quite peaceful honestly, the gentle breeze, the faint scent of pine and the singsong chirping of the birds. The cabin is cool too I guess. Nice and rustic you know. I feel pretty silly writing this. I’m kind of cringing at myself right now. But this is what my therapist wanted, so I should probably listen to her. Though sometimes I swear her advice doesn’t make sense. But to give credit where it’s due, it does feel good to get my thoughts out. Plus it’s kind of nostalgic. Reminds me of when I was a kid, writing in my diary every night before I went to bed. I remember being really embarrassed about doing that. Not wanting anyone to find out about it. I treated it like some kind of horrible deep dark secret. It’s kind of funny in hindsight. I really miss those days. When my mom would wake me up in the morning and have to practically drag me out of bed. When she would hug me goodbye before school. When me and my friends would stay up till like 2 am while playing minecraft. I really took all that for granted didn’t I? You never truly know how good you have it until your life goes to shit. But you know what. I’m actually feeling pretty optimistic right now. I have a good feeling about this place. Wow. I wrote a lot more than I thought I would.



Day 2



This is super embarrassing to admit, but I’m already feeling the withdrawal of being without technology. I know it’s only my second day here but I can’t help it. I’m honestly a little disappointed in myself. I should be enjoying the beautiful nature around me, not tweaking over my inability to doomscroll. Gosh, why am I like this? At least I still have my phone on me, so I’m not completely without tech. Though there’s not really a signal here, so it’s still pretty useless. Damn. I should have downloaded some movies or something. Whatevs. I’m sure I’ll survive. I just have to stop being such a little fiend. On a different, slightly less embarrassing note, I found this super cool looking stick while walking through the woods. It totally looked like a sword, with a hilt, cross guard and everything. And It also had all these weird looking fuzzy black and blue splotches on it. Though it broke really easily when I started swinging it around. You know now that I’m writing this down I just realized that the stick was probably covered in mold. Wow. I’m really that smart am I? I’m not going to get sick because of that, am I? I’m not exactly a mold expert so I wouldn’t know. I should probably stop writing before I make myself look even stupider than I already am. Not that anyone is actually seeing this. Unless of course my phone is hacked and being spied on or something. That would suck. Okay I’m going to bed. Hopefully I won’t metamorphosize into a horrific mold monster overnight.



Day 3



I saw a spider today while walking through the woods. Like a really big disgusting spider. I don’t even have arachnophobia, I just find them super icky and grody. Bleh. I mean It’s fine I guess. I crushed it with a rock. Hopefully I won’t see any others. I’m going to try to not let it get to me, but I feel a little freaked out to be honest. I think I’ll try drawing something tomorrow. Hopefully that will take my mind off of it.



Day 4



Today was really really nice. I sat on the beach of this nearby lake. The sun felt so good on my skin and looked so very beautiful shimmering on the lake, dancing across the water like a parade of glowing fairies. I must have sat there for hours, drawing on my sketch book with the water gently lapping at my feet. At one point, I even saw a group of otters playing with each other. I could hear them chirping together. It was all so adorable. I waved at them, and it could have been my imagination, but I swear one of them waved back. Something about that just made me really happy.



You know, I didn’t end up finishing any of my drawings. I just sort of went from page to page, drawing random stupid ideas. A cartoony mushroom dude fighting a knight on one page, a cat with a machine gun on another. None of it was particularly well drawn. In fact, most of it looked pretty shitty. But that doesn’t bother me. I had a good time, and that’s all that matters. Because life is ultimately about enjoying yourself, right? And for the first time in a while, I enjoyed myself. 



Day 5



It rained pretty heavily today, which kind of caught me off guard since the weather was so clear yesterday. At first I was completely bummed out and not looking forward to spending an entire day farting around my cabin doing nothing. But after a few hours I just decided to go outside anyway in my swim shorts. Awful idea. I think I stayed outside for a grand total of five minutes before getting hypothermia and rushing back in. Not my proudest moment. Anyway, the rest of the day really wasn’t as bad as I originally thought it would be. I took it as an opportunity to do some writing. I’ve had this idea for a short story in the back of my mind for a while now, and I finally wrote the first few pages of it. I honestly feel super good about it. I could’ve just spent the entire day in bed doing nothing, like I usually do, but I didn’t. I made the most out of an undesirable situation, and as silly as it might sound, I’m quite proud of myself.



On another note, I really like the sound the rain makes on the cabin roof. It’s quite calming. Makes me feel all cozy and warm. If only I had a cup of tea and a good book, then I’d really be living the dream. I bet It’ll be nice to fall asleep to. I swear I hear something else though. Like a faint whistling or humming or something, mixed with the rain sounds. Nah, I’m probably just going coocoo.



Day 6



I saw another spider. Still really big and disgusting like the last one. Whatever. I grinded it up with a stick. I’m still going to try to have a decent time out here, but it’s kind of hard to with the thought of spiders in the back of my mind.



Day 7



For an ever so brief moment, right before I fell asleep, on the cusp of unconsciousness, that memory played through my mind again. I was a kid again in my childhood bedroom, and everything was real. There was the quiet pitter patter of rain against my window. I was tucked in underneath my fluffy white blanket that had pictures of Snoopy the dog on it and I was hugging my small pink teddy bear which was named Chappy. I was thinking about a sleepover I was about to have with my friends. We were going to have a water gun fight and build a pillowfort, and stay up all night.

It felt so real. So incredibly real.



I really do miss that. Damn it. I can’t stop thinking about it now. I’ve been crying so much. 



Day 8



I lay in bed all day. I just couldn’t bring myself to get up. I kind of wish I was back home right now. 



I keep on thinking about my life. How much better it would be right now if that man hadn’t driven into me. Everything was going so well. 



And then bam! Ruined in one single impact. It’s not fair. 



How can everyone be so unfair? I see the way they look at me. The way they cross the street when they see me walking towards them. I get it, my face is fucked up. But have some goddamn empathy. I can’t get a job or a girlfriend or even just a regular fucking friend. If people weren’t so unfair to judge me off of my appearance. And if that guy hadn’t hit me. I can only imagine where my life would be right now.



Day 9



I saw like five different spiders while walking through the forest. All really big and nasty. This is ridiculous. My therapist told me that this place would be relaxing, that it would hopefully give me a new perspective on things. And you know what? I was actually having a pretty good time. But nooo, of course these gross ass spiders need to show up and ruin everything. God. Why did I even trust her in the first place? She doesn’t know what’s best for me. I think I’m done with therapy after this.



 I don’t want to be here anymore. I’ll probably go home tomorrow.



Day 10



I’ve been carrying around a nice long sturdy stick with me. Real good for whacking things. Real good for smashing those disgusting spiders. I really don’t know why there’s so many all of a sudden. I didn’t see any when I first got here. And now I saw at least ten today. That’s right, ten! It might also just be my imagination, but I feel like they’re a lot bigger than before. Like seriously I swear I saw one that was like a fully blown tarantula. All hairy and everything. It made me sick just looking at it. It was pretty satisfying to smoosh though. I’ll go home tomorrow.



Day 11



I lay in bed again. Doing nothing. I’ll go home tomorrow.



Day 12



I’ll go home tomorrow. For real this time



Day 13



This is really really terrible. There’s got to be at least a dozen spiders in the back of my car! Each of them massive as shit. No way in hell am I going into that car. Like genuinly what the actual fuck is going on. Why is this happening to me? Why is it always me? What did I do to deserve this? I can’t go home now even if I wanted to. This can’t be normal. The universe itself has to be targeting me. Why me? Why the fuck are you targetting me! Target someone else you stupid piece of shit!



Day 14



I’ve been walking around the forest with my stick. Crushing every spider I see. Those disgusting, hideous things. The way they sort of deflate like a balloon, when I smoosh them, it’s really satisfying, but also gross as shit. They’re getting bigger too. I swear to god they’re getting bigger. And there’s way more of them as well. I feel nauseous just being here. I swear I saw one that was bigger than my hand. I threw a large rock at it from a distance, and it scuttled off on its spindly little legs. I gagged when it did that.



Day 15



I’m one hundred percent certain now. If there was any doubt in my mind it’s gone now. The universe itself is targeting me. That’s the only way. I saw a spider that had to have been over a foot long. Just sitting there on a tree. Unmoving. That has to be some kind of world record or something. It was just so disturbing. I felt my heart drop to my stomach when I saw it. I made sure to kill it. Though it didn’t instantly die when I hit it with my stick. It fell to the ground, all curled up in a ball, each of its hairy eight legs still twitching. I slowly crushed its legs one by one with my stick. I almost vomited while doing it.



Day 16



I swear I’m not crazy, but I saw a spider that must have been bigger than my head. Way bigger. Like almost three feet long. I swear I’m not crazy. It scuttled across the forest floor a few meters in front of me. I ran back to my cabin as fast as I could. What the fuck do I do. How is this happening? Why is this happening? Why can’t the universe just let me exist? Why does my life always have to be ruined?



Day 17



I curled up in a ball and cried for the whole day.



Day 18



The more I think about it the more it makes my blood boil. The accident didn’t have to mean anything. I’m still perfectly healthy, it’s just my face that got ruined. But that shouldn’t mean anything. Why do people care if my face isn’t conventionally normal? I’m still a normal person other than that. It’s completely ridiculous that people can be that shallow. Appearances shouldn’t matter that much. To think that people have the nerve to think less of me just because of my outside body. It’s their fault my life is in ruins, along with that idiot driver. And of course my shitty therapist suggests that I go out here. Well guess what, now I’m stuck in the middle of some unnatural freak event. I guess it’s just one last fuck you from the universe to me. Well fuck you too!



Day 19



I tried going outside, and every single tree I saw had one of those disgusting monsters sitting on its trunk. Each of them was at least as big as a foot. I’m going to die here aren’t I? Those hideous freaks of nature. They are an abomination. A pox upon this world. And I’m surrounded by god knows how many. At least I haven’t seen any inside my cabin, but I don’t know how long that’s going to last.



Day 20



I had a nightmare about it. The spiders. I dreamt about being wrapped up in their webs. I couldn’t move, I could only watch as they crawled all over me. Some of the smaller ones would crawl into my mouth. I tried to chew as many as I could, but some got through, scuttling down my throat. I could feel them lay their spider eggs in my stomach. Then I could feel the eggs hatch. Thousands of spiders birthed inside of me. I could see them crawling under my skin, eating me from the inside out. I woke up drenched in more sweat then I thought possible. I didn’t shower. I fear that the spiders are going to shoot out of my shower nozzle. That they’re going to crawl out of the drain and devour me while I’m naked.



Day 21



I stopped using the toilet. I can just tell that a spider is going to crawl up through it. That it’s going to crawl up my asshole. I looked out my window and there was at least double the amount of spiders as last time. I spotted the one I saw a few days ago. The one that was three feet long. It was staring back at me with its front legs raised in the air, swaying back and forth, as if it were waving at me.



Day 22



The smell is unbearable. The smell of shit and piss. My shit and piss. I’ve vomited three times already. I don’t bother cleaning it up. What difference does it make? I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I can hear the spiders from outside. They’re making a fleshy clicking sound. They’re mocking me. Telling me to come outside. I’ve thought about it. Thought about going out and killing as many as I can before they eat me alive.



Day 23



I looked outside again. There’s at least one spider for every square foot. None of them are moving, they’re just sitting there, clicking. I can tell they’re looking at me. The smell is getting worse.



Day 24



What I don’t understand is why they don’t just kill me. I haven’t seen any in my cabin yet. Maybe they’re just playing with their food. At night I can hear other sounds. Not just the clicking. No. There’s something else. It’s faint, but no doubt there. It sounds like a woman singing.



Day 25



I can hear footsteps outside my cabin. Several footsteps all at the same time. Like eight legs all walking at once. It must be the size of a person. I’m considering killing myself, to possibly avoid a fate worse than death.



Day 26



I saw it walk by my window. It was at least five feet tall. That’s right. Tall. It was furry, and gray. I only got a brief glimpse, but the image will forever be scarred into my mind.



Day 27



The sun didn’t come up today. It just remained dark. So very dark. A never ending night time. The sky is a wall of black sickly clouds. Stagnant clouds hanging far too low to the ground. The average skyscraper could probably reach them. It’s suffocating. Like the universe is trying to smother me in bed with a pillow.



Day 28



The sun is still gone. The clouds are still hanging over me, closer to the ground than yesterday. It’s darker. Everything is darker. Though maybe that’s for the best since the darkness hides most of the spiders outside my cabin. I can only see the close ones. Of course, that doesn’t really matter. I can still hear all their clicking. I can still tell that there must be thousands. And I can still hear the thumping footsteps from the human sized one. God. I hope someone else finds this place. It only seems fair that I’m not the only one who went through this.



Day 29



It’s my therapist’s fault that I’m out here. She condemned me to this. My shitty therapist who’s only ever given me bad advice. Who tells me things that I don’t even understand. She never cared for me. Of course she hasn’t. She only pretends to care because it's her job. What a joke. And then, it's the people who make me feel like a freak’s fault that I had to get a therapist. The people who judge me for my looks. The people who see me as a hideous monster. And then it’s that idiot drunk driver’s fault that my face looks the way it is.



Day 30



The front door to the cabin fell off its hinges. I don’t know why, it just did. The spiders have their perfect opportunity to kill me, and yet I still see them waiting. Each of them, sitting absolutely still, making their awful clicking. I got a better look at the massive spider. It walked across the open doorway. It was really muscular, and its legs were really veiny. I threw up at the sight of it. Yet something about it was so alluring.



Day 31



The singing has gotten a lot louder now. I hate listening to it. It makes me furious. I want to kill whoever is singing. Make them suffer like me.



Day 32



There’s a strange chilled blue mist in the air. It’s extremely thick and combined with the darkness I can barely see anything. I can kind of taste the mist in the air. It’s pretty sweet, like blue raspberry candy. It has a pretty disgusting aftertaste though. But that’s probably the shit and piss particles in the air from my uncleaned shit and piss. There’s also these shiny little yellow thingies floating around. They look like golden snowflakes, but are hot to the touch. I can hear the singing very clearly now. Whoever is doing it must be right outside my cabin, but I can’t see them though. The lyrics are complete gibberish. It’s like she’s singing in a different language, except I’ve never heard any language that sounds even remotely similar to that. However, I can strangely still understand parts of it. Not the words themselves, but the message behind them. I think she’s telling me to come outside. Telling me that she knows what’s best for me. Does she think I’m an idiot? Well actually, Part of me does want to go outside. Go outside and kill her. Put an end to that annoying singing. I know, I know, the spiders would probably eat me, but I feel like I could definitely kill her before they finish me off. I’m feeling rather sleepy though. I’ll kill her tomorrow, hopefully she'll still be close to my cabin by then.



Day 33



I had a dream that I was torturing that drunk driver. He was chained down to a chair. I peeled the skin off his face. It was so wet and satisfying. And then, all of a sudden, I was the drunk driver. I was chained down to the chair, and I was being tortured by me. When I awoke I had cum more than I ever had before. 



The singing is gone… I missed my opportunity. It’s been replaced by faint echoes of moaning. Yes I see what’s going on. They’re having sex in the forest.



Day 34



I woke up in the middle of the night, and the massive spider was watching me through the cabin window. It had human eyes. Eight unblinking human eyes. All staring at me. We made eye contact. I felt frozen to the very core. Petrified with fear.



It was sooooooooooo romantic…



Day 35



I can’t take this anymore. I've had enough. I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to commit suicide. But before I do that, I’m going to try and upload this online. If I somehow get a signal, and you’re actually seeing this. Then there’s something I have to tell you. A message from me to you: I don’t know who you are. I don’t know the specifics of your situation. I don’t know a single thing about you. But I hate you! For almost my entire life, I’ve suffered at the hands of other people. I’ve been treated like a monster. Like a hideous disgusting monster. And now. Now I’m left to rot. Rot here in this filthy cabin, in this god forsaken forest, surrounded by thousands of giant clicking spiders. Thousands of hideous disgusting monsters. I’d rather die than go outside and face them. Than go outside and have to look at them. How can the universe allow such ugly things to exist? Such pitiful little creatures. A filthy pox upon this planet! And so I’ll die on my own terms. Die instead of going outside. I’ll make the only choice I’ve ever been allowed to make. Nobody will remember me. My corpse will rot and putrefy in this cabin until it turns to dust. Or the spiders will devour my body in its entirety, so that there's absolutely nothing left. Nothing.
