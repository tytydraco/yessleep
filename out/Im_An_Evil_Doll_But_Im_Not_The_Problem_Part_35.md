The last advice Ashton gave us

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/14G5JpKNsB




“He needs to die!”, Sue demands. 

My heart leaps at the way she’s talking to Art. 

Abe and myself are sweating bullets. This was supposed to be a status update, maybe getting a couple of his people to watch our backs. 

“By all means, have at it. The salesman has passed the point of being more trouble than he’s worth. 

I don’t see any of you moving.”, Art says venomously. 

“He killed…”, Sue begins. 

“I know who he killed. And that’s where the problem rests it’s head. 

If he’d turned one of you into a series of stains, his contract would be broken, and I could take care of him myself. But no where in my fine print does it say anything about, associates of those in my employ.”, Art interrupts. 

“Associates? You son of a…”, It takes both Abe and myself to hold Sue back from taking a swing at something that was standing by the switch when god said “Let there be light.”.

“We discussed the dangers, we discussed how involved I can and cannot be. Why are you three wasting my time with emotions I neither have nor want?”, Art says. 

Abe takes a large breath before speaking, “You’ve got a real way with people, you know that Boychuk? 

This was a message, and it wasn’t just to us. This salesman, he’s telling you he’s willing to think outside of the box. 

We’re here to give you the information we have, and hope you can make some sense of it. 

That’s if your done taunting my grieving friend.”

Arthur seems to mull the information over. Abe somehow remains calm as he relates it. 

“A man twisted by the search for otherworldly objects. Doesn't exactly make him the most original, does it?

I’ve never heard of objects like the ones you mention, but I know someone who may.”, Art offers. 

“We’ve got our own guys for that, none of them can find bupkis.”, Abe says dismissively.

“As I’d assume mine would. But I don’t think we need someone versed in esoterica. We need a Junk Dealer.”, Art says.





Believe it or not, the vast majority of the paranormal goes under the radar of people like myself. It’s not even worth writing a report unless something is doing a lot of bad to a lot of people. 

It's why local urban legends tend to last so long. A few missing teenagers a year isn’t worth the gas to check out. 

It’s also why so many peddlers of less than natural items, more or less get left alone. 

As we enter the dust covered, rust and mildew smelling store, Abe begins to count.  

While I’ll never be able to afford any of my own, on more than one occasion management has seen fit to outfit us with some kit that’s been given a kick in the pants by our lab boys. 

The assorted crap on the shelves here, wasn’t nearly in that league. Hell, it’s barely playing the same game. 

Cookie tins, half melted candles, stuffed animals, you name it, it’s sitting on a shelf here, half destroyed and with an almost imperceptible hint of the void about it. 

What I’m getting at, is this joint didn’t inspire confidence. I can’t see whoever owns it knowing anything our boys, or Art’s don’t. 

From somewhere within a backroom that I’m assuming looks alike a hoarder’s paradise, comes the proprietor of the establishment. 

He’s short, with a mop of grey hair that looks like it hasn’t even heard of a comb in a couple of decades. His skin is stained with grease and dust, small eyes hide behind coke-bottle glasses. 

He wears a brown vest festooned with the tools of his trade. Tiny screwdrivers, tubes of lubricant, and other bits and pieces make him look like some kind of shaman devoted to knick-knacks. 

“Coriander Shanksford. But you all call me Cory. Judging by the…look of you three I don’t think you stumbled in here antiquing.

How can I help?”, Cory says jovially. You can tell the man loves his work. 

“104. Ten meters bigger than the building. Not including your backroom. Impressive.”, Abe says catching up with us. 

“Good eye, or rather, foot.”, Cory replies. 

“Name’s Abe. I’m guessing you know where my friends and I are from. 

We need someone who knows a lot about things not many people care about…”, Abe explains our situation, omitting a few points of information.

“You fellas need to tell your management to reach out to folks like myself. Those loonies that go searching for Dracula’s candelabra , or Satan’s bidet , not one of them isn’t hip deep in evil. But us junkmen , by and large aren’t.

We sell novelties to people who can afford them. Part of our code is not to deal in things that could cause problems. 

Which is why I remember the Dutchman.

For every winking doll or, talking radio, we get a dozen duds. 

Things we get that are surely supernatural, but no can figure out how. They tend to get traded from Junkman to Junkman, usually finding their way into a storeroom.

Your friend came in about a month back. I get all types in here, and I’ve never been a naturally judgemental fellow, but something about him rubbed me the wrong way. 

He wanted to buy a lot of about 200 duds. Assumed he was a Junkman at first, but nothing about him seemed right. 

Offered me four times what I’d have made selling them. I was about to take the offer, but then he had a special request. 

He wanted to go through the duds. He was looking for a few specific things. Wouldn’t tell me what though. Just wanted to find it, and leave the rest.

Great deal for me, but something didn’t sit right. As far as the void goes, there’s nothing cloak and dagger about what I do. No need for someone to want discretion. And with his offer, that’s what he’d be paying for. 

I told him no and that was that.”, Cory explains. 

“Any idea what he was looking for?”, I ask. 

Cory smiles, “I didn’t, not until a week ago anyway. 

Three kids in their twenties broke in. Didn’t take any money or my checkbook, so I knew they weren’t just junkies looking for a score. Didn’t take anything worth any value, so I knew they didn’t know what was going on. 

All they tried to take were the items the Dutchman wanted to sort through. Didn’t get them out the door of course, it’d take a lot more than 3 kids to rob this place. 

But this is the point where we talk about how valuable this information is to you.”, Cory says.

 It takes a few hours for us to kick a request for funds up the chain. No internet banking back then. But by the wee hours of the morning, a tired looking parcel delivery man drops off a sizable check written to Cash. 

I’ll admit when I’m wrong. Cory’s back room was organized in a way that was both clear and obsessive. 

Abe looks like a kid in a candy shop. Sue and I can tell there’s a lot of stuff of worth back here, but Abe is a lot more in tune to that kind of thing. 

“Look at what your sitting on here Cory! The hell are you doing selling backwards running hourglasses to starched collars with a spooky fetish?”, Abe asks. 

Cory smiles. 

“You think you’re the only folks who care about what happens to the world?

Might not have the zip that going toe to toe with a vampire does, but we do what we can to keep nasty things out of willing hands. 

My day job is selling novelties. The rest of the time, I do this.”, Cory says proudly. 

“Pleasant surprise. I was half expecting to see a torture room or something back here. No offense.”, I reply. 

I’m going to do everyone a big favor and not give you the minutes on the 4 days it took us to go through the assorted duds. It was a boring slog, a lot more like spring cleaning than delving into the supernatural. 

We got to know a lot about Cory, and people like him. A few dozen phone calls had the eccentric little man calling in friends from across the state. 

In a world of death cults and insanity, these junkman seemed downright wholesome. Which made why the Salesman was interested in him all the stranger.

“How are you not smelling like liver and onions Cory?”, I ask. 

We’ve narrowed the search down to 20 objects we can’t positively identify. We’ve been catching cat naps, and drinking coffee by the quart. But we all have our limits, both mental and hygiene related. 

Cory tugs the collar of his off-white dress shirt, “Keep the best pieces for myself. This little beauty saves me a bundle on hot water and soap.”

Abe laughs, “This guy. Well, the rest of us need a shower. Let’s throw in a bit of sleep, and meet back here around 4?”

A diner burger and three hours of sleep on the cot in my office never sounded so enticing. 

The burger is dry and the dreams I have are strange. At least one of those things has to do with going unprotected on a couple hundred pieces of supernatural garbage. 

Regardless, the food and consecutive hours of sleep do wonders for my mood. 



“Cory, brought you a frankfurter sandwich!”, I yell, walking into the dusty shop. 

Silence greets me. 

I assume Cory is doing what the rest of us were and taking a  much deserved nap. I make my way to the backroom. 

Before I get there I step in something sticky. Being in my line of work, I assume the worst. 

But it’s just thickening coffee surrounded by pieces of a broken white mug. 

Still, something seems off. Cory doesn’t seem the type to leave a puddle of joe on the ground waiting to become an ant pool party. 

I draw my pistol, slowly clearing the corner to the backroom. 

I find Cory, gagged, bound to a chair, and looking like he went 10 rounds with Joe Fraser. 

I’ve opened my mouth to ask him who did this when the world starts to go black. I’m falling, a dull pain spreading from the base of my skull. 

I have enough time to realize I’ve been hit with a sap as I catch a glimpse of the salesman.


I wake to the sounds of screaming. My senses slowly start to come back to me, I smell gasoline and piss. 

“You fucked up, you know that right? That thing you do business with, basically second cousin to the devil.”, I slur, trying to buy myself some time. 

“That’s a matter of perspective.”, The salesman says with a giggle. 

He lays into Cory, he’s not just making a point, he wants to hurt him. 

I don’t need to say this, but I will, the sick bastard was enjoying himself. 

He paws through some of Cory’s tools on a desk, picking a long thin awl. He walks behind the old man, grinning at me as he raises the impromptu torture implement. 

“Easy! This doesn’t have to turn into a shitstorm.”, I say, not knowing exactly where I’m going to take this statement. 

“Oh?”, the Salesman begins, “What do you suggest?”

The salesman walks over to me. He looms, a manic grin on his face. I can’t read the bastard at all. 

“The slapjack to the back of my skull was your saving grace. I’m guessing whatever contract you signed forbid spilling blood, and demons love being literal.

I’m done with this, I’m done with whatever weird shit you’re into. I don’t care, I don’t want to know. 

You haven’t broken your contract, I haven’t signed one. It’s like we never met.”, I wish I was enough of a coward to be telling the truth, but at the very least I need to buy more time. 

“Genius!”, the Salesman screams, putting his face inches from mine, “My savior! Where would I be without someone like you?”

I don’t like the look in his eyes. 

“Or maybe, I don’t need to care about fairy tale contracts. Maybe your second cousin to nothing won’t have any idea what happened here until he sees it in the paper.”, The smell coming from the Salesman’s mouth as he speaks is rancid and alien. 

The salesman jams the awl into my leg, pinning me to the chair. He misses tendons, veins, bone and nerves. This lunatic really knows what he’s doing. 

I scream, Cory is crying, the entire situations is about as fubar as things can get. 

The salesman turns away, a small laugh overcoming him before he speaks. 

“Ghosts, vampires and demons. Doesn’t it all seem, vulgar to you?

How is the universe a mystery if everything has been written down, categorised, and put into neat little boxes?

There’s no fear in that, no power. Just a world ran on rules most people are too stupid to figure out. 

I’ve seen it, behind the veil. A beautiful esoteric chaos. 

And I will show it to the world. I will be it’s harbinger. To call it the truth would be an understatement on par with blasphemy!”

The salesman begins looking through the remaining duds. His grin spreads like a slit throat as he picks something up. 

“Do you know what this is?”, The salesman asks. He holds a thin small rectangle of plastic with two gears set in the middle. 

 I want to answer, but the pain in my leg is too much. It’s taking everything I have not to pass out. 

My lack of response angers the Salesman. 

“It plays sound, this one was found in a facility that was working on the technology for military use. 

You know what’s on it? Pop music.

Written off as an engineer having a bit of a laugh. 

Do you see the beauty? Do you see?

This isn’t from a different when, time isn’t a two way road. It’s not even from a different where. 

It’s from a different here. One of 9, do you see it Ashton?”

 “No, I don’t, because it’s not there! Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, man. You got a dose of something bad once upon a time. It’s got into your body and soul, and has you thinking nonsense. 

Anything you found, anything you’ve seen, I promise you, you can find by the dozen if you know where to look. There ain’t nothing new under the sun. I promise you.”, I plead. 

Cory is having trouble breathing. I pray Sue and Abe get here soon. 

“You promise me? Well that’s good enough. 

Why don’t we talk about it for a while, give your friends time to get here?”, The salesman says. 

I don’t know how to respond, he seems three steps ahead no matter how much of a nutjob he is. 

“Right now they are standing outside. They know something’s wrong.

Your friend Abraham, he will suggest the back door. He’ll find it, no matter how well hidden our scrap monger thinks it is.

Like you they will think I’m bound by that pretentious huckster. Which means they won’t be expecting that.”, The Salesman says, pointing to the door at the far end of Cory’s backroom. 

A thin, almost invisible tripwire, and a half dozen rusted pineapples from the war. The sit above the doorframe like perched doves. 

“I have a decision to make and I want you to help me. Do I let them walk in, and turn themselves into mist? Or, do I disable my party favor, and we all get to chat a little longer?

Tick Tock Ashton, they’re walking down the alley.”, The salesman’s offer twists my guts. 

“It’s not us you have to worry about, it’s Art.”, I say, trying to think of something. 

“Then better to work with me now, give your little god time, no?”, The Salesman says with a sneer. 

“Disarm the god-damn thing.”, I say, defeated, scared and out of options. 

The salesman does it, taking a spot behind me. I feel a small, sharp blade against my neck. In the seconds before Sue and Abe walk in I see the jerry cans around the junkshop. The pools of off clear liquid.

“I’ll be over there before you give him anything worse than razor burn.”, Sue growls.

“And before she does that I’ll have a bullet in your skull.”, Abe adds, weapon drawn. 

Cory coughs, wheezing, gasping for air. 

“Maybe, maybe not. But I can keep you three busy long enough for this eccentric little gnome to drown in his own blood. 

I don’t need to win, just stall. 

If it were me, I’d sacrifice a pawn to save my knight, but I have a feeling you don’t play that way.”, The Salesman digs the knife in drawing a thin stream of blood. 

“Your call Ashton.”, Abe says. 

“Put it down.”, I say. The words taste like shit. 

I watch the Salesman tie Abe and Sue. Evil genius, maybe, but he’s no boyscout. His knots are sloppy, more concerned with being uncomfortable than structurally sound. 

His back is turned, I’m making eye contact with Sue. She’s thinking the same thing. 

“The Cory is half-conscious clear his airway at least.”, Abe pleads. 

The salesman walks over, pulls out a white handkerchief and almost lovingly clears the blood from Cory’s nose. 

He turns to us, looking pleased with himself. 

“For what it’s worth, you three did manage to slow me down. I don’t think Arthur will want to continue our arrangement after this.

But, I never have all my eggs in one basket. The color was just one of my ways of bringing truth to the world.”, The Salesman preaches. 

“What is it like, where you’re from?”, Abe asks. He’s hoping to play to the Salesman’s ego. 

“I’m from here, sadly. But it’s not my home. 

Beings, they can’t travel from one corner to the next. They’re either obliterated, or approximated. 

Objects, they’re rare. More so because unlike other relics, they can be destroyed easily. But they’re quite real.

But we never thought about information. The power in a song, a film, even something as simple as a color. We never understood the blessings it held. 

The power.”, The Salesman answers, an almost religious fervor taking hold. 

 I hear it, a soft noise like ripping tissue. I can’t take the chance the Salesman does though. 

“So you’re going to take that piece of plastic and, what, play it on the radio?”, I say, a little too loudly. 

“No, once I find a way to play it, that is for me. I need to hear the voices again. They have so much to say.”, The salesman answers. 

For a brief second the volume of the tearing increases. I think the Salesman has to have heard it. 

He starts to turn toward sue, when Abe speaks up. 

“You’re real scary when someone’s tied up, you know that?

That’s what all this is right? Some power fantasy? You cosmic putz. You giant, flopping schmuck. 

You’re the punchline to a joke being told by some god or another and you’re too up your own ass to see it. 

Fucking kill me already. If the human race can produce a…”

Abe gets what he wanted, the Salesman snarls, throwing his gaze across Cory’s tables, a cruel grin on his face. 

In one smooth motion he grabs a mason jar full of assorted nuts and bolts. Can’t weigh anything less than five pounds. 

With a spin that shows more grace than I’d expect he throws the jar squarely into Abe’s face. 

What the impact doesn’t crush, the broken glass and pointed metal tears. 

Abe screams through torn lips. His nose is a shredded cavern, one ear hangs by a thin piece of flesh, the eye beside it pierced by a handful of glass shards and bolts. 

Sue was too late to save Abe’s face, but the shattering glass and rattling hardware covered the noise of the bursting rope well enough that she’s standing beside the salesman before he notices. 

She doesn’t quip, she doesn’t taunt, just levels a roundhouse blow to the back of the Salesman’s head that sends him ass over tea kettle over Abe. 

He's hurt, dazed, struggling to his feet. 

Sue drops her suit jacket, then tears off the dress shirt underneath. The tanktop below it is ripped away like a spiderweb. 

She stands there, in what you’d call a sports bra nowadays. But no one in that room was thinking about her gozangas, I'll tell you that. 

She stands, heaving with rage and pain. A beast from another time. 

Always been a few rumors floating around that Sue had a little more than human in her ancestry. Not as uncommon as you might think in our line of work. We have them all but confirmed as I notice a half dozen, almost imperceptible hooked barbs on her shoulder blades. 

“Square-up square-head. I’ll wait.”, she says stretching out a back full of shifting muscles. 

  She’s rung his bell, that’s for sure. He stumbles, unable to gain his balance. 

I’m almost out of my ropes. Not that I think sue can’t handle things, but backup is always appreciated. 

Sue picks up her pistol from a desk. 

“You want a gun? Make things fair?”, she says, lobbing the weapon at the salesman. 

He almost has his wits about him, takes him two tries but he catches the piece before it hits the floor. 

Cory mumbles something through torn lips, I can’t make it out. 

The salesman flips off the safety. 

*click*

“Now, what type of crazy asshole goes around with one in the chamber?”, Sue says with a grin. 

She slaps the pistol out of the Salesman’s hand before he can rack the slide. Before her next blow can land though, he’s moving. 

I can’t call it speed. He isn’t so much moving from one place to the next, as simply being there. It’s nauseating, like watching a film ran slightly out of synch. 

I can see the look of joy on his face, thinking his mojo has taken him out of harm’s way. 

Shit like that doesn’t fly with a woman who once put a poltergeist in a chokehold. 

The salesman fades, almost casually sue throws her left arm out. 

There is a gut churning, wet crack. The salesman stands next to Sue for a moment, neck at an obscene angle, head displaced my Sue’s fist. 

“P….Platter.”, Cory wheezes. 

The salesman hits the ground like the sack of shit he is, as Sue begins to untie the three of us.

 
 I’ve got Abe out of his bonds, Sue unties Cory.

“f…f…flower.”, Cory pants, blood pouring from his mouth. 

We assume brain trauma induced nonsense. I get one arm under Abe, Sue moves to pick up Cory in a fireman’s carry. 

Abe’s good eye widens, I know what’s happened before I turn us to see. 

Sue’s already looking at him, the look on her face is more annoyance than fear. 

I wish I had her confidence. 

There’s something different about the Salesman. A look of joy in his eyes, a sinewy wrongness to his movements. 

“Thank you Susan. Bravery has never been one of my virtues. 

I couldn’t work up the nerve to cross the threshold myself. What if I wasn’t ready? What if I was wrong? What if I never actually saw, or felt the nine?

But you, my beautiful lady, proved me right. 

I am the crack in the glass. The tip of the spear.”, The Salesman rants. 

Sue throws a punch. A wall cracking, monster slaying blow. 

There’s impact, but the Salesman barely notices. 

Sue charges him, but he squirms and slips out of her grasp like a snake. His body bending to impossible angles. 

He laughs maniacally, taunting Sue. 

Cory begins to breath erratically. Abe is doing his best to stay conscious. 

Sue’s no meathead, she ignores the Salesman finding the plastic rectangle on a workbench. 

She smashes it with a left-handed hammerblow, the plastic explodes, driving a good amount of it into her fist. 

“You Bitch!”, The Salesman screams. 

His moment of distraction is all Sue needs. 

She throws a series of brutal overhand rights. There’s a sense of hope for a moment, the salesman stumbles, falls, but keeps bouncing back.

He finds his footing, screaming, and goes on the attack. In a frenzy he grabs anything at hand, bludgeoning, stabbing and lacerating Sue. 

The situation is going south. Fast.

Sue starts to trade blows, her stance being broken, her strategy ruined. I don’t like the look of concern on her face. 

Then I see it. A left handed jab scratches the Salesman’s face. 

The Salesman backs off, touching the blood. 

“Do that another hundred times, I might need some stitches.”, He gloats. 

It hits me, pun intended. 

“The platter Sue!”, I scream. 

Abe goes limp, blood loss most likely, we don’t have much time. 

The salesman laughs.

It’s a cheap tin thing pretending to be sterling silver. Thin, light not the kind of implement that’s apt at doing harm. But Sue swings it like Excalibur itself. 

The pain and damage shocks the Salesman, he seems a bit slower on the uptake than we are. He stumbles to the side, clutching what seems to be some broken ribs. 

A second blow rings off the top of his skull. Grey blood flies, the platter bends.

Sue’s third strike, misses as the Salesman shifts away, he breaks into a run toward the front of the store. 

She’s on him, I lag behind, not willing to put Abe down. 

It feels the air is sucked out of my lungs, the front room bursts into flame, igniting the cans and pools in the backroom as well. 

I cough, ripping a piece of my shirt and tying it around Abe’s face. 

The salesman stands in the middle, grinning. Dazed and hunched over from Sue’s attack but unfazed by the flames, or toxic smoke building up. 

A grenade goes off, bits of shrapnel dig into me. 

“There’s a few more of those hiding around.

This little inferno is going to attract a lot of attention, especially when they notice the only things untouched are the Junkman’s trinkets. 

It's going to take your bosses and Art’s peons ages to sweep this under the rug. 

By that time, I’ll be long gone. And you’ll not hear from me again until it’s too late.”, He taunts. 

“Can’t fucking wait.”, Sue says as a beam comes crashing down with the sound of another explosion. 

If we left Cory and Abe, chances are we’d have caught up with him. But, he was right, we don’t play that game. 






“Holy shit.”, Leo says. 

“Christ.”, I add. 

I expect Mike to have some quip, but he’s got nothing more than a thousand yard stare. 

“Mike?”, Sveta asks. 

He starts to laugh, an unhealthy, doomed sound. 

Mike stands up, starts to poke and prod around is torso. I don’t know what he’s looking for, but it results in another burst of pained laughter. 

“Michael, what is it?”, Demi asks. 

Mike shakes his head.

“You know, all cards on the table, I thought I was going to come out with some kind of superpower.”, Mike laughs again, “Something like Leo can pull off. But, that’s not the way things go for me, I guess. 

Ash, you good enough for a bit of surgery?”

“Mike, what are you thinking?”, Leo says, concerned. 

“Maybe once upon a time, but son, these hands are far from steady now.”, Ashton admits. 

“Any other doctors in your crew?”, Mike says, knowing the answer, Ashton shakes his head, “Then I guess it’s going to suck to be me.”

And that’s where things need to end for the week. I’m not going to tell you what Mike has in mind, but if we have any luck, we’re going to be able to talk him out of it by the next time I post. 

Till then. 

Keep your friends close. 

Punch.
