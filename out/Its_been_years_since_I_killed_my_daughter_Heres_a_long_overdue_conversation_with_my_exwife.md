Rain pattered on the sidewalk, giving out that soothing earthy smell. Across the empty road, there was a diner with a blue neon sign. Tom’s Diner, it read, the letter M flickering. Through the fogged up glass, I saw the silhouette of a woman sitting with her fingers fidgeting. She was waiting for me, but I couldn’t bring myself to go—Not yet, at least.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked away from the trance she had me in, pulling out another cigarette from my pocket. I must’ve smoked four of them in the short while I was sitting on that cold metal bench—five of them now. The smoke mixed with the cold air in my lungs. I let out a shuddering sigh and faced the lonely moon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Well*, I thought, *I can’t keep her waiting all night.* I fixed up my curly hair one last time. I also made sure my leather jacket didn’t have a wrinkle nor a speck of dust.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With a countdown from five in my head, I lunged up and speed-walked to the door before my mind changed or came up with another excuse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I clasped my hand over the door, the green entrance light casting a glow on my face. After taking in a deep breath, I pulled it open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The air of freshly baked bread mixed with coffee smacked me across the face. A hologram behind the counter stood there wavering and crackling as the outside air seeped in. “Welcome to Tom’s Diner. Please close the door behind you,” it said in a robotic tone. I turned around and shut it. “Have a seat, we’ll be with you shortly.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks,” I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I purposely acted like I hadn’t noticed the woman staring at me from my peripheral vision. I scanned the empty diner, every unoccupied seat and table, before laying my eyes on her... Mia.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Mia gave me a sweet, undeserved smile. Her gray eyes twinkled with the hanging chandelier above her table. Caramel-colored hair cascaded down to her shoulder. I stood there paralyzed, going over all of the memories I cherished with her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I saw her and I running barefoot across the Mexican beaches. After a long night of drinking, I carried her up to our hotel, hotel number 505, I saw it so clearly in my head. We stayed up all night ordering food from the hotel menu and watching Netflix. We would always watch movies at home, but it was different that time because there was nothing to worry about. And nothing to do but enjoy our honeymoon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When her thin eyebrows shot up in confusion, I snapped out of it, rubbing my eyes as if I had woken up from a nap. Even after doing that, she looked surreal. I walked over to her table and sat awkwardly.

&#x200B;

“You look like you’re holding up well,” I stuttered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hello yourself,” she said in a sarcastic tone. “It took a while, but yes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry, Hello.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hi.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My eyes darted back and forth, looking everywhere but at the eyes in front of me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Uhh… They serve great coffee here, huh?” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not bad. Just a little too strong for my liking. Nothing a little creamer can’t fix.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I leaned towards the edge of the table and called out, “Hey waiter! Can you bring me a black coffee please!” I cleared my throat and sat up straight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You look tired,” she said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, yeah, no, I just got out of a uh… an afternoon shift.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where at?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Downtown at the little tech warehouse. The pay isn’t bad, but it isn’t good. It’s in the middle, you know?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I know,” she said, taking a sip from her creamer-filled coffee.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How about you? What do you do now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Same thing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh wow, still? After what? Four years?” I knew the exact amount of years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Three years, and yes. That college degree can’t go to waste.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, true, but I thought you might have moved by now.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Out of that… that apartment, yes. Out of town, no.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How did you—”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Soft, squelching footsteps made me lose my train of thought. I turned left. The waitress wore blocky rain-boots and apologized for the noise. She walked towards our table, cradling a tray full of coffee. She extended it out, I grabbed a cup of coffee and thanked her. With a smile, she walked away, boots squelching on the tile floor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\`I took a sip of the coffee and my face scrunched up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I told you,” she giggled. “It's strong.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I coughed into my elbow and laughed with her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So,” she said, “have you been seeing anyone?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The question caught me off guard. My face must’ve shown that. “Of course not.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh,” she said, averting eye contact.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked down at her soft hands. There was a glimmering ring on her finger. She quickly tried covering it up. My heart shattered in a million little pieces as I realized. But in my mind, I was happy for her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You don’t have to do that,” I smiled awkwardly. “I’m glad you moved on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I still think of her every—”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stop,” I murmured, shutting my eyes. I saw her so vividly, my daughter, our sweet innocent daughter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you…” I opened my eyes, feeling tears trickling down my cheek. She tilted her head at me and continued, “Do you still…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stop. I-I can’t, please.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“But it wasn’t your—”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was,” I cut her off. “It was.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mind tormented me with our daughter's little giggle. She had my facial features. Every mirror of my apartment was shattered or thrown away. I couldn’t look at myself. I couldn’t look at my daughter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alex,” she said, “you have to stop blaming yourself. I… I forgive you. I have for a while now.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You can’t.” I clawed at my eyes, wiping the tears out with angry strokes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How could you have known?” She said with a crackly voice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked up and into her eyes—my daughter's eyes. I shot my hands up to my head and yanked on my hair as if I could pull out the haunting memories. The memories of seeing her lifeless body in the coroner’s office and how soulless her eyes looked. They resembled those doll eyes that gave the illusion of tracking you. It was as if her glare was reminding me how I failed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My wife gave me the cold shoulder, blaming me for her death. She had every right to. It was my fault. I let her out of my sight. I let her get hit by that bus.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked away from Mia. “I… I can’t do this. I'm sorry. I can’t.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I was scooting to the edge of the seat, she placed her warm palm on my cold hand. “Alex, do it for me.” She had tears streaming down her cheek. “Do it for me. I can’t stop thinking of you and how you're holding up. Will you try something stupid? Will you finally move on? Let me give you closure—give us both closure.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hung my head down, letting out ugly cries.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I forgive you, Alex. Our Luna forgives you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked at her with my eyebrows furrowed. “How can she forgive me? And… How can you know?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“She was not the type to hold grudges, you know that.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought back to all the times she would look at me from the shadowed corners of my apartment. I felt her angry presence. I felt the grudge she held against me. She would whisper in my ears at night. Asking me why I failed her. I was supposed to be her hero. I was supposed to push her out of the way and save her. Or throw myself in front of the bus for her, taking her place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking at Mia through my watery tear-filled vision, she looked just like Luna.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry,” I said under my breath. “I have to go.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stood and walked towards the exit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alex, please,” Mia cried out from behind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I paused by the door, the red exit sign casting a sizzling glow on my face. I saw her through my peripheral vision, mind racing with millions of things I wanted to say. This was better for both of us—no, better for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I opened the door, the cold air rushing to get inside. The way the cold slashed at my face with a whistling sound felt deserved. I shut the door behind me, letting the gloomy night consume me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The wind carried echoes of child-like giggles. I nearly fainted. My heart sunk to my toes. Those were Luna's giggles. *What was she doing outside?* I thought, *She never leaves home.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I scanned the empty streets for the source of the sound, movement from across the street caught my eye. Sitting on the metal bench, Luna glared at me. Her legs dangled, swinging impatiently. She was waiting for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her doll-like eyes glanced at the fogged up window. I followed her gaze. Mia’s silhouette was sitting with her head hung and body shuddering. Silhouetted tears trickled down onto the table. It was as if Luna was saying: “It’s me or her.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The daughter I yearned for or the woman who I once loved, it was an easy choice at the time. I crossed the street and pulled out another cigarette to suppress my logical thoughts. Luna giggled and hopped off the bench. She skipped away from me, but I knew where she was heading—to hide in the shadows of my apartment.
