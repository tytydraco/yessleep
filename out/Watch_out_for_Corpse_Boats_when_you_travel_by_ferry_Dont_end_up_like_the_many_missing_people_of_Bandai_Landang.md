This story takes place a few years ago, back when I had just graduated from high school, in the summer months that separated my juvenile years from the coming dawn of (semi)-adulthood.

I was naive then, still a child without a care in the world, save for my life ahead of me and spending the rest of my ‘youthful days’ with my friends.

So we decided to go on a trip around the world to sightsee, to be close before we were inevitably forced apart. We journeyed off into the lands of the British, to the towers of France, and even to the deep jungles of South America.

It was all very fun until we decided to head over to a little known island by the name of Bandai Landang somewhere in the Java Sea. If you look for the island now it barely shows anything save for a few internet forum adventures gone bad and Bandai Namco, the entertainment company.

I think our friend Canopy was the one who found out about it. He was always into the weirder side of things.

The island can be considered a micronation, but the countries nearby all claim it’s part of theirs. Indonesia, Malaysia, and even China have it listed as some other name. No, I’m not going to share the ‘official’ name of the island- I don’t want anymore unfortunate wanderers.

Anyway, Canopy said the island promised exquisite beaches, awesome views, and untouched air and a sense of peace.

“I’ve never heard of this,” I pointed out. “Is it really a thing?”

He patted my shoulder. “It’ll be fun! My cousin’s been there and she said it was AWESOME!”

So we decided to venture onto the island. We were nearby anyway, and after asking around, Canopy managed to find us a ferry that would take us there.

This is where things go wrong. This is where we had to split up.

“I’m sorry,” the old man running the boat said, “the ferry's full.” And so our group of six was split into three.

Canopy, Myra, and Al went on first, and the rest of us- me, Quincy, and Jan would have to stay over the next day. Now it was only too late when we found out that there were no ferries crossing the next day.

“It was perfectly fine yesterday?” I snapped, confused. “The weather hasn’t even changed!”

The old man who’d ferried our friends shook his head. “Today is… festival,” he pronounced. “Water no good- there are things in the water. Evil things.”

“What festival?” Quincy demanded. But the old man had walked away, leaving us on a very empty dock. “What-” he sighed.

“It’s okay,” Jan assured. “There’s things to do here.”

I nodded, and we started to walk back to our hotel when a burly man appeared. He was white, not local, and had an air of gusto to him. “You three really believe that crap about the festival?”

I looked at him, perplexed, and shook my head. “No. We just want to get too the island.”

He took my hand and shook it. “Name’s Captain Murrow,” he told. “And I can take you to the island.”

This was great news. So I shook it and we settled on a deal. He charged double the price, being as that he was the only one willing to take us. And being naive kids, we decided it was a fair trade.

We just wanted to see our friends.

Besides us and the Captain there were two others on board- a rich couple that seemed to avoid us with their dog, a fancy chihuahua of some sort that barked at everything.

“Enjoy yourselves,” Murrow suggested. “It’ll be an hour.”

An hour wasn’t that bad, considering the flights we’d traveled and the hikes we’d been on. So me and my friends made small talk, and we chatted about colleges, journeys, romance, all the little things that made up life.

The fog rolled in an hour later, when we were supposed to have arrived.

“Excuse me, friends,” Captain Murrow announced. “We seem to have drifted…” there was a certain confusion to how he was saying his words, “...off course?”

Me and Quincy ran up on deck while Jan slept. We found the rich, pretentious looking couple bickering with the captain. “I can’t wait any longer with this riff-raff on board,” she hissed, dog barking in hand. “We’re going to be late for the auction!”

“Is this some sort of tourist trap?” her husband snarled. “I’ll pay you all you need to set us back on course!”

Murrow’s brow furrowed. “I don’t know what exactly is going on,” he told. “This hasn’t happened before.”

Quincy spoke up. “Maybe the legends are true and we never should’ve gone.” I giggled at that. “OoooOo!” he joked. I think Murrow found it a little funny, cause he smiled.

The couple most certainly did not. “Kids like you will never understand what it means to be on time,” the woman hissed. “Always late.”

Her husband looked out into the mist and pointed. “Look- there are-” he squinted his eyes, “boats!”

Jan came out, wondering why we hadn’t arrived. I told her we didn’t know, and the three of us- and Murrow walked over to the edge.

There was nothing out there, much to the man’s confusion. But the more we drifted, and the more Murrow tried to set us back on course the more it seemed there was something out there.

A sense of- dread? Fear? Excitement- filled my veins. It was all very new and interesting. A youthful adventure- a group lost at sea, ready to be rescued!

“Boats!” the husband shouted. “Look!”

This was when they came into view. First it was one or two, little wooden rafts that drifted in the distance against the ferry- despite the wind blowing the opposite direction.

And then more started to come, and closer they came. They were tattered wooden things, ripped by wind and cut-like marks.

That’s when we saw what was on them. “What the hell?” Jan whispered. “Are those-”

They were almost like dolls, burnt and faceless, strung against the boats, strapped downwards with odd multicolored ropes that stood out against the graying mist. “They must be dolls, right?” I asked.

Quincy sniffed the air and withdrew in fear. “I don’t think so.” I smelt it too as the wind blew, now harsh.

It smelled of decay. Burned flesh and the sickly stench of burnt hair. “Is this the festival?” the woman pleaded, asking Murrow. She folded her arms in disbelief. “Some trick.”

“I’ve heard of these,” Murrow murmured, now serious. “I didn’t think they’d be true.”

Jan asked him what they were as more drifted nearer and nearer. The answer was just as foreboding.

“Corpse boats,” he told. It was said an unprepared traveler wandering the seas at night would find themselves met with the rafts. They would smell the decay at first, and the burnt hair.

Then they would see the burnt, paper-wrapped bodies, strapped to the boat. It was said that once a year a couple traveling out those would kids would meet them- and that they would vanish forever.

And there was something else to them, too- staring at them for too long would-

The husband gasped before Murrow could finish. “Alice, look!” he shouted. “It’s- it’s Marissa!”

The woman looked blankly at the ocean, seeing nothing. “What the hell are you talking about?” she spat. “Of course you’re thinking about your ex at a time like this!” And then she turned to the captain. “Get us out of here. This trip is over.”

“No, look- it’s-” and then he stopped. And then across the boat, floating in parallel with us was one of the corpse boats, closer than ever.

The raft was different. Three sharp, pointed sticks raised upwards, and the foul smelling corpse-doll (what were they?) was impaled. A stick through the head made it look upwards.

“She’s calling my name,” he stammered, walking away back. He screamed and put his hands around his ears. He screamed and screamed, backing away, terrified. We started to back away, shocked by his actions.

And then he did the impossible. He ran and flung himself off the ship, whispering the name “Marissa!” as he fell.

There was no splash. Just an empty nothing. “What the hell!” I yelped. It wasn’t even a question, it was just- shock.

Hesitantly, the three of us looked downwards. No strung up impaled corpse was there. No husband to be seen. Just the fog, the sea, and the corpse boats in the distance passing us by.

“Don’t look at them!” Murrow snapped, finishing his story. “Don’t look at them or they’ll take you!”

We instantly avoided our gaze, returning to the center of deck, staring at the ground instead. The boat suddenly hit something, and it flung us to a side.

I picked myself up and-

It was in front of me. Impossibly, an impaled, foul smelling corpse covered paper, arms strung almost trying to reach me. For a second it wasn’t a corpse but the dead body of my high school sweetheart and I almost reached to meet it.

But I avoided my gaze and shut my eyes.

Then my hair began to be brushed, to be braided, they same way she would do it before she’d been killed in a car accident. I heard whispers in my ear, whispers I couldn’t make out that sounded all too familiar.

“Come with me,” I heard. “Float away…”

And then I heard screaming, and the feeling of the thing near me evaporated. I opened my eyes to see the rich woman tugging at Captain Murrow. “Look!” she cried, pointing to the ocean.

“I don’t-” he was tugged, “-want to!”

“It’s my husband!” she snarled. “How’d he get on one of those?!” she slapped Murrow across the cheek. “Get him back here.”

In the sea I saw a corpse, impaled and stretched out to reach out to her. The woman started back lovingly. “Don’t worry- I’ll get you!” And then she, with Murrow in hand stepped over the barrier and, with her free hand, clasped the corpse’s hand in hers.

And then she screamed. The body pulled her dowards with such force her arm was ripped clean off.

She screamed and fell over the edge- taking Murrow with her- but Quincy and Jan leapt to action, seizing him just before our captain was lost forever.

Like before, there was no splash. Nothing to tell us she’d ever been there but for a confused chihuahua and blood on deck.

We spent the next hour below deck, avoiding the rest of the corpse-boats. And just as it had all begun the boat seemed to right itself on course. The sun shone brightly, and Murrow ferried us to the docks.

I texted my friends, the three who'd come before- but they didn’t respond.

I asked around where they’d gone, and after a while, a visitor to the island told me they jumped off after looking into the ocean for far too long. I asked further, to the locals who had been on the boat the day before.

So many had vanished on the journey. They were only three more.

I researched this phenomenon as the years passed by, wondering if they would ever be found. This event isn’t local to the journey to Bandai Landang, though. No, Corpse Boats have been sighted throughout history and in international waters.

Be careful when you travel by ferry. Don’t look at the corpse boats or you’ll end up like many of the missing at sea.
