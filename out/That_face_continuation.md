A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me. *Those* Daniel's eyes. I spoke of code efficiency, while my own mind was an indecipherable chaos. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of "passion" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

"A true cryptographer doesn't just decipher the code," I said, my voice rising a little higher than normal, "they *feel* the logic, they *breathe* it. Where is that spark? Have you become mere automatons repeating what you're taught?" I stared fixedly at Daniel, looking for a reaction.

His face remained expressionless, like a porcelain mask. "Dr. Ríos, emotional fervor is not a requirement for mathematical effectiveness," Daniel replied in a voice that was too calm, too perfect.

It was the last straw. My mind, which had resisted madness for weeks, broke in that instant. This impostor, this being who dared to imitate *my* Daniel, was challenging me, denying his own essence.

"You're not him!" I screamed, my voice echoing in the stunned silence of the classroom. My hand slammed against the desk, sending papers and the pen flying. The graphic tablet fell to the floor with a dull thud. "You're not Daniel! I don't know who you are, but you're not him!"

Heads turned. Murmurs erupted like a swarm of bees. Dozens of eyes, between confusion and fear, stared at me. I saw my students, other professors passing in the hallway, stop, their faces reflecting the same question: *Has Dr. Ríos lost her mind?*

Suddenly, the fury dissipated, replaced by a cold, lacerating knowledge. It was me. *I* was the one who screamed. The one who lost control. The one who looked like a lunatic. The impostor... he remained as serene, as perfect as ever. Defeat struck me with the force of lightning. I had crumbled, and he had witnessed it.

Without another word, I clumsily gathered my bag, stumbling over a chair. I had to leave. I had to get away from those eyes, from that room full of accusing stares. I left the classroom in a hurried pace, almost running down the hallways.

"Dr. Ríos! Wait! Samanta!"

I heard Daniel's voice behind me, urged by a concern that, if he weren't an impostor, would have been genuine. I quickened my pace. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle his charade. I felt his hand on my arm, trying to stop me. His touch, again, that contact that was identical but felt so... false.

"Let go of me!" I screamed, struggling. My hands instinctively shot up, in a desperate slap to free myself from his grip. My blow, stronger than I intended, or perhaps he didn't expect it, unbalanced him. I heard a choked groan and a dull thud against the wall or floor. I didn't stop to look. I had to flee.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drop me off and pick me up from work, and my car was in the shop. I needed to get home. I needed my sanctuary. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real?

The ride to my apartment was agony. My head wouldn't stop processing, searching for logic in the chaos. I reached my door, flung it open, and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency overwhelmed me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of his closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A secret note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was.

But David wasn't in the apartment. It was almost three in the afternoon. He would be at work. What exactly was I looking for? My mind screamed in silence. I needed the impostor to tell me where he was. But he wasn't here. And I, only I, was completely alone with the hell in my own head.

A few days later, during one of my lectures on complex algorithms, tension tore at me from within. I felt his eyes on me... those Daniel's eyes. I had been subtly trying to provoke him during class, making comments about some students' lack of "passion" in their studies and looking directly at Daniel, who sat in the front row, taking notes with his usual neatness.

I ran out of the building, the cold air hitting my face. David used to drive me to and from work, but I needed to get home. Desperate, I pulled out my phone and hailed the first taxi I found. The driver's face in the rearview mirror. Was he real? The ride to my apartment was agony. I reached my door, flung it open and immediately closed it, leaning against it, my heart pounding a thousand beats a minute. I was home, but peace didn't come. A frantic urgency invaded me. I needed answers. I needed proof. If David was an impostor, then the real David... Where was he? How could I get him back?

My gaze fell on David's things in the apartment. His coffee cup on the table, his half-read book on the sofa. A knot formed in my throat. I began to search. In his drawers, under the mattress, in the back of the closet. I needed something. A trace. A clue. A diary? A note? Something that would tell me where my David, the real one, was. David wasn't in the apartment... it was almost three in the afternoon, so he would be at work. What exactly was I looking for?

Time faded in the urgency of my search. Finally, my gaze fell on the old wooden trunk that David had brought when he decided to stay and take care of me. It was his grandmother's, full of memories, and I had always considered it his personal treasure chest, something I respected and had never rummaged through. But now, privacy was a luxury I couldn't afford. With trembling hands, I opened the trunk. Inside, among old photo albums and yellowed letters, my fingers stumbled upon something hard. A notebook. It wasn't just any notebook. It was the small leather agenda David carried everywhere. The same one he used to jot down his ideas, his to-do lists, even small sketches. He never left it out in the open. He always kept it in an inside jacket pocket, or on his nightstand. How had I not noticed it was here, so exposed?

My hands trembled as I opened it. The first pages were grocery lists, meeting scribbles. Then, a series of dates and names I didn't recognize. But further on, on a page near the end, I found what I was looking for. A pattern. They weren't words, or codes, or hidden messages. They were a series of numbers, dates, and times, followed by brief descriptions:

"Samanta visit - OK" "Daniel coffee - No anomalies" "Call Samanta's mother - High concern"

And what chilled me to the bone:

"Table test (Monday) - No reaction" "Anecdote question (Tuesday) - Success" "Thesis (Wednesday) - All in order."

It was a record. A logbook of my interactions with the impostor. Of my "tests." It was as if this being was monitoring my behavior, evaluating his own performance... assessing how convincing he was being, his success rate. I imagined this impostor making nocturnal reflections and considering which parts of his act he needed to refine. Rage boiled in me, but beneath it, a chilling terror spread. Not only was he an impostor, he was a methodical observer, a being who analyzed my paranoia and adjusted his facade.

My heart pounded so hard it resonated in my ears. The trunk, the things scattered across the floor... they didn't matter. The proof was there, in my hands. It was undeniable. This notebook was confirmation that the David with me was not my David. It was something far more sinister. A knock on the door. Then, the sound of a key turning.

David.

The seconds stretched. I dragged myself, the notebook clutched to my chest, to the darkest corner of my room. I curled up, knees drawn to my chest, feeling the cold of the wall against my back. I heard his footsteps in the living room, the rustle of the things I had thrown.

"Samanta? I'm here! Samanta!" His voice, so familiar, but now laden with a concern that sounded like a sham.

I heard him enter the kitchen, then the bathroom. The footsteps approached my room. I didn't move, didn't breathe. The notebook was my shield and my weapon. This was the evidence. I was going to unmask him, no, I had to, and I had to know where my David was. The real one. The door to my room slowly opened. The hallway light spilled over the mess I had created. David stopped in the doorway, his face pale and his eyes wide with surprise at seeing the chaos.

"Samanta... What happened here? Are you okay?"

His gaze swept over the mess, then stopped on me, huddled in the corner. His face showed pure concern, the same face I had loved for years, but which now felt like a chilling mask. He didn't know I had the proof, and I was going to force him to confess.

"What do you want?" I snapped, my voice harsh, charged with a fury I could barely contain. I stood up slowly, my muscles stiff, my eyes fixed on his.

He took a step towards me, hands raised in a reassuring gesture. "I've been calling you, Sam. The university called your mom, she said you weren't well. They told me what happened in your class. I apologized for you, Sam, they... they're worried. *I'm* worried. You shouldn't have come back so soon, Sam. The doctors told you to relax."

His words, so calm, so rational, only fueled my anger. Relax? After what I had seen? After what I knew? Apologize for me? Humiliation mixed with terror. This impostor was trying to control me, to cover up the truth with a pretense of concern.

"Worried?" I let out a hollow laugh, full of bitterness. "Sure, 'worried.' Do you know what we're talking about?"

He stopped. His gaze was confused, but I no longer believed him. "Samanta, I know this is stress. What's happening to you is... It's a lot. We've talked to the dean, to some professors. Everyone understands that you need a break, away from everything. We've decided the best thing is for you to take a vacation."

He came a little closer, and my heart clenched with a mix of dread and despair. "I've been looking for a place," he continued, his voice soft, almost whispering. "A center. Far from the city. No phone, no work, no anything. A place where you can detox from all this stress. Where you can be yourself again, *my* Samanta."

A mental institution. A psychiatric center. The unspoken words echoed in the air, cold, relentless. He wanted to lock me up, he wanted to silence me. He knew... *He knew that I knew!* And this was his plan to neutralize me!

The notebook in my hands felt like a bomb about to explode. My mind stopped reasoning, stopped looking for logic. There was only one certainty: this being wanted to take my David, my Daniel, and now, *me*.

"No!" I screamed, the sound tearing through the silence. "You're not going to lock me up! I won't let you! I know who you are!"

He looked at me, perplexed. "Samanta, what are you talking about?"

"No!" I roared, my voice now a raw growl. I held up the notebook, showing it to him as if it were irrefutable proof. "I know you're not David! Look at this! Look at your own damn record! I know about your 'tests,' your 'anomalies'! I know you're monitoring me, trying to perfect your role! I know you're an impostor!"

His eyes fell on the notebook. Confusion transformed into something else, a flash of surprise, then... understanding? But it wasn't the understanding of someone exposed, but of someone who had just solved a problem.

"Samanta, I don't understand... It's my agenda, yes, but what you're saying..."

"Shut up!" Rage consumed me completely. I lunged at him, the notebook still held high. "You're not going to trick me! Not again! Where is he?! Where is my David?! What did you do to him?! And Daniel! Where are they?! Tell me! Now!"

My hand lunged for his neck, my nails grazing his skin. Desperation gave me brutal strength. I pushed him against the wall, my eyes fixed on his, searching for any hint of fear, of recognition of his true nature. "Tell me where they are! Tell me how to get them back! I swear, if you don't, I will kill you!"

The impostor tried to back away, his eyes filled with confusion tinged with profound pain. Tears welled in his eyelids. "Samanta, please... You don't know what you're saying. It's the stress. It wasn't a good idea to go back to the university. You need help, my love."

"Sam, please! You're hurting yourself! You're not well!"

He tried to grab me, but I struggled, my screams echoing in the apartment. I ran; I had to get out of that place... he ran after me. My thoughts were a whirlwind: I needed to hurt him, I needed to make him talk, to confess. He wasn't going to lock me up. I was going to bring them back.

My gaze locked onto the knife block on the counter. They gleamed under the kitchen light. They were my only chance. I lunged. The impostor, anticipating my intention, was faster. His strong hand closed over my wrist, preventing me from reaching a knife handle. We struggled, my rage against his strength. He was taller, stronger, and his eyes, clouded with tears, looked at me with a pity that infuriated me even more.

I felt his fingers squeeze mine, pulling me away from the knives. He was winning. He was going to immobilize me. I was going to lose. As we struggled, my other hand, the one he wasn't holding, slid across the counter. My fingers closed around something cold and metallic. The kitchen shears, the same ones we used to cut chicken. The imposter's face, contorted by the effort of restraining me, was inches from mine. My fist rose, the shears hidden in my palm. My mind processed the only solution I had left... and I did it.

As best I could and with what little strength I had, I plunged the kitchen shears into the impostor's arm, the very arm that held my wrist and partially immobilized me. Those hazel eyes looked at me with pain, pain and... pity? Damn crazy! What was he trying to do? His arm was hard, not like cement, more like old meat. Even so, I managed to pierce through layers of fabric, skin, and muscle. The impostor screamed, letting out a squeal like a pig being hit, and a crimson stain spread on his clothes. He released my wrist to grab his arm, where my precious shears were still lodged. I fell to the floor while he slid, leaning against the edge of the counter, to the floor. His grimaces of pain and the blood made me know that this impostor was not immortal. Maybe... if I got rid of him... my David would return! Why didn't I think of this before?! Of course!

Coming back to my senses, I noticed the impostor desperately checking his pant pockets, surely looking for his phone. I got up from the floor, approached the knife block, and took one of them. I'm glad I've always made sure to keep them sharp; what can I say? I like barbecues too much. Knife in hand, I walked up to the impostor. He was already dialing a number or searching through his contact list, but there was nothing he could do... I was going to get *MY* David back.

"Tell me where David is... NOW." I said in a voice I didn't know I had, that I didn't know I could produce from my throat.

"Sam, please. Why are you doing this? Stop, let's talk... I need help, Sam." He could only sob, only cry, only make that disgusting grimace of pain, the disgusting grimace that etched itself onto *my* David's precious face. I was not going to let this man or monster or thing, whatever it was... continue walking the world with *MY* David's face.

"Tell me... tell me what you've gained thanks to that face you have? How many more people have you been deceiving? Where the hell do impostors like you come from?" I had never been so convinced of anything before in my life... and I had never felt so much... control.

"Sam, Sam, Sam... please, love, I need you to st..."

"Shut up! Your excuses are useless... admit you lost. Admit you both lost."

"What? Who are you referri...?" A glimmer of understanding crossed that face dampened by tears, sweat, and saliva... it was disgusting. "NO! NO, Sam! Stop! Daniel is your student, your best student... Sam, please. You're going to ruin your career, your life... What the hell is happening to you?!" His choked, pained voice sounded so desperate.

"What do you know about my life and my career?! Oh... right, you impostors have the memories of the people you take, right? With me, you never could, you never could... I noticed it right away, I was just waiting. I needed proof, I needed confirmations. And you've given them all to me..." This voice coming from deep inside me was... ironic, soft, playful. I was enjoying it. And how could I not? I was about to get rid of one of the impostors... at last.

"Samanta! It's me, it's YOUR David. Please don't do something you might regr..." And silence reigned in my apartment.

I crouched down to his level with the knife clenched in my hand. I gave him a small smile while, with all my strength, I plunged that knife into his damn mouth.

"Shut up, damn it! I'm sick of seeing you wearing his face." I pulled the knife out and plunged it in again, this time into one of his eyes.

"You don't deserve to see with this face! You don't deserve to speak with that mouth! You don't deserve to breathe with MY David's face!" I stabbed him again and again and again and again and again and again. Blood bathed his clothes, his face, my apartment floor, and myself until he stopped moving.

HE stopped struggling, stopped trying, stopped making those erratic movements that resembled convulsions. Finally! MY David would return... without this substitute, without this thing that stole the body and life of MY David, he... he would return. But the other one was missing... Daniel was missing. The idea, so clear, so irrefutable, invaded me like a purifying fire. I wasn't the only one affected; families, partners, friends, colleagues... all deceived by that false and perfect mask. By that detailed study of memories, manners, gestures, everything! I had to stop him.

Without a second thought, I grabbed David's car keys. I tossed them in my hand; the sound of the notebook, still on the floor, screamed at me that I wasn't wrong. I left the apartment. The cold air hit my face, but I didn't feel the cold as such; my mind was a tunnel, a direct highway, with no detours. David's car roared under my hands. Red light, I ignored it. A deafening horn, I ignored that too. People walking, other cars. Nothing. My only goal was to get there, to put an end to all this. Daniel's image, his face... repeated in my mind like a furious mantra: Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

I arrived at campus. I didn't park. I didn't bother to turn off the engine or lock the car. I just left the car askew, the tires screeching on the pavement, and shot out, the back doors open, leaving an oil stain and a silent warning. The stares... I felt them, the weight of strangeness and concern, from the students, from the security staff. But I saw nothing, felt nothing, heard nothing but Daniel's name resonating in my head. And rage... rage at the deception. And a desperation that screamed at me that I was the only one who could fix it. The only one who had realized. Or maybe, perhaps others also suspected, but no one had dared to do anything?

I burst into the first classroom I saw. The professor, halfway through an equation, looked at me, perplexed. My eyes scanned the students' faces, searching for the impostor, almost smelling the subtle changes. Nothing. I left, heading to the cafeteria, looking closely at each person, their expressions, their forced smiles. My pulse was a drum in my temples. He wasn't there. I went to the lab, to my office, even to the men's restroom. Where was he? Daniel's name choked in my throat, and frustration burned me.

Finally, I saw him... in a study room, hunched over some books, his backpack at his feet. The impostor. I entered like a fury. He looked up, his supposed student's eyes widened, not in surprise, but in genuine panic. Without hesitation, I pushed him against the wall, my hands gripping his shoulders. I needed to corner him, look at him closely, make sure he hadn't changed faces again.

"You! I know who you are! I know what you did! Deceiving everyone with that face! You're not Daniel! Tell me where they are! Where are the real ones!" My words... every syllable was a hammer striking the truth. But Daniel, the impostor, just shook his head, his eyes pleading.

"Dr. Ríos, please... What are you saying? Stop! You're hurting me!"

My hands, my nails, closed around his neck. I applied force. He kicked, his hands scratching mine, trying to break free, but I was the only one who could stop this. And fury gave me brutal strength, a strength I didn't know I had, a strength to avenge my David and my Daniel. I was strangling him. His legs moved frantically, then his movements became slower, more erratic. His face turned purple, his eyes bulging. He seemed to be losing consciousness... I wouldn't have to see this horrible creature using my student's face anymore. No longer.

It was then, as the impostor struggled for air, my free hand slipped inside my coat. My fingers grasped the familiar coldness of the knife handle. The same knife. The same one that had finished off the first one. I gripped it, the gleam of the metal promising the end of the deception. But just as I was about to raise my arm, chaos erupted around me. Screams. Heavy footsteps.

"Stop! Security! Let him go, Dr. Ríos!"

A whirlwind of bodies surrounded me. Security guards, accompanied by more professors and students who lunged at me. I struggled, kicked, tried to stab him. But there were too many. My arms were pinned, the knife snatched from my hands with a sharp clang. They dragged me away from the impostor, who fell to the floor, coughing, his face bruised and red marks on his neck. Other students rushed to help him, their terror and relief palpable.

"They're impostors! All of you! You're deceiving me! Don't let them! Look closely at them! They're among us! You have to stop them!" My words were drowned out by the noise, by the force with which they dragged me away. My eyes, fixed on the faces of those dragging me, of those looking at me with horror. To me, they were still the proof.

I woke up in a white, spotless room, with cold sheets on the bed. The smell of disinfectant was stronger here than in the hospital. The nurse, with a kind face but eyes that seemed to observe my every move, brought me a tray of bland food. It had been a while since I had last eaten. At some point, in my mind, I had believed the impostor had stopped moving.

I didn't clearly remember how I had gotten here, only fragments: the screams at the university, the force with which they dragged me away, the desperate warning to everyone about the impostors. And now, they had brought me to this place... the place where they had silenced me.

My mother came to see me, her eyes red and swollen. She hugged me, crying, begging me to let her help. She saw a broken daughter. I saw a mother who, like everyone else, had been deceived by the perfect masks. I tried to explain to her, again and again, the notebook, the changes in David, Daniel's coldness, and how I had gotten rid of the impostor who had taken my David. She just nodded, with that compassionate look that told me she didn't believe a word.

"You're tired, my love. You're very sick," she said.

Daniel, my student's impostor, didn't come. Which, for me, was a confirmation. One less. The university hadn't called me back. That was another sign. They were covering it up. Or planning their next move? At night, in the solitude of my room, my mind ran free. The logic of my own prison. I knew I was the only sane one in a world that had been invaded by those... damn impostors! All of this was their fault... I saw the news on a small television in the common room... faces that at first I didn't know were now familiar. But how many of them were also impostors? When had the world broken? What happened to the real people? Would they ever return?

The only certainty was that I, Samanta Ríos, the cryptographer, was the only one who could see the truth. And that, in this white and silent place, was the heaviest burden of all. The medications dulled me, trying to cloud my perception. But they couldn't erase the image of his face. Nor the satisfaction of having stopped him. My David would return. I just needed to wait.
