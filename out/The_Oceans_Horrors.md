Boss: I want you all to sign this contract. It's nothing serious… just for legal measures.  
  
And so me and the rest of my crew members did. I did read it though. I know how "professional" I am.  
  
And that contract was… something else.  
  
"By affixing your signature to this legally binding document, you hereby acknowledge and agree to participate in the experimental voyage to explore the depths of The Atlantic Ocean and investigate The Titanic Ship, which tragically sunk in 1912. The primary objective of this mission is to gather information and insights on the infamous build of the vessel.  
  
It is imperative to note that this expedition has yet to receive official government approval, therefore it is considered hazardous and poses potential physical and emotional risks, including loss of life.  
  
In consideration for your participation in this expedition, you shall receive a payment of 25,000 dollars and any discoveries made by you shall be rightfully compensated in addition.  
  
By signing this contract, you acknowledge the inherent dangers of this expedition and accept full responsibility for any and all risks associated with your participation."  
  
Well, 25,000 dollars was no little money, so me and the rest of my 49 crew members took on the test.  
  
I have quite some experience diving, but to go as deep as where The Titanic Ship sank…  
  
I'm the type of person that laughs in the face of danger. I love adventure and challenge, and this was going to boost my ego like nothing else. To be one of those rare people to experience such a rare artifact underwater… not many people would dare get deep into the waters. Humanity has explored space more than the oceans. In space there's nothing alive (at least in our proximity), and now compare that to the undiscovered horrors deep in the oceans.  
  
Horror that I'm eager to meet more than anyone. No horror is too scary for me. Or so I thought.  
  
The day me and my crew got into the submarine came. A life-changing moment for all of us. One we'd certainly never forget.  
  
When the submarine is getting into the waters, it's truly an exciting and nerve wrenching experience. THe moment we all had been waiting for after preparing the vessel, making sure every system was functioning as intended (not that it was approved.)  
  
On launch day, while on the dock we watched the crane lift the submarine into the water. Once the sub was fully in there, we all started our tasks with activating the system to dive. More butterflies flew in our stomachs as the pressure increased the deeper we got.  
  
Once we were fully soaked in the ocean, we started our mission towards The Great Ship Titanic, on which many lost their lives tragically. Not the rich though. THey were the ones that saved their butts on the lifeboats.  
  
The Titanic being 12,500 feet deep, it took us around two hours to see its outline. I could feel my breath catch in my throat, as we got closer. The closer we got, the more we could make out the ship's windows, its deck and there were even some life boats.  
  
"Not even God himself could sink this ship," or so they thought.  
  
The ship that bestowed my eyes was greatness. Its sheer size was just one part of its glory. I took a deep breath in, feeling the fulfillment for achieving something we had strived towards for almost an entire year.  
  
I won't say that seeing The Titanic was a dream of mine, but it still felt like reaching for the stars.  
  
Or more like going for a black hole. As if it was a bolt from the blue, like we were struck by lightning. How could this happen? Why would this happen?  
  
Massive monstrous tentacles, ones only God knows what type of beast, ensnared our submarine. THe monster with its limbs dragged us towards it - towards the abyss itself.  
  
I couldn't get a good look at the… thing, but whatever it was, it wasn;t something I had read about before in the many books I've been through in my (rather short) life.  
  
I could hear the metal creaking from the force at the monster, and I knew we were doomed.  
  
My mind raced with thoughts about my family… I'm never going to see them again! God cursed the day greed led me here! if only i had known better…  
  
I don't know how, because while I was remarking on the past, my crew had somehow escaped the beat's grip, leading us away from it.  
  
but it was too late, as the damage had already been done… The submarine slowly sank into the depths of the ocean, even more than where the Titanic was… there was no hope now. The water started leaking into the vessel as I'm writing this now. we were either going to drown alive, or be cursed by the pressure of the water. Either way, there was no way out. The crew can cry all they want. no one is going to save the day. so much panicking. I mean who would think we'd need to be trained for… this.  
  
My wife told me not to come here, yet I refused to listen. I only managed to text her goodbye, as I wanted to use whatever little time I have left to warn others - DO NOT SEEK THE TITANIC! sinister evil hides in the depths of the void - here.  
  
My wife follows me here, so I may as well say this in front of everyone -  i love you! take care of our daughters! tell them i love them a lot! I'm sorry I'll never get to see you again. I'm deeply sorry for the pain I'm going to put you through, even though I promised to never hurt you…  
  
Goodbye, my love.
