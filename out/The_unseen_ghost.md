My house is old, it was built in the 1960’s or 1970’s but there was a block of flats that previously settled here and were torn down due to poor maintenance. Me and my family moved here when I was around 6 months old so this house is all I’ve ever known.

But as you may know with old houses, it has it’s fair share of ghosts. I don’t remember how old I was when I found it, but theres this old wooden doll bearing the name Sophie. I can’t remember if I wrote it or someone else. But she’s old, her limbs held together with flimsy string thats the same colour as straw, an old dress and a baby held onto her with a necklace, her hair made out of this same material holding her limbs together.

She has since lost one leg. I used to love and play with her a lot, but just like my parents I grew uneasy of her, she currently sits in my wardrobe, untouched unless I need something. 

But there’s a reason I’ve placed a statue of an angel facing the wardrobe. Because there was a reason I couldn’t sleep through the night.

You see, when night fell, I would sit in my bed on my phone unbothered, sometimes. Before I placed the statue, whenever I turned to face away from my wardrobe, I always felt a small person climb onto my bed and start moving from my feet to my back, slowly but surely this thing would slowly reach up to the middle of my back, and just stand there, shifting weight from one foot to the other. 

Whenever I looked however, there would be nothing there and the weight would disappear. It was like this for ages. Until it started getting worse. 

The night it started getting worse I was going to sleep facing the wardrobe in an attempt for a peaceful nights sleep. Just like the other nights I had fell asleep facing my wardrobe I had no issues. Until I felt it climbing. And reaching further. Until this time it stopped at my chest. I felt this really heavy weight yet stayed still, hoping it would go away. Only it didn’t. 

Not 10 seconds after it started it felt like an overweight child just threw themselves onto me. I tried to get up and run, but all I could do was violently shake my shins and feet. It felt like forever I was trapped like this when in reality it must’ve only been a few seconds. Eventually the feeling went away. I immediately sat up. Gasping for air, not realising I couldn’t breathe in my fight to get out of that trance. 

That happened a few more times during the night along with a horrible feeling of being watched. I eventually had enough and put up the statue when whatever it was started shaking my bed and kicking my mattress from underneath it. 

Nobody could fit down there though. Its filled with boxes of my things.

After I put up that statue I have only gone to sleep with the noise of a video from my phone and the feeling of being watched. A few times I have awoken to the statue knocked over and a bad feeling. Yet I simply faced it towards my wardrobe again and that feeling was replaced with peace.

Only now the statue isn’t working as well. I plan to charge it during the full moon but it’s the only angel statue I have. And I fear whats going to happen that night.

I don’t know how this doll and the entity are connected. I just know when I found this doll again and put it in my wardrobe, did the incidents start.
