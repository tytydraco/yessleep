You’re going to say I was evil. That I planned it all from the beginning. Maybe some of you will even say I was possessed, or that I was never really human to begin with. But even now, I stand by decision, even if not the execution. Rockport has always been a town full of small minds and big imaginations—two things that rarely go well together.

But I wasn’t evil. I just got tired. Tired of watching everyone sabotage themselves day after day, pretending life was fine as they dragged their dirty secrets and dead-end lives behind them like rusted chains.

If you’re reading this, I’m assuming it’s because Rockport’s name finally made the news. Maybe someone leaked what’s left of the town records. Maybe you were curious about the rumors—the blank-eyed smiles, the sudden disappearances, the way the entire town just… gave up. Or maybe you’re just another internet addict trawling for a spooky story. If so, congratulations. You found one. Only this one’s real.

I should start by saying: I was never “normal.”
Not in the dramatic, tortured-genius kind of way. Not in the comic book sense either—no exploding labs or radioactive spiders. Just… different.

I learned early on how to mimic people. Smile at the right time. Nod like I’m listening. Laugh in the right register when someone makes a joke I don’t understand. It’s not that I hated people. I just didn’t get them. They spent so much time chasing things that made them miserable and then bragging about it like it was noble. They fought about nothing. They obsessed over appearances and jobs they hated and pretended it all had some grand meaning.

And me? I watched. I catalogued. I kept quiet.
I was good at that. Pretending.
To them, I was just Noah—the quiet smart guy who always had his head in a beaker or tinkering with tiny machines in the garage. “A little strange, but harmless,” they’d say. “Smart as hell, though.”

I didn’t care what they thought. Not really.
But I did care about what they were wasting.
Their lives. Their minds. Their potential.
And over time, that quiet indifference grew into something else.
A kind of simmering contempt.

People didn’t need freedom, I thought. They needed direction. Calibration. Like a misfiring engine. You don’t curse the engine. You fix it. Rewire it. Adjust it until it runs smoothly. Efficiently.

That was the beginning of it all.
That’s where the idea of Clean Water started.
But I’ll get to that.
For now, just know this: I didn’t set out to destroy Rockport.
I was trying to save it.

There was a girl named Annie.
Of course there was.

You don’t build something like Clean Water without an Annie.
You don’t start tampering with the human mind without someone pushing you over the edge.

She was… kind. That’s the word people use when they’re too lazy to say anything real. But Annie was kind—genuinely. She smiled at strangers. Brought baked goods to the local clinic. She’d stay up late with friends who didn’t deserve her and defend people who would never return the favor. A saint, they said.

And for some reason, she liked me.

Not in a pitying, charity-case way. She actually liked me. She said I was “refreshingly honest,” which is code for doesn’t lie well. She laughed at my dry comments and thought my awkward silences were thoughtful. Sometimes I thought maybe… maybe she could be the exception.

I wanted to like her. God, I really did.
But she made it so damn hard.

Because every time she opened her mouth, it was like watching someone pour gasoline into a leaking engine and hoping the car would somehow take them somewhere better. She dated losers. Like actual, textbook losers. Drunks. Narcissists. Guys who hadn’t had an original thought since middle school. And every time they predictably fell apart, she’d smile through the pain and say, “I just believe there’s good in everyone.”

And I’d sit there, biting my tongue so hard I tasted copper.

Annie used to come by my lab sometimes. Not the real lab—that was hidden beneath my parents’ old garden shed, shielded and soundproofed. But the official one. The public one. The one with the little sign that said “Noah Rivers – Independent Research & Development.” She’d bring coffee and ask what I was working on, and I’d tell her half-truths. Nutritional supplements. Filter tech. Air quality monitoring. Nothing that would make her look too closely.

She’d smile. She always smiled.

And I’d watch her hands as she held the cup.
Her fingers were always trembling, just slightly.
Nervous system disruption. Probably stress-related.
Completely treatable.
Totally fixable.
But she’d just say it was “probably nothing” and change the subject.

That was Annie in a nutshell.
Every part of her that was broken was the result of someone else’s stupidity, and she carried it all like it was her burden to bear.
She thought that was strength. I thought it was cowardice.

The day I knew I couldn’t trust her was the day she called me brilliant.

We were sitting on the roof of her apartment, watching the clouds. I’d just shown her a prototype neural interface for the nanobot system—not the whole concept, just enough to see how it could help treat anxiety and regulate mood. She stared at it like I’d handed her fire.

“Noah,” she said. “This could change everything.”

I waited.

And then she added, “But you’d never actually use it like that, right? You’d let people choose?”

That word. Choose.
Like a junkie chooses heroin.
Like a toddler chooses to play in traffic.
She still didn’t get it.

Of course I smiled. Of course I nodded. Of course I said, “Yeah. Just options.”
But in my head, something broke.
Not loudly. Not like a crash.
More like the last snap of tension in an old wire—too faint for anyone else to hear.

That was the last real conversation we had.
She stopped visiting not long after.
Maybe she sensed the shift. Maybe one of her idiot boyfriends convinced her I was “too intense.”

Didn’t matter.
I’d already made up my mind.

People didn’t need options. They needed peace.
And I was going to give it to them. Whether they wanted it or not.

I called it Real Water before the marketing team—which was just me and a domain name—settled on something cleaner. Clean Water. Easier to remember. Safer. Harmless.

But before it became a product, before the glossy label and wellness buzzwords, Real Water was just an experiment in control.

Not in the sinister, shadowy way. Not yet.
It was data. Numbers. Neurochemical triggers. Hormonal regulators.
Microscopic precision engineered into something deceptively simple.

You see, the human brain runs on balance—dopamine, serotonin, cortisol, oxytocin, all dancing in a loop of reinforcement and reaction. And most people? Their loops are busted. Short-circuited by trauma, malnutrition, poor sleep, social failure, anxiety, resentment, ego, fear—so much fear.

I didn’t want to erase them. I wanted to tune them.
My nanobots weren’t machines the way you’d imagine them. No tiny claws or mechanical pincers. Just microscopic molecular frameworks programmed with reactive logic—when exposed to certain neurotransmitters, they’d subtly adjust the body’s response. Raise serotonin when stress spiked. Dampen cortisol after failure. Increase plasticity in regions related to empathy and reasoning. Encourage neural repair. Enhance physical stamina.

And it worked.

I drank the first glass myself.
A diluted mix, only a few thousand bots suspended in a pH-neutral solution. The taste? Indistinguishable from tap water. That was the point.

Over the next three weeks, I logged everything—heart rate variability, sleep quality, immune response, social behavior metrics.
My running pace improved. My attention span lengthened. Eye contact felt less grating. I didn’t suddenly become charming, but I could fake it more convincingly. Small talk stopped feeling like sandpaper against my brain.

I felt… smoother. That’s the best word for it.
Less friction. Less resistance.

But I also made sure to cap the bots’ directive protocols. No recursive upgrades. No cross-induction. I didn’t want to change too much. Just enough to make the mask fit better.

Then I made Annie’s batch.

Hers was different.
Personalized.

She had chronic sleep issues, so I included REM-cycle stabilizers.
Mild neuroplasticity enhancers to make her less locked into old patterns.
Emotion regulators—not to blunt her feelings, but to give her enough distance to question them.
I didn’t want to hurt her.
I wanted her to see what I saw.
To stop being so trusting.
To listen.

And when I gave it to her, I didn’t tell her what was in it.
I just said I’d been working on a wellness supplement, and I wanted her opinion.
She didn’t hesitate. Just smiled and took a sip.
“Does this mean I get to be a lab rat now?” she joked.

Three days later, she left her boyfriend.
A week after that, she started sleeping better. Eating better. Smiling—actually smiling.

And more than once, she stopped by the lab again.
This time, she asked questions that mattered.
Real ones.
She asked about my work. My theories. The things I used to keep hidden. And she listened.

It worked.

She didn’t become someone else.
She became herself, sharpened and refined.
And for a while, I believed I had done something good.
She was happier. Healthier. Clearer. She didn’t know why, but she told me one day, “I just feel like things make more sense lately. Like I can finally think straight.”

That sentence made me sit down. I didn’t realize I was trembling.

I had proof.
Not just data, but change.
And if it could work for Annie, it could work for everyone.

I never called it control.
Not out loud.
Not even in my notes.

Words have gravity. You say a thing enough times, it starts to take shape. And I couldn’t afford that—not when I was on the edge of something pure. Something important.

Annie kept improving. Beyond expectation.

Her sleep stabilized to a perfect 90-minute cycle. Her reaction time improved by nearly 30%. She began jogging every morning before class—then sprinting, then outrunning her peers on the university track team without even training like they did. They timed her in secret one day, on a whim.

She beat the school record by two full seconds.
Then beat it again a week later.

They tested her for PEDs, of course.
Urine, blood, even hair samples.
They found nothing. Because there was nothing.
The bots metabolized into inert compounds once their functions were complete. Self-limiting by design. Only the changes remained.

She started winning races. Easily.
The team began calling her “The Machine,” like it was a compliment.
She just laughed and looked over at me in the stands, as if she knew the truth—but not really.

Because the thing is… Annie still chose everything.
At least, that’s what I told myself.

She chose to wake up early.
She chose to ask for study help.
She chose to cut toxic people out of her life.
She even chose—eventually—to be with me.

We were a couple now. That’s what she called it. “Us.”
She said she’d always had feelings for me but never felt ready.
But now, everything was clear. She said I made her better.

And I did.

I helped her schedule out her study sessions. I gave her micro-doses of nootropic-enhancing nanobots to improve retention. I kept her nutrition balanced, her social calendar manageable, her stress levels optimized. I even wrote a few of her papers—not because she needed help, but because she trusted my wording more.

She stopped questioning me.
That’s what stuck out.
She used to argue. Push back. Call me out when I said something harsh or cynical. But now? She nodded. She listened. She asked for direction.

And at first, I thought: This is love.
Real love.
No drama, no manipulation, no miscommunication. Just two people in harmony.

But sometimes… I’d catch her staring off too long when I spoke.
Or repeating phrases I’d used verbatim, as if they were her own thoughts.
Like the time she said, “Freedom is just a word people use when they’re too scared to be fixed.”
She didn’t even flinch when she said it.

That was my phrase. I’d said it once, months ago, in a different context.

Still, I shook it off.
Anecdotal. Coincidence.
Influence is not control. I reminded myself of that again and again.

And when she said she loved me—really said it—looking me in the eye with tears and certainty and perfect neurochemical balance, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

Validation.
Not just of my theories.
But of me.

I’d made something good.
Something beautiful.

Rockport didn’t have much in the way of prestige.
A diner, two gas stations, a post office that closed on random weekdays, the university, and a single chain grocery store that never restocked the good cereal.

But we did have Mick’s.
Mick’s Market—half convenience store, half town square. It sat near the crossroads like an old dog nobody could bring themselves to put down. You could find everything there: cold beer, fishing lures, expired ramen, batteries, and half the town’s gossip.

Mick himself was one of those perpetually tired men. Portly, red-faced, always smelling faintly of grease and frustration. He wore his misery like a badge of honor. Every time I went in there, I saw the same scene: him slouched behind the counter, cursing under his breath about rising prices, lazy youth, or his trick knee. Sometimes all three at once.

But Mick had something most people didn’t: presence.
People trusted him.
So I knew if I could get Clean Water into his fridge, the rest of Rockport would follow.

He laughed the first time I pitched it.
“You trying to sell me fancy tap water, Noah?” he said, waving a hand at the bottle. “You ain’t one of those crystal energy boys now, are ya?”

I didn’t argue.
Just handed him a sample and said, “First one’s free.”

He drank it right there, just to prove a point.

And over the next month, the point proved me.

Mick started sleeping better. The bags under his eyes faded. He stopped limping. The layers around his middle melted off like snow under a heat lamp. His posture changed. His attitude changed. He started chatting with customers, smiling without sarcasm. He even opened a little juice bar inside the store—called it “Mick’s Fresh Start.” Cute, if unoriginal.

People noticed.
“Did you get surgery?” someone asked.
“Nah,” he said. “Just cut out the crap. Started drinking this new stuff. Local, too.”

And just like that, Clean Water had a home.

I set up a modest display next to the sports drinks.
No flashy branding. Just white bottles with sky-blue caps and a label that read:
Clean Water – A Better Balance.

I priced it low. Too low.
It wasn’t about profit. Not yet.
It was about momentum.

Within a week, I saw the shifts.

Teenagers stopped looking dead behind the eyes.
The woman who ran the bakery started offering whole wheat options.
The guy who usually shouted at his kids in the parking lot started hugging them.

Small changes.
Subtle.
But real.

Annie told me it felt like the town had “turned a corner.”
I just smiled and said maybe things were finally looking up.

But privately, I started a new spreadsheet.
Tracking behavior. Movement. Speech patterns. Frequency of emotional regulation indicators.

People were becoming better.
Not just happier.
Optimized.

And no one even knew they were being helped.

Of course, someone would eventually catch on.
Someone always does.

But I have to go for now, I will share more of my story later.
