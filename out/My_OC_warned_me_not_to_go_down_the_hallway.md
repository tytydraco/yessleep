**"Don't go..."**

That's all I could hear when my head snapped back up to face the teacher. Can't tell who was saying it, but it wasn't my teacher. I think he was trying to say more, but I guess I won't know now, will I?

My teacher, Mr. Ventnick, tells me I need to get better sleep before coming to class. Says I'm slacking on schoolwork. If the prick knew how to make presentations *not* sound like presidential campaigns, I might take him a little more seriously. Plus, last I checked anyway, I'm still passing with a *high* B+, so he can bite me.

I try to stay awake, paying attention to what he's droning on and on about. I *think* it's some shit about the Ottoman Empire or something. Basically, the same shit about the lead-up to WW1. I plug in my headphones and go back to doodling in my sketchbook. I'm sketching an OC of mine that, for all intents and purposes, is for the cartoon strip I do for my blog.

Most of 'em are just doodles, not yet having found a home for them. one of the last ones I did, though, seems to have served as an inspiration of sorts. I don't know why, but I keep drawing this guy wearing a three-piece tux and a fedora, with half his body missing and a chelsea grin, gleaming jagged teeth at me. Since then, I've now done three of these drawings, including this one.

I can't tell where he came from, but I know he won't leave. The drawings I *was* doing used to be of shit like superheroes or thugs. Now, they're more like twisted drawings of mental illnesses, almost Shawn Cross styled. I don't understand why, but as much as they kinda freak me out, I can't help but find them cool as well.

The first one I did had some guy walking down dark hallway, the aforementioned OC in the background. It was hard to tell, you know, and I'm honestly surprised in just *how* much detail I was able to give him in that one. You'd probably miss it if you weren't paying attention, but even still, coupled with the atmosphere, it was kinda creepy.

The second one I did was one of him, this time a bit closer, looking through a window at a guy, sitting underneath a bulletin board. After that, he's in the background again, but everything's dark, *except* for the guy and the bulletin board. He just stands amid a black void, grinning.

I stop drawing for a second, realizing something. I can't tell how long I've been drawing for, nor do I know why I'm drawing what I am. I look down, and there he is, the OC, grinning at me. The guy's not there this time, just half of a face, it's mouth slit from one ear to the next, and a hollow, dark, soulless eye, staring deep through my eyes, and straight into my brain. I was putting details on it; shadow lines, shading, and whatnot. Oddly, though, even this close up, I know he doesn't actually *need* much of any of that shit. Somehow I just *know* his skin is pale, waxy, and completely lifeless.

The bell rings. Time for lunch. I pack my sketchbook back into my backpack and head to the cafeteria. Everything seems normal enough, though, I can't get those words out of my head for some reason. I don't know why, it's just something about the voice...

It sounds like I *should* know it, but I know I *don't*! There's something else, though. Where am I not supposed to go?

I eat my lunch, or rather, a third of it. My stomach's all in knots. I can't stop seeing his fucking face!

I look at the half-eaten burger. It's almost perfectly divided down the middle, just a few jagged sort of ridges keeping it from being a perfect cross-section. I don't know why, but my brain's turning this burger pasty white, and giving it a big, blackened eye. I throw it down and scoot my tray away. A couple of the others around me give me looks like I'd just asked where the nearest strip club was.

I start walking out of the lunchroom. Why do I have the compulsion to get my notebook out again? I *don't* want to think about *him* right now. No, I don't!

I'm sitting in the hallway now. My notebook's out again. I can't stop myself from getting my pencils and pens out and starting to doodle again. In about 15 and a half minutes, I've turned a blank page into something out of an acid trip. It's a man being pulled apart in every direction; skin being pulled in one, sinews, muscles, and organs all being pulled into another, and blood just being pulled apart atom by atom.

This, by far, for obvious reasons, is the one that freaks me out the most. Coincidentally, I suppose, it's the only fuckin' one that DOESN'T have my OC anywhere in it. I *would* say that's intentional, but that implies *any* of what the fuck I've just drawn was "intentional".

**"Don't go..."**

I look around. No one's there. I know that's *his* voice, but nothing's there.

I go back to the sketchbook. I rip the drawing out, crumpling it up, and head to the trash can when the voice stops me again. This time I freeze.

**"Don't go into the Hallway. You won't come out of the dark the same, this time."**

I whip around again. No one's there. It's just the empty hallway.

I stand up. The hall is quiet. Dead fuckin' silent.

There's no light in the distance ahead. In fact, I'm not even sure that hallway leads to the other end of the school anymore. I look around me. I realize it's not *just* the hallway that's quiet, but the entire *school!*

I don't know why, but I can't see or hear anybody. The entire school is a ghost town. I try looking out the windows, and all I see is darkness.

I run for the front door, hoping to make a break for it, and I find the door jammed. I can't get out! I look back. All that's left is the darkened hallway.

Without thinking, I sprint all the way, until I realize something...

There's no ground beneath my feet. I'm running on *air!*

I keep sprinting, *thinking* I'm getting somewhere, until eventually, my legs start aching. It's not your normal aches, either, it's more like I'm having glass ran through every inch of my legs. They can't move anymore. I try to pull myself away, but I can't grab anything. There *is* nothing!

I'm on my face, unable to move. I can feel something strange, like my skin's being pulled away from my bones. I hear and feel tendons and cartilage snapping. I can't even breathe anymore. My eyes move all around as the sting of over a thousand stab wounds surges through my body while I watch the skin on the right half of my body start pulling away from me.

The sinews begin unraveling. In agony, I try to scream, but without breath, no sound comes. My organs and muscles look like spools of string or spaghetti being pulled out of me and tugged in all directions. My eyes roll into the back of my sockets.

I feel my right eye disconnect from my socket, before being pulled apart and unwound. I can only see from one eye now. I try to close it, afraid it's gonna be the next to go like that, but I can't move my eyelid, nor can I bring my eye back to see anything. The pain continues shooting through my body, before I hear his voice one more time:

**"You'll never come out of the dark again the same."**

After that, I hear someone screaming. The pain doesn't stop, but I notice I can kind of move again. I say "Kind of", because I notice I have the use of only one arm, and one leg. I can also still only see out of one eye. I try to cry out, but I can't say anything except for a gasping wheeze. I don't know how I'm alive, but I see someone standing at the other end of the hallway. I try reaching for him. He runs away screaming.

I start dragging myself along the floor, heading for the front door again. The paramedics arrive right as I'm about to give up, about halfway there. I'm loaded on and they have me on oxygen. On the ride to the hospital, I can hear them talking about how It's a miracle I'm still alive, and what the hell could have done this to me. I try opening my mouth, but I'm back to nothing coming out.

They get me into the ICU, where I am typing this now. I'm hooked up to so many damn machines, I might as fuckin' well be *part* machine now. They won't give me solid foods, thanks to the cloven esophagus, so I'm on a liquid diet now. Probably will be for the rest of my life now.

If I'm lucky, that won't be long.

I don't know just how I'm still alive. Doctors say that whatever caused this, somehow managed to keep *just enough* of my blood in me that it was able to clot, preventing death by blood loss. It miraculously missed all major arteries, minus those from my arms and legs.

I don't know how or why any of this happened to me, but this I do know. This thing, my OC, was sending me a message somehow. He told me I'd never come out of the dark the same way. I went in as a senior, soon to be graduating with a full-ride into a good college. I came out as something from my own nightmares.

My question is, would this have happened if I *hadn't* have drawn my OC[?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpseChildGospels/)
