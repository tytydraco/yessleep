I work as a freelance game tester. I’ve tested all kinds of projects over the years — early builds, indie demos, even borderline broken prototypes. Usually it's all pretty straightforward: find bugs, report them, move on. But a few weeks ago, I was assigned to test a horror demo called *Creepyug*, developed by a small indie team based in Nepal.

It wasn’t very long — around 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay — but it stayed with me in a way that no other game has. It starts off with your character waking up near a foggy mountain village. No dialogue, no hand-holding. Just this heavy silence, broken by ambient sounds like bells, low chanting, and wind chimes. The whole thing felt very rooted in Nepali culture and spirituality, but twisted in a subtle, unnerving way.

During my second playthrough, I came across a room that wasn’t flagged in the documentation. No notes about it in the build log either. Inside was an old framed photo of a woman standing alone on a ridge, near a crumbling temple. The environment felt too familiar — like a place I’d seen before. I couldn’t place it until later that night, when I went through some photos from a trip I took to Nepal back in 2019.

There it was. The same ridge. Same temple. Same angle. But the strange part? In one of my photos, that same woman — or someone who looked just like her — was standing in the distance. I never noticed her before. I don't remember anyone being there when I took it.

I brought it up in my test report and even included a screenshot of the scene. The main dev replied vaguely, just said something like, “That room shouldn’t have triggered yet.” A day later, he stopped responding.

I reopened the build to check again. The photo in-game had changed. Now the woman was facing the camera, and she was smiling. Barely. Just enough to notice.

After that, things started to spiral. I had trouble sleeping. I'd wake up multiple times a night, heart racing, sure someone was in the room with me. My cat, who usually sleeps beside me, started staying out of my bedroom entirely. Once, I woke up and saw a shadow standing in the corner. It didn’t move. I couldn’t move either.

The strangest part was two mornings ago. There was a message on my bathroom mirror — faint, like it had been written with a finger in the steam, except I hadn’t showered yet. It was in Nepali script. I copied it into Google Translate:  
**“तपाईं फर्कनुहुन्छ।”**  
It means: *“You will come back.”*

I’ve since deleted *Creepyug* and wiped all the test files. But I still hear things from time to time — bells, chimes, soft chanting — always when I’m alone. I keep dreaming of the ridge, and each time, the woman is standing closer.

I’ve tested dozens of horror games, some way scarier on the surface. But this one feels different. Like it wasn't just trying to scare me.

Like it was trying to *find* me.
