[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1d7m8nu/out_of_the_apartment/)

Before I give an update, I'm going to explain Drake's perspective of events from yesterday. He told me he'd also seen something odd during our neighbors' scuffle. Two women were grappling on the sidewalk near the mailboxes when one bit the other in the leg and then had a heel driven into her eye in retaliation. On the way to the gym, Drake was blasting Before I Forget by Slipknot to get himself hyped up. This drew him a lot of attention from people he described as being unusually pale.

At the time, he dismissed this as a trick of the light. Arriving at the gym, he got out with his metallic water bottle filled with purple Gatorade. As he was closing the door to his car, he became aware that an old woman was staring at him from across the street. Trying to be friendly, he gave her a wave. She didn't even do so much as blink.

Drake disregarded the interaction and went in. The gym was part of our local community center, making it free to use, provided we had memberships.

He didn't see anyone upon entering. Given that our gym typically received less traffic on weekends, he didn't think much of this. However, much like with my trip to Walmart, he found the contrast of cars parked outside to the absence of people inside strange.

Nobody was present at the check-in desk and Drake waited there. A minute or so passed with him drumming his fingers on its surface before he decided hitting the bell might get someone's focus. When several attempts of that failed, he tried calling out.

“Hello, I need to check in. Anyone there?”

All he got in reply was his voice eerily echoing off the walls. Finally, he grew impatient, figuring if someone caught he could explain himself. Getting to the gym, he was flabbergasted at finding two things. It was devoid of people and there were weights scattered everywhere. It was as if a fight had broken out the hour before he arrived.

“What the hell happened here?” he wondered.

In addition to his shock, it was also annoying that nobody had bothered to help clean the place up. A clear workout space is basic etiquette. Therefore, Drake took it upon himself to return everything where it belonged. With that out of the way, he was ready for his training session and began with stretching. Ordinarily, he'd be doing bench pressing.

Seeing as how he didn't have a spotter, though, he stuck to bicep curling. Then he did some squats followed by cardio on the treadmill. His method alternates while I prefer sticking to one thing for a set time. By then, he was about halfway into his exercise. We try to aim for three-hour days, two if work has been grueling.

Taking a break, he drank some of his Gatorade. His stomach growling made him regret that his only meal up until then was a PB&J. Thankfully, some vending machines were nearby and he went to one to get himself some protein bars. Drake spent a few minutes deciding which flavors to get before settling on one blueberry and a peanut butter chocolate. He punched in the numbers and then watched the coil push the bar to the front.

Then it hit the bottom with a thunk. He put in the numbers again. Unfortunately, the other bar got jammed.

“Are you fucking kidding me?” he muttered and tried shaking the machine.

The noise of his actions reverberated throughout the building. This is why he was unaware of the footsteps approaching his location. He eventually succeeded in freeing his second protein bar and knelt to get his food. As Drake was standing back up, he caught a glimpse of something in the glass’s reflection. A figure was approaching him from behind.

He turned around to find one of our gym buddies, a guy by the name of  Frank.

“Hey, man, when did you get here?” Drake smiled. “This place has been feeling like a ghost town.”

Frank looked at him in a manner reminiscent of the old lady from earlier. His breathing was irritated and raspy.

“Hey, are you good?” Drake asked,

Then he became aware of a smell that he described as being able to give road kill bathed in the sun for a week a run for its money. His nose reflexively scrunched.

“No offense, Frank, but you might want to hit the showers.”

Frank came closer. Until then, his body was partially obscured by the wall. Now that it was in full view, Drake was nearly shitting himself.  Frank’s right arm as well as a massive portion of his ribs were missing. Blood coated the wounds, dripping onto the floor. All the while, a deep hunger in his eyes was focusing entirely on Drake.

“Oh shit, he's a fucking zombie,” he thought.

He hardly had time to process this as Frank threw himself at him. Reflexes on point, Drake got out of the way, causing Frank to hit the vending machine screen.  Thinking fast, Drake tipped it over, making it crash down on top of him. With that worry out of the way, he left the vending area. His eyes bugged out at what he saw after turning the corner.

A horde of zombies were shambling through the hall. What was fortunate was that none of them were aware of Drake's presence. This changed when he felt his phone vibrate. His heart dropped into his stomach. He had forgotten about setting an alarm to end his snack break and it went off, blaring Pump Up The Jam.

All eyes, both whole and dangling as well as empty sockets were concentrated on him.

“Why does the shit keep happening to us?” he asked aloud while taking a step back.

I pointed out that it's only happened twice to which he replied it's twice too many. The zombies were after him like white on rice. With a scream, he turned tail and hauled ass. He tried going for the exit. To his dismay, more of them were there. His next best course of action was going back to the gym room.

He got in, kicked away the door wedge, and slammed it shut. He was able to lock it before the zombies came charging. They were snarling and clawing at the window. Red drool flew from their mouths as if it was Thanksgiving and Drake was the turkey in the oven.  He recognized a handful of people among them including our other gym buddies and even some families.

The most disturbing thing was how many families had been turned. Drake told me he saw several toddlers missing body parts. One girl didn’t have eyes and a boy’s jaw had been ripped off. I count myself lucky not to have come across anything that intense yet.  Drake stepped away from the door and pulled out his phone.

He dialed 911 and hit call. It seemed as if it would go through until the unable to send screen popped up.

“Fucking bullshit,” he hissed.

The sound of the window cracking caught his attention.

“Oh, hell no.”

They broke the door open, stumbling in. Drake went over to one of those racks, grabbing some ten-pound weights. As a zombie was running at him, he two-hand underthrew it. Luckily, the conventional “destroy the head” applied in this instance. The metal made contact with exposed bone with a sickening crunch.

Drake threw up on the spot, recovering in time to dodge one trying to grab at him. Another attempted swiping at him with its claws. He ducked, seizing a kettlebell and then swinging it upward. The zombie he hit was knocked back and fell into a few others, making them tumble. Others climbed over their fellow infected in pursuit of him.

Drake thought fast and scaled the weight rack. The zombies followed suit. As two were about to reach him, he kicked off the top dumbbell, getting them by their necks.  Several more tried were relentless in their pursuit and he also knocked them away with the kettlebell.  Looking around, Drake saw a high window.

If he got a good jump in he would be able to grab hold of the bars containing the ceiling lights.

The factors going against him aside from sweaty palms was that he needed something to break the glass with. This meant he needed to monkey bar it while holding the kettlebell. Ever since our time in that abandoned hospital, we made it a point to improve our physical health. This paid off.  Drake’s arms were burning from the exertion.

When he was nearly done, he almost lost his grip. The hand with the kettlebell slipped. Drake yelled, only having one arm for support. In this position, he would have just one shot. Froutnetaly, his upper body strength endured.

He threw the kettlebell, shattering the window. Drake swung himself to it and crouched, ensuring the coast was clear. After confirming it was, he dropped down. He raced to his truck, hitting the unlock button on his keys. As he was putting his keys in the ignition, more zombies came from behind some shops.

He turned it. The engine revved up and then immediately shut off. Our vehicles need some serious tune-ups.

“God fucking damn it,” he shrieked. “Stupid fucking Ford piece of shit.”

The zombies dog piled on the rack as he kept turning the keys while slamming on the gas. Finally, it roared back to life. He put it in reverse and backed out, running over some of them. He guessed I’d still be at Walmart and sped over there to get me. That pretty much brings everything up to speed.

As for what we’ve been doing today, we’ve mostly been scavenging for supplies, mainly guns. We do have the axes to defend ourselves with. However, close combat increases the risk of infection. We haven't been successful, which isn't surprising since the gun stores in town are nowhere near the hotel. That said, we did get some things from a tool shop.

The place was a mess and there was evidence a fatal struggle had taken place, judging from all the blood we found, not to mention the severed leg. The most useful things in the store were portable nail guns. My dad, when he was still around, worked in construction and he showed me how they worked. He would even let me use it to shoot at some cans he set up in the backyard. Granted, letting an eight-year-old handle something such as that probably wasn't the best parenting.

I suppose one too many beers will make anything seem like a good idea. At least it's helping us now. We've gone to the gun range every once in a while so our aim has improved. As an aside, we were meaning to purchase a firearm. Lack of funding precluded us from saving up enough for one.

There's also a thrift store across the street. We decided to check it out. You never know what stuff those kinds of places might have. The one we visited happened to have a pair of binoculars which is handy. We got some clothes from there. Good thing this hotel has a laundry room.

I know it doesn't seem like a high priority, but if we're going to be moving around a lot for the foreseeable future, a fresh change of wardrobe is going to do us some good. We did find things to help keep us occupied. That's something a lot of movies don't touch on all that much I think. I mean, what do characters do between fighting, running, and talking? In our case, the thrift store had some DVDs, a player, some board games, and card games.  Playing Monopoly with only two people has made us realize how overrated it is and we called it quits an hour in. Uno has been another option.

However, stun locking with arguments on what plays are allowed or who shouted Uno first has dampened the game's mood.

We already tried seeing if our hotel TV has cable with no luck. At least we got the PlayStation we grabbed hooked up. I've been watching Drake on Metal Gear Solid while he's been watching me play Spyro.

Other than that, movie marathoning has worked well as a distraction.

For the most part, I should say since this has mainly revolved around the Living Dead movies. I think it's a bit tasteless given what we're dealing with. Drake says it's going to prepare us more.  Only time will tell how that'll pan out, I guess. For now, I'm bunkering down for the night or trying to anyway.

Sleeping does not come easy when I can hear those things outside even if they are far away. I'll keep you all informed, nonetheless. [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) you [tomorrow.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
