There are a lot of ghost stories in the small town where I grew up. We live next to a big cemetery laying at the end of the winding main road that runs from the start of the town to the public park right outside of the old cemetery’s gate. It isn’t hard to feel spooked or believe spooky things happen in there. 

As a kid, I was terrified of these stories from the older kids. As I grow up, I terrify the kids with them. Every time I retell a story I jazz them up a bit more, add more ghost story cliches to them and feel satisfied seeing the little kids captivated and scared. There have always been numerous of rules about the cemetery the adults make up. 

Hold your breath when you walk pass its gate. Don’t turn around if you hear someone calls your name. Don’t take and bring home anything from inside the cemetery. Keep walking if you see someone waving from afar. Don’t play hide and seek in there or you will never be found. I couldn’t list them all. 

Each rule always comes with some sort of ghostly tale for why you should obey it. We make up new rules and stories as the kids get smarter and less easily spooked. It’s like a tradition passed on through generations to scare the kids about the cemetery. I think it’s good as it keeps the old and withering cemetery intact, and teach the kids respect for people’s final resting places. 

There’s one rule that seems intended to scare off the adults too though. If there’s a picture of a person on their headstone, do not stare at them for long and make any comment about it out loud, especially if it’s someone you don’t know. 
- Why though? 

My brother and I would laugh every time my mom hushed or scowled at us for making fun of it at the dinner table. 
- They will follow you! It has happened to people. 
- I’ve looked at all the pictures in there. At least the ones we see around and nearby dad’s. Gotta say hi to his neighbors or it’s very rude mom. 

My brother would laugh and my mom would smacked his arms with a horrified look on her face.  
- You didn’t! And you will not! I’m serious! 
 
She would say firmly and went on to relay to us the spooky stories of when “this and that had happened to so and so after they did it” and we would just laugh it off.

My brother and I grew up close even when I moved to the city for school and stayed there for a job. My brother stayed close to home, close to mom. He got married. I was the ring bearer at his wedding. He had sons. I became their godmother. Every time I came back to visit our home town, my brother would drive me around and show me all the new stores and places that had opened. We would catch up on life over late drinks at his house. He would always want to know for sure my “city life” was all good. 

My brother was driving home three days ago when a car ran a red light and drove directly into his car. The driver side of his car was smashed into pieces. My brother died on the scene. 

Everything that happened after we got the news was a blur. I got home. I talked to the police. I made it to the close casket funeral. I dressed my little nephews up in black. But I didn’t see my brother.

 Now I’m standing here in the old cemetery watching them lowering the casket to the ground with my brother inside. The last time I saw him was from my last visit, at my mom’s dinner table, laughing, scaring his kids with story about this very cemetery. And now he stays here. 
- Did we put a picture on his headstone? 

I hear myself speaking, my eyes stay on the dirt starting to mount on the casket. 

- What? 

I’m not sure if it’s my mom or my sister in law asking. 

- We should put his picture on his headstone. So we can look, and he’ll follow us home. Right? 

I hear my mom sobbing and feel someone putting their arm over me. I shrug it off and walk away. I want to find a headstone with a picture on it. I will look and make a comment. I will talk to it, tell it to come, to follow me. For once, I want to know if this rule of the cemetery actually works. I want it to work. 

I will realize later that this is a horrible idea.
