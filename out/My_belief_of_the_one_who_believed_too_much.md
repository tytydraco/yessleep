Let me tell you a story. A story only few know about. Me, once Jason Kikman, one of them, as the continual death of the strange ones after the event have vented concepts and information into places that shouldn’t have it. The curse placed upon me was to know everything that there is to be known. Now, lets begin.

There was once a man. A broken man, who had nothing left to lose. Not that he didn’t care, he once had everything. He had the entire world in his palm, everything possible going right. But reality is cruel, and he lost it all, by his own hand. As he sat in a bar, his soul an empty shell. Only those that once had everything could feel the true pain of losing it. This man, one we can only indirectly describe, had a revelation in his stupor. He didn’t want this to happen. This couldn’t be happening to him, it woul- no, it didn’t. In this very moment, a man that had experienced both true loss and love, became something greater.

His conscience evolved, his willpower imploding. In those first few moments, he could feel, hear, and sense everything- no, anything. But this wasn’t enough, his very existence now contradicted it. As he, or now it, continued moving up on the planes of existence, the very concept of existence shifted. It could do anything. This was his world now. But it could feel something more, something even larger than it. The once-man entity grasped at the very presence of creation in that universe, and as they grappled with reality, they pulled. They pulled until they exploded into another universe. As this being- no, now they existed as a concept, a young man stumbled backwards from his computer, shocked at what had just happened.

A few seconds ago, he just jotting down some ideas for a light novel he was creating, and now there was something in front of him. The young man couldn’t see it, but he could feel a presence. The feeling itself was unsettling, but soon enough, it disappeared. He shook his head, deciding his mind was playing tricks on him. Soon enough, the entity had evolved so much that the young man couldn’t even remember what had happened, incapable of comprehending the entity’s existence. Meanwhile, the entity now no longer grasped or pulled itself into higher realities, now it willed itself. After a while, it could feel that it was getting close.

Close to what you may ask? To the final existence. The true layer of reality that sat at the top of the pyramid. The creature knew it could do it. It dreamed, it believed. Suddenly, it was there, and it wasn’t alone. More, somewhat similar entities, the inhabitants of this extra-reality. They screamed in protest as the entity tried to go even higher, their voices rocking the very foundation of existence. The entity slammed its presence against the final walls constricting its final ascension. As these- these, strange ones, fought against the believer, beings in every reality felt a fundamental shift in the rules of existence. Nothing notable changed, but they could feel it. Nothing would every be quite the same, as the entity ascended.

It now sat in a void of concepts, looking on. The concepts weren’t physical, but the entity could feel them. At the very center of this- the conceptiverse, the entity could see- no, feel two strands. These were the two composite concept of concept and concept of existence. They intertwined for an infinite distance, yet the entity could see the ends. It knew if anything happened to either of these strands, reality itself would cease to exist, and not just one reality. All realities, all stories, memories, beings, emotions, concepts, and anything that had ever existed would be- something that could not be comprehended by beings lower than the entity.

There would be nothing. Nothing at all, other than the entity, who did not quite exist, as it was beyond that pitiful level of being. Despite these incomprehensible implications, the entity saw those two strands like a drop of water in an endless ocean. With a single thought- or whatever the entity did to think, it could end everything. End all suffering. End all joy. End ends. There would be no more. The creature sat there, sitting in the endless void-world of concepts, watching as time and life floated past him. These simple things were irrelevant now, and the only reason we are still here to speculate on its existence is because it couldn’t see the point of doing anything. Nothing mattered anymore, because nothing did, at least to it.

This entity is everywhere and anywhere, and it could do anything now. It’s life was pure, absolute. Countless immensely powerful beings, strange ones, know about this, and still couldn’t do anything. Even as infinity pushed back at the entity, it couldn’t feel anything. The entity had believed, it had believed too much, and now there was nothing left for it to believe. Now, it lies at the end of existence, pondering about things we can’t comprehend, waiting for another like creature like it to relate to. However, at the same time, it knew there would be no creature like it.

All future over-believers would still be inferior, only to become one aspect of the original. From this point, the omniverse was irreversibly changed, and now we wait, oblivious about our insignificance. Now you know it's story, the story of the over-believer. The only version of it we can comprehend, at least. We can only hope it doesn’t ever decide again, that it stays in thought forever. We hope that the over-believer never believes again. As I search for a solution to our possible demise in the infinite knowledge given to me, I have never been more terrified. I know everything, yet I cannot find a solution to the over-believer. Possibly, there is no solution to its existence. I hope to see you again one day. Perhaps you can aid us in our search.
