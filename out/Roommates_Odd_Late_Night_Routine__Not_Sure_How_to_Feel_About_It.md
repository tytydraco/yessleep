Here seems like a good place to post this.

I wanted to share something strange that's been happening with my roommate lately, and I'm honestly not sure if it's worth being concerned about or if I'm just overthinking it.

A bit of context: My girlfriend and I recently moved to a new city for her college, and we found this great deal on a condo with another couple – let's call them John and Jane. The rent's affordable, the room’s big, and John and Jane are actually pretty easygoing. We rarely have issues with chores or space, and when there is something to sort out, it’s quick and easy. They’re nice people too – they often cook big meals for holidays and invite us, which has made moving easier.

Now, here’s the weird part.

I’m a musician, so I usually get home around 2 or 3 AM after gigs. Our room is next to the main door, so I don't even pass by their room, but one night I was starving and decided to make some ramen in the kitchen. The kitchen is close to John and Jane’s room, and with the thin walls, sound travels. I was trying to be quiet, but I could hear Jane saying something in a monotone voice. It was a series of numbers, repeated in the same way. I figured it was something study-related, maybe a technique she uses to memorize stuff. It sounded odd, but I brushed it off as a late-night habit.

But here’s where it started getting unsettling. Over the next few nights, it kept happening. Every time, the numbers were different, yet each time they came out exactly the same: the same tone, the same pace, no variation. I began to realize it didn’t sound like someone casually studying – it was too exact, like listening to a recording. I mentioned it to my girlfriend, who just suggested ignoring it since it wasn’t affecting us.

Then, two nights ago, I went to the kitchen again and heard her. But this time, it wasn’t numbers. It was this strange, drawn-out “huuuhhhh” sound, like a heavy exhausted sigh, but has a creepy quality to it. The first one startled me, but what got me was the repetition. Each sigh was identical, like an audio loop, with no natural variation. There was something eerie about how precise it was – too precise to sound human.

I didn’t cook that night. I just stood there, listening, feeling a chill run down my spine before going straight back to bed. Since then, it’s been stuck in my mind, like she’s still out there, sighing just outside my door. I haven’t gone back to the kitchen late at night since and have just started prepping my meals beforehand.

With our opposite schedules, we rarely run into them, so bringing it up might feel intrusive. But I can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t quite right. I’ll admit I’m curious, though, and I’m considering passing by the kitchen tonight… I’ll keep you all updated.
