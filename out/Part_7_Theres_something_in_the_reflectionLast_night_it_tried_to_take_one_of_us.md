The bruise on my shoulder was still there when I came back the next night—five perfect fingerprints, dark and blooming like frostbite beneath my skin.

The old man was already waiting by the counter, as if he hadn’t moved since the last shift.

“One night left,” he murmured. “Until your final evaluation.” His voice was soft, but the weight of it hit me like a punch to the chest. After everything, I’d almost managed to forget that tomorrow might decide whether I live or die.

Across the store, I spotted Dante.

He looked... off. Gaunt. Eyes red-rimmed and sunken like he’d cried until nothing was left. His body seemed lighter somehow—like a balloon with all the air let out. No one walks away from this place unchanged. Not really.

“You okay?” I asked, laying a hand gently on his shoulder. He jerked back hard. Then, seeing it was me, he wilted. “Oh. It’s you,” he muttered, eyes twitching from shelf to shelf like something might leap out. “Yeah. I’m fine.”

He didn’t sound fine. He sounded like a cornered animal.

“You sure, Dante?”

“Yeah, Remi. I’m fine,” he repeated—too quick, too flat. An answer rehearsed, not felt. I didn’t push. Pity crawled down my throat like a swallowed stone.

Then he tried to smile—

tried.

And failed.

“It’s a holiday tomorrow,” he said. “We get the night off.” The words hit like ice water. This meant one thing. Tomorrow night, I’d be here. Alone. For my final evaluation.

“Not for me,” I said avoiding his gaze.

“Why not?” he asked, confused. 

I forced the words out. “My evaluation,” I said again, slower this time. He frowned. “What even is that?” 

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Not even the old man—”

“Let’s look on the bright side,” he cut in. “Five more days, right? Then we’re both done.”

I stared at him. “What?”

“Our contract,” he said, like it should’ve been obvious. “It’s for a week. Seven days. After that, we walk.”

I stared at him. “Dante… I signed for a year.”

He froze.

“What?” he whispered.

“A full year. Why is your contract different?”

His fragile grin shattered. Color drained from his face.

Before he could answer, a voice behind us cut the air like a blade. 

“Because some of you aren’t meant to last longer than that,” said the old man. We both jumped. I hadn’t even heard him approach. He stood just a few feet away, holding that blank clipboard like it weighed a thousand pounds.

“What does that mean?” I asked. He didn’t answer me. He looked only at Dante.

“Some people burn fast,” he said. “The store knows. It always knows. How long each of you will last.” Then, quieter: “Some don’t even make it a week.”

And then he turned, his shoes silent against the tile, and disappeared back into the fluorescent hum.

I turned to Dante.

He wasn’t smiling anymore.

10:30 p.m.

Half an hour before the shift.

Half an hour before the lights deepen, the hum drops an octave, and the store starts breathing again.

I dragged Dante into the break room and shut the door behind us.

“Sit,” I said. “I only have thirty minutes to tell you everything.”

He blinked at me, thrown by how serious I sounded, but he sat. Nervous energy radiated off him; his knee bounced like a jackhammer.

I started with the Night Manager. The ledger. The souls in the basement. Then Selene and the Pale Lady, and the baby crying in Aisle 3, and the suit guy outside the glass doors that sticks rules to doors. I told him about the thing I locked in the basement my first night and the human customer who got his head eaten by a kid. About the breathing cans. The other me. All of it. No sugarcoating.

Every rule. Every horror.

By the time I finished, the color had drained from his face.

When I finally paused for breath, he gave a shaky laugh. “Cool. Starting strong.”

I gave him a look.

“Hey, I’m trying,” he said, hands up. “So… reflections stop being yours after 2:17 a.m.? If you look—what? Don’t look away?”

“Keep eye contact,” I said. “It gets worse if you’re the first to break it.”

“And the baby?”

“If you hear crying in Aisle 3, you run. Straight to the loading dock. Lock yourself in for eleven minutes. No more. No less.”

He squinted. “Seriously?”

“You think I’m joking?”

I rattled off the rest.

* The other version of yourself.
* The sky you never look at.
* The aisle that breathes.
* The intercom.
* The bathroom you never enter.
* The smiling man at the door.
* The alarm, and the voice that screams a name you never answer.

And the laminated rules:

* The basement.
* The Pale Man.
* Visitors after two.
* The Pale Lady.
* Don’t burn the store.
* Don’t break a rule.

By the time I finished, he wasn’t laughing anymore.

11:00 p.m.

The air shifted.

It always does.

The hum deepened into a low vibration under my skin. The store exhaled. And just like that, the night began.

Dante followed me out of the break room, hugging his laminated sheet like a Bible.

He was jumpy, but I could see hope in him still—a stupid kind of hope that maybe if he did everything right, this was just another job.

I almost envied him.

2:17 a.m.

So far, the shift had been normal—or as normal as this place ever gets. The Pale Lady had already come and gone. The canned goods aisle was calm, just breathing softly under my whistle. I was restocking drinks when I realized Dante wasn’t humming anymore. Then I saw him—standing in front of the freezer doors, staring at something in the glass. “Dante,” I whispered. “Don’t look away.”

He jumped, about to turn, and I grabbed his arm hard.

“Rule,” I hissed. “You looked at it?”

He nodded, slow. His face was white as the frost on the glass.

“What do you see?”

“…Not me,” he whispered.

His reflection was smiling. Too wide. Its hand pressed against the glass like it wanted to come through.

“Don’t break eye contact,” I said, my voice low and sharp. “No matter what.”

It tapped once on the other side.

A dull, hollow knock.

Its fingertips tapped against the glass again.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

The sound echoed like something hollow inside a skull.

“Don’t blink,” I whispered. “Don’t you dare blink.”

“I can’t—” Dante’s voice cracked.

The reflection tilted its head—wrong, too far—until its ear was almost touching the end of its neck.

Its grin stretched until the corners of its mouth split like paper.

The frost on the inside of the freezer door began to melt around its hand, water streaking down like tears. And then it pressed its face against the glass, smearing cold condensation as it whispered something I couldn’t hear.

Only Dante could hear it. His lips parted, soundless.

“Dante,” I snapped. “Do not answer it.”

The reflection lifted its other hand and placed one finger against the glass. Then another. Then another. Slowly, it spread its palm wide, mirroring his own.

Desperate, I tried one of my old distractions—the same one that had worked once before.

“Siri, play baby crying noises,” I muttered, loud enough for the phone in my pocket to obey.

The wail of a baby filled the aisle.

The reflection didn’t even blink.

It didn’t so much as twitch. Just kept grinning.

The store was learning my tricks.

The reflection’s grin widened, as if it was pleased I’d even tried.

It tilted its head farther—an inhuman angle, vertebrae cracking like breaking ice.

“Remi,” Dante whispered, his voice strangled. “I can’t… move.”

“You don’t need to move,” I said, forcing my voice to stay steady even as cold prickled up my arms. “Just don’t look away. No matter what happens.”

Behind the glass, its lips began to move faster. The words were still silent to me, but I could see them crawling under Dante’s skin, worming their way into his head. His face crumpled like someone had just whispered the worst truth he’d ever heard.

“Dante!” I barked. “Do not listen!”

His pupils blew wide. His breath came in short, sharp bursts.

And then, for just a second, his eyes darted toward me.

It was enough.

The reflection surged. The glass rippled like liquid, hands exploding through and clamping around his neck. 

I lunged, grabbing his hoodie and pulling back with everything I had, but the thing was strong—its strength wasn’t human. Inch by inch, it dragged him forward, half his torso already sinking into the door like it was swallowing him whole.

His arms thrashed wildly, but there was nothing to grab—only that slick, freezing surface. His nails scraped along the tile, leaving white trails.

I could feel his hoodie stretching in my fists, the threads cutting into my palms. Any second it would rip.

The cold radiating from the glass was so intense my knuckles went numb. My breath came out in fog.

And then I saw it—his reflection wasn’t just pulling him in. It was unspooling him.

Pieces of him—thin strands of light, skin, memory—were dragging off him like threads from a sweater, pulling into the glass. “Dante, fight it!” I yelled, bracing my feet on the tile. My palms burned from the ice-cold condensation slicking his clothes.

Inside the glass, the reflection’s face met his.

Teeth too sharp.

Mouth too wide.

Breath frosting over his skin.

“Don’t look at it!” I yelled, yanking harder. “Don’t you dare give it any more!”

But Dante’s eyes were locked on the thing’s. I saw his pupils quiver, like the reflection was tugging at them from the inside. Like he couldn’t look away if he tried.

Then it opened its mouth wider. Too wide.

And I swear, something on the other side started breathing him in.

His scream wasn’t even human anymore—just wet, strangled noise as his throat vanished into that thing’s mouth.

I pulled until my muscles screamed, until black spots filled my vision.

“Let. Him. Go!”

The glass buckled around his chest as it started to suck him through.

And then—

The world stopped.

A cold deeper than ice dropped down my spine, and for a moment it felt like the whole store held its breath.

A voice, calm and level, cut through the hum of the lights like a blade:

“That’s enough.”

The reflection froze mid-motion, mouth hanging open. The glass solidified around Dante like concrete, holding him halfway in and halfway out. He slumped forward, unconscious, as the thing behind the door started writhing, pressing against the ice but unable to move.

The voice came again, unhurried:

“Release him.”

The hands on Dante’s throat started to smoke, like dry ice under sunlight, before they crumbled away into pale fog.

I dragged him out and fell backward with his weight just as the surface of the glass hardened completely, leaving behind only that wide, hungry grin pressed flat and faint behind it.

And then I looked up.

The Night Manager was standing in the aisle, perfectly still, like he’d been watching the entire time.

He closed the distance without a sound.

One second he was standing at the end of the aisle, the next he was right in front of us.

A gloved hand clamped onto Dante’s hoodie. Effortless.

He tore him out of my arms and threw him aside like he weighed nothing. Dante hit the tiles hard, skidding into a shelf, coughing and wheezing like a crushed worm.

The Night Manager didn’t even look at him.

His attention was on me.

“You really do collect strays, don’t you?” His voice was soft—too soft. It made the hum of the lights sound deafening. “First Selene. Now this one.”

“He didn’t know,” I said, my voice trembling. “It was a reflex.”

“Reflex,” he repeated, tasting the word like it was foreign.

His gaze slid to Dante. “Tell me, insect. Did you think the glass was yours to look into?”

Dante tried to speak, but only managed a rasp of air.

The Night Manager crouched, slow and deliberate, until his face was inches from Dante’s.

“You broke a rule,” he whispered. “Do you know what happens to the ones who break them?”

Dante shook his head, tiny, terrified.

“You die,” he said simply. “But tonight… you will not. Do you know why?”

Dante couldn’t answer. Couldn’t even breathe.

The Night Manager straightened, towering over both of us. His eyes found mine again.

“Because,” he said, “I am interested in you, Remi. And I am curious to see if you survive tomorrow.”

He stepped closer, and I had to force myself not to flinch.

“I’m a busy man,” he said, his voice like a cold hand curling around my spine. “I don’t waste time on things that aren’t… promising.”

His gaze slid to Dante—disinterested, dismissive, like he wasn’t worth the oxygen he was using.

“This one?” he said, voice almost bored. “A distraction. Don’t make me clean up after him again.”

He gestured toward Dante like he was pointing at a stain.

“Consider this an act of mercy. That’s why some of you only last a week.”

Then, quieter—deadly:

“Don’t expect mercy again.”

Then his gaze sharpened, cold and surgical.

“And Remi,” he said softly, “Selene has been opening her mouth far too much for someone who abandoned her friends. She made Stacy desperate enough to set fire to my store. That bathroom she’s chained to? That’s no accident. That’s what she earned.”

The way he said it made the tiles feel thinner beneath me.

“She likes to whisper that I’m a barbarian. That I chop. That I burn. That I destroy.”

His head tilted slightly. “But I find eternity far more… elegant. I prefer to keep them here. To trap them. To let them unravel, slowly. That is punishment.”

His lips curved into the faintest suggestion of a smile.

“Since Selene seems to think getting chopped up is a fitting fate, I have decided to let her experience exactly that. Piece by piece. Forever.”

He straightened, his stare pressing down on me like a hand tightening around my throat.

“Don’t mistake me for what she told you,” he said. “And don’t make me deal with you the way I’m dealing with her.”

And then he vanished.

For a moment, there was nothing. No hum from the lights. No breath. Just silence.

Then, like a slow tide, the store exhaled again, and the weight pressing down on me finally lifted.

I ran to Dante. He was still on the floor, pale and shaking so violently I thought his bones might rattle apart.

“Can you move?” I asked.

He nodded weakly, so I helped him sit up. His hoodie was damp with cold sweat.

“What did it say to you?” I whispered.

His eyes flicked toward the cooler doors and back to me. When he spoke, his voice barely rose above a breath.

“It—it was my voice,” he whispered. “But it wasn’t me. It said, ‘Let me out. I’m the one who survives. You don’t have to die in here. Just look away.’”

I tightened my grip on his arm. “And you almost did?”

“I don’t know,” he said, shaking his head over and over. “I thought if I turned around, I’d see you. Not… that thing.”

I swallowed hard. “Listen to me, Dante. Don’t ever listen to anything in this place. Not if it sounds like me. Not if it sounds like you. Understand?”

He nodded again, but the look on his face told me he hadn’t processed a word. His hands were shaking too badly to wipe his own eyes.

I got him to the breakroom, sat him down, and stayed there with him while he broke down—silent, helpless tears running down his face. I didn’t say much. There wasn’t anything to say. I just sat there, keeping watch as he cried, counting the seconds until the store finally loosened its grip on us.

The breakroom clock ticked too loud.

We didn’t talk after that. Not much, anyway. Dante kept his eyes on the floor, flinching every time the overhead lights buzzed too long between flickers. He was pale and jumpy, wrung out and folded in on himself like a crumpled page.

I stayed with him. I didn’t know what else to do.

When the store got quiet again—*too* quiet—I checked the time.

5:51 a.m.

Nine more minutes.

I stood slowly. “It’s almost over.”

Dante looked up at me, his face hollow. “Does it ever end, though? Really?”

I didn’t answer. We both already knew.

The lights pulsed once, then settled. A soft metallic *ding* sounded somewhere near the front registers, like a cashier’s bell from a world that didn’t belong here anymore.

“Come on,” I said gently. “We walk out together.”

We moved in silence through the aisles. The store, for once, didn’t fight us. No whispers from the canned goods. No flickering shadows. Not even the breathing from behind the freezers.

Just quiet. Still and waiting.

The five fingerprints on my shoulder pulsed with heat as we stepped out into the parking lot. The air out here didn’t feel clean—it felt like something the store had *allowed* us to breathe.

Dante stopped at his motorcycle. He didn’t mount it right away.

“Survive, Remi,” he said softly. “You need to survive.”

He hugged me. It was quick, desperate—like he thought this would be the last time.

Then he pulled back and added, “Thank you… for saving me.”

I didn’t know what to say. So I just nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat.

He swung onto his bike, kicked it to life, and rolled out into the pale morning haze.

I watched until his tail light disappeared behind the trees.

Then I got into my car.

The Night Manager’s voice echoed in my skull, smooth and cold, like something ancient slithering through the wires of the store. He didn’t just appear there—he *was* the store. Every flickering light, every warped tile, every shadow that moved when it shouldn’t.

My shoulder burned hotter now. The handprint wasn’t just a bruise anymore—it was a brand, alive beneath my skin, syncing with my pulse like it was counting down to something.

Tomorrow was the evaluation. And I was already marked.

So if you ever visit Evergrove Market, don’t look at the freezer doors. Not even for a second.

Some things don’t like being seen.
