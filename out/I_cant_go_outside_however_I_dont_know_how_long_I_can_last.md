It all happened in a matter of days, first came loud sirens hollering from across town, people scurrying to secure as much supplies as needed, then came the unending silence. I'm not sure what's out there but what every radio station and television channel was telling you, was to stay put and don't make a sound. That was 2 days ago, now what follows is sickening silence through the transmissions. Every couple hours I'd hear something whooshing by. It sounds like one of those blackbird jets, going by just as fast as it arrived. Some sinking feeling in me however is terrified to think it could be something else entirely. My fridge fortunately was fairly stocked before the crisis, unfortunately the powers been out for the last 5 hours. The silent yet now loud hum that comes from the washing machine is soothing as it's ever been, I haven't been in there for days. It's so lonely just having myself and my thoughts so occasionally I'll pull a book off my shelf and read through it to pass the time. My reading was cut short this time once I had noticed a small tear in the sheets of cardboard, canvassing the window of my kitchen, which was filled to the brim with empty dishes placed neatly as to make minimal noise. The news broadcasts advised on covering 

every entry point to the outside, windows very much included. The thought of what could be out there in the silent breeze terrifies me. I grabbed a sheet of newspaper to cover the entry of sunlight into my kitchen. Once it reached a week still the silence wouldn't waver. I gambled going outside but 
I couldn't be that stupid but it's as if I'm drawn to whatever's out there. Curiosity killed the cat, i'd rather stay curious than suffer what's to be found 
out there. The gamble was not just limited to outside. That humming sound it felt loud but once I really focused on it, it was quiet. I kept my distance almost as if I was too afraid to enter the laundry room. I was aware of a windowsill overseeing the laundry room to the right of the dryer.
When the crisis happened I neglected the room as if to seal it off and never go in there again. Why do I feel drawn to it? My mind feels fine but my body has a mind of its own. Once I came to, I was already practically turning the doorknob. The room went silent. It was silent,
the noise that i'm so familiar with being the washing machine hum wasn't sounding. It was never sounding to begin with. The noise was coming from the window, looking down on me. The hum got louder. something spotted me. Whatever had spotted me has begun humming it’s been getting louder. I don’t know how much longer I can take it. More are coming as it continues to get louder and louder and louder and louder.
