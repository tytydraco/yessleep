Most of what we serve is on draught. Lager or ale, though the regulars insist on calling the latter *‘beer’*—like I’m supposed to care. I’m a nineteen-year-old history student, not a crusty old barfly. Do they think I care about using the correct term to refer to their dancing juice? I’ve worked at The Opal Pendant pub for a month, and I’m already sick of the tedium. Functioning alcoholics. The smell of spilt drinks. Fridges that buzz too loud. The glasswasher’s rumble. It can get busy on the weekends. But midweek? In the off-season? Nope. It’s just me and the regulars. 

“I’ll have another one, boy,” Colin said. He’s an Irishman who openly admits to living in a tent by the river.

“Alright.”

I bent for an empty pint glass, tilted it beneath the tap, and pulled the lever. A stream of russet liquid began to fill it, and I held the pose, squinting. Pulling pints can make you feel like you’re on a stage sometimes. It’s an act that draws eyes, even when the mind is elsewhere. Added to that was the curiosity of watching the new guy behind the bar. Pint poured, I handed the drink to Colin under the surveillance of covetous eyes.

“Three-seventy, please.” I said. He pulled out a blue plastic bag filled with coins and delved into it, grubby fingers shaking. He fished four out.

“Here you go, boy. Say, would you mind giving me a top up? Head’s a tad big.”

They can be very prissy about their beer, I’ve learned. Fingernail hygiene or liver vitality may not matter a great deal to a Pendant regular, but value for money of their primary vice does. The creamy layer at the top of Colin’s pint was a centimetre beyond the ‘fingers-width’ I’d been told to leave by the landlady herself, Ally. A rebuttal nearly escaped my lips, but then I remembered her advice:

*“There’s three or four who are the lifeblood of The Pendant in the off-season. They’ll turn up every night and drink seven or eight pints a-piece. As much as they might wind you up, do try to keep them happy as best you can, love.”* 

“No problem.” I said, giving Colin his change and returning to the ale tap with his pint. Hoarse laughter erupted from the other side of the bar, slicing through the quiet. 

“You serve pints, not ice creams, lad!” a man with huge ears and tufts of hair protruding from each nostril said. 

I blushed. The heckler’s name is Pete, and he’s a paint-stained-work-overall-wearing lager guzzler who laughs at his own jokes. His wife, June, accompanies him to The Pendant, matching his pints with halves for herself. She purrs along to his japes from her barstool, stroking his arm and instigating the occasional public display of affection.

“Leave the boy be. He’s doing his best.” Colin said as I handed back the topped-up pint. 

“He knows I’m joking! Don’t you, lad?” Pete said in his gravelly voice.

I nodded and leaned back on the counter, wishing the next three hours of evening away. Raindrops dribbled down the slanted windows, sometimes racing, sometimes stalling. Stout wooden beams criss-crossed above, and a deer’s head stared blankly from its wall-mount. Gold-rimmed frames displayed portraits of Victorian-era aristocrats. I’d been trying to work out if they were specific people or just generic. Generic, probably. Originals or copies? Copies. 

I’m studying in one of those British cities that was in its bloated pomp hundreds of years ago, and like an estuary at low tide, the waters of its significance had receded. What remains are cobbled streets, a grandiose church, a leafy riverfront and places like The Opal Pendant, which try to transport gullible tourists backwards in time. The name holds a certain mystique for them because it isn’t your average ‘*Dog and Duck’* or ‘*Red Lion*’. Outside, above the door, hangs a creaky sign depicting a lavish necklace resting on a cushion. The chain slithers in lazy curves along the cushion to the opal itself, which leans forward on its bottom edge. To my eye, the place the artist has painted on an exaggerated gleam gives the impression that the jewel is winking. Like it knows something that the passerby doesn’t.

The door handle rattled. Stopped. Rattled again. Then flew open, smashing into the wall. A drenched couple walked in and fought to shut out the gale. 

“Bloody ‘ell. Door’s closed then!” Pete exclaimed, causing June to giggle.

“Sorry about that. Is this The Opal Pendant, by any chance?” One of them asked.

I went to answer, but before I could respond, Pete was motoring away again.

“It is, aye!”

“Great!”

I served them while Pete kept them in a conversational stranglehold. He strode out from his perch to show them the flood chart, wincing all the while at a protesting joint.

“This wooden chart has the water level recorded inside The Pendant since 1874, when its been flooded, that is. You can see it almost reached the ceiling there in 2021.”

“The water was that high? In here? You’re telling me all this was underwater?”

“Absolutely. It’s heartbreaking when it floods. It really is. Such an old building and all. Listed. I get upset because it means me and June have to go drink somewhere else, ain’t that right, Juney?”

“Well, we come here even if it’s wet.” She said.

Pete burst into laughter again, revealing his stained teeth. The tourists smiled politely and wandered the room as he harangued them with Pendant trivia. They didn’t stay for a second drink.

“They were friendly.” Pete said, returning to his berth beside June. She smiled and patted his thigh. 

“Another one please, boy.”

I poured Colin’s pint and took payment, careful not to make contact with his unsanitary palm. The more he drank, the longer his pale eyes lingered on things. It was unsettling, but I preferred standing by him and pretending to be busy if it meant I could avoid Pete and June. 

“All that about the flood chart and he didn’t even mention the gods-be-damned necklace.” Colin said.

“Necklace?” I asked.

Footsteps could be heard crossing a room overhead, then descending behind the bar. Colin fixed me with a blank look. 

“Never mind.” He said.

Ally stepped out from the upstairs flat wearing fluffy pyjamas, her dark hair in a loose knot. Wrinkles creased around her eyes as she smiled by way of greeting. 

“Ally, my darling!” Pete bellowed, throwing his arms wide. 

“Hello, you. Hope you haven’t been causing trouble.” Ally said. 

“Me? Trouble? Never!”

“Come on then. Out with ya. It’s shutting up time.”

“Party pooper Ally! Never changes, does it?” 

“You know the drill by now, Pete.” She turned to me. “Everything go OK tonight?”

“Yeah. All quiet.” I said.

“Good. Get yourself home.”

I retrieved my raincoat and went back over to the bar to say goodbye. Pete and June had left, but Ally and Colin were still there. The landlady used a calculator by the till and counted coins while Colin tapped a finger on the polished wood of the bar. I said goodbye and pulled my hood up, marching out into the blustery night. It was a straight ride along the river to get back to my dorm. I untied my bike and pointed it in the direction of home. Well-lit. Smooth tarmac. Off-road. Lovely. 

My shift was over and this summer squall wasn’t going to dampen my spirits. The only quirk on my route was a green tent standing behind a copse of trees about a kilometre along the path. I went to push off and saw Colin walking behind, carrying a bulging blue bag that jangled as though it were full of coins. Eerily like coins, actually. But it couldn’t be. He’d gone through all of his money. The coins had gone directly from his bag to the till, via me, all night. Now he was walking home, leathered, with a bag full of god-knows-what. Then it clicked. The tent. Colin lived there! As gross as the guy was, I was in a good mood, so I waved him over. Thankfully, the wind adequately dispersed his body odour. 

“Hey, Colin! Mind if I walk with you? You’re in that green tent, right?”

“I am, boy! That’d be no problem at all.”

I stepped off my bike and wheeled it beside him. 

“Wild night to be in a tent, isn’t it?” I said.

“Ah, it’s not so bad as you might think. And I’ll sleep like the dead soon as my head hits the pillow. That’s what a skinful’ll do for you.”

He had a strange, hobbly walk, and I could see water dripping from the end of his bulbous nose. 

“How long have you been drinking in The Opal Pendant, Colin?”

“Good few years, could be eight. Longer than that loudmouth idiot.”

“Pete?”

He grunted. “All that garbage he spouts, but he knows nothin’. Nothin’! Twas only right that I showed him the… never mind.”

“The necklace?” I asked, and Colin’s sunken eyes caught mine in a glance that wasn’t vacant at all. A pause lengthened between us.

“Aye. The Opal Pendant, that’s what I mean.”

“*The* Opal Pendant. You have the one the pub is named after? Why didn’t you or Pete mention it to the tourists?”

“I’ll show it to you, and then you’ll understand. It’s only in my tent, just there.” He pointed to the slouching canvas abode, not a hundred yards away. We pushed through wet leaves and branches to come to his campsite. The tent flap had been left open, which sent Colin growling and cursing after he’d launched his jangly blue bag inside. I kicked at fallen leaves while he waded through newspapers and bottles and muddy clothing. He crawled out of view and I thought I’d better give him some space. I looked over at the street-lit path through the undergrowth and listened to the patter of rain as my mind ran drunk on curiosity.

“Are you sure you have the actual pendant? The real one?” I asked.

“Oh aye, Ally gave it to me. We have an agreement of sorts. One minute, boy, it’s here somewhere. Cursed thing!” Colin said, voice obscured by shuddering canvas and keening wind.

“How old is it?”

“I don’t know, truth be told.”

I thought about leaving him be. What was I doing hanging around with homeless people at night in the rain? He clearly didn’t have his shit together, and here I was, stressing him out more. I began to slide away, but cut a deal with myself to wait a bit longer. I have the stubborn streak of a researcher who feels they are on the cusp of making a discovery. Just a little longer delving through the archives and I’ll have milked all the sources dry. My insatiable desire to understand things. I think that’s what led me to wait around.

“Colin?”

“I have it! I have it, boy! Why don’t you come in and hunker down out of the wet? I’ll show it to you. The Opal Pendant.”

I was aware of the lusty tone that entered his voice, but put it down to inebriation. Any more alarm bells and I’d have been out of there, lickety-split. I crouched in the entrance and by the weak light of a dangling torch, I saw it. A beautiful pendant dangling on a chain that seemed to shift between silver, chrome and gold. The opal itself was a heartstopping red that housed an intricate design within. It dragged my focus around like a matador gored by a bull. I was helpless.

What I didn’t notice was the reeking smell of stale sweat and slug colonies living on the interior tent walls. I didn’t see the stacks of papers covered in a spidery, capitalised font that sloughed over into a puddle. I didn’t see the man’s body curled along the foul floor, cobra-like, moisture steaming off his balding head, grey eyebrows arched together, eyes boiling blue and fixed upon me. All I saw was the jewel, and then it began to swing.

“Do you see the opal, boy? Do you see it well?”

“Yes.” I said.

“I’m going to keep swinging it and you’re going to keep watching, OK?”

“OK.”

“Pretty isn’t it? Good. It’ll swing five more times left to right, starting now. I want you to keep watching it, and when it’s done, you’ll go deeper, OK?”

“What’s happening?” I said, not recognising the tone of my voice.

“You’re just looking at the necklace, boy. Have no fear. Three, two, one, and… ***down***.”

I went into the nebulous framework of the the opal and found myself observing the different nodes with fascination. Shimmering planes of red, so perfect it was beyond belief. There was a pleasant ringing in my ears of the most soothing frequency. The opal beckoned me in further and I experienced a euphoric rush of gratitude, straight to the head, booming to the rhythm of my heartbeat. Everything was warm and welcoming, everywhere I looked. This was the kind of place where I could pass time comfortably, or time could pass me.

“It’ll swing five more times, starting now, then you’ll go *even* deeper. After that point, you’ll accept a new habit of my choosing as payment for showing you the necklace. I think that’s a reasonable bargain. That’s what was agreed with the other Pendant regulars, anyhow. Ordinarily, like with that oaf, Peter, I’d have them forget this interaction, but Ally had an idea for this one. We enjoy experimentation, you see, so I’m not going to erase your memory. Ally wants to watch you become a loyal customer at The Opal Pendant, drinking yourself into an early grave, all while you know that you’re doing it. And our pockets will become lovely and lined in the process. Oh, I think so, boy. I really do think so. Now, wait to hear my instruction, then begone from my tent, go home and sleep soundly til the morning. Three, two, one, and… ***down***.”

I woke up and texted Ally to say that I won’t be coming back to The Opal Pendant. I quit. I thought about going to the police or confronting Colin down at his tent by the river. In the end, I resolved to wait. To show a bit of patience. Talk it through with friends when I feel ready. 

That day I went about my business. Two lectures went by with no issue and I could concentrate fine. I went to the library, opened my laptop and wrote a couple of hundred words for an upcoming assignment. Saw friends. Had a coffee. It was around five o’clock when things started to go wrong. 

I was walking home from campus when I felt a tingle in my legs. My thighs and calves twitched uncontrollably, and took me away from the path in cartoonish steps. Resistance to the muscle spasms only brought blinding pain and a wobbliness that attracted unwanted attention. I tried to walk a different way home, but when I turned to go down an alleyway, I had the same problem. Beside the path was a flat-roofed building with barred windows that was so ordinary, I’d never noticed it before. Now I gripped the bars for dear life, hooking the crook of my arms around them in a vice grip. Still my legs insisted I walk. They churned up the dirt below the window, kicking and thrashing at stinging nettles and weeds and gravel. Sweat trickled down my temples and into my eyes at the pain of the wrought iron digging into my skin. 

I was startled when an elderly woman asked if I was OK. Between grunts, I told her that this happened sometimes. It’d pass. I waited for her to round the corner before finally letting go of the bars. Deep bruises had formed in the folds of my arms from that hellish embrace. I was hyperventilating and whimpering from the pain, but the magnetism was insistent. It drew me into the city centre. Along with the disobedience of my limbs came a growing picture in my mind's eye of The Opal Pendant. Other thoughts fell to the periphery until the pub was all I could think about. Troubling thoughts are hard to dislodge at the best of times, but this was something else. Something all-consuming. 

Powerless to withstand the suggestion, I drifted in a daze to the front door of The Opal Pendant and opened it. I inhaled a noxious perfume of bad breath, alcohol, cleaning products and worn upholstery. In front of me were the gleaming tap heads, and Ally standing behind them. Colin sat on a barstool, halfway through his pint. He patted the cracked magenta cushion of a neighbouring seat, and my legs carried me there. I climbed up, sat down and numb hands withdrew my wallet. 

“A beer, please.” My voice said.

“Looks like I work for you now, love.” Ally said, smirking before turning away to operate the till.

My muscles allowed me to look at Colin. His even gaze confirmed what I thought I knew. This sour-smelling man with filth packed under his fingernails had planted a habit deep within me. Hypnotised by The Opal Pendant, I’d become a slave. All the money he put into the till, Ally gave him back at the end of the night. That’s what I had witnessed the night before. The jangly blue bag. That was their arrangement. He leaned in close. 

“It’s us regulars that keep this place afloat, boy,” said Colin.
