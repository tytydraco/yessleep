So, the title may sound like some meta joke or something. I assure you it isn’t. I have no other way to describe it, but I need to try and explain. My brothers and I were playing football on South Beach when Aiden, second oldest, kicked it way too hard causing it to soar to the other side of a decaying pier. Being the youngest, I was obviously sent to retrieve it. I ran around the pier and had just moved out of sight of them when I found it. 

It wasn’t so much a thing as the absence of a thing. A black box that juddered in position slightly as I moved, like when they put a censor bar over a person's face on tv. The box seemed to grow as I got closer, as the object it obscured took up more of my vision. I took a slow circle around the redacted, trying to see behind it. No matter how I moved around, the box remained. It was about one foot square, best guess when I was close and always seemed flat. Like I’d be able to peek overtop and see behind it, if only it didn’t constantly tilt and move to prevent me. It made me feel sick to look at, but I struggled to take my eyes off it.

“Oi, dick cheese, where’s the ball?” Cole, my eldest brother, called. 

“It's...” I glanced around. The ball was still twenty feet away. “I found something.”

“What?” Cole called.

“Dunno.”

“what you mean ‘dunno?” Aiden said, running around the pier towards me. The black box started to shudder more as if in response. I held up my hands to warn Aiden off. I didn’t know what it was or why it was doing it, but I couldn’t fathom a situation where it ended well. 

“Fuck is that?” Aiden asked when he finally clocked what I was standing by. He had stopped and was now standing bolt upright staring at it. Then his face started to crease and quaver. I’d only seen him cry, properly cry, once before when his first girlfriend had dumped him by text. He looked much the same. He was staring at the box but...but he wasn’t seeing the box, I realised. He was seeing whatever was really there. 

“What is it? What can you see?” I asked, taking a step back from the redacted, finally realising how stupid it was to be so close to something like that. 

“I don’t understand. It's-" Whatever else he said I didn’t hear. His voice was masked by a continuous beep, like they use to censor swear words pre-watershed. The beeping finally ended as Aiden stopped talking and broke down into uncontrollable sobbing. I was completely out of my depth. After what seemed like an eternity of inaction I finally settled on the safest course of action. I yelled for Cole. 

“Cole!”

“No!” Aiden gasped through the tears. “Don’t let-" Then his head exploded. 

Aiden, my brother, who had helped me beat devil Kazuya in tekken 8, who taught me the mnemonic to remember the colours of the rainbow, who didn’t tell our parents when he caught me vaping. One moment he was staring at me through misty eyes, his face scrunched with the importance of what he was trying to say. The next his head split open like a pizza placed on top of a firecracker. He didn’t even have time to look surprised. Flecks of pink and red and white flew in all directions, bombarding me and disappearing behind the redacted. I felt a sharp pain in my cheek as something connected but I was more focused on the sand. 

The remnants of my brother’s head that had passed behind the redacted and come out the other side had splashed in the sand, leaving a negative space image of whatever the redaction hid. It was like a Rorschach test. The pattern was imprisoning. I couldn’t turn away. My eyes would cast over and catch on a whorl at the edge which pulled my vision inexorably back to the centre. It baked in the hot sun, smelling like black pudding too long on the grill. I wretched and vomited. Unable to move, the vomit filled my mouth before the pressure caused it to spew forth down my chin and mercifully over the pattern. The ghastly spell broke and I ran. 

I slammed into Cole almost as soon as I passed the pier, bowling him over despite being half his size. I grabbed hold of him as we fell, needing the comfort of family, and began wailing. I had never displayed anything close to that kind of sentiment before, so it was hardly surprising that Cole almost immediately wrestled himself loose. 

“You gone soft in the head?” Cole asked, wiping away any trace of the physical interaction. “Is this...is this vomit?” He asked as his hand made contact with a transfer of my sick on his vest. 

“H-H-He’s dead!” I blubbered, still sobbing. Cole wasn't paying any attention, instead focusing on trying to wipe the sick off using sand. I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him. He needed to understand. “Aiden is dead!” 

He finally stopped and looked at me. His eyes full of frustration. “Who the fuck is Aiden?”

“He's...” I began, but I couldn’t continue. Who was Aiden? It had meant so much that he had died, but now I couldn’t even recall knowing anyone by that name. I glanced back at where I was sure something had happened beyond the pier. There was nothing. Just an empty stretch of beach and a football.

“You’re so god damn weird. Get the ball and let’s go. Dad just called, he got the reservation wrong and is coming to pick us up.” Cole said. I nodded and rushed to grab the ball. My head pounded as I ran, desperate to recall things that should have been there. I grabbed the ball and we headed to the spot Dad had said he’d meet us. 

The ride to the hotel was quiet, at least for me. Cole sat up front talking to Dad about the news, while I sat in the back, staring at the football in my lap, deep in thought. My cheek ached and I felt cold and numb despite the heat. Something awful had happened I was sure, but I couldn’t remember what. I turned the ball over in my hands even as my mind spun and it tried to find what it had lost. 

Back at the hotel room Mum was already wearing her blue dress, the one she saved for special occasions, her hair that deep auburn the same as his. I jolted, unsure who I had been thinking of. 

“Dinner is in an hour, so hurry up and get dressed.” She said, fumbling to put earrings in. Cole had gone to our room to use the shower there, while I used this one. I headed to the bathroom and turned on the shower, catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror above the sink. Something small and white was protruding from my cheek. I leaned closer to the mirror before attempting to pull it out. It stung, but came out easily enough. It was barely a centimetre long, thin, and bone white. Bone. As I held it everything came rushing back to me and I threw up in the sink. 

“You ok in there?” Dad asked. 

“Yeah, I’m- yeah.” I managed. I washed out my mouth and quickly showered; I could feel the memories fading. By the time I turned the shower off, I could barely remember him again. In the main room Mum was gone and Dad was putting on cufflinks. He gestured to the bed, where my suit lay.

“Grabbed it for you from next door. Hurry it up champ, we need to leave" He checked his wrist “five minutes ago.” He wasn’t wearing a watch. It was a bit he always did. I smiled wanly and hurriedly got dressed, only stopping when I got to my tie.

“Dad?” I asked, trying to keep my tone level. 

“Need help with the tie?” 

“No, it’s not that. Do you remember Aiden?” I asked. I wondered what would be better. If he had completely forgotten his now-dead son, or if he remembered him and hadn’t cared enough to ask why he wasn’t there. 

“Uh, is that someone at your school?” 

“No, he’s...it doesn’t matter.” The words burned my soul. Of course it mattered. He mattered. Even if no one remembered him but me. 

“OK, you can catch me up later, because we have gotta go.” He said, tying his shoelaces. He wrapped an arm around my shoulder and guided me out the door. We made our way downstairs and regrouped with Mum and Cole. Mum went all watery-eyed.

“Oh, my three handsome gentlemen.” She pulled Cole and I into a hug. Cole, who felt too old for such displays of affection from his mother especially in public tried to extricate himself. I hugged her tighter and wept, thinking of Aiden. 

We made it to the restaurant barely ten minutes late and were thankfully shown straight to a table. It was one of those fancy restaurants with beige walls turned a soft yellow from a hundred lamps designed to mimic candlelight. As we were guided to our table another waitress hurriedly pulled an extra set of cutlery and a chair away. We sat down and the waiter looked over to me and Cole.

“So, which of you is the birthday boy?” He asked. My parents glanced at each other in confusion and I felt a chasm in my stomach. Of course today was his birthday. 

“Neither of us.” Cole said. The waiter quickly hid a look of surprise.

“What is the special occasion this fine evening?”

“Oh, it’s-" Mum began but cut off, her mouth working to finish but her brain providing no further information.

“Just a family meal while we’re on holiday.” Dad said with a smile, rescuing her. He leaned over and gave her a peck on the forehead and she squeezed his hand reassuringly. 

“Very good, very good! And a happy holiday for you all I hope it is.” The waiter smiled as though this wasn’t the most uncomfortable conversation. He gave us our menus and bowed. “I will be back to take your drinks order shortly.” 

Having recovered from the embarrassment, my family settled into the same chit chat we always had at dinner. I reserved myself to short answers and didn’t follow up with anything. My stomach, which hadn’t felt right since the beach, was beginning to roil. The lights seemed to recede and the buzzing from them overwhelmed my ears. It felt as though the room had expanded to a great desert where my family were miles away from me and simultaneously I was caught in a box so small my chest couldn’t expand for me to breathe. The tightness grew until my ribs nearly collapsed and I sprang up from my seat just to prove I could still move.

“I need to use the bathroom.” I said, before making my way to the toilets. From the way heads turned at other tables as I passed I must have made a scene. The glares followed me, pricking into my back and burning my stomach until I was finally able to shut the door and cut them off. 

I rushed to a cubicle and bent over it, preparing for the flood of sick that must have been coming. But it didn’t. I took deep breaths, trying not to think about how close my head was to a public toilet. My stomach settled and I stepped out of the cubicle to the row of basins. In the mirror my face looked deathly pale with a pinprick of red where a piece of Aiden's skull had stabbed me. And there, in the corner of the bathroom, hovering over a urinal, was a black box. My hands clenched the sides of the basin and I squeezed my eyes shut until I could hear rushing in my ears and desperately wished the redacted away. But when I opened my eyes, it was still there. I don’t know how long I stood like that staring at it before the door opened. It was Cole. 

“You’ve been in here like half an hour, what’s- what’s wrong with you?” He asked, his voice changing from annoyance to something approaching concern when he saw my face. 

“I'm fine.” I said. I knew I didn’t sound convincing, but I had to get him out of the bathroom before he saw it. “Come on, let’s head back.” I stood up straight and moved towards the door. As I did, the redacted must have moved into his view. His eyes went wide. He’d seen it.

“Cole, don’t look at it.” I begged. “C'mon, let’s get back to the table.” I grabbed him by the shoulder and tried to turn him around; I would have had more luck moving a wall. 

“It wants you.” He said. “It wants you to-" His voice cut off as that horrific beep sounded again, like nails being twisted slowly into my eardrums. The sound stopped and all was dreadfully quiet. 

“Save yourself.” Cole said. He placed a hand on my arm and squeezed once. Then his head popped. Like a balloon full of spaghetti and teeth. I stumbled back as it stung my eyes and the coppery taste filled my mouth. Cole's body collapsed like a marionette with its strings cut and I fell after him. I grabbed his headless body and held it close to me, desperate for it not to disappear like Aiden’s. Desperate not to forget him. Cole. My eldest brother. He beat up Stevey cross-eyes when he started bullying me. He told me how to pronounce the difficult words when I’d started reading game of thrones after Dad said I wasn’t old enough to watch it. He’d known he was about to die and tried to console me. 

The door swung open again after what felt like an eternity and I glanced up from the remains of Cole's body to find my Dad standing there, a look of concern written on his face. 

“You ok, son?” He said. That’s when I realised the tension in my arms from supporting Cole had vanished. I looked down, knowing what I’d find. What I wouldn’t find. I was kneeling alone in a restaurant bathroom crying. 

“I don’t know what’s happening.” I cried, the words barely audible as my throat dried and contracted. 

“Hey, it’s ok, champ, it’s ok.” Dad consoled, kneeling down with me and hugging me tightly. “You’re at a difficult time in life. I remember bursting into tears watching DuckTales when I was your age.” He helped me to my feet and took my head in his hands, a reassuring smile on his face. I managed a weak nod.

“Yeah. Yeah.” I said. He stayed with me and patted my back while I washed my face and calmed down. We walked back to the table together, Mum quirking a worried eyebrow. Dad patted me on the back one last time before leaning to whisper in her ear. When he had, Mum leaned forward and took my hand in both of hers, but said nothing. A waitress came to take our drink orders and Dad asked if she wouldn’t mind clearing the empty place setting. Cole’s place setting. She apologised and did so. Mum wondered why they’d given such a large table just for three people and I almost broke down again. 

It’s been almost a week since I saw the redacted. Since it took my brothers. I have nightmares of those shapes in the sand. I start awake in the night and stare at the empty bed opposite mine. My parents don’t understand why they put it there in the first place let alone why I want to keep it. Or why I don’t want to move into the larger ‘spare’ bedroom. It’s just a matter of time until it comes back. Until it takes someone else.
