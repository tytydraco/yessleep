I'll start this story by saying I really needed a place to live.

And not like the "*I want the new iPhone*" kind of need—more like the "*I live in my car and shower at a gym*" kind.

I'm telling you this so you won’t find it weird that I was willing to rent any place available—the cheaper, the better.

All my income came from driving for a rideshare app, and, as you can guess, it barely covered the basics.

So when I saw a listing for a tiny apartment well below market price and not too far from downtown, I jumped on it as fast as I could.

I scheduled a visit and showed up at the door by 8 a.m. the next morning.

The building looked like it was from the 70s, not well maintained, and I’m pretty sure I saw a rat near the stairwell. But honestly, I wasn’t in a position to complain.

The landlord was a short, middle-aged woman with gray hair and naturally bulging eyes. She also walked with a limp. There was something unsettling about her presence, though she tried to come off as friendly.

The place was a tiny one-room studio that had been added onto her own apartment, like a separate unit, sharing only a few air vents in the wall between the two. It was cramped, and the bed looked like it had been there since the building was put up. The toilet was broken and the window was jammed.

I loved it. Definitely an upgrade from my nissan.

I made an offer on the spot—15% below the already low asking price—and to my surprise, she accepted immediately.

"You can move in right away," she said slowly with a crooked half-smile.

And that’s what I did.

I finally had a place to call home. She even told me I didn’t need to sign anything at the moment.

\*\*\*

She gave me the keys, and I spent the afternoon fixing the toilet and cleaning out the cobwebs and dust. I couldn’t figure out the window, though.

I took my first shower under my new roof—so happy I could have cried—then got ready for bed on that old mattress, now covered with sheets I’d stolen from my parents’ house a few years ago.

Lying there, even though the bed was stiff, I felt good about myself. Like things were finally turning around… except for the smell.

I couldn’t explain it, but a sour, irritating odor began to fill the apartment.

Checking every corner, I couldn’t find anything that would cause it. I decided to head to a store nearby and buy an air freshener. It worked.

I fell asleep like a rock, exhausted from the day’s work, but woke up sometime in the middle of the night because of a noise I first thought was a neighbor moving stuff.

I took the opportunity to take a leak and went back to bed. And just as I settled in, I heard it again—this time from the wall, near the air vent. Something moved in there, I was sure of it, then it stopped.

Thought it was a rat. Not great, but manageable.

Just as I was about to fall asleep again, I heard it once more.

And this time I knew exactly where to look: the air vent.

From my bed in the dark, staring through the white slats of the vent, I could clearly see two white points.

Eyes. They looked like eyes.

I jumped out of bed and flipped on the light—and they were gone. No sound followed.

"Am I hallucinating?" That was the first thought that crossed my mind.

I tried to get back to sleep but couldn’t fully relax.

My brain kept circling back to one strange detail. Those eyes-things I saw... they looked just like the landlord’s. Bulging.

\*\*\*

The following morning, I was still unsettled.

How could it be her? She was barely 5'4", and the air vent was near the ceiling—at least 7 feet up. Could she have used a ladder or something?

Then I realized I didn’t really know anything about her. She’d only given me her first name, and since we never signed a formal lease, I had no records of her at all.

To be safe, I figured I should learn more. And I knew exactly who could help me—the best tech-savvy person I knew.

I called her and explained what I needed.

“Uncle, you know I’m thirteen, right?” a voice said from the other end. “And I’m literally at school right now. I have to hang up.”

“Come on, Gina, help me out here,” I pleaded. “You probably know a site or two where you can look someone up.”

“It doesn’t help that you don’t even know her full name,” she pointed out, with the sound of kids playing in the background. “Can you at least give me the full address? Maybe I can find something from that.”

“Yes, I can! I’ll send it to you right away.”

“Uncle, one more thing… my mom was wondering the other night if you were coming for grandpa’s birthday this year,” she added, hesitating. “He’d be really happy, you know.”

“I’ll think about it,” I dodged, a bit embarrassed. “Thanks again, Gina. You’re the best.”

I hung up and got ready for work. That rancid smell now lingered in every corner of the house, and it was seriously testing my patience.

I stormed out of the place, grabbing the doorknob and yanking it open—only to find the landlord standing right there, as if she’d been waiting. Or listening. God knows for how long.

I froze. She gave me that crooked smile again—like someone trying to remember how smiling works.

“How are you liking your stay?” she asked.

“It’s very cozy, and I already feel at home,” I lied, my voice catching up from the scare. “There’s just this smell I can’t figure out.”

I invited her in and pointed it out. She told me that a couple lives in the unit above mine, and apparently a pipe had burst—that’s what’s causing the smell. It was being repaired as we speak.

“Should be gone by tomorrow,” she explained, her eyes darting around the studio as she spoke.

I thanked her and left. But I didn’t buy it.

As I was exiting the building, the janitor was handling some mail by the entrance. I asked if he knew the couple who lives above my unit.

He told me no one had lived there for almost a year.

That day’s work was long and exhausting, but it distracted me for a while. Still, between rides, I kept checking my phone to see if Gina had found anything. She kept replying she could only dig deeper after her swim lesson.

I ate a hot dog for dinner and headed home.

Even before I opened the door, I could already smell it. The stench was now so thick and putrid it had seeped into the hallway.

It was overwhelming. I ran straight to the bathroom and threw up.

There was no way I could sleep here tonight. I just wanted to go back to my car.

But its intensity made it easy to trace the smell. It came from the bed.

I stripped the sheets off to investigate. The mattress was filthy, battered—probably a few decades old. I found a seam and started working it open, trying to figure out what was inside.

Just as I was digging in, my phone rang. It was Gina. I picked up and held it to my ear while still probing the mattress.

"Hi, Uncle," she said as I reached further into the foam. "I think I found some info about your landlord through the property records."

"So… anything interesting?"

"Not really. Just a former accountant and widower. He retired about five years ago."

"He?" I asked—and at that exact moment, my fingers gripped something strange and pulled it out.

It was an ear. Brown from rotting.

My face went pale. I just stared at it, frozen.

"Yeah," Gina continued, unaware. "Mr. Garcia. He owns the apartment you live in."

I didn’t respond. I felt something else and tore further into the mattress.

And there it was. Half a head, which I assumed was where the ear had come from.

An older man’s head—mustached, its skin gray and sunken. There were clear bite marks in what was left of his face and neck.

As I held it in my hands, something in me told me this probably was Mr. Garcia.

But then who the hell is that woman?

While I was catching my breath to answer Gina, I heard a knock on the door.

\*\*\*

“Uncle?” Gina said on the other end, concerned by my silence.

The knock grew louder.

I stayed quiet. Maybe she would leave. And it did stop—for a second.

“Hey, Gina,” I whispered cautiously. “Call the police. Right now.”

The knock came back—less a knock this time and more a slam, like someone was trying to break the door down.

“What? What do you mean the po—”

“Call them, Gina! Now!” I shouted into the phone.

At that moment, the door gave in. A heavy slam sent the doorknob flying across the room. I dropped the phone in shock.

And then I saw her—those bulging eyes—peeking through the door frame. But not on the 5'4" the landlord had just yesterday.

The… thing at the door was so large it had to bend its long, thin legs to fit through the doorway. Its limbs were grotesquely stretched, arms hanging unnaturally low, fingers twitching slightly, as if reaching for something. Its skin was sickly pale—almost translucent.

And her face had completely changed. Angular and sharp, with a jutting jaw and hollow cheeks. It felt like the skull of a starving animal. Eyes wide and fixed, and the way it held its head—tilted slightly, as if gauging the best way to strike—reminded me of a predator sizing up its prey.

I backed away slowly.

My hand brushed the half-head I still held, and I glanced at the jammed window, caught in the corner of my eye.

Without thinking, I grabbed the head and hurled it at the window with everything I had. The glass cracked loud and sharp.

The creature’s head snapped toward the sound. Then it moved—fast.

In desperation, I raised the head again, and slammed it into the window a second time. The glass shattered finally.

I launched myself through the opening with everything I had, glass cutting my arms. While in the air I could feel the creature’s long nails scraping against my calf, trying to grab me.

The apartment was on the third floor, and the fall felt so fast; all I remember is seeing the parked car I crashed onto.

And then it all went dark.

The following days were incredibly tough for me. And still are, because I’m writing this at the hospital, yet in recovery.

From the moment I woke up, machines beeping around the room, the pain hit me full force.

They told me I had broken both legs, part of my hip, and had multiple bruises all over the body. The car had saved my life.

Gina and her mom—my sister—stayed by my side most of the days, and it felt good to see them again after so long.

Even my father, whom I hadn’t spoken to in two years, spent a few nights with me. We reconnected in a way I hadn’t expected.

But what I really needed were answers—and the police didn’t give me many.

By the time they arrived at the apartment, there was no one there. The landlord was gone, somehow, and not a single trace of her was left behind.

No one saw her leave, and neither did the building’s security cameras. It was as if she had vanished into thin air.

The head I used to save myself belonged to the real owner of the property, Mr. Garcia, and a few neighbors mentioned that she had been a tenant in the studio I’d rented—not long before me.

Whatever investigation is being carried out, I am left in the dark, which only makes my anxiety worse.

Every night in the hospital is a torture. I lie awake for hours, staring at the door—or the air vent on the wall—waiting for it to come back and finish what it started.

And then there's this new nurse who’s been coming to check on me since the beginning of the week. She seems normal—young, and I dare say, kind of pretty. But there’s something off about her.

Her eyes… they’re wide and dark. Different. Bulging.
