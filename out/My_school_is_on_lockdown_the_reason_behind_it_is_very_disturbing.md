I 17 year old female, go to a high-school near a forest which the school forbids us to visit. My other friends and I have always wanted to see what secrets are behind those big tall trees. We have planned to sneak into the forest just before school on  Thursday, it is currently Wednesday so tomorrow will be a game changer. 

School was just about to end when our classroom doors locked, they were sealed shut. I stood up to see everyone in shock and the teacher was trying to calm down the crying girl. 

A few minutes later while trying to calm everyone down we heard screaming, screams of agony. I rushed to look out the window but before I could see anything my teacher stepped infront of me and told me its better if I don't see anything. I sat down, curious to what had caused that girl so much pain that she had to scream. 

The classroom became deadly silent, still lost in my thoughts about the screaming girl my eyes became heavy and I closed them for awhile. I was awoken by another scream followed by more and then a loud bang. I then pushed my way through the crowd of students to the window and what I saw next horrified not just me but everyone who stood and looked out the window. We were all petrified of what could happen to us... if we could be their next victim. 

I saw this thing, I have no idea what it's called. It has long black hair, it's covered in blood, there's blood dripping from its mouth and it's wearing a white dress that comes to its knees and had holes in it. You can see that it has been severely injured. As it sees its next victim running down the hall way, it screeches and runs on all fours, head faced backwards, it runs after the girl from class 8, I knew that girl she was in my gym class. I sadly had to watch her slowly get devoured by the creature. 

I tugged on my friends shirt and told her to see what is happening, all she said in return was "it can sense us, we next" 

I felt shivers throughout my body. I felt my legs get numb.  I heard a loud knock 3 times, before it was dead silence. Everyone was petrified for what could happen. The girl who was crying sudden stopped and turned to face the door. 

"I do not have a good feeling about this" she said too her boyfriend who's fear was visible on his face. 

The one window that was open suddenly closed. It was strange because no one was anywhere near that window. I could feel that something was off, I just had no idea what. I reached down for a chair, ready to throw it at anything that came into the classroom. 

After seconds of having all that fear and anxiousness build up inside us. It.. had... finally... entered.... As it walked the air was heavy and the room started to smell like like rotting corpse. It turned to look at the girl and her boyfriend. It's face pale white, I didn't dare to look it in it's eyes but they did. It screeched at ran at them, the way it ran made me wanna puke, it looked very disturbing. I watched in horror as the creature was slowly devouring them. 

I took my friends hand and ran out of the classroom and we both looked at each other when we reached the hallway, our eyes wide open to what we were witnessesing. 

Dead bodies laying all over the hallways. How could one creature eat so much? Unless there was more. 

My friend still standing there in shock let out a scream, which she should not have done. The creature bolted across the room, leaving the couple behind and took my friend in it's hand and munched on her. 

I slowly but softly went back into the classroom trying my best not to let out loud sobs as I watched the monster eat her, piece by piece. She screamed loudly and cried out for help but there was absolutely nothing I could do. With tears streaming down my face, I gradually closed the door. 

I walked to the corner of the room and sobbed, softly. 

The teacher called us all and told us something that was upsetting and very shocking. This information I am about to disclose has to be the most crucial part of what is happening. 

He told that this happens every 20 years, this creature lives in the forest and that is why we were forbid not to enter the forest. He also said it feeds on students of this school as revenge for building the school on its homeland.  The creature was a human that has been bitten by some other entity, we cannot fully explain the origin of this creature, there are some secrets that you would be better of without. We have still yet to find out what and where this entity is. 

I asked on how to escape from here but all the teacher have in response was, there's no escape, just be quite and don't look it in the eye and it won't attack you unless it's extremely hungry. 

I am currently writing this while sitting in the classroom still hearing it munching on other students not caring about there screams. I have no idea what how to cope with all these noises. I'm starting to loose hope, I'm wondering if we will ever get out... Everyone in the class is dead except me and one other kid who looks like his about to burst out crying... I can't get out of here, yet. I have to wait... I've been waiting for 3 days and 17 hours.. I have no hope left...  I still have mo explanation to anything but being here for 3 days is taking a toll on my health. I just want to leave...
