I’m not sure when she stopped loving me. Maybe when I was laid off from work. Or when I was hospitalised for my mental break. Or maybe when she started fucking her PT, Mathew. Who knows? All is know is that when she ended it, it broke me.

The thought of life without her was incomprehensible to me. Alicia and I had been together since we were 15 - High school sweethearts. When we were both 19, I proposed. I still remember how scared I was. God, I was a fumbling mess. But regardless, somehow she said yes, and we began our life together. That was 16 years ago. We were inseparable. Unstoppable. That was until June of this year… It replays in my mind over and over. 

In January, I was laid off from work. Something about cutting costs, you know, the usual shit they hit you with. Unfortunately that didn’t stop the bills rolling in. The mortgage still needed to be paid, food still had to be put on the table and her handmade jewellery business wasn’t even coming close to covering it. I had always said I would provide for her so she could pursue what she loved to do. Yet here I was, being turned down for every job I applied for, taking out loans anywhere that would allow me to, borrowing from anyone I could. But still, we were days from losing the house. The stress was too much - The guilt was too much. So much so, that in March I found myself walking down a busy highway. No clothes, no shoes, and no recollection of how I got there. 

A passerby had alerted the police, who promptly took me to the local hospital. I was tested for alcohol and drugs but was found to be completely sober. That’s when they came to the conclusion I had suffered a mental break due to stress and sent me to the closest mental health facility. After seeing movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Girl, Interrupted, I really didn’t have high hopes for this place, but much to my surprise, it was great. The doctors and nurses were incredibly helpful, the therapy sessions were wonderful and the other patients were people just like me, who had just lost their way. Alicia had come to visit me a few times but she seemed..off. Cold even. I put it down to me overthinking with my current state of mind.

After a few months, they had finally found medication that suited me, and coping techniques that helped me calm down. I was finally going home - Going home to Alicia. And I couldn’t wait. That is however, until I got home and realised her demeanour I felt at the hospital and put down to my overthinking, was in fact, very real. She looked at me differently. Stopped talking to me unless absolutely necessary. Started going to the gym more than she was home. Then finally in mid June, she hit me with the 5 words I dreaded the most.

“I can’t do this anymore”

My heart sank and my knees buckled. I couldn’t stop the flood of tears leaking from my eyes. 

“Please, I’ll do anything! Just give me another chance!” I pled. I must have looked so pathetic - But I was so overcome with emotion. She was my everything. My reason for living. I couldn’t remember life before her. But her expression never changed. She wouldn’t even look at me.

“I’m sorry. I’ve met someone else. I tried. I really did. But you’ve changed. You’re not the man I remember. You’re like a shell of him. I love you. I always will. But it’s not enough”

Truth be told, I saw this coming and yet still was somehow caught off guard by it. And with that, she turned and picked up two bags, already packed by the doorway - I hadn’t even noticed them. And that was it. I was alone. Alone for the first time in my life. No one to turn to. My parents were long gone by now and any friends I had drifted away from me when I was hospitalised or when I had text them constantly asking to borrow money. But I at least had my weekly therapy sessions.

“You know it’s not your fault Adam. You need to stop blaming yourself” Dr McAllister said in a reassuring tone, gazing at me over the top frame of her glasses, notebook and pen in hand. “Unfortunately things like this happen, but we have to find a way to go on. Have you been doing those written exercises I recommended?”

“Yeah..” I muttered while staring at the carpet. It was so filthy and cheap looking - When was the last time it was vacuumed? And god, that smell. What I assumed to be some fruity scented candle that was so overpowering it was sickening.

“Have you been taking your medication?”Dr McAllister said in a condescending tone. 

I could tell by the way she asked, she doubted me.

“Ofcourse I have” I snapped. “But pills can’t fix everything”

Dr McAllister sighed. “Listen Adam. Between you and I, I’ve been through more break ups than I’d like to admit - Even one divorce. Every single one feels like the end of the world. Trust me, I know. But somehow we find a way to carry on. It takes time and a lot of strength, but we manage eventually. I wish I could give you some amazing advice that would instantly take away your pain - but I’m just a therapist, I don’t have a magic wand. Unfortunately when it comes to something like this, it’s something you have to get through on your own. The tunnel will be long and dark, but there is light at the end, and you will make it”

“Wow, thanks Dr McAllister - I could have got that advice in any bullshit woman’s lifestyle magazine” I thought to myself as I sauntered out of her bleak, fruity smelling office. I left the office and let out a huge sigh. What a waste of time. I had no choice but to go home and resort to my new nightly routine - Two six packs and hours of video games. It was my way of shutting my brain off for a few hours. I walked into my eerily empty, silent house, kicked my shoes off and threw my keys in the bowl by the door. I threw my jacket on the couch and made my way to the kitchen. 

The dishes were piled high - honestly the house was a mess. Alicia would be disgusted. But I don’t care. There’s no one here to see the mess I live in - the mess I am.

I made my way to fridge and grabbed a can of Miller. I don’t particularly care for the taste, but it was cheap and I certainly wasn’t oozing money. I had a divorce to pay for. A house to try and save. I was living on ramen for gods sake. Safe to say I was flat broke. I continued into the living room and threw myself onto the couch with a thud, staring at the dimly lit ceiling. I had made a habit of turning on as little lights as possible. I had to save the electricity money and to be honest, I always found the dark quite comforting.

I wasted hours wandering around in Elden Ring til’ I couldn’t keep my eyes open any longer. Might as well try to sleep. I got up to turn off the tv as I had lost the remote to a moment of rage a couple of weeks back. I stumbled to the tv and shot a glance towards the mirror above the fireplace. I never understood the whole ‘mirror over the fireplace’ thing . A lot of people aren’t even tall enough to see themselves in it - Alicia was one of them. But she insisted on putting this huge vintage rectangular mirror with a gold baroque border above the fireplace. I always found it tacky, but according to her - I just had no taste.

I looked at my reflection and squinted. What happened to me? My face was covered in stubble, my eyes had huge black rings around them, my hair was longer than it should be and completely unkempt. I was disgusting. I stared at myself in awe. I became completely lost in my reflection when suddenly - I smiled. Well, I didn’t - my reflection did. At least I think it did? Nah, I must have imagined it. I probably should stop drinking on these meds.

I turned the tv off and slowly thudded my way up the stairs. I threw myself in my unmade mess of a bed and stared up at the ceiling - like I always did until I would fall asleep. But sleep never came. I couldn’t stop thinking. I couldn’t get that face out of my head - My face. But he looked so full of life. So alive. Not like me. Not like the shell I had apparently become.. I had to look again. I thudded back down the stairs and into the living room, feeling completely ridiculous as I did so - but I had to see. 

I found myself in-front of the mirror I hated so much, staring with anticipation. And after a few minutes, there he was, mirror-me, the man I wanted to be. I stared into his eyes and everything went numb. Minutes passed, hours passed- and next thing I knew, the sun had risen. It was morning. I had stood there all night, and was now looking back at that shell of a man, the me I hated - The real me. I felt absolutely insane. How could I stand there all night? Was I hallucinating? Had I officially lost it? 

The weirdest part was that I felt..comforted. Cathartic. The way you feel after you’ve told someone something you’ve never told anyone before - Like a huge weight was off my shoulders. The pain I had been feeling, the self loathing - it was all gone. It was like a high. That high was short lived however, because the tiredness of not sleeping all night finally hit me like a hard punch to the face. I made my way upstairs and fell asleep the minute I hit the pillow. When I woke, it was already evening. I stared at the time on my phone in shock. Since Alicia had left, I hadn’t managed more than a few hours, but today? Twelve. Twelve whole hours. Probably not considered healthy, but god, did I need it. 

I headed downstairs, into the kitchen and grabbed myself a drink of water. I stood against the worktop, sipping my water and flipping through Facebook. I really wish I hadn’t..

There she was. Alicia. And there he was - the home wrecking bastard, with his arm around her. They were smiling from ear to ear, with a beautiful sunset behind them. It was so generically cheesy - But I was overcome with rage and jealousy. She never looked that happy with me. Never. Had our relationship ment nothing to her? Was I that easy to forget? Did our vows even mean anything?  In sickness and in health? - Apparently not. For richer, for poorer? - Ha, yeah right. I gripped the glass so hard, I felt it crack beneath my fingers. 

I needed him.
I needed mirror-me.

I ran to the mirror and stared at him, hands bracing the shelf above the fireplace, rocking and forth. Rage coursing through me - Then, again after a few moments - he appeared. Same smile. Same reassuring eyes - And I was numb again. Pure bliss. 

This became my daily routine. Sleep, eat and spend time with mirror-me. He was my safe space. My sanctuary. My best friend. I didn’t need anyone else. I didn’t need to feel or think. He started appearing to me on all the mirrors I had in the house - so I was never alone. And every day that I saw him, his smile seemed even bigger. The only downfall was, everyday after my “mirror therapy”, when the sun rose, the wave of tiredness that hit me was worse than the day before . I wasn’t even making it to the bed anymore. I was just sleeping on the couch.

It was now early October. The dark nights were getting longer, which ment more time with mirror-me. It was great. Even if his smile had now gotten unsettlingly big. I stared into his eyes and lost myself - like I did every night, when suddenly I was shocked back to into reality by a cheerful jingle. I glanced around the room in a confused daze. What the hell was that? It took me a few seconds to come to the realisation, it was my phone! I can’t remember the last time it went. I almost forgot what it sounded like. I scrambled over to my phone and was instantly taken aback to see who was calling. A picture of Alicia and I filled the screen. What the fuck does she want?

I took a deep breath and answered. 

“Adam?” She enquired. I expected hearing her voice to send me into a spiral, but I felt nothing. Nada. Not a thing.
“Adam? Are you there?”

“What do you want Alicia?” I bluntly asked.

She sounded caught off guard. “There’s no need to be hostile - I know we left each other on bad terms, but I just wanted to check on you. I passed the house a few times this week and the house was in complete darkness. Are you o-“

“I’m fine” I snapped. “And how I am or what I’m doing is no longer your concern, nor is it your busin-“

“Adam” Alicia interjected. “we may not be together anymore - but I still care about you! I couldn’t live with myself knowing you were sitting suffering! I-“

I interrupted her with hysterical laughter. “You care about me? Did you care about me when you were disappearing to fuck him?- in-fact, you know what? I don’t care. I don’t care any more. I’m not wasting my breath on you. I don’t need you. I don’t need anyone. I hate you, and I genuinely hope the rest of your life is full of misery and suffering”

I was met with silence from the other end of the phone. I broke it by delivering one final blow. 

“Now if you’re done snooping to see if I’m still pining after you, I’d like to go and get back to enjoying my freedom. I don’t want to hear your shrill voice in my ears again. You make me sick”. And with that, I hung up.

I was shocked at myself - Yeah I was mad at her, sure. But I still loved her. Why did I talk to her like that? I would never talk to her like that. That was when I realised, I was smiling. So hard it hurt my cheeks I turned to mirror and noticed I was smiling just like him, and instead of the comfort it usually gave me - it filled me with unease. Something felt wrong. Very wrong. I slowly stood up and backed out of the room. I needed to get to a room without a mirror. I needed to be alone for a minute. I needed to be away from him. I ran to our spare room. I knew that was mirror free at least. I sat on the end of the bed. I don’t understand what’s going on. I don’t know what to do. I can’t exactly call the police and tell them I think there’s something wrong with the ‘me’ in the mirror. Nor can I call my therapist, cause the only help I’ll get is a straight jacket and a padded room. So I turned to the only place I could - The internet. There are all sorts of people on there, surely at least one is bound to believe me or know something.

And so I googled about mirror entities, demons - what ever I could think of and scoured the results from top to bottom. That’s when I saw a post on a forum amply titled “Don’t trust the other you in the mirror”. I stared in awe. I don’t like the sound of this.. I clicked and began to read. The post was by a user named “Spiritwalker67”.

It read:

“Ok, I know I’m going to sound insane, but I couldn’t live with myself if I knew I hadn’t at least tried to warn others.

I had been attending AA meetings regularly. I had hit rock bottom and was really struggling. I was at my lowest when a woman named Tina approached me and asked if we could be each other sponsors. I wasn’t super into the idea but I was willing to try.

She was lovely and really seemed to have it together. So much that I honestly wondered why she was even there. It was during our fourth phone call that she told me something I wish she hadn’t. She could tell I was sinking further and had a suggestion for me. 

“I know this is going to sound crazy, but please don’t dismiss it without trying at least once.” 

I was already rolling my eyes but I thought I’d hear her out. I was desperate. That’s when she told me about something she had named “mirror therapy”. She told me to dim the lights in my apartment and stare at myself in a mirror and meditate. Lose myself. She again stated she knew how crazy this sounded but assured me that the sense of inner peace I would feel would be worth it.

Fuck it, as I said, I was desperate. I figured I’d try. And much to my amazement, it worked, beyond belief. Not only that but I felt like my reflection was staring at me with kind reassurance. The look I had so wished my family and friends had given me. 

I became addicted to mirror therapy. I lived for it. However I noticed that when I wasn’t at the mirror I was overcome with lethargy. It was unbearable. If I left the house, I was like a zombie. It wasn’t until I went to AA a few weeks later and saw Tina, that I put two and two together.

Tina wandered in, but she wasn’t her usual odd, quirky self. No, she was.. empty. Dazed. I walked up to her to ask if she was ok and audibly gasped when she turned to face me with a face like a blank sheet of paper and eyes with no shine or life in them. She was like ..an empty vessel. And that’s when it started to come together. My lethargy, Tina’s zombie-like state. It was the mirrors. It had to be. I had no other explanation. I refused to believe Tina had relapsed or anything like that because she was doing so well and really had her mind set on getting her life together.

I didn’t know where to turn - the internet was providing nothing, so I went to the only other place I could think of for answers. The library.

I scoured the occult section from top to bottom for any mention of mirrors, it was the only place I could think to look and eventually I found something. And it filled me with anxiety. It spoke about spirits within the mirror and how when you were at your most vulnerable the veil between us and them was in a weakened state. It went on to explain that everytime you look into the mirror or “other realm”, the being at the other side takes pieces of your soul, until eventually there’s nothing left, and you are empty. The only way to save yourself is to close their doorway forever. In other words- break all your mirrors. It’s that simple. And so I headed home and did just that. Within weeks my energy came back, and I was back to my old struggling self, which I never thought I’d miss.

Again -  I know I sound insane, but in hopes I reach just one stranger out there, going through what Tina and I went through, please take my advice and don’t trust the other you in the mirror. Destroy it before it destroys you”

I sat there with my mouth agape. I was shocked, scared and for some reason, felt betrayed. Even though mirror me never spoke, I still felt like he had lied to me. He had given me a false sense of security, made me feel like I had a friend - I had no choice but to say goodbye to the friend I had counted on for months, who never judged me or made me feel crazy. But I couldn’t say goodbye without first confronting him. Stupid - I know, it’s not like he was going to answer me. But I had to get it off my chest and I at least needed this relationship to have some closure.

I wandered back down the stairs - slowly walking, eyes to the ground, towards the mirror. I couldn’t help but feel heartbreak. I slowly rose my eyes to the fireplace mirror I had grown to love and was greeted by my familiar comforting face. His smile was even bigger than last time. Now that I knew what I did about him, that smile made me incredibly uncomfortable.

I looked him in the eyes.

“I know what you are. I know what you’re doing. I’m sorry, but I can’t let you have me” My eyes fell to the ground. “Even knowing what you are, I still can’t help but want to thank you. You were the only one who was there for me at my lowest. I won’t forget you”

I looked up to meet his gaze one last time and felt the most intense fear I have ever felt surge through my body. That smile - that smile was gone. Now he was frowning. Not just frowning, it was indescribable. Full of anger. It was evil. His eyes were so wide they looked like they were about pop out of his head at any moment. But I couldn’t look away. That’s when he did something that made me feel fear like I had never felt before. His eyes got wider and his mouth began to open, wider and wider. Not horizontally like a smile, but vertically. Wider than was humanly possible. I took a step back trying not to take my eyes off him as I mindlessly reached around the room trying to grab anything heavy enough to shatter that god awful face. My aimless flailing was getting me nowhere, and I adverted my gaze for less than a second to grab the huge ugly candle holder on the coffee table that Alicia had got one Christmas from her mother. As I turned back to throw it, I was met with something I couldn’t believe I was seeing. Hands. So many hands. Seeping from every part of the mirror, reaching for me, grabbing for me. I closed my eyes tightly and threw a Hail Mary. I couldn’t open my eyes. I just prayed and waited for the obscene amount of hands to grab me and do whatever they were going to do to me. When suddenly, the sound of glass cracking. A beautiful choir of shattering. I opened my eyes to see that mirror I had grown so fond of had broken into a hundred pieces. I had never felt such relief. I exhaled hard. It was like i had been holding my breath for what felt like minutes without even realising. I ran upstairs and smashed all the other small mirrors that remained within the house without looking at them. It was done. It was over.

And with that. He was gone- Forever. My friend. My therapist. My mirror-me. 

My energy gradually returned to me over the weeks - and so did my pain and sadness. But I’d rather feel that than nothing at all. I still see him in my dreams though. Almost every night actually. Sometimes he has that comforting smile I had grown so attached to, but other times he has that god awful stretched, otherworldly mouth and frightfully wide eyes. I hate those dreams. But at least I’m alive - Soul-intact - and starting to get my life back on track little by little.

So, I’ll leave you with this - the same advice “Spiritwalker67” gave me, which saved my life.

No matter how good it makes you feel.
No matter how amazingly at peace you are.

Don’t trust the other you in the mirror.
