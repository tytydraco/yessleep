2 weeks ago my daughter, Karly wanted a big birthday party for her 6th birthday.
I figured that she's becoming a big girl, and every kid needs a party to remember, right?.

I reluctantly agreed to this considering me and her dad were getting a divorce. She screamed like the tight balloon gasping for air, but I had told her to be good or otherwise.

Now a day before her 6th birthday , I asked what toy she wants, she wanted some new toy, from a TV show (like those crappy ones with no quality), anyway she mostly wanted a girl called Daisy, she had ginger hair, and brown eyes with a cute little yellow head band. Karly adored this Daisy, she would act and dress up as her and  her emotions were the same, like hell she was devoted to her role, a little to well, as long as it took her mind off the nonsense she has been hearing I was happy.

In a rush"The store would open for this stuff, right? and it's a Sunday" before me and daisy had left, she exclaims she heard some "screams" within the night, this had been going on for a week but she said it was getting closer, I shook it off as leaving a soon to be 6 year old alone next to whipped cream was a bad idea. I said" daisy, you know your not aloud to eat too much suger." She replied in a moderate tone that I could only describe as sas from her when she said" Mum, I'm Karly not Daisy" after that she hopped into the car, I drove her to her dad's and nothing was said.

Dropping off Karly, her dad gave me a expression of mistrust, I had wondered why everyone was acting so weird, I had tried my best, eventually I rush to the store but it was already 6pm and they had closed, Karly would be so disappointed if I hadn't gotten her favourite character, so I'd thought I would make one for her.
Driving home I past the Richards house, they all had hazel eyes and blonde hair, it would of been a perfect match for a unique family but their daughter had gone missing a week ago, they looked tired and helpless. I could only hope the best for their hearts full of woe. I could only feel bad as many others had gone missing.

After I got home, I began to make this new toy, but I needed a base for my creation.
I had gotten up to the point that I was on the floor boards that might make to much sound even if you leaned on them, and looked in the kitchen drawers, I had found my set of keys, after all I need to do some washing for this doll. 
I emerged into the basement, it was so dark I had walked into something and felt it behind me, I hit hard, and it had made a crunch, must of been a dampened wall, putting the dolls washing on I went to my hair collection, and picked out the perfect strands, I'll always insist the best for her!.
A few more items and I'll be done, picking a yellow head band from the shelf, I noticed it had some brown stains, but it will do!. I brought everything upstairs and brought the key part of it all, picking up the base, I began to shape it, with my hatchet, only wispheres could be heard.

A few hours of work, cracking and sanding it was all done, I prepare for the gift and wrapped it up to be transferred in a big box when she comes home, going to sleep, I couldn't think less.

The day comes, and my ex comes with Karly, she hopped into my arms and I had told my ex to add some touches to the suprise, as our little one is quite sleepy, he looked at me with a warm look and told me he "would handle it." 
Sometimes I wished he was in my arms, but he didn't want to hurt me, I could only think that maybe I caught him off guard yesterday, preparing the little celebration for  her, he came up from the basement and told me he had made changes, after all he was a expert when making dolls, I told him I was almost done, but he stood behind me, watching me make the table, and wrap the last bow, he was getting to close for my ex...

Karly ran downstairs, and sat in her chair waiting for her gifts, my ex went down to the basement and took a while, but managed to lift up the box with a jump and bruise, she had leaped from her chair and opened it like a wild animal he stood there in glee, the doll was different from what I made, it was exactly like me, no details missed, in shock I was trying not to show discomfort, but he could see it, the next thing I know I feel a loud crunch, and I drop, probably like a "dampened wall".
I could only imagine if the richard's daugther would have the same fate as me, as she was only 21. and I was 27...
all I know is that im the next base...
