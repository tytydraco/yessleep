I need to get this out before it’s too late. I’ve been sitting on it for weeks, pacing my apartment, the hardwood creaking under my socks, the radiator hissing like a cornered cat. My hands shake as I type, the laptop’s glow stinging my bloodshot eyes. I haven’t slept in days—not since I went back to that place. If you’re reading this, don’t judge me too quick. Just listen. Maybe you’ll know what it means. Maybe you’ll tell me how to stop hearing the walls.

It started when my dad died last fall. October 17, 2024, to be exact—two days after my 29th birthday. Lung cancer took him fast, a chain-smoker’s grim finale. He was 63, wiry and gray, with hands like sandpaper from decades swinging hammers. He’d been a carpenter, the kind who could turn a pile of splintered oak into a dining table you’d swear was art. His last call came from hospice, voice raspy over the crackling line: “Jenna, the house is yours. Don’t sell it blind—check it first.” I didn’t think much of it then. He’d built that place himself, a squat two-story cabin on 12 acres north of Saranac Lake, New York, tucked in the Adirondacks where the pines choke out the sun. I figured he meant termites or a leaky roof. I was wrong.

I drove up three weeks later, November 8, a Friday. The air was sharp, smelling of wet leaves and frost, the kind that stings your nose and fogs your breath. My old Subaru crunched over the gravel drive, headlights slicing through the dusk to catch the house crouched against a wall of trees. It looked smaller than I remembered—sagging porch, cedar siding weathered to a dull gray, windows like dark eyes smudged with grime. The chimney puffed lazy smoke; I’d paid a neighbor, old Mr. Gentry, to light the woodstove before I got there. Inside, the place was a time capsule: plaid couch with cigarette burns, a rotary phone on the wall, Dad’s toolbox by the hearth—rusted pliers, a claw hammer, nails scattered like teeth. The air hung heavy with dust and the faint tang of mildew, the floorboards groaning under my boots.

I dropped my duffel by the stairs—narrow, steep, carpeted in faded maroon—and started a fire. The logs snapped, spitting embers that danced up the flue, casting jittery shadows on the pine-paneled walls. I’d brought a thermos of coffee, black and bitter, and poured it into one of Dad’s chipped mugs, the one with “World’s Okayest Carpenter” in peeling letters. That’s when I noticed the hum. Low, steady, like a fridge compressor but deeper, vibrating in my chest. I checked the kitchen—empty fridge, unplugged—then the basement door, a slab of unpainted oak by the pantry. The hum pulsed louder there, seeping through the wood. I jiggled the knob; locked. Dad never locked it when I was a kid. I shrugged it off, too tired to hunt for a key, and crashed on the couch, the fire’s crackle lulling me under.

I woke to scratching. Not loud—soft, deliberate, like fingernails on drywall. My eyes snapped open, the room dim, fire down to glowing coals. The digital clock on the mantle blinked 3:14 a.m., its red digits fuzzy in the dark. The scratching came from upstairs, a slow drag, then a pause, then again—scritch, scritch, stop. I sat up, blanket slipping to the floor, my breath shallow and quick. The house was old, sure—mice, wind, settling beams—but this felt wrong, too rhythmic. I grabbed the fireplace poker, cold iron biting my palm, and crept to the stairs. The maroon carpet muffled my steps, but each creak of the wood underneath spiked my pulse. The air grew colder as I climbed, a draft licking my bare arms, smelling faintly of damp earth and something sour, like spoiled milk.

At the top, a hallway stretched left and right, five doors total: three bedrooms, a bathroom, and a closet. The scratching came from Dad’s room, second on the right. The door was ajar, hinges squeaking as I nudged it open with the poker’s tip. Moonlight spilled through the single window, its frame warped, glass streaked with years of rain. The room was sparse—twin bed with a sagging mattress, a dresser topped with a cracked mirror, a rug frayed to threads. The scratching stopped the second I crossed the threshold, silence so thick it pressed on my ears. Then I saw it: the wall by the bed. A patch of plaster, maybe two feet wide, was scored with thin, jagged lines—dozens of them, crisscrossing like a kid’s chaotic sketch. They weren’t there last time I’d visited, two years back. I touched one, tracing the groove; it was deep, fresh, plaster dust crumbling under my fingertip.

A thud jolted me—heavy, deliberate, from below. I spun, poker raised, heart hammering against my ribs. The hum was back, louder, rolling up through the floorboards like a growl. I bolted downstairs, boots slipping on the last step, and froze. The basement door stood wide open, a black rectangle exhaling cold, musty air. The lock dangled, broken, its screws glinting on the floor. I hadn’t touched it. I edged closer, poker trembling in my grip, and peered down. A wooden staircase descended into shadow, each step warped and splintered, the hum now a steady drone that buzzed in my skull.

I should’ve left. Every nerve screamed to grab my keys and run, but Dad’s voice echoed—“Check it first.” I flicked the light switch by the door; nothing. My phone’s flashlight cut a thin beam, catching cobwebs and dust motes as I took the first step. The wood sagged under my weight, creaking like a warning. The air thickened as I went—damp, metallic, with that sour edge stronger now, sticking in my throat. At the bottom, the basement sprawled, a concrete box lit only by my shaking light. Shelves lined one wall, stuffed with mason jars—cloudy, unlabeled, their contents sloshing as I passed. A workbench sat opposite, strewn with tools: a handsaw, chisels, a mallet crusted with something dark. The hum pulsed from the far corner, where a tarp draped over a lumpy shape, stained and frayed at the edges.

I yanked the tarp back. Underneath was a wooden hatch, crude and uneven, nailed into the concrete with thick, rusted spikes. The hum poured from it, vibrating the floor, and with it came a sound—low, wet, like someone sucking air through a clogged straw. My stomach twisted. I pried at the hatch with the poker, nails screeching as they gave. The wood lifted, revealing a hole—rough, hand-dug, maybe three feet wide, dropping into blackness. The smell hit me hard—rot, copper, and that sour milk stench, so thick I gagged. My light caught something down there: a glint, then movement—a slow, jerking shift, like a limb flexing.

I stumbled back, dropping the poker with a clang. The hum spiked, a deafening roar, and the walls—God, the walls—started to breathe. The pine panels flexed, bulging out then sucking in, splintering at the seams. Dust rained from the ceiling, and that wet sound grew—gurgling, gasping, closer. I scrambled upstairs, slamming the basement door, and jammed the couch against it. The whole house shook, windows rattling, the floor bucking like a living thing. I grabbed my duffel, keys jangling, and ran for the car. The Subaru roared to life, tires spinning gravel as I floored it, the cabin shrinking in the rearview. But I heard it—one last time, clear as a bell through the chaos: “Jenna.” My name, rasped from the dark.

I’ve been back in Albany since, 200 miles south, but it’s not far enough. The hum followed me. It’s faint at first—nights only, seeping from my apartment walls. I’ve checked the studs, the pipes, even tore out drywall—nothing. My neighbor, Mrs. Platt, bangs on the ceiling when it gets loud, her broom thumping like a judge’s gavel. Last week, I woke to scratches on my bedroom wall—thin, jagged, just like Dad’s room. The mirror fogged up yesterday, no steam, no heat, and something pressed against it: a handprint, too big, fingers splayed and webbed. I smashed it, glass slicing my knuckles, blood dripping on the carpet.

Last night was worse. The hum turned to words—mine, warped and slow, like a tape played backward. “Jenna… come… back…” I recorded it, phone trembling, and played it for my friend Mark. He heard static, nothing else. I hear it clear as day. The walls here flex now, just a twitch, but it’s growing. My landlord’s coming tomorrow—eviction notice pinned to my door, yellow paper curling at the edges. I don’t care. I’m going back to the cabin tonight. Not to stay—to burn it. Gasoline’s in my trunk, matches in my pocket. Dad built that house, but something’s in it, something he locked away—or fed. If I don’t stop it, it’ll keep coming.

If you’ve seen this—heard it—tell me. What did he build down there? What’s calling me? I’ll check this post before I go, signal permitting. If I don’t reply… don’t come looking.
