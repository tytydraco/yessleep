The wards of the mental asylum were my home for years. The first time I entered it, I felt like I had entered a labyrinthine nightmare. The walls were grey and gloomy, and the windows were barred and sealed. The air was dense, with the overpowering smell of disinfectants and the faint echoes of screams and cries.

As I wandered through the endless maze of hallways, the whispers and the shadows that lingered in every corner sent shivers down my spine. I could feel the weight of fear pressing against my chest as I tried to make sense of the asylum's layout.

The staff and inmates were the only company I had in this place. The staff were the only reassurance for years before the inevitable descent into madness. But even their presence could do little to keep the voices that haunted the halls at bay.

One night, I heard something different: the sound of someone humming in the distance. A melody I couldn't recognize but felt familiar. Slowly, I approached the source of the sound, and it led me into a long hallway and stopped at one of the cells.

As I peered through the small window in the door, I saw a small figure moving frantically inside. It was thin and frail, with long greasy hair cascading down its emaciated back. In a sudden surge of curiosity and concern, I stepped closer to the door.

"Who are you?" I whispered, hoping the figure could hear me.

"Help me, please," the figure replied, its voice barely audible.

"What can I do?" I asked.

"Free me from here," the figure implored.

I hesitated for a moment before trying the cell's door, but it was locked shut from the outside with no keyhole or knob to open it. As I stepped back, I noticed that the humming had stopped, and the figure was now staring at me with piercing eyes.

"What's happening to me?" I muttered, feeling a strange sensation in my head.

"That's what I want to know," the figure replied, its voice now more menacing than before.

In a sudden surge of panic, I turned to leave, but the figure's voice stopped me.

"You can't leave me here," it said, "You belong here like the rest of us."

The words echoed in my mind as I stumbled through the dark hallways, wondering if I was losing my mind. In the following days, I found myself still in the same hallway, the figure now at my side.

"You're me," the figure said, "The asylum has claimed your soul, just like it did with mine."

I tried to resist, but it was no use. I had become one with the asylum, and the entity inside me continued to grow stronger with every passing day.

As I watched the staff and the buildings slowly deteriorating into ruins, I realized that the entity had drained it of all life. My own being had become fused with that of the asylum's, and I was no longer a human but a twisted adaptation of the asylum.

The once-ominous hallways that used to terrify me now felt like home, and I could hear the voices and see the shadows of all the souls that the asylum had claimed. I was one of them now, consumed by the same darkness that had lurked in every corner of the asylum.

Today, the asylum stands abandoned, a forgotten relic of the past. But the entity within me remains, and I am still trapped within its walls, spending eternity as the asylum's shadowy inhabitant , my destiny was sealed.

After years of the incident I found that in this state i cannot come back to my original body, but my original body has been buried years ago. And then i remembered the figure that i saw in the hallway. It had the ability to transfer its consciousness and the suffering to me. I figured out even i could do it. Ever since then I waited for someone to approach the old ruins.

A few days back at midnight a group of 5 teenagers had come to explore the famous horrors of this place. I had to get out of here so i transferred the same pain and endless suffering to a boy named Tom. He has become a part of the asylum now.  

I have escaped the curse but I feel guilty enough for trapping a young person there. but i had to come out to warn the others. 

This is a warning for all ! 

'Do not visit the ruin at any cost'
