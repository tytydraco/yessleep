When I walked through the church doors I didn’t even realize I was holding my breath. It had been so long since I last stepped foot in a holy place, I half expected to burst into flames the moment I crossed the threshold. But no inferno overtook me, no voices echoed out announcing the arrival of wickedness incarnate. I slunk down the aisle, narrow pews on each side of me standing inert like the desiccated ribs of some fossilized giant.


My purpose here was salvation. I had hit my lowest low and desperation had driven me to repentance. If all else had forsaken me, I could only hope that I still held favor in God’s eyes. I awkwardly stepped closer to the altar, adamantly avoiding the gaze of Jesus pinned to the cross. His towering visage brought shame bubbling to the surface of my subconscious. We both knew I had no right to beg forgiveness, and yet still I was here to grovel before Him. I sat a few rows from the front and bowed my head.


“What do I do now?” I whispered, awkwardly adjusting to the unfamiliar environment. Years of rejecting the ideology I was raised upon had left my memory of the church cobwebbed.


“I should leave, this isn’t going to fix my choices. I can’t turn back and stop myself. All those people I hurt. My family, my wife. All the innocents who trusted me. All the lives snuffed out because of my greed.” Tears stung my eyes, my self-loathing paramount, it was time to confess. No priest or counselor to hear me, this was between myself and the spirits within these walls.


“Father. Please help me. I have sinned. Darkness has taken root in my soul and I welcomed it because it felt so warm and rich. I let it pour into my heart and because of that, dozens of good people are dead. Pure souls. Elders, parents, children…” A sob rasped in my throat. Yet I could not stop the words from spilling out, a hopeless admittance far, far too late.


“My one job was to make sure their homes were safe, that they could live their lives and raise their families without fear. But my greed made me falter, and I turned a blind eye. I knew the wiring was all wrong, and I knew the fire escapes were completely rusted through, but the cheap labor and bullshit inspections meant more money in my pocket. And when the whole block burned down and my tenants couldn’t escape in time, I tried to cover my ass with more lies. I threw my employees under the bus. And everyone found out anyway. My reputation, my business, all my money is gone. My wife and kids, they left me. Any day now the charges will come through and I’ll be held accountable for all those lost lives. I can’t beg forgiveness from the dead, so I’m here to ask you. I have been a bad man and I accept my wrongdoings, but I have no malice in me. I know I can be better. I will be better. Your mercy is all I am asking for. Please.”


My entire being was burning with shame. If this was what the fires of Hell felt like, I feared eternity. I accepted my cowardice. The biting hollowness inside me was all that remained of the man I once was. With my heart laid bare, I waited for a response. I imagined a ray of pure incandescence and a booming voice telling me all was forgiven as I was just a child, stumbling about in a dark world of sin. 
I waited and waited, and… nothing happened. No light shot down from the heavens, no weight was lifted from my shoulders, no answer was given. Just dust trickling from the rafters and the creaking of old wood. My anger blossomed. This was supposed to help me. This was supposed to save me. I knew I deserved no vindication, but I still had expected something. Some epiphany for how to get myself out of this mess or a clearing of my conscience at the very least.


I was about to stand, fully prepared to storm out in a fit of rage and turn my back on this farcical house of worship. But a sound broke the stillness, the groaning creak of the front doors. Something stopped me from looking back, and my eyes fixed upon the crucifixion statue. The eyes of the Savior were striking in the dark. His face warped with sorrow, pupils fixed on mine with unabashed melancholy. And behind me, footsteps. Not the shuffling gait of another shy, late-night churchgoer, but small sharp steps. Like hooves. I forced my gaze away from the statue and turned my head. A silhouette was illuminated by the shy sliver of moonlight snaking through the cracked door. Blinking away tears, I struggled to focus on what I was seeing. A sheep. A large sheep traipsing towards me. The click-clacking of its hooves disturbed the solemn environment. As it drew closer I finally saw its face. Fear replaced guilt in the forefront of my mind and cold beads of sweat broke across my brow.


It was a terrible beast, smiling at me with a wide open jaw and rows upon rows of square white teeth. Its mouth a rictus grin that appeared to dislocate its hollowed cheekbones. The thing’s eyes were round and full of joy. Its horizontal pupils were fixed on me and I realized I could not move, I could barely breathe. This animal had no place here and its inexplicable presence felt like that of a reaper come to claim my ghost. As it slowly stepped up to the end of my pew I could barely muster the strength to ask,  
 “What are you going to do to me?”


The sheep smiled wide. The many teeth set in its long mouth clicked together, sounding like a chorus of beetles scuttling over each other.
“I will forgive you, child. I will eat your sins away and leave you pure. Will you give them to me?” The voice of the thing was smooth and gentle.


“What do you mean? Are you… are you God?” I whispered, captivated.


It let out a bleating laugh, a vocalization between that of animal and man.  
“No child. God will not listen to your prayers. He did not listen to mine either. But I heard you crying out and I wish to help you. I can cleanse you, in body and in spirit. All I need is your permission.”


I still did not understand the being before me. But the softness in its tone and my blind desperation urged me to accept the comforts of anyone, of anything.


“O-okay. Please. How? What do you want? I’ll give anything, I- I just want all of these terrible things I’ve done to go away. I want my family back, and I want to be a free man. I just- I’m so sorry for what I’ve done.” Tears formed in my eyes again at the possibility that my repentance would go unrewarded.


Somehow the sheep’s smile stretched even wider, pressing against the edges of its face.  
“I will consume your sin. I will swallow it whole and the darkness within you will belong to me. I can break the chains from your ankles and you will be as light and free as a bird. It will not hurt, child. Tell me this is what you want.” 


Something about its tone almost made me hesitate. It sounded excited. It sounded hungry.  
“Okay- okay yes. Free me, please. I’m ready.” I gasped.


Without pause it closed the distance between us and, in one gentle yet firm motion it pushed me to the ground. Paralyzed by terror, the wind knocked clean out of me as I stumbled backwards. The sheep’s full weight pinned me to the cold stone floor. Its face close to mine, I could smell wet wool and incense-spiced smoke; rotten fruit putrid and foul. Gleefully, it lowered its head and began to eat. Blunt teeth pressed into the soft skin of my abdomen. I could feel its breath, hot and feverish. It ripped me open with ease, dark wet viscera dripping off its chin. I felt no pain. The shock had already shut down my brain’s nociception.


As my vision blurred, I saw the sheep with its jaw buried in my shredded stomach cavity. The white wool on its head flecked with dirty meat and the chunky contents of my intestines. Stained like wine on clean linen. It ate of my flesh with zealous fervor, and as my bones cracked under its hooves and blood flowed freely into my lungs, it wept.
