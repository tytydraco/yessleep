The air in the Smokies
always felt…thicker.
Not just the humidity, but something heavy, ancient,
a weight that settled deep in your bones.
My mamaw, bless her golden heart, swore it was the mountain breathing.
She’d always say,
"Boy, this here land, it ain't just dirt and trees. It’s got a memory, and sometimes,
it likes to remind you."
She had her "Rules," passed down through generations of folks who lived in these hollers, words whispered more than spoken, like secrets the wind carried through the pines. My cousin, Colter, scoffed at them. Said they were just old wives' tales.
He learned different.


Rule number 1.
"If you hike where the fog clings low to the pine,
And the wind through the holler hums mournful in time,
Then heed what the old ones have carved into lore,
Or you won’t leave the woods like you’ve left them before."


Grace, my best friend, was always the first to point out when the light started to fade, her voice tight with a nervousness she tried to hide. It was the first rule everyone learned, the one ingrained in the very soul of mountain folk.


Rule number two.
"When daylight is dying,
be back in your bed,
For the dusk wakes the
ones that remember the dead."


Colter, of course, stayed out. He was always pushing boundaries, seeing how far he could go before the mountain pushed back. He came back that night, pale and shaking, muttering about something scratching at his window, which I should point out,
is on the second floor of his parents two story house something that sounded like
an old woman crying his name.
He wouldn’t elaborate, just kept repeating,
"It didn't move right."


Rule number three.
"Don’t open for knocking,
don’t answer your name,
If it stands on two legs but don’t move the same."


A few weeks later, old Silas Boone vanished. He’d always been a solitary man, kept
to himself in a cabin deep in the woods. Sheriff Miller said it looked like he just walked off, but his grandniece, Elara, found his dog, whimpering by the door, and on the porch,
a single withered black-eyed Susan, a flower that didn’t grow wild anywhere near his cabin. Elara said she’d heard a faint, sweet melody drifting from the woods the day
before Silas disappeared.


Rule number four.
"If you hear a soft song
where no singer should be,
Keep walking and humming, eyes down, don’t you dare see."


My neighbor, Martha Mae Hubbard, a sweet woman who baked the best apple pie, swore by the bread offering. She’d always leave a slice on the old oak stump by the trail leading to the creek.
"A thank you to the Little Ones," she'd explain,
"for letting me pass."
One time, her grandson, Tommy, a stubborn little sprout, kicked it over. That night, their well went dry. Their entire crop of corn withered, and a strange, persistent itch covered Tommy's skin, a rash that no doctor could diagnose.


Rule number five.
"Leave bread on the stump
if you’ve borrowed the trail,
Or the Little Ones curse you with more than just ail."


It was Old Man Hemlock who warned me about the figure in the field. He’d seen it once,
a tall, gaunt shape standing motionless at the edge of his property, just watching. He made the mistake of waving, a friendly gesture. For weeks after, he swore he felt eyes on him, even inside his own home. He started boarding up his windows, even in the daytime. The last time I saw him, he was rambling about
"it knows, it knows," his eyes wide with a terror that
made my stomach churn.


Rule number six.
"Don’t wave at the figure
who waits in the field,
It knows you’ve now seen it
and won’t stay concealed."


My mamaw always drilled
this one into me:
"Never give it a name, son. Never speak of what you see if it ain't got a place in God's good world."
We were hiking once, me and Caleb, my younger brother, when he pointed to something in the thick undergrowth, a movement that was too quick, too fluid to be any animal we knew. He started to say something, a question forming on his lips. I clapped my hand over his mouth, hard, and pulled him away.
We ran, not looking back. Later, he told me he’d felt something cold brush his leg, like skeletal fingers.


Rule number seven.
"Don’t speak of the thing that you glimpsed in the trees,
What’s named becomes real, and it’ll find you with ease."


The silence is the worst.
Not the normal quiet of the woods, but a sudden, absolute cessation of sound. No birds, no rustling leaves, not even the distant hum of traffic from the highway.
That’s when you hold your breath, when your heart pounds in your ears, because you know something has entered the woods with you. My uncle, Beau, a hunter who prided himself on his fearlessness,
said he experienced it once.
He dropped his rifle, frozen, and felt a cold breath on the back of his neck, though nothing was there.
He never hunted no where near that part of the woods again.


Rule number eight.
"If silence falls sudden,
then hush every breath,
For the quiet in woods
is the herald of death."


Three pennies at the crossroads. My papaw, Elias, always kept a handful in his pocket, just in case.
He never explained why, just said it was "for the fare."
Old Mabel Jenkins, who lived down by the creek, scoffed at it. Said it was superstition.
She had a shortcut through the woods, a little-used deer trail that crossed an old, forgotten crossroads.
One day, she just…
didn't come back from town.
Her daughter, Rose, found her shawl by the crossroads, tangled in briars, and nothing else.


Rule number nine.
"Three pennies at crossroads,
don’t ask, just obey,
Or you’ll owe a fare that you
can’t ever pay."


The old oak by the abandoned church has a face in its bark,
a twisted, agonized grimace that seems to change with the light. Some local teenagers, trying to prove how brave they were, decided to carve their
initials into it.
The next morning, they were found disoriented, miles from the church, their hands covered in deep, festering splinters that no doctor could explain, and their minds clouded with nightmares that clung to them for years.


Rule number ten.
"Don’t cut at the oak
with a face in the bark,
Its roots run through bones buried deep in the dark."


My mamaw always taught us about hospitality. If a stranger joined your fire, even in the middle of nowhere, you offered them food. But she warned,
if their eyes didn't meet yours,
if they stared into the flames as if searching for something lost, you offered food,
spoke no questions, and when they left, you offered praise,
no matter how odd their departure. My cousin, Jessie,
a skeptic like Colter, once encountered such a man.
He questioned him, tried to make conversation.
The man stood up, silent, and walked directly into the deepest part of the night, leaving no tracks. Jessie was found the next morning, muttering incoherently, and never spoke a clear word again. Poor fella refuses to ever be alone.
Scared pale that if he ever is that man'll come back as if he's out there just beyond the tree line watching and waiting.


Rule number eleven.
"If a man joins your fire
and don’t meet your gaze,
Offer food,
speak no questions,
and part ways with praise."


Fishermen around here know the moon's height. My uncle, David, a seasoned angler, always packed up his gear when the moon was at its peak. He’d seen things,
he said. Shadows under the water, movements that weren’t fish. One young tourist, Brenda, scoffed, wanting to catch
"just one more."
Her line went taut, her reel screaming, and she was dragged into the murky depths of the lake so fast that her friend, Mark, barely had time to scream before she was gone, leaving only her fishing rod floating on the surface.

Rule number twelve.
"Don’t fish past the hour
when the moon’s at its height,
What bites past that mark drags you down out of sight."


Come the coldest nights, when the wind howls like a hungry wolf, my mamaw would always mark ash on the doorframe. Not just any ash, but ash from the hearth, blessed by the
warmth of our home.
Mrs. Gable, the new arrival from the city, laughed when I suggested it.
That winter, her house was plagued by strange, icy drafts, and she swore she heard whispers echoing through her empty rooms, mocking her.
She left come spring,
her face pale and drawn.


Rule number thirteen.
"Mark ash on your door
come the coldest of nights,
To ward off the shadows that dance without light."


The most unsettling rule, though, was the last one. It was something that happened to Aunt Polly, a quiet woman who lived alone.
She woke up one morning with dirt on her bare feet, though she swore she hadn't left her bed. She followed the rule, lay back down, and said her thanks. But for days after, she had a faint scent of pine and damp earth clinging to her,
and sometimes, in the dead of night, we could hear her humming a tune that no one in our family had ever heard before, a haunting, low melody that seemed to pull at something deep inside you.


Rule number fourteen.
"If you wake up with dirt
on the soles of your feet,
Say thanks and lie down,
don’t recall, don’t repeat.
For the journey you took
was not of your will,
And the whisper you followed keeps beckoning still.
And pray, not the way
that the preacher man said,
But with the tongue of
your mamaw,
hushed, mournful, and low,
For only the ancient words sever the ties,
That bind you to shadows beneath mountain skies."


So, when you hear the wind whisper through the pines,
or witness the fog settle low and heavy, remember the rules.
The mountain remembers,
and it collects its dues.
