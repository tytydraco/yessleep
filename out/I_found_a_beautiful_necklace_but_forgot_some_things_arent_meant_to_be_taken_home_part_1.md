I was around 15-16 my parents had just started letting me out with my friends as long as they knew where I was, which I totally understand, and this one time a carnival was in town and it was summer break me and my two best friends Aya and nancy decided to go.

So the second day that the carnival was up we went their at about 6 in the evening. 

Everything was great, the food, the games, prizes all of it after eating a lot of food and playing a lot of games we came across a game stand it had weird *different* prizes, from what I remember, it had a brown teddy bear, plastic dolls, a ring, bracelet and a necklace. I don't remember the type of game it was but I do remember spending a lot of time trying to win it and after I finally did I asked for the necklace which was laying on the table with the other prizes it was on the very edge but I had assumed it was a prize but it wasn't. The lady running the stand looked at the necklace, a look of surprise crossed her face before she said "sorry deary but this isn't a prize I don't know how it ended up here" her voice was ragged, almost as if she was having trouble speaking but nonetheless she looked back at me with an apologetic smile "why don't you take the ring or the bracelet instead?" I was a little downcast since the necklace was so pretty but I didn't wanna annoy the old lady and just smiled and took the ring.

It was around 9 by the time we were finished exploring the carnival my dad was supposed to come pick us up and as we were making the way towards the exit I saw the old lady from the game stand throwing the necklace onto the ground and stomping on it before speed walking with all her things to, I am assuming, her car. I didn't know why she threw it away , bad memories maybe? I had thought to myself like a naive fool and being the way I was I picked up the necklace and shoved it into my pocket on our way out my friends tried to protest but in the end the necklace was too pretty *too* pretty.

After dropping off my friends and going back to my house I put the necklace and ring in the drawer where I kept all my other accessories and after doing this and that fell asleep at about 12:30 but at 3 I was kind of woken up to the sound of a man calling my voice, I say kind of because I was still half asleep, the voice was followed by banging but I didn't react maybe because my brain wasn't processing what was happening. After a few minutes the voice went away replaced by my mother calling for me, calling my name like my mom did when she would want me to do something for her so I replied in a grumble involuntarily but after a few more times of her calling for me I was finally awake but the voice could no longer be heard now it was replaced by silence that was only broken after I called out to her "mom?" "Mom?!" "Mom?!?" In increasingly agitated and annoyed voice. Sometimes she wouldn't reply untill I was shouting at the top of my lungs even if she was in the next room untill finally my dad woke up and came to my room. "What's wrong?" He had asked in a lazy sleepy voice but tinted with concern.

After I told him the whole thing he sent me to sleep in  my parent's room while he slept in mine, I was relieved that I wouldn't have to sleep alone but what I didn't know was that this was only the beginning of a very long and dark time.
