I don’t know where to start, but I need to get this off my chest. I’m shaking as I type this. My best friend, Ryan, vanished three years ago. No trace, no goodbye, nothing. And last week, he showed up at my door with a note that’s tearing my reality apart. Please, I need your help to make sense of this.

Ryan and I were inseparable since we were kids. We grew up in a small town, shared every secret, every dumb dream. Three years ago, he didn’t show up to our weekly game night. His phone was off, his apartment empty. Police found nothing—no credit card activity, no social media, no body. It was like he was erased. I grieved, I mourned, I blamed myself. I thought he was gone forever.

Last Thursday, at 2 a.m., someone knocked on my door. I live alone, so I grabbed a bat and checked the peephole. It was Ryan. Same messy hair, same goofy grin, but… something was off. His eyes were too bright, like they were reflecting light that wasn’t there. He hugged me, and I swear his skin felt wrong—too smooth, too cold, like polished glass.

He didn’t explain where he’d been. He just handed me a folded piece of paper and said, “Read this when you’re ready. It’s everything.” Then he left. No car, no sound of footsteps, just… gone again. I locked the door, sat on the floor, and read the note. I’ve read it a hundred times since, and I’m still not okay.

The note wasn’t in Ryan’s handwriting. It was in mine. Perfectly, like I’d written it myself. But I didn’t. It said:

“You’re not alone. You never were. We’ve been watching, waiting for you to see. Ryan is safe, but he’s not yours anymore. He’s ours. Follow the light in the woods at 3:33 a.m. tomorrow. You’ll understand. You’ll be free. Don’t tell anyone, or it stops.”

The note ended with a drawing of a symbol I’d never seen before—a circle with three spirals inside, like a galaxy. But here’s the part that’s breaking me: I dreamed of that symbol the night before Ryan came back. I hadn’t told anyone about it. How could it be on the note?

I didn’t go to the woods. I was too scared. But every night since, I hear whispers outside my window—soft, happy voices, like they’re excited for me. Last night, I saw a light in the backyard, pulsing, warm, almost… inviting. I wanted to go to it. I still do. It feels like home, but it also feels wrong, like I’d lose myself if I got too close.

Here’s the happy part, I guess: Ryan is alive. He’s out there, somewhere, and he seemed… okay. Peaceful, even. But I’m horrified because I don’t think he’s human anymore. And I’m starting to wonder if I am.

I’m breaking the note’s rule by posting this. I don’t know what’s going to happen. But I can’t keep this inside. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Seen that symbol? Heard those whispers? I need to know I’m not crazy. I need to know what’s waiting in the woods.
