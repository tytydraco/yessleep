The mind is a strange thing.  
  
For some, it is as flexible as the willow tree. Able to bend with the storm, but never break.  
  
For others, it is as strong as steel, unyielding. Able to bear all the world can throw at them.  
  
For the unfortunate few, the mind is a fragile glass. Seemingly sturdy — until you apply pressure.  
  
Then, cracks.  
  
Then, it begins to break.  
  
Until with a crash, it shatters.  
  
A thousand glittering remnants, a human mind scattered.  
  
A piece here, a piece there. A thought, broken in two. All the powers of reason laid low, smashed beyond repair.  
  
A piece here, a piece there connect — *almost.*  
  
They form strange shapes, twisted. Incomplete, with leaps and jagged edges.  
  
Almost reasonable, almost sane — but not *quite.*  
  
To lose your mind is the greatest of horrors. To be unable to distinguish between reality and fiction. To never truly know if what you see is real or a lie. Thank whatever deity you believe in, on your hands and knees, that you never suffered such a fate. Thank them that you have retained the ability to perceive the world as it truly is. Thank them that your ability to reason remains. That you are still you.  
  
Then again.  
  
If you did lose your mind—  
  
Would you ever know?

*"You killed me, you* bastard*."* Moe's face, so reserved in life, was twisted in death. An unearthly rage filled the face of the man I had called friend in a world where such things were rare. His features ruined by burns and skin that looked like molten metal, disfigured by the explosion that had taken his life and confined me to bed rest for the last few weeks.  
  
I shook my head in an attempt to dispel the figure before me, my eyes shut tight . "No, no. " I licked my lips nervously. "It..it wasn't my fault, it wasn't my fault." I swallowed. "No."  
  
*"Yes."* The words hissed from Moe. *"I died. I died because of you."* His voice rattled from ruined vocal chords, a rasp that set my hair on edge. I opened my eyes slowly.  
  
"No."  
  
*"Your fault."*  
  
"NO!" I screamed at him. He roared back, and as he did, flames burst into life around me. They trapped me in a circle of fire that began to close and get tighter and tighter. I could feel the heat from the flames increasing. "NO!" I howled. Moe's face took on a demonic cast as the flames danced in front of him.  
  
*"Suffer."*  
  
The light flickered.  
  
*"Suffer as I suffered."*  
  
It was a vision of some hell, a righteous wrath I had brought upon myself.  
  
*"Burn as I burned."*  
  
Closer came the flames, and the uncomfortable feeling grew into pain. The flames reached me, catching on my clothes, my skin. The pain was intolerable and I began to weep.  
  
*"DIE...*  
  
"No." The word slipped from my lips, soft with defeat and regret and guilt as the fires consumed me.  
  
*"...AS I DIED."*  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
I awoke on fire.  
  
Not truly, but it felt so. That happened, sometimes. I would be fine, and then...fire. My body and mind seemed eager to remind me of the trauma it had suffered from the explosion.  
  
But it was just a memory, a lie, a trick my mind played on me. So there was nothing for me to do but wait. And suffer.  
  
And scream.  
  
It went away after a little, and I lay in bed for a while. Doing nothing. Finally, I got up, dressed myself slowly, being mindful of my bandages, and left for work. There would be a meeting today with several smaller gangs on their progress.  
  
My personal war with the Royals had been going well, both my own Ghosts and the several smaller gangs now under my orders had been striking hard and effectively. The Royals had had their operations ruined and their men slaughtered. I could feel the end of the conflict approaching.  
  
That didn't make me as happy as it once would have.  
  
A short while later found me sitting at my desk, drinking a hot coffee in silence.  
  
Dear God, I hated the silence.  
  
Because for me, it never really was silent. Moe's words haunted me. I knew they were imagined, nothing more than the torturous product of my own guilt, but that knowledge didn't stop me from hearing the vicious accusations hurled at me in the confines of my own head.  
  
*Murderer, arrogant fool, selfish, bastard, I hate you IhateyouIhateyouIhateyou...*  
  
I grimaced, determinedly ignoring the whispers.  
  
*You killed us, killed John, killed me, your fault, all your fault*  
  
"Shut *up*." I snarled, voice low.  
  
"Uh...Sir?" The hesitant voice of Jacob Mageo, my number two, broke me out of my reverie. "Is everything okay?"  
  
"What is it?" I snapped, eager to move on and prevent him focusing on the mistake. I didn't want rumors of me talking to myself to get around. I couldn't use the stone on everybody. Which meant that I had to be in control for real, and for me to be in control I needed everyone to believe that I was the best. Our success in bringing in a few of the minor gangs and the war against the Royals was doing a lot in maintaining that reputation. If my people began to think I was going crazy, hearing voices, they would turn on me in a flash.  
  
"The Sixthers have arrived."  
  
Right. I took the moment to gather myself after the slipup. "Send them in."  
  
The Sixthers walked in a moment later. There were three of them. Two short, one tall. They wore different clothes, but each had the signature Sixther green somewhere on their persons. The shorter ones looked a little intimidated, but the third gave off a smug, confident air. I picked him off as an important member of the gang, possibly even the leader, although it was unlikely that he trusted me enough for that. Gang leaders as a rule tend towards paranoia. I noticed with annoyance that there were only two chairs prepared. I signaled to one of the guards standing in the entrance.  
  
"Get another chair." I hissed when he was close enough. The guard looked confused.  
  
"But sir, there's only t—"  
  
I cut him off. "Get another chair immediately, you dolt! Stop making excuses!" The guard, still looking a little confused for some reason, rushed off. I looked back and saw the Sixthers watching curiously.  
  
I gave them a forced smile. "Sorry about that." The two shorter ones nodded slowly. The tall one, to my great annoyance, gave a small snort. Fine. If they were planning to show disrespect, I would disrespect them right back. I sat down, and gestured to them to take their own seats. That would leave one of them forced to stand. Let them decide which of them is least important. I raised an eyebrow as both of the shorter members sat down, leaving the tall confident one standing. Maybe he wasn't the leader of this group after all.  
  
"So," I began. "You requested a meeting. I trust everything has gone well?" The two seated members gave each other a look, before one of them cleared his throat.  
  
"Yes...we have some important news." He cleared his throat again. "On our last hit, we managed to learn something. We decided to bring it straight to you. We know where Daniel Withers will be one day from now."  
  
Daniel Withers. Head of the Royals for the last fifteen years. The man behind some of the biggest moves made in this city. A genius. The Royals gained their half of the city from a previous gang under Daniels rule. The man who was behind the death of John. Who had just killed Moe while trying to kill me, less than a month ago. Well. Perhaps it was time to return the favor.  
  
"How certain are you?" I kept my face smooth of emotion. No doubt the the two were aware of how I felt about the news, but that was no reason to lose control.  
  
"Very." The Sixther smiled. "We snagged one of their higher ups, and asked him a few questions."  
  
"You ... asked him?"  
  
The smile on the Sixthers face grew nasty. "We were *very* persuasive." I chuckled.  
  
"So? Where will he be?" I leaned forward, despite attempts to control my eagerness.  
  
"In twenty-four hours, Daniel will be in one of his safe houses. A farmhouse on the edges of the city. IThere will be some guards, but not too many to handle. Not many know about the safehouse so he can't bring too many bodyguards."  
  
"Well then. Give the direct coordinates to Jacob." I leaned back in my chair. "Thank you for the information. Rest assured, this contribution shall not be forgotten. When I rule, you will be rewarded. Is that all?" The two Sixthers nodded. "Then Jacob will see you out." Jacob, who had been listening at the door, entered the room to escort the two gangsters. "And Jacob?" He paused. "When they have left, we have a strike to plan." He nodded.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
In and out I breathed. Keeping control of your breathing is an important step to keeping control of yourself. I had been on many strikes. The nervousness never really left though. I feel it every time, and I felt it tonight.  
  
It was the night after the meeting with the Sixthers. I and twenty hand selected members of the Golden Ghosts surrounded the house, out of sight of the watchmen. I peeked out through a pair of binoculars, and began to count the guards. In various positions around the front and back of the house, my count was twelve guards. I turned to Jacob who stood peering through his own set of binoculars. Noticing me looking at him, he put them down.  
  
"Twelve guards." I said. "We should be able to handle that easily-  
  
"Twelve?" Jacob interrupted. "There are only eleven guards."  
  
"What?" I snapped. "There are twe-" I paused and checked again. Only eleven guards. Why did I think there were twelve?  
  
No matter.  
  
"We can take them out easily. But there are almost certainly some on the inside as well. They'll be alerted by the gun shots." It took a moment before I gave in and decided on the obvious choice. Those guards were within sight, which meant they could be controlled by the stone. I pulled the damn thing from my pocket with a sigh. I had begun to hate using it. "I know what to do." Jacob nodded. He did that a lot. Didn't talk much. He was so different from how he used to be. It was almost as if the stone muted him. Took away what made him him. I wondered, if it did that to the victim, what did it do the one who used the stone? The handshake with the Dealmaker flashed through my mind, unbidden. More and more I regretted ever contacting that ...demon, or whatever he was.  
  
I shook my head. No time to reminisce. I had a gang leader to catch. I looked through the binoculars again, and focused on a guard near the entrance to the farmhouse.  
  
**"Go into the house. Kill any guards you can, silently. Do not kill them if you won't be able to do it without attracting attention. Return when you have finished."** The guards' face went slack, before a horrifying grin slid onto his face. A moment later, the smile was gone, the face blank. The guard turned, and entered the farmhouse.  
  
I gave the guard a few minutes to work. Then I focused on a pair of guards idling behind the others.  
  
**"Kill the guards."** After the smile disappeared from their faces, the two men pulled out handguns and opened fire on their friends. One guard went down. The remaining Royals turned and began to trade fire with my stone controlled allies. They didn't last long, in the end only taking out one more guard before being killed themselves. That left five guards left standing.  
  
Not that it mattered. Their backs were turned. While they were in the middle of their brief firefight, I had given the order over radio to begin our assault.  
  
While the Royals were still shaken from their comrades betrayal, a hail of bullets from my gang gunned them down.  
  
We left our hiding places and moved towards the house. After reaching, I paused for a moment and signaled everyone to wait. I would give a few more moments to see if the Royal I had commandeered would return. Less than thirty seconds later, a bloody man exited the house. Seeing me, he walked towards me, stopping three feet away. Waiting for more orders.  
  
"Are they dead?" I asked.  
  
He nodded. "I killed three guards throughout the house. The Head is in the master bedroom, he has two guards in front of the door. They are alert after hearing the gunfire." I smiled.  
  
"Good." Then I shot him.  
  
His body crumpled to the floor in silence.  
  
"David, Pierre." I commanded. "Take four men and go watch the window outside. Make sure no one escapes." I paused for a moment, in thought. I gestured to two of my men. "Lead the way."  
  
We entered cautiously, and slowly made our way up the stairs. When we reached the top, a gunshot sounded and one of my lead men dropped, I glanced around quickly, and managed to catch sight of two furious looking men.  
  
**"Stop!"** I yelled, and the men froze. I took great pleasure in shooting their smiles off their faces. Pushing aside the remaining man in front of me, I moved for the master bedroom.  
  
I checked the handle. Locked. I motioned the remaining lead man, a seven foot guy built like a tank. He smirked, and with a crash, kicked the door in.  
  
Silence.  
  
I rushed into the room. My breath froze in my lungs. There he was. The Dealmaker. He sat in a seat shaped like a throne. The room cast a deep shadow over the throne, hiding his face. But it did not conceal the gleaming red eyes fixing me to the floor with the strength of its piercing glare.  
  
"Well?" the Dealmaker asked. I frowned. The voice was pitched too high, and expressed a weariness the Dealmaker had never shown. That wasn't the Dealmaker. I blinked. And in an instant the room changed slightly. The red eyes disappeared, and the shadows lightened so I could make out the face.  
  
"I suppose, " Daniel Withers continued in his tired voice. "You intend to kill me now?" Something about the way he spoke made me furious, more angry than I already was. He sounded so tired, as if the whole situation wearied him. Was that all this was to him? Tiring? The attempt on my life? Killing my friends? It tired him?! I almost shot him on the spot, but I restrained myself.  
  
"No." I said, the word coming out as a hiss. Daniel blinked, and I exulted in surprising him. "I have better plans for you."  
  
Jacob came up behind me. "What do you want to do?"  
  
"We're going to give him a public execution. In front of all the gangs of **\[REDACTED\]**." I smirked. "Hell, maybe we'll even give him a little trial."  
  
**murderer. bastard. you killed me, not him. i will not forget...**  
  
Moe's voice made my blood run cold. I had hoped this would satisfy the guilt I felt. That I would stop torturing myself.  
  
**ihateyouihateyouihateyou...**  
  
Perhaps not.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
*Boom*  
  
The sound of my 1911 broke the air in the empty shooting range and my target, a printed picture of Daniel Withers, shook as the bullet tore through the head. I had had the target made while waiting for the gangs to respond to my messages. I needed to gather as many as I could for my execution. It was then that I would take my place as head of all the gangs of \[REDACTED\], as well as take my revenge on the bastard who killed my friends.  
  
*Boom Boom Boom*  
  
The bullets tore the paper to shreds as I hit the head three more times. The practice wasn't all that necessary, but it did feel good.  
  
Out of the corner of my eye I noticed Jacob walking hurriedly towards me. I put down the gun, and removed my hearing protection. When he reached me, I saw his nervous face and cursed inwardly. This couldn't be good.  
  
"Sir." He swallowed. "It's Daniel."  
  
"What about him?" I snapped, fear starting to rise up in me.  
  
"He escaped." Jacob lowered his eyes.  
  
"WHAT?" I screamed, enraged. "He can't be gone, I need him!" I paced angrily for a moment.  
  
"Be in my meeting room in fifteen minutes. We need to handle this quickly." I stalked off, searching for a nearby guard. Finding one, I motioned for him to come closer.  
  
"Go and tell my other two commanders to be in my meeting room as soon as possible for an urgent meeting." The guard rushed off to do as ordered, and I stood there for a moment, despairing at the unfairness of it all. After giving myself a few moments of self pity, I too rushed to the meeting room.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
"What. The hell. Happened." The words come as if each were bitten off. Short. Stoccato. They are accompanied by my best glare. My three commanders, the men I put in charge of the various subsets of my gang, all deeply under the stones power, stare back at me, confused. Except for Jacob, who just stares.  
  
"The escape?" I ask sharply. "Daniel Withers? No longer in our custody?" Still nothing but blank looks. "Why are you all looking at me like that?" I demand. "Do none of you know?" The commanders except for Jacob exchange glances. Finally, one of them, a man named Jack Baker, stepped forward.  
  
"Sir," He began hesitantly. "You put me in charge of having Daniel watched. I got a status report ten minutes before the meeting started." He glanced nervously at me. "He's still there." I gritted my teeth.  
  
"Then your men are lying. Hiding the truth because they're frightened." I pointed at Jacob. "Jacob himself told me about this!" Jack stared at my pointing finger. He cocked his head.  
  
"Sir?" He asked. "What are you pointing at?"  
  
The door burst open, revealing a slightly out of breath Jacob Mageo.  
  
"Sir! Why wasn't I told about the meeting? What's going on!" He shouted. I stood frozen, shock as cold as anything I had ever felt coursing through my veins. I turned my head slowly from the Jacon in the doorway to the one standing less than five feet away. He looked me dead in the eye. Winked. And vanished.  
  
Suddenly, a rush of memories from the last few weeks filled my vision as I stood paralysed with fear.  
  
*What are you pointing at?*  
  
Flash  
  
*There are only eleven guards*  
  
Flash  
  
*Get another chair*  
  
*a confused guard*  
  
*But sir, there's only t-*  
  
Flash.  
  
Two. He had been going to say there were only two sixthers. Suddenly all the pieces fit together.  
  
I had gone mad. Seeing people who aren't there. Hearing voices. How much of what had happened in the last few weeks had been real? The terror turned deeper as I realized the truth.  
  
*I had no way to know.*

I ripped the stone from my pockets. 

"*It's your fault!"* I screamed, my voice high pitched from the fear and rage. I threw the stone on the floor, and pulled out my gun. "I'm done falling for your tricks, Dealmaker! You hear me? Done!"

*Boom*

My bullet, fired from only a few feet away, splintered the stone into dust. The three commanders stared, shocked. 

*Murderer*

*It was still here.* The voice wasn't gone. It was still here. Why was it still here? I collapsed against the wall and slumped to the floor. I knew why it hadn't left. 

It hadn't been the stone. I was just...

Crazy.

"What the *fuck* did you do to us?" I looked up into Jacob Mageos face, his eyes filled with anger. I paled. I had broken the stone. I looked behind him and saw my other two commanders with similarly angry expressions. Which had apparently freed them from my control.

"I said," Jacob repeated menacingly. "What did you *do*?" Was this actually happening? Maybe this was an illusion. Maybe this Jacob would fade away just like the other one had.

His fist crushed my jaw. I scraped the wall as I was flung sideways against it. 

"You killed Charlie, whatever the fuck you are." His boot slammed into my stomach. I threw up. "He was a good boss." A foot slammed down on my knee with a loud crack. I screamed in agony. 

"I never liked you." Jack said conversationally. He kicked my broken knee. "Actually, I hated you." 

Was this real? Was I imagining all this, only to wake up unharmed in my bed? I lay there, pain clouding my mind, still unable to know what was real. 

I was still questioning as Jacob began to choke me, and the light began to fade from my eyes.

In the corner of my eye, I thought I saw the Dealmaker leaning against a wall. 

Laughing.

Or was that a hallucination? 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
Oh my. 

He was a crazy one. 

You are probably wondering how much of that was my doing. I'm eager to brag, so I'll tell you.

The smile.

That's it. Harry was incredibly paranoid, and his mind was always on the verge of collapse. Considering his lifestyle as a gang member, and his ambitions, he was always on the verge of completely losing it. All it took was the smile to throw him off the edge.

And forcing him to shake my hand, of course. That wore quite a bit at his paranoia, needlessly worrying about what that meant. Never considering whether it had meant nothing at all. 

Goodbye and thousand curses upon your mortal heads.

*I am the Dealmaker.*  
  
*I make deals with people.*  
  
*And if you are very unlucky, I just might make a deal with you too*.
