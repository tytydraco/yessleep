Where I grew up, the birds told stories and mice painted on the walls of our basement.
Dirt tasted like cinnamon and the air smelled sweet.
I can’t remember before or after this place.

I used to play in the yard on sunny days.
The temperature was always perfect—a warmth that felt frictionless.
I walked barefoot through the lawn with curled toes, gripping footfuls of grass and ripping them from the earth with each step.
A path of footprint-sized divots in the untouched green curved and wandered, overlapping and retracing itself like absentminded doodles.

Bushes grew along the walls of the house in canopies of circular leaves that draped down to form small dens where I hid.
Inside, I plucked blades of grass and tore them into thin ribbons.
When snow covered the yard, I would pack it into large mounds and carefully carve out spaces to climb into and sit.

Birds that perched in the trees wove tales through crisp melodies in a language alien to me, though I still listened as I played.
They were not the only ones to inhabit my world. 

Unseen in the basement, little artists were at work.
They’d dart around the peripheries of my room at night, small shapes that never lingered long enough for me to know them.

I called them mice.
And the mice spoke in a language I knew well, one made up entirely of visual compositions.
Along the bottom half of my basement walls, they created breathtaking murals.

On nights when the air turned bitter and the house draped over me in yellow light, I crept down the basement stairs to have a peek.
All would be quiet until I flicked the light switch. 
Steps groaned under each tiptoe down, and I tasted cinnamon as dirt lifted into the air on my approach to the wall.
Then, lowering myself onto my stomach, 
the painting came into full view.

Those nights spent viewing the paintings are most vivid in my memory.
It was finished every time I trekked down to look, and no matter how complete it appeared to be, I would always return to a wholly new piece.
I never thought to try and unveil this mystery.
So I treated their presence like a glass vase and moved carefully.

There were times I looked at a single inch of the mural for hours trying to figure out how it fit into the rest.
I never was able to grasp what they were getting at.
I learned to live with that and let the colors and forms wash through me, to feel whatever I felt and be content with that.

The mice constantly experimented with style, moving through different modalities of painting.
I used to take art history books down with me to try and place their influences.

Some years, they stuck entirely to impressionism.
Each scene drifted in and out of representation, the mural flowing over and around itself in waves of pulsating blues and purples, cut through by faint reds and vivid yellows.

Other years they delved entirely into cubism with hard lines that intersected three-dimensional objects, cracking them into fragmented shapes.
Everything came together only to contradict itself.
A maze of primary colors, black lines and spanning blocks of pure white dissected form while still telling a story.

I was surprised when they started to paint realistically.
Human figures danced in forests of heightless trees, their faces rendered so delicately accurate that their irises seemed to reflect everything held in their gaze.
The trees created a labyrinth that spanned the wall with scenes interweaved between.
That piece made me forget I was lying on my basement floor.
When it appeared, I spent days down there.

After a while, they painted in a wholly original aesthetic that didn’t resemble anything I had seen, yet it felt deliberate.
New, but successful in a way that felt historic.

Then one day, I went down the basement steps and what was left on my wall surpassed anything they made prior.
I couldn’t tear myself away from it.
I spent weeks down there just looking at it.
Refraining from eating, and forcing myself through sleep’s seduction.

I just lay there, staring, exploring it over and over again.
However many times I followed the painting around the periphery of my basement, I was never satiated. 
There was nothing else worth looking at.

Exhaustion overtook me and, to my horror, I felt my eyelids become heavier.
It started slowly; every couple of minutes my eyes would close and I’d slip into sleep before jolting back awake.
Minutes became seconds, then in a great betrayal, my body took away my entire world.

I slept.

When I woke, the mural was gone.
Painted over.
I checked every inch of wall to see if there were any remnants of the painting.
But not even a centimeter of color was left.
I tore at the wall, trying to scratch off the layer of paint hiding what they created.
But my nails were imperfect tools and dug too deep.
I felt wretched as the fleck of paint drifted to the floor.
My stomach twisted and I started to sob.
Something across the room cast a line and caught my eye.

In the corner of my basement, still as stone, lay a mouse.
I inspected it closely.
Its body was frail, but there was something about its hands.
I can’t tell if it was my mind seeing what it wanted to see, but its hands looked almost human.
Most mice have hands like that.

It was dead.
And after that, no paint was ever added to the basement wall again.
