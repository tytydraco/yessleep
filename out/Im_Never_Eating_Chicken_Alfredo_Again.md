Hello, everyone. For context, I recently had a bizarre encounter with a friend of mine from school. I'm posting here because the police won't give us any answers. I'm going to post the transcript from my interview with a police officer below, I'm too disgusted to think about it all again.

**DEP: Hello, I'm Deputy ███████ █████. I've asked that your mother remain in the other room, but she can listen to our conversation. Is that okay?** 

Yes, that's fine.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Before we get into any details, can you remember the events leading up to the incident?**

It started when I got a text from my friend, ████, asking me to come over and stay for dinner. I said "sure,” and got ready to go. I got my shoes on, and drove for about 30 minutes to his house. I guess I thought it was weird that ████ never invited me over before, we’ve been friends for like 2 years. I guess now I know why.

&#x200B;

**DEP: How would you describe the relationship between your friend and his parents before this incident?**

Well, before then I'd never seen his parents, but me and ████ are pretty good friends. We play video games online a lot.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Okay, now tell me the story again.**

Well, I stepped outside the car and knocked on the door. It was ████’s mom who opened the door. She just told me that ████ didn't tell her I was coming over. I think I just apologized and went upstairs to see him.

&#x200B;

**DEP: What was ████'s house like? Did you notice anything strange?**

No, nothing strange aside from a few cardboard boxes. It seemed like they had recently moved in, or maybe they were packing up. ████ didn't mention anything about moving. Overall, it was a clean, ordinary-looking house.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Okay, continue please.**

I opened ████’s door. His room was mostly clean, minus a few dirty clothes here and there. We sat down, played video games for a while. I noticed a container of microwaved chicken alfredo laying on his desk. I don’t know what it was, but something about that really put me off. It looked like it had probably been sitting out for a while. I didn’t say anything about it to him. 

&#x200B;

Later, my controller died. He told me he was going to go get the charger out of his closet. When he opened the door, I was actually disgusted at what I saw. I counted six, maybe seven containers of chicken alfredo. I asked him, kind of as a joke, “Dude, do you ever clean your room?” He said something like he lost track of time and didn't get to clean up. I felt bad for pointing it out, but I was genuinely concerned.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Has ████ displayed any unusual behavior before this incident?**

No. Nothing at all. He's a funny, really nice guy. Nobody ever has anything bad to say about him.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Alright. At what point did the incident occur?**

I heard ████'s mom call us down for dinner. He didn't seem to notice, so I pointed it out to him. Honestly, I was relieved. I didn’t want to spend much more time in his room since I was starting to feel nauseous. I ran downstairs, but he seemed hesitant. We both sat down at the dinner table. This was the first time I saw ████’s dad. He was a very ordinary looking guy. Honestly, he looked... he looked like someone you’d see in one of those stock images online. Then I looked over at ████’s mom who was preparing dinner. I instantly lost my appetite. She was preparing microwaved chicken alfredo for dinner. I was really grossed out at this point. She already microwaved three of them, and this was the last one.

\[pause\]

Sorry.

&#x200B;

**DEP: It's alright. Please continue.**

She walked over to the table, and I expected her to put the tray in front of me. She instead placed it in front of ████’s dad. She walked back and grabbed another, and placed it in front of ████’s dad again. She carried two more, both of them to ████’s dad. We just watched as he scarfed down all four of them. I was hypnotized by it. Before I got a chance to get up and go to the bathroom or something, ████'s mom put four plates onto the table, She put two of them in front of ████'s dad. 

After that he... Well, his eyes rolled back into his head and he opened his mouth, vomiting like he was some kind of bird regurgitating its food. The whole family was vomiting onto their plates. I stood up from the table in some kind of fight-or-flight response. All the ingredients of the chicken alfredo were coming out of their mouths: noodles, chicken, broccoli, but it was all coated in a weird, gelatinous goo that made the whole room smell like saliva. They all started eating it. ████’s mom looked up at me. She smiled, and I swear she said, "Vinny's a big hit in this family. You'll love it."

&#x200B;

**DEP: Could you please elaborate on this... "Vinny?"**

I have no idea what she meant by that... Maybe that's what they call that meal or something. I really don't want to think about it anymore.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Did ████ or any of his family members acknowledge anything strange about this dinner?**

No, it seemed like everything was normal to them.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Were you under the influence of any kind of drugs or alcohol during these events or at any point leading up to these events?**

No, sir... I know it sounds crazy, but I promise you, everything that I told you is true. ████ is one of my best friends. I would never make something like this up.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Okay, what happened after that?**

Well, ████'s mom put one of those plates in front of me. At that point, I just vomited all over the table. I ran out the front door. I didn't even shut it. I ran to my car and drove, I don't even know where I was going. After that, I pulled over and called my mom. She couldn't understand me over the phone, so I went home and explained what happened. She thought I was crazy. That's when I decided to call the police.

&#x200B;

**DEP: We visited the ████████ family after your call. They denied the fact that anything strange occurred there.**

I know what I saw in that house. You can't make something like this up.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Did you seek any medical or psychological assistance following the incident?**

\[pause\]

No, sir, not yet. I swear, I'm not crazy.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Is there anything else you'd like to add?**

No, sir. That's everything I saw.

&#x200B;

**DEP: Okay. The time is 7:19 PM. This concludes the interview.**

To be honest, I'm really worried about my friend. I haven't seen him since we called the police. I just want to know what in God's name happened that night. I know this all sounds so insane, but has anyone ever heard of anything like this? I can't sleep at night anymore, I just can't stop thinking about it.
