
I noticed it three weeks ago. A small patch on my left forearm below the elbow felt tight, stretched too thin over the muscle. I thought it was a bruise or maybe I slept on it wrong. Up close it wasn’t discolored, just smooth and shiny. I pressed it and it didn’t give like normal skin. It felt hard like polished wood. I’m not a doctor, no insurance, so I ignored it hoping it’d fade. It didn’t. By morning that patch spread up my arm, a slow tide of glossy flesh swallowing hairs and freckles. It didn’t hurt, that’s the worst part. It just changed me.

Two days later I woke up to no fingernails. Not fallen off, gone. My fingertips were sealed with that smooth hard skin. I clawed at it with my other hand but my remaining nails scraped uselessly. I grabbed a kitchen knife and pressed it to my finger, desperate to cut it open, to find blood or bone. The blade skidded off like I tried slicing marble. I sawed harder until the handle splintered. Nothing, not a mark. That’s when I cried, not from pain, I wish it was pain, but because I was losing myself piece by piece with no way to stop it.

By the end of the week it reached my shoulders. My arms looked like a mannequin’s, rigid and lifeless, but I could still move them a little. Every motion felt like bending plastic till it cracks. Then my chest changed. In the bathroom mirror shirtless I watched my ribcage vanish under that glassy shell. My breathing turned shallow, not failing lungs, but a torso that wouldn’t expand. I pressed my ear to my chest and heard my heart thump faint and trapped like in a locked box. I stopped going out. My neck stiffened, jaw locking, lips fusing into a glossy grimace. I couldn’t eat solids, just broth through a straw, and even that’s fading.

Last night I woke to my voice, a low moan, not from my mouth but my stomach. I tore off the blanket and stared. The skin there, perfect and unblemished, rippled like something pushed inside. I pressed my clawless hand against it and felt a pulse, not mine, something else. I watched for hours as the ripples grew. Then a split appeared, a thin bloodless seam across my abdomen. It widened, smelling sour and wet like spoiled meat. I looked inside, no muscle, no organs, just a dark glistening hollow with something shifting in the shadows, alive and watching me.

It was my face, my real face, inside. Eyes wide and wet, mouth stretched in a silent scream, pressed against the underside of this shell trying to break free. It saw me, locking eyes, and I felt tears I couldn’t shed. I don’t know what’s happening, if this skin is alive or making room for something worse. I’m still here trapped, my memories slipping, Mom’s voice, rain’s smell, my dog’s nudge, gone. The split’s wider now. Pale slick tendrils coil inside pulling what’s left of me deeper. I can’t move much, just type this with two bending fingers begging someone to read it before I vanish completely.

If you find me, if anything’s left, don’t touch me. Don’t let this spread. I don’t know what it is but it’s not done. It’s still growing, hungry.
