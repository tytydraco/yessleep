I started working at my engineering firm about a year ago, and until recently everything was going really well. My co-workers and I got along well, I got to do interesting work on behalf of local municipalities, and my boss Mr. Tingly was knowledgeable and patient even though I was a recent grad and I sometimes made errors in the specs I drafted.

But lately, things have gotten strange and I'm not sure if I'll be employed here much longer.

The troubles started after I'd been with the firm about nine months. That's when I received one of those "mailbox size limit" messages telling me I had used up more than seventy percent of my mailbox space. A lot of the specs I work on are rather lengthy PDF's, so the space gets used up fast.

Within minutes of receiving that first message, one of the guys from the IT department called me. "You need to delete some stuff from your email," he said. "It's really important." I told him I'd get around to it, but since I still had 30% of my email space left I didn't bother. Fucking IT trying to justify their existence, I thought. The company should just outsource the whole department. I'd been down there before, to the basement, and seen what those IT guys were like. Arrogant, humorless, convinced of their own brilliance. Like engineers, only worse.

I didn't give it much thought, and the next few weeks I was inundated with work on a new county bridge. I had to coordinate with geotechnical experts and the county engineer was a tough taskmaster, so I didn't have much time to even see my fiancee Brynn, let alone take the time to delete old emails. But when my email box got to 80%, I received another warning. This time, along with the message, there was a picture of a jester-like character, red eyes and blood dripping from its teeth. "Mailbox Size Limit Nearly Exceeded," the message said. "Don't say you weren't warned." In the jester's hand was a cartoonish butcher knife with blood dripping from it.

This time I approached the IT bros first.

"What's with the psycho message?" I said to their leader. His name was Warren, and he looked like a Warren.

"You need to delete some emails," Warren intoned, not lifting his eyes from his computer.

"That image wasn't cool," I said, having half a mind to go to HR. "What's your problem?"

"There's no problem here," Warren said. "Just make sure you practice good mailbox hygiene from now on."

Now I was pissed. So pissed off that I didn't clean up my emails out of spite. And every few minutes I kept getting vanilla, non-threatening messages stating I was approaching my mailbox limit, which of course was not only annoying, but also increased the size of my mailbox.

A few days later, I was out with some of the other engineers at happy hour, and I off-hand mentioned the issue I was having with the IT bros and my mailbox limit. "Oh yeah," my office friend Brian said. He and I had started at the firm around the same time. "I got a message saying I was at 70% a while back, so I made sure I moved some of my stuff to the cloud."

"Fuck that," I said. "Warren and his IT drones can wait until the second coming for all I care, there's no way I'm going to delete any emails."

"I don't think that's advised," Sarah, one of the more senior engineers said. "The firm really takes that kind of stuff seriously. In fact," she continued, "I can't think of anything we take more seriously."

It seemed like a joke; had to be. Yet I couldn't tell if Sarah was being jokey-cryptic or *cryptic*, cryptic. It was actually a bit unnerving, but My fiancee Brynn called at that moment, breaking my concentration. I cancelled the call and went back to the bar to order another Jameson on the rocks. Brynn had been a bit clingy lately, having failed to find an engineering job after college. She was working part-time waiting tables at a local restaurant and was constantly calling and texting me during my work hours. After that, the rest of the evening was normal as ever and I didn't mention the email situation again and nobody else brought it up.

A few days after that I had to work late again. This time for real, not for happy hour. While I was rummaging through the office's basement, attempting to locate blueprints from an old courthouse project, I stumbled upon a door blocked by an old filing cabinet. Some morbid curiosity caused me to  push aside the cabinet and see what was behind it. It led to a closet-sized room with more storage. There were redwells and other files piled up on wire racks, and also a bunch of moldering boxes. Poking out from one of the boxes, located on the top shelf, were the belled edges of a jester's hat. I was attempting to reach for the box when Warren appeared behind me.

"Looking for something?" he asked.

"What's in that box up there?" I asked. "It looks like your little jester email narc."

"Those are the firm's costumes," Warren said. "They're not for you. Or at least you should hope not." I bristled at that. It was dingy in there, but I could almost detect a sick gleam in his eyes.

"You delete those emails?" he asked.

"Haven't had time to get around to it yet," I said.

"Well you better do it soon," Warren said. "Or you'll be out of time."

I asked him what that was supposed to mean, but he just retreated from the doorway.

After that I went straight to HR. I didn't want to bother Mr. Tingley with such nonsense.

"Oh dear," Brenda the HR Director said. She was a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and a photo on her desk of her with her two teenage sons, and a big labradoodle. "That must have been alarming," she said.

"More like a hostile working environment," I replied. She nodded, and for the first time I felt truly understood by the firm regarding the silly email issue.

"But," she continued, absently sharpening a pencil by hand. "Warren's just trying to do his job, making sure you remember to save hard-drive space, just like it's your job to delete unnecessary emails or to move them to the cloud. In fact," she continued, "I bet if you asked Warren nicely, someone from his department could help you with moving your old emails over to the cloud server today."

"I just don't think it's appropriate to threaten someone because they don't get around to deleting emails," I said, feeling like I was suddenly talking to a martian. "Is that too much to ask?"

"Well, it may very well be," Brenda said without inflection. "As you've probably heard, this office takes proper technological hygiene very seriously."

The next day my mail box reached 90%. I received a message stating I only had 10 GB's left along with an image of a bloodied jester mask. There was a link this time, which simply read: "Final Warning." When I clicked on it, I was redirected to what I could only call a snuff film. In greenish, grainy footage I saw a young woman being stabbed by multiple costumed-wearing hooligans.  One of the costumed people was a jester, but there was also a devil costume, a generic demon costume, a clown, and something that slightly resembled Grimace from McDonalds, though it was not him.

"Please," the young woman screamed in the video. "Help me!"

"You were told to clean up your mailbox," an angry male voice hissed. "How many times did we fucking warn you!" The video dissolved to the woman then being tied up, in what appeared to be the basement of our engineering firm, and being set on fire. Her screams were blood-curdling. Then the video ended and the video and the link disappeared. At that moment, Mr. Tingley appeared at my door.

"Hey, Billy Budd," he said.

"Ahhh," I said, jumping up from my office chair. "I mean, hi-yaaa, Mr. Tingley..."

"Just checking in to see how the Main Street bridge demolition project is coming along." He ran his right hand through his graying beard. "Wouldn't want to see that project get off track," he said.

"No, no," I replied. "Of course. But actually, something else has been going on and I'm not sure who to turn to here. Would you mind chatting back in your office?"

He checked his watch. "I suppose I have the time if you do," he replied. As I got up to follow him out of the room, the familiar ringing sound of new emails assaulted my ears. I looked at my computer and it was warning after warning after warning.

My mailbox was just about full.

&#x200B;

The first thing I noticed when I took a seat in Mr. Tingley's office was the box: the one from the basement with the jester hat sliding off the side. He followed my eyes to it and said: "You caught me, I moonlight as a jester. How embarrassing." He laughed and cracked his knuckles on his left hand. "Just kidding, those are just props for a non-profit event we'll be hosting next week. I always say, anything for a kids' charity. But any-who, you said you wanted to talk to me about something?"

I didn't respond. I couldn't respond. I wanted to take out my phone and call the police, or at least text Brynn in case something happened, but I felt sort of paranoid for feeling such sudden terror. I mean, I worked at a respected local engineering firm. We built schools and civic centers and fucking churches. My co-workers weren't actually murderers. No, it was just Warren's sick sense of humor paired with coincidence and my own growing paranoia. Right? All this was going through my head when Mr. Tingley said: "Is it something personal you wish to discuss? I'm here to talk, you know. Even if it's not work related."

"I'd...like to request a larger email box," I said, studying his face for any tells. None.

"Well, the firm distributes email box sizes based on a number of factors, including seniority in title. If you last with us a few more years, then you'll be eligible for a storage upgrade." He leaned back in his chair and took a long sip of coffee from a mug that read: *I'm not civil, but my engineering is.*

"And I'm sure you will," Mr. Tingley added. "We really like you here, and we hope you feel the same."

"Of course," I said. "Of course I do."

"Great," he said, standing up and placing his mug down. "Then how about you get back to clearing out the email box you do have," Mr. Tingley said. Then he winked, or at least I think he winked, and slowly walked me to the door.

&#x200B;

When I returned to my office I decided to delete my emails. Half of me felt like I was about to star in the next office snuff film, and the other half felt it was some cruel hazing ritual, or simply my own paranoia, but I didn't want to find out which was which. I sat down at my desk and started searching for a large email to delete when I received the familiar ding sound.

"You have used up 100% of your available email space," the message read. "You are so totally, sincerely, and hopelessly fucked." The message was written in a smeared, red font as though part of a horror movie.

Before that moment, I never really knew what the expression "heart in your throat" meant. But I felt it then, my heart was in my throat and about to be out of it, too. As I quickly gathered up my keys and my laptop bag, I started to hear an odd, bell-like jingling from down the hall.

The jester hat!

I made my way outside my office and to the hallway. There I saw a large, cloaked man with a pitchfork and a devil's mask rushing toward me. He had the same scuffed dress shoes as Mr. Tingley.

"You were fucking warned, you fucking jagoff!" the Devil-costumed man said. "Now look what you've made us do." The jingling was getting closer and then a jester with a white and red painted face rounded the corner and she stabbed at me with a pencil. I ripped away from them and rushed toward the lobby as other demonic co-workers appeared in full masquerade garb.

"He's getting away," the Devil shouted. "Quick you fucking bozos!" They came at me from all sides, but I used to run track in high school, so I was able to slip them. I made my way outside the office and to my parked Toyota.

When I got home, I called the police, but after they briefly investigated they said there wasn't much they could do. It was an entire office's word against mine, and technically no harm had come to me. Yet.

Pranks aren't against the law if nobody gets hurt, the officer explained. For a moment I thought he was going to chide me for not cleaning out my mailbox.

"Maybe you're just overworked," Brynn said after the police officer left and I locked the apartment door behind him. "I mean, I've barely even seen you the past few months." She rubbed my shoulder, which made me feel a bit better. I had locked all the windows, too, and even I was starting to worry that maybe I was being overly paranoid. I do have that tendency at times. But then I received a text message from an unmarked number which simply read: *We wish to hold a black mass in your honor. If not now, then soon. If not soon, then sooner or later. If not sooner or later, then eventually, eventually.*

When I showed the text to Brynn she just laughed. I told her I didn't think it was funny, that none of this was funny. I didn't see why she would think it was. But just now, after she went to bed, I think I discovered why she might have thought so.

Amongst our pile of bills and junk mail was a new employment contract. Yep, looks like Brynn just accepted a new position with my firm. Civil Engineer I, the same job I currently hold.

I'm typing this now as I watch her sleep. Waiting with the patience of a man about to swat a fly. If she stirs, if she moves, if she so much as opens her eyes, I swear to God I'm going to flee this state like a bat out of hell.

Please pass along the story of what's happened here. I can only hope your email box is not too full to receive it.
