[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ftr0j2/im_a_journalist_who_follows_a_strange_list_of/) – **Part II**

Apologies for the delay, but there was too much to divulge in the initial post. Anyway, I’m finally ready to finish my story. Not that it’s over. It’ll never be over.

Holly’s static voice poured through the car speakers. “You and Andreas are going to get me in trouble.”

“Relax,” I said. “We didn’t discuss anything confidential.”

“Well, what did you discuss?” she asked.

I paused, absorbing the world beyond my windscreen on the way home from the hospital. Driving on the other lane, seeing the countryside in reverse, the road seemed to have a freshly-tarmacked personality. It felt different than before. Felt backwards in more than a literal sense. As I passed countless grand oaks lining the never-ending lane, I thought of Cedric’s curse. The five rules that he’d bestowed upon me, plus any others the tall crawl might add.

*You’ve lost the fucking plot*, I thought, clammy hands gripping the steering wheel. *There is no tall crawl. I don’t know what you saw in that room, but it wasn’t real. Pull yourself together, Kai.*

There was, however, no denying the scarring tissue on my left arm. The eleven curved wounds. I frantically searched my memory vault. Searched for some memory of Cedric lunging forwards, perhaps, and clawing away at my skin. But he hadn’t. The wounds had been inflicted by the air itself. By invisible strings that the patient skilfully twirled in trained fingers.

“Kai?” Holly asked. “Are you still there?”

“Yes,” I answered weakly. “I, erm…”

“Kai…” she pressed. “Please tell me what you and Cedric discussed so I don’t have to worry about losing my job.”

“Yes, Officer,” I said, trying and failing to lighten the tone — lighten my own tone. “We talked about the price of breaking his rules. He told me that he didn’t want to kill his entire family. He had to kill them.”

Holly sighed. “It’s a horrible case. Are you okay?”

I swallowed my fear. “I’ve interviewed worse people than Cedric Roberts.”

“So have I,” she started, sounding unconvinced, “but he’s a different breed. You know that. I hear it in your voice.”

I did, but I wasn’t going to tell Holly that. Just as I wasn’t going to tell her about the wounds on my arm. She was my friend — more than my friend — but she was also a law enforcer. One who was never really off-duty, no matter how much she claimed otherwise. She sought justice in all areas of life, and I didn’t want her to fight my battle. Didn’t want Mr Roberts to do anything awful to her too.

Besides, I knew I’d see Holly soon enough, and she would wrench the cat out of the bag, no matter how hard I tried to keep it hidden. I just needed time before that inevitable confrontation. Time to figure out what had happened me. Time to figure out whether there might be a rational explanation for what happened in Room 307. An explanation other than it being a supernatural force with mysterious wants.

Not mysterious, I thought. It feeds on attention and control.

Its sustenance came from obedience. From asinine rituals.

1. **Do whatever he bids, and do it twice if you doubt yourself.**
2. **Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour.**
3. **Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**
4. **No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**
5. **Snap the bird when it sings.**

The ink on my palm had smudged from sweat, but I didn’t need the rules in writing any longer. They were floating in my thoughts. Swimmers planted either by my fearful subconscious or the long, spectral fingers that had fiddled with my brain. Had slithered through my screaming lips.

*That wasn’t real*, I lied to myself.

I really wanted to believe those warm, fuzzy fibs as I pulled into my driveway. Really wanted to sleep, most of all, after a half-hour drive that felt eternal. I imagined myself waking up without a single memory of that awful visit to the psychiatric ward. Perhaps waking up without any memory of the Cedric Roberts case. I thought there might be a way to go back. Unbind myself from the tall crawl.

*Not real*, I reminded myself once more as I unlocked the front door.

But bed would wait. I’d forgotten that my younger brother — my housemate — had invited a dozen of our closest friends over for a summer barbecue. Strangely, however, I found that I didn’t mind. There buzzed a soft, cooling frequency in my brain. Not quite a hit of dopamine. More so the release of tension, as if I’d doused my flaming mind with cold water. As if I’d finally tossed aside the hospital-grade belt restraining my thoughts.

I sighed with relief and waved gleefully at my friends as I stepped into the house. I’m such an idiot. I was just having a weird day. That’s all. I bought into Cedric’s tall tale of a tall crawl.

The temporary relief was perforated by a pang of realisation.

**2. Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour.**

I’d just completed a ritual. Unknowingly, perhaps, but that didn’t matter. I’d done as instructed. That was why I felt better.

*Don’t be silly*, I thought whilst greeting each of my friends.

It wasn’t silly. I knew that. That foreboding feeling on the drive home had been a warning. A reminder that I was on the verge of breaking one of the crawl’s laws. I was struggling to wrestle with that notion any longer.

Then I became consumed by one of my oldest fears. The possibility that I might have inherited my late mother’s disorder.

*There’s a genetic link with that illness, after all*, I reminded myself.

But Cedric had been clear. Very clear. This was no illness. The crawl was tangible, though it wore different skins. To disobey it came with hauntingly real consequences, unlike my mother’s illness.

*Her death was pretty fucking real*, I thought.

“Hey, Kai,” Holly said, pulling me out of the trance. “You look a little pale.”

I smiled. “I just forgot about tonight. That’s all.”

She laughed. “Yeah, after you hung up, I realised I should’ve reminded you. I had a feeling you might’ve blanked. People only just got here though, so don’t worry.”

“It’s not that,” I said. “I’m just tired.”

Holly frowned. “Are you really okay, Kai? You said you’d interviewed worse people than Cedric Roberts.”

“I know…” I whispered, lips twitching.

She nodded as if to say that she’d already known. I didn’t bother attempting to tell white lies in front of Holly’s face. She was a detective, after all, and she’d clearly detected something in my voice during the call, given her incessant questioning. It was even harder to shrug her off in the flesh.

I tugged at the sleeve of my jacket, hoping the wounds on my arm were concealed. That was a conversation I did not want to have, much like the Cedric-themed one I knew was coming.

“Did he threaten you?” Holly asked.

“What makes you think that?” I replied.

She said, “He threatened one of my colleagues.”

“Well, no, he didn’t threaten me,” I lied. “He just talked a lot. In great detail.”

Holly nodded, but the frown persisted. I knew she wasn’t buying it. She knew full well that I’d heard numerous horror stories from killers over the years. Heard of the awful things they’d done to other human beings. Cedric’s murderous confession was ghastly, but not the ghastliest. What made him so frightening was the intention behind his actions. The act of serving something beyond the earthly realm. That was certainly new.

I found that I actually wanted to be psychologically unwell. That would have been an easier pill to swallow. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treatable. I didn’t know whether the curse had a cure. It was evident, however, that the tall crawl existed. A force that hungered for nothing but my servitude. It would feast on my undying loyalty.

*And punish any mistake*, I thought, going over the rules in my head.

The night passed in a blur, as did my thoughts. Racing, unintelligible thoughts born of fever daydreams. As hot fear coursed through my blood, I thought of Mum. Knew she’d battled something different, yet not dissimilar. And for the first time ever, I let go of the anger. The blame. She’d been tortured for years. Decades. I was simply amazed that she’d made through it as many days as she did.

“I love you,” she’d promised me only an hour before she ended it all.

A little after one in the morning, I woke in a sweat. It took me fewer than ten seconds to process what was wrong. It wasn’t simply the sound of rustling from downstairs that had woken me. It was an alarm bell ringing from a clotted compartment of my brain. A bell that, amidst all of the neural noise, I’d missed earlier.

**4. No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**

I’d turned off every last light in the house. I was certain of it. But the rule was vague, of course. Intentionally so. Tall crawl gives no clarity. It speaks in riddles. Deceives. Longs for us to fumble, so that it might exact its devious design.

As I tore out of bed, ears throbbing, I was acutely aware of that sensation from the evening before. The warm tension I’d felt during the journey home. The fear that I’d forgotten something.

I checked all of the lights, I thought, heart pounding as I slipped downstairs. Unless I should’ve turned off every single light on the planet. ‘No artificial light’. What does that even mean?

When I made it to the blackened lobby of my house, not daring to flick a single switch, I noticed something. A pinprick of redness spilling out from the black living room. The television’s standby light.

*Fuck*, I thought. *Is that what I missed?*

I realised it had to be. The rest of the house was entirely dark. I’d taken the rule seriously, making sure to inspect every room after our friends had gone home.

I darted into the living room, bludgeoning my shin on the sharp edge of the coffee table, then I dropped to my knees and crawled towards the television stand. I had to kill the red glow.

I rummaged around behind the stand, guided only by moonlight and streetlamps pouring through the lounge’s windows. It didn’t feel sufficient to turn off the switch. I searched for the plug in the extension sockets. I wanted to remove any reasonable doubt.

**4. No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**

But as I dipped my fingers into the entanglement of cables, the flesh on my arms started to shiver. Started to sprout tiny bumps. I let my hand lie still. Stopped searching in the heap of technology for the extension sockets. Then I screamed.

The cables continued moving.

The dark, worm-like clump surged and grew, forming a hunching body. One that seemed to verge on standing, but instead chose to squat in the darkness.

*He looks like so many things*, Cedric had said.

I tried in vain to free my hand and forearm from its snare, but the living cables seized me. Cut into my flesh. Fresh scars formed alongside the bloody dents inflicted by Cedric Roberts, and I was certain, in my peripheral vision, that the red standby light had moved. As if it were the eye of the crawl, watching me from the black.

I thought that would be my end, but there is no end for its servants. Only greater depths of horror.

The cables released me.

I massaged my arm and scooted backwards across the carpet in fear. The cluster of cables did not pursue me. The silhouetted man shrank and sank into the carpet, resting against the wall in a foetal position. Then, to my great surprise, the television’s plug disconnected of its own accord.

The red light faded as its shadowy eyelids shut, and I dragged my shivering body across the floor.

As I moved towards the window, the outside light started to reveal the new marks on my arm. Not meaningless fingernail prints, as had been left by Cedric, but something of significance. Awful words were etched into my flesh.

*Andreas or Holly.*

“I won’t…” I whispered, understanding what it meant.

As if in response, fresh lines formed in my flesh. A word was dashed, and a new one was written above to form a new message.

*Andreas and Holly.*

I did not need clarity, much as I hadn’t needed clarity with the list of rules. I knew that a punishment awaited. It was sinisterly straightforward, actually. I had failed to complete a ritual, much like Cedric, and a bad thing was coming.

Then came the crunch of grass beneath shoes, signalling an approach.

It neared the living room window below which I was slouching against the wall. Each crunch far louder than the last. And then the steps stopped. Something stopped right before the glass pane.

Heart drilling at a brutal beat, I did not hesitate. There was no escaping it. I had to face my fate and be done with it. I shot up and looked out at my front yard.

Of course, there was no-one to be seen.

*He looks like so many things.*

My eyes started to water as I spotted something. Not out of place, for it had never been placed there at all. Andreas and I are not gardeners. Our front yard has always been empty, but there it stood. A small ash tree in the grass. A pale-brown trunk with an unnervingly-flat texture, as if it were skin, not bark. Old and withered skin, perhaps, but skin. And the leaves, neither green nor any natural colour, left me with a wretched feeling in my gut.

Backwards.

I don’t know how to explain it, but the tree was, undoubtedly, backwards. There are no words that make sense of such a thing because it’s an impossibility. Don’t you think I know that? A tree has no front. No back. It was, nonetheless, backwards. Reversed, somehow.

It wasn’t even a tree. That was the terrifying truth I wanted to ignore. As the fleshy bark danced with slight movements, much like the cables, I knew it was the tall crawl. And at the foot of the trunk lay the unconscious bodies of the two people who meant most to me.

Andreas and Holly.

I was supposed to choose, but the options had been stripped from me.

*Your fault for denying him*, I thought.

The urge began. Both of my loved ones would perish at my hand, though I had no say in the matter. It was starting. I was being consumed by the insidious intent that had cursed Cedric. That had forced him to kill his loved ones. And the very same murderous urge hauled me out of the front door in the early, unlit hours of the morning.

There lay a blade on the paved porch, and I bent forwards to scoop it up without a moment’s hesitation. Then I strolled across the grass towards my two loved ones. They lay in foetal bundles, like the cluster of living room cables. Neatly placed in the well-lit grass beside the ash tree’s shadow.

**3. Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**

As I raised the knife, preparing to lunge, I started to wrestle with the urge of the crawl. With that foreign motivation imprinted upon me. I knew I didn’t have to do this. Didn’t have to suffer a punishment for not obeying meaningless rules. Didn’t have to obey the rules at all, in fact.

*It’s weak*, I thought, eyeing the sickly bark of the tree.

And I recalled how fragile and vulnerable the tall crawl had seemed as a resting pile of black cables. Less intimidating than it had been in the hospital room.

*When I disobey, I weaken it*, I realised.

**3. Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**

That rule rang in my mind. I eyed the ash tree’s shadow, which was cast to the side of my two friends. Then I smiled, seeing what I believed to be a way forwards, before taking a well-meaning stride into the shade.

Dread knifed my heart, and a boiling liquid flooded my skull, enveloping me in fear beyond fear. I had willingly defied a rule. Willingly gone against the bidding of the crawl.

1. **Do whatever he bids, and do it twice if you doubt yourself.**

Two rules defied in one fell swoop.

However, that pull remained. That urge to do its bidding. I wasn’t cured.

There followed a sense of freedom, but it drowned in all-consuming terror. I’d felt triumphant upon seeing rot setting into the bark of the tree, but I was shrivelling as painfully as the crawl.

I screamed as my limbs started to snap into jagged, angular formations. I lost any remaining free will, and by the time I accepted that, I’d already lunged down. Already plunged the steel knife into Andreas’ chest.

Plunged again, again, and again.

My brother woke with a splutter, which somehow did not wake Holly, and blood filled his gaping mouth. I sobbed as I lay atop him. Sobbed as I felt the tree shift and creak above us.

“What have I done?” I cried.

“It came through the window,” Andreas whispered, shivering as he eyed the branches above us.

“Holly!” I yelled. “HELP!”

The police officer started to stir, opening her eyes with a shake, then she screamed at the sight of my brother. Screamed at the tree which started to twist and spiral into the dirt.

“I didn’t do it…” I promised, watery eyes begging her to believe me.

Holly knew. Much like Andreas, she’d seen and felt something. Something which contradicted all reason.

“Mum was here,” she whimpered, curling up into a tighter ball on the grass.

I’d never seen her so fragile.

“Holly?” I gently began.

“No…” she said to herself, shaking her head and changing her mind. “It wasn’t her.”

The ground quaked, swallowing the last of the thing pretending to be an ash tree. Swallowing me. Before I had a chance to do a thing, Andreas’ still-alive, though barely, form sank into the grass, joining the tree in some treacherous underworld. I clung to him, hoping to save him. Hoping to suffer with him, at the very least. But the blades of grass closed, sealing him away.

Holly and I dug for an hour, trying to reach him in a blind, traumatised panic, but he was gone.

I had not defeated the tall crawl. To starve it was only the beginning. For when I’d taken one step forwards, defying its law, I took two steps backwards. I fully succumbed to the will of the crawl.

“I murdered him,” I whispered to Holly as the sun dawned.

She shook her head and held me in her arms.

The months since that day have been torturous. I know there is a way out, but I don’t see it. Not yet. I try to remind myself of what I saw. That the tall crawl is not an impervious, omnipotent being, and it certainly does not prevent bad things from happening.

It *causes* them.

I keep telling myself I need the crawl to keep my loved ones safe, but I think my mind has twisted the truth.
