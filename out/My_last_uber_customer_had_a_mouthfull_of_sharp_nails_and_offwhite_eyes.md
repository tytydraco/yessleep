Before I write my story I think I should give a little backstory, I moved from Italy to the united states to visit my wife, and see some friends, but I never was well endowed with money, so I eventually started looking for a well paying job, and having had experience with driving cars, especially taxi's I found a job at Uber, for the first-week driving people I only met amazing kind and eel understanding customers, over the week I began to visit some of my family and friends.

When I arrived it was nighttime before I reached the driveway of my wife's house.

I knocked at the door of my wife's house, I hadn't seen her in about a year. I waited with butterflies in my stomach as I waited for the door to open. when it did I was greeted with the fragrant smell of well-cooked food and the comforting sound of air conditioning. She was so much more beautiful than I could have imagined. I felt warm goosebumps as I wrapped my arms around her in a huge hug, we went inside, and we sat on the couch still hugging.

"Ahmad! I miss you so much" she said finally ending our hug

"Me too, I'm so sorry it took this long for me to come back iris"

I really meant it, even with the financial hardship it took to come to visit her it was 100% worth it.

I looked into her eyes as I told her my plans for my stay.

"I'm planning on getting a job doing taxi services around here," I told her

"Couldn't you find different work, taxi service is so draining for you"

"I know iris, but I need to work hard so that you and I can live the life we have been dreaming about for so long"

"thank you," said iris, I gave her another hug, then looked out of the large glass window.

Iris looked at me with a slight smirk.

"let's go to bed, it's late"

"I think your right iris, it is dark outside" together we walked into the bedroom which was beautifully decorated, and yes...we had the best night of our lives.

The next day, I woke up and after hurriedly scribbling a short note, that said I had left for work and would be back in a couple of hours, I put it on irises blankets, grabbed my car key's and checked the Uber app, where I saw my next pickup spot,

Oh, and I should clarify that It was really early not even morning yet, in fact, its not an understatement to call it nighttime as I sat in my 2022 Toyota corolla

I turned on my favorite song, “butterfly effect” and bobbed my head as I neared the point for the pickup. It was at a casino, and the man that emerged from the neon laced door came and waved at me, I poked my hand out the window, and waved him inside, he stepped in the front seat, and without acknowledging me he began to rock back and forth saying to himself in the most distraught voice.

“oh no, oh NO…I lost all my money I saved all my last year savings and income just to hit my luck, and now I lost all of it just like that, what the heck will I do?”

He looked as if he was on the verge of hurting himself or worse. he was sweating profusely up till now he had not looked at memoir removed his covid mask. Yes it was that time.

But when I remember what I saw when he did I start itching and I get chills down my legs and back. 

His Teeth looked like brad nails, and his eyes were an off-white color with a red vein going through each eye, and he swiveled his eyes to look at me. I was so shocked I ran over a traffic stop and came to a hard stop.

I blinked and stared at the horror of a man that was standing before me.

“Sir?” I said.

“Im not a sir” he said tears now running down his black streaked face.

I am not a small guy by any means and I had been hitting jump for the past 5 years, but looking down at y arms now and I felt like I was made of felt.

“Get…out of my car” I said to him using the driver controls to unlock the doors

He looked at me and stepped out the car, it was then that I saw his mud caked hooves, they were not cloven…

He must have seen the look on my face, but he quickly unfolded his long pant legs over his “feet” and Ade his way into the misty city morning.

I took a second to breath and get my bearings and locked all the car doors. And drove to my next stope slowly contemplating just going home. 

“No” I thought, I couldn’t leave them.

“Some one is depending on Me to get them to there destination safe and quickly”

With this thought I drove to the next stope at the side of the road, there were two teenagers a guy and a girl, the guy waved and they got in. 

As we chatted about were they were going, and they told my what a bad choice of song I had playing, I considered telling them about the guy I saw earlier.

I didn’t.

The two teenagers left, I stopped and got some gas .

Being quite shaken and nearly questioning my sanity, I pulled over to a not yet opened coffee shop, I parked my car, and surfed reddit horror subs.

After about three minutes I restarted my car, and after checking my phones Uber app, I drove about 30 more minutes to a small apartment complex. When I parked my car my phone rang.

“Hello” it was the customer

“Oh hello, this is Ahmad from Uber I see you have a pickup scheduled, and I am at the apartment”

“Oh yes…Thank you I am coming down”

I saw the man come down the dirty, concrete apartment stairs. He had a blue hoodie, and sweat pants. he had on a white covid mask.

He walked up to my car as I unlocked the doors. My heart rate quickened, and I hovered my hand over the lock doors button.

When he opened the door, and got in, I couldn’t help but laugh at myself a bit. He looked at me.

I smiled at him. He lied through his mask, I could see his artificially high cheeks’, he had sunglasses.

“hi” I said

He looked at me he looked like he was smiling.

“hi” I said again trying to get a look at his face

I thought I saw the muddy-white eyes from before, it couldn’t be. This man was a completely different person.

I sat in my chair for a while until I snapped out of it, and looked for the car keys, they were sitting in the middle of the seats. We both looked at them. 

I reached slowly down and got them, while bent I felt someone swiftly rub my back soothingly. I cringed sitting back up quickly.

“What the hell was that for dude?” I said now angry

“I didn’t do anything to you” he said looking out of his window with the back of his head turned to me.

”I want to go to the gardening shop, to get some soil”

I was surprised at the randomness of his request, and just nodded wanting to get this over with, but no, I HAD TO FIND OUT.

I don’t know why I did this, but I guess it was just me trying to reassure myself that this man had nothing to do with the freaky man I saw earlier.

I began with a shaky voice, I tried to make I sound as if I was hiding a light laugh.

“earlier I…earlier I saw a freaky monster with white eyes with a whole lot of nails in his mouth…” I said it in a somewhat joking manner

“Have you seen anything like that?” I added

There was a long silent pause, as the man turned to me, the light of my now flickering dashboard lit up his eyes.

He nodded.

“I have” he said, “he visits everyone with a Toyota”

“Your kidding right?” I was just thinking to myself how stupid this whole thing Was when I saw him reach up to his white face mask.

“Can I take this off?” 

“Come on dude, its covid keep your mask on”

For a second he put down his hands. Then reached back up to his face. He did this with one arm, with the other he yanked the key from the ignition, and pressed the sharp key to my neck, I pressed up against the seat, and he pulled off his sunglasses and mask. 

“I don’t know if you will this or not,” he said 

He leaned in on my face, a smell like vanilla filling the car. His gums were like that of a shark, with bent nails lining his mouth, and his eyes, as Im writing this three days later I gag. His eyes were a muddy swirled white color. With no eyelashes, or brows. His eye had no purple or center, just a huge white abyss strung with red veins, that looked as if they would burst.

He closed his mouth, cutting his already messed-up chin, he had no lips. 

“Not to scare you mr Uber driver but, was it like this?”

It was.
