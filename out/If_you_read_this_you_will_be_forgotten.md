I'm awake now. And I need help. If you read any further, everything you ever have been will be put at risk, but please. I need to end this- and I can only do it with help.

For the past month? Year? I think I've been living a waking nightmare. Misery compounded, destroyed me, took everything that made me a person from me- and I didn't even realize what had been happening. 

I began to notice it at my old job, before I moved to the empty house filled with the shadows that give me migraines, before I escaped the apartment with the room that filled me with dread the moment I even so much as touched the door.

I'd started there two years ago. I was good at the job I had been assigned- but a few months ago I was suddenly shunted into a new department. Nobody would tell me why- nobody could even seem to explain it. I could only imagine it was due to the lack of a supervisor in our department- but I had done my job well without one so far.

I struggled. The room I was moved to was an open office floorplan, cubicles dotted around it. What was weird, however, was the shadows. It was the first time I'd noticed them- but thinking about it, I seemed to remember seeing something similar seeping from under the strange door in my aparment. I assumed it was mold, and complained to my department head- but I was met with derision, and a sense that he was panicked, afraid, at the end of his rope. My department had a massive workload to be completed, with no time, no documentation, seemingly having been left untouched for months.

My new supervisor was awful. I asked him to clean the shadows staining the floors and cubicle walls- they weren't quite shadows, but it felt like an apt way to describe them. Even now, I don't know what I'd say they were made of- they appeared to be ashy, but touching them made your finger come away with a slickness. They darkened any material they touched, cast a pall over it, but even when I tried to clean them *myself* I couldn't rub any part of them away. But yeah. Never got cleaned, and I got told to stop wasting time- we had more important matters to deal with.

I felt like my supervisor tried to blame me for everything, to shift any fault from him to keep his own job- and the office was so quiet. There was no one to turn to for support. Upper management constantly seemed to be at the end of it's rope, every department felt like it was on fire. We were severely understaffed, more work was piled on me day by day, and I felt sick. Constantly. The shadows were everywhere, I realized- not only in my office, not only in that room I couldn't bring myself to enter back at home, but strewn across the office. Looking at them made me violently sick, migraines would threaten to split my skull, and eventually I broke down. I couldn't live like this. So I'm ashamed to say I ran- I paid to break my lease, and I bought a home far, far away- and moved. I left.

Now. There are a few issues with my recollection of events. I've done the math on the cost of this home- which was last sold *two years ago*, according to research I've done online. I've checked my salary, my savings before starting that job. 

I couldn't afford it. Not the house, not the cars sitting in the driveway. And yet, about a month ago, I woke up in a home that didn't feel like *mine*. It felt like a dream- like I was struggling through a nightmare. When had I bought this place? How had I moved over, gotten it fully furnished. Why did I purchase a three bedroom home for one person?

But even through all that, I felt relieved. I had escaped those miserable people, I had a chance to start over- I owned a home, had some savings, and could start over.

I could start over, until I opened one of the empty rooms, and saw a shadow staining a desk, a computer, part of a chair- draped over it like a sleeping cat. The migraines started again. There were only a few here, but that was enough to send me spiraling.

I couldn't leave the house. I couldn't leave my room- the few times I did I noticed people staring. Everyone was so rude, so awful, and the shadows...

People talked about them. Not to me- they hated me, one another, but they still complained about them in loud whispers, on neighborhood watch forums and apps.The shadows dotted the neighborhood. They loathed speaking of them, but the way they described them... I realized what they reminded me of, a comparison I had avoided making until then.

When they were spread across the pale sidewalk, the contrast was clear. They were shaped like corpses. The arms were too long, the heads stretched, legs spindly. It was all wrong, but they looked, in one way or another, like bodies.

I felt like I was going insane. I was going insane. I asked for advice online, and got told it *must* be memory issues. I couldn't coherently explain everything, but I latched onto that explanation desperately. I felt empty- there were huge, gaping holes in my life. 

I couldn't even remember my childhood. All I remember was being alone from the very first moment I could think- but that couldn't be right.

I felt like I was on autopilot- like I was barely a person, but a thing. There were once things that had given my life meaning, but they'd never actually existed- inside they existed in the periphery of thought, to guide me along a predetermined pattern. The world had become flat- all I could do was find a routine to fall into, submit into the loveless cycle of work, and to feel the hatred and fear of everyone around me.

Hospitals wouldn't admit me- I don't know how many I visited, but the shadows were waiting- they locked me as receptionists screamed, threatened to call security. Doctors looked tired, overworked, sickly themselves- I wanted to ask if they had the migraines too, but I couldn't stay for long enough. I could tell, for some reason, the world had begun to go insane. Everyone was wretched to one another- but they hated me the most.

Hate wasn't the right word. They were afraid of me. There was something sick about me. Wrong.

And then the last resort. I went to see the police.

Shadows stared at me from the cells as they listened to me- stuck me in a room, accused me of everything they could. They didn't even believe I'd been born here- and honestly, I wasn't sure either. I'd never known my parents, never been raised by anyone- everything I'd learned I'd taught myself. Language. Reading.

How to dress myself, how to love, what it felt like to hold someone's hand, to trust someone, to feel shame when you let them down and pride when you did right by them.

They accepted that. One of them was ready to throw me away, ship me off, but one of them...

He hated me. I know this. But he looked at the shadows and he looked at me, and there was something he hated more, and that it was that none of this made sense.

Bit by bit, he picked me apart. His partner went through everything I owned, and he unwound me.

How had I purchased the home? Why did the old job fall apart? Why had I been transferred, what were these shadows, What was in that ROOM?

How could someone be raised in total isolation without being completely unmade? It was impossible. I had become an impossible thing.

They let me go. They want me to answer more questions, soon, but I don't need to.

Bit by bit, I think something has been unmaking my life. 

I can't have been born into this world alone. Something took this from me, took love and companionship and stripped it from the world, from history. And slowly, the world has shifted, and around me it becomes *lesser* for it.

There are photo albums that are empty now, but I look at the pages and see where the light burned the pages, and where it didn't. The imprint of memory still exists. 

Someone taught me how to tie my shoes. Someone taught me what a mother and father was.

Someone was waiting for me here- someone LIVED here before me.

Something ate it. Destroyed them, destroyed everything that showed me kindness, left only misery in its wake. I have birth certificates with the signatures faded away, but I can see I came from SOMEWHERE.

I want back my life. I want to give back what's been lost. And I know where it begins.

Back in that apartment.

Back in that room.

I dreaded opening the door because I knew what lay beyond it. I opened it once, and I saw something that loved me and that I had loved, but what it had done to itself was too horrible to accept, to understand, to remember- because to accept it would be to do it to myself. So I closed it off, shut it off, tried to forget.

It wants for it to be the only thing left, maybe. To be all the love that exists in the world. I don't know. Maybe it's not even something I loved, but something that needs me to love it, and it has rewritten things to make me come crawling back. I don't know- but it began there. So I have to try and fix this, don't I? I have to make my way back to it. I have to finish what I started, close the cycle I've begun.

Without care, compassion, the world will begin to move on autopilot, running itself through a cycle of just *living* without PURPOSE until it burns itself out.

I have to hurry. That cop will start looking for me soon- and if he starts to worry, if they start to care... Then it'll eat them too. And I'll never have met them, but perhaps some of their fellows will still chase me. And I'll have forgotten everything I've pieced together-  I'll be empty, and hollowed out, and the thing behind the door will have me and all it's eaten.

But it's ok now. Because we share a history now, don't we?

If you care even a little, that's enough. I think it takes *time* to make things lesser, digest them and their history to nothing but the nuclear shadows staining my life. So the more of you that read this, the better. The more time we will all have.

I'm sorry. But I did warn you. This will take time. I'm far from where I was, and already, my documentation has become degraded, ruined by this thing. My only advantage is that I'm becoming a ghost, bit by bit- so I'll slip through every crack I can to make my way home.

And if it finds its way to you? If the migraines grow worse, and you begin to feel yourself be eaten away, everything that's ever made you you become naught but a vicious dark? I'm sorry.

I'll try to remember you. 

I'll fix this. I promise.

Thanks
