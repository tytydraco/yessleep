I walk with steady steps, each step the same as the last. I had gone for a walk around my neighborhood in the moist cloudy morning.

“There's someone in your house…”

There it is, that voice again, that demon in my head. 

“Stop it.” I say quietly to myself. I walk onto my cul de sac and my house is at the end. I see something in the window, a shadow that retreats further into my house. The demon in my head was right. I walked to the garage and dug in my pockets to find the remote to open the garage door. I found the remote and clicked on the button, the garage door slid up slowly and onto the slot on the roof of the garage. Gabe’s car was in there. Damn Gabe. Gabe was one of my friends, well, he would like to think of himself as my friend. However I bloody hate Gabe! That bastard. One day he stole my spare garage remote, and now he lets himself in whenever i’m gone and steals my beers. When I consulted him about it, he shrugged it off like it was nothing.

When I consulted Gabe firmly, He just laughed. 

“Shout at him and kick him out of your house…” The demon says quietly and menacingly, its voice echoing in my brain. I stopped, maybe this demon was right. After all this time, I never had the courage to kick Gabe out, but maybe this demon was giving me the courage. You know what? That’s exactly what I'm gonna do. I walked into the garage and grabbed my hand axe and walked through the door into the living room.

”GGGGABE!!! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!” I shout and my angry voice echoes through the house. Gabe emerges through the drawers under the breakfast bar spilling out protein and creatine containers. Gabe looks at me, shocked and looks a little sad.

“What?” Gabe asks.

“You heard me, you fat bastard!” I shout and swing the axe, connecting with his shoulder. I hear a thud and a squelch and blood spurted out, splatting onto my face and I licked the metallic tasting blood. Gabe wails and pushes the axe away, the impact point bloody and dripping onto the floor. Gabe gets up shaky and looks at me terrified.

“You demon!” Gabe shouts and lets himself out through the back door. I felt the best I had ever  felt and I went to take a nap, for the first time, with a smile on my face. I woke up puzzled as to why I was bloody. As I lay there, I remember everything and I am completely horrified with myself. I listened to the demon… I went downstairs to where the most blood was. I step over it and go to the fridge to grab a beer. I open the fridge, and there is a cake that says happy birthday. It was my birthday and Gabe wanted to surprise me, and I paid him back by landing an axe in his shoulder. I am a terrible person. I go to the breakfast bar and there laid a birthday note that read:

“Happy Birthday Jeremy! Thank you for everything and for being such a good friend. I hope you have a good birthday and enjoy your 40th birthday. You only turn 40 once.

P.S sorry for stealing your remote, I needed it to get in when you were gone to surprise you!”

Tears well up behind my eyes. Gabe just wanted to surprise me for my birthday, he wasn’t a bad annoying person, I was. I sigh. I go back to bed and get on my phone, doom scrolling on YouTube and sending apologetic texts to Gabe. During my doom scrolling, I was interrupted with a notification. It was Angelica, one of my friends I had in high-school that I was still in contact with. She remembered my birthday and wanted to go on a walk with me to celebrate. The walk she wanted to do was a walk that descends down a cliff near the city, giving you a nice view of the ocean. There were also statues, she knew I liked statues or anything involving abstract art. I replied instantly, agreeing to the plan, and agreeing on a time. 4:00 Pm comes and I get ready for the walk, wearing the right clothes and gear. I take a train to the station in the city near the walk. There were 5 carriages and I was in the 5th. I had 14 stops and Angelica would be joining on the 10th stop. 

“The 5 carriage is going to explode…” The demon says quietly and sounds amused. 

“Shut up.” I say to the demon and an old lady looks at me, hurt.

“How rude!” The lady says.

“Not you, the demon in my head.” I replied.

“The demon in my head?-” She leans back and releases a cackle-”Are you on LSD dear? Or Marijuana?” She asks and then laughs again.

“Haha, that's almost funny.” I say calmly and go back to minding my own business thinking ”I am not going to listen to you, demon”. On the 10th stop I see Angelica enter onto the 3rd carriage. Her memorable black purse and her stylish clothes enter my view. I get up and walk to carriage 3, thinking “You won, demon.” I walk to her and she spots me and gives me a hug. We exchange “How are you” and “Long time no see” and “Happy birthday”. We get off at stop 14 and as the train disappears in the distance we begin to walk to the- BOOM!!! The train in the distance explodes, the 5th carriage. My ears ring and the ground shakes and rumbles.”Holy shit!” Angelica shouts. So with that, an hour delay was due. After the cops arrived we began to walk and she said something nostalgic about high school times. After that I explained everything to her, about how I think there's something wrong with me,something in my head, the demon in my head as we walk to the walk. 

She stops and looks at me.

“Haha, very funny. You gave up on art and now write horror stories?” She says mockingly.

“Kill her… Throw her off the cliff…” The demon in my head begs as Angelica goes on about how the exploding train would be a good horror story. I pause and consider this.

”No, not her, not Angelica.” I thought. I think harder and suddenly, I feel myself agreeing to this plan. You know what? What a good idea. I looked around to see if there were any witnesses. No one in sight. I turn back to Angelica who seems concerned. 

“Is everything all rig-” She started but I cut her off with my fists across her face. She stumbles back, impact point red and her expression clearly startled and hurt. She rummages in her purse and claws away with a can of pepper spray. Typical. She begins to empty the contents on my face but I look away and disarm her and the pepper can rolls away, clinking on the concrete. I picked her up by the waist and threw her off the cliff, over the guard rail. She showed little resistance and as she plummeted down she let out an ear piercing scream. I felt really good and proud of myself. I found myself smiling. Time to continue the walk. I walk with steady steps, each step the same as the last. I had gone for a walk in the moist afternoon. I went down a stair after stair after stair. I pass statues, abstract pieces of art with a scene fossilized in stone. I approach the end of the stairs onto the banks of the ocean. A statue caught my eye. A demon with horns sprouting from its head and eyes narrowed into slits but what caught me most was a block that fitted into a part of its forehead. I grabbed the block and tugged and it slid right out onto my hand. On 1 face of the block was an odd sigil engraved in the stone block. 

“You found it… The key… The key to me!” The demon in my head exclaims. The block suddenly jerked to the direction of the ocean, as if the block was caught in some sort of gravity from the ocean. A patch in the ocean lit up, just a small square patch, but it was enough to catch my eye. A sense of awe came over me and I rubbed my eyes. 

“This could be a fun adventure…” The demon in my head says.

“Yes…” I agree.

“Throw the block…” The demon in my head says. When the demon said that, I automatically raised my hand holding the block and took aim for the lit up patch because I knew I had to land it in the patch. I threw it and it landed on the patch with a splash. I expected something grand to happen. Something to let me know something happened, however, I got a whisper in my head.

“Come to me…” The demon whispered and my vision went black.

I woke up with a start. I looked around and realized I was in the ocean! Under the water where a gravity was pulling me down and fast! I suddenly realized I had an urge to breathe! I tried to paddle up but my arms wouldn’t move up and the surface wasn’t even visible. I felt scared, no not just scared… What's the word for it? Ahh… Terrified, I was terrified! I was also a little mystified, how was this happening? I endured 30 seconds of being pulled down and feeling terrified until I hit something solid. The impact caused me to buckle my knees. It felt like gravelly sand on my feet. The block was in front of me, the engraved sigil lit with a vibrant red. The red glowed in the dark, giving me enough light to see crabs scuttling away from where I was. A hand grabbed the block. I followed the hand to a body which was connected to legs and a head. It was the demon that was in my head, but here instead of my head. The head had horns sprouting from its head and eyes narrowed to slits, just like the statue. The eyes glowed red in the dark, greatly illuminating everything. The demon wasn’t detailed, no features except for that its skin had a quality like stone. The demon raised its claws, jagged points that could slice through my easily, and blew on it releasing a giant air bubble that covered both me and the demon. I gasped, letting all necessary oxygen into my lungs. I collapsed onto my knees and breathed in ragged breaths.

“Well… Hello there…” The demon said, with a calm and steady voice, a voice that no human should have, but this wasn’t a human, it was a demon, the demon inside my head.

“What is this? Where am I? WHO ARE YOU!!!” I shouted and realized I didn’t have oxygen for shouting and went into a fit of gasping.

“Woah… Calm down there… I am the demon in your head…”It says, mockingly.

“I know that! But, but, what are y-ARGH!-” I breath in a deep breath-” Okay, wait… Let me go please, and get out of my head. I’m good at making promises, I promise I'll never mess with forces like you again… Do-do we have a deal?” 

The demon seems to consider this.

“I see.” It says matter of factly.

“So do we?” I ask, trying to sound as innocently as possible. The demon looks at the block and to me, narrowing its eyes.

“No…” The demon says.

“No? You're going to kill me? You're going to keep possessing me?” I ask, exasperated.

“I’ll let you go. However, I will always be the demon inside your head and stay there. Also you need to retrieve a block, like the one I have here”- The demon raises its hand, showing the block-” but it's in your house somewhere. You should be able to feel the energy. Good luck, 

When you finish, go to your cul de sac and place the block on the manhole in the middle of the cul de sac and place the block there, there should be a section carved out to perfectly fit.”

The demon explains to me and my vision goes black. I am in my house in the garage. I feel a tug and I look back. Nothing. I remember the demon’s words. I should be able to feel the energy, this was the energy. I find the block, in a hidden hole in the wall. As I walk out of the garage, I pass my hand axe, dried blood on it. I pause, should I really let this demon force me to do its bidding? Should I let it possess me? No, the answer is no. I grab the hand axe and walk to the manhole. It is night and there are no witnesses. This type of night is the type that is so dark, where even streetlights barely illuminate the scene. I walk to the manhole and see the carved out part, I place the block in and its engraving illuminates. The carving goes dark and I grab the block and step back. The manhole flies off into the night and a hand emerges. A hand with the texture of stone. The demon emerges menacingly.

“Very good… You have done an incredible job…May I ask, where is the block?” The demon asks, reaching a hand out. I raise the block, revealing it to the demon.

“Ah… May I have it? The demon asks, patiently.

I look at him and then the block. I make direct eye contact with the demon and narrow my eyes.

“No…”I say.

“No?” The demon asks, surprised.

I reveal the hand axe which I had been keeping secret. I throw the block up and swing the axe.

It was timed properly and the block shattered into little fragments. 

“YOU DARE!” The demon shouts and I raise my axe and let out a war cry! A war cry to let this demon know that it can’t ruin my life without me ruining its life back. For Gabe and Angelica.

I will end this demon, the demon in my head…
