I awoke to my mom screaming at me from downstairs. 

“Hurry up, we will be late for mass, get a move on.“ 

I hated mass, I hated everything about it. I don't know what it is, but it creeps me out. 

Every night, we all had to dress in white, even down to our shoes. We had to look perfect. It was beyond weird but we all had to do it. 

My mom was never a churchgoer. Even my dad was never pushed about going to mass, but they seemed to be embracing it lately. 

It all started when we joined this new church.  The last church we were in was great; we only had to turn up on Christmas and Easter and Fr Hannon was the coolest priest around. He told me being Catholic didn’t mean going to church every Sunday; as long as we lived good lives, that was enough in the eyes of God. 

I was sitting down at the breakfast table eating toast when I turned to my mother. 

“Mom, why do we all have to wear white going to mass? I feel stupid.” I said as I glanced up at her, 

“It's because, in God's eyes, we are all pure, so when we visit God's house, we dress in a way that reflects that.” 

I glanced back at my toast, “You are right, Mom.”

As I was eating the last of my toast my father walked into the kitchen dressed in the same suit I was wearing. He looked at my mother 

“Are we all ready to get a move on, honey pumpkin” 

My mom shot my dad a loving smile 

“We sure are, Bumpkin.” 

You see, ever since we joined this new church things have gotten creepy around here.  I watched an old horror film once called Bodysnatchers with my dad. It felt like that film. It felt like my parents had been replaced by Aliens. 

After a painfully perfect, silent car journey, we finally got to the church. The church was new. It was grand, built to make a statement. The building itself was brilliant white, with a big glass roof. It had big stained glass towers on each corner of the building. It looked like a castle but ugly as hell. 

As we drove through the car park I spotted Mr. Stevens and his two sons, but there was no sign of his wife, which was strange because she was always by his side. 

As we walked over to them I pointed at the clothes the boys were wearing.

“Glad to see I am not the only idiot around here,” I said laughing at the two boys.

They just stood there not even flinching at the fact I just called them idiots. They stood there staring at me with expressionless faces. I went to school with them and they were always up for a laugh. It was like they were soulless replicas of who they used to be. 

Mr Stevens looked troubled. He was angry but with a sadness in his eyes. My mom put her hand on his shoulder. 

“I'm surprised to see Suzanne isn't with you?” asked my mother. 

Mr. Stevens lowered his head in shame.  

“She didn't take to the bread,” said Mr. Stevens.

"Did I just hear that correctly? Bread! What.“ 

My mother looked at him. “Not everyone takes to the bread, she wasn’t pure like us. 

My father and Mr Stevens just looked at each other and nodded in agreement as we all turned and packed into the church like mindless sheep. 

Soon as you walked into the hall you were hit by a wall of white. The white marble pews blended into the white marble floors, leading up to a big, white Altar. 

We all sat there in perfect silence as we waited for the priest to make his way out. The door behind the Altar opened and out walked Fr. Kane.

Fr. Kane made his way to the Altar. A lanky, hunched-back, creepy-looking man who seemed to glide across the floor. 

Fr. Kane took a big silver tray from below the Altar, that had a big chalice of bread sitting on it. 

With both hands, he raised the bread over his head. 

“This bread is the body of God. He is the purest embodiment of man. Only the pure shall feast upon his flesh. 

I looked around to see arms stretched in the air, basking in their creepy perfection. 

It was coming to the part when the bread was to be given out, and one thing I knew for sure: I was not eating the bread!

While my parents went and did some grown-up stuff. I was stuck with a bunch of kids from the church. My plans didn't involve being brainwashed, so I decided to skip class and have a nose around the church. 

I walked back into the church. As I walked up towards the Altar I noticed the door where the priest walked out was slightly opened and peeked my head inside.

Unlike the front of the church, the walls appeared dirty. Red lights lined the corridor, giving off a creepy red glow. I should have turned back, but my curiosity was overriding my fear. 

At the end of the corridor, there was a door lined with brown leather. I turned the handle and stepped carefully over the threshold to a winding staircase leading down into a dark abyss. 

When I got to the bottom of the staircase. I heard voices emanating from the dark.  I walked nervously towards the voices where I found myself in a large cavern lit up by hundreds of candles. There were people in white robes and wearing masks, all gathered around an Altar. 

As I got closer I saw someone lying on the Altar. They seemed distressed, pleading for help. As I got closer I realized It was Mrs.Stevens. 

One of the strange-looking people stepped up to the Altar, producing a long, jagged blade. As they stepped up they took down their hood and took the mask off their face. I felt the blood drain from my body as my mother stood over Mrs Stevens, who was once her friend, with a large blade in her hand. 

As I stood there, I watched my mother raise her hands above her head before plunging the knife into Mrs Stevens's throat. With my heart racing, I turned and ran. I kept running until I was clear of the church. 

I decided to go to the only person that could help me, Fr. Hannon. I broke through the church doors crying out for the priest. As he ran over to me I blurted out everything. I told him about the bread, my parents, and all the other strange things that were happening at the other church. 

We got in his car and drove back to the church. I showed him where Fr Kane’s office was, and he told me to wait while he went and had a word with them. 

 As Fr Kane’s office door opened, I saw my parents in the office with Fr. Kane. 

I tried to listen through the door but all I could hear was mumbling. Finally, after what seemed like ages, the door opened and out walked Fr. Hannon.

“Well, did you talk to them? What did they say?”   I asked. 

Fr Hannon looked at me as if he was annoyed with me. 

“You need to stop making up stories; you need to stop being a brat and do what your parents tell you to do,”  then he walked off, leaving me in the clutches of my parents. 

When we got home the first thing I did was run to my room. I must have dozed off because when I woke up my mother and father were standing over me. 

“What's wrong?” I asked. 

My mother raised her hand and opened her palm. 

“You have been a naughty boy, you haven't been eating the bread,” she screamed. 

My father looked at me 

“There is no room for impurity. The impure get cleansed,”  he said in a hollow tone. 

I sat there in the bed shaking with fear.

“Get dressed, we are taking you to see Fr Kane.” 

We got to the church and the thoughts of becoming a mindless freak were too much to bear. My father dragged me to Fr Kane's office, where he was already waiting for me. 

He glided over behind his desk. There were no other seats so I had to stand before him. He pulled out a chalice of bread and looked at me.

“You have two choices: eat the bread or we will have your mother cleanse you.”

After seeing what happened to Mrs Stevens I knew what that meant. 

He took out a piece of bread. He made me reach over to grab it. As I went to grab the bread, I knocked over the chalice.  As the priest frantically tried to gather the bread. I saw my chance and ran. 

I broke out through the doors of the church and ran for my life down the road. As I was running, I spotted Fr. Hannon's car. He nearly hit me as I tried to get his attention, but managed to stop in time. 

I jumped into the front seat of his car and broke down crying. As we drove, he locked all the doors in the car with a flick of a switch. 

“Nobody is going to care. Why would they? Everyone takes the bread eventually. Trust me, once you are pure everything will make sense.,” he said as he drove in the direction of the church. 

My heart was racing as he drove up to the church, doors where my parents were waiting with Mr Stevens and his two sons. 

As I jumped out of the car one of Mr Steven’s sons looked at me. 

“It's so much better this way.”

 It was either eat the bread or die, so I had no choice. I walked into the church and the doors behind me closed.

"Everything is perfect now. I'm Pure. My actions are pure because now they are God's actions. 

As I walked into the church with my perfect parents, pure in the thought, I looked down and saw that my perfect shoes were untied. 

As I bent down to tie them Mr. Stevens' two sons walked past me. As they passed they both gave me a nod of approval. 

I looked up at them and gave them a big, beaming smile!... I raised my hand and gave them the middle finger and their Jaws hit the floor in disbelief. 

My mother was right about one thing. 

Not everyone takes to the Bread!
