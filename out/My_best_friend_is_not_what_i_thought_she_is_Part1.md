So, I F(24) have a bestfriend F(26). We have been inseparable since the day we got to know each other , that is 2 years ago. We moved in together just a month after meeting each other. Since then we have been sharing an apartment. She knows my family and have seen them all. My mom especially loves her as her own daughter. My siblings love her and even my dad who's not an easy to get along person likes her alot. But i have never known her family never seen them. When i asked about her family for the first time , she got very tense and visibly uncomfortable , i realised she doesnt like to talk about her family. She told me she ran away from home when she was 16 because they were abusive. I never brought it all up ever again. So one day i met a very nice guy at a party and we got along very easily. i loved the way he spoke , his behaviour and especially the way he looked. He was extremely hot and good looking. I knew at that time that i might end up dating this guy for a long time or even get married to him who knows. I eventually introduced Liam to my bestfriend Lynn. But despite him being an awesome person, she didnt seem to like him. i talked to her about him but she just told me that that there's nothing like that, she likes him. Weeks passed and Liam and i were falling in love with each other. I couldnt help but notice that Lynn was behaving oddly, ignoring Liam , staring daggers at him sometimes and even one time she told me that She thinks she saw Liam at a club with a girl but she wasnt sure about it , if it infact was Liam or some other guy since he was leaving when she saw him That created alot of tension between me and Liam but i eventually let it go, assuming that abviously cannot be Liam since he was out of town that week when Lynn claimed to have seen him. One night Lynn and i were going out to a party when i noticed her grinning at me from my peripheral vision. When we got to the party i shorty recieved a call from Liams best friend telling me he got into an accident and was at the hospital. Eventually he recovered and i was thankful that i didnt lose him. When we heard that he was stable, Lynn didnt seem happy to hear that, she looked angry somehow instead of looking glad to hear that Liam was stable. Life went on and we were so happy. Liam was deciding to propose to me soon. I was excited. But then one unfortunate night, Liam's bestfriend and room mate called me to ask if Liam was staying at mine for tonight, but he wasnt. We were confused since he wasnt picking calls either. We decided to wait till the morning but he didnt show up 2 days passed and we filed a missing person's report. We tried everything we could be nothing helped. Nobody was able to find him. After 2 months of him going missing , i recieved a phone call at 4 am in the morning. On the other side was a frantic guy whispering , i couldnt understand what he was saying but then i heard him saying , "ITS ME LIAM!! I'M ALIVE, I'M ALIVE, It's.... and then the phone call disconnected and i was left sweating, teary eyed in the middle of the night.
