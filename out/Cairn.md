(Pt. 2)

I thought that it was my mind playing tricks on me at first. I have had it happen before when I was alone on hikes. Natural human paranoia of thinking you hear something in the woods. The standard call of the wild, fear of the unknown. I was making similar time to Allison when I reached the first major outcropping. This mountain was by no means a pure vertical climb, it was steep but still walkable, more wide than it is tall. After a day or so of hiking alongside it I began to climb more. The weather had been abysmal: pouring rain and cold. I had felt the cold work its way through my soaked clothes and start to chill my core. It was at that point that I stopped and took a moment to recollect myself. After setting up for the evening I read more of the journal hoping to figure out if I was still on the right track. 

10/9/10 1:50 p.m.: I think that it’s all in my head. I had been paranoid that I was being followed. Now a few days have passed and I haven’t heard anything. I tried to call my mom today but I have no signal this high up. I’m still on track to hit the West River checkpoint, I know that they have a satellite phone there. The rain has stopped now and I feel more at ease. I’ve been thinking about everything that happened between Josh and I. I think I should call him when I get back and finally be done with it all. 

10/9/10 5:45 p.m.: I decided to set up camp early as I made pretty good time today. I think if I really push tomorrow I will get to the other side by around 7. Other than that I found a spot of the cliff that looks layered. I took a picture of it with my camera so I can show mom and Sarah. 

10/9/10 8:07 p.m.: I ran into another hiker! His name is David and he’s hiking the west branch too. He seems pretty cool and he set up camp near me (don’t worry I have my bear mace ready if he tries anything). I think that we’re going to make the push together tomorrow, which is fine by me! He seems to be experienced and said he knows a few scenic areas we can stop. 

David. I didn’t remember reading about him in any of the investigation notes. Then again I wasn’t sure if he even knew she’d gone missing. When I got down to the check-in I figured I’d be able to backlog the check-ins and look for a last name. He might have more information about Allison. I stood from my fire then and creeped around looking for the rock formation she had written about. I abandoned my search after an hour of walking in the downpour. By the time the sun set the rain still hadn’t let up and I decided to just call it, earlier than I would have liked. I changed out of my wet clothes and hung them in the corner to dry. The night dragged on with the sound of rain and wind hitting my tent. 

I heard it for the first time that night. Around three in the morning the cry first rang out. It was quiet and sounded like it had come from miles away. I was sure it was a mountain lion at first. The scream sounded like it was underwater or shouted through fabric. Muffled and quiet but still high enough that it cut through the rain. I felt the color drain from my face and I lay quiet, afraid to move. If it was a mountain lion or something else I didn’t want to draw more attention to myself. I closed my eyes tight and sunk further into my sleeping bag praying it was just my imagination. It cried out again closer this time, a few yards away at most. It sounded again, closer. My imagination created a picture, someone standing on the edge of the camp. Eyes replaced with empty holes, head smashed in and putrid skin sliding off bleached bones. I didn’t dare move, and it didn’t cry out again. The rest of that night is still a blur to me. I just know I didn’t get any sleep. 

The next morning it felt like I was moving in slow motion. The fatigue overwhelmed me but I knew I had to keep going. Camp was slowly cleaned up and the tent put away. My legs shook as I began trudging down the muddy path. When I crossed the threshold of where my camp had been I noticed something. Footprints. Not boot or shoe marks but barefoot prints. They circled around my camp five times in total, with each loop getting closer. I felt a lump in my throat as I stared at them mimicking their movement as I followed. The footprints themselves were close together, each lying just in front of the other. The toe perfectly lined up with the heel of the next step. This level of precision would have taken them at least a few hours. I moved quicker after that. All of my hair was standing on end as I hiked further off trail. The entire time I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.
 
I hiked through the day as the heat and stagnant air dried the earth. This mixed with the higher elevation was beginning to take a toll on my sleep deprived body. When I finally paused to rest I heard the sound again. Step step silence. It had been following me. It had been following me for god knows how long and I just caught it. The slope was barren except for a few large bushes and grasses. Large chunks of rock jutted out across the landscape as I strained to see anything. The silence seemed to close in around me and my eyes darted around like a madman. I was completely and utterly alone. The feeling of dread that rose in my chest was something I’d never experienced before or since. Whatever was out there following me knew that I was aware of its presence and it was toying with me.
