Pt. 3 

The next day or so I spent in complete dread. The footprints had stirred some primal fear inside of my chest that I couldn’t shake. I tried to find something in Allison’s diary. She went missing on the eleventh of October. So all I had to do was find that page, find her and get the fuck out of there. I know it must sound insane but I needed to find her. The logical thing to do was to just leave but I NEEDED to find her. The pull in the back of my mind was enough to outweigh the dread and logic telling me to flee. So I pushed on and I read her entry. 

10/11/10 8:33 a.m. 
I followed David to the rock. It was pure black and glassy like obsidian. I’ve never seen anything like that before. We sat in silence for what seemed like only a moment but hours had passed. I told him that we needed to go, but he just sat there. After that I started to walk off but I couldn’t find my way. Everytime I walk away from it I just end up back there. I walked in a straight line south. Dead south. Back down the damn side of the ridge. There is no way I got turned around there is no way that I was confused but…as soon as I cleared the ridge I stood there again. My head is full of noise and my vision has gotten blurry. I am sitting by David and begging him to move but he won’t. I can’t go alone. I can’t go at all. I don’t know what to do. 

10/11/10 
It was there with us. I saw it from the corner of my eye. David said that’s where it liked to stay. I don’t know what it wants. 

10/11/10 7:50 a.m. 
David and I went to the ridge. The view over the lake was stunning. We’re going to make the final push toward the bottom and we should get there by around 1 or so. David said that there is a cabin we can rest at not too far from there which will be a relief. 

I stared down at the page. I felt my heart pounding in my ears and a look of confusion was spread across my face. What stone was she talking about? Why did she backdate an entry? Why could she not get off the mountain? By this point I had had enough. I was determined to find that cabin and avoid the path she took. I set up camp that night, my hands shaking. The nerves had finally gotten the best of me. As the sun set over the ridge the glow of the fire was quickly the only source of light. After a few minutes of sitting I decided to go in for the night, then I noticed them. Two beads of blackness that caught the glow. 

“Hello?” I called into the void. 

“Hello.” It called back. The man stepped into the light. He was tall, taller than me and had a bearded face. Something about his face was off putting, the way the skin sat on his bones looked too tight. He wore a pair of hiking boots, a green backpack and a smile on his face. He must have noticed the way my shoulders tensed and eyes widened. “Sorry if I scared you friend.” His voice was raspy but strong and he stepped closer to me. I instinctively backed away, moving onto my feet. 

“Who are you?” I tried and failed to strike the fear from my voice. He smiled and stretched. 

“I’m David.” As soon as the name left his lips I could hear my heart in my ears. The pounding only grew as David sat in camp. I tried to maintain what little composure I had left and made small talk with him. David was here to hike the west branch trail. He was from Oklohoma originally but moved to Idoaho to see more of the land. He had never hiked here before and…and he knew of a very interesting rock that a buddy of his had shown him. I nodded and smiled like each word didn’t cause my heart to nearly stop. He asked if I wanted to see it and I agreed. When we finally went in for the night it was around eleven. I laid in my tent and took out my hunting knife pretending to sleep. It was quiet for around an hour and I felt my eyelids droop. At some point I nodded off to sleep. 

Then I heard the scream again, closer. I startled awake and looked around to try and figure out what I’d heard. My tent was still zipped shut and I laid still watching it. A silhouette appeared then, slinking its way closer to the opening. It was a human figure barely visible in the low light cast by the moon. It walked towards my tent then turned sharply to the left. Step…step…step…I felt like I was going to throw up. 
The steps continued for hours well into the early morning. By the time I got the nerve to stand and open the tent the walking had ceased. There were no footprints in the dust around the tent and David was nowhere to be seen. Another hour passed before his tent unzipped. 

“You ready?” I nodded and packed up my bag. We left and hiked further down the mountain. Dread filled each step that we took. When we finally reached the spot David told me to wait, that it was just a bit further ahead. I nodded along before letting him walk further and further. Then I took off down the path away from David and wherever he was taking me. I ran and ran until I was completely out of breath and heaving. I looked around trying to see where I’d ended up when I saw it. A small grayish brown cabin, the windows broken and door sitting ajar. I knew from the sinking feeling in my stomach that I’d found it. The cabin that Allison’s diary was found in. The last place she was alive. I threw myself inside. The air was stagnant and reeked of dust. I began to tear the place apart in desperation looking for something, anything. 

But there was nothing. No note. No hint of life or of something passing through. No Allison. 

I ran from the cabin. I wasn’t sure where I was going but my legs carried me further and further. Despite the fact that it had just been morning I could see the sun cresting over the horizon. My heart drummed in my chest, my head was spinning. It took all of thirty or so minutes before I realized I had been going in circles. I was back at the cabin again and again. The further I ran the quicker I seemed to get back. I couldn’t figure it out and eventually I just broke down and my emotions took over. Despair filled my chest. Then I heard David call out. Despite my better judgment I ran towards his voice. My own cried out for him. He seemed to stay just far enough from me that I couldn’t see him. My feet screamed to a halt as I reached the face of the mountain. David was still calling out to me but I couldn’t place where he was.

Then I saw it. A small cave. He was in there. I knew he was. I pushed my way inside an animalistic drive in my chest. Pushing past spider webs and kicking rocks. I got about ten feet in when I smelled it. A stale, putrid smell. It filled the small space. 

“Josh? Where are you?” 

“David?” I called fumbling for my flashlight. It clicked on and I shone the beam around the small space. I froze when the light caught a green backpack. It was laying on its side, contents spread across the stone floor. A water bottle sat near my foot and I slowly crept the light further up. There was David. Wearing the clothes I had seen him in just yesterday. But they were stained brown and black. He looked ahead at me. His eyes were gone, replaced with hollow sockets. The skin on his face was slipping off and the little that remained on was dried and pulled taught. His leg was pinned behind him, trapped in what looked to be a crevice. His arm was extended out towards the bottle and scratches were carved into the dirt. I let out a scream. I had never heard myself make that noise before or since. I just stood there unable to look away. Unable to breathe as screams flooded the small room. I wish I could tell you what happened after but I don’t remember. What I do know is I came back to myself in that cabin. My shirt drenched in sweat and my knuckles bruised
