You’re not going to believe me. And that’s okay. You’ll say, “This is just another creepy story,” and you’ll click away to another thread, because no one comes to r/nosleep to actually sleep. You come here to feel something, because scrolling Instagram just isn’t cutting it anymore. And that’s fine. You’re the audience. I’m just the storyteller. But I’m not here to scare you—I’m here to make you *uncomfortable.*

I got a roommate last month. She showed up on a Tuesday—normal-looking girl, late twenties, dark hair, glasses that said “I read books” but not *which* books. Said her name was Lydia. Said she found the ad on Craigslist. I never posted an ad. I told her that, too, but she just smiled and set her suitcase down in the hall like it didn’t matter. “It’s fine,” she said. “It’s already done.”

That should’ve been my first clue. But no, I just shrugged and let her stay, because that’s what people like me do—we avoid conflict. We assume the world is logical, that things only happen when they’re supposed to, and when they don’t, we ignore the discomfort until it goes away or kills us. Spoiler: It didn’t go away.

She was quiet at first. Polite. Almost too polite. She cleaned the kitchen, washed the dishes, even organized my bookshelves alphabetically. Who does that? No one normal. But I let it slide because it was convenient. Because I didn’t want to ask questions. Because we don’t ask questions until it’s too late.

A week later, I found her standing in the living room, staring at the wall. Not at the TV or a painting—just the wall. Her head tilted slightly, like she was trying to hear something. I asked her if she was okay, and she turned to me with this blank expression, like she’d forgotten who I was. Then she smiled—too wide, like a mask stretched over her face—and said, “You should go to bed.”

That’s when I started locking my door at night.

The weird thing is, I don’t remember ever sleeping after that. I’d lie down, close my eyes, and then…nothing. No dreams, no rest, just this endless stretch of blank time, like a black hole swallowing the night. And every morning, I’d wake up feeling worse. Heavy. Drained. Like something was siphoning my life while I lay there, defenseless.

I tried asking her about it once. About the staring, the blank nights, the feeling that something wasn’t right. She just laughed. Not a normal laugh, either—too sharp, too precise, like she’d practiced it in front of a mirror. “You’re imagining things,” she said. “You’ve always been like this.”

How the hell would she know what I’ve always been like?

But here’s the part where you stop believing me. Because you’ll say this is just a story, that I’m being dramatic. But tell me this: when was the last time you really slept? Not just passed out, not just escaped into the safety of unconsciousness—but really, *truly* slept? When was the last time you woke up and didn’t feel like something had stolen a piece of you in the night?

I checked her room yesterday. She wasn’t there. The bed was made, the suitcase was gone, and the closet was empty except for a single piece of paper taped to the wall. It had my handwriting on it. Four words, scrawled like a child learning to write:

**I LET HER IN.**

And that’s the problem, isn’t it? We always let them in. The bad thoughts, the toxic people, the whispers that tell us we’re not enough. We think we can control it, that we’re too smart, too self-aware to fall for the trap, but we’re wrong. We always let them in, and we never notice until it’s too late.

So maybe this isn’t a ghost story. Maybe it’s not even real. Maybe it’s just me, staring at my own reflection, realizing that I’ve been my own worst roommate all along.
