dear diary,

 

I saw a boy die today. He did not deserve it. What was his fault? abiding by the rules? riding a bicycle? or that he did not see the car coming. The little sh*t deserved it. I bought chocolate for him since I see him every day. but it doesn't matter. An official's vehicle killed it. His blood and guts will be cleaned up by now, and his parents will have been given some money. His death is just a blip.

 

The high-speed car crashed into him. The boy went flying up in the air and landed neck first. The crack of the neck was somewhat satisfying to hear, and the blood oozing through his punched skin was even better. He suffered his fair share. He wanted to say something like 'fuck you' to the driver. His yellow t-shirt was covered in blood. Another good piece of waste, according to me. I was able to see his stomach, and kinda liked it. I have always liked human anatomy, but I was way too stupid to go to medical school. Finally, he gagged, choked on his own blood, and was gone. Seeing his dead eyes reminded me of them.

 

I could have saved him.

But why do I care? I got free chocolate.

 

I shouldn't have chosen journalism. Speaking against the system, what the fuck was I thinking? This might be my last entry because they noticed me and are coming after me, and I can't do anything about it. We all know the drill. They will run through my digital footprints and find something that is good enough for them to persecute me for treason. If they cannot find anything good enough, they'll declare me mentally unstable and send me to a mental correction institute." It's a goddamn brainwashing center. Dr. Schwartz, Samuel Goodman, and other people who went there came out as politically correct, soft-spoken sons of bitches. I would rather die. I don't want that future. I need my thinking. I need my freedom.

 

A revolution will come, and this place will burn, and in the fire, new leaders will emerge, but I won't probably live for that long. They are fucking with the minds of the young generation. teaching them the wrong history. mixing chemicals in the water,the food, and the air. I can feel the chemicals running through my body and making me ill. All of us are ill. As long as it favors them,they will kill anybody, cause any war, and make a profit.

 

I will probably have to burn this.

 

I will probably have teriyaki in my backyard for dinner.

 

Nobody is safe.

A revolution will come.

A revolution will come.
A revolution will come; they are coming.
A revolution will come.
A revolution will come.

 

I want to live. I can't die. The boy shouldn't have died. Everything is fucked. Why was I born? I can feel them spying on me. Am I real? Is this all real? Are you real?
