We went up to our hotel room afterwards and packed up just as dinner started. We ate a little at the hotel, but after the continued looks we got, we went to David early. He pulled up the limo right away and our luggage was packed in. Grant wasn't there, as he had apparently gone ahead of us to ready the house. 

That was fine by me. May was relieved too. 

Carol was worried about me, I could tell. She was supporting me as much as she could, but she needed answers. Deserved them. I wish that I could have mustered the courage to give them to her earlier. I could only imagine what I would do were the positions switched. Oh? You're having nightmares that leak into reality? Seeing weird stuff? Don't worry honey, I'm just going to call some nice men in white coats. They'll take care of you. Yeah right. Still, I had to tell her something, and soon.  

My mother's mansion is on the outskirts of the city in some woods. It used to be very far from everything, but now it was just a bit of a drive. While May was distracted with her Nintendo Switch on the other side of the limo, Carol leaned close.  

“Are you okay? You looked like you weren't quite with us at the hotel.” Carol whispered.  

“I've been trying to figure that out myself.” I said. This was her kind way of trying to broach the subject. Okay. I'll tell her.

“Are you okay right now?” Carol said. I smiled. 

“Yeah, I think so. It's just stressful. Do you remember that dream May told us about? The one with the man in red? The one we had on the plane too, and the one I had before that even,” I said. Carol nodded. “Well, you're going to think I'm crazy.” 

“What do you mean? You're already crazy.” Carol said. I gave her a gentle shove. 

“Okay. I'll try my best to tell you. Here goes. Remember how my nightmare is always of that same hallway? That hallway is actually a place in my mother's house.” 

“Megan– I'm sorry. We don't have to go back to your mother's house yet if it's hard for you to be there.” Carol said. 

“It's okay. We should go back. Face your fears and all that right? Anyway, something I didn't say about my dream on the plane is that it changed that time. Instead of ending when I reached the black door, the black door opened. There was a horrible monster inside. It played that song from the clock on a music box.” 

“I'm so sorry. You've been through a lot.” Carol said.  

“It's okay. Remember when you asked about that guy in a suit? I've been seeing that figure on and off, catching him out of the corner of my eye everywhere. It's always someone dressed in red. So when I went to see mother last night, there was this man just like May talked about. Red suit, pale. He was standing at my mother's bedside. That's why I was so upset when she asked about a man in red. I thought it was– it had to have been a hallucination or something, but after May saw him too? What does it mean?”

“Is this where the hotel came in?” Carol asked.

“Yeah. I talked to the front desk, and everyone just disappeared suddenly. The hotel hallway turned into my nightmare hall. This red suit man told me to free the monster in the door, and it would leave us alone. Both times, the plane and the hotel, I think it was May that saved me somehow.”

I shrunk into myself, waiting for Carol to call me insane, demand David turn around and bring us to the hospital. Carol watched me for a moment before speaking.

“Okay, that all does sound a little crazy– but just a little, and… I believe you. You wouldn't lie.” She said. 

“Carol, I'm starting to get scared.” 

Carol seemed at a loss. I could always come to her with a problem. She could always see it with a level head, but now she seemed unsure. 

“Well, I'm just glad you're okay,” She said. “We'll figure out this monster thing together. All right?” 

“All right.” 

“Something tells me that you're feeling done talking about it. Let's just focus on getting settled in.” 

We sat back and enjoyed the ride as much as we could. Carol even had another glass of wine. I took one too. 


We eventually rode in silence. The drive was long, took us later into the evening. Carol had apparently worn herself out and was napping. We all had a long day. My glass of wine from earlier had just turned into a headache.

I was watching the light of the last streetlamps roll through the interior when May scooted over to me. I felt her tug on my sleeve as she clicked in her new seatbelt. I was jolted from my half daze.  

“Megan?” 

“Hey, yeah? What's up, sis?” 

She was cradling her robot nervously. It took her a moment to gain the courage to speak. 

“I didn't say everything back at the hotel. What do I do if I keep hearing the music? It's like the song the clock makes at home.”

“Music?” I asked as my heart sank.

“Yeah, that one song.” She hummed it.  

“Right,” I interrupted. “That one. When are you hearing it?” 

“Whenever the suited man is near. Sometimes when Grant is near. There's something different about him.”

“I've noticed too. Maybe I should talk to David about it.” 

“You've been seeing the suited man too, right Megan?” 

“Yeah, May. I have. I don't really know what's going on here, but I think you saved me from him at the hotel. Thank you.” 

“Of course, I'll always save you,” May said. “But Megan, what do we do?” 
I pulled the card from my pocket. Myles West, it read with the phone number below.  

“What's that?” May asked. 

“Someone who can help us with the suited man,” *I hope.* “I just have to call them.”  

I stared at the card for a moment then put it away. I rubbed my eyes. I was so tired. 

“I'll call them when we get to mom's.” I said. 

“It's probably for the best. We're all too tired.” May said. 

“You've got that right, sis. How was the pool?”

She smiled. 

“So much fun. Thank you for letting us go.”

“You're welcome, May.”


 It only took a while longer for my mom's property to finally come into view. May eventually fell asleep against my shoulder. I couldn't sleep despite my tiredness. I just watched the trees as they passed, then my mother's house came into view.  

It was a mansion in every traditional sense. Like everything else my mother liked, it was accented in gold, and straight out of Victorian times. *‘It goes back to our English roots’*, she always said. The house had one central tower that all of the other towers formed around. The central tower had a window of tinted glass depicting a flowery scene of nature. It had a large porch and brick canopy that hung over the driveway. 

If I remember right, it was *seventeen thousand* square feet or something crazy like that. Three floors and a basement added later, fifteen rooms and an excess of gaudy interior design. The front yard was at least two acres of carefully kept gardens. The backyard was essentially an outdoor ballroom. Fountains, flowers, brick roads, and even a little church that was probably used for Christian practices back in the day. 
David rolled down the dividing window. 

“Everyone still asleep back there?” He said. 

“Just two out of three.” 

I saw his smile in the rearview. 

“Grant called ahead and said that the bedrooms are ready for you. Will you be taking your mother's room? Grant suggested it.”

I shivered at the thought. There was an odd sort of feeling telling me not to. I wasn't quite sure why I had that reaction, but I listened. 

“No, I think one of the others will be fine. Maybe the one across from my old room? Then May can have that one.” 

David nodded. 

The limo coasted along the driveway until we made it to the front of the house. The building loomed over us, the towers’ windows acting as judging eyes. 

I woke everyone up. Three other employees of my mother came from inside to take our luggage, directed by Grant. I sent May and Carol inside to follow Grant to their rooms. David handed me another master key for the house. I made the decision right there. I wanted to tell him. 

“David, can I talk to you for a second?” I asked. 

“Of course, Megan. Is everything all right?” We paused as Grant passed us with May and Carol. 

“That, right there. Something is different with Grant. You've seen it too, right?” 

David looked uncomfortable and nodded. 

“It started about a week before you flew out here,” He said. “Odd hours, odd manners and so on. I thought nothing of it until recently. He even talks differently somehow.” 

“Do you remember when you came by this morning to get me from the hotel? When my mother wanted to see me? Was I acting odd?” 

David thought for a moment. 

“You greeted Grant when I entered even though he wasn't there. I thought that it was a joke.” He said. My stomach knotted up at that. 

“I really did see him there, David. May saw something too. She said something like a ‘shadow over Davie's shoulder’.” 

He didn't seem too surprised. 

“There have been odd circumstances around your mother's illness. Megan, do you know what's going on here?” David said.

“There is something odd going on, David.” I gave him a brief rundown of what had been happening. He looked more and more perturbed at my descriptions.

“Okay. I believe you,” 

That was a bit of a relief. I had always been able to trust David. He continued. 

“Do you think that Grant has something to do with all of this then? He's worked for your mother for so long, I don't see why he would do anything adverse.” 

“Right, I agree. Can you just help me keep an eye on him? Until we know for sure?”

“Of course, Megan. I'm sorry that all of this has been happening to you. If something strange might happen here at the house, should we dismiss all but Grant and I?” 

“Yeah. Have them take a paid vacation.” I said. 

“I'll see to it. I hope you sleep well.” 

“Thanks. You too.”

The two of us walked inside. 

I was greeted by the grand entryway. A center staircase led up to the second and third floor. A dangerously large chandelier hung on the ceiling far above us, held by an old fashioned pulley on the wall. Not much had changed here in five years. There was a great portrait too, hanging on the first landing. I think it was my triple great grandparents and their children. All of their painted faces had heavy scowls.

I was uncomfortable here. I went off to bed right away, trying not to think about where I was. I walked up the stairs, past countless decorations, paintings, and potted plants in seasonal perfection. I thought of the hallway on the third floor. The hallway that was the center of my recent nightmares. It was only one floor up. Maybe if I saw that it was just a hallway, the door at the end just some storage closet, I'd be able to exist here. 

*Not tonight though. Confronting my demons is a tomorrow thing.* I thought.   

The rooms were just like I remembered them. The one Carol and I would be in, despite being one of the ‘smaller’ rooms, was bigger than some of the studio apartments I'd stayed in. Every inch of furniture and wall was inlaid with filigree. 

Our luggage had been packed into the rooms. Carol was unpacking inside, and looked up as I entered. 

“Hey, Megan.” 

“Hey.”

“How long do you think we'll have to stay here? I'm not sure if I have enough clothes for more than a few days.” Carol said. 

“I don't think that I can entertain my mom for too long. If something comes up before then, you and May can just go back alone. I can do some of my work on my laptop here.” 

“They don't have internet here though, right?”  

“Well, I have my phone hotspot. It should be able to handle it.” I said. 
“Sounds good. We'll figure it out,” Carol jumped onto the mattress. “Ooh, this is cozy. It's like quicksand in this thing.” 

“I wouldn't be surprised if they're all brand new.” I said. 

Carol reached over the edge and pulled out a remote. 

“No way, look, it's one of these adjustable things. Even has that binaural vibration or whatever.” 

I heard a low hum as it turned on and Carol closed her eyes. I shook my head, got into pajamas, and laid next to her. 

Despite the comfort, I couldn't help but feel uneasy. Was there someone in that corner? No, it was just a shadowed coat rack. What was that thing staring at me on the dresser? Oh wow, okay it's a porcelain doll. That's actually creepy. 

I frowned and cozied up to Carol. 

“I told David about everything. He's going to help us keep an eye out,” 
Carol nodded. 

“Do you think you'll be okay to sleep tonight?” She said. 

“With a remote controlled mattress? How could I not?” 

Carol chuckled and we sat there for a while. You can probably guess, but I couldn't sleep. I glanced at my day clothes, the pocket of which contained the phone number for Myles. My brain just kept pointing to it, telling me to get up and call. 

*If you'll actually let me sleep, I will.* I thought. 

I got up and went out into the hall. It was creepy as shit at night, but I didn't want to wake Carol. It took me a moment to dial the number, but soon the phone rang and rang in my ear. I heard a click under the static before it finally picked up. Neither of us said anything for a moment. 

“How did you get this number?” A gravelly voice said. 

“Um, yeah– hi? I'm Megan, or actually legally known as Magdalene Audlin,” I bit my lip. “We need your help. You're Myles?”  

“Margaret Audlin is your mother.” He said. 

“Yeah.” 

“She was hospitalized. Is she dead?” 

“No, but she's really sick with something odd.” I said. The voice cursed.
 
“I warned her, but she wouldn't listen to me. She was never good at that. I'm guessing my associate found you? Told you to call?” 

“Who? No, my mother gave me this number when she was briefly… herself earlier.”

“Fine. Tell me what's happened.”

I relayed my experience for the third time. At least I can say it was getting easier. I went over the nightmares, the music box, the hallway, hallucinations, the hospital that night. 

“She wants us to watch her house. We're here now–” 

“Wait, you went back already? And this hallway is in the house you're staying in?” Myles interrupted. 

“Yeah, is that a problem?” 

“Could be the biggest problem of your life. Whatever you do, do *not* go up there, got it? I'd have preferred if we met up first, but it's too late now. You can't leave until this is settled.” 

I heard another voice in the background, feminine. “And who's fault is that?” They said. Myles didn't reply. I continued. 

“My sister has been having the same nightmares I've been having. Now a man in a red suit showed up. May calls it the ‘suited man’. I don't really understand what–”

“Stop,” The voice interrupted again. “A humanoid in a red suit?” 
“Yeah. He keeps showing up. He keeps telling us to release the monster behind the door.”

“The music box from the museum.” He mumbled.  

“It's from a museum?” I said. 

“Yes. It's something she got at a private auction. A museum that never opened. It shut down and sold its holdings to the upper class. Tell me more about the music.”

“Okay, well, it's something I remember a lot. We had a grandfather clock that played it, and now this music box plays it too. My sister has been hearing the music lately, source-less.”  

I waited, but Myles said nothing. 

“Okay, with all due respect, sir, I've been giving plenty here,” I said.
“If you knew my mother somehow, can you give up some details? Who are you? How did you know my mother?” 

He sighed. 

“It's not safe over the phone. Some of these monsters can use the phones. You've said enough. I'll meet with you. If you're having nightmares and you're already home, then it's already begun. My associate will come ahead of me tomorrow, and look, now's the time to gather the people you trust. Make sure anyone who could be affected by this is either out of the way or in the know. Got it?” 

“Fine.” 

“Fine.” He returned. 

There was a click as he hung up. I pulled my phone away from my face and took a glance at it. 

“Okay then.” I muttered.

I headed back to our room. Carol was sitting up. 

“Hey babe. Nightmares?” She said, stretching. 

“No, I called that Myles guy I told you about. The number my mom gave me? I couldn't stop thinking about it. He's going to come by and help us with all of this. He knows about our situation. There might be some real monsters here.” 

Carol tried to hide her fear. 

“When will he get here?” 

“I don't know. He said his associate will come ahead of him tomorrow.” I said.

“All right, well, come try and get some sleep then.”
 
I nodded and walked over. 

Eventually, I knew I was asleep when it felt like the world was floating. I don't know how long it took. The dream I had that night? Well, I had one all right. I should have known what it meant. I wished I had. Whatever was in the house was waking up. 


*“Awake…”* 
*“They're here, they're home.”*
*“The song, the song!”*
These voices whispered throughout my sleep. Have you ever had a dream where the space around felt infinitely vast, yet contained to where you slept? I know, it doesn't make any sense to say it aloud, but it's how I felt.  
It was like I could sense the house as a living thing, and it could sense me. Dark and shifting shadows danced. The voices whispered to each other, and I heard them passing word ear to ear. Something here had been waiting for us. Something here was waking up. 
*“The sweetling has come? Come closer, little bird. Where are you?”* 


My eyes opened and I glanced at my phone. That's where that last voice had come from, I was sure of it. I checked the lock screen. No notifications at all.

It was still dark when I awoke. Not pitch black, but just before sunrise. Had I really slept that long? Despite my confusion, it was nice to get some sleep. It wasn't quite enough but it was a start. I had maybe two hours before May or Carol woke up, so I got dressed and wandered the house. I stayed away from the third floor, but familiarized myself with the rest. 

I remembered it all. Some places fondly, some not so much. As I walked down the second floor halls, I soon realized that I was close to my mother's room. I didn't like being this close for some reason, but I gathered the courage to glance towards it. Her room was up a small staircase that was still on the second floor. She even had her own private hallway with it. My mother's door laid ahead. Ornate wood carved with intricate designs. It seemed sinister somehow. It felt like some kind of force was urging me back. 

“Screw it, I'm tired of being scared.” I muttered. 

I walked up and frowned when I pulled the handle. It was locked. Even when I tried the keys, it wouldn't budge. 

“So much for the ‘master’ key.” I mumbled. 

A wonderful smell wafted through the halls, distracting me. I knew it right away. It was a fresh breakfast. It summoned me down to the first floor kitchen as surely as a siren song. David and Grant were always quite the duel chefs. 

The kitchen was pristine, white, and beautifully decorated. It was one of the few places my mother had left for David and Grant to decorate. Several types of plants were placed about, copper pans and utensils hung, and colored glass let the sunrise inside. There was also a dining table here with eight chairs. 

“Morning, David.” I said as I walked in. 

He nearly jumped out of his apron.

“My, you got me good, Megan. How are you this morning?” He said.
 
“I'm all right actually. I managed to get some sleep last night.” 

“Good, I'm glad to hear it. I thought that we'd do May's favorite this morning, ‘fancy breakfast’.” 

“Thanks, she'll love it for sure. Where's Grant? He always used to help you in the kitchen.” 

“I'm not sure where he went honestly, but I have something to tell you there,” He glanced around as I stepped up. “Last night I found him at your mother's bedroom door, staring at it all off like. I asked him what he was doing and he simply turned, gave some excuse and left. I didn't like the look in his eye. I thought you should know.” 

“I tried the master key on my mother's room just now. It wouldn't open.” 
David checked the oven. 

“That is odd. Perhaps we should investigate that later today? That reminds me, he has had this odd obsession with the room since your mother was hospitalized. He has made sure that he was the one that kept it up.” 
“Megan? Mister Davie?” 

I looked towards the entrance. 

“Oh, hey May,” I said. “Why are you up so early?” 

She raised an eyebrow. 

“I know, I know. I'm up and all, but you usually sleep more than I do.” I said. 

“Bad dream. About upstairs.” She said.

“Good morning Miss May. Grab a chair, grab a chair. I have a fancy breakfast for you.” 

That brought a bright smile to May's face. 

David brought us silver platters filled with amazing food. For me, freshly peeled and crispy hash browns, a six ounce New York strip, two over easy eggs, and a colorful garden salad. May's favorite was two buttermilk waffles with orange blossom honey, crispy bacon, and scrambled eggs, plus an apple juice. Carol joined us soon after, and was stunned into reverence.

“Can I have a fancy floof?” May asked. David smiled and gently lowered two curled orange slices and fanned spinach. 

“Yay! Fancy breakfast!” May said. 

“Jesus, you have a family crest pressed into the waffles?” Carol said. 

“Just a little joke of Grant's and mine.” David said. 

Needless to say, we all dug in, David too. It was incredible, simply said. I don't miss anything else about this life, but I'll admit that David's cooking will forever hold a place in my heart. 

“Thank you so much.” I said with a mouthful. 

“Of course. If this is a good time for breakfast, I'll keep starting it when I did. Lunch at noon, and dinner at five. Sound fair?” David said.
 
“Sounds good to me.” I said.  

There was an echoing, overdramatic chime down the hall. I rolled my eyes. 

“Is that the doorbell?” Carol chuckled. 
 
“Yep. I'll get it.” I said.

“Can I help keep the garden?” May said to David as I left. 

“There are some leaves to rake out front. We could make a pile to jump in. We'll have to do it before it rains.” David said. His voice trailed off as I went down the hall. 

When I got to the door, I found Grant there. He was opening the door when I arrived. 

“Hey, are you one of the Audlins? It's me, Lenny.” The person at the door said to Grant. 

It was that guy with the southern drawl, carrying a suitcase. I stepped up. 

“Thanks, I have it from here, Grant.” I said. Grant released the door with an odd look on his face. 

“Miss! Good to see you again.” Lenny said. 
 
“Did you follow us here from the hotel? Are you really that desperate for a front page?” 

“No, I wouldn't dream of it. I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier–” I began to close the door and he stopped it. “Wait, all right? Okay. I was sent here by a mutual friend of ours? Myles West?” 
I studied him for a moment.

“Do you mind if I check? Give him a call?” I pulled out my phone. 
“He's not going to pick up,” Lenny said. “He changes his number every time someone calls, even once, but yeah go ahead.” 

Sure enough, I got that message. ‘*We're sorry, the number you've dialed is either unavailable or is no longer connected. Please hang up and try again.*’

“No offense, but how can I trust you then? You want me to just let you in?” 

“That would be lovely. Whatever's cooking smells fantastic,” He said. “But sure, Myles is on his way, but he won't be here until tomorrow. He told me about the nightmares, the music box, your mother's condition, and the other odd things. There. That do it for you?” 

“All right. Fine, come in,” I said. “Grant, could you… Grant?” I looked around. Grant was gone. 

“Where'd that other feller go?” Lenny said. When I said nothing, Lenny continued. “Anyway, so you really are Magdalene Audlin?” 

“Megan.” I said. Lenny gawked at the lobby. 

“Oh, sorry. Myles said you were a rich family, but holy hell. I had no clue. I had a friend that worked at a museum– Oh sorry. I guess I shouldn't swear in front of a lady.” 

“Trust me, swearing is the last fucking thing you should worry about. Is this why you asked after us in the hotel?” 

“It was on Myles’ instructions. We've been hunting for something for a while. Your ‘suited man’. You've seen him right?” 

“Yes. Who are ‘we’? Are you part of a group or something?” I said. 

“Sort of. We're not exactly formal enough to have company tracksuits and golf trips but sure, you could say that.” 

“And what does all this have to do with us? Why is this thing haunting us or whatever?” 

Lenny glanced down towards the kitchen. 

“Look, I'd love to get into it all right now, but really, would– would it be all right if I had some breakfast? I haven't eaten since we met at the hotel. They didn't appreciate the food I stole.” He said. 
I sighed. 

“Fine, but you're going to explain. Got it?” 

He held up his hands defensively. “I promise.” 

We walked into the kitchen. Carol and David glanced at Lenny. May was gone. 

“Could you fix him a plate before you go outside, David? He's a guest that can help with our… predicament.” I said. 

“Sure, Megan.” David said.

“Hey isn't this the guy that was creeping on you at the pool?” Carol said. Lenny looked like he might run when Carol got up.

“He was, but he was actually genuine. It's fine. He's a friend of Myles. Remember that phone call I told you about? This is the associate.” 

“Right.” Carol said and sat. 

Lenny walked past Carol like a puppy past a cat, and sat down as David set him a plate. 

“Thanks, I really do appreciate it.” Lenny said. 

Carol walked me into the hall.  

“So this is the associate, huh?” She said. 

“Yep, seems like it. He started rattling off about Myles before I even said anything.” 

“I'll keep an eye on him for good measure. How was your sleep?” Carol said. 

“Not too bad actually. I managed to get more than I have in a little while. I had an odd dream though.” 

“The hallway?” Carol said. 

“No, this time it was kind of strange. It was sort of about the whole house. I thought I heard something from my phone. That's what woke me up earlier.” 

“Huh, well let me know if anything else happens.”

“Ah, that was a fine meal. Thank you kindly, chef.” Lenny said in the kitchen. 

“Holy shit, he was hungry. That was like five minutes.” I said. Lenny walked out into the hallway as David did. 

“Lenny, this is Carol and David.” 

“Pleasure to meet you,” He shook their hands. “Sorry if you thought I was being creepy at the pool. With everything going on, Myles and I didn't want to wait to find you.” 

“Hello, sir. I hope that you really can help us.” David said. 

“Howdy to meet– I mean, nice to meet you, sir.” Carol said. 

“That's a good one,” Lenny said with a fragile smile. “So anyway, which room is mine?” 

“Excuse me?” I said. 

“If Myles and I are going to help you solve your little problem, we'll need to stay here. Who knows when shit could go down– oh, sorry, pardon my language.”

Carol stepped up. 

“Okay, Texas. You want to help us? You need to stay here? Fine, but I want you to know that my girl has been through Hell, so if there's even a second you give me not to trust you, I'll throw you to the curb from the third floor. Capisce?” 

Lenny swallowed. 

“All right. All right. Look I know things must have you on edge, and we got off on the wrong foot and all. I'm sorry if I was brash.”

“No, I'm sorry, you're right. We're being a little intense.” I said.
 
“It's not a problem. You're more sane about this than anyone I've seen. Truth is, I've dealt with these monsters before. One actually killed my friend John.” 

“You've seen these things before? Do they always look like flesh monsters dumped from Cthulhu's asshole?” I said. 

“Sure, that's an interesting way of putting it. Seen a few before actually. Seen what they can do to someone too. Each one's unique but there's usually long limbs involved, a face with no eyes, patchwork skin, whatever. Crawls at you like something that'd make Satan shit his loincloth.”

“That's like what I saw in my nightmare on the plane.” I said. 

“You saw Satan's loincloth?” Carol chuckled, then saw our expressions. She paused. “Okay, sorry. I'm just trying to imagine that these monsters are actually… real? Humor is my coping mechanism.” 

Lenny glanced at David. 

“It's okay, he knows.” I said. 

“Right. My friend, John,” Lenny began with a nod. “We were on the police force together. We made a big arrest, it was actually Myles we arrested believe it or not. That's kinda how this started. John was going to retire, but the company Myles worked for offered him a job instead. So he took it, and worked at a museum as a night guard. Job was shady as all hell. I tried to talk him out of it at one point. Think I did too, he just wanted to give it one last night to think it over. All it took was that one night. One of these things was in the museum. That thing killed him and others working there, and it… it took over John's body.” Lenny said. 

“Took over his body? Why?” I said. David was disturbed, trying to put something together in his head. 

“Who knows with these monsters.” Lenny said. 

“Something like this would make the news for certain wouldn't it?” Carol said, genuine fear on her face. If she was afraid, this was real.
 
“That's where *they* come in. The people that started it all.” Lenny said. 

“Who?” I said. 

“That's just it. Not even Myles or I know their real names. They run all their OPS through some nameless company. Oh sure they're legally filed under certain things, but all of their companies are a funnel for one secret project. Most assholes that work for 'em just call 'em, ‘Headquarters’. They're real careful about who knows what. They started it all with this dig in a cave in Italy to document ruins or something, and that somehow released these things into the world.”

“If they're so careful, how do you know about it?” Carol asked. 

“I don't know,” Lenny said. “Maybe they're sloppy, maybe they want us to know what we do.”

Carol and I exchanged a glance.

“Yep,” Lenny continued. “You two have the same look on your faces as John did when I told him, but I promise you, it's all real.” 

“I don't even know what to say. I don't want to believe you, but after my dreams?” I trailed off. 

“You've seen 'em. You can't help but believe. Can you tell me more about those nightmares? It might give us a clue where your ‘suited man’ is hiding.” Lenny said. 

“Okay. I dream about a hallway. It's one on the third floor of this house. The door at the end of this hall is the only one down the whole thing, and it's black. It has a golden plate shaped like a moon. One of those things is inside, playing a music box. It's been asking me to release it.” 

“Everyone needs to stay away from that hallway,” Lenny said. “Even if that's the focus, it could be somewhere else in the house though. As long as we stay away, we should be safe until Myles gets here.” Lenny said. 
“*Should* be?” Carol said. 

“I can't really promise. How these things work is still unknown in some ways. We've never heard of one being bound to a music box before, but Myles said capturing this particular one is important. It's some kind of leader to them.” 

“How are you going to help us?” I said. 

“I know a few things but Myles is the real expert here. I'll do my best to keep you safe until he arrives though, just stay away from the third floor,” Lenny said. “We'll figure it out. Just keep everyone accounted for and we'll be fine. So, where am I staying?” 

“Right.” I said. 

We led him to a room in the same hall as ours, just a few doors down. He seemed quite pleased and impressed.

“I'll just get settled in if you don't mind. It'll just be a little while. Oh and here's my number in case anyone needs to reach me.” 

“Thanks. We'll see you around I guess. Lunch at noon, dinner's at five.” I said. 

“I'll be outside raking leaves.” David said. We nodded. 

“Sure thing, and thanks for breakfast too. My friend Jonny would have loved it. Though he would have had to take the onions out.” He said, and closed the door.

Carol and I went towards our own room. We sat inside for a while. 
“So, what's today's plan?” Carol said. 

“I'm not sure. Maybe I'll walk you around the house a little?” 

“Minus the third floor.” Carol said. 

“Minus the third floor,” I agreed. “May and I have a lot of stories for you I'm sure. Speaking of May, did she go help David with the leaves?” 

“I think so.” Carol said. 

“Okay, I can still give you a tour then. Want to wait for me in the lobby? I'll catch up, I've just got to find my jacket.” I said. 
Carol nodded and left the room. 

I looked through my suitcase, but couldn't find my jacket. The night we had packed everything was pretty chaotic. It might have gotten lost or put in someone else's stuff. I check Carol's stuff, nothing. I shrugged and went to find Carol. It wasn't too chilly anyway. 

As I left and went down the hallway, I looked out of the windows. I could see that David had begun raking autumn leaves in the central garden. I smiled. That sight alone brought back a lot of memories. Too many memories really. My smile fell. 

I looked around the yard. Where was May? I didn't see her anywhere. I frowned and pulled out my phone. No messages or anything. 
I knocked on May's door. 

“May? How are you doing?”

No answer. I opened the door a crack. 

“May? Are you in here?” 

Nothing. 

I opened it the rest of the way. My old room was exactly how I had left it. My mom had even left my pink Barbie duvet on the bed. Besides May's tornado of clothes pulled from her suitcase, it was all the same. 
 
I walked in. Her jacket was still on the bed. I checked the bathroom, the bedroom, and the walk-in closet. May was nowhere to be seen. I texted her, waited, and got no response. I was getting worried. 

I called her, but all I heard was, ‘***You have reached the voicemail of–** Um May Audlin, superhero extraordinary*’. I hung up and went down the hall. I leaned over the railing overlooking the foyer. 

“Hey Carol, have you seen May?” I said, voice echoing. She looked up.
 
“Isn't she outside?” 

I shook my head. 

“I don't see her. I called, texted, checked her room, nothing.” 

“I'll go ask David. Don't worry, we'll find her. This place is big enough to lose sight.” Carol said with a smile. That helped a little.  

“May?” I called as I walked the second floor. I checked each bedroom, bathroom, observatory, interior garden, kitchen, and even a ‘drawing room’. She was nowhere to be seen. 

“Where would she go?” I muttered. My mind raced over a mental map of the house. “Maybe mom's room? Could have wanted to sneak in there while mom's gone.” 

I was headed that way anyway. I figured I'd just pass it and see that it was closed. Oddly though, the door *was* partly open. I walked over quietly. 

I glanced into my mother's room. The master bedroom. Bed bigger than a pool, and a single room bigger than our town home. Eloquent, well dressed, and dark. From what I could see, everything looked to be in shambles. Pots knocked over, paintings askew, furniture toppled. 

“May?” 

The name echoed for a moment, then silence fell. The quiet closed around me like darkness on a dying candle. I felt it wrapping around every corner here, peeking out from every half seen room I had already checked. I had intruded on something. I could feel it. A dark pressure like nothing I've felt before. 

My blood froze when I heard it. 

It was louder than anything I'd ever heard before, yet barely audible at the same time. I heard something *drip* from above my mother's bed. It was a dark, viscous liquid. Another drop fell in rhythm.

I looked up. Something rested in the shadows of the ceiling where the drops were coming from. I don't know how I hadn't heard it before, but it was wheezing. It was whispering one line in a voice almost human.
*“Mors Infra, Mors Infra–”* It stopped suddenly with an animal snort. 
Something like a head flashed upright to stare at me. There was a glint of something that might have been eyes. Thin strands of hair draped over its face. 

I wanted to move. I wanted to scream and run, but I couldn't. I just stared at that thing and squeezed the doorknob to my mother's room. My hand shook, as I and that thing stared at each other. 

My phone emitted a sound from my pocket. It carried a strange residue as the speaker said, *“Are you a sweetling? Here all alone, just for me? Hungry. Starving.”*

The thing sniffed the air and crept across the ceiling towards me. 
*Run, run you idiot!* I yelled in my head, but I couldn't move. 
The closer it came to the hall, the less shadowed it was. I saw that the thing really did have eyes, but there was a strange film over them. 
That dark liquid dripped from its mouth. The thing dropped to the floor with a heavy *thump*. It had to have been at least seven feet tall, but it grew taller. Its head stretched up like a fleshy periscope. A long smile of sharp teeth grew and grew as it focused on me. 

My phone echoed again. *“Ah, it is the sweetling. Too long. Eternity. I'm hungry…”*


*Finale next week...*
