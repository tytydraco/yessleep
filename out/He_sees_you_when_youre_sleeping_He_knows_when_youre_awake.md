You know the song. It’s catchy, it stays in your head all day, and that part specifically is creepy. Come on I know some of you agree. It’s the holiday season and life is stressful. Work is always busy, there is always traffic, and getting all the gifts together to wrap is always a pain. BUT it’s all worth it every single time I see that smile and joy on my daughter’s face. She’s five now but ever since she got the concept of Christmas it’s her favorite time of the year. This year is no different, since Thanksgiving she has had her Christmas list ready and is adding things daily.

As the days wore on more and more decorations came out. Inflatables and lights in front of the house, stockings and the Christmas tree inside of the house. To our family this truly is the best time of the year. One of my daughter’s favorite thing to do was to go see Santa at the mall. She would bring her list and before the annual picture she would read off everything she wanted. This year was no different. List in hand my daughter went up to Santa, sat on his lap and then Santa asked that magical question.

“Were you a good girl this year?”

“Yes I sure was Santa. I ate all my veggies, I brushed my teeth, and I did ALL my homework.”

“HO HO HO!! Good job! Santa will make sure you get everything you ask for!”

After a smile and big hug my daughter ran over to me happy to tell me about the news from Santa. When we got home my daughter went on the hunt for my wife to tell her about what Santa had said. She couldn’t hold back the excitement. The last couple of years I had the idea to slowly add more  presents under the tree as Christmas got closer in order to build up the excitement. I explained to my daughter that because Santa had to visit all the little boys and girls all over the world he had to come back a few times to drop more presents off. I obviously would put the presents under the tree while she slept and each morning when she woke up she would try to see what new presents were under the tree. By the time Christmas came the living room was filled with presents.

On the night I laid out the first round of presents I was exhausted. Once I placed out a few I decided to call it a night and headed up the stairs to the bedroom. While laying in bed I was drifting off to sleep when I heard a creak on the stairs followed by the sound of something falling. I quickly stood up and headed for the door. I opened the door and to my surprise my daughter was at the top step with a flashlight in hand.

“Honey what are you doing?”

“I’m tryna see him daddy, I’m trying to see Santa!”

“Oh jeez! I don’t think you’re gonna see him darling he drops the presents off before anyone can see.”

“Oh no daddy I am gonna catch him! You’ll see!”

I laughed and scooped her up to bring her back to her bedroom. I tucked her in and walked back to my  bedroom laughing to myself along the way at how funny she is. The next day was another exhausting day of work with some family time mixed in once I got home. Once we put our daughter down to sleep my second job began. More presents were added under the tree. This time as I was making my way back up the stairs I saw my daughter’s bedroom door crack open ever so slightly. I saw her little feet at the base of the door. I just shook my head with a slight chuckle.

“Hey you!” I whispered “Time to get to bed, I just checked and Santa isn’t here.”

“Oh come on Dad! I know he is coming!”

“Bed please!”

And with that she closed her door and I heard her shuffling back to bed. The next couple of days were rinse and repeat. Work, dinner, bed time, presents. Without fail, every night, I heard my daughter’s door open and footsteps in the hallway. My wife had convinced me to let it play out.

“Just let her do it. She is having fun, I’m sure she will go to sleep once she doesn’t see anything.”

“You’re right, she will just be excited to see more gifts under the tree.”

It was now Christmas Eve and the tree was almost fully surrounded by presents at least a foot high. After my nightly routine I peaked into my daughter’s room to make sure she was sound asleep and she was. I made my way back to my room and climbed in bed. I was waiting to hear her door and  footsteps in the hallway like every night but this time all I heard was the sound of my wife snoring. I thought maybe she finally realized she wasn’t going to “catch” Santa. To be honest it made me a little sad. I thought it was adorable and it really showed how innocent she was. The night went on and I didn’t hear a peep from her room. When she woke up I had breakfast made.

“No luck with Santa last night?”

She had a huge smile on her face. “Oh I saw him Daddy, I saw SANTA!!!”

I was curious to where this was going so I played along. “Oh did you now?!”

“I sure did, he came to my room and asked if I was a good little girl this year.”

Well that was kind of creepy.

“I told him I was and he told meeeee that if I wanted to get even more presents that I should stay in bed and stop trying to catch him.”

“Oh, okay honey, that’s good.”

Alright that is extremely strange. What an odd imagination my daughter had, I thought. Maybe she saw me putting the gifts under the tree and didn’t want to ruin the “magic” of Christmas so she made up this whacky story. That has to be it. I went to work that day and the image of “Santa” in my daughter’s room stayed with me. By the time I got home I was pooped. I only had a few more presents to put out and Christmas was tomorrow. I figured once my daughter went to sleep I would put out the last presents, set up a plate with cookies and milk, and then take my exhausted self to bed. To say I knocked out was an understatement. The long days have caught up to me and they were starting to take a toll. It was going to be all over soon and well worth it.

My daughter came sprinting in our room on Christmas morning.

“MOMMY, DADDY!!! WAKE UP!! IT’S CHRISTMAS!!!”

“I’m up! I’m up!” I shouted.

She ran down the stairs and we followed close behind. She was ecstatic and could not wait to open her presents. I told her she could start with whatever present she wanted. Before I could finish the sentence she was already ripping wrapping paper off the biggest one. In all the excitement I looked around the room and noticed that the cookies that I had placed out were all gone and the glass of milk was empty but toppled over. I thought to myself that my wife had gone to extra mile to make it more believable.

“Nice touch babe”

“Huh? What do you mean?”

“The cookies and the milk. She is definitely gonna think Santa devoured that.”

“Uhhh I didn’t do anything.” She said with a nervous laugh. “I figured that was you. Along with these boot prints that you left on the floor.”

I wasn’t wearing boots. I was too tired last night to do any of the “extra” stuff. Did our daughter eat the cookies? I mean maybe but that wouldn’t explain the boot prints. That’s when I saw it. A gift that didn’t look familiar. A gift that I hadn’t put under the tree. Eloquently wrapped with a big bow and tag on it. I walked over to it and looked at the tag. The tag read “To the good little girl.” What the hell is this? I sat down on the floor and began to unwrap it.

“Hey daddy, that’s not yours!” My daughter yelled.

I continued to unwrap it. I lifted the lid of the box. Inside there were pictures. Dozens and dozens of pictures. Pictures of us sleeping, of my daughter sleeping, pictures of us leaving the house. “What the fuck is this?” Pictures of us at the mall, my daughter sitting on Santa’s lap. There was a note at the bottom of the box.

“Thank you for being such a good girl. I’ve been watching you to make sure you weren’t lying. I hope you like the presents I left. Love Santa”

I stood up, pictures falling all over the floor. I heard my daughter laugh with excitement.

“Ohhhh I love it daddy! This is my favorite teddy bear ever! It even sings a song!”

My daughter gave the bear a squeeze.

“He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when you’re awake, he knows if you’ve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake.”
