My great-grandfather fought during World War One as an infantryman in the British Army. I grew up hearing tales of the Great War, passed down from my great-grandfather, to my grandparents, to my parents, to me. I remember being told about how my great-grandfather earned a Distinguished Conduct Medal for manning a Vickers machine gun all by himself to cover a retreat after the original crew were slain by an enemy rifleman. They told me he once tossed a German potato masher grenade right back into no man’s land only seconds before it detonated. I remember looking at an old black and white photograph of him as a young man, shortly after the war, and noticing the eyepatch which obscured the scarred hole left behind from a German stormtrooper’s knife.

About a week ago I was going through my grandmother’s things after she passed away, and stumbled across a slim, leatherbound notebook. Opening the cover, I noticed that the first paged was signed with my great-grandfather’s name. I read the entire manuscript in a matter of an hour or so. It wasn’t particularly long, and what was contained within was so bizarre that I couldn’t help but read it cover to cover.

What follows is a transcription of my great-grandfather’s journal, mildly edited for my own privacy. Names and certain other minor details have been slightly altered and/or obfuscated, so as to avoid any unscrupulous individuals using this information to find out who I am.

My name is Raymond Philips, and what I am about to describe I have never written down nor told anyone about before now. I am an old man, and I am afraid that I do not have long on this Earth. I do not fear death, God knows I faced it countless times, but I do fear the loss of knowledge that my demise may bring about.

During my service in the British Army from 1916 until my honorable discharge in 1918, I had three separate, horrifying experiences which are permanently seared into my memory like a brand upon skin. I’m afraid I cannot provide the specific dates for these events, as I did not enter them into my diary when they occurred, and time washes away from memory all things not safely recorded in ink or trauma. As a younger man, I convinced myself they were mere delusions, the product of some brain fever brought on by the rigors of combat. With the certainty of age, however, comes clarity, and the understanding that what happened to me was real.

My first experience with what some may call the “paranormal” occurred at some point in 1916. At that time the war on the Western Front was a bit of a stalemate, with neither side gaining much ground over the other. I found myself stationed in the trenches of Northeastern France. It was while we were moving in to relieve the troops at the front line that I got the first hint of what was to come.

As we were getting settled in, I took notice of a young man in a stretcher. He was gibbering and yelling quite loudly about “those horrible, infernal rats”, and seemed to be thrashing about rather intensely. Looking closer, I noticed he was strapped down, with wild eyes staring out desperately. At the time I assumed it was some strange form of shellshock.

In any event, I got myself all settled in for the upcoming days of tense boredom which characterized one’s stay on the front lines. There was never enough to do to occupy one’s time, but at the same time you could never truly relax, not in a place like that. The infrequent sounds of gunfire and artillery made staying calm a Herculean feat. It was nearly always cold and damp, with rats scurrying underfoot. While the verminous little beasties were far from pleasant, I still didn’t quite understand how they could frighten the chap in the stretcher so badly, not when there were so many other, more practical horrors with which to occupy one’s mind. Even on the quietest of days you’d need to keep your wits about you, death was always nearby. There were almost daily casualties, one or two men dying from disease, artillery, or a well-placed shot from a German rifle on the other side of no man’s land.

The bodies of the dead, when we could safely recover them, were stacked up in a relatively unused portion of the trench and covered with a blanket. They would remain there until such time as they could receive some form of proper burial. Standing guard in that particular area was, obviously, not a particularly enviable position. I found myself on guard duty one night, relatively isolated from the rest of the men. Nobody ever slept too close to the corpse pile, so I didn’t even have an unconscious companion to break the stillness with snoring. I was alone, with only the distant roar of artillery and a pile of the dead to keep me company.
