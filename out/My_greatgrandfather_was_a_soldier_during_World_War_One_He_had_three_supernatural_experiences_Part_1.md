[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z9wfw2/my_greatgrandfather_was_a_soldier_during_world/)  


My great-grandfather fought during World War One as an infantryman in the British Army. I grew up hearing tales of the Great War, passed down from my great-grandfather, to my grandparents, to my parents, to me. I remember being told about how my great-grandfather earned a Distinguished Conduct Medal for manning a Vickers machine gun all by himself to cover a retreat after the original crew were slain by an enemy rifleman. They told me he once tossed a German potato masher grenade right back into no man’s land only seconds before it detonated. I remember looking at an old black and white photograph of him as a young man, shortly after the war, and noticing the eyepatch which obscured the scarred hole left behind from a German stormtrooper’s knife.

About a week ago I was going through my grandmother’s things after she passed away, and stumbled across a slim, leatherbound notebook. Opening the cover, I noticed that the first paged was signed with my great-grandfather’s name. I read the entire manuscript in a matter of an hour or so. It wasn’t particularly long, and what was contained within was so bizarre that I couldn’t help but read it cover to cover.

What follows is a transcription of my great-grandfather’s journal, mildly edited for my own privacy. Names and certain other minor details have been slightly altered and/or obfuscated, so as to avoid any unscrupulous individuals using this information to find out who I am.

My name is Raymond Philips, and what I am about to describe I have never written down nor told anyone about before now. I am an old man, and I am afraid that I do not have long on this Earth. I do not fear death, God knows I faced it countless times, but I do fear the loss of knowledge that my demise may bring about.

During my service in the British Army from 1916 until my honorable discharge in 1918, I had three separate, horrifying experiences which are permanently seared into my memory like a brand upon skin. I’m afraid I cannot provide the specific dates for these events, as I did not enter them into my diary when they occurred, and time washes away from memory all things not safely recorded in ink or trauma. As a younger man, I convinced myself they were mere delusions, the product of some brain fever brought on by the rigors of combat. With the certainty of age, however, comes clarity, and the understanding that what happened to me was real.

My first experience with what some may call the “paranormal” occurred at some point in 1916. At that time the war on the Western Front was a bit of a stalemate, with neither side gaining much ground over the other. I found myself stationed in the trenches of Northeastern France. It was while we were moving in to relieve the troops at the front line that I got the first hint of what was to come.

As we were getting settled in, I took notice of a young man in a stretcher. He was gibbering and yelling quite loudly about “those horrible, infernal rats”, and seemed to be thrashing about rather intensely. Looking closer, I noticed he was strapped down, with wild eyes staring out desperately. At the time I assumed it was some strange form of shellshock.

In any event, I got myself all settled in for the upcoming days of tense boredom which characterized one’s stay on the front lines. There was never enough to do to occupy one’s time, but at the same time you could never truly relax, not in a place like that. The infrequent sounds of gunfire and artillery made staying calm a Herculean feat. It was nearly always cold and damp, with rats scurrying underfoot. While the verminous little beasties were far from pleasant, I still didn’t quite understand how they could frighten the chap in the stretcher so badly, not when there were so many other, more practical horrors with which to occupy one’s mind. Even on the quietest of days you’d need to keep your wits about you, death was always nearby. There were almost daily casualties, one or two men dying from disease, artillery, or a well-placed shot from a German rifle on the other side of no man’s land.

The bodies of the dead, when we could safely recover them, were stacked up in a relatively unused portion of the trench and covered with a blanket. They would remain there until such time as they could receive some form of proper burial. Standing guard in that particular area was, obviously, not a particularly enviable position. I found myself on guard duty one night, relatively isolated from the rest of the men. Nobody ever slept too close to the corpse pile, so I didn’t even have an unconscious companion to break the stillness with snoring. I was alone, with only the distant roar of artillery and a pile of the dead to keep me company.

As I stood there, cigarette in one hand, rifle in the other, I began to hear the sound of faint digging, as if mud was being moved aside with a small trowel. I looked around for the source of the noise, wondering if it was just my imagination or, God forbid, the Germans were tunneling into our trench. Extinguishing my cigarette in the damp mud, I readied my rifle and affixed its bayonet, preparing myself to fight and sound the alarm if need be.

As I peered about the trench, I noticed a hint of movement from under the blanket which obscured the bodies of the dead. The sound of digging continued, and my heart began to thump louder in my chest as I approached its source.

Very gently, using my bayonet, I lifted the edge of the blanket. As I did so I caught a glimpse of the rotting, disfigured face of the man beneath it, and had to look away for a moment to wretch. When I composed myself, I looked again, and saw with horror that the body appeared to be moving slightly. My face went pale as I grew worried about the possibility that the dead man may be awakening, until I realized that the corpse was being pulled towards the side of the trench, as if someone within the wall was grasping it by the ankles to drag it into some unseen tunnel.

Determined now, I lifted the blanket off the pile entirely, aiming my rifle towards what I thought was the source of the digging sound and the corpse’s movement. I gasped in abject horror as I saw a pair of scabrous, sharp-tipped claws extending out of the trench wall from a crudely dug hole, grabbing hold of the corpse with both hands. I was shaking with fright, causing me to miss my shot at the beast and hit one of the corpses instead, causing a splash of coagulated blood to spray out of the bullet hole. There was a monstrous screech, as though the sound of some overgrown rodent, and the claws retreated back into the hole, the makeshift tunnel collapsing as it did so.

I stood careful watch over the corpse pile for the rest of my shift, listening intently for any sounds of scratching or digging, but none came. Nobody questioned the gunshot the day after, as we were all fairly used to gunfire by night in the trenches, and so I gave no explanation for it.

I would like to say that was my only encounter with one of those vile creatures, but I did have one more, a few weeks after the first. One of the officers got it into his head that we ought to sneak across no man’s land by night and conduct a small trench raid. A few unfortunate lads, including myself, were assigned to the raid, and at around midnight we went marching off towards the German trench under cover of darkness.

We were about halfway through no man’s land when one of my comrades, a chap by the name of Corporal Douglass I believe, was shot in the chest by a German sniper. As he fell, spluttering and coughing up blood, I ducked down to the ground, looking for cover. I found it in the form of a small crater, evidently formed from an artillery shell detonation. I dragged Douglass into the crater as I heard the chatter of machine gun fire meld with the screams of the dying. Evidently either the German army was more attentive than we had expected, or we weren’t nearly so stealthy as we thought.

I took a look at the Corporal’s wound, paying mind not to raise my head over the edge of our makeshift shelter. It looked bad, worse than the simple soldier like myself had any chance to mend. Still, I did what I could. I poured a bit of whiskey from Douglass’s hip flask on to the bullet hole, giving the rest to him to drink. Then, using my knife, I cut a strip of cloth from my tunic into a makeshift bandage, wrapping it around the wound to keep some pressure on it and staunch the flow of blood.

All the while, as I worked on caring for Corporal Douglass’s injury, my ears were assaulted with the sounds of gunfire and shrieks of agony. I tuned it out as best as I could, focusing on what could be done, rather than the all-pervading death which surrounded us.

Eventually, after some minutes, the sounds of combat stopped. I surmised that one of two things had ocurred; either our lads had reached the German trench and slain the defenders, or, that the bodies of my fallen comrades were currently enriching the soil with their own spilt blood.

Taking off my helmet, I placed it on the end of my rifle, and extended it upwards into the sky, just barely peaking over the edge of the crater. In an instant, the helmet went flying off into the darkness with a resounding *clang* as the report of a German rifle echoed in the distance. Evidently Douglass and I were pinned down.

Douglass had been silent throughout this whole business, save for the occasional gurgle or groan of pain. I figured the poor chap was in shock, given the extent of his injury. I wished I had a blanket of some kind to give him, I’d read somewhere about that being an effective remedy in these circumstances.

With nothing else to be done, I lit a cigarette and began to smoke, trying to steady my frayed nerves. I offered one to Douglass, but he didn’t seem to even notice it, he just continued staring straight ahead while wheezing.

A few hours must have passed, it must have been perhaps two or three o’clock in the morning, when I heard the sound of claws digging through dirt and mud. The familiar noise sent a shiver up my spine, and I peered around the crater, rifle at the ready. It was rather difficult to see purely by moonlight, but I noticed some earth crumbling at the far end of the crater. Raising my rifle to my shoulder, I aimed for the spot and pulled the trigger.

I was greeted with a quiet click.

Panicking, I ejected the cartridge and cycled a new one into the chamber, hoping it was merely a problem with the ammunition rather than the gun’s mechanism. Once again I aimed and squeezed the trigger, praying. A faint click emanated from the weapon, and nothing else happened.

Cursing, I tossed the rifle aside, looking around for some other weapon with which to defend Douglass and myself. I of course had my knife, but having seen the claws of that thing in the trench, I had no desire to try my luck in hand-to-hand combat. I could see its claws emerging from the ground, sharp and rodent-like. Finally, my eyes landed on the Corporal’s revolver, and I swiftly grabbed it from the holster and fired a shot towards the unholy beast. Thankfully, the sidearm seemed to be in perfect working condition, and the projectile struck true. There was an awful shriek, something like a cross between a rat’s squeak and the wailing of a man in pain, and the claws fell limp. Though I still couldn’t see the thing’s face buried in the mud, evidently I had correctly guessed its position and put the bastard out of its misery.

I clapped Corporal Douglass on the shoulder and whooped in glee, but my celebration proved to be short lived. Scarcely had the expression of joy left my lips when I heard the sound of tunneling once again, this time to my right. I aimed the pistol at the sound of the disturbed earth and waited. My hands were shaking through a combination of adrenaline and fear, so it was difficult to steady my aim. I decided to wait until I could see the whites of my hitherto unseen foe’s eyes, so as to ensure the best shot possible.

As it turned out, the creature that emerged from the dirt didn’t have eyes. A snout covered in greasy, pockmarked skin popped out of the earth, snuffling as it began to pull the rest of its bulk through the crude tunnel with its enormous claws. It was roughly man-shaped, resembling some sort of quadrupedal ape, though in overall appearance it suggested nothing so much as an overgrown, mangy rat. A set of sharp, jagged incisors extended out from its lips, as it continued to sniff the air, evidently looking for food.

After several seconds I finally regained my composure enough to pull the trigger. Unfortunately, in my panic, I unloaded not one, but five rounds into the beast, only stopping when Corporal Douglass’s revolver ran out of ammunition. I continued pulling the trigger long after the beast had howled its death cry and slumped to the ground, motionless.

Exhausted and under considerable mental strain, I finally put down the revolver and pulled out my cigarettes yet again, though the shaking of my hands made lighting one fairly difficult. It must have been a half hour or so after I shot the thing that the digging started up again. This time I heard it from all around me.

I grabbed once more for the Corporal’s pistol, before realizing it was still out of ammunition. Panicking, I rummaged about at his belt, looking for a speedloader. Corporal Douglass continued his heavy, gurgling breathing, still completely unresponsive. It took me a few moments to notice the corpse of the thing I had shot earlier being dragged back down into the hole from whence it came. Either the daemoniac things had some sort of burial ritual for their dead, or, more likely, they possessed no moral objections to cannibalism.

I finally found Douglass’s spare ammunition, and fumbled with the revolver, attempting to reload it as swiftly as possible. In my haste, I accidentally peaked my head up slightly above the rim of the crater, and heard the whiz of a bullet pass by inches from my ear. Quickly I fell back down to the ground, but dropped the speedloader in the process.

Scrabbling about in the mud for the fallen object, I heard digging from right next to me, from where Corporal Douglass lay.  I looked up and saw a set of those awful, clawed hands pawing at him, beginning to drag him into the ground. Screaming in a combination of rage and terror, I drew my knife and attempted to stab at the vile claws, but I missed my mark, driving my knife into the dirt instead. The thing grasping Douglass reached out its claw and slashed at my arm, causing me to yelp in pain as I staggered backwards.

Doing my best to try and stop the bleeding, I watched in terror as those awful claws pulled poor Douglass into the burrow from which they emerged, all the while he groaned and gurgled senselessly. I wept in horror, and, quite out of my mind, ran out of the crater and towards our trench.

As for how I survived that perilous flight across no man’s land, I have no idea, it must have been blind luck I suppose. In any event, I awoke a few days later in a battlefield hospital, screaming about rats. A doctor told me I was suffering from some sort of brain fever, and that I should be fine after a few days of rest.

Nobody asked me about Corporal Douglass, and so, like with my first encounter with those inhuman monsters, I proferred no explanation.

I never met with any of those horrid creatures again, thankfully, but the war was far from over, and there was plenty more time to come face to face with unimaginable horrors, both mundane and supernatural.

I will work on transcribing the remaining two entries as soon as I have time. I tried doing some research to see if any other soldiers on the Western front described similar creatures, and found disturbing results. Though I was unable to find any convincing first hand sources, there are numerous references to so-called “ratmen” or “trench ghouls” in a variety of publications relating to supernatural events during the Great War. If I find anything more solid, I’ll be sure to bring it up in the follow-up post.
