My son Ethan is four. Like most kids his age, he has an imaginary friend.

His name is Mr. Longneck.

He showed up about two months ago. At first, I thought it was sweet—Ethan would leave little snacks out for him at night. Carrot sticks, a cookie. He’d whisper things to the dark corners of his room and laugh quietly to himself.

“He’s really tall, Daddy,” Ethan said one morning. “He has to bend down to come in my room.”

“Wow,” I said. “What’s he look like?”

Ethan giggled. “He doesn’t like it when I say.”

I figured it was just the start of an active imagination.

Then the stories started.

“Mr. Longneck says the man across the street is going to cry soon.”

“Why?”

“Because his wife is going to fall down the stairs.”

Two days later, I came home from work to flashing red lights on our street. Ambulance, police. Mrs. Halbrook, the sweet old lady who always wore house slippers outside, had tripped on her basement stairs. Broke her neck.

It shook me up, but I tried to rationalize it. Coincidence. My mind playing tricks. Four-year-olds say weird stuff all the time, right?

I didn’t sleep well that night.

Over the next few weeks, it got worse. Ethan started saying things that *no* four-year-old should know.

He knew about a teacher in town who’d been caught sexting a student. That never made the papers—it had been kept under wraps.

He told me, totally casually over breakfast, that “Mr. Longneck says Aunt Becca cries in the bathtub when nobody’s home.”

Becca is my sister. She lives alone. And yeah… I’d had that exact same thought, but never told a soul.

I started paying more attention.

Ethan only talked about Mr. Longneck at night.

Once, I passed his room and heard him whispering, almost reverently: “Okay. Okay. I will.”

When I peeked in, he was sitting up in bed. Smiling.

“Everything okay, buddy?”

He nodded. “Mr. Longneck says hi.”

I checked every inch of his room. Nothing. No toys, no creepy dolls. Just my son. Alone.

I started to feel watched in my own home. Like when I was shaving, I’d glance up and see movement in the foggy mirror—too tall to be my reflection. Just a sliver of someone ducking out of view.

I chalked it up to stress.

Then Ethan got sick.

Really sick.

We took him to the hospital when he couldn’t stop vomiting. The doctors said it was norovirus, but his fever was pushing 105. He was delirious. Talking in his sleep. One night, I stayed with him in the hospital room while he twitched and mumbled.

Around 3AM, he sat bolt upright, staring at the dark window. “He’s here,” he said.

I looked. Just my own reflection. No—wait.

Something was behind me. Tall. Slender. I swear I saw it duck as soon as I turned to look.

“Who’s here, Ethan?” I asked.

He turned to me with wide eyes. “He says you need to listen now.”

“To what?”

But Ethan just lay back down and closed his eyes.

The next morning, his fever broke.

That night, I had a dream.

I was standing in Ethan’s room. Except everything was wrong—elongated, like the walls had been stretched upward. The corners of the room were deep shadows, too dark to see into.

Then I heard it. Breathing.

Slow. Wet. Right behind me.

When I turned, I saw a shape in the corner. Towering. Its neck bent at an impossible angle, the head low enough to meet mine.

Its face wasn’t a face. Just skin stretched taut across a skull. No mouth. No eyes. Just a slit of darkness where a neck should’ve ended.

And it *spoke* to me.

Not in words, but in thoughts. Feelings. Like pressure behind my eyes.

**You don’t listen. But he does.**

I woke up drenched in sweat.

Ethan was already awake, sitting at the breakfast table.

“He says you had the dream,” he whispered.

I stared at my son. “Ethan… what does Mr. Longneck *want*?”

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he reached for his cereal and said, “He says the man upstairs should stop hurting his wife.”

We live in a duplex. The man upstairs is quiet. Keeps to himself. We barely talk.

That afternoon, police arrested him for domestic abuse. His wife had been hiding a broken wrist for weeks.

I don’t know how much more of this I can take.

It’s like Mr. Longneck *knows things*. Like he’s using Ethan. Grooming him for something.

And now… it’s gotten worse.

Last night, Ethan came into our room at 2AM.

He wasn’t crying. Just standing at the foot of the bed.

“He wants to talk to *you* now, Daddy,” he said.

“He says you’re ready.”

I asked him what that meant, but he didn’t respond. Just went back to bed.

It’s 1:43 AM as I’m writing this. I can’t sleep.

And now… I can hear it.

Breathing.

From the closet.

Low. Wet. Slow.

Getting closer.
