I didn’t want to come. Not really. Camping had never been my thing, but when Allison looked at me with those bright green eyes and said, “You’re coming, right, André?” how could I say no? She smiled when I nodded, and that was enough to convince me.

It was Slex’s idea—because of course it was. Slex was always the loud, brash one, the self-appointed leader of our group. He didn’t take “no” for an answer, and he had this way of making you feel small if you resisted. So when he announced one afternoon, “We’re going camping. All of us. Out by Willow Creek,” we didn’t argue.

Greg groaned, leaning against the wall of the diner where we all hung out. “Do we have to? I’ve got a lot going on.”

“You’re coming,” Slex snapped. “Stop being a baby.”

Victoria smiled, running her fingers through her dark hair. “If Greg’s going, I’m going.” She always looked at him like he was the last soda in the desert, but Greg never seemed to notice.

Susanne, sweet as always, chimed in with, “It’ll be fun! We’ll make s’mores and tell ghost stories.”

And then there was Allison. Her soft laugh carried across the table, and she glanced at me. “It’s settled, then. All of us.”

So that’s how it happened.

The first night started fine.

We set up our tents in a small clearing just a few miles from the creek. The air was crisp, the sky painted with streaks of orange and purple as the sun dipped below the trees. Allison and I worked together to set up our tent, and my hands shook every time her fingers brushed against mine.

Greg was quieter than usual, looking pale and tired as he struggled to hammer down stakes. “You okay?” I asked him.

“Yeah, just… didn’t sleep much last night.” He shrugged, forcing a weak grin.

Slex was barking orders the entire time, snapping at everyone for moving too slow. “Jesus, Greg, hurry up. It’s not rocket science!”

Victoria rolled her eyes. “Why don’t you do it yourself, Slex?”

“Because I’m busy keeping you all from screwing up.”

Susanne, ever the peacekeeper, laughed nervously. “Let’s all just relax, okay? We’re supposed to be having fun.”

By the time the fire was crackling, the tension had mostly faded. We passed around a bottle of cheap whiskey Slex had smuggled in his bag, and Greg finally seemed to loosen up. Victoria stayed close to him, their laughter mingling in the night air. Allison sat beside me, her shoulder brushing against mine, and my heart raced every time she looked my way.

For a while, it felt… perfect.

The first strange thing happened just after midnight.

Greg stood abruptly, mumbling something about needing to pee. He wandered off into the woods, flashlight in hand. We didn’t think much of it—until fifteen minutes passed. Then twenty.

“Where the hell is he?” Slex muttered, standing up.

“He probably just got lost,” Victoria said, though she didn’t sound convinced. “Someone should go look for him.”

Slex grabbed his flashlight. “Fine. I’ll get him. The idiot probably fell into a bush or something.”

We watched the beam of his light disappear into the trees.

Five minutes later, he came back alone.

“Did you find him?” Allison asked.

Slex shook his head, his jaw tight. “No. But… I found this.” He held up Greg’s flashlight, the glass cracked, the handle smeared with something dark.

Victoria gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “What is that?”

“Looks like blood,” Slex said grimly.

A cold knot formed in my stomach.

The panic set in fast.

Victoria was crying, clutching Greg’s hoodie that he’d left behind. Susanne tried to comfort her, though I could see the fear in her eyes too. Slex paced by the fire, cursing under his breath.

“We have to call someone,” Allison said, her voice trembling.

“No service out here,” Slex snapped, holding up his phone. “We’re in the middle of nowhere.”

“Then we go look for him,” I said, surprising even myself. My voice shook, but the thought of Greg—hurt, alone in the woods—was too much.

Slex nodded. “Fine. You and me. Let’s go.”

“All of us should stick together,” Susanne said.

“No,” Slex barked. “Somebody has to stay here. If he comes back, we don’t want him wandering into an empty camp.”

So we split up.

Slex and I took one direction, flashlights cutting through the darkness. The woods felt different now—too quiet, too still. The usual hum of insects and rustling leaves was gone, replaced by an oppressive silence that made the hairs on my neck stand up.

I tried to make small talk, but Slex wasn’t having it. He snapped at me to shut up, muttering about how this was all Greg’s fault.

And then we found him.

Or… what was left of him.

Greg’s body was slumped against a tree, his head tilted at an impossible angle. His eyes were wide open, frozen in a look of pure terror. Deep, jagged cuts crisscrossed his chest, and his arms hung limp at his sides, the fingers twisted and broken.

I stumbled back, bile rising in my throat.

“What the…” Slex whispered, his voice shaking. He stepped closer, shining his flashlight over the body. “What the hell did this?”

That’s when I saw it.

A figure in the distance, just barely visible in the faint beam of my light. It was tall—too tall—and impossibly thin. Its skin was a sickly, bleach-white color, stretched tight over protruding bones. Its mouth was enormous, filled with jagged, yellow teeth that gleamed in the dark.

It tilted its head, and I swear I heard it laugh.

“Run,” I whispered.

Slex didn’t move. “What are you—”

“RUN!”

The creature lunged, and I bolted, Slex’s screams echoing behind me. I didn’t look back.

When I burst into the camp, the others were huddled around the fire.

“It’s here!” I shouted, my chest heaving.

“What are you talking about?” Allison asked, her face pale.

“Something’s out there! It—it killed Greg!”

And then we heard it.

A low, guttural growl, followed by the sound of branches snapping.

The Yarnhaster had found us.


Susanne was the next to go. She didn’t even hesitate when the Yarnhaster came charging out of the shadows. She pushed Victoria behind her, arms outstretched like a mother shielding her child.

I’ll never forget the sound it made—the way it howled with twisted delight as it sank those jagged teeth into her neck. Susanne’s scream was short, choked off as blood poured from her throat, and then the thing dragged her into the darkness.

Victoria screamed, stumbling backward, and I grabbed her arm. “Run!”

She was crying, trying to pull away. “We can’t leave her! André, we can’t just—”

“She’s gone!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “If we don’t move, we’ll be next!”

Slex was already running. He didn’t even look back as Susanne’s blood soaked into the dirt.

The next few minutes were chaos.

We sprinted through the woods, flashlights swinging wildly, the beam bouncing off the trees. The creature’s guttural growls followed us, closer with every step.

Slex was ahead, barking at us to keep up, but his confidence was gone. His voice shook, panic dripping from every word.

Then he stopped.

I almost slammed into him, skidding to a halt as he froze, staring at something in the distance. Victoria was right behind me, gasping for air.

“Why did you stop?” I hissed.

He didn’t answer.

Then I saw it.

The Yarnhaster stood on a fallen log just ahead, its head cocked to the side, those gleaming yellow teeth stretching into something almost like a smile.

Slex let out a strangled noise, backing up slowly. “We… we can’t fight it,” he mumbled, his voice barely audible.

“No,” I said, grabbing his arm. “But we can run.”

He shook me off. “You run if you want. I’m not going down like that.”

Before I could stop him, he picked up a branch—a flimsy piece of wood—and charged.

I don’t know what he thought he could do. The creature let him get close, almost like it was amused, before lashing out with claws so sharp they looked like knives. It caught him in the stomach, and his scream turned into a wet, gurgling sound as he crumpled to the ground.

I grabbed Victoria and ran.

We didn’t make it far.

Victoria tripped over a root, crashing to the ground with a cry. I stopped, just for a second, but I could hear it behind us—the rapid thud of its bony limbs hitting the forest floor.

“Get up!” I shouted, grabbing her arm.

She shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “I can’t! André, I can’t—”

A shadow loomed over us.

I let go.

I don’t know why. Maybe it was instinct—maybe it was cowardice. But I let go, and I ran.

Her screams followed me, echoing through the trees until they were abruptly cut off.

Now it’s just me.

Me, and Allison.

She’s sitting across from me, her green eyes wide with fear. We’ve barricaded ourselves in my tent, but I know it won’t hold. The fire outside has burned down to embers, casting faint shadows against the canvas walls.

The growls are getting closer.

“Allison,” I whisper, my voice trembling. “If it comes in… I’ll distract it. You run, okay?”

She shakes her head, her lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m not leaving you.”

“Please,” I say. “You have to.”

Before she can respond, the growling stops.

The silence is worse.

I can hear my heartbeat, loud and erratic, as we sit there, waiting.

And then the tent shakes.

Allison screams, scrambling backward as the thin fabric tears open, and the Yarnhaster steps inside. Its long, skeletal frame blocks out the faint light, and its teeth gleam as it lets out a low, rumbling growl.

“Allison,” I whisper, standing up. “Run.”

She doesn’t move.

The creature lunges, and I throw myself at it, slamming into its bony torso. It’s like hitting a brick wall, and I’m knocked to the ground.

“Allison, GO!” I shout, crawling backward as it towers over me.

This time, she listens.

I hear her footsteps pounding away as the creature leans down, its face inches from mine. Its breath smells like rot and copper, and its yellow eyes gleam with something I can only describe as amusement.

I close my eyes.

This is it.

But it doesn’t kill me.

Not yet.

Instead, it leans closer, its voice a low, guttural whisper that seems to come from everywhere at once.

“Run.”

And then it’s gone.

I don’t know why it let me live.

When I stumbled out of the woods hours later, Allison was waiting by the road, tears streaming down her face as she threw her arms around me.

We didn’t speak on the drive back.

Now, weeks later, I still don’t understand. Did it let me go because I ran? Because I was the last one left? Or is it still out there, waiting for the right moment to finish what it started?

I don’t have answers.

But if you’re reading this—if someone finds this—please, stay out of the woods.

And whatever you do, don’t look it in the eyes.
