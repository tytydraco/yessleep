It was a fun little adventure. Exploring through the trees, hearing all kinds of birds and insect life. One big problem with Vietnam is there are always mosquitos everywhere, and surprise surprise, the jungle was no different. I still had a hard time getting acquainted with the Vietnamese heat, but luckily the hottest days of the year had come and gone. It was a rather cloudy day, but I figured if I got too hot in the jungle, I could potentially look forward to some much-welcomed rain. Although I was very much enjoying myself, even with the heat and biting critters, Aaron’s crew insisted on stopping every 10 minutes to document our journey. This was their expedition after all, so I guess we couldn’t complain. 

I got to know Aaron’s colleagues a little better. The two guys were Steve (the hairy guy) and Miles the cameraman. They were nice enough guys I guess, but what was kind of annoying was Miles would occasionally film me and the group, even though we weren’t supposed to be in the documentary. The maroon-haired girl of their group was Sophie. The two of us got along really great and we talked about what it was like for each of us back home. Sophie was actually raised in the Appalachians in a family of all boys - and already knew how to use a firearm by the time she was ten. Even though we were completely different people, I really cared for her, because like me, she clearly didn’t have the easiest of upbringings – as I noticed under her tattoos were a number of scars. A creepy little quirk she had was whenever we heard an unusual noise, she would rather casually say the same thing... ‘If you see something, no you didn’t. If you hear something, no you didn’t...’ 

We had been hiking through the jungle for a few hours now, and there was still no sign of the mysterious trail. Aaron did say all we needed to do was continue heading north-west and we would eventually stumble upon it. But it was by now that our group were beginning to complain, as it appeared we were making our way through just a regular jungle - that wasn’t even unique enough to be put on a tourist map. What were we doing here? Why weren’t we on our way to Hue City or Ha Long Bay? These were the questions our group were beginning to ask, and although I didn’t say it out loud, it was now what I was asking... But as it turned out, we were wrong to complain so quickly. Because less than an hour later, ready to give up and turn around... we finally discovered something... 

In the middle of the jungle, cutting through a dispersal of sparse trees, was a very thin and narrow outline of sorts... It was some kind of pathway... A trail... We had found it! Covered in thick vegetation, our group had almost walked completely by it – and if it wasn’t for Hayley, stopping to tie her shoelaces, we may still have been searching. Clearly no one had walked this pathway for a very long time, and for what reason, we did not know. But we did it! We had found the trail – and all we needed to do now was follow wherever it led us. 

I’m not even sure who was the happier to have found the trail: Aaron and his colleagues, who reacted as though they made an archaeological discovery - or us, just relieved this entire day was not for nothing. Anxious to continue along the trail before it got dark, we still had to wait patiently for Aaron’s team. But because they were so busy filming their documentary, it quickly became too late in the day to continue. The sun in Vietnam usually sets around 6 pm, but in the interior of the forest, it sets a lot sooner. 

Making camp that night, we all pitched our separate tents. I actually didn’t own a tent, but Hayley suggested we bunk together, like we were having our very own sleepover – which meant Brodie rather unwillingly had to sleep with Chris. Although the night brought a boatload of bugs and strange noises, Tyler sparked up a campfire for us to make some s'mores and tell a few scary stories. I never really liked scary stories, and that night, although I was having a lot of fun, I really didn’t care for the stories Aaron had to tell. Knowing I was from Utah, Aaron intentionally told the story of Skinwalker Ranch – and now I had more than one reason not to go back home.  

There were some stories shared that night I did enjoy - particularly the ones told by Tyler. Having travelled all over the world, Tyler acquired many adventures he was just itching to tell. For instance, when he was backpacking through the Bolivian Amazon a few years ago, a boat had pulled up by the side of the river. Five rather shady men jump out, and one of them walks right up to Tyler, holding a jar containing some kind of drink, and a dozen dead snakes inside! This man offered the drink to Tyler, and when he asked what the drink was, the man replied it was only vodka, and that the dead snakes were just for flavour. Rather foolishly, Tyler accepted the drink – where only half an hour later, he was throbbing white foam from the mouth. Thinking he had just been poisoned and was on the verge of death, the local guide in his group tells him, ‘No worry Señor. It just snake poison. You probably drink too much.’ Well, the reason this stranger offered the drink to Tyler was because, funnily enough, if you drink vodka containing a little bit of snake venom, your body will eventually become immune to snake bites over time. Of all the stories Tyler told me - both the funny and idiotic, that one was definitely my favourite! 

Feeling exhausted from a long day of tropical hiking, I called it an early night – that and... most of the group were smoking (you know what). Isn’t the middle of the jungle the last place you should be doing that? Maybe that’s how all those soldiers saw what they saw. There were no creatures here. They were just stoned... and not from rock-throwing apes. 

One minor criticism I have with Vietnam – aside from all the garbage, mosquitos and other vermin, was that the nights were so hot I always found it incredibly hard to sleep. The heat was very intense that night, and even though I didn’t believe there were any monsters in this jungle - when you sleep in the jungle in complete darkness, hearing all kinds of sounds, it’s definitely enough to keep you awake.  

Early that next morning, I get out of mine and Hayley’s tent to stretch my legs. I was the only one up for the time being, and in the early hours of the jungle’s dim daylight, I felt completely relaxed and at peace – very Zen, as some may say. Since I was the only one up, I thought it would be nice to make breakfast for everyone – and so, going over to find what food I could rummage out from one of the backpacks... I suddenly get this strange feeling I’m being watched... Listening to my instincts, I turn up from the backpack, and what I see in my line of sight, standing as clear as day in the middle of the jungle... I see another person... 

It was a young man... no older than myself. He was wearing pieces of torn, olive-green jungle clothing, camouflaged as green as the forest around him. Although he was too far away for me to make out his face, I saw on his left side was some kind of black charcoal substance, trickling down his left shoulder. Once my tired eyes better adjust on this stranger, standing only 50 feet away from me... I realize what the dark substance is... It was a horrific burn mark. Like he’d been badly scorched! What’s worse, I then noticed on the scorched side of his head, where his ear should have been... it was... It was hollow.  

Although I hadn’t picked up on it at first, I then realized his tattered green clothes... They were not just jungle clothes... The clothes he was wearing... It was the same colour of green American soldiers wore in Vietnam... All the way back in the 60s. 

Telling myself I must be seeing things, I try and snap myself out of it. I rub my eyes extremely hard, and I even look away and back at him, assuming he would just disappear... But there he still was, staring at me... and not knowing what to do, or even what to say, I just continue to stare back at him... Before he says to me – words I will never forget... The young man says to me, in clear audible words...  

‘Careful Miss... Charlie’s everywhere...’ 

Only seconds after he said these words to me, in the blink of an eye - almost as soon as he appeared... the young man was gone... What just happened? What - did I hallucinate? Was I just dreaming? There was no possible way I could have seen what I saw... He was like a... ghost... Once it happened, I remember feeling completely numb all over my body. I couldn’t feel my legs or the ends of my fingers. I felt like I wanted to cry... But not because I was scared, but... because I suddenly felt sad... and I didn’t really know why.  

For the last few years, I learned not to believe something unless you see it with your own eyes. But I didn’t even know what it was I saw. Although my first instinct was to tell someone, once the others were out of their tents... I chose to keep what happened to myself. I just didn’t want to face the ridicule – for the others to look at me like I was insane. I didn’t even tell Aaron or Sophie, and they believed every fairy-tale under the sun. 

But I think everyone knew something was up with me. I mean, I was shaking. I couldn’t even finish my breakfast. Hayley said I looked extremely pale and wondered if I was sick. Although I was in good health – physically anyway, Hayley and the others were worried. I really mustn’t have looked good, because fearing I may have contracted something from a mosquito bite, they were willing to ditch the expedition and take me back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. Touched by how much they were looking out for me, I insisted I was fine and that it wasn’t anything more than a stomach bug. 

After breakfast that morning, we pack up our tents and continue to follow along the trail. Everything was the usual as the day before. We kept following the trail and occasionally stopped to document and film. Even though I convinced myself that what I saw must have been a hallucination, I could not stop replaying the words in my head... “Careful miss... Charlie’s everywhere.” There it was again... Charlie... Who is Charlie?... Feeling like I needed to know, I ask Chris what he meant by “Keep a lookout for Charlie”? Chris said in the Vietnam War movies he’d watched, that’s what the American soldiers always called the enemy... 

What if I wasn’t hallucinating after all? Maybe what I saw really was a ghost... The ghost of an American soldier who died in the war – and believing the enemy was still lurking in the jungle somewhere, he was trying to warn me... But what if he wasn’t? What if tourists really were vanishing here - and there was some truth to the legends? What if it wasn’t “Charlie” the young man was warning me of? Maybe what he meant by Charlie... was something entirely different... Even as I contemplated all this, there was still a part of me that chose not to believe it – that somehow, the jungle was playing tricks on me. I had always been a superstitious person – that's what happens when you grow up in the church... But why was it so hard for me to believe I saw a ghost? I finally had evidence of the supernatural right in front of me... and I was choosing not to believe it... What was it Sophie said? “If you see something. No you didn’t. If you hear something... No you didn’t.” 

Even so... the event that morning was still enough to spook me. Spook me enough that I was willing to heed the figment of my imagination’s warning. Keeping in mind that tourists may well have gone missing here, I made sure to stay directly on the trail at all times – as though if I wondered out into the forest, I would be taken in an instant. 

What didn’t help with this anxiety was that Tyler, Chris and Brodie, quickly becoming bored of all the stopping and starting, suddenly pull out a football and start throwing it around amongst the jungle – zigzagging through the trees as though the trees were line-backers. They ask me and Hayley to play with them - but with the words of caution, given to me that morning still fresh in my mind, I politely decline the offer and remain firmly on the trail. Although I still wasn’t over what happened, constantly replaying the words like a broken record in my head, thankfully, it seemed as though for the rest of the day, nothing remotely as exciting was going to happen. But unfortunately... or more tragically... something did...  

By mid-afternoon, we had made progress further along the trail. The heat during the day was intense, but luckily by now, the skies above had blessed us with momentous rain. Seeping through the trees, we were spared from being soaked, and instead given a light shower to keep us cool. Yet again, Aaron and his crew stopped to film, and while they did, Tyler brought out the very same football and the three guys were back to playing their games. I cannot tell you how many times someone hurled the ball through the forest only to hit a tree-line-backer, whereafter they had to go forage for the it amongst the tropic floor. Now finding a clearing off-trail in which to play, Chris runs far ahead in anticipation of receiving the ball. I can still remember him shouting, ‘Brodie, hit me up! Hit me!’ Brodie hurls the ball long and hard in Chris’ direction, and facing the ball, all the while running further along the clearing, Chris stretches, catches the ball and... he just vanishes...  

One minute he was there, then the other, he was gone... Tyler and Brodie call out to him, but Chris doesn’t answer. Me and Hayley leave the trail towards them to see what’s happened - when suddenly we hear Tyler scream, ‘CHRIS!’... The sound of that initial scream still haunts me - because when we catch up to Brodie and Tyler, standing over something down in the clearing... we realize what has happened... 

What Tyler and Brodie were standing over was a hole. A 6-feet deep hole in the ground... and in that hole, was Chris. But we didn’t just find Chris trapped inside of the hole, because... It wasn’t just a hole. It wasn’t just a trap... It was a death trap... Chris was dead.  

In the hole with him was what had to be at least a dozen, long and sharp, rust-eaten metal spikes... We didn’t even know if he was still alive at first, because he had landed face-down... Face-down on the spikes... They were protruding from different parts of him. One had gone straight through his wrist – another out of his leg, and one straight through the right of his ribcage. Honestly, he... Chris looked like he was crucified... Crucified face-down. 

Once the initial shock had worn off, Tyler and Brodie climb very quickly but carefully down into the hole, trying to push their way through the metal spikes that repelled them from getting to Chris. But by the time they do, it didn’t take long for them or us to realize Chris wasn’t breathing... One of the spikes had gone through his throat... For as long as I live, I will never be able to forget that image – of looking down into the hole, and seeing Chris’ lifeless, impaled body, just lying there on top of those spikes... It looked like someone had toppled over an idol... An idol of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ... when he was on the cross. 

What made this whole situation far worse, was that when Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles catch up to us, instead of being grieved or even shocked, Miles leans over the trap hole and instantly begins to film. Tyler and Brodie, upon seeing this were furious! Carelessly clawing their way out the hole, they yell and scream after him.  

‘What the hell do you think you're doing?!’ 

‘Put the fucking camera away! That’s our friend!’ 

Climbing back onto the surface, Tyler and Brodie try to grab Miles’ camera from him, and when he wouldn’t let go, Tyler aggressively rips it from his hands. Coming to Miles’ aid, Aaron shouts back at them, ‘Leave him alone! This is a documentary!’ Without even a second thought, Brodie hits Aaron square in the face, breaking his glasses and knocking him down. Even though we were both still in extreme shock, hyperventilating over what just happened minutes earlier, me and Hayley try our best to keep the peace – Hayley dragging Brodie away, while I basically throw myself in front of Tyler.  

Once all of the commotion had died down, Tyler announces to everyone, ‘That’s it! We’re getting out of here!’ and by we, he meant the four of us. Grabbing me protectively by the arm, Tyler pulls me away with him while Brodie takes Hayley, and we all head back towards the trail in the direction we came.  

Thinking I would never see Sophie or the others again, I then hear behind us, ‘If you insist on going back, just watch out for mines.’ 

...Mines?  

Stopping in our tracks, Brodie and Tyler turn to ask what the heck Aaron is talking about. ‘16% of Vietnam is still contaminated by landmines and other explosives. 600,000 at least. They could literally be anywhere.’ Even with a potentially broken nose, Aaron could not help himself when it came to educating and patronizing others.  

‘And you’re only telling us this now?!’ said Tyler. ‘We’re in the middle of the Fucking jungle! Why the hell didn’t you say something before?!’ 

‘Would you have come with us if we did? Besides, who comes to Vietnam and doesn’t fact-check all the dangers?! I thought you were travellers!’ 

It goes without saying, but we headed back without them. For Tyler, Brodie and even Hayley, their feeling was if those four maniacs wanted to keep risking their lives for a stupid documentary, they could. We were getting out of here – and once we did, we would go straight to the authorities, so they could find and retrieve Chris’ body. We had to leave him there. We had to leave him inside the trap - but we made sure he was fully covered and no scavengers could get to him. Once we did that, we were out of there.  

As much as we regretted this whole journey, we knew the worst of everything was probably behind us, and that we couldn’t take any responsibility for anything that happened to Aaron’s team... But I regret not asking Sophie to come with us – not making her come with us... Sophie was a good person. She didn’t deserve to be caught up in all of this... None of us did. 

Hurriedly making our way back along the trail, I couldn’t help but put the pieces together... In the same day an apparition warned me of the jungle’s surrounding dangers, Chris tragically and unexpectedly fell to his death... Is that what the soldier’s ghost was trying to tell me? Is that what he meant by Charlie? He wasn’t warning me of the enemy... He was trying to warn me of the relics they had left... Aaron said there were still 600,000 explosives left in Vietnam from the war. Was it possible there were still traps left here too?... I didn’t know... But what I did know was, although I chose to not believe what I saw that morning – that it was just a hallucination... I still heeded the apparition’s warning, never once straying off the trail... and it more than likely saved my life... 

Then I remembered why we came here... We came here to find what happened to the missing tourists... Did they meet the same fate as Chris? Is that what really happened? They either stepped on a hidden landmine or fell to their deaths? Was that the cause of the whole mystery? 

The following day, we finally made our way out of the jungle and back to Biển Hứa Hẹn. We told the authorities what happened and a full search and rescue was undertaken to find Aaron’s team. A bomb disposal unit was also sent out to find any further traps or explosives. Although they did find at least a dozen landmines and one further trap... what they didn’t find was any evidence whatsoever for the missing tourists... No bodies. No clothing or any other personal items... As far as they were concerned, we were the first people to trek through that jungle for a very long time...  

But there’s something else... The rescue team, who went out to save Aaron, Sophie, Steve and Miles from an awful fate... They never found them... They never found anything... Whatever the Vietnam Triangle was... It had claimed them... To this day, I still can’t help but feel an overwhelming guilt... that we safely found our way out of there... and they never did. 

I don’t know what happened to the missing tourists. I don’t know what happened to Sophie, Aaron and the others - and I don’t know if there really are creatures lurking deep within the jungles of Vietnam... And although I was left traumatized, forever haunted by the experience... whatever it was I saw in that jungle... I choose to believe it saved my life... And for that reason, I have fully renewed my faith. 

To this day, I’m still teaching English as a second language. I’m still travelling the world, making my way through one continent before moving onto the next... But for as long as I live, I will forever keep this testimony... Never again will I ever step inside of a jungle... 

...Never again.
