I was 24, going on 25, and I stayed in a college town named Cedar Falls, where I was attending the University of Northern Iowa. I needed a job and a place to live, since Summer break was coming up fast. My friend was moving out of his job as a funeral assistant for a funeral home there. He lived in the basement apartment, and when I visited him before, I remembered the odd chill in the air that never really left. But it was free housing, and the job was open. So I took it.

Only, when I moved in, I discovered I wouldn’t be living in the basement like he had. There was an upstairs apartment above the main part of the funeral home. It was one bed and one bath. It was pretty cozy, actually.

My first night, a friend came by to help me unpack. We were talking, folding clothes, setting up the kitchen, when we both heard a woman's voice coming through the walls. Like someone murmuring just out of earshot.

Trying to be logical, I figured maybe the funeral directors were meeting with someone after hours and their voices carried through a vent or pipe. But it kept happening. And soon, it wasn’t just voices.

Footsteps in the kitchen late at night. Slow, deliberate steps across linoleum.

Then the thermostat began changing on its own. I’d wake up drenched in sweat, finding it cranked to full heat. That happened more than once.

About a month in, it escalated. One night, I heard a single loud knock on my bedroom door. There was no one there. Shadows moved up the walls out of nowhere. My TV started turning itself on in the middle of the night.

And then came the sleep paralysis.

It was the first and only time in my life I experienced it.

I woke up and couldn’t move. My eyes were open but my body refused to obey. I could feel something was standing just to the right of the bed, watching. I couldn’t see anything. But I knew it was there. Then came the vision. It wasn’t a dream. It was as if someone turned on a projector behind my eyes. I saw a staff photo. A Black woman with glasses stood among other funeral home workers. I didn’t recognize her, but I felt her. And then I heard a voice casually mentioning something about a tub. 

In my mind, I asked the presence:
"How much longer until I can move?"

And it LITERALLY began to count down.

Five… four… three… two… one.

I was free. I sat up, drenched in sweat, heart pounding, and immediately messaged the same friend who’d been there on that first night. He’d had his own weird experiences in the apartment, too. I told him everything that had just happened to me. He believed me. 

After that night, everything changed. It was like the haunting flipped off like a switch. The heat stopped shifting, the footsteps stopped. The shadows settled. The air felt normal again.

It was peaceful. Almost protective.

I started calling the ghost Tabitha.

I finally asked my bosses (half-joking) if they'd ever experienced anything paranormal there. They just smiled and said, "A funeral home is the safest place to be. The dead don’t bother anyone." Then they told me I probably needed more sleep.

Maybe they were right.

But maybe they were just afraid to admit it.

I quit about a month later. The experience had shaken me more than I admitted at the time. But I’ve never forgotten it. Never experienced anything like it since.

I kinda miss Tabitha, to be honest with you.
