Hey, I’d love it if you read my creepypasta. At first, it’s a bit boring, but that’s how the story builds up, and I think it gets really good.

Enjoy reading!

My name is Eitan, and I work in a watchtower deep in the forest. The tower was built in 1947, after World War II, to spot fires and other things in the forest. I can't believe this tower hasn’t collapsed or fallen apart—it’s over 1,000 years old.

Anyway, I got a new shift, but this time, it was a night shift. I usually work from 9 AM to 8 PM, and then the guy who takes the night shifts replaces me, but this time, it was my turn.

Let me explain. Recently, a lot of the people who took the night shift quit. There’s a rumor that they saw something between the trees, but I didn’t believe it. Anyway, there weren’t many people left, so they sent me.

I started walking toward the tower. As I walked, it started getting dark, so I hurried because I didn’t want to walk in the dark. Finally, I arrived at the old, rusty tower, and I knew I would have to spend the next 10 hours there. I climbed up the stairs, and I swear it felt like an eternity, but eventually, I reached the top. I grabbed my keys and opened the door.

Inside, there was a bed, a small kitchenette, and a large table filled with devices I didn’t know how to use. I scanned the room and figured out what the devices did. After that, I had to wait for my boss, George, to give me instructions over the radio. And then it came.

**George:** Eitan, can you hear me?

**Eitan:** Yes, I hear you.

**George:** Okay, I’m going to guide you now and tell you what you need to do.

**Eitan:** Okay.

**George:** You’ll need to go out onto the small balcony that surrounds the little room you’re in. Do you see it?

**Eitan:** Yes, I’m heading there now.

**George:** Okay, do you see the binoculars and chairs on the balcony?

**Eitan:** Yes.

**George:** What you need to do is use the binoculars and look out at the forest to see if anything unusual is happening, like smoke, fire, or anything out of the ordinary.

**Eitan:** Okay, and if I see something, what should I do?

**George:** There are various devices in the room. I assume you’ve read what they do.

**Eitan:** Yes, I’ve read about them.

**George:** Alright, just stay on top of things. If there’s an issue, contact me. I’m available.

**Eitan:** Okay.

I said that, and then the radio went silent. The heavy silence of the forest surrounded the small room. I went out onto the balcony. The air was cold and strange, filling my lungs with a suffocating feeling. I looked around through the binoculars, following George’s instructions, but something felt off.

The forest, which should have been quiet and peaceful, started making faint but unsettling noises—rustling leaves with no apparent cause, distant sounds like dragging metal, and even what sounded like light footsteps between the trees. I aimed the binoculars toward the noise, but saw nothing but the long shadows of the night.

Then, I noticed something moving. A figure stood between the trees, distant but clear through the binoculars. It didn’t move, just stood there, staring straight at me. My breath caught in my throat.

I reached for the radio, trying to contact George. “George?” I whispered, but all I heard was static. When I looked back through the binoculars, the figure was gone. I told myself I was just imagining things, maybe due to all the beers I’d had.

An hour passed, and I kept staring at the forest, looking for a fire or something to keep myself busy, but nothing happened. I decided to make myself a toast and something hot to drink. I plugged in the toaster and set the kettle to boil, but after ten seconds, *boom!*—the power went out. It freaked me out, and when I tried to flip the switch, nothing happened.

Great, I thought, it’s no surprise the power’s out in this old, crappy tower. It barely works anyway. I was frustrated, but I had no choice. I went outside with my binoculars and flashlight, attaching the flashlight to the binoculars so the light would follow wherever I was looking.

I sat there for what must’ve been at least two hours, and still saw nothing. But after about half an hour, I noticed a thin streak of smoke in the distance. I tracked it, but everything was dark. After ten minutes of keeping an eye on it, I checked if it was really smoke and whether it was developing into something serious.

I followed the trail down, and what I saw there...

Oh God, help me!

There were things that looked like people, but not quite people—like a mix of trolls or goblins. It was hard to make out exactly, everything was blurry and dark, but I’m sure I saw them.

I went back inside, trying to turn on the device that communicates with the other watchers, but then I remembered the power was out. I tried the radio to contact George, but he wasn’t available.

Then I tried my last resort—the guy who takes over for me in the morning.

I wrote him, and luckily, he was awake.

**Eitan:** Dude, there’s something weird in the forest. There are non-human creatures out here. Please, call someone, I’m begging you.

**Morning Guard:** Dude, non-human creatures? I don’t believe you. Take a picture.

**Eitan:** I’m taking one now, wait.

I opened the camera on my phone, and without realizing it, I had the flash on. I took the picture, then went to check if it was clear. But in the photo, all the creatures were staring directly at me. I lowered my gaze from the phone, and they were all looking at me. Without realizing it, I saw what was causing the smoke—my boss was there, and they... they were roasting him. That’s why he wasn’t available.

And without me noticing, I saw one of them starting to walk toward me.

This thing was huge, and it wasn’t human. I couldn’t think straight, and it was already at the base of the tower.

I ran straight to hide under my bed. A few seconds of silence passed.

Then I heard the door to the small room I was in slowly creak open.

About ten seconds of silence passed, and from under the bed, I saw its massive legs. Its breathing was so deep and heavy, and after a few seconds, I heard it move again. I crawled out from under the bed and ran out of the tower, trying to escape.

I ran, and suddenly, from the second balcony, I saw it. Its face was grotesque, its eyes were black, and worst of all, its face was covered in blood. So much blood. I heard it notice me. I ran as fast as I could down the tower and hid in a restroom downstairs—it was a small, isolated stall.

I just wanted to die at that moment. I saw its shadow peek through the door. After about 10 minutes, I heard it walking away. I came out of the stall and ran like I’ve never run before.

Next time you’re in the forest, remember what I said—those creatures are still out there, and who knows? You might be their next victim.
