Temptation

He could resist everything except temptation, and this was very tempting. His eyes stuck on the computer screen – his face lighting up as he scrolled further and further fuelled by his desire and temptation. Scrolling – scrolling he felt as though he was in a trance, hypnotised by the mere glow of the screen. “Ping” the computer illuminated his face as it rung out with a notification. Excitement filled his body, now was his chance. Darting off his chair, he grabbed his coat and danced around the piles of rubbish taking up majority of the population in his room. Leaving the house with a puffed out chest, he felt rather smug – he was probably the only one able to hide his obsession this long- the obsession that consumed his whole being like another entity living within him. Laughing to himself he felt only prouder, not one person realized – not one!

“Theron!” a door cracked open, “I’m coming in!” A lady walked into a bedroom – clothes were strung across the floor and empty food packets littered every surface. She appeared peeved at something, maybe it was because he went out without saying anything or maybe she was simply annoyed he left his computer running? Practically stomping over to his desk she switched the power button to red and the picture of a teen girl, who had once taken centre of the screen, flickered off.  Watching. He loved watching her – the way she swayed her hips when dancing, the way she sung, the way she showered, the way she cried and screamed. Just everything – he loved everything about her and she didn’t even know his name. The temptation was consuming him; he couldn’t just watch anymore, it wasn’t enough – he needed to talk to her – to have her.   The last ounces of restraint left him – taking away all reason left. He made his move.  Sitting down watching the news, a picture of a girl appeared on the screen along with bold writing stating “Home abduction”.  

He smirked to himself, he had given into temptation once again.

The visitor

Someone’s following me, I know they are. I can see their shadow in the bushes – feel their breath on my neck. My feet slam the ground, faster- I must walk faster. One step, two step until I’m running; my brain is foggy and I’m being suffocated by the air. The trees are swallowing me, their shadows engulfing me like I’m no more than a mouse being killed by a cat. My house is right in front of me, if I could just reach the door handle. Falling to my knees as someone pulls me back, I stay on the floor and scream - scream for anyone to help me, to save me from whatever this was. Laughter from behind me, laughing as if this is the funniest thing they’ve seen; I swiftly turn around...

Nothing.

Nothing is there, just a leaf being blown across the pavement by the wind. Where did they go? Someone was there, I’m sure of it, but where were they? Rushing into my house (my sanctuary) I try to calm my racing heart; anyone would think I’ve ran a marathon with how much I was panting. Eventually I calm, taking in my surroundings, maybe no one was really there? Maybe I’m losing my mind, going crazy.  My throat is dry – am I going crazy? Will they lock me up with all the psychos? I’m not a psycho?! I feel faint, I need water. Splashing the water from the basin onto my face, I immediately feel calmer and more grounded. Staring into the eyes of my reflection, I realize how tired I look, my eyes are red and bags are forming under my eyes. To any other person I probably seem as though I’m a mad person as if I have indeed lost my mind. Turning to leave the room, I wave my reflection goodnight and turn off the light covering the room in a thick blanket.  Frozen, my feet are frozen, I can’t move. What does it mean when you can’t focus on anything? When your thoughts are so quiet but yet so loud? So quiet that not even a spider could crawl and I wouldn’t notice, so loud I could hear my heart thumping against my chest. I slam my hands on the light switch, the light immediately illuminating the room in its glow. Inspecting every inch of the room, I’m free of anxiety once again. Of course, no one was there – no one was ever there but I can never shake the feeling that there is. There’s always a “visitor”, whenever I go to sleep, I feel someone there. Whenever I leave my house, I always think someone’s following me, but there never is. It’s all in my head – the only visitor is the one my mind conjures up.

Paranoia – the thinking and feeling you are being threatened in some way even if there is a little or no evidence to prove it, these thoughts can sometimes be called delusions.
