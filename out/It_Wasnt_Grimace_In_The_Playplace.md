I'm an anxious father. I never denied it and yes, it did tick off my wife and ruin my daughters’ good time on occasion.

But I was right about the playplace at our local McDonald's. 

Bridal Veil Lake, like any tourist town, has a lot of restaurants but only one of these burger-toy depositories. Vacationers, I guess, don't want to visit the same old chain when they're away from home.

Most patrons, maybe all, at the McDonald's are locals. It's always an eclectic mix of characters. There are people like me - normal, average, with a job and family - and the rest: people that come to the place daily for cheap sustenance and air conditioning.

I hate McDonald's. I hate fast food. I especially hate that my kids seem to talk about nothing else. My wife used to  blame me. By trying to forbid it, I inevitably made it desirable. I don't know if that's true but I can't dispute they always pushed to come - even after the traumatic incident of our first visit. 

They were in the playplace - if you aren't aware, many McDonald's have small indoor playgrounds of suspicious cleanliness. 

Climbing structures form a three story maze of padded levels, sealed in plastic netting to prevent falling. A tube slide connects the top to the bottom. 

I blame my wife - let's call her Zelda - for making me exit the structure and then the playplace room altogether.

“You keep too close,” she said. “You're gonna pass on your anxiety. Is that what you want? What your mother did to you?” 

We were sitting in one of those simple booths designed to be uncomfortable, so customers would eat and not linger. I could see the playplace through an interior window. I didn't answer my wife because the crowd of children inside started screaming and swarmed toward the exit.

I wasn't the only parent to rush over. My youngest daughter - Dana - came out first, her four-year-old body pushing open the heavy door while a throng of kids jostled behind her. Dana seemed calmer than the others, including her six-year-old sister, Kara, who was crying.

“What’s going on?”

Parents scooped up kids. I did the same - one in each arm - and took them back to the booth. A confused looking manager went into the playplace to investigate.

“It was Grimace,” Dana said, while Kara sobbed into Zelda's shoulder. “He's a boy and he was chasing us. And he got the other boy who had a blue shirt.”

I remember Kara looking at me when a man walked out of the bathroom. He saw the empty playplace and that all the kids were with their parents. 

“Cameron!” he called and every parent knew his fear. I went with him into the playplace where a few employees had gathered. The father screamed and searched, jamming his adult body through the structure, looking in every blind spot for his kid. “Cameron!”

There really aren't many places to hide in a playplace. 

“Call the police,” I told the employees. They did and wisely locked and guarded the doors so no one could leave. The father ran all through the restaurant, including the kitchen and woman's bathroom, and they let him. A manager went to review security footage. 

Some patrons complained and protested having to stay put but not me. I would absolutely not let a single one of them out if there was a chance they knew something about my missing child.

The police arrived and took control of the scene. We were asked a few questions. Dana repeated her story about Grimace and the boy in the blue shirt. The father of the boy - Cameron - stared at us when we were allowed to leave.

“That was crazy,” Zelda said. I agreed but didn't say more. As usual, I was angry when something bad happened after being told to “relax” my anxieties. I never said, “told you so,” but she knew that's how I felt.

Zelda comes from a privileged background. When I talk about growing up where I did, in relative poverty, she doesn't understand. Maybe she can't relate or thinks I'm exaggerating when I tell her, “There are bad people in the world. Like really, really bad, evil people. They're never going to find that boy alive.”

Zelda admonished me. “Why would you say something like that? The girls don't need that kind of negativity.”

Another minor argument began and never got resolved because we both fell asleep putting our kids to bed in their respective rooms.

I won't bother you with the struggles and nuances of our relationship. It doesn't matter. 

I was right. She was wrong. We never should have gone back to McDonald's.

But we did. After months of waiting for news about the missing kid and not getting any, Zelda convinced me it must be fine. 

“No news is good news,” she said smugly.

“Some news is too horrible to report,” I countered, but she just rolled her eyes. “If they're in there, then I am too.”

“Fine,” she relented.

And lied apparently. The girls had already gone into the playplace before I'd finished ordering their Happy Meals.

“What the hell?” I accused Zelda.

“What?”

Like a nightmare, the scene unfolded the same. Kids screamed and rushed to the exit. There were more than last time. I couldn't see my girls. I pushed through two other dads and the last of the fleeing children. 

Outside the window, the clouds were so dark. It was supposed to rain and storm - that's one of the reasons we'd come. It's the only indoor playground in town that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars each visit. 

The interior of the playplace looked grim with too many shadows and no one playing. 

“Girls?!” 

Zelda came with a manager who looked ready to throw up. 

“Police are coming. We've locked the doors.” The defeated tone told me they never did find Cameron. 

“Girls!” I shouted louder. “Girls!” I climbed the first level of the structure.

“Daddy,” Dana said, her voice altered by the interior of the tube slide. 

“Dana,” I said, slightly relieved. The feeling was less than brief, however.

“Don’t come in here, daddy,” she said. “Grimace will-”

Another scream and I knew it came from Kara. 

“Daddy,” Dana said again, but pleadingly. 

I ran through the narrow corridors designed for under ten and bashed my head and tripped over stupid obstacles along the path. Cursing, I crawled into the tube slide head first and immediately felt the wrongness of the space.

For one, my ample dad bod slid along too easily, as if sucked through a crazy straw. Two, the ride was longer than possible. I kept winding around the twists and the air became colder as the remnants of ambient light were left behind and above. 

And three, it was too quiet. Even the sound of my short, panicked breaths seemed muted by the darkness ahead.

I lost my sense of direction and place in the world. I could be moving or not. There was nothing to see or feel to know for sure.

I turned on my cell flashlight and found Dana's sweaty, scared little face looking back at me. Neither of us were sliding anymore. 

When I reached for her, she squirmed away. 

“No daddy,” she said, “Grimace got Kara. I have to get her.” She tried to go further down the slide and it only occurred to me then that we should still be moving. The steep angle and gravity said so. Yet, we were stuck.

I grabbed her tiny four-year-old arm and pulled her into my lap. She fought but I wouldn't let go. 

“I will get Kara,” I told her.

“I need to come too,” she said, resisting less, and patting my hand. 

“Why?”

“Grimace is strong,” she said. “and he hides really good from adults.”

I was about to start pushing her back up the slide. Losing one child breaks any father. Losing both is a horror of unknown depths. I couldn't fathom such a calamity. My body took over. I started shoving amidst her protests, and then another pair of feet appeared above.

“Zelda,” I said, “what are you doing?”

She looked like she didn't understand the question.

“Take Dana. I have to get Kara.”

She didn't budge. “I'm coming.”

There would be no argument. I tried anyway but she shut that shit down fast with a simple appeal: “We don't have time for this. Move!”

So all three of us began our descent, me cursing in a volume directly related to our collective apprehension. All of us shivered; the temperature in the tube had dropped. The plastic sides were coated with a thin layer of frost.

I don't know how long we were dragging ourselves before Zelda and I shared the terror in our eyes. 

“This can’t be happening,” she said. “It's a nightmare. We're not really here.” She wrung her hands. “We're not really here.” She closed her eyes. “We're not really here.”

For obvious reasons, Zelda had lost her shit. I struggled hard to get to her. The slide resumed utility when I tried going up. In retrospect, it was like it wanted us not to move or to at least slow us down.

Dana got to her first. She put her hand on top of Zelda's. “It's happening, mommy, and it's okay. But we have to hurry.” The resolve of this kid drew away some of the fear, enough to get us moving again.

The light app on my cell noticeably dimmed. I looked at the screen. Only fifteen percent power remained. I'd charged it to one hundred before coming to McDonald's.

“Zelda,” I said, “my phone is dying. Do you-”

She pulled it from her pocket and passed it over without hesitation. I entered the password - we use the same - and her browser was open. One word had been typed into the search bar: divorce. 

I closed the browser, found the flashlight, and resumed moving with a growing numbness beneath the primal fear surging through my body. I had to save Kara. That's all that mattered now. 

Divorce. 

What a damned place to find out.

With my extreme, often unreasonable levels of anxiety, I'm not an easy person to live with, let alone love. So Zelda wanting to leave wasn't a surprise. More like an unavoidable outcome, sooner than expected, but not shocking. Everyone gets tired of me eventually.

At last, we came to it, the end, but not. What blocked the path of the slide is best described as gelatinous goo, purple, and with a kind of face. More like the suggestion of a face. Imagine a child dragging three of their fingers through a splash of thick paint to make eyes, a mouth, and nothing more. 

At last, we found Grimace. His “face” filled the entire cylinder. 

“Jesus Christ,” Zelda said between hyperventilated breaths.

Dana pointed over my shoulder. “That’s Grimace,” she said. “He ate Kara, and the other boy.” She sounded older than four. 

“Kara,” I said, “is in there?” I didn't know what “in there” meant. Beyond there? Inside there? Inside it? “What… the… fuck…” This can’t be happening. Zelda's mantra threatened to burst from my lips. 

We were in a fucking, stupid McDonald's playplace. What the fuck was this? And where were we? 

This can’t be happening. 

I resisted looking at my soon to be ex, afraid I would lose what little remained of my composure. Dana shivered so hard against my back.

“Kara?” I called.

The mouth parted to reveal only more purple goo within. It was fucking smiling.

I tried to jab my index finger in the air toward it, but my fear made the digit wobble. The gesture looked pathetic. Nevertheless, I spoke. “Give… her back… you…”

From its abyss came the laughter of the damned, a desperate, hopeless ringing that said, “I have nothing to lose.” Sad that I know what that sounds like. 

“Give her back.”

More laughter.

“Give. Her. Back!” I plunged my hands into its face, penetrating with surprising ease. That streak of a smile inverted. I was pleased by its sudden dismay. 

So cold though. I've never felt so cold. 

Zelda and Dana were shouting. I couldn't distinguish their words from one another. 

I had everything to lose. I went head first down the slide, pressing the top of my head into Grimace's visage. With a deep breath, I crawled all the way through, plunging into a dark space lit dully by Zelda's phone.

There were no walls or edges to this void. Yet, Kara's pink, unicorn sock rested on a surface, even if I couldn't see it. I tried to crouch in order to stand up but my head hit something hard. It was like I was still inside the tube slide.

The bottom of Kara's small foot rested at the edge of yet another shadow. Small droplets of dark, purple goo dripped from somewhere unseen. I smelled burnt hair before I realized the liquid was acidic. If Kara had been here for long…

In a daze, in pain, I scrambled for her, and grasped her leg, pulling as hard as I could. She emerged as if stuck in the dark. I pulled her small body into my lap and saw the trouble.

In her grasp she held a blue shirt, a child's shirt, and inside the sleeve were the decaying bones of a child. No, not decaying. Digested. Kara had found the missing boy. She had found Cameron, or what was left of him.

I shrieked as I tried to free Kara's fingers from the shirt, but she wouldn't let go. As I shook her forearm, Cameron's remains disintegrated into something like sand. I gave up and clumsily rolled and maneuvered until facing the theoretical interior of Grimace's face.

It looked much the same as the exterior. 

The only difference was that it wasn’t smiling, and it wasn't dismayed. Grimace was pissed. Its facsimile features swirled fiercely and we were spun a few times through the acidic soup trailing from its innards. It burned and I screamed. Kara wasn't conscious but she moaned. 

I dropped Zelda's phone. The light slipped and jostled below where I thought the way was horizontal. The face of Grimace was actually higher than us. 

For a moment, I knew where to place my feet for leverage. I retrieved the phone and squirmed through the burning goo and punched through its cheek. Kara almost slipped from my left arm.

There was nothing on the other side to grab hold of. His suggestion of a face became placidly supreme again. But only for a moment. Strong hands on the other side found mine. Zelda and Dana pulled us through while I writhed to get free.

“Die,” the fucking monster rasped. Its gooey face began to lurch like a bloated snail toward us.

“Quick! Run!” Dana shrieked. Her tiny body fit perfectly in the slide. She could bend her head and brace her shoulders against the top. That allowed her to move upwards pretty fast. Zelda and I, obviously, had less suited proportions. 

“Go!” I shouted at her, shoving Kara into her embrace. She hesitated. I handed her the phone. “Go,” I said with quiet resolve. “It's okay. I get it. It's okay. I know what I have to do.”

“Dear, I-”

I felt its liquid mouth glom onto the heel of my sneaker. “It's okay. Go. I'll see you up there.” Thankfully, she relented and took the only light away. As predicted, “Grimace” slowed down as he began to consume me. I didn't struggle. Frankly, it was a relief to just give up and not have to worry anymore.

“What are you?” I asked.

It answered with its mouth full… of me. “I am exactly what you were afraid of all along, a messenger, here to validate your belief: there are no safe and innocent places. Aren't you happy? You were right. You. Were. Right.”

I had been swallowed up to the waist. The acid interior began to burn, but I didn't scream. If I did, Zelda or the girls or all of them together might come back. 

The pain became unbearable. I started to struggle, which made it chuckle. Getting out proved easier than before. Yet, I only delayed the inevitable. The slimey sound of its ponderous pursuit resumed.

“You could run,” it said, “but you know there's nowhere I can't find you. Or your children. Or maybe your wife.”

“Fuck you.”

It laughed and its gelatinous bile touched again. Quickly, I pulled my feet away and touched the exposed toe bone. The acid had eaten my shoe, sock, and a fair amount of skin.

Panic overcame the exhaustion of my continual anxiety. I crawled away, upward, slowly. The frosted interior warmed and I fell from the mouth of the slide. 

Zelda held my head in her lap. Kara had awakened. While there were reddened marks on her skin, she seemed okay. She was alive more importantly. 

In her hands, she clutched Cameron's blue shirt.

The creature defied rationality. How could the acid consume my shoe and sock but only the bones of the boy? 

Unless… it could control its own digestion. It wanted to save the shirt. Like a serial killer, it wanted a keepsake of the murder, a trophy. 

“What is it? What is it? What is it?”  Someone frantically asked over and over. It wasn’t until I heard Zelda's voice that I realized it was me. I'd finally lost it, and my thoughts departed until something far worse, a greater fear, brought me down to reality.

“You were right, dear,” Zelda said, “there is evil. I should have listened. You. Were. Right.”

And I'd never wanted to be more wrong in my whole entire life. The creature had won. We both believed in it and its residency in the places where children were supposed to play and be safe. 

A cocky teenager went down the slide to prove its safety, to defy my rantings about a monster. He laughed at me when he popped out the other side.

Doctors concluded the injuries I'd received and Kara's were due to extreme friction. They didn't say it, but I believe they thought I had done this to myself and my daughter.

Zelda didn’t file for divorce. 

We didn't go back to McDonald's. 

We never went anywhere unless we had to, and the creature’s power only grew until even necessary places - grocery stores, the doctor, school - became filled with our ceaseless fears of the potential evil that could be there.

If only there'd been no little blue shirt. It existed. We kept it. Did it prove the existence of Grimace? No. But it made it impossible to forget what had happened in the slide.

“Dad,” Dana asked the other day, “can we go outside?”

I stared at her.

Zelda answered. “Honey, no, we talked about this. Your father was right, remember?” She gripped my forearm. “We will never forget: He was right about the [world](https://www.reddit.com/u/APCleriot/s/WmR4hJsRE6).”
