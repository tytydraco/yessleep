When I stepped outside this morning, I noticed one of our “candles” set out past the edge of town, on the outside bank of the creek. We set them out months in advance each year. Six giant wooden poles encompassing the town, taller than the trees.

Tonight, the creatures would come and place the Ravisher’s black ooze on them. Tomorrow, the first “candle” will be lit.

I walked harder than I meant. The previous night’s events still rattled me. The park rose into view out of my periphery. Daylight barely broke an hour before, and Nix already had the entire park roped off with police tape.

Ricky sat just off the tape, his head in his hands. Dirt scuffed beneath my feet as I approached and laid my hand on his shoulder. I felt him shudder.

“Hey Rick.” He sat in silence for a moment, before sniffing. He kept his eyes locked on the ground as he spoke.

“They left the body.”

“What?”

“Jackson, they left him there all night. Walked right over him.”

_Fuck._

My eyes drifted onto the hill behind him, catching an unmistakable red patch stained into the grass.

“I never thought I’d have to…” his voice broke and shoved a lump into my throat. “Ten years old.” I didn’t know what to say.

“That fucking sucks, Ricky.” He dug his blood-stained fingers into his face and wept. I couldn’t imagine what he had gone through. How could you ever prepare for picking a child’s brain out of the grass? A door slammed shut across the road behind me. Ricky looked up.

“Shit,” he said. Tom had blasted out his house doors and took a heavy march right towards us. I stepped out of the way.

“Tom,” Ricky said, standing. Tom continued his walk, his bloodshot eyes fixated behind us. He approached the tape. “Tom,” Ricky said again, stepping between Tom and the tape. Tom planted a heavy hand square into Ricky’s chest and moved him like it was an afterthought. Ricky stumbled as Tom ripped down the tape and walked up the hill.

“Tom, please.” Ricky tried again. I had never heard so much exhaustion in a voice. He knew it was a useless effort. He slumped back onto the bench and clicked his radio.

“Sheriff, I’m still over at the park. It’s Tom.”

“Thanks, Ricky.” Tom collapsed to his knees and wailed. Ricky winced.

“Can you imagine, the whole family—“ Ricky caught himself halfway through. I knew what was coming next. I had seen it for an entire year. This was the part where someone remembers my grief. How close I was to Ethan. To Tom. Amy. Even Jackson. And then that someone contorts their face into that apologetic, guilty look. And all of a sudden, it becomes my job to comfort them.

“Fuck, I’m sorry. Are you doing okay?”

_Absolutely fucking not._

Thankfully, Nix saved me.

“Hey Caleb. Ricky. Let me handle this. Go home. Keep your radio on.” She put a hand on his shoulder as she walked past him. Tom let out another wail.

“You eaten?” I asked him.

Ricky slumped into the booth, the aroma of bacon and black coffee filling up my nose. Zoey, the owner’s daughter, promptly approached us with a fresh pot and poured two cups.

“The usual, for both of us. Thanks, Zoey.” She smiled and left. Zoey was about thirty years old and had been helping her grandmother Hazel here for as long as I can remember. Even though technically the town chooses your job for you when you become of age, everyone knew where she would land. She keeps her chin up, but I don’t think she likes it here. Not that any of us can really know, but she seems like the type who belongs in a city. Sweeping floors and putting pancakes on tables doesn’t suit her.

Ricky gripped his coffee with two hands.

“I don’t think I can do this,” he said, his eyes fixed on the swirling black liquid below him. “The month hasn’t even started yet, and I’m already overwhelmed. Why the fuck did she have to do that?”

My mind flashed to Amy. To Jackson. The sudden crack in my ears. The way his body went limp. The way his limbs landed in awkward positions.

“You will because you have to. Just like the rest of us.” For a moment, I thought I might tell him about my plan. About how I’m going to expose this place to the world. I wanted there to be a comfort in that. That we won’t be unknown and unheard anymore. That maybe I can save us.

But I held my tongue. My eyes flashed over Ricky’s gray deputy uniform. The second those words left my lips, he’d arrest me, and I’d spend the next month in a cell, and everything I have planned would fall apart.

A group of children ran by outside the diner, screaming and laughing, and I wondered which of them I’d never see again after this month. Anger swelled in my chest again, like the night before.

“Did you really hear the heartbeats last night?” Ricky asked. I nodded. “But how? You’re of age.” I stared out the window beside me, remembering the last words I ever got from you, Ethan.

“I don’t know. You didn’t hear them?”

“Of course not.” Ricky’s face had scrunched up into a look of concern. “I need to find out if this has happened to anyone else.” My eyes drifted down. Ricky caught it.

“Caleb…has this happened to anyone else?” I sighed. His eyes widened. I pulled out my phone. My fingers hovered over Ethan’s messages. I didn’t want to do this. I can’t count how many times I’ve read and re-read what I was about to show Ricky. I knew the exchange by heart. But it still felt wrong. Those messages weren’t meant for Ricky. They weren’t meant for the diner. They weren’t meant for daylight. They belonged to my bed, in the dark, sleepless, grief filled nights.

I took a breath.

_I’m sorry, Ethan._

I scrolled up a bit.

“Start here,” I said, sliding the phone to Ricky.

October 31, 2022, 9:55

Ethan: Mom’s nervous

Me: The sacrifice didn’t mark you. Only one more night

Ethan: Yeah

Still on for tomorrow?

Me: A thumbs up emoji

Ethan: Have they started?

Me: Yeah

Ethan: You can hear them?

Me: Yes

Ethan: I can hear them too

Me: How?

Ethan: Idk

It’s getting louder

Caleb

I’m scared

Ricky put the phone on the table and slid it back over to me. I didn’t show him the voicemail or the 14 unanswered calls from the next morning. He stayed silent for a long time, sipping his coffee several times, before finally speaking.

“Does the sheriff know about this?” I shook my head.

Zoey plopped down a series of plates brimming with pancakes and scrambled eggs.

“Hey, Zoey, real quick. Last night. Did you hear the heartbeats?” The confusion in her face gave the answer. Ricky turned back to me. “We need to talk to Nix.”

An hour later, I sat in the sheriff’s office, waiting for Nix to arrive. It was a small office attached to the jail, which was just a small row of cells that, aside from Tom spending a few nights a month in the drunk tank, remained empty all year. 

The room contained a few filing cabinets in the corner kept under lock and key, and a sizable wooden desk in the middle of the room. Missing person posters lined the walls. Each one, a child. Well, almost.

Ever since she took office, Nix made it her policy to never take them down. It was a formality to never close the cases. We all knew nobody would ever see those kids again. But Nix believes in making sure we never fully normalize it. 

My eyes darted through the posters. Most I didn’t know. Some I did. Ethan was the latest addition. They used his ID picture for the poster. I hated it. It wasn’t the real Ethan. I never understood why you couldn’t smile in those pictures. He was always the one to smile. To be happy. To laugh. It was infectious.

It was hard to look at the poster. It was harder not to.

Nix broke my attention when she walked into the room.

“Hey, Caleb,” she said, brushing a stray hair out of her face as she sat down and folded her hands. She looked flustered. “What’s up?”

“Hey Sheriff, I have something I need to show you.” I handed her the phone. Silence ate the room as she read the texts. A minute, or a year, passed before she handed the phone back to me.

“Thank you for sharing that. I’m sure that was very hard.” I clenched my jaw and swallowed as I tucked my phone into my pocket. It was that or cry. “Yesterday, Deputy Yang told me you heard them, too. Is that true?” I nodded. “Well…” she took a long beat. “This concerns me. I’ve never heard of this before.” She sighed and leaned back in her chair. “I promise I’ll look into it. We’re looking into all pattern changes. It’s our highest priority. But for now, we need to begin inspections on the candles.”

“Thanks, Sheriff.” She nodded and attempted a smile before the door clicked behind me.

I wiled away the next few hours back home, waiting for dark. Even from inside my room, I could feel the town buzz with anxiety as night approached. Hours passed, and night finally took the town.

It was time. I looked out my bedroom window at the street below. The Sheriff had come by earlier to issue her “shelter in place” orders to each home. It was a formality. We all knew the rules. Nobody allowed out after dark. Especially this year.

But that meant that the Hub had probably been empty for a couple of hours by now. As good a place as any to watch the evening’s festivities. A few prying eyes and a police department of two people probably wouldn’t be hard to avoid.

I cracked open the bedroom window, and, after a few practiced maneuvers with the aid of a pine tree, landed on the ground on the side of my house. The crisp October air bit my skin.

The dark was heavy and thick. I figured as long as I stayed off Main where our only streetlights are, I should be able to move around without being seen. My breath was catching in my throat. I imagined creatures waiting for me around every corner. Eyes watching me from every house.

I made my way through a few alleys and roads until the Hub was in sight. It sat at the edge of the town, isolated from the rest. A candle waited to be doused in black slime just past its outer edge.

I approached the building, still unable to shake the feeling of eyes on my skin, when I saw a figure standing in the dark. I nearly screamed. It was standing motionless out past the candle. It wasn’t tall enough to be a monster. It faced away from me. I was unseen. I considered myself lucky. I could still make it into the Hub unseen.

_Thump-thump._

_Fuck. They’re here._ 

I walked towards the door of the Hub. A small blue light outlined the square for my badge entry. I looked up at the camera above the door, pointed right at me.

I knew someone would catch me eventually. Cameras, user logins on the computer, badge entries. It was all documented. And I knew I’d probably spend the rest of my life inside that jail just down the road. That’s if they don’t force me to leave.

But, at the very least, I’d be able to get me some time. Cameras, badge entries, user logins. People here only check those when they have a reason to.

_Thump-thump._

I grabbed my badge from my pocket. All I had to do was scan it, wait for the distinctive click of the door, and I was home free. At least for tonight. But I couldn’t ignore the figure in the dark. Whoever it was, it was possible they hadn’t heard the heartbeats.

_God damnit._

I peeked out from around the corner. The figure was still there.

_Fuck._

Anonymity be damned, I guess. The punishment for being out after dark is less than the punishment of letting someone die. Besides, they wouldn’t know I was going to the Hub. I could just come back tomorrow night.

I took a step forward.

“Hey, you out there,” I hollered. No response.

“Hey! It’s getting dark. You can’t be so close to the candles when they—“

The figure’s head whipped around and stared right at me. I jumped, but the figure made no other motion.

I took a few more steps forward, and the silhouette finally became clear. It was Beth. 

_Fuck fuck fuck._

“Jesus _Christ,_ Beth. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing? You need to…” my voice trailed off. I was close enough now to realize she was saying something under her breath. No, not saying something. Chanting something.

“Beth?” I took a few more cautious steps forward. Her voice was low and distorted.

“The contract has been broken.” She locked her eyes on me, but she hadn’t turned her body away from the woods.

“What? Come on, we need to get inside.”

_Thump-thump._

“The contract has been broken.” Her eyes were bloodshot and bulging. I reached forward and grabbed her arm. Her skin was cold.

“Come on. Let’s go.” My eyes darted toward the woods, but I saw only black.

“The contract has been broken.” Her voice was getting louder. “The contract has been broken. The contract has been broken.” Each time she repeated the line, she said it faster. “The contract has been broken.”

My eyes peeked back into the woods. Yellow dots peeked back.

“Okay, fuck, let’s go.” I pulled hard. Her body remained rigid, and she and I fell from the weight of my pull. Dust flared into my eyes and mouth. I coughed. Beth’s body convulsed on the ground, her limbs rigid.

“The contract has been broken.” Shapes took form around the yellow eyes in the darkness as the creatures stepped closer.

_Thump-thump._

I put my hands on Beth’s face and shook her.

“Come on, we have to go right now. We can’t be out past the candles. You know that.” My eyes darted up again. The creatures’ bodies were clearly visible now.

“Beth!” My voice cracked. She was foaming at the mouth as she nearly screamed her words again and again. I could hear the ground scuff. 50 feet at most.

I got behind her and locked my hands under her arms and pulled. Her rigid, shaking body fought back.

“The contract has been broken.”

I pulled as fast as I could. The creatures kept pace. 30 feet. My arms burned from the strain. I glanced behind me. The candle was only 15 feet away. I pulled hard. She felt as though she was getting heavier.

“The contract has been broken.”

I could see the faces of the creatures now. I took one last heave. My feet tangled beneath me, and I toppled backwards, bracing myself on my elbows. The creatures were close enough I could see their eyes. 10 feet. And this time, there was no glass to protect me.

5 feet. 4. 3. I could nearly reach out and touch them. Then they stopped.

_Thump-thump._

They stared at me. They stared at Beth, still convulsing and foaming. I looked to my left. The candle. We had made it. One by one, the creatures formed a curved line just behind it for as far into the night as I could see.

I gulped air hard a few times before turning my attention back to Beth.

“We made it,” I said, getting to my knees beside her.

“The contract has been broken.”

I tried to hold her shoulders down. Beside me, a creature stood next to the candle and posed itself, arms spread, feet together, like Jesus on the cross. I knew what was coming next. Other creatures surrounded it and dug their fingers into its flesh. They clawed at its eyes. They put hands into its mouth. Scratched at its naked belly and throat. Again and again, the other creatures ripped into the sacrifice’s flesh. From its bloated belly gushed a thick, black goo. Still, the creatures continued to pull at the victim’s flesh. Others knelt down to drink the black ooze from the victim.

I had never been close enough to hear the flesh rip before. I had never been close enough to smell it.

“The contract has been broken.”

The creatures slathered the wood in the repulsive, sticky black ooze. Then they did something I’d never seen them do. Something I didn’t even know they could do. A handful of them picked it up. Lifted the entire beam right out of the ground like it weighed nothing at all, and carried it forward. Right towards me.

“Beth!” I shook her body hard. “Beth, come _on,_ wake up. Snap out of it. We have to go.”

“The contract has been broken.” Her mouth foamed and gurgled her words so badly I might not have been able to understand her if I didn’t already know. Tears welled in my eyes. The creatures walked towards me, aiming the massive pointed bottom at me. I looked at the entrance to the Hub. Only a quick dash. I could still make it.

My chest tightened as I realized what I had to do. A few creatures had picked up the mutilated remains of their victim, whose slashed belly still pulsated globs of putrid black slime.

I could hardly get the words out. They were little more than a whisper.

“I’m sorry.”

I picked myself off the ground and found my feet only a step or two before I would have been in arms reach. I scrambled off to the side. Thankfully, whatever the creatures wanted didn’t seem to have much to do with me. I bolted for the door.

My shaking hands fumbled with my badge before the familiar click brought heaven to my ears. I pulled the door shut behind me.

Click.

_Thump-thump._

I waited out the night on the roof, which I accessed through a small ladder on the top floor of the building. To my horror, I watched the creatures converge on the town. They had lifted all six candles from the ground and given them a new home. A circle surrounding the prison.

The creatures left hours before the sunrise, but I told myself I didn’t trust it. That I was afraid. But I knew I was safe when the heartbeats faded. I was too afraid to see what happened to Beth. I imagined her mangled body. Dried foam caked to blue lips. Limbs bent in wrong directions.

I didn’t want to see it. One dead body was bad enough.

The morning light pulled my attention to a mark on my arm I hadn’t noticed in the night. A drop of black ooze stuck to my right arm.

I can’t get it [off.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/16zbwo9/thanks_for_reading/)
