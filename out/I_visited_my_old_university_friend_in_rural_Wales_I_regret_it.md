This took place in the UK, a few months ago now. It remains one of the most unnerving experiences I have ever faced in my 25 years of life. It happened recently, three months ago. 

Me and Edward had been friends since we met at university in Manchester. After we’d graduated in 2021, I moved back to London where I am originally from. Edward however had come from a small

In early December last year, Edward invited me to this house that he was renting since March. I hadn't really contacted him much since we graduated. Aside from a few texts after we'd parted ways, we had slowly fallen apart like most university friends did. But since he was one of my best friends during those four years at university, I agreed to drive down to see him on New Years Day.

It was cold and windy when I pulled into his driveway. The first thing I noticed was that this house was actually in the middle of nowhere. Tarmac roads turned to gravel roads that I got lost on for at least an hour. That should have been a warning sign for what was to come. By the time I reached the house, it was already a bit past 5 and the sun was already setting. I literally couldn't see beyond a few metres, due to the pine trees that grew near the house. My phone also showed very spotty signal.

I thought about turning back, which was weird. I loved forests, but this specific place really unsettled me. But that would be impolite. I knocked.

When Edward answered the door, he looked different. Very different. He looked more tired, maybe even more stressed. His blonde hair was thinner, way thinner than the hair of a healthy man in his mid-20s. We greeted each other, and he told me to come inside. I did. Immediately, the house smelled off. Like something was rotting. The interior was messy.

This was weird, since Edward at uni would *always* take care of himself. He’d keep his room spotless. Maybe he was depressed and stopped taking care of himself? I mean, I hadn’t seen him for years. Who knows what had really happened in his life. So I asked. Edward laughed. He said he didn’t have any time to clean thoroughly. Plus the house was two centuries old, so it was hard to deep-clean it.

We sat in the living room, which was dimly lit by an old brass floor lamp in the corner. A light bulb flickered occasionally, but neither of us really acknowledged it. Edward handed me a beer from a mini-fridge tucked awkwardly beside the fireplace. The fire was on, but it didn’t do much to cut the cold that crept through the wooden beams. The room was filled with drafts, like the house breathed.

We talked for hours. About our uni days, our youthful energy, old friends, the professors we hated, the girl he almost dated in second year. It felt good, almost nostalgic. But the longer we talked, the more I noticed something was… not right. This wasn’t like Edward. He wouldn’t stop glancing at the window. Not in an exactly paranoid way, just casually, like someone who was expecting a package. But there was nothing out there. Just those tall, dark pine trees—dense and unmoving in the dark.

At one point, I asked him what it was like living out here.

He paused. “Quiet,” he said, then added, “Good for thinking.” The silence that followed made me uneasy. I hadn’t heard a single bird since arriving. No wind, no branches tapping the glass. Just the occasional groan of the house. Probably just old wood creaking. The soundproofing was really good.

I glanced at the time. Nearly 10:00 PM.

I walked toward the window, pulling aside the curtain slightly. My breath caught.

The forest outside was now almost completely whited out—snow was falling so hard I could barely see the first few trees. It hadn’t been snowing when I arrived. “Oh Jesus,” I said. “That came out of nowhere.” Edward didn’t even turn around when he did that. He just looked past me, into the white forest. “Yeah. It does that up here.” I stood there, watching the snow spiral away in strange patterns, almost like it was falling *sideways*. There was no noise, no cars, no light anywhere. Completely rural.

I stepped back and rubbed the back of my neck.

“I was meant to drive back tonight,” I said, “Got a Premier Inn booked about an hour down the road.” Edward turned around, finally. “Stay here,” he said. “It’s not safe to drive down the mountain in this.”

*I hadn’t even asked yet.* “A bit quick, no mate?” I asked. Edward didn’t answer. He just insisted. I just thought he really missed me, but I should have picked up on the way that he seemed almost eager…

I jolted awake, heart pounding, but it wasn’t the pounding of a hangover. Something was wrong. My eyes snapped open, and for a moment, I had no idea where I was. The room was still, and the silence was thick—too thick.

I reached for my phone, the only thing that could ground me right now. It was 3:45 AM.

A soft creak, then another. The floorboards downstairs—someone was moving.

I froze.

It wasn’t the wind. The house had been *dead quiet* earlier, and it should still be. My pulse quickened. Was Edward okay?

Then, my phone buzzed.

I unlocked it, and saw a voice note from Edward. I hit play without thinking.

“Hey… just... gone out... bathroom... be right back...” His voice was rough, strained, like he was whispering from deep within his throat. It didn’t sound right. The words were slurred, like he was struggling to speak. And there was something else—something… *off* in the background. A soft, almost imperceptible noise, like a distant hum. A drone.

I stared at the phone screen, my heart sinking. That wasn’t the Edward I knew. His voice—*that wasn’t him*.

I sat up, my body still shaky from the alcohol. The air in the room felt wrong—stale, almost oppressive. Without thinking, I swung my legs off the bed and stood, swaying as I made my way to the door.

My hand hovered over the doorknob, but then it hit me. The door was locked.

I tried to twist the handle. Nothing.

I looked around, and my mind raced. Was I locked in here? Was he trying to keep me in? Or was I just too drunk to remember that I hadn’t locked it myself?

The noise downstairs persisted—shuffling footsteps, muffled voices. My breath quickened. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone in the house. Not just Edward. Something else.

I pressed my ear to the door. The silence was thick again, but then—a sharp *thunk*. The unmistakable sound of something heavy falling. And then, soft, rhythmic tapping.

I backed away from the door, my heart slamming against my ribs.

It wasn’t the sound of a normal person moving around. There was something... *unnatural* about it. A shift in weight that didn’t make sense. I pulled my phone out again, thinking about calling someone, but there was no signal. Not a single bar.

I shook my head, trying to focus. I had to get out. I had to see what was going on.

I backed up against the wall, pressing my hands to my temples as if trying to push the panic away. My mind was clouded from the alcohol, but I knew something was wrong. That noise downstairs was growing louder, closer. The soft tapping, like someone—or something—was pacing.

I couldn’t stay locked in here. Whatever was going on, I had to see it for myself. Slowly, I crept to the window, hoping for a glimpse of something that would make sense, but all I could see was the thick white blur of the snowstorm still raging outside. It was as if the world beyond the walls had disappeared.

I turned back to the door, and my stomach churned. The lock on the door… it wasn’t just a deadbolt. There was something else. Something that made my breath catch in my throat. A thin, almost invisible thread of metal crisscrossed the lock. It was like a *trap*.

I grabbed the door handle again, twisting harder this time, yanking at it with everything I had. But the lock stayed firm, the thread pulling tight like it was made to stop me from leaving.

I swore under my breath, my mind racing for options.

The sound downstairs stopped. The silence was unbearable.

Then, I heard the door at the bottom of the stairs creak open. A faint shuffle of boots against the wooden floor. I held my breath.

“Edward?” I called out, my voice cracking, not recognizing it even as I spoke.

No answer.

I swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing on me. I didn’t know if I was imagining things or if something in the house really had changed, but I *knew*—I wasn’t alone.

I moved back to the window, looking down at the ground outside. The snowstorm made the world feel like it had been frozen in time, but there was something else that stood out to me—footprints. Fresh ones, cutting through the snow, leading towards the forest.

I could feel my heart thumping in my chest, the pull of fear so strong it almost paralyzed me. Should I go outside? But the thought of stepping into that freezing cold, with no guarantee of safety...

I didn’t have time to decide. The sound of footsteps came closer, now unmistakable—a slow, deliberate *creak* of the floorboards from the bottom of the stairs.

And then… Edward’s voice. But it wasn’t like before. It was low. Gravelly. Almost like someone was choking on the words.

“Don’t come down,” he whispered, voice so hoarse it barely registered. “Stay in the room.”

I froze, my hand still gripping the window frame, my skin ice-cold.

“Why?” I called out, my voice betraying the panic I was trying to hold back.

The reply came in a rasp. “Just don’t open the door... Please.”

The sound of feet faded away but not back towards the staircase. But another sound, a weight being dragged came. I just stood there, my pulse hammering in my ears, torn between trusting Edward, or something else... Something unsettling I couldn’t put into words. But the one thing I *knew*—it was no longer just about the storm or the house. It was about Edward. And whatever he was trying to hide.

I hadn’t even noticed the window before, but now I did. The huge window was weirdly boarded up. I walked up to it, the bile in my stomach rising, and yanked on the boards. They didn’t budge. I tried to peek through the boards instead. Anything. There was a narrow gap after all, so I peered through it.

At first, all I saw was the forest. Then, my heart nearly stopped when I saw him. Edward.

He was dragging something huge and oddly smooth object through the snow, barely visible under the glow of the moon. His movements were jerky, unnaturally slow, like he was forcing the weight of whatever it was. The figure he was pulling… was too big. Too heavy. It looked like a lump, something almost too human-like to be fake, its shape obscured by the snow as it scraped against the ground.

But then I noticed—something metallic glinting in the pale light, a flash of steel that caught my eye. Edward had something in his other hand. My eyes widened when I figured out what it was.

A long, gleaming knife. Its blade caught the moonlight as he held it, his grip on it tight and sure.

At that moment, I felt my stomach twist into knots. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t Edward. Not the guy I knew, not the guy I’d just spent hours laughing with and drinking with. I backed away from the window, my mind screaming at me to do something—anything—but fear kept my legs rooted to the floor. My breath came in ragged gasps, my eyes darting around the dimly lit room as if it might give me a clue as to how I could escape.

I was trapped.

But then my eyes landed on something small in the corner—something I hadn’t noticed before in my haze of drunkenness. A loose nail. It was embedded in the wood, sticking out just enough for me to grab it. I wasted no time.

My hands trembled as I approached the door, my mind working through the next step in a desperate haze. I needed to move quickly, to get out of here before whatever was happening to Edward pulled me in, too. With a sharp twist, I unscrewed the nail, the tiny metal groan of it turning in my fingers oddly satisfying against the noise of my beating heart.

I wedged the nail between the lock and the frame, the wood creaking as I worked the nail into place. And I twisted. The key came free.

Then, with a shallow breath, I grabbed a scrap of paper from the table beside me, carefully sliding it under the door. My hands were slick with sweat as I nudged the key from the other side, inching it slowly towards the crack where the paper lay. It felt like an eternity before the key scraped against the paper, and I gently pulled it in. I slipped the key into the lock. The door opened with a soft click.

I was out of the room now. My body felt like lead as I crept through the dark house, my senses on high alert. Every creak of the floorboards beneath my feet sounded like a loud announcement of my presence. I couldn’t hear anything from downstairs. That made it worse. The silence felt suffocating. I was moving quickly now, my heart pounding in my throat. I had to get out. I had to find him. Edward.

But as I approached the staircase, I stopped dead in my tracks.

Edward wasn’t downstairs anymore.

Instead, there was silence. And that *sick* feeling—like I was in danger, even though the house should be empty—settled over me again. Something was happening outside. Something horrible.

The only way out was through the front door.

I stood at the top of the stairs, staring at the darkened hall below. Everything felt still. Too still. I went downstairs. Nothing… nothing… and that’s when I saw it—the door. The door to the basement. It was cracked open just wide enough to invite in a sliver of the dark, musty air from below into the hallway.

My heart hammered in my chest as I realized I hadn’t seen it before. How had I missed it?

Was it always there?

The front door behind me caught my eye.

It was slightly ajar, a thin sliver of moonlight cutting through the gap. The snowstorm outside had intensified, and yet, the chill that swept through the house was not from the wind. It felt… wrong. I took a hesitant step toward the basement door, my senses on edge. The house felt quiet in a way that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand. Something was off. I couldn’t put my finger on it.

I glanced back at the front door, a sudden urge to run pressing against my chest.

Maybe it was all just the excess alcohol, the isolation, the creeping dread of the house itself playing tricks on me. I had to be imagining things. Edward had probably just stepped out for a late walk, or maybe he was just sleeping somewhere else in the house. I could go back to bed, forget about the basement door, forget about the cold draft from the open front door. But then I heard it. A scream.

A woman’s scream.

I don’t think I will ever forget that scream. It was less like a human and more like an animal being stabbed. It was distant, but it cut through the night with a force that made my blood run cold. The sound was muffled, as if someone was trying to stifle it, but there was no mistaking the terror in it.

My heart started to hammer in my chest. What the hell was that? I tried to shake it off, thinking it was just the wind playing tricks on my mind, but no… this was different. It sounded like someone in real danger. My instincts kicked in. I couldn’t just lie in bed and ignore it. That scream was very real. I grabbed my jacket, not bothering to even think about it. My hands shook as I pulled it on, the chill of the wind creeping in. I stepped toward the door, hesitant but driven by something I couldn’t explain.

The snow was not icy like I was expecting it to be. It was soft, sinking quietly beneath my trainers.

I walked towards where Edward had been walking, following his footprints and the rut of the massive object he was dragging. By the looks of the track, it was huge, but almost slender. A deer corpse? No, I would have seen it. Plus, Edward didn’t do any of that hunting stuff. I was pretty sure it’s illegal too.

I knelt down to check it. That’s when my heart dropped again.

A blonde hair strand. It couldn’t belong to any kind of wild animal. It was most definitely… a person. My mouth went dry. I stared at it for what felt like hours. It couldn’t be what I thought it was. It had to be a trick of the moonlight. But I knew deep down that it wasn’t.

I suddenly felt the urge to crouch. I did so, but in the pine trees, where the moonlight didn’t reach. Still, I felt exposed. I could hear voices from the clearing. Then, loud footsteps became clear after around five minutes. He walked by just a few feet away. I didn’t breathe. Not because I was scared he’d hear me—but because I didn’t recognize him anymore. He wasn’t Edward. Not the one I knew. His expression was blank, but focused, like a man on a mission.

Once he passed by me, I sprinted for a few minutes, then walked back down the gravel trail I had driven up from. 

I followed that trail in the darkness with my phone torch, checking over my shoulder. But no one had followed me. Yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that something still was trailing me. At one point, I had to fully stop after I heard something way behind me. 

I reached a police station after 30 minutes, in the town of Porthmadog. It must have been around half-past four. I rang the buzzer on the front door, and it took me around ten minutes before someone finally answered the door, in a very sleepy Welsh accent. I told her everything that had happened. She wasn’t sleepy by the time I was asked to come inside. 

They offered me tea. I couldn’t hold the cup without shaking. The clock above the front desk ticked louder than anything else in the room. Every few minutes, an officer would pass me by, not making eye contact. I think they already knew. At 8:40 PM, a few more police officers had arrived. I finally stood up, thinking I would be going back to confront Edward with them. 

But they told me to come to a room. 

There, I found out that Edward had been arrested. He was staying in a separate station. My car was safe, except for a few scratches. But the most chilling part was that they discovered a woman who had suffered many non-lethal wrist wounds from a knife, a short distance from Edward’s house.

She had been left with the knife, and it was assumed Edward meant it to look like she’d self-harmed. But she had however, barely survived by managing to apply first aid on herself. I couldn’t believe it. My friend Edward was an attempted murderer. 

The police went on to explain that this woman was believed to be a person he had met on a camping trip near Cardiff. 

From their internet history, it seemed she had rejected his advances multiple times. Edward had reportedly 'taken something from her by mistake' when they last met in person, and that was she'd come for Edward to “give it back”. She’d arrived at Edward’s house close to 2 AM, where she had been captured by him and dragged into the house, and subdued. That was what must have woken me up, despite how drunk I was. 

But I couldn’t hear them. The fact that I could have been next was too much. I just straight up asked them then and there, if I could go. They kept me for a few more hours, and then they released me. I saw my car in front of the station. The speed at which I drove back to London should have put me right back in the police station. 

Ten days ago, Edward texted me. Said he was getting charged with attempted murder. I blocked the number without replying. I think part of me wanted to scream at him, but the bigger part just wanted to never hear his voice again. I keep wondering what would’ve happened if I hadn’t woken up. If I hadn’t looked out that window. But then I try not to think about it at all. I just want to forget about what happened, and *who* did it.

I’ve even gotten interview offers from news stations, but I’ve declined. I don’t want to talk about it. Maybe I will in the future. But for now, I'm still trying to process what happened.
