Well, shit.

I was at that stage in life when I found out that my wife had been lying to me throughout our marriage, both about how ruggedly masculine she thought I was, and also about her supernatural powers. That secret had compounded itself upon my discovery that my daughter was also whatever the hell Kimmy had proven to be. [The cherry on top of this shit sundae was meeting the clan’s queen monster bitch as she was about to kill us, finding out that she was secretly my mother-in-law the whole time, and learning that she had been hunting my daughter for years](https://redd.it/145xoik). 

Just an absolute bitch of a Tuesday.

You’d think I was terrified, and you would be correct. My lower digestive tract was churning that warm sushi casserole I’d eaten for lunch into an unholy smoothie of liquid cramps. 

We fear because our survival instinct uses that terror to preserve our species; consequently, the only impulse that overrides self-preservation is fear that your child is in danger.

“Kimmy,” I breathed, “can you please use your weird-ass powers to stop your mother from murdering our child?”

“I would have brought her up to take my place one day.” Charybdis stared at Kimmy as she croaked through her vertical, dripping cloaca of a mouth, stroking a finger along Ella’s cheek. “But your daughter came from *him*, didn’t she?”

Ella, who had fallen asleep despite everything, farted. 

Charybdis shook her head. “The world is better without my granddaughter alive.”

Kimmy leapt past me in a blur as she flew toward her mother. 

I knew that my wife was going to fail before Charybdis had moved. The flash of intimidation on her face told a story of lifelong doubt and inadequacy doled out by a parent who could have changed their child’s world with the slightest gesture of pride. Kimmy knew that she was weaker than her mother, but she was willing to die in the attempt. 

Her doubts proved correct. My wife thrust her arm toward Charybdis just as her mother opened her mouth. A soft, red mist sprayed from Kimmy’s hand before swirling into Charybdis’s open maw, slowing her essence to a gentle trickle of the last few drops at the end of an unnecessary piss.

But the mouth stayed open. Kimmy gasped as her mother inhaled a seemingly endless breath, and I realized with horror that she was sucking my wife’s essence, or spirit, or whatever mystical ghost surrounded and infused her with unnatural abilities. Kimmy fell to her knees, arms flapping uselessly. I understood that I was watching my wife die, and that I was helpless to stop it. I wondered, distantly, if it would be better to go before them so that I didn’t have to watch their end, or to die last and spare them the agony of watching my pain before dying alone.

Charybdis lifted Ella with both hands, silhouetting her against the starry sky, as Kimmy swayed on her knees. The first tickle of fear vomit hit my uvula as I realized that Charybdis was going to swallow my two-year-old whole while my wife crumbled like a desiccated flower. The fang-lined lips of her impossibly mouth grew wider: first the size of a cantaloupe, then a watermelon, as I looked into the shimmering spit that glistened in her wavering darkness. 

If I had learned one thing that night, it’s that I shouldn’t intervene in these moments.

But I didn’t learn anything at all. 

I acted without thinking as Charybdis started lowering Ella feet-first into her mouth. I didn’t know what I was going to do until I saw myself do it. Then I found myself leaping through the air, spinning around to grab Ella like a football as I jumped high as I could. My arms cradled her gentle, sleeping frame while I prepared to crash against the ground.

But I was stuck.

Staring down in bewilderment, I realized what had happened. While jumping to grab Ella from Charybdis’s upraised arms, I’d fallen into her open mouth and was now sitting in it like a chair. Though wide enough to eat a toddler, my 191.3-pound frame was just too large for her to swallow.

But I could feel the fangs. They pressed painfully into my bare flesh: her teeth had clearly shredded my pants, leaving my skin exposed to her mouth and tongue.

I knew that she was going to eat me. And I understood that I was powerless to spare Ella from the same fate. 

I wondered if it was going to hurt, and whether strangling my daughter would be kinder that letting her find a new definition of pain and suffering as we were slowly digested over a thousand years.

It was too much. My stomach lurched with dread.

“mmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!” Charybdis wailed. 

It took a moment to realize that I had just shit into her open throat.

And I was still shitting. 

My ass muffled her scream as she tried to lift me off her mouth. A sucking sensation told me that the same ability she was using to pull Kimmy’s essence was still at full throttle and draining the sushi slurry out of my colon. With a disgusting slurping sound, she popped me away from her lips and launched me into the night sky.

I knew the landing was going to hurt like hell, and I was right. Shock waves of pain bounced through my knees, elbows and ribs as I crashed to the ground and rolled while holding Ella at just enough of a distance to prevent her from getting hurt. I came to a stop next to Kimmy. My adrenaline was enough to keep the pain at a distance as I looked into my wife’s eyes.

My heart sang when her lids fluttered open, green irises slowly coming back into awareness. 

She focused, recognized me, and lurched forward. “Ella!”

We looked down to see her unscathed in my arms, breathing gently, still fast asleep. 

“Oh thank God,” Kimmy breathed, pressing her cheek against our daughter’s face. “I was certain that something horrible was about to hap-”

A sound like a wet sponge tearing caused our heads to snap up and see Charybdis staggering between our cars. Her stomach had burst open like a more disgusting version of her mouth. 

With a *splorch*, a misty ocean of foul, pungent, dark liquid sprayed across every living thing in a thirty-foot radius, and Charybdis fell down dead. 

*

I would have expected Kimmy to be more broken up about her mother’s death. The fact that Charybdis was such a horrible person must have made the process much easier. 

We decided to raise Ella to understand and appreciate who she is. I’m still struggling to learn about my family, and to forgive Kimmy for lying to me for so long. But being human is a work in progress, so I suppose the same holds for whatever Kimmy is. 

“I’ve wanted to – well – *experiment* with my abilities for a *very* long time, Russ,” she breathed as we laid Ella into her crib.” She glanced up at me with bright green eyes and bit her lip. “I can’t tell you how often I’ve fantasized about it, and how badly I wanted you to join me.” Her faced flushed. 

I smiled as she looked down at Ella’s sleeping form. “You’re sure that it’s safe? Can using your… abilities on a person hurt them?”

She shook her head, ponytail bobbing cutely behind her. “I promise that it won’t cause any damage. Plus, we’re keeping things confined to the bedroom.” 

I arched an eyebrow at her. She returned the gesture.

“Ready?”

I grinned.

Then Kimmy reached over and tapped Ella. She instantly rolled into a deep sleep. “She’ll be out for hours,” my wife squeaked, barely hiding her glee.

I took her hand and pulled her to our bedroom. We giggled as we crawled under the covers. 

It was 8:00 p. m., and we were both asleep within ten seconds of entering the room. For the first time in her life, Ella didn’t wake us up once. 

My wife is amazing.
