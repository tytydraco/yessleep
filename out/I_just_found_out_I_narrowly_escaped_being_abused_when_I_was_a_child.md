**TW - Child SA (nothing discussed in detail)**

I am not sure why I am writing or posting this, but I feel so shaken by this experience, I thought writing it out might be therapeutic. I should give a content warning that this story discusses the subject of child sex abuse, though no detail provided.

A few weeks ago, I was watching the news and one of the stories reported that a teacher from a prominent private school had just been convicted on multiple accounts of child sex abuse, the victims including his children as well as students. The report of his arrest and allegations had been suppressed until the trial was over, however was now being made public. The reporter also referenced that the defence lawyers argued for a reduced sentence on the basis that the teacher had also been sexually abused by his father when he was a child. When the name and photo of the teacher was shown, I almost choked. It was Cameron, who one of my best friends from primary school. 

I couldn’t believe it. In primary school, I was best friends with 2 other boys (Cameron and Wilson). We finished primary school in 1995 and whilst they were both sent to the same high school, I was sent to a different school and we therefore lost touch after that. We would often sleep over at each others’ houses, either the three of us or just two of us, and I started to recall memories I had hitherto completely forgotten, all involving Cameron’s father. I really don’t remember things clearly, but I remembered different incidents at various sleep over nights at Cameron’s house. Cameron and I would be changing into our PJ’s before bed, and his father would come in and talk to us. I know it sounds warped, but I still remember thinking that he was doing this because he was treating us like grown up’s. I think this might have been because my family were extremely prudish with nudity, and I must have felt that nudity was an adult thing, and he was therefore treating us like grown up’s by having a normal conversation. I know it sounds foolish, but I was around 9-10 when this happened, and totally innocent. Remember this was the mid 90s, and whilst we knew about ‘stranger danger’, we didn’t consider friends parents to be strangers, and noone ever talked about child sex abuse. 

I also remembered times when Cameron and I would be taking a shower (one after the other) and he came into the bathroom to talk to us. I also clearly remember that I saw his father naked once, and he entered the shower as I was leaving it. This is probably the clearest memory, because it was the first time I had seen a grown up without any clothing on, and that his nakedness was fully visible and he was standing close to me. Only now as an adult thinking back to that experience, did I realise he was putting himself quite deliberately on display. I just remember him just standing there openly before he entered the shower. I did have a vague memory that he asked Cameron and I to go downstairs, and that Cameron’s mother and sister were entering the door downstairs, but as I said - none of these memories were very clear. 

I hadn’t thought about any of this for years and it dawned on me how innocent I was, in that I didn’t realise that his behaviour was totally inappropriate. I am not saying that families who are more liberal with nudity are doing anything wrong, but knowing now that Cameron’s lawyers said he was abused by his father, I started to feel sick and overwhelmed by anxiety as I tried to work out whether those experiences were linked, and if there were any more experiences that I perhaps couldn’t recall. I really wanted to reach out to Wilson to see if he would be willing to discuss it. I hadn’t spoken to him since we were 12 (more than 25 years ago!) but I fortunately found his profile on facebook. 

I messaged him to let him know who I was and named the school and year we finished. ‘Hey.. this is Ryan and we were best friends in primary school. I am not sure if you saw this link, but our other friend Cameron was just convicted of child sex abuse… I know we haven’t been in touch since were kids, but I am hoping you would be open to having a chat with me. I am just remembering some things from my childhood involving Cameron’s father’. I left my mobile number and waited for his response.

Wilson responded that same day ‘Oh my god, I saw this story too and I am really glad you reached out. I have been feeling so sick about all of this, and this has opened up a lot for me too.’. Wilson said he would call that night. When he called, we ended up speaking for 2.5 hours. His memory was stronger than mine, but that’s probably because the poor guy had more to remember. He said he was abused many times by Cameron’s father during those same years. The sequence of events was almost identical to my memories. On the first nights when he slept over, Cameron’s father started entering the room when the boys were changing before bed. He then started entering the bathroom whilst he was showering, and he eventually entered the shower, which is when the abuse started. He said that Cameron would often be there when it happened, but had no memory of me being there. This went on for a couple of years and ended in the first year of high school when he turned 13. It was around this age he actually started to become aware that what his father had done was sexual and wrong, and only then he felt uncomfortable about it. He stopped talking to Cameron around that time, and they fell out of touch.

Wilson never reported it or told anyone, however entered into therapy for some time when he was an adult as he tried to process what he had experienced. I still don’t know if I remember that day in the shower accurately, however if Cameron’s mum had unexpectedly arrived home, that probably saved me from suffering the same abuse. I had no idea how close I came to experiencing things that could have completely turned my life around. It shocks me to remember my innocent child’s mind having no awareness that anything was wrong, and it would have been so easy to have taken advantage of that naivety. I am still wondering if I have suppressed anything more that might have happened, and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it, so I will book into therapy to try and work through it. I have changed names in this story, as Wilson still hasn’t told anyone, and I don’t want anyone reading to piece this together, but the entire experience has shaken me so much. I am glad that there is more awareness about abuse, and people are more open with their children, but please, PLEASE educate and protect your kids. I only now know how easy it is for predators and groomers to take advantage of children.
