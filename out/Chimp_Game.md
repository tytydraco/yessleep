It was Christmas and as a gift for the whole family, my father decided that we would go to the zoo, we would all go except my grandmother since she was sick so we were only my 2 parents, I am 12 years old, and my younger brothers who were twins, one was a boy and the other was a girl. Upon arrival we spent several hours walking and seeing the animals in their enclosures, that's how it was until we reached the chimpanzees' habitat, they were calm eating the leaves from the branches that they tore of the trees, but there was one that was very different from the others and that honestly gave me chills, it was one that was far from the others, it was sitting near the shore of a lake, looking straight ahead, but when I stared at it, I I realized that he was looking at me, with an inhuman smile, that made me nervous and I told my father what I was seeing, but strangely he told me that he only saw an ape sitting near a lake, playing with it water for some reason that I did not understand, m My father did not see the same thing as me, but I could swear that monkey looked at me with that sicopat smile, however, that was only the beginning of the nightmare, when we got home we saw that the place was a disaster, the furniture was destroyed, the glass in the windows was destroyed but that was not what disturbed us the most, rather my grandmother appeared from the kitchen but she was crawling on the floor covered in blood, her face full of bruises and her two black eyes, while spit blood from his mouth. my parents came to help her but at that moment, she said.

He is still here.

And in that, that deranged ape that I saw in the zoo appeared from the bathroom door, but now its appearance was more gloomy, its fur was now curly, its canine teeth were longer and thicker. Its milky eyes were light blue. Sure, he said.

GAME TIME.

And with his strong arms he began to hit my grandmother, me and my brothers listened as my grandmother's bones broke and broke. While my parents tried to separate the primate from her but the ape pushed them very hard towards the wall, my Parents told me to get my brothers away from the scene and to call 911, while I was taking my brothers upstairs, I saw how my parents grabbed some knives and stuck them into the primate, I went upstairs and left my brothers in my parents' room. parents and took out the phone to call emergencies, when I went down I could see how the ape was hitting my father on his back with force, while my mother kept stabbing him but in that the ape focused on my mother and rushed towards she began to rip off parts of her face and it also brutally ripped out her teeth and my mother could only scream in pain and then the ape began to eat my mother's face, I wanted to go help my parents but I tripped on the stairs and fainted, when I woke up I was being taken in an ambulance with my father, when I asked him about my grandmother and my mother, he told me with some tears in his eyes that they did not make it, while we walked away, I saw how the forensics took the primate's body shot, after 4 years, me and my father have taken care of the family and my brothers have become very close to me. But I still wonder what exactly that thing was? How did he know where we lived? How could he go unnoticed and enter our house as if nothing had happened? I doubt it was an animal, an animal wouldn't do something like that, or at least not with that level of evil.
