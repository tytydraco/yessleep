Growing up, Christmas was magical. The tree glowing softly in the corner, the smell of gingerbread wafting through the house, and the laughter of my family made it feel like nothing could ever go wrong. But there was one tradition that always felt… off.

Every Christmas Eve, just before bed, my parents would gather us around the fireplace. They’d turn off all the lights except for the glow of the fire and hand each of us a small bell. “Shake it once for Santa,” Dad would say with a smile. “He needs to hear you.”

So we did. We’d each shake our bells in unison, filling the room with soft jingling, and then my parents would blow out the fire.

And that was it.

When I was young, I never thought twice about it. But as I got older, I started to notice strange things. The next morning, the fire would always be relit, even though no one got up to do it. There were faint, charred handprints on the brick surrounding the fireplace.

One year, when I was about 12, I asked my mom why we did it.

Her face turned pale. “It’s just tradition,” she said, brushing me off.

But that answer wasn’t enough.

Last Christmas, I decided to stay up. I was 16 and too curious for my own good. My parents and little brother had gone to bed, the house was silent, and the fire had been snuffed out.

I sat in the dark, the faint scent of smoke lingering in the air, waiting.

At first, nothing happened. I almost gave up and went to bed.

Then I heard it.

A faint jingling, like someone shaking a bell far off in the distance.

I froze.

The sound grew louder, closer, until it was coming from the chimney itself. I held my breath, staring at the dark opening, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.

Something moved.

I didn’t see it at first, but I felt it—the cold draft that followed as a tall, gaunt figure emerged from the chimney. Its limbs were unnaturally long, its head bent to fit under the low ceiling. Its skin was ashen, flaking, with dark burns trailing up its arms.

And it was holding a bell.

It raised the bell slowly and shook it once, the sound sharp and clear in the silent room. I couldn’t move.

Its head turned toward me, hollow eyes boring into mine. A jagged smile spread across its face as it whispered in a voice that sounded like crackling fire:

“You’re not supposed to watch.”

The room went black.

I woke up in my bed the next morning, trembling, my clothes reeking of smoke. My parents acted like nothing had happened, but when I went downstairs, I saw a fresh set of charred handprints on the fireplace—and a bell sitting on the mantel.

I haven’t shaken a bell since. But every Christmas Eve, I hear it.

And every year, it gets louder.
