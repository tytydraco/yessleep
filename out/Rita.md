I still remember the first time i met her. We where both eleven years old, going to summer camp. Nothing stood out to me; i came here every year, except a tan girl in a mint-green dress dancing around in the greenery. I remember my first though being "wow, she looks like an angel." I didn't realize i was staring until she suddenly stopped and smiled. She ran up to me and said, 
"Hi i'm Rita! What's your name?" Her voice was airy and almost melancholic. I froze, blushed and stuttered a responce. She smiled and asked if we could be friends. From that moment on, she was my idol.

She was sweet as sugar, pure as a rose and a god in my eyes. I was ugly, and, hey, i still am. Everything from my tangled red hair, to my obese thighs or my teeth that looked like apricots. I was ugly. So ugly. I felt like a dugong in a rag hanging out with a sea-nymph. She was pretty. Too pretty. Her eyes where blue like sapphires, her legs slim like needles and her smile like the sun. 

We'd hang out all the time after that, going to the mall, having sleep-overs, etc. We where like siblings, well exept i was butt-ugly and she wasnt. 

I remember that summer in 05' i had just turned fourteen, and was dating a guy named Robert. Having the textbook teen life.  We where sitting on the balcony, staring at the pink sunset. And i asked her "Have you ever been inlove?" 

"Yes" she responded

" With who?"

"..."

"Okay. Are you inlove?"

"Yes." 

"Who is it?"

"A girl..."

I froze. Rita was gay!? Oh my gosh. 

"...Is it me?......"

"Yes." She hissed, in her slavic accent.

We looked at eachother, kissed passionately, pulled back and looked at eachother again.

We didnt say anything, just continued to look at the sky. 

Finally 
-------------
We had to keep it a secret. Otherwise, hell would break loose. We had always known it but, dang, it was strange. 

 

In our young adult years was when we realized how much we loved eachother. We'd kiss while lisening to old rock music, then stop, and scurry back to our 'normal' selfs. God, i miss those days. 

In college, we shared a dorm with two other girls, Karin and Molly. Karin was an old friend of mine. With long blond hair and an attitude. Molly was just... there. 
She would all give weird glances at me and Rita. Idiot. 

All four of us became a sort of friend group. Doing the typical college stuff. Drinking, chatting, and, of course encouraging eachothers terrible behaviors. 
This brings me to the begining of the end for my ecstasy. Anorexia. 

We decided this was the summer we got bikini bodies; but it would end with puking broccoli in a bucket.

We started doing all the stupid diets; Cabbadge soup,  ice â€“ all being regurgitated in the sink. 

Doing cardio or swimming for an hour straight. But, it wasnt that hurtful. Oh god.

Rita took it the hardest, though she was the only one of us that classified as skinny. She'd live on diet soda, and stopped eating, ever. She'd run until she passed out or bled from her feet. We told her she had to stop, but she whould not. Sometimes we whould force feed her spaggetti or pizza. But the gagging from her room signalized it didnt make it into her stomach. 

She went from fifty kilos, to fourty-three, to thirty-eighth. 

She'd roll around on the floor, telling us 'Anna' was talking to her. Telling her to puke and starve to death. Telling her to kill herself. We cound't do anything about it. She'd threaten to kill us if we called a mental hospital. Though, i doubt she could. Molly left, thinking it was too terrible for her  to see. Karin just frowned when she heard Rita talk about Anna. 

"Anna says, she'll kill me if i don't starve"

"Anna says i'm an obese pig"

Blah blah blah

I still remember the saddest day in my life. April the sixth. That when i found her dead. She was only twenty-seven kilos. I knew she'd be happy about it. 

I cradled her small body in my arms. Kissed her forehead and sobbed. 

I went outside to the pear tree she loved. Dug a hole and put her corpse there. Kissed her one last time and touched her tiny thigh.

But i coudnt help being proud. It brought her to her dream, and i hadnt gotten away with it. All those months, i stood there, whipping her, calling her slurs, telling her if she doesnt starve i'll kill her myself. All this time, hurting her, that was my goal. Such a pretty being shouldnt exist. Stupid bitch. Now she's dead. I killed her. 

After all, Anna is my name.
