“Eat dirt, James! I hope you fucking die!”

To be honest, I had heard worse from exes, and Silas had absolutely no follow through. If I had to rank him on a scale of 1-10 on likelihood of coming after me with an axe, he was a big fat goose egg. Which was more than I could say for some of my other exes. 

This relationship had been a good one, too. Cozy cottage in the middle of the mountains, about a mile hike from the nearest small town. He was cute and sweet, worked at the only general store on day shift. I grimaced as I ambled my way down the drive, realizing that I had screwed myself out of getting groceries at a normal time for the rest of the week.  Ah well. Despite the luxuries of a warm bed and a warm body, work was work and when it was done there was no reason to hang around. 

I lit up a cigarette as I passed his car, glancing at my reflection in the windows. Sickly pale, lanky, dark messy hair and bags under my eyes that never fully seemed to fade. Slap me in a trench coat and let me loose in the woods at night and I could spark a whole slenderman resurgence. I mean, I did in Illinois a few years ago, but I’m saying it could happen again easily. 

All of this is a meandering way of getting through to the actual report. I hope, Nevarez, that having to read every word of my inner monologue makes you want to finally listen to that Shadow of yours and off yourself. Anyways.

**Operative James Linman. Incident Report 212: The Spider.**
 
Where was I? Ah, yeah, Incident report. So I got dumped. Nothing new there. I know a lot of our agents prefer the hotel approach, but I find that it’s a lot easier to shack up with someone who lives In Area when dealing with the anomalies. In small towns especially, it ingratiates you to the locals. Nobody likes a stranger who lurks in a motel. Bobby’s new boyfriend though? He’s a real peach, if not a bit sick looking. But I like to let my boyfriends dump me when the job is finished. I spend all this time worming my way into their lives, you know? Feels kinda mean to leave without a word and boy do they feel vindicated when they get to lay into me at the end. 

Sure, you could say it’s mean to date around with the intent of free housing and worming my way into hearts and minds, but that’s just part of the job. People get hurt, and it’s a good day when it’s only their feelings. 

Sometimes it really amazes me though, how lonely people are. How quickly they let me ‘visit’ for a while. I had been shacked up with Silas for about a month. A ‘visit’ on the second week of our relationship that had lasted a lot longer than that. After a month, I figured that if there was actually anything to the reports, I would have found it by now.

I know you’re a desk jockey these days, Nevarez,  so let me remind you of what field work is like. 

Field work is shit.

Field work fucking sucks. 

In this case, reports had made their rounds of an amalgamate *thing* in the woods. Descriptions had varied, but it had supposedly torn a teenage girl limb from limb at a party in a clearing and really shaken up the whole area, not to mention the kids who had seen it didn’t make a lick of sense. HQ had a hunch that it was something akin to a psychic manifestation that projected out a variable form based on the fuckin’...collective fears of their victms or something. I didn’t exactly buy that once, because I can think of a lot of things that scare teens, and spider made of flesh doesn't even make the top twenty.

 Axe murderer, limb spider, PK Entity, serial killer- whatever it was, I got assigned to it, and that meant every night from dusk til dawn I was trudging through the forest and searching for signs, all the while doing my best to look especially murderable to anything nearby.

It wasn’t fun, and I hadn’t found shit. So when Silas inevitably broke up with me for being distant and not present and cold and all the usuals, I figured it was time to call it a wash and phone in as much. I’d be out of town in less than a week. 

But before that…I had some time to kill, and since it was a mile or so back to town anyways, I figured I’d give it one last go. 

In hindsight, I really should have gone back to Silas and dealt with his angry tears while I grabbed some of my more essential shit, but I thought I’d give him the night to cool down and come collect in the morning.  I figured I had my gun and my shitty phone light, and aren’t monsters always just more drawn to the unprepared? 

Damn, I hate how good I am sometimes. 

All this to say that as the sun was setting I found myself veering off road and into the woods about five hundred or so feet down the road from Silas’s place. Maybe I shouldn’t have swerved so close to the house, but maybe I didn’t want to feel it at my back. Maybe this one hurt. 

When you were out in the field, did you ever get the feeling that you were completely and utterly fucked? Like an anvil hanging over your head with someone about to snip the rope. The second I stepped into those woods, I knew it. It's a primal instinct, I guess.  Some of the other old hands like to say they don’t fear anything anymore. They’ve seen it all. But between you and me, they’re so full of shit they reek from ten doors down.

I’ve been doing this for years, and nine times out of ten, I still get *scared*. Maybe because no encounter is the same. Every time you look into death’s mirror in this line of work, your reflection is a little bit different. When I look back on these moments, sometimes I think about how I would look if I died right then. And like I said, every time it’s different. 

Anyways, I stepped into the forest and I knew I was fucked. My heartrate never skyrockets too high. People talk about it all the time, the fast heart rate of fear. But for me, it’s different. My whole body just goes numb. Well, numb isn't the right term, exactly. My limbs, my chest, even up my throat, it all goes static, and the static fades into this low frequency that just resonates throughout my whole body. It’s uncomfortable to say the least, and it lets me know that I am in *danger*.

So when I stepped into the woods and started to feel it, I knew that the thing wouldn’t be far behind. It took a little mental kick to keep moving, but I inhaled, exhaled, steeled myself, and kept walking. The forest in the area is the kind of forest where the ground is blanketed in slimy, decaying leaves and detritus. It’s the kind where the branches, even in winter, tangle together in a web and blot out the light of heaven. 

After about thirty steps, the forest got quiet. The kind of eerie quiet you hear about in all the horrific forest stories, the quiet where everything alive goes silent all at once and you are the only thing still moving. Even through the faint ring of static in my ears, I could tell. Another thirty steps and I was not in the same leg of the woods. 

It looked just like the crime scene photos I had been shown, right down to the fresh smears of gore across old pine trunks, like someone had taken a brush dipped in coagulated blood and decided to give Jackson Pollock a run for his money. Old party cups crushed underfoot and a half keg of beer overturned to make an alcoholic puddle in the middle of the clearing. Cigarette buts ringing the firepit, full of charred wood and ash. 

I had been here before, with two important differences. First, It had been cleaned of blood and cordoned off with police tape last week. Second, there had not been a malformed hand clinging to one of the wider pine trees. It was still silent save for the ringing in my ears. I’d like to say I was calm. That when I fished out a pack of cigarettes from my pocket and lit one up, it was to look cool and establish how nonchalant I was. My hand was shaking though, even if I mostly controlled the tremble. I made a pretty good show of pacing around the firepit first, only looking at the hand from the corner of my eyes. It was easily the size of my head, with thick, cracked nails in a rotten black and pale, waxy white flesh like a corpse.

It moved as I circled the firepit, even though I never saw it so much as twitch. Whatever way I turned, though, it was clinging to a tree just at the edge of my sight, right up until I saw one massive finger unfurl slowly and point right at me. I took a good drag before I pulled out my gun for all the good it would do me, and exhaled a cloud of smoke. 

To be honest, if I could turn back time and put my gun to my head and blow my own brains out right there, I’d probably do that. Not because I’m suicidal. I just think that might have been easier.

Instead, when the haze cleared, I was faced with myself. Yeah, yeah. When I say I’d blow my brains out, I don’t mean *mine*. Not exactly. I stood across the firepit from myself, hands in the pockets of my coat. “Cold as shit out here,” I said to myself. 

“Yeah.” I know, I shouldn’t have answered me. Him. it. Whatever. But to be honest, I was dumbstruck, and my veins had turned to ice. In a way, I was operating on autopilot. And talking about the weather is an autopilot situation.  

“No sign of the limb spider.” It said to me with a shrug. 

“What about the hand?” When I asked, Not Me smiled with malice. 

“Everyone needs a hand, James.” it, he, said patiently. “Especially you. Especially now.”

“What does that mean?” Everything inside of me was begging me to run, Nevarez, I’ve never felt as scared as I did at that moment. Hell, I’ve dealt with doppelgangers before. More than once- and they *always* take my face. This was different. A doppelganger feels distinctly like a reflection, an uncanny valley mimic of yourself that’s got something wrong with it-smile too wide, eyes too dark, *something*. This, though? This was like looking at my identical twin. It could have stepped into my life to replace me, and I’m not sure anyone would have known. 

Not Me smiled easily, the same kind of semi flirtatious half gtin I had mastered in the mirror to disarm people. He raised one hand, and pointed just over my head.

I know I shouldn’t have looked, but I want it to be clear that I was absolutely thrown. Being scared can slow you down, make you stupid if you aren't careful- but I’ve been online in the field long enough that fear mistakes are few and far between. Being *thrown* feels entirely different. Being thrown is what made me look up. 

If the moon had been out, this thing would have blotted it out entirely. If this thing had been lit up by the moon, I'd probably have nightmares for the rest of my life.

Putrescent feels like a good word for it. It was a spider of limbs, all right. It’s eight or so malformed arms and legs that each reached about seven feet or so to press against the trees and suspend the main body right over my head. The limbs were pale and covered with pustules that burst and formed as if the flesh underneath them was simmering. The torso looked like an obese stomach, a massive gut with folds of pale, fleshy fat that climbed their way up to the neck of the thing like a badly designed turtleneck. And inches from my upturned face, a giant, leering  face with a patchy beard and yellowed teeth, the area around its mouth caked in dried blood.

When I met its bulging eyes, its face lit up with childish glee, like it had been waiting for me to notice. 

I want to say I didn’t scream, so instead I’ll say I yelped, and thank god for my reflexes because I instinctively dropped to the floor as one massive, spindly limb shot towards where my head had been. Hit the deck and roll is a procedure that has never failed me, and this was no different. I already had my gun out, and so I fired an ineffectual shot into its face before shooting to my feet and bolting beneath the body, coming out on the other side. 

The gunshot may not have actually hurt it, but the impact stunned it enough that as I scrambled my way out from underneath it, it didn’t kill me immediately.  At the edge of the clearing, Not James was waiting for me, leaning casually against a tree and flashing me my own insufferable smile again. “Leave all your shit at home?”, he asked charmingly. “That’s no good, you know. Sloppy.”

“Thanks,” I gritted through my teeth, “very helpful.”

“I can be helpful,” Not James said, even as the spider dropped to the ground. For a moment it reminded me of a grotesque baby deer as it worked to find purchase on the ground, multitudes of hands flailing and grasping. I was distracted by Not James, unfortunately, so one of those hands clasped itself around my ankle. 

And with a gleeful shriek like a toddler given a treat, the spider pulled me in. When my skull cracked against a rock, I thought it was a small mercy that I wouldn’t be awake when I was torn to pieces. 

So no, as I’ve told every higherup who’s asked, I did not kill the Spider. And yes, as I’ve told every higherup who’s asked, I am putting it in the incident report. Two weeks. I can’t believe it took you guys two weeks to find me. I can’t believe I was- i can’t believe I’m perfectly fine after being unconscious in the woods for two weeks next to a giant fucking cryptid’s oozing corpse. 

Clay down in the lab says they STILL haven't figured out what the oil oozing from the body was. And god forbid anyone get Lara started on the ring of stones that was surrounding my body when the recovery team found me. 

It’s all bad, Nevarez. I keep having these weird dreams about myself. Or Not James. I’m not sure I can tell the difference.

But like I said, field work is shit.

**End report.**
