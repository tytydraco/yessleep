[My first encounter with it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fm0ig1/when_the_equinox_falls/)

It was still the 21st of September by the time I arrived back in town. Right away, I could tell that things were different, even as I was driving. The lush trees awash with autumn's spectrum were now drooping under some unseen weight. I examined one. Taking out my combat knife and slicing it into the trunk, water came pouring out. In seconds, it went from clear to thick and red. 

I watched it spill onto the leaves, then got back in my car and continued. It's a given that the years will change a place, but I was not prepared for the contrast between the place I spent the first twelve years of my life and the town I was currently seeing. Buildings and houses alike were heavy with water damage. Leaves and toppled trees covered the streets. The fruit known as Dead Leaf Falls had become true to its name.

The scar on my leg began aching, sending a chill throughout my body. I already knew what had happened. It had happened. Still, I needed answers. There was only one person I could think of who might be willing to give me answers, the librarian, Ms. Corinne Brown. 

 I didn't trust adults growing up. She was an exception, always willing to provide a quiet place where Amanda and I could get away from our overbearing parents. Every so often, she would pass out candy to kids. On the holidays, she would go all out, covering the library interior in decorations.  Halloween was the biggest event for her.

 She'd have a new costume every year and do a dramatic reading of different scary stories. As comforting as I find these memories, I had to face the facts. That being, like the others, she knew of it and how it took kids, how it was going to take Amanda. I sat parked in front of a gas station, weighing my options. The Equinox wasn't for nearly an entire day. 

Like the town, I, too, had changed. I had been hardened by my time in the military, and it changed me from a nervous, lanky kid to someone more capable. The chances of someone immediately recognizing me were unlikely. Given that, I thought going straight to the library and announcing myself to Ms. Brown may not be the best idea. Therefore, I decided to get a sense of the townspeople's mood. 

First, I needed some food as I hadn't eaten since yesterday.  I went into the convenience store and got a Green Apple Gatorade along with several packs of trail mix, a Zero Bar, and some beef jerky.  While the cashier rang up my items, I struck up a conversation.

“Hey, what happened around here?” I asked.

“Storm,” the cashier replied, not looking at me.

“I figured. The damage seems pretty bad. Does it happen often?”

Now, we were making eye contact. Dark circles were under his eyes.

“Why do you care?”

“Just curious.”

“We've gotten used to it. Now, unless you want a pack of cigarettes or something, I'm going to need you to leave.”

I paid for my things, along with some gas, and went back to my car. Ravenously, I devoured my food, waterfalling the trail mix and chasing it with the Gatorade. As I was eating, the cashier's words echoed in my head.

*We've gotten used to it.*

Whatever it was causing, it wasn't merely a storm. It was a devastation. Why hadn't anyone moved? Was it stubbornness? Even that had its limits. 

The town was damn near unlivable. This meant the answer was they couldn't. This made me experience conflicting emotions. On one hand, all the adults were complicit in some way of children being taken. As far as I was concerned, their date was deserved.

 Then again, that meant people who had nothing to do with it were suffering. I closed my eyes, trying to organize my thoughts.

I opened them and asked, “Hey, what do you think I should do, Amanda?”

Suddenly, the mark on my leg felt strange. I lifted my pants leg and touched it. There was a faint sensation similar to static electricity. It didn't hurt. It was like it was trying to give me a spark. I smiled.

“Guess I have to see this through then.”

During my service, I'd been all over the world, taking the opportunity to inquire about The Fall Fairy.  I sought out the likes of fortune tellers and spiritualists. I've had my weapons and ammo charmed by people of various cultures. I didn't know if it would make a difference, but I needed all the help I could get. Some sold me ammo of various metals. 

I painted my guns to correspond with them. When I arrived back in the States, I came across a town with [an old woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OcFXQ1mjHA) who gave me a charm. It was a necklace of a silver spider over a golden leaf. I'd picked up similar items over the years, mostly with vague promises of protection by the sellers. This one was different. 

In my palm, I swear it was pulsing. I've held onto it for years and I knew that the time would come for it to aid me. Eventually, I decided to take a trip down memory beginning with my neighborhood. My parents never mentioned having any relatives so I wondered what became of the house after they died.  I got my answer when I pulled in front of it. 

The only thing left of it was rubble. The other homes weren't much better off. Roofs were covered in tarp and windows were boarded. Lawns were flooded and not a soul was in sight. Despite that, I knew the neighborhood had residents.

 Why else would there be toys strewn about? One house caught me and I stopped for a closer look. It was abandoned and it's not like anyone would care if I trespassed anyway. The front door was broken into two pieces. Claw marks were on them and there'd clearly been a struggle. 

 Dried blood coated the floor and walls of the living room. The kitchen floor leading to the backdoor had a trail of child-sized nail marks running through it. Outside, I spotted homes in similar condition. My breath hitched at the disturbing thought of how many times this must have unfolded throughout the town. The Fall Fairy seemed no longer content with the twenty-two-year arrangement. 

I went to my old school next. On the way there, I passed homeless encampments. The people in them looked so broken. No children were among them from what I could tell. When I arrived at Dead Leaf Middle,  I was surprised to find not much about the building itself had changed. It made sense.

 The school doubles as a storm shelter which presumably means more money was being put into its maintenance. While the structure remained the same, the same can't be said for the outside. The playground was neglected. The monkey bars were rusted and the wood around them was rotted. The slides were filthy and covered in dead leaves.

The merry-go-round was dented. Lastly, there was only one swing out of four that wasn't lying in a puddle.  It was hanging by a single chain. That was a shame. Amanda and I played on them a lot.

I hadn't gotten much sleep by then since I left the hotel I was staying at early. I checked my phone. If it was still running the same, the library would be closing in half an hour. I drove over there, parking near the entrance. While the building was worn, the years had been more merciful compared to other places in town. 

A wave of nostalgia washed over me upon entering. Ms. Brown was at the checkout desk, finishing up something on her laptop. When her attention went from the screen to me standing before her, she wasn't the least bit surprised. 

“Hello, it’s been a while, Thomas.”

“Yeah, I thought you'd recognize me. How have you been?”

That was a stupid thing to ask, given how sunken her eyes were. That wasn't the best start to a conversation with someone I hadn't seen in over a decade. 

“Better than the rest of town.”

“Are you happy I'm here again?”

She stared for a moment before answering.

“I'm conflicted. I'm assuming you've seen the town.”

“I have. It's horrible. Was it responsible?”

“Only partially.”

Her expression became cold, contrasting with the woman I knew as a preteen.

“I hate to tell you this. You share in the blame. I understand why you ran away back then, but you made it furious and it's been taking its rage out on us.”

“Tell me exactly what has happened since I've been gone.”

“I don't think you want to know.”

“Ms. Brown, please.”

“We're well past that, Thomas. Call me Corinne.”

“Fine, Corinne, what happened to this town?”

Although Amanda being the offering was successful, The Fall Fairy saw the bullet my dad accidentally shot at it as retaliation. Therefore, the deal was violated. It went from taking children once every twenty-two years to every four years.

“Before then, the harvest was plentiful. Now, our farmers are lucky if they grow anything. It sent storm upon storm after us. We can’t take much more and it won't let us leave. Anyone who tries ends up dead.”

Corinne's glare was cold.

“I know you were only a kid back then, but your actions led to this and we've had to suffer.”

“You'd blame me for not wanting to be a part of this, for not wanting to be complicit in letting children be slaughtered?”

“It was one to let everybody else prosper. That was the deal our ancestors made.”

“We had no say in it and I had no intention of living with people who only saw me as a means of continuing some twisted tradition.”

“We depended on it!”

“No, you relied on it!”

Neither of us spoke. Finally, I asked, “Did  you know, by the way?”

“Did I know what?”

“That it was going to take Amanda.”

Guilt creased her face as she was fidgeting with her hands.

“Nobody told me, but it always wants the ones, fullest of life so I had an inkling she was going to be taken.”

At those words, the last bits of trust I had for anyone in town crumpled to dust.

“Sorry to bother you,” I said, turning to leave.

“Wait, what are you planning?”

The look I gave her made her go pale. 

“No, that's suicide.”

For a moment, the concern in her eyes was reminiscent of the kind woman I once knew. 

“You said this is because of what I did so this should be the solution.”

As I was making my way to the door, her next words made me pause.

“I still love them, you know, the children I mean. That's why I tried to make the library fun because I knew any one of them could be taken. When you interact with as many people as I have, you pick up on things about them, especially how parents are actually treating their kids behind closed doors.”

I thought about how I would always stay at the library as long as possible, not wanting to deal with my parents' scrutiny. Oftentimes, Corinne would have to tell me I had to go home. She was never annoyed, though. Instead, it was always with politeness and I would get a piece of bubblegum from her as she sent me on my way. Of course, my mom cared about the carpet like her second child of which it would have been the favorite. 

Therefore, I had to discard the gum on my way home. Still, it was enjoyable while it lasted. I turned around.

“For what it's worth, I never liked your parents either and I did miss you,” Corinne said.

“You and Amanda are the only ones I missed when I was away.”

“I'm sorry. We haven't seen each other in so long and I made it horrible for you.”

“No, you didn't. I still have a lot of time. I can tell you what I have been up to all these years.”

She smiled.

“I'd like that.”

She made some coffee, pouring it into some paper cups, and then I spent the next hour recounting my time in foster care and then in the military. I told her about the friends I made out of it and showed her pictures of me and them together. 

“Well, I'm happy you were able to make something of yourself despite everything. Do you have anyone special?”

“No, I've been too busy to pursue that kind of thing. What about you? Before I left town, I heard rumors that you and the Pharmacist, Mr. Hines were seeing each other.”

“Barton? We did go on a few dates. Nice man, but we never really clicked. Tried seeing some other men. You can see how well that went.”

“That's a shame. Hopefully, that changes for you.”

Corinne smiled again, highlighting the years of weariness.

“At my age? Thanks, but I've come to realize that some things aren't worth the trouble.”

I stared down into my now empty cup and said, “Speaking of…”

“Tommy?” 

I looked at her as she went on.

“There's nothing I can say to make you change your mind?”

Now I was the one smiling.

“Sorry, Corinne, I'm afraid I can't do that.”

I showed her the mark on my ankle.

Seeing it, she sighed before replying, “Then I wish you the best of luck.”

Giving a nod and thanking her for the coffee, I left. I asked one more thing before going.

“Just one more thing. How did you know I would be back?”

“The tree told me.”

I checked into a motel I passed while coming into town. For what I was going to do, rest was essential. My military time taught me some relaxation techniques. Slowing my breathing and focusing only on the faint humming of the AC, I drifted off. That night I had a dream that I was a kid again.

I was standing among the corpses of my parents and the others. Amanda stood in the Fall Fairy's cave. Blood was oozing from a bitten wound in her side. 

“Tommy, this world is bigger than you can comprehend.”

The Fall fairy then appeared behind her, snatching her back into the darkness of its cave. I opened my eyes and sat up. The darkness of night was starting to retract, indicating the Equinox would soon be at hand. Once I was prepared, I drove to the library. Corinne had closed it for the day, leaving only a note saying she wasn't feeling well.

That was smart, the less people around for this, the better. It was when I got to the tree again, did the last thing she said make sense. What makes it unique is there's a pattern in the trunk that resembles a sleeping face. The expression it wore then, though, was as if to say “What took you so long?”.  I went past it into the forest.

 The path hadn't appeared yet, but I knew it would soon. Eventually, there was a shift. The dirt and leaves beneath my boots became more solid and the branches in front of me were snapping as the trees were being forced to part.  I glanced down and saw I was walking on the same path from all those years ago. The only difference is instead of Amanda to keep me company, I only had the mental echoes of our conversation from that day. 

I glanced up as the clouds bled, dousing me with rain. Eventually, I came to that same jack-o-lantern-esque cave. Faint echoes of something stirring were coming from it. Not hesitating,  I stepped in, instantly sensing that this wasn’t merely a cave. 

It was an extension of The Fall Fairy. They shared Prey.  Visibility was almost nonexistent. Even the beam of the military-grade flashlight I brought was swallowed by the surrounding void punctuating my every step. While I couldn’t see, I could still feel.  

The walls were rock solid and yet moved under my touch as if breathing.  Suddenly, my foot found air. Cursing, I slipped, falling into a hole, the rough texture digging into me as I was sliding. Then I found myself blinded by searing light. I came out the bottom, landing hard on my stomach.

  I felt my flashlight hit my back. Then when I regained perception, I got up.  The difference between areas was night and day.  Crystals of nearly every color imaginable surrounded me.  If it weren’t for what this place was home to, it would have been breathtaking. 

Several loose crystals were on the floor. I grabbed one and my heart hammered when I felt it trembling. Even more disturbing is that under that light, a screaming face was visible. A harrowing thought came to me.

“Is this what happened to Amanda?”

Pushing it down, I pressed on, coming to an opening. There I found it, sleeping suspended upside down from the ceiling between two large stalactites. Water was steadily dripping from them into a pond. The mission was to find  The Fall Fairy, kill it, and get out, or die trying. Efficiency is how I was trained.  

The ammo of my weapons was custom and blessed by people all over the world.  I tried the most obvious one first. Pulling ot a revolver, I emptied its iron bullets into the slumbering Fall Fairy. The creature screeched in surprised pain, losing its grip and plummeting into the pond below.  I kept at it, taking out another revolver and continuing to fire at it. 

The Fall Fairy’s wings wrapped around it. When the bullets hit them, they bounced off. 

“Shit,” I  hissed in pain after feeling the burning sensation of one grazing my face.

The Fall Fairy coughed the bullets into its palm and then dropped them into the water. Its wounds healed themselves and then it stared as if to say “you”. Its wings flapped as it was getting ready to lunge. Thinking fast, I pulled out a knife of silver, thrusting it at its chest. The blade pierced its skin as the claws of its hands drew blood from my shoulders.

I pulled out daggers of every metal I had, using them on The Fall Fairy while it was being distracted by pain. All were able to wound it and yet none were able to put it down. There was only one thing left to try. I had brought a grenade as a last resort. If I couldn't get a victory, I would have to settle for a draw. At the very least, I could trap us.

Yanking the pin out, I moved to throw it at The Fall Fairy. By this time, it had recovered and flew at me, grabbing me by the throat and causing the grenade to go flying from my grip.  I saw a flash of pain as it slammed me against the wall. Its mouth opened, revealing rows of needle-like teeth. As it was getting ready to take a bite, the grenade went off, causing parts of the ceiling to collapse.

Something stood out among the falling debris, oval-shaped crystals. Letting out a distressed cry, The Fall Fairy released its grip and lunged under the crystals, catching them. I did wonder why it was doing this. However, that was overshadowed by the opportunity I had. As it was trying to get away while carrying the crystals, I shot it in the back of its knees, making it fall. 

Then the debris collapsed on top of it. Only its head and half an arm were sticking out. If decapitation didn't work, I would see to it that it would be forever incapacitated. Raising one of my combat knives, I was about to deliver the final blow, when it did something chilling.

“Wait,” it rasped.

I wasn't frightened by the fact it was talking. How else could it and our ancestors have made a deal in the first place? No, what bothered me was the way it did it in its insect-esque chirping like any human language was not meant to come out of that thing.

“Please,” it continued, “Your kind is about fairness, right? Then I deserve to be heard!”

“You should have thought of that before you slaughtered all those children.”

I was bringing the knife down when it yelled, “These are my children!”

I stopped and breathed out, “What did you just say?”

“These aren't crystals. They're eggs and each offering is food for them. You can touch one if you don't believe me.”

Doing so confirmed that this was the truth. As soon as I did, I saw the mental image of a fetus with dragonfly wings elongated limbs, and eyes covering its head.

“Surely, you can't hold it against me for ensuring their survival.”

“You expect me to care about your sob story? You have all but destroyed Dead Leaf Falls! You eat children! You killed my best friend! You say it's for survival and yet you only pick those the world needs the most. Tell me why!”

It was silent as if trying to choose its next words carefully.

 “It's not the flesh. It's what has been experienced. We feed off emotions, off of joy, off of memories containing it. My kind is older than you can comprehend. Aside from my future children, I am the last. Amanda was good. If she was here, would she want this?”

“Don't use her fucking name!”

As much as I wanted to kill it and be done, it was right. She would have tried to find another solution despite everything. I stood there as we looked at each other, and then something occurred to me.

“You said you feed off of joyous emotions?”

“Yes.”

“Do they only have to feel that way to the person they belong to?”

It considered these words and then gave a slow nod.

“I think we can work out a new deal then. First, you make the town prosperous again and stop with the storms.”

“Very well, what else?”

“You can't have children to eat anymore. Instead, you will be getting another food source.”

I saw something resembling a curious expression come over it as I was elaborating.

“I've been all over the world and I hate to admit it, but there are some the world would be better off without, those who hurt others not for survival. They do it for pleasure. These are who you will feed off of.”

I reached down to it. Then its hand grabbed mine, shaking it. For the deal to be confirmed, it had to be tested. I helped The Fall Fairy get free. Then it helped me out of the cave and I explained everything to the townspeople.

 It's been steady getting everything back in working order.  I had to drive two hours outside of town just to find someplace that has internet so I could post this. It's why it took me this long to update. I've decided to move back into town to see that things go smoothly. Dead Leaf Falls will no longer be difficult to find for certain people once it’s had its fill of the ones here.

They are the ones it will start attracting along with those who would inflict pain simply for the thrill. Should this apply to you, heed this warning.  If you are driving on the mountain roads of Georgia during a rainy day before Fall, and you come across a sign that says, “Dead Leaf Falls”, it will be too late for you. The Fall Fairy already made the mistake of letting its prey get away once. It won't let it happen again and neither will the town.

Change your ways while you still can or else The Fall Fairy will be the last thing you see. I hope this choice is the right one. What do [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) think, [Amanda?](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
