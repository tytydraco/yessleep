Hey everyone, I found this weird notebook in my hometown, and I was wondering if I should pay it any mind,  this was made by one of my old childhood friends, and he seemed to have uh, gone a bit insane, and disappeared. He was known to make stories a lot, but I don't know if this was one. It just seems too real, yk??  
  
Thanks <:)  
  
  
  
  
Hello. I am a 17 year old in... actually, I don't really know. I guess I could just say I live in Ampty, a small town in Colorado, but that wouldn't be very true. Since I was 9, I've been seeing black trucks, those 16 wheelers, going around my neighborhood. I didn't really care about them back then, they would just talk to the highschoolers on their 18th birthday. But, I always felt like something was off about them because when the highschoolers came back from their birthday trips they seemed different.  
  
At first, I would stop seeing them behind the school near the playgrounds, which was very nice, as they bullied us pretty badly. But you would still see them around Ampty, really mellowed out, but sick. They would sneeze like little dogs, you know, those cute, tiny sneezes that chihuahuas do. But soon after that, you would only see them around their house, and then, not at all.  
  
Actually, I remember my older brother asking someone about it. His name is Anthony, and he was worried about his friend Jakey. I think I was 12 years old, and Anthony was 14. He was born a year and a half before me. Anthoney and Jakey were in the boy-scouts together, and one day Jakey stopped going because he was sick. Anthony saw Jakey's mom while we were messing around in the park, and asked "Hey, how's Jakey doing?" Jakey's mom looked, looking up into the sky and then at the trees, then kinda held onto her elbow with her hand. She answered without looking at Anthony, "He moved."  
  
"What? Why?" Anthony said, he stopped hitting a tree with a stick and looked up at his mom. "He went to college." she replied quickly, and then Anthony asked, "But, why didn't he say goodbye?"   
  
"He did."  
  
"What? When?"  
  
"You must have not been at scouts!"  
  
Jakey's mom seemed annoyed, and she left while Anthony was still asking questions. A few years later, when I was 15, me and Anthony had developed a sort of obsession with this stuff, we started to see that other kids had wanted to learn about this stuff too, finding dumped notebooks in the park. But, nobody had ever written anything further than just "I found it out" or something, and then the rest of the pages were... disturbing. It was just nonsense and jibberish,  like random configurations of numbers, sentences all not making any sense, un-connected.  
  
Me and Anthony figured that whatever they found out, had made them go kinda insane. We just assumed it had been something like they found 'forbidden knowledge' like those ARG things, but that all changed when I was 16. I was coming home through the park with supplies for Anthony's surprise birthday party when I tripped. I saw some of the confetti poppers fall into some bushes. I collected all the party supplies and tried to see if I could find the poppers.  
  
I realized I had to go and dig around the bushes, and I bent over and started to use my hands to part the branches. It felt very quiet, and all I could feel was a bit of wind. I put my head right into the split I made with my hands and still couldn't find it. I suddenly lost my balance and fell through the bushes. Immediatly, I noticed that I was bleeding, some branches must have scratched me. I looked around and was surprised, behind all the bushes there was a grey wall and floor.   
  
My eyes slowly adjusted to the unlit environment, and I noticed a notebook. I read the name on the cover, Jakey. At first, I was a little surprised Jakey was trying to find out what was happening, but I still read through it. It seemed to be the same stuff as all the other kids trying to find things out, but there was one difference, he dated all of his entries. I noticed his 'revelation page' (what Anthony called it) was dated April 7th, 2018. 2 months and 4 days after his 18th birthday, which I paid no mind, but then saw that his journal entries continued,   
  
"I know what happened to Colby! He was taken on one of those trucks and then we were told he went to college (As the fuck if! He had shit for grades!) but you know what really happened? He was trying to figure this stuff out too, so did all those guys who went missing! They took him and infected him or something on his 18th, they did the same for the rest too. I think the only reason I haven't been found out is because I keep my books next to the walls, and they dont clean up behind here!"  
  
THE FUCK?? What 'walls'??? I slowly got out of the bushes and started walking back to the house thinking about the book. "If the reason he wasn't found out is because he hid stuff by these 'walls' and I don't even know what they are, does that mean something is going to happen to me or Anthony?" I thought to myself. I looked behind me, hearing something, and I saw a flash of black, turning away as it noticed me.  
  
Well, anyways, I wasn't able to reach Anthony because he was camping with some friends, and when he came back I rushed to the door, "Anthony! You won't believe what I just found, I think we're in danger!" he seemed weird, like he was staring through me. "We aren't in any danger, brother. I think we were wrong to have questioned people's educational choices." "Holy shit, this guy is sounding like chat GPT!" I thought.   
  
Well, Anthony slowly developed the sneeze, and then one night I heard him sneezing, maybe one time a second. then twice a second, then he started screaming, it was horrifying. he started sneezing, continuously, like one colossal sneeze. I heard him screaming, crying and shambling on the floor under the sneezing. I peeked out of my room's door and saw him crawling over to the fireplace. He was still screaming and crying, when he turned around with my father's hunting rifle in his hand. I saw him, staring at me, blood spurting out of his nose, but he was no longer screaming. He looked at me one last time, blood pooling around him on the carpet from his nose.   
  
He seemed to mouth something out, and then used the rifle to kill himself. I watched, but it seemed like nothing more came out of his head. Since that day, I have noticed more of those trucks following me around, my parents deny everything I have seen, even my brother. My 18th birthday is tomorrow, and I just don't know anything still. What are the walls? What are the sneezes from? Why are these BASTARDS in the trucks doing this? And shit, I just looked up Ampty, there is nothing about it. I made a few copies of this notebook and hid them around, maybe sometime someone will be able to figure it out.  
  
I don't know what else to do.  
  
I'm gonna die, and I know how I will.  
  
Unless I do it now.
