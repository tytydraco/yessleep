I met him at a bar. Now, this doesn’t sound all that thrilling, but when you’re someone like me, the idea of talking to a random stranger in public is truly horrifying. I didn’t talk to him first, of course. I would’ve never had the nerve. Shockingly, he came to me. To someone like me. 

*Someone like me*…

Everyone who is different is a *someone like me.*

I was a 30-year-old woman who’d never had a man say he loved me. I’d never had someone hold me tight and say, “May, everything will be okay, because we have each other.” My loneliness was suffocating, and I needed to break free and *live*.

My loneliness started in high school at a sophomore dance. I had a crush on a skinny boy with crooked teeth. Matt Birch. We’d locked eyes in algebra class that morning; he smiled at me, and I melted inside. At the dance, wearing my cutest, frilliest dress, I walked over and asked him to dance. I was nervous, shaking and sweating. My voice trembled. Matt looked at me disinterestedly and said, “Sorry, I only dance with pretty, popular girls.” Kids laughed at me. It became a cacophony pounding inside my head. My cheeks burned. My skin dampened. “But you… you smiled at me,” I weakly said. He shrugged. “I felt sorry for you, weirdo.” 

Suddenly, it was as if I’d entered a hazy dream world. I not only saw the kids, but I also saw their *souls* floating above them, attached by slithering tendrils. I saw souls with welcoming, bright, colorful tendrils. I saw souls with frightening, bleak, black tendrils. Their auras revealed their true selves only I could see. The meaner the kid, the darker their tendril. Was it *really* their souls I was seeing? 

Somehow, I knew it was. 

I also felt a strong, sickening sense of impending doom, like death was coming for me. I stumbled around the dance floor in my dream state, running from death that felt attached to me like a cyst, then… 

Darkness. 

I awoke twenty minutes later on the floor in the middle of the gymnasium, being tended to by a kind bearded EMT. He said, “You had a seizure, but you’re okay now.” I didn’t feel okay. I felt angry. What had I done to deserve this? Why was I cursed? Why couldn’t I just have one lousy dance with a cute boy? All I could say in response to the EMT was, “Shit.” He laughed. I cried. 

It was the last time I approached a boy I liked. 

That was the start of my epileptic seizures, seemingly brought on by emotional stress. Epilepsy has no cure. Medication helped somewhat, but caused hair loss, dizziness, and depression, as if I needed to feel more depressed. Just great. 

Mom mentioned some history of epilepsy and “mental stuff” in our family, but wouldn’t elaborate. She had no intention of being any help whatsoever, too busy with dinner parties, wine tastings, and practicing her fake smile. Dad mostly pretended he didn’t have a daughter, and the drunker he got, the less he had to pretend. He just simply forgot about me. 

Epilepsy was just something I’d have to manage. My hazy dream world, otherwise known as an “aura,” is the warning sign a seizure is coming; the hazy dream world would come about one-to-five minutes before the full seizure took hold of my body. 

The seizures persisted, whenever my stress level was high. I lost friends. I had a few high school boyfriends, but they all quickly bailed, not wanting to deal with the embarrassment of a girlfriend who often fell to the ground and shook violently in front of the whole school. One awful guy gave me his number, saying he’d love to have sex with me while I was having a seizure. “That would be a trip,” he said, grinning. I cried for three days. 

A normal life seemed out of the question for *someone like me*.

For the next decade or so, I removed the one thing in my life that caused me the most stress – dating. Many long, lonely years passed. I rarely had seizures, but also rarely had fun. Life was a grind, a mind-numbing routine of isolation, boredom, and hopelessness. Until… I awoke on my thirtieth birthday, had a good cry, then angrily wiped my face and made a fateful decision.  

“Screw this!” I was going to live again and find love, to hell with the consequences. The burning question was, would anyone love me back? Would anyone love… *someone like me*? 

Someone would. Or some*thing*, to be precise. 

\* \* \*

My best friend, Celina Shaw – a tattooed, spikey-haired, punk-loving nurse I met after a seizure a few years earlier – was my rock. She was also her husband Steven’s rock, but I didn’t mind sharing. Celina was everything I wasn’t; she was fashionable and cool and fun and adventurous and spontaneous. I loved being around her. She always made me smile, even on days when a smile seemed impossible.

“I’m glad you’re at least going to try, May. You deserve happiness. And frankly, it’s depressing watching you waste your perfectly cute face and tight body on Jane Austen novels and Netflix.” 

“I also read a lot of Stephen King and true crime,” I said. “I have many interests.” She didn’t laugh.  

“I’m going to be honest,” Celina said. “You need to get laid like no one’s ever needed to get laid. Are you ready?”

I nodded, then quickly panicked and said, “No.” She replied, “Too bad. It’s happening.” 

We were going out to find me a man. In public. With lots of drunk, horny people around. I almost passed out thinking about it. 

“You were right all along,” I said. “I’m *choosing* to be happy. I just hope there’s a guy out there who won’t mind his date occasionally dropping to the ground, convulsing, and losing control of her bowels.”

“Don’t worry. Guys love that shit.” Celina was ever the optimist. 

“Not literally I hope, but I appreciate your support.”

We set up shop in a back booth at a local, non-divey bar. We were looking cute and wearing very little. We people-watched. More specifically, man-watched.  

“Let’s find your first victim,” she said.

“I’m not a vampire.” 

“Too bad. That would be so hot,” she said. 

Every man that passed by, we were watching. Stealthily. Or not-so-stealthily. Celina was a harsh critic, but I felt bad. Who was I to judge a man because his ears were too big or his mustache made him look like a 1970’s porn star? But I soon got into the swing of it, felt the rush of possibility. So many men passing by, a few of them turning to us and smiling. Men were looking at me, and I was looking back. Well, briefly, until I shyly turned away. 

Enticing man after enticing man looked my way. Great hair. Nice butt. Lovely smile. Big feet. How could I possibly choose? Turns out, I couldn’t. Celina tired of me saying “Not him” over and over. 

She said, “It doesn’t work if you refuse to talk to boys.” I said I was sorry, but before we could continue, she took a call from work, then hugged me and said she had an emergency. I decided to stay a while longer. Besides, my sweaty butt was kind of stuck to the booth seat.  

As she was leaving, Celina said, “I wish I could be gay for you, May. That would solve all your problems.” I said, “It would have to be a throuple, because you’re never getting rid of Steven. That man is whipped.” She laughed. “True,” she said, walking away. 

I sat at the booth alone, nursing a virgin cocktail. It was getting late. The bar was clearing out. Wobbling people exited, alone or in pairs, hopeful or miserable. I was on Celina’s socials, looking through her pics of the night, hoping she wouldn’t post any pics of me, but of course she did. She documented her fabulous life in New York City like it was an expedition into some undiscovered country she wanted to conquer. New York was her oyster. All I’d ever gotten from the oyster was bacteria. But then something happened.

A folded piece of paper landed on my table, like a note being tossed in high school. I looked up quickly and glimpsed the back of a man walking past and out the door. I saw him through dirty glass in the distance for only a second as he looked back. He smiled at me. Handsome. Mysterious. Seemingly interested in *me*. Things had sure taken a turn. 

The note had a name – Mark. And a phone number. That’s it. What was I supposed to do with that? Well, sure, call him. But that’s not what *someone like me* would do. So I chose not to be someone like me. I chose to be a girl who called a random man. I chose to be someone like them.

I ripped myself off the sticky seat, then took a long walk, gathering the courage to make the call. I walked so far, I got lost. Then… I did it! My heart wanted to explode out of my chest and my hands were shaking, but I did it.

“Hello?” he answered. Deep voice. Nice. 

“I’m the… uh, girl from the bar?” Oh, God. I sounded like such a loser. I sounded like a girl who didn’t get picked in gym class, or ever. 

“You mean the tall, pretty girl with auburn hair and a smile to die for? That girl?” 

I laughed nervously. “Wow, I guess that is me. Why didn’t you sit down with me at the booth if you were so interested?” 

“Isn’t this more fun?” 

I had to admit, it was. It was positively thrilling. I sat down on the grimy steps of some building far away from my own, and talked to Mark for what seemed liked forever, but was actually thirty-two minutes. 

“You make me smile,” he said. “Your voice, you sense of humor, your shyness… I like it all.” 

My cheeks burned as I replied, “Thank you. I haven’t made a guy smile in a very long time.” He said he found that hard to believe considering I had a good sense of humor. I told him it was hard not to make fun of myself. Then he said the magic words: “Tell me you want to go out with me on a real date.” So dramatic, so exciting. I replied, “Yes, I want to do that thing… dating… with you.” Holy shit. This was going to happen. Unless I chickened out. But I didn’t.  

It was done. I didn’t know misery was about to come my way. I was too busy trying not to pass out. I was also trying to find a place to pee. Not easy late at night in the city. But it didn’t matter.

I was floating.

\* \* \*

I took my seizure meds before the date, just to be safe, even though I knew it would make me feel terrible. I stared at myself in the mirror for a good long time. I hadn’t worn make-up or my little black dress and heels in years. It felt strange, but nice. I had to admit, I looked damned cute.

Looks were never the problem. I was not a bad-looking person by society’s standards. I looked fine. More than fine sometimes. Celina said I was “hot,” though she was known to be a serial flatterer. 

The problem was *inside* my body, the problem was the gremlins in my brain who only appeared when they wanted to ruin my happiness. My gremlins were otherwise known as neurotransmitters. My neurotransmitters were fucking assholes. 

\* \* \* 

We met at a park near my San Francisco apartment. I sat on a bench and nervously waited. I felt dizzy, like I might lose myself for a moment and flutter out of reality. “Just hold on,” I said out-loud.  

Then he appeared, walking slowly in my direction, almost gliding, smiling wide and waving. What I had only seen behind dirty glass came into view. He was sexy… breathtaking, really; a great smile and muscles in the right places. His suit fit perfectly. His brown hair was slightly too long, but adorably so. His eyes were almost otherworldly – gray, with flecks of blue that seemed to be floating like glitter in a cloud. 

“May Weeks?” 

“That’s me. Sorry, I… uh, I’m really nervous.” 

“Relax. This is nothing but a good time, no expectations,” he said, right before hugging me. I buried my head in his neck and discreetly sniffed. His scent was strong, a cologne I didn’t exactly love. If we lived happy-ever-after, I could find the perfect scent for him. Yes, I was already thinking about how I wanted him to smell. 

We walked and talked for hours. Along Fisherman’s Wharf mostly, looking out at the Bay. Our silences were few and comfortable. I did most of the talking, channeling my nervous energy into word vomit about movies and books I loved. He curiously watched me devour a bacon-wrapped hot dog I bought from a street vendor.

I was so charmed by him that I almost didn’t notice how shitty the medication was making me feel. I told him about my boring job as an accountant, a job that caused little stress and thus was perfect for me. I sat all day with my numbers and no one usually bothered me. Numbers I could fix. Numbers made sense. I needed that, since the rest of my life had always seemed unfixable and senseless. 

He told me he worked in tech, but didn’t elaborate. It was the Bay Area, where everyone worked in tech but few really loved it. He asked about my love life. I admitted I didn’t have one, that I *never* had one. I told him the sad truth. I’d had sex only a few times, and never with anyone I cared about; basically, to get it over with, so I could say I wasn’t a virgin and at least had some experience. He said he’d been with many women (which didn’t exactly reassure me), but now wanted to find “the one.” 

Then I told him the reason I was a *someone like me*. The epilepsy. I told him about how I’d basically given up, but turning thirty had triggered in me a desire to start living before it was too late. 

I said, “I never want to be a burden. Any guy who wants to be with me, it’s not always going to be easy. It’s kind of embarrassing. I’m not normal. I’m sorry.” 

He took my hand and squeezed lightly. “Don’t ever say that again. You’re extraordinary. I can tell. And hey, I’m not exactly perfect, either. I focus on one thing to a fault. I can be very intense when it comes to dating. I can be needy.”

“Nobody’s perfect,” I said.

We walked and talked past midnight. Time seemed abstract. We existed in our own pocket universe. As the date neared its end, we found ourself alone behind some trees at a small park near my building. He leaned in for a kiss, but I turned away at the last second. He was surprised, and almost seemed… angry, like he was desperate for my lips. Like he *needed* them. 

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to kiss him. I very much did. I was afraid the kiss would trigger a seizure as pleasure flooded my brain, and our wonderful night would end on a horrible note, ruining our potential future together. Sure, he said he was okay with my epilepsy, but saying it and meaning it are two different things. I needed him to know me better, to truly care about me before we kissed, before he saw me fall to the ground and suffer a grand mal seizure. It was too soon for him to see me as a needy spectacle. I quickly muttered a weak apology. 

“It’s okay, but now you’ll have to agree to another date. I hope you’re someone who kisses on the second date, because I don’t know if I can control myself much longer. I can sense how you feel about me.”

“I feel… all the things.” Maybe I wasn’t so bad at dating after all. This handsome man wanted me, and that was something I was not used to. Being the object of desire, being *wanted* - it was a high I’d never experienced. I was filled with new emotions, even love. Yes, already. 

*So this is what it feels like to be normal…*

At home after the date, I couldn’t wipe the smile off my face as my body hummed. I called Celina and gave her the details. 

“You little vixen!” she said, proud of me. 

We laughed like boy-crazy school girls. This was the me she’d been waiting for. The happy me. The hopeful me. The giddy me. We eventually hung up, and I went to sleep around 3am.

\* \* \* 

Throughout the next day, Mark sent me sweet text messages. I liked being a woman who received secret messages from a man at work. Thoughts of my nightmare faded quickly, replaced by tingling all over my body, by goosebumps, by arousal. 

*Thinking about you, May… You take me breath away… You’re more lovely than you even know… I miss you… I want to hold you tight and kiss you so hard I become part of you.*

Okay, that last one was a little weird, but I gave him an “A” for creativity.

\* \* \*

From the start, our second date felt different… off. I wanted to meet at a nice restaurant for dinner. Mark said he doesn’t really eat dinner. I suggested we go to a musical or a play, but Mark said he wanted to do something a bit more intimate. I suggested another walk, perhaps in the Castro this time, where we could check out the shops and scenery. “How about I come to your place?” We compromised. Scenic walk first, then a nightcap at my place. I didn’t want to invite him over so quickly, but I felt pressured. He was very persuasive. 

“What’s your greatest desire?” I asked, as we walked, holding hands. My hands were sweaty, his were dry and cold. 

The sun was setting beautifully behind us, an orange pink glow painting the landscape watercolor bright. 

“I have only one desire… to kiss you,” he said. What had on our first date come off as romantic was on our second date mildly creepy. 

He didn’t seem to have any great interest in anything other than me. He wasn’t a foodie; the man did not eat as far as I could tell. Hobbies? Nothing he felt the need to mention. Funny-slash-traumatic childhood stories? Not a single one. I’d shared the most embarrassing, soul-crushing moments from my life to Mark, but he offered nothing in return. I realized all during our long walks, I was doing all the talking, while he only smiled and listened. Granted, I had enough embarrassing stories to fill a book, but I needed *something* from him. 

As best as I could ascertain from a few tidbits of information, Mark was a privileged kid, well-off parents, went to private school, was popular and had many girlfriends. He started working in tech as a programmer, made a lot of money, and now just wanted to spend that money and find a partner.

I couldn’t fully trust a man who’d never struggled, a man who’d never felt pain or embarrassment. He’d never understand me – my shame, my anger, my self-loathing, my isolation. He was never mocked, never pitied, never felt like a *someone like me*. He was that good-looking guy we all knew who always got what he wanted, and all he had to do was smile.  

Mark was gorgeous, a snazzy dresser, and perhaps better than I deserved. But he was not the man for me. I wanted struggle and desire, not money and surface. It was a hard pill to swallow – that this attractive man who actually wanted me was not the right guy. But still, swallow it I did. Whatever love for him I felt on that first date was now gone. I needed to be honest with him. I wasn’t feeling it, and we weren’t going to last. I need a guy with a better personality, but how do you tell a guy that? I had never in my life been close to dumping a guy. I’d barely ever even *had* a guy. 

Somehow, we ended up at my apartment door, and I was getting nervous as the faulty hallway lights flickered in my shitty building. I didn’t want to invite him in. I wanted to go inside and have a good cry. But how could I turn him away without pissing him off? 

“You know, I’m feeling pretty crappy. My meds… it’s a whole big thing. Let’s call it a night, okay?” I offered a weak smile and hoped he’d leave me to my misery. 

He did not.  

“Let me in. I’ll make you feel better,” he said. “I promise I’ll take all your pain away.”

“No, thanks. We’ll chat tomorrow.” 

“I don’t want to say goodbye. I don’t ever want to say goodbye.”

Plan B. I gave him a quick hug and tried to sneak into my apartment and close the door. Before I could turn the key, he grabbed me, pulled me to him, an odd, twisted smile on his face. A smile like a pod person. Like something not human doing its best human impression. Like the Uncanny Valley made real. 

“No kiss?” he asked. His smile grew bigger, more sinister. He moved closer. I shoved him back and then…

I entered my hazy dream world. A world of auras and tendrils and souls and undiscovered colors. In my haze, I saw Mark extending toward me. I didn’t see a good soul or a bad soul. I saw no soul.  

Mark was not a man. Not human. My hazy dream world had revealed his true form.

A monster. A *thing*. Its mouth like a tiny black hole, trying to suck me inside. Its face made of puss and jagged teeth and blood and entrails and tiny things that crawl out from under rocks. Its eyes big and red and wet, like two little burning pools. Its body like a living Frankenstein sculpture made of skinless demons. 

I screamed. 

Mark was stunned. “You… see me?” This time, its voice didn’t even try to sound human. This time, it sounded like it was talking through broken glass.

“Yes, you’re a monster!" 

It grabbed my hand. I fought until I couldn’t, fought until the seizure overtook me. Until I fell to the ground and shook violently. 

Then its mouth opened wide and a strange sort of spider crawled out. A spider the size of a rat, with human eyes, baby eyes. It crawled into my mouth. I gagged. My wide eyes watered. And then it was inside me. I could feel it moving around inside my stomach. It felt warm and oddly comforting. 

And then… I was fine. My seizure immediately stopped. 

“I see you, too,” it said. 

It… *he*… saw me. And I saw him.

 He was a *someone like me*. 

I stood up and looked at Mark. He was beautiful. I kissed him, then took his hand and led him into my apartment. A part of him was inside me, and inside me it would stay. And I was never lonely again.
