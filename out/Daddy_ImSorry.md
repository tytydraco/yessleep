Let me begin with something close to me that I’ve never been able to understand myself and express clearly to anyone.

My daddy is my superhero; I remember when he bought home the game that cost almost INR 2000 back in the day to see the smile on my face. It was special because I loved the game, and looking at the price, we decided it was beyond the budget, so I started making a prototype myself at home with cardboard and glue. When cutting holes in the cardboard, I remember the doorbell ringing and seeing him holding a packet from the store. I got so excited that I started jumping all around with and hugging him. This is my last memory of hugging him without someone asking me to do so.

He was the one who motivated me to learn how to cycle for as long as possible so I didn’t hurt myself. Even when I fell, I remember him being soft and harsh at the same time. I worried that I didn’t hurt myself too much and being harsh that I didn’t stop learning how to cycle after a minor setback. He believed in learning from mistakes, and at the same time, experience is the best teacher. He had a proper mix in him, and I do not know how he built it, but he was exceptional.

He knew studying was the way to move forward and stressed a lot on that front for me. He would buy books like crazy and ensure I had access to every book I had eyes on or that he thought was good learning. He would motivate me to prepare for olympiads, competitions and other hobby groups for an all-round development. He taught me how to draw for the first time, what colour shades to use, and how to make the picture look realistic. I remember that I had drawn g during my kindergarten days and was sent to represent my school in the city. The same picture again won me the top prize. I’m so grateful for the picture, Daddy!

We didn’t have much money growing up, but my daddy knew how much I liked bikes and cars, and back in 2008, when we got our bikes, we would use them cautiously so we wouldn’t waste money on fuel. Yet, whenever I would tell him, he would take me for a ride so I could enjoy the wind in my hair.

Once in school, a senior had put gum in my hair, so I had to get my hair trimmed. My dad ensured the person had to pay for it and talked to the school and the student so such incidents do not repeat and I’m not bullied further.

Once, in our building, a senior bullied me and struck me for no reason. He even held me and prevented me from going home. I somehow ran away from him, but the bully caught me again. My daddy had gone on a business trip, and the next day, when he came back, I told him about the incident; he got furious but remained calm. It was our ritual to go for badminton every evening, so we did it this time as well, and when he saw the guy playing down, my daddy went and slapped the senior right then in front of his parents and said this is for touching my son and slapped a second time and said, this is for messing with my family.

Once he had tried his venture, it failed, and the family had no income for a few years (almost 5 years). This is why we didn’t go on any family vacation. For the first time, my school was taking us out of state for a trip, and without hesitation, he said go for it. He didn’t ask for the price and just said you’re taking the cheque and go for it. I knew that bank statements were drying, which didn’t sound right. I didn’t submit the cheque to the school registrar, and the next day, my daddy came to school and paid for it himself. It was a costly trip for just 5 days, yet he wanted me to be refreshed, so he asked me to go for it.

I got so good at talking, gained courage, and structured my thoughts because of him. I remember clearly that I used to be one of the best orators in my school, thanks to my daddy. He would help me gather facts about the topic, help me structure my speech, help me practice it again and again till I could say it confidently, listen to me every time I spoke and finally give me comments. After a certain point, the drill was so ingrained in me that I came off naturally. I became smooth at preparing the speeches and understanding what quotes to use and when to use them.

While preparing for undergraduate school, he put me for the best education. No matter how expensive things were, he would pay for them. Mind you, I studied in the most expensive places. I come from one of the most expensive cities in India, and even in this city, the academic classes that I chose were at least 5–10 more expensive than the regular ones. He wanted me to study well and have a bright future for myself. Things were going amazingly well until everything fell during the lockdown covid-19.

He was the best daddy I could’ve asked for. He used to be so busy with his calls that he would skip dinner and be late for lunch, even on Sundays, because of his meetings, but whenever I needed him, he was always available. This is the father I had, but I am very sorry because I couldn’t be the son anyone would want.

Like everyone else, my daddy had issues with his temper. He would lash out in anger, and this was his drawback. Sometimes, he would physically assault my mother, and it was not all right. There was a lot of family drama and some past, which had caused my parents emotional and mental trauma. My daddy didn’t overcome it healthily, and violence is what he would resort to. Not every day he would hit my mother, but once in 2–3 months if I even remember correctly. Never in life did he hit me, and to me, he was always sweet and caring, but the history between my mother and daddy got the better of him.

During lockdown, he would get angry, and whenever he would try to hit my mother, I would raise my voice. He would tell me to stay out of this. Once, I even hit him for hitting my mother, and a big fight broke out. These fights started getting frequent, where I would hit my daddy, and he would hit me back. Once, I hit him so bad he had to get stitches near his eyes, and it was a severe injury.

He was such a sweetheart that we were going on a vacation the next day, and we could’ve cancelled as we hadn’t paid anything yet; he gave us the silent treatment and took us for the vacation.

My arrogance got the better of me, and I would hit my daddy, not just in the situations when he hit my mother but also in situations when he would raise his voice against me. I thought I was the most powerful person in the room and everyone should listen to me. I broke many things at home, such as glasses, chairs, dining tables, vessels, utensils, fridge, you name it. All in the name of retaliatory action, but it was my temper and arrogance. At times, my neighbours would come home and stop the fight.

I don’t remember those few months anymore; it feels like a dark spot in my history, and I do not wish to revisit it ever again. Sometimes, the fight between daddy and mom also got intense, and he was used to getting hit by me, and the situation at home was not so great. My mother and I moved out of the house and lived with my maternal grandparents, where I started isolating myself, not talking to either my mother or my daddy and just sitting and studying and working. This was not a sustainable way to live, but I did it anyway. Looking at me my parents took me to therapy, and my counsellor has helped me a lot. She helped me understand that not everything is under my control and that I need to be more grateful for what I have. Violence is never an option, and my action is my choice.

Luckily, I had been admitted to a college away from home, and my parents had moved to a different country for work. Their issues were resolved when my daddy stopped hitting my mother, and I became very calm and am no longer that angry person.

I feel sad that the last 5 years made me very distant from my parents, and I had become a child that no parent would ever want. My daddy, especially Wo, would never want to talk to me after all the nasty things I would tell him and the physical pain that I caused him. I have never been able to heal the emotional pain that I caused him, and I do not know how to talk to him about this. He is soft and gentle, and I want to get closer to them again. I know my parents are getting old, and I need to spend time with them, but now that I’ve started my career, I will hardly have time for them. I may never have time to live with them again, and the worst of all, to make things right with them and to apologise to my parents for not being the child they would’ve wanted when they held me in the hospital after my birth.

I’m sorry, Daddy, please forgive me. I will try to come close to you. Please allow me to come closer to you and understand you all again.
