If ever you visit Brisbane City during the holiday season, there’s something you need to be aware of. I’m still not exactly sure what these things are, I don’t think anybody is. There are, of course, things that exist in this world which escape any traditional explanation, I’m certain none of us who frequent this corner of the internet would object to that truth.

Anyway, I’m drifting a little off track. I guess you all came here to read a story, yeah? As the title may suggest, I was recently in Brisbane City over the month of December. For those of you not from this part of the world, Brisbane is one of Australia’s quieter capital cities. It’s essentially a well developed central business district, surrounded by an overgrown small town. The city itself is absolutely beautiful at Christmas time. The streets come alive with the festive colours of the season. Wreaths are hung, tinsel lines the quaint alleyways and arcades, and performers dressed as beautiful angels and fairies dance around the central Queen Street Mall.

This central area is where I was staying during Christmas. I was here to visit family, you know the drill, that one time of year to suck it up and endure the presence of people you love dearly, but really don’t like all that much. My mind was already turning through pages of unpleasant memories like a picture book. An entirely disgusting Christmas lunch cooked by Aunty Joanna here, an infamous fist fight or two between my many cousins there, and me, stuck in the middle of this chaos every December 25th. The things we do for family.

It was the 23rd when I got the phone call. My phone erupted into an ear piercing buzz on the table where it sat, rudely interrupting my terrible pay per view movie I had begrudgingly shelled out for. Glancing down at the screen I sighed as my eyes landed upon my cousin Paula’s name. She was hard work at the best of times, forever entertaining the most unwilling participants with one sided conversations about her latest cat or some nonsense which had exited my mind no sooner had she forced it into my ears.

*“Yeah? Hello?”* I grumbled into the handset, trying to give the impression I was on the cusp of sleep. A futile attempt to hurry the conversation along.

*“Jake! It’s Paula! How are you?!”* She excitedly sang back at me. Hmm, seems my strategy had fallen on deaf ears.

*“Ah, yeah I’m doing okay. Excited to see you guys in a couple of days. So what’s up?”*, I said, trying desperately to make this exchange as brief as possible. It didn’t work. I was graced with tales of literal tails for a good half hour or so before she finally got to the point, letting me know that she would be bringing her newest love interest and his two children to Christmas lunch, and it would be nice if everybody could bring a small gift for the two little girls so they don’t feel left out. Jesus Christ. Why is this my problem? I, of course, didn’t say that. None of this is the kids’ fault, and it sounds like their home life isn’t great. Never had a stable partner come into Paula’s life, I’m certain this would be no exception.

So, at 9pm at night I found myself pulling on my jeans and joggers ready to head back down to the mall in search of a gift or two. I suppose I could have waited until morning, I probably should have in hindsight, but Christmas Eve was absolute madness in the middle of Brisbane City. People heading out at the last minute to buy Christmas gifts they’d made zero plans for the rest of the 363 days of the year, and of course that is entirely your fault should you dare to get in their way.

As if to test me, the second I stepped foot outside my hotel and breathed in a big gulp of crisp river city air, I was accosted by a homeless man shouting in my face. I tried to simply walk away but he followed, screaming at me, “Please! Please!”. Look, I’m always willing to give when I can, but I only had $50 notes on me, which I really couldn’t spare, so side stepping him once again I simply apologised and wished him the best, before moving on. I kept one eye on him, as he skulked off into a back alley up the street a ways. You never know when drugs might be involved, and how that might affect a person’s behaviour. So best to stay alert.

Slowly, I made my way down Edward Street toward Queen Street, keeping a sharp mental focus on the alley behind me. I must admit, that guy got to me a little. I’m in the city frequently so I’m not too rattled by encounters like this, but there was something quite manic in his eyes. I didn’t like it. Other than that though, it was a rather quiet night. The promise of rain seemed to hang just out of reach, the cloud cover darkening the streets making for a scene eerily similar to something straight out of Gotham. I always loved the city, something about the calm yet somewhat chaotic ambience just soothed me in a way that’s probably foreign to most of my country dwelling acquaintances, particularly these night walks. Just the sound of your footsteps along with those typical urban sounds, a siren in the distance, wind howling through the looming buildings, the faint hum of engines as traffic endlessly droned across the nearby road bridges.

Before long, the opening to Queen Street Mall was in sight. I was a little taken aback at first, noting the place was quite a bit busier than I anticipated it would have been at this time of night. Late night shopping hours in the lead up to Christmas seemed to have attracted many more people than usual. It’s all good, I reasoned, I’d be in and out pretty quick. It couldn’t be too hard to hunt down something a couple of kids could play with for a few hours Christmas Day. I made my way toward the Uptown shopping centre, and stepped onto the escalator. As I did so, I heard an enormous racket behind me, children screaming, and parents shouting. I spun around to see a group of kids running frantically down the middle of the mall’s main thoroughfare. Of course, it was one of the fairy godmother stilt walkers. They occasionally will… “chase” people around. I never really understood why, thought it was all just a bit of fun. The kids didn’t seem to think so though, they honestly looked terrified. Who can blame them I guess, some 10 foot tall woman comes lumbering after you in the mall at night, what’s a kid that age supposed to think? Would have scared me to death were I still an innocent 10 year old boy.

I left all that commotion behind me, entering the shopping centre and making a bee line for the nearby Target. As I made my way through the centre, I noticed that the shops were all beginning to pull down their roller doors. Looks like I got here just in time. Checking my watch, I was surprised to see the hour hand ticking its way ever closer to 10pm. I didn’t think I took that long walking down here. I began to hustle, wanting to get in and out of Target as quickly as I could and get back to the hotel. I was getting a weird vibe in the city tonight, first from that run in with the homeless guy, and now as more and more shops began to pull down their doors and shut off their lights for the night, I was beginning to feel a little vulnerable. I couldn’t quite put my finger on why, I was getting that… “emptiness” feeling. Have you ever looked at pictures of liminal spaces and come across those typical images of abandoned shopping centres? That was the vibe I was getting. I jumped a little, as a nearby shoe store suddenly slammed its doors down with a mighty crash which echoed through the mall’s seemingly deserted twists and turns. I quickened my pace. I was starting to feel trapped, and it was making me very uncomfortable. I couldn’t shake this sudden feeling that I might somehow get stuck in here.

Finally, after what felt like forever traipsing through these dimly lit halls, I found the Target, an oasis of bright lights among these quickly darkening passageways. I made my way inside and ran through to the kids section. It was literally a couple of minutes until close now, so I didn’t waste time tossing up options. I grabbed a few books that looked like they might be interesting to kids, and picked up a little princess toy set on my way back to the front of the store. Hearing the sounds of yet more roller doors squeaking their way down, I headed straight for the checkouts. I walked a little faster now, as the lights in the store began shutting off one by one. It gave me that weird feeling again, it made me feel so very small, like a mouse trying to make his way out of a maze. What was particularly odd is the place really did feel like it was deserted. There were a few other people here and there, but nothing like the crowds I had anticipated. Every so often I’d catch sight of a fellow shopper, darting their way between the aisles. So I wasn’t the only one here, but still, it felt like I was.

*BOOM…*

A dull electrical impact from above me, as another of the store’s overhead fluorescent lights shut off behind me.

*BOOM…*

And another, I was practically running to the checkouts now, sweat forming on my face. Something wasn’t right.

*BOOM…*

Darkness. I was standing in absolute darkness, entirely alone… in the middle of a Target store in the busiest shopping centre in Brisbane City. No way, this was wrong. This was very, very wrong. As if reading my mind, I heard a crackle coming out of the tiny speakers in the ceiling above me, as a soft spoken, cheery voice came across the store’s intercom system.

*“Good evening shoppers, the store is now closed. We hope you have had a wonderful shopping experience with us tonight. Please bring any remaining purchases to the checkouts so we may complete your transactions. We pray you get home safely”.*

Okay… that was odd. Well, the entire situation was odd, but “pray you get home safely”? It almost sounded threatening. Anyway, I was done with this. Absolutely and totally done. I made my way to the checkouts area, which were also now in complete darkness, save for a tiny flickering blue light above. They really don’t mess around come closing time. I approached the one remaining open checkout, a small self serve unit, and began scanning my items.

*Beep…*

The sound seemed to echo through the looming halls outside.

*Beep…*

I glanced up, looking down the gaping maw that awaited me. I had this feeling I couldn’t shake. Like something might crawl out of there, trying to get me.

*Beep…*

Around a corner, the faint rattle of a door came rolling around through the darkness.

*Beep…*

My anxiety was heightening with every beep that rang out. I couldn’t take this anymore!

*Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!*

The checkout started making an absolute racket! Oh screw this, I am out! I grabbed the rest of my stuff, pulled a $50 note out of my pocket and threw it onto the checkout, leaving one of the books to keep it weighted down. I wasn’t sticking around any longer. I shoved my things into a bag and got the hell out of there, breaking into a swift power walk toward the exit. As I walked, one quick step at a time, the ominous ambience of a dead shopping mall in the silence of the night emanated around me. Distant footsteps, faint buzzing from the remaining dull lights. Every so often I’d hear some voices in the distance, shouting or laughing, the sounds bouncing their way around the centre. After a minute or two of this, I finally caught sight of the exit, and broke into a jogging pace straight for it.

That feeling of fresh air on my skin, is one of the best sensations I have ever felt. As I clanged my way down the now deactivated escalator, I swore to myself that this was the last time I was ever going to chance shopping at night. Something about what happened in there was not right at all. Beyond just being creeped out about being stuck in the centre alone, it felt like something more, something I couldn’t place, but it touched on a primal part of my brain. Anyway, I was out, and all was fine.

I slowly strolled my way down the now devoid of life Queen Street Mall. It’s like a fever dream in the early mornings or late hours, a stark contrast to what is usually a bustling tourist hot spot. As I walked, I noted the sounds and the smells around me, no longer surrounded by the crushing emptiness of that damned shopping centre, but instead the peaceful ambience of the night. I noted the calls of the many nocturnal animals that lived in the city’s parklands, the breeze whistling through the streets and alleyways, which felt nice on an otherwise warm summer’s night, and the soft lapping of the Brisbane River, a sound which could be heard blocks away when the city was quiet enough.

It was perhaps because of this calming atmosphere that I was not alarmed at first, when I looked up ahead and noticed that a few of the mall’s Christmas performers were still out and about. They were merely sillouhettes at my distance from them, but I could make out a group of kids, and two or three of the stilt walkers still up and about doing their routines. It gave me a chuckle at first, they were very committed to their bit! However, it was when one of the stilt walkers broke away from the group, lumbering away from the others in a wide turning circle, before walking down towards me, that I decided to take an alternative route. I get it’s fun for kids, or parents shopping with their children, but the whole “chasing” thing was not something I wanted to be dealing with at 10:30pm at night.

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

The stilt walker continued her slow approach in my direction, as I made a swift left turn down an open laneway. I just wanted to get back to the hotel already. This night had been so… weird.

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

The footsteps of the stilt walker continued behind me, as I heard her slapping her way past the small opening of the laneway, and disappearing beyond. I was nearing the opening to Elizabeth Street when I heard it again.

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

From the other side this time. What the hell was she doing? And why? This “joke” was going too far. I doubled back, making my way back toward the mall. As I passed by a little ramen joint about halfway through the laneway, I noticed the owner was still there. He was just standing there, staring out at me from behind the closed shutter. There was a look in his eyes, similar to that homeless man I had encountered earlier in the night, almost manic, yet a hint of concern. As soon as I caught his eyes, he turned away, disappearing into the back room. I don’t know what it was, but that small exchange got my heart racing, and I began walking much faster toward the opening back to the mall. I was nearing the exit, ready to emerge and literally run back to my hotel when…

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

Again. Another one. Yes, more than one now. One behind me, and one right in front of me. I turned back again. I know, I know, it’s just a stilt walker you might say, I should have just run past her and gotten out of there if I was scared. But that’s the thing, I ***was*** scared! I didn’t even know why at the time. I just didn’t want to go out there with that thing. I made my way back through the laneway for a third time, stopping midway and pushing on a little white doorway, hoping it would take me elsewhere… anywhere…

*Shuffle shuffle shuffle…*

***In*** the laneway now, coming down toward me. I pushed the door open and shoved my way inside, not caring exactly where this would lead. As I entered into what I now saw was a narrow stairwell, I caught a glimpse in my peripheral of the stilt walker wobbling from side to side as she made her way slowly toward me. “Why? Why can’t they just stop?”, I thought to myself. I slammed the door, and began climbing up the stairwell, no idea where I was headed, but just happy that it was away from those things.

*Slap… slap… slap…*

A different sound now, equally as unsettling though. I made my way to the top of the stairs and opened another door, one that lead into a small office style room. The truth is I was equally nervous about who’s space I might be trespassing upon, but in the moment it just felt like the lesser of two dangers. Feeling my way around the room in the darkness, carefully ensuring I didn’t trip over anything, I made my way to the far wall and took a peak out the small glass window. I cracked it open a little, and poked my head out just enough to get a good look up and down Elizabeth Street. Nothing. The streets were empty, just the distant hum of traffic elsewhere in the city, and the pitter patter of the rain that had been teasing me earlier in the night. It smelled nice, and the calming sounds of little droplets hitting the pavement had me almost relaxed again.

*Slap… slap… slap slap slap… slap slap slap slap slap!*

That sound, this time much faster. I pulled away from the window and I squeezed myself into a corner of the room, wedged between the side of a locker and the concrete wall it stood by. I planned to wait it out. Honestly, even if I had to wait all night, I didn’t care. I wasn’t taking another step outside with those stilt walkers. They were acting crazy now, and I had no idea why. It had gone far beyond a joke. So, I waited there, in the stillness of the night. I stood there, for hours and hours, eventually sliding down the wall to sit, and letting my head rest against the steel locker beside me, drifting between that almost asleep state and back again, wondering how the hell my otherwise boring night had ended up here.

It must have been the early hours of the morning when I was pulled from my sleepy state. It took me a while to figure out what had disrupted me, and why I felt so uneasy when I awoke fully. It’s a strange thing, the human mind, when confronted by fear it will often try anything to reason the situation, or distract itself. The first thing I completely took notice of was the sounds. The rain still gently fell outside, and I noted the drops trickling down the windows, pooling into little puddles at the base. I registered the sound of the wind picking up in strength as it blew back and forth down the dark and wet city streets. I suppose it wasn’t until I dropped the bag containing the little princess play set I was holding onto, and the sound of the many components clattering across the floor startled me into consciousness, that I snapped into full awareness of my surroundings.

It was staring right at me.

Just me… and it. In this little room. Not 2 meters between each other’s faces. It was hunched. Its back bent over, clearly visible even in the darkness outside. Its stretched neck was sliding part way in through the glass window I had opened earlier, to the point that its head was now partly inside with me. These were not stilt walkers. Here I sat, at least 3 storeys up, in total silence, as this thing silently stared at me, its neck swaying back and forth in the wind outside, causing subtle squeaking sounds on the glass.

I tried to close my eyes, but I could not keep them closed. Every second that my eyes were shut I would imagine it sliding its neck further in through the window.

*Squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

The glass groaned, as its filthy neck slid back and forth against it. I began to slide my way across the floor, very slowly, trying to make my way to the door. The problem was, the massive office desk sat between me and the door, with a hardwood divider right behind it. I would need to move closer to the window in order to make my way out.

*Slide… drag… slide… drag…*

Inch by inch. With every subtle movement I made, its eyes stayed locked on me, and it released these awful, deep laughing sounds. Not loud and booming like you may expect, but rather quiet. Almost like a child’s laughter, if you recorded it and pitched it down a few semitones. With every slide toward the door, I came a little closer to the window… closer to it. Its neck would spasm as I inched closer, like it was trying to reach its face just a little bit nearer to me.

*Slide… drag… squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

At this point I felt like bursting into tears. I was midway across the room now, in front of that huge office desk, and our faces were mere inches apart. The glass squeaked louder now, as its neck slid back and forth against the thin barrier between us, with every brush, the glass began to groan a little more, threatening to crack.

*Slide… drag… squeak… squueeeeaaaakkkkk…*

I was less than half a meter away from the doorway, when the first visible crack started to appear in the glass window, as its neck shook and vibrated. The rain continued to fall outside, and the wind continued to howl. The world, so peaceful, in a terrifying contrast to what was happening in front of me. It laughed again, an almost silent little chuckle, as it snapped its head backwards, realising that the glass was giving out. My hand reached the doorknob and turned it open just as the glass broke away, a stray shard piercing into that twisted neck with an audible squish.

Just as I opened the door and slipped through, slamming it shut behind me, I heard this thing begin to cry, almost as though it was sobbing and laughing simultaneously. Again, childlike in nature, but deep and guttural. As I made my way down the stairs, quickly, but being careful not to make more noise than I had to, I heard a strange brushing sound against the door behind me, like scratching, but damp and wet. I shuddered, as I imagined a tongue stretching out from that awful mouth.

This time, I did not hesitate, emerging from that alleyway I ran out into the dark, rainy streets. There was no relief in my flight. With every step the image of something massive following close behind me was present in my mind. I was acutely aware that at any moment an all too large hand may clasp around me, raising me to my demise. And of course, the sounds were there to confirm my fears.

*Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap! Slap!*

The distant sound of something barefoot running through the mall. After me? I did not know. Nor was I going to chance looking to find out. I ran back to my hotel, taking every shortcut I was aware of. Arriving at the front lobby I slammed my card against the reader and flew in through the doors, grabbing the first elevator up to the 12th floor I was staying on, where I hoped beyond hope that I would be safe. I admit my haste was selfish, should I have warned the staff at the front desk? Maybe. I guess I’ll never know if I made the right choice. Who in their right mind would believe the ramblings of a man who had just witnessed what I had?

The elevator dinged at my floor, and I ran to the assumed safety of my room. I swiftly made my way to the window and flung open the curtains. I suppose this is the point of the story where one might neatly close things out by explaining that nothing of interest could be seen, that I didn’t know if it was imagined or real, and never will. How I wish I could sit here and tell you this. For what I saw was very real, and no doubt remained in my mind. There were many of them. Tall, impossible things, blundering up and down the mall, and the streets and laneways beyond. They appeared just as the thing I had encountered did. Almost innocent in their nature, even childish. I sat there and watched them all night. As the hours crept towards 5am or so, I watched, flabbergasted, as these things began to shrink. What had been giants, suddenly were a fraction of their size, yet still, quite tall. Maybe… 10 feet if I had to guess.

It fell into place then. The stilt walkers. Performers they were not. Or, they were, I mean that’s what they were masquerading as. But I knew now those were not their true forms, not their true faces. As night fell, they became something else. I thought back to the many times I had seen these things chasing people, chasing kids through the mall. I thought back to earlier in the night, when I first caught sight of these things, there had been many children among them. Were they kids who had been captured? Spirited away? I dare not think of it.

There are still things I don’t understand, and many questions I’ll never have answers to. But the realities here remain, and you would do well to heed my warnings. STAY AWAY FROM QUEEN STREET MALL AFTER DARK. In fact, just to be safe, the minute you hear those shops rolling down their doors at closing time, LEAVE! Get yourself back home. Get on a bus, I don’t care where it’s headed. Just get as far away from that damned place as you can.

You don’t want to find yourself alone in those desolate, abandoned streets… when The Talls come [out.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1hc8ay2/my_stories_master_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
