Youth is wasted on the young.

I always thought that was a stupid saying… until I got old. Looking back on my younger years, I wasted so much time. Gave two years of my beauty and youth to a guy who was emotionally abusive. Spent nights alone in my room, listening to music, when I could’ve been out there meeting someone. You don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone, I guess.

And it was gone. Well, almost. 37 years old. Time slipping through my fingers. A flower starting to wilt.

But then I met Whitney.

Whitney was 8 months older than me. And yet, she looked like she was 29. Acted like it, too—she was the “fun” one, bringing youthful enthusiasm to our mom group while the rest of us gulped coffee down by the gallon and looked like zombies. I couldn’t figure out how she did it all. How she stayed so thin, how her face looked so beautiful, how she had the energy of someone just out of college.

One day, I brought my son over for a playdate, and while they were playing video games upstairs I asked her.

“How do you do it?” I asked, sipping on a tea. “You have like twice the energy I do. And you look *amazing.”*

She let out a little giggle. “All about moisturizing,” she said, “and drinking lots of water.”

“*Moisturize meeee,”* I replied, imitating that centuries-old character from Doctor Who. She laughed. “But seriously. That’s all it is? If I drink a gallon of water a day and buy some face cream, I’ll look like you?”

Okay. I admit, I was subtly trying to get her to admit she’d gotten work done. Or that she had a full-time nanny while she slept ten hours a day. Because it wasn’t fair. Standing next to each other, I looked like I had ten years on her. And if it was really Botox that worked its wonders, hell, maybe I’d give it a try.

“Okay, I’ll let you in on a little secret.”

*I knew it.* I leaned forward eagerly, waiting for her to spill.

Except there’s no way I could’ve predicted the words that came out of her mouth.

“It’s because of The Porcelain Lady.”

I frowned. When she didn’t elaborate, I asked, “What, that’s like some beauty salon or something?”

She smiled and shook her head. “No.”

I sat there, confused. But then it dawned on me. “The Porcelain Lady” sounded like it could be a euphemism for a drug. Like “Molly” and “Mary Jane” are. Now that I thought about it, wasn’t using women’s names for drugs kind of sexist?

“Oh. It’s a drug,” I whispered.

“I guess you could call it that,” she said, still smiling.

*What’s that supposed to mean? Either it’s a drug, or it isn’t.* But I took her response as being coy. As a little wink and nod, a subtle signal that I was supposed to pick up on, that *yes, it’s a drug, but I’m too much of a lady to admit I’m actually doing drugs.*

“If you’re interested, I can hook you up!”

Dread settled in my stomach. I’d never, *ever* done drugs. Not even weed. They kind of… scared me, to be honest. Like, what if I murdered someone because the drugs made me thing it was a rabid dog attacking me? What if it’s like *Oculus,* where you don’t know what’s real and fake and you kill a whole bunch of people based on your own perception of things?

“Sorry, I don’t really… do… drugs,” I said, lamely.

“Oh, no, it’s not a *drug* drug,” she said. “I just meant that… well, nevermind. You’re not interested.” She waved her hand away.

“No! I *am* interested.”

“Okay. How about this. Why don’t you come over tonight, after dinner? I can tell you all about everything, and you can decide whether or not it’s right for you.”

“Um… okay? I guess I can do that.”

But just when I was getting excited, she said something that sucked all the air out of my lungs.

“You know, you can even make money with this. I know a couple who retired at 30!”

*Oh no.*

*It’s an MLM.*

Multi-level marketing. Pyramid scheme. I swallowed—if I showed up tonight, it would probably be a three-hour presentation on how to sell some beauty cream on Facebook. And how I had to pay two hundred bucks for the starter kit.

But.

Whitney looked *so* beautiful across the table from me. Blue eyes sparkling, not a single wrinkle on her face. Body rail thin, like she could land a modeling job this instant. Maybe this product… cream, diet pill, whatever… actually *worked.*

“I’ll see you after dinner. Around 8?”

“That’s perfect,” she replied, shooting me a show-stopping smile.

\*\*\*

I did some Googling at home. But nothing came up for “The Porcelain Lady.” Which was weird, because most beauty MLMs are all over Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. I mean, if there isn’t a Facebook group you can invite random high school acquaintances to, is it even an MLM?

I drove over at ten ‘til. When I pulled into the driveway, though, Whitney’s house was mostly dark. *Maybe she forgot we were going to meet up,* I thought. But as soon as I got up to the door, it swung open and she gave me a big hug.

But when I stepped in… things seemed a little off.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Like spices or potpourri or something, but not in a good way. It was like sweet cinnamon and fresh pine and punchy cayenne all mixed together in a cake no one would eat.

*Oh no. This better not be some essential oils crap.*

Frowning, I followed her into the dining room. But, surprisingly, I didn’t see any sort of display set up on the table. There was just a single tealight candle, flickering brightly in the dark house.

“Why don’t you sit?” Whitney asked, taking a seat at the table.

“Oh, um, okay.”

I sat across from her—and a chill went down my spine.

Whitney’s face, lit in the harsh shadows of the candlelight, didn’t look so pretty anymore. Deep shadows seeped into her eye sockets and the hollows of her cheeks, flickering and dancing as if her face were morphing before my eyes.

“Now, I want you to close your eyes…” she said, closing her own and taking a deep breath, “and imagine the end of your life.”

“… What?”

“Imagine. You’re almost 80 years old. It’s hard to get out of bed. Your joints ache, all your friends are gone, and your skin looks like a shriveled prune.”

I stared at her.

“You’re not closing your eyes!” she said in a sing-song voice, as she took a peek at me.

“Um. Okay.” I closed my eyes, even though it made me uncomfortable.

“How valuable are those last ten years? When everything you ever had is gone? Health, love, beauty. All gone.” She took in another deep breath. “Are they even worth living?”

I was well acquainted with the fear-mongering, predatory tactics of MLMs. Body-shaming plus size women, telling them they’ll never attract another man, unless they buy some pill or cream. Telling moms their children are surrounded by toxins, but essential oils will magically block them. *Buy this or your life will suck/your kids will die/everything will go kaboom* is a tried-and-true method for MLMs.

“I guess those years are still worth living,” I said, still keeping my eyes shut. “I mean, I want to meet my grandkids, if I have any. And just… more time would be nice, even if I’m old. Even just watching TV or someth—”

“Okay, but what if you could trade them for something in return?” Whitney said, interrupting me. “Would you, for example, trade those last ten years, to be youthful for ten more years?”

*What is she getting at? Does the pill or cream or whatever cause cancer or something?* I was about to ask for clarification—when I heard a *thump* from behind me.

My eyes shot open.

My gaze immediately snapped onto the mirror, mounted on the opposite wall. And with horror, I realized there was someone there. Standing behind me.

At first, I only saw the face. Bone-white, starkly contrasting with the darkness. Then I saw the rest of them, and with horror, I realized they were wearing a mask. The white color of their face didn’t match their skin.

*Oh God. They’re going to rob me, or murder me, or something.*

I shot up and ran to the door. Surprisingly, Whitney didn’t shout at me, or try to grab me and pull me back. I wrapped my fingers around the doorknob and pulled—

*No.*

The door was locked.

I scanned the locks. But there was some sort of lock with a keyhole, that she must’ve locked when I wasn’t looking. I turned around, heart pounding. “Let me out.”

“You have to meet the Porcelain Lady,” Whitney replied, gesturing towards the figure that was steady approaching through the darkness behind us. She appeared to be a woman, wearing a tattered dress—but very tall. It was unlikely I could take both of them on.

Whitney grinned at me. “She can give you youth. Isn’t that what you want?”

*She’s batshit insane.* “If you don’t let me out, I’m calling the cops,” I breathed.

“How?” She reached into her pocket… and with a grin, pulled out *my* phone.

My throat went dry. I turned to the window. The houses across the street had lights on. I pounded my fist against the glass. “Fire! *Fire!”* I screamed, knowing that was more effective than shouting help.

But there were two layers of glass and an entire street between me and them. No one seemed to notice. Nothing happened. I whipped around.

The figure, the ‘porcelain lady’ I guess, was standing right behind Whitney now.

And that’s when I realized there was something terribly off about her.

Her skin. Even in the low light I could tell it had a grayish, bluish hue to it. Like she’d been dead for weeks. And there were these things—these dark lines, almost like cracks, spiderwebbing across her arms, up her collarbone, up to her jawline where they disappeared under the mask.

Like her skin itself began to shatter.

But her mask was pristine. The features were dainty and smooth, expressionless and perfect, like a mannequin’s. And its pure white color, the way it glinted in the candlelight…

It looked like porcelain.

She’d stopped now. Right behind Whitney. She stared out at me through those almond-shaped eyeholes, bottomless voids of pitch black.

“Are you ready to make the deal?” Whitney asked me, with manic glee.

I stared at both of them. I was trapped. The Porcelain Lady tilted her head as she examined me, but did not step forward.

“Okay… I’ll make the deal,” I said slowly, eyes flitting back and forth between them. “Ten years of my life for youth, right? I’ll look twenty again?”

Whitney nodded.

“Okay. Okay, I’m in,” I said, nodding, smiling. Trying to sell the lie. I stood there—and then I dashed to the left, towards the living room.

I sprinted through the darkness, towards the back door. I didn’t even know if they were coming after me or not—my blood was pulsing in my ears, and all I could focus on was the singular goal of, *I have to get out of here, or I’m going to die.* I darted into the kitchen—and when I saw that same lock on the door, I ran to the nearest window and yanked it open.

Surprisingly, there was no extra lock. I reeled my knee back and prepared to kick out the screen—

A cold hand grabbed mine. My entire body spun backwards, away from the window. My head bobbed on my neck and I saw the room, spinning around me—

The Porcelain Lady.

Her face, in my vision.

Except her white mask of porcelain had been distorted. Stretched. Her mouth was a gaping wide hole, a black abyss, large enough to fit my entire head. I screamed and thrashed—but I felt a dizzying weakness spread throughout my whole body, like pins and needles, lighting up every neuron, every cell. But I forced myself to lunge—with all my energy, everything that I had.

And, miraculously, I broke away.

I dove for the window and I fell out, the screen popping out and falling underneath me. Then I scrambled up and, without turning back, raced across the grass to my car.

When I got home, I burst inside and locked all the doors. “What’s wrong?” my husband asked, as he came down the stairs. “I just put Jackson to sle—”

He stopped dead on the stairs.

His mouth hung open, as he stared at me. “What?” I asked, as I turned away from the door—but somewhere, deep down, I already knew what he was going to say.

“You look… different,” he said, still frozen on the stairs. “So… [young.”](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
