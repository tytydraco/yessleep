I remember when it was New Year's Eve 1999/2000, computers were supposed to go crazy, and I was waiting with nonalcoholic champagne to see what would happen. 24 years later, after the epidemic, the war in Ukraine and the bombings in Palestine, I am no longer waiting for attractions. I want to take a bottle of vodka, a bottle of champagne and have a good time, I don't take firecrackers, the host lost a finger last year. When I got there, the party was already underway, music was playing, pizza was being served, and costumed couples were flying around with punch in cups. Suddenly, one of the guests, looking at his mobile phone, shouted "people, you won't believe it!"

 

When everyone's eyes turned towards him he stated "UFO has landed!" First the crowd checked if the shouter had not read this information on one of those funny portals, but in fact, the largest portals reported that a space saucer had landed in a field in Dolna, Silesia, Poland. It landed at some unknown time, one of the locals noticed it when he was running there with his dogs; however, the government could have held back this information for a while. The saucer landed and it still stands, it did not carry a cow or even a person, the army surrounded the place with barriers and so the stalemate continues.



Hey, leave the aliens alone, or our party will die – the host said – come on over to the dance floor. And so it went, more rounds of vodka, loud music, dancing… but of course eventually someone had to check the phone and the UFO issue , and quite a few things happened. The US President said that the object would be taken over by them, after all, flying saucers are the most common sight in the States, and the cinematography clearly shows that aliens always want to invade the States, so something went wrong with their navigation, plus as we know, extraterrestrials always speak English, for these reasons they have some experience with them, secondly, the saucer cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of Russia, which is Poland's neighbor, thirdly, Poland is NATO, so it has to politely hand over the spaceship to its ally, because otherwise the ambassador will wag his finger, stomp his foot and it won't be so nice anymore.



The Russian President objected sharply, UFOs in the hands of imperialists would disproportionately increase NATO's military advantage, or maybe the green aliens would prefer to eat caviar, be called Ufov and listen to hardbass?



The First Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party said that it would be better for the old powers not to interfere, they would take and quickly copy all the technology contained there and give it to humanity. Fundamentalist religious groups also expressed interest in the object, for some reason it is not known, there was nothing about flying saucers in their holy books. The increasing pressure on the Polish government caused it to consider recalling the army, so that people would take it to the scrapyard and the problem would disappear.



But enough reading, the party is still going on, the first people have already “fallen on the battlefield”, a couple occupied one of the toilets, someone else was in the other, solo, but for a different purpose. I grab some champagne, the countdown to the new year begins. 10… hey, is there anything new about the UFO ? – I ask someone reading on their phone. The world powers have threatened to use force if the saucer wouldn’t be their soon, but nothing new with the UFO, it just stands there – the other one replied. 5… “so what, host, no firecrackers this year? Heh heh” 3… “there’s already a fireworks show over the city hall, but... too early; why is it so bright…” 2… “oh f….” 1…
