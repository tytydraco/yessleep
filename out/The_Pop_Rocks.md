Last week I was in the Satanic Panic server on Discord and there was this picture of this man fishing but suddenly this other man popped out of the picture. The second man looked like a clown. 

I asked some of the other members of the server if they knew anything about this picture.  It was in channel named  DO NOT LOOK.

A couple people told me it meant The Sleep Creeper was going to start coming for me in my dreams.  After hearing their stories of what happened to them after seeing it, Iâ€™m feeling scared.   Several people have had to take Ambien to try to sleep after the nightmares started. 

Someone else said Iâ€™d be lucky if only thing that happens to me is The Sleep Creeper because several people had accidents after seeing it.  In particular car accidents have happened.  A few other people said really lucky things start to happen for some people.  Itâ€™s the luck of the draw. 

Well, I decided to go straight to the server owner named Mother and she said anyone that goes in there and sees the man will start to have mimics follow them on social media.  

Yesterday I noticed that there are two Reddit accounts copying and pasting everything I say.   They even borrowed my profile  picture I use.  One of them contacted me in DM.  I wanted to dislike them but they were actually super friendly and we talked a lot about how much we love cats.  Both our cats like to wear t-shirts. ðŸ˜‚

Today after my baseball game I splurged and bought 5 packs of pop rocks and an extra large Dr Pepper with extra cherry syrup. I do want to say that I fully chewed them all up. 

When I got home, I noticed my new mimic dm friend had sent me a pic of their cat so I thanked them and we started chatting again.  They asked me if I ate pop rocks today because they were getting psychic premonitions I was going to die in my sleep.   

I asked how they knew that and they said it was part of their satanic ritual that someone needed to die as part of it for them to get their work promotion. They said  I t was them that placed in my head the idea to overeat pop rocks because that is the quickest way to telepathically talk people into dying.

They warned me to not tell anyone else or they might die too because the spell is still in open mode.  I couldnâ€™t even decide if I should tell you all here on no sleep.  

Then they laughed and said they were joking about it all and they just guessed I ate pop rocks based on me saying I just won my baseball tournament. 

I just donâ€™t know now.  My stomach is really starting to hurt.  Itâ€™s making these loud gurgles noises and the gas is getting unbearable.  I just ran down to the kitchen to take some  baking soda and Pepto Bismal now.  I read online that baking soda was the wrong thing to take for pop rocks overdose. 

Iâ€™m trying to watch TV but I just keep hearing this a voice in my head telling me to come to the cradle.  Itâ€™s saying come to the cradle and add roses & berries for the baby.  Why a cradle?  Why a baby?  Iâ€™m really starting to feel Iâ€™m losing my mind.  Iâ€™m hoping some Melatonin helps.  I really donâ€™t know.  If I never return here,  can someone please report my account to Reddit for inspection?
