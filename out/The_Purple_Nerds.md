The first time this happened was a little over a decade and a half ago, I was 8 at the time. It was around Halloween, maybe a couple days after, (clich√© I know, but bear with me).

That night after I fell asleep, I woke up in the middle of the night having to use the bathroom. After making my way across the hall to the bathroom, I lifted the toilet lid up to find a small box of purple Nerds candy floating in the toilet, it's contents sitting on the bottom of the bowl. It was an odd thing to find at that hour, but I chalked it up to being my younger sister's doing with her Halloween candy. Regardless, I was about to get on with my business when, without any warning, I heard a violent tapping at my window, it was so loud and abrupt that it made me jump, almost soiling myself right then and there, whipping my head in the direction of the only window in the bathroom, when I heard it again, loud and consistent, *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap*. I was scared out of my mind, but for some reason I couldn't explain, instead of running to get my parents, something compelled me to open the curtains and see who, or what it was on the other side of the curtains that was so desperate to get my attention. I brushed the curtains aside, and what I saw was horror beyond words, saying it was a monster would be an insult to that which dwells in the deepest parts of hell.

Humanoid in appearance, it was anything but human, dark gray skin if skin is even what it was, almost looking like it was made of smoke, parts of it were coming off and evaporating into nothing, many black holes varying in size covered it's face and body, no hair, ears, or nose, just eyes and a mouth on a human shaped head. It's eyes were perhaps the most unsettling though, because they looked very human, except they glowed a fluorescent white. It was impossible to decide where it's other features began and ended unless it was in my peripheral vision, like my brain couldn't even process what was there even if it wanted to, and I was forced to fill in the blanks.

I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, and lets just say I didn't have to use the bathroom anymore. What followed was it opening it's toothless mouth, it's flat mouth and jawline making it almost looking like that of some kind of twisted puppet when it did, showing nothing inside but an empty black void. The sound that came out after, I'll never forget that sound as long as I live, it was like a screaming whisper, with a kind of echoing ring to it, like cosmic wind chimes. Whatever the sound was, it was pulling me in, the thing's eyes glaring into me like a car's high beams as I was slowly getting drawn closer to it's open void of a mouth, no matter how hard I struggled or tried to scream, it was pointless. Slowly, it pulled me in, closer and closer, until I woke up.

I wish I could say that this was the end, that this was just some crazy nightmare fabricated by the creative imagination of an adolescent mind. I didn't know it at the time, as I laid there, cold and damp in my soiled pajamas in a deep fear induced sleep paralysis, but this wouldn't be my last visit from that monster. It wasn't until my mother came in to wake me did I find the strength to move. I briefly told her about my nightmare and she comforted me like any parent would as she changed my bedsheets and brought out a fresh change of clothes for me to change into after I showered. 

When I made my way to the bathroom to shower, my attention was immediatly drawn to the window, where it was now welcoming in a bright ray of morning sunshine. I couldn't help but rethink how the nightmare was so vivid, everything was the same, the pale yellow wallpaper, the floral patterns on the white curtains, even though it was daytime, I was staying as far away from that window as I could. The shower felt nice, almost nice enough to make me forget that nightmare entirely, it wasn't until shortly after I got out and got changed that my stomach dropped like an anvil. There, clear as day, floating in the toilet, was a box of purple Nerds.
