No, you’re not hallucinating the title. Don’t judge me, it’s difficult to be spooky and mysterious all the time. In fact, you’ll probably find that it was the best way to summarize the morning’s events.

Remember when I talked about a late breakfast? Well, by the time I woke from my ‘brief nap’, the sun was already shining way overhead. It was noon. Even worse, I was still bleary-eyed while I freshened up and descended the stairs into the inner atrium. Getting half-frozen to death does tend to do a number on one’s sleep schedule.

Durham was lounging on the couch with a cup of tea, suitcases packed and ready to go beside him. He gave me a thin smile when he saw me, getting to his feet. “Mr. Sen! Sleeping in for the day?”

I motioned for him to sit down, stifling a yawn. “No, no. Just… stayed up late. Discovering the place, you know?”

“Of course. One must familiarize oneself with one’s lot.” He took a sip out of his cup, nodding towards my hand. “Are you sure we do not need to get the ring altered? Your grandfather, God rest his soul, had quite meaty fingers.”

I shook my head. “I don’t think that will be necessary. It fits just fine.”

“I see.”

Some of you had raised doubts as to what would happen to the estate in case there were no firstborn males left to inherit at all, so I raised the question with him.

He rubbed his chin, narrowing his eyes at me. “This question? Already?”

“I don’t understand what you mean.”

“No, no, I mean, it has only been a day. It usually takes longer before the *Thakurs* start planning for their deaths.”

I steepled my fingers, leaning forward. “Well, these are unusual times.”

“Yes, I suppose.” He sighed. “In such a situation, there is no prescribed line of succession.”

“None?”

“Well, nothing explicit. Say, if you were to die at this moment, God forbid, without a son, grandson, or any other descendant in your line, we would have no idea who to invite to take over. However, in such a case, the estate has prescribed contingencies.”

“Contingencies?”

“Two sealed documents, kept with us since we started working with your family. They are to be opened only in cases where the firstborn line has been extinguished. They apparently prescribe what is to be done in such a situation.”

“Have you ever seen their contents? Have they been opened?”

“The contingency plan dictates that, in such an event, we are to hand the first document over to the eldest surviving male of the family, who will carry out the instructions contained therein. So, no, I have not seen the document. None of my family have. It is only if every male member traceable is dead or otherwise indisposed that we are permitted to open the second document and put into effect the other, secondary contingency plan within.” He placed the cup down on the table and leaned back, contemplating. “As far as I can recall, only the first contingency has ever been opened, and only once.”

“When?”

“In the time of your grandfather’s grandfather, Durga Charan Thakur. Durga Charan had once disappeared into the forest behind the village, a few weeks after he had been married. Obviously, he had produced no children with his wife yet. A full year passed without any sighting of him, and he was presumed dead. Then, we handed over the first letter to Harihar, his younger brother, who unsealed and read it. However, only two days after that, Durga Charan returned from the forest, battered and gravely injured, but alive. Thus, the plan was never put into effect. The letter was resealed and returned to our custody, where it has remained ever since.”

“Did Harihar…”

“No. He never spoke of the letter’s contents to anyone. Not that I know of, anyway.”

“I see.” I nodded to his luggage, quickly changing the subject before he could press me in return. “All packed up?”

“Yes, your servant has gone to fetch my car. Once he’s found the bloody thing, I’ll be off.” He gave me another smile, though it was less professional and more friendly this time. “Word of advice, Mr. Sen, don’t worry too much about these things. One’s death is a morbid concern. Think about it too much, and you might just attract it.”

“I’m not sure it works that way, Mr. Durham.”

“Maybe so, but in my experience, the paranoid ones die first. Heart attack gets them, if nothing else. Speaking of which…” He nodded towards the outer atrium. “Your uncle has been pacing and muttering out there all morning. I think he’s waiting for you. Better go talk to him.”

“Right.”

He had said we were going to talk in the morning. Snoring through that may not have been the best call. I had already landed myself in deep shit by ignoring my grandfather, after all.

But my mind was still chewing on Durham’s words as I passed through the hallway leading outside the family wing and to the outer, common wing.

Contingency plans. That was frustratingly less enlightening than I had been hoping, but the key pieces were in order: the plan had to be executed by the eldest surviving male of the family. At the moment, that would be my eldest uncle. The circumstances seemed to indicate that contingency was to pass on the estate to the lineage of the next surviving male heir in such an event. It made no sense to pass the property down in any other way.

Given how confusing everything already had been around here, applying logic was a dangerous game. But, reasonably speaking, what else could the contingency even be?

In such a situation, if I die, the contingency would be executed by my uncle, and the estate would probably pass to him. Hell, if I hadn’t been born when I was, my father’s death would have made him the heir. Even in the story Durham had told, Harihar, Durga Charan’s brother, had been the one to receive and execute the plan.

My uncle had lived on the estate all his life. He had worked alongside my grandfather and then my father ever since he could. He knew this land inside and out. Everything the Ferryman had told me about our family, he probably knew. Hell, he probably knew more. Now, he had to see this land, this grave responsibility, passed on to some clueless nincompoop who had managed to run headlong into his death two times in a single day here.

Who wouldn’t be angry?

Who wouldn’t want to fix it?

On the other hand, he had been nothing but supportive ever since I arrived here. Sure, he failed to warn me about the Spirals, but in all fairness, how could he? I came here without calling ahead. I’m sure he knew I was eventually coming, but surely not within a day. Besides, I had ignored all of their attempts at reaching out so far. What’s another missed call or unread letter?

If he wanted to take over the place, he could have done any number of things to me already. Hell, before the events of last night, he could have just asked. I would have handed it over, packed my bags, and hightailed it back to Kolkata.

Why didn’t he?

The truth of the matter is that I don’t know. But I have to find out. In the meantime, I have little choice but to follow his lead.

All these thoughts were swiftly pushed to the back of my mind as I entered the outer atrium. I did notice my uncle on the couch beside my grandmother, perking up as he saw me enter. However, the first thing that caught my eye was outside, in the courtyard.

A burly man in a faded *lungi* was waiting on the steps of the main entrance, a scarf tied haphazardly around his head. He was bare from the waist up, putting his hairy chest and massive potbelly on full display. His well-muscled arms tightly gripped a rope, the other end of which was tied around an incredibly belligerent goat.

I understand how mundane that sounds, but this goat was anything but ordinary. I had seen some prime specimens in the meat shops of Kolkata, but this one blew them all out of the water. It was burly and large, standing at about half the height of its handler on all fours. Two massive, black horns curled out of its head in perfect spirals, symmetrical in every way. Its fur was shiny, without a single blemish or speck of dirt. The air of filth and odour that ordinarily surrounded village cattle was completely absent. Hell, even its eyes were large and intelligent, almost human-like as they stared right into mine.

Despite the man’s strong build, the goat’s struggles dragged him around easily, forcing him to dig his feet in and use both hands to restrain it. As soon as he saw me, he managed to fold his hands and bow briefly, before the animal yanked him to the side yet again.

My grandmother rose to her feet and rushed to me. “There he is! Are you okay, sweetheart? When Bhanu went to wake you, you were as still as a corpse!”

“I told you he would be fine, *maa*.” My uncle came up behind her, flashing me another one of his grins. “He had a rough day, that’s all.”

I gave my grandmother a reassuring kiss on the cheek. “Sorry about this. I know we were supposed to talk, but I just couldn’t open my eyes.”

“No problem, kiddo. We can start anytime. You’re the boss now.”

Right. I gave him a small smile in return.

He walked up and lightly touched Grandma’s shoulders. “*Maa*, you should go rest now. We need to discuss some business.”

“*Thakur*!”

The man on the steps was calling me, his eyes squinting with effort.

“What do I do with the goat, *Thakur*?”

“Ah, right.” My uncle led me over to the steps. “This is Jogen. He is the village’s best butcher. He lives here, on the estate.”

I nodded. “Hello, Jogen. What’s the goat for?”

“It is a gift, *Thakur*,” he rumbled from beneath his moustache. “To celebrate your arrival.”

“Oh! Um…” I scratched my head. “Thanks, I guess? Though I don’t think I’m anything worth celebrating.”

Jogen scrunched his eyebrows together, studying me with a curious look.

“Jogen!” my uncle interrupted. “What am I going to do with a live goat? Of that fearsome size, too! It’s much bigger than your usual ones.”

“That would be my fault.”

I recognized this voice well. It belonged to an unkempt man with long, unruly hair running down to his shoulders and a prickly stubble. He sauntered into view from the side of the entranceway, wearing a faded leather jacket with one of the family hunting rifles propped on a shoulder.

I ran up and hugged him. He smelled of mud, crushed leaves, and musk. Just as I remembered.

“Uncle!”

His pale, yellow eyes shone as he looked me up and down, a faint smile on his face. “Looking good, kiddo. Working out?”

“Sometimes.”

“You’re back!” my elder uncle said. “Good. I was beginning to get worried. We can’t afford another loss.”

“Yeah, I guess so.” He subtly rolled his eyes at me before leaning the rifle against the doorway and stepping into the seating area. “Saw this little guy stalking around the forest while I was out and decided to catch it.” He ruffled my hair. “I know how much you like mutton, so I thought I’d bring home a surprise.”

My grandmother hurried over and gave the goat a once-over. “Yes, yes, this will do nicely. Jogen, take it to the back courtyard. I’m too old to slaughter goats myself now.”

Jogen nodded and, with one massive pull, hoisted the goat onto his shoulders. It kicked and struggled impotently in his grip. “As you wish, *Maa Thakrun*.”

“Go, go, hurry up!” My grandmother was almost jumping with joy now. “I will cook mutton curry tonight for my little boy!”

I couldn’t help but crack a smile at her childlike enthusiasm, but that smile was soon wiped away by a crushing sense of guilt. She had so much love left to give me. All of them did.

And I had thrown it all away. For what?

I should have come sooner.

“If you both would like to take a seat,” my elder uncle prompted, “unless you would like to freshen up first, brother.”

“You know what? I would. I wouldn’t want to get all this dust on the cushions. Besides, your lectures are boring.” He gave me another wink before grabbing his rifle and lazily wandering away.

“Right.” My uncle shook his head again. “Also, *maa*, save the mutton for tomorrow, will you? I don’t think he will be dining with us today.”

I frowned, sinking into the couch. “What do you mean?”

“Remember what I said yesterday? About rituals? Well, you have to perform one tonight. Every new *Thakur* must do this. I’ll explain the details when we get to them, but you’ll probably be spending the night outside the house.”

“What kind of ritual?”

“Well, it’s a way of letting yourself get familiar with the land. More importantly, letting the land get familiar with you. It would be easier if you were already living here, only a couple of hours long. But you are a stranger. Everything about you is foreign. Unfamiliar. Threatening, potentially.” He grimaced slightly. “We will have to be much more thorough. The rituals must be performed in the old ways. The ways our ancestors followed when they first came to the land. When they were all as much outsiders as you are.”

“I… see.”

So, I was supposed to spend the night outside the manor’s defences (which, given last night, I did not trust very much in the first place) in a place that was verifiably and lethally haunted, while doing some esoteric ritual I had absolutely zero practice with. All at my uncle’s insistence.

He isn’t beating the allegations anytime soon, it seems.

My grandmother looked a little concerned, but did not contradict him. Instead, she nodded lightly and slowly walked away. I guess he wasn’t completely lying then, at least.

“Anyway…” He shrugged. “I’m sure you’ll do fine. You’ve got the family blood in your veins. Speaking of which, I think it’s time we talked.”

I crossed my arms. “I agree.”

“I’m not sure how much you understand about what it is we are here for, but I’m sure you have some ideas.”

“I’ve got the gist. Ancient land. Lots of monsters. We kill what we can, contain what we can’t, reason with whatever can be reasoned with. Prevent them from killing us. Mostly.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been talking to people.”

“I don’t know about people. But talking, yes.” I sighed. “There’s a tall man. His head is completely smooth. He wears a broad hat and a long cloak. Do you know anything about him?”

“Ah. That.” His jaw clenched slightly, as if he had just stepped in dog poo. “That one, I’m afraid I can’t help you with. None of us have ever seen it. It only appears to the *Thakur* of the village. Well, that’s not true. It appears to a lot of people. The *Thakur* is the only one it doesn’t kill afterwards.”

“Why?”

He shrugged. “It is mentioned in the oldest family records, mostly as a neutral observer of events, sometimes as a helper. It feeds on people too, though rarely. But over the centuries, it has appeared less and less to the family, though we kept finding traces of its hunts in the village. It was only with your grandfather that he began appearing regularly once more, and the attacks completely stopped. Since then, there have been no more incidents, so we’ve mostly ignored its existence. Even after your grandfather’s death, it hasn’t made any moves. Though I suppose I know it now has. On you.”

“Right.” Calling the Man in the Cloak’s actions ‘moves’ was an understatement, but he didn’t need to know that. “He hasn’t really… harmed me, in case you were wondering. He just talks a lot.”

“About what?”

“Cryptic stuff, mostly.”

“I see.” He leaned back. “Unsurprising. Most of these things only imitate intelligence. They don’t possess it, not really. Deep down, they’re run by very simple considerations.”

I’m not sure that was the case here, but I didn’t correct him. “I managed to piece together the situation from his ramblings, more or less. Him and the Ferryman.”

My uncle frowned. “The… Ferryman?”

“You know.” I vaguely gestured at the village. “The bus driver?”

“There’s something off with the bus driver?”

“You didn’t notice the—” I started incredulously, before forcing myself to start again. “We are talking about the same driver, right?”

I rattled off a quick description.

He nodded. “Sounds like him, but he looked entirely normal every time I’ve seen him. Definitely no stars in his eyes.”

“Right. So, it’s the same guy, just… spooky now? Is he, like, possessed?”

“Could be. Alternatively, something could have killed him and assumed his form. He always seemed like he knew how to take care of himself, though. Maybe he always was from the other side, and something awakened him from dormancy? Hell, maybe it’s just a coincidental lookalike.” He shrugged. “Honestly, I shouldn’t even be surprised. Things have been going topsy-turvy around here nowadays. More than usual.”

“Strange things. Strange people. That’s what everybody keeps saying. Like the Spirals.”

“The ash-whirlpool faces? Yes, those are new.” My uncle sighed. “The villagers are used to these things by now. They have lived here for centuries alongside them. Even on the rare occasion that something new crawls out of the bogs of the underside, we adapt quickly, and life goes on. But these things, and others like them, are different. They’ve been showing up recently, and they’ve sent everyone into a tizzy, on this side and the other.”

“Why?”

“They weren’t born here. They’re migrating in.”

“And that’s a problem?”

He laughed lightly. “This place is a prison, kid. Our boundaries, our power, keep our residents inside and away from others. Very few exceptions. Once they come here, they can’t leave. It’s like walking willingly into a cage. For all their otherness, they have their own rules, drives, and interests. They would never confine themselves by choice. Unless…”

“Unless something bigger is calling out to them, overriding that instinct,” I finished.

He nodded. “You learn quickly. I… We… fear they’re being invited in. Starting about a month before your grandfather died, strange men from outside kept coming here all the time. They would have some strangeness around them, always: black cloaks, strange tattoos, or matching hairstyles. Something was always the matter. They would snoop around, trespassing, interrogating people, and taking cuttings from plants here and there. The villagers began to feel afraid, and they complained to our father. Then, he had them kicked out. But after he died, they’ve slowly started coming back. Not as openly, but they’re here. And from the looks of it, they’re bringing friends.”

“We need to do something about that, then.”

“Yes, we do. The police are on the lookout, but the station here is incredibly understaffed. Patrols are easy to dodge. I’ve been thinking about sending *lathials* out to supplement them, but that would leave the estate more vulnerable. Now that you’re here, I’ll leave the choices to you.”

This man was sending more mixed signals than a yellow light at a traffic stop.

“But before that, we need to talk about a few ground rules,” he warned.

“Rules?”

“Nothing too difficult. Just some guidelines, to help you get accustomed to the place. Stop you from dying or horribly maiming yourself, or worse.”

From behind the house, a steady noise rose up. The thunk of a blade against wood. It carried on like a metronome, at perfectly equal intervals. A practised hand.

Guess that was it for the goat.

My uncle leaned forward now, snapping his fingers to call my attention. “I need you to listen to this part carefully. I know I said the place is safe, but it’s only so if you keep your wits about you. There are things on this land that all the boundaries and protections in the world cannot stop, because of their power or maybe their very nature. Luckily, most of them have particular laws by which they are governed. Stick to those laws, and they’ll leave you alone.”

Now, look, I’m good at remembering long lists of conditions. I’m a lawyer. It’s what we do. But that doesn’t mean I like to do it, especially in the form of a longwinded lecture. This sounded like it was going to devolve into another rules checklist I would have to tape to my wall (eventually, assuming the stereotype held, I would forget one crucial detail and bring about my own downfall). That was simply not how I remembered things.

Thankfully, I was saved from this ordeal by Bhanu’s voice carrying in from the main gate.

“*Babu*! *Babu*! The car is here!”

My uncle frowned. “Anyway, as I was saying…”

“Bhanu! Bhanu!” I called, interrupting him.

“Something wrong?”

“Uncle, this sounds really important, but can we pick it up later?”

He frowned. “Kid, this is literally life and death. I’m not joking around. You know that. You need to know how to deal with these things, or you won’t make it.”

“I know, I know. But—”

“Oh, let him be.” My second uncle came in through the hall, towelling his still-wet hair lazily. “Like he’s going to remember all that anyway. There are dozens of those things out there!”

“If he can’t remember that much—”

“He will. Just not through a lecture.” He plopped down on the couch beside his elder brother. “We learned on the job. He will, too. He got through Day One.”

“Barely,” I reminded him.

“Well, still counts. Besides, he shouldn’t have to do everything himself, all at once. That’s why we’re here.”

“The way things are going, who knows how long we will be?”

“Come on, don’t say that.”

Bhanu came rushing through the door, holding his *gamcha* around his neck. “*Babu*?”

“Bhanu,” I faced him, “I need to see your father. Do you know where he lives?”

He hesitated for a moment, before nodding. “Yes.”

“Ram Lal?” both of my uncles asked simultaneously, before looking at each other with frowns.

“Why him?” the elder one managed.

I shrugged. “He’s been with Grandpa the longest. If anyone knows something about what he was doing before he… before it happened, it’s going to be him.”

“Hm…” His yellow eyes bored into me, though his expression remained relaxed. “Good thinking. See? He’s smart.”

I turned back to Bhanu. “Can you take me to your father, Bhanu?”

“Now?” he asked, wide-eyed.

“Yes.” I raised an eyebrow. “Is there a problem?”

He hesitated for a moment, before vigorously shaking his head. “No, *Babu*. I will take you. Do you want to go by car? I will ask them to bring it to the gate if so, but it’s not very far from here.”

“We could walk.”

“No.” My elder uncle looked at me. “The less time you spend out there right now, the better. It will become safer after the ritual. After you’re tested.”

“But a car?”

“Bhanu, take him by your bicycle.”

Bhanu’s eyes became as wide as saucers. “The *Thakur*? On a bicycle? With me?”

“Yes. And take care of him out there. If he needs any help. Anything at all.”

Before I could fully contemplate those sinister undertones, I had managed to bundle Bhanu out of the house and onto his trusty cycle. Riding pillion on a two-wheeler was still bringing back bad memories from yesterday, but at least this time the ride was a lot bumpier. That helped to keep my mind off the paranoia gnawing at it. Thankfully, no Spirals appeared this time. The defences appeared to be doing their job.

Bhanu’s lodgings were only a few minutes away from the manor. It was a small, two-room wooden cabin with a fireplace, though it did not look like it was in use anymore. A small porch light was still on over the door, despite it being the middle of the day. It had not been turned off in the morning.

Strange. Bhanu and I looked at each other before swinging ourselves off the cycle and approaching the door. He knocked on the door.

“*Babuji*! Open the door! *Babuji*!”

There was no response inside. A small window beside the door offered the only way to look inside, so I did. It was evidently meant to be a living room, though there was little by the way of furniture. A small television set was tucked up against the corner with a foldable stool. There was also a small metal cabinet against the wall. A number of cushions were strewn across the floor as makeshift seats. Clothes and rags hung from hooks on the wall beside a mirror. In the other corner, cheap metal plates and utensils had been arranged into a rack alongside a small sink. A doorway in the back, covered by curtains, led into the bedroom.

Both rooms were dark and silent.

“*Babuji*!” Bhanu knocked again.

In the split second it took for me to look away and see this, a face appeared at the window, pressing right up against mine through the glass. I staggered back, grabbing the porch railing for support. It was an old man, balding, with some patches of grey hair left around the sides of his head. His eyes were wide and bloodshot as they shifted, unblinking, between Bhanu and me.

“*Babuji*!” Bhanu moved over and tapped on the window. “Let us in! Open the door!”

So, this was Ram Lal. He was much, much older than I remembered. In fact, I thought he looked older than he was supposed to be.

Ram Lal shook his head vigorously and banged his finger against the glass, pointing to something behind us.

When we turned, it looked like a man. Almost.

He was entirely naked from head to toe, grimy beard and hair covering his face completely. Only his nose remained visible, covered in pustules oozing pus. Dirt, mud, and dried fluids caked his body from head to toe, and his belly was bloated and distended with starvation. Flies flitted about his head, making a constant droning noise that sounded less in my ears and more in my skull. His hands were long and bony, almost hanging down to his knees. The nails on his hands and feet, blackened and crusty with grime, were so long they had begun to curl back on themselves. Here and there, open gangrenes and sores gaped through the muck, blood-red and raw. He walked slowly, haltingly, up the steps of the porch, mouth opening to reveal yellowed, cracked teeth as he moaned pitifully.

Moments later, the stench hit me. It was an overpowering smell of rot and decay, so strong that my head spun and my sinuses burned. I could feel my legs threatening to give way under me, even as a strangled scream escaped my lips.

Bhanu cursed and vaulted over the railing, running over to a small field near the house. He had abandoned me to my fate.

I tried to run, but the man got even closer, and the stench was like a bomb going off inside my nose, forcing me to my knees and making my eyes water. I gagged, coughed, and sneezed, trying to get it out of me, but it only got stronger and stronger, burning every inch of me from the inside out. All the while, the man kept getting closer.

The necklace burned against my collarbone, its now-familiar stabs of danger crashing against my temples. Even though my thoughts were rapidly fogging over, I let it guide me. It was pointing towards the ring on my left hand.

But what was I supposed to do with it?

My body began to shut down. The man was almost upon me now, shambling with that same, perfectly even, awfully deliberate gait.

“*Babu*!”

Bhanu’s voice was watery and indistinct in my ears.

“*Babu*!”

With some difficulty, I managed to turn my neck and look behind me.

Bhanu had clambered onto the porch railing, reaching out with something in his hand. My eyes blurred and watered as I tried to focus on it.

“Take it, *babu*, take it!”

I was no longer inside my body, completely detached. Everything felt like it was happening to someone else. Not me. Not me. Not me.

I felt myself gagging and coughing as I tried to focus and get to my feet. Something slick and wet touched my fingers as I held on to the floor for support. It was vomit. The world was beginning to take on a brownish tint, indistinct and rippling like a bog. The necklace continued burning, sticking daggers into my head.

The only thing that retained its normal appearance was the ring. Hell, it was glowing. A diffuse golden light, like a candle at the edge of my vision. I had to do something.

So, marshalling every bit of strength I had left, I raised my hand. Then I punched myself in the chest.

The pain was unnaturally sharp, flaring like a bonfire, burying its stingers deep in my flesh. I cried out, almost involuntarily. But then my vision sharpened, clearing with such speed that it was difficult to believe that there had ever been something wrong with it. The stench stopped assaulting my nostrils. Noxious brown gas poured out of my open mouth as I coughed, almost flowing like a liquid as it spread over the floor and vaporized into thin air. Small spatters of blood came with it.

But I could see now. I could move now. I whipped my head around again. Bhanu was holding a spike of wheat out for me, probably from one of the nearby fields. He had a similar one in his other hand. Too late, I noticed something above Ram Lal’s door: another spike, tied to the doorframe with twine. My uncle’s words echoed in my mind.

*“There are things on this land that all the boundaries and protections in the world cannot stop. Luckily, most of them have particular laws by which they are governed. Stick to those laws, and they’ll leave you alone.”*

Not listening was going to be the death of me one day. But for now, I had to move.

I lunged, using my feet as springboards to propel myself towards his outstretched gift.

Then I stopped dead.

A diseased, grimy hand was wrapped around my waist, unnaturally powerful despite its frail appearance.

The man had caught up to me. I felt his body against my back, the filth squelching and sliding with every movement. A few of the flies landed on my face, exploring its nooks and crannies.

“Hungry.”

The voice was a raspy whisper in my ears.

“*Babu*!” Bhanu screamed. He leaned over the railing, trying to close the distance between us, but he was still a few paces away.

He seemed unwilling to get any closer. Rule or no rule, interrupting the man’s hunt meant certain death.

“Food.”

He leaned in closer, his nose rubbing against my earlobe as he sniffed at me.

“Give. Food.”

Bhanu jerked the spike of wheat urgently.

That was what he wanted.

And if he didn’t get it…

“No… Food?” The low whisper sounded more sad than angry.

I felt something hot and liquid land on my shoulder. Though my brain was screaming at me to stay still, I tilted my head to look.

The man was crying, black sludge leaking from his scrunched, cataract-white eyes.

“No… food.” He stopped crying, though his face remained contorted. “But I… must… eat.”

Then he opened his mouth, jaw stretching, snapping, and dislocating as it stretched impossibly wide. He bit down on my shoulder.

The pain was immediate and blinding. A ragged scream tore through my throat as his teeth easily punched through the flesh, sinking deep. I struggled wildly, trying to shake him off, but his grip was like iron. His hand didn’t even budge around my waist; instead, he wrapped his other arm around me as well, holding me still as he continued to nibble, gnaw, and chomp.

There was only pain now. Searing, all-consuming, tracing trails of fire up and down my arm, neck, and chest. Breaths came in strangled gasps. I screamed again, thrashing wildly in his grasp. His teeth bit deeper and deeper. The area around the wound began to throb with infection. Then it blackened and rotted, the blight spreading slowly but surely.

Bhanu cursed and vaulted over the railing, dropping the wheat as he looked for a weapon.

But he would be too late. I could already feel my neck tingling. Decaying. My brain would soon do the same. At least it would not take long before I could no longer feel it. The pain was without any definition now, a featureless void that blocked out all other sensations. I did not know anything except it. Dimly, the teeth bit deeper and deeper. Soon, he would take a chunk.

A crack of wood slamming against something hard broke through the din. The chewing ceased, grinding teeth temporarily halted by… something. The man released my shoulder from his mouth, allowing me to turn my head and look.

Ram Lal was standing behind us, the wooden foldable stool in hand. A mix of mud and fresh blood caked the end.

“Get away from him, you *pisach*!” he shouted, whacking him on the head again. Blood burst from the injury and flowed like tar.

The man let me go and turned to face him, his calm expression contorting into murderous rage. I collapsed to the ground, crying and screaming freely now as I clutched at the mangled remains of my shoulder. The infection was still spreading through me, albeit a bit slower.

“*Baba*!” Bhanu screamed, torn between helping me and his father.

Ram Lal swung again, but this time, the man effortlessly caught it. The wood rotted and fell apart under his hands as he yanked the stool from his hands and tossed it away.

“Let. Me. Eat!” he roared, charging forward at an unexpected speed, his hands inches away from wrapping around the old man’s throat.

“Hey!” A female voice called from behind me. “Over here!”

Through a film of tears, I saw that someone was standing over me, dangling the wheat Bhanu had dropped from her fingers.

“Look.” The voice was low and rich. “Food.”

The man’s face slackened, losing all sense of purpose as instincts took over. He turned, reaching out a hand towards the woman. “Food?”

“Yes, food.” She tossed it away from us, off the porch and onto the road. “Go get it.”

He shambled off after it, clapping his hands like a child. “Food! Food! Food!”

I gasped as another wave of pain ripped through me. I doubled over, curling into a fetal position. The infection was at my cheek now, still spreading upwards.

“Ssh…” Cold hands wrapped around my shoulders, lifting me into a seated position. “We can’t keep meeting like this, darling. People are going to talk.”

Frigid lips pressed against my cheek in a light kiss. I felt the familiar crackle of frost spreading over my skin. The relief was immediate, the pain dulled and cooled. She continued, trailing light pecks down my neck, shoulder, and arm. Everywhere she touched, the frost sprouted like a seedling, threading and intertwining into a cover over the affected area.

“There, all better. Stop crying now. The wound itself will take some time, but it will heal.”

I managed to force my eyes open, panting and sniffling as I looked at the lady in white. She gave me a small smile in return.

Ram Lal had collapsed against the door frame, panting hard with fear and exertion as the adrenalin left him. Bhanu had gone to check on him, though he kept glancing in my direction.

The cannibal-apparent, meanwhile, was crouching on the ground, eating the wheat with both hands like a dog.

“There are only two things he can eat,” the lady whispered in my ear, “wheat or human flesh. Carry one, or he will feed on the other. That is the rule.”

I managed to look at her. “You’re… here? Now?”

She cocked an eyebrow. “Why not?”

I supposed I associate things like frost and cold with the night. Her appearance, her nature, did not feel proper somehow in the day, while the heat of the sun still shone upon us. It was like watching a badly photoshopped picture. The wrongness was deep, impossible to place a finger on and yet apparent.

“Because… you shouldn’t be here,” I managed, knowing it was true somehow.

She studied me for a moment, before nodding. “No. I shouldn’t.”

“You came… to help me?”

“Of course.” She smirked. “Like I said, *Thakur*, we’re friends.” Then she grew serious. “But this can’t keep happening. You understand that, don’t you?”

I didn’t know how, but I did. Her relationship with me gave her a bit of leeway, but it was as the Man in the Cloak had said. Help was an expression of allegiance. Choosing sides. At the moment, my side was not worth choosing.

I nodded. “I know.”

“Good. You’re learning. Nice trick with the ring.” She gave me another smirk. “Though the punching was not necessary. A tap would have been fine.”

Lesson learned. My ribs still hurt from that one.

“Thank you.” I had no idea what she was, or what she wanted, but I meant it.

“Next time, you’re on your own. Got it?”

“Yes.”

“Good boy.” She gave me another peck on the cheek. Somehow, it wasn’t as cold as before. “Now, I need to go. I’m weaker than usual now, under the sun. There are many who would like me dead. I need to get away before they find out I’m here. You can handle yourself, right?”

I nodded, struggling onto my feet. She rose with me, helping me slightly with the weight.

“I wasn’t sticking around anyway.” She gave me an exaggerated parade wave before walking off the porch and into the sun. Her form melted like a block of ice, rapidly turning into a puddle of water. She seeped into the ground and vanished.

“*Thakur*!” Bhanu called, running up to me. “Are you alright?”

I touched the injured shoulder. A thick layer of ice covered it, refusing to melt even in the sweltering heat. Underneath, I could feel the flesh itching as it mended. “I… think so?”

“The lady… She still recognizes you.”

I looked at Ram Lal, who was now standing on his feet, albeit a little unsteadily.

“You… remember?”

“I remember, young lord. You two were inseparable when you were a boy.” He walked up and folded his hands, bowing deeply. “Welcome to Chhayagarh, *Thakur*. I wish we could have reunited in better spirits.”

I grabbed his shoulders, making him stand straight. “I’m like your son, Ram Lal. You shouldn’t bow to me. I won’t accept it.”

He gave me a small, tired smile. “As you wish.”

“Do you mind if we come inside? I have a few questions to ask. About my grandfather.”

Ram Lal nodded. “Of course.”

He ushered us inside, apologizing profusely for the lack of furniture. There was only one chair in the entire house, now that the stool was gone. Bhanu fetched it from the bedroom for me, and then sat down on one of the cushions nearby. Ram Lal offered to talk over some food, as it was almost lunchtime. I accepted.

I can already move my injured arm, though not by much. Typing like this is difficult. It took a… process, to say the least, but now I’m finally here. I’m going to get answers. Whether they will only lead to more questions, I cannot say.

But there is only one way to find out.
