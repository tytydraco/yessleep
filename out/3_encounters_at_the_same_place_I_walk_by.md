2nd one was last week, so I go to work at 5am and I get up around 3am to get ready to walk my dogs. I've been doing this a few months after moving to this place, and had the 1st encounter about a month ago, but it didn't leave a huge impression so I kinda shrugged that one off.

I head out of my apartment with my 2 dogs to go for a 30+ min walk around 345am. The side walk goes around the whole complex, and has many crossways. There's residents on one side, other apartments on the other, the main road, and a creek on the others. I take the path towards the creek, and at the corner of the apartments close to the creak path, the path is right next to a residence that has a treehouse next to the fence. As I walk by there I hear little kids laughing and playing, and I heard this the 1st time I passed weeks ago, but this time I stopped because my leashes make noise and so does walking my pets. I pull them back and we're standing still. I then hear the voice of a child say, "huh?!" loudly. I got chills, and kept walking completely freaking out because the treehouse was dark, and empty, and there is nobody else outside at 3 in the morning. It was also freezing cold that morning. I finished our walk, and told my wife what happened. But she didn't believe me. I drove to work scared, and teary-eyed.

3rd time, I went to walk them with my son around 9pm. I don't pass by there in the mornings anymore. We are passing by, and I'm telling him this is the tree house that I heard those voices. So we stop, and he's a teen and starts to call them out. Like show yourself, and say something, he also started saying curse words, which I hate that they do, but the last thing he said was, "Pussies." At this time I'm already starting to walk away but after he'd said that something touched the back of my head. I have my baseball cap on backwards, and it felt like someone slid there finger up underneath the bill. I turned around, and he was standing like 3 steps away and asked him if he touched my head. He said no, but I knew that already because he was so far back from me. So we freaked out and kept walking. I had chills the whole walk, and kept saying it was probably a bug, or something. It still gives me chills and I have goosebumps on my arms as I write this. I told my wife, and we're all just in disbelief.

I've had experiences in my life, but this one actually touched me, and that was something new. Thank you for reading, I felt like writing this encounter. It's ok if you don't believe me, I just wanted to get it off my chest.
