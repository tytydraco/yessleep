All Thai universities have at least one haunted area. My friend Naru showed me a thread on ‘Pantip’, a Thai version of Reddit, which cataloged all classic Thai university ghost stories.

&#x200B;

At a university where we were going to have a swim meet, a girl was killed inside her dorm.  She became this charred undead being that could crawl on walls and ceilings and would terrorize the female dorm’s 6th floor, at least according to this Pantip thread.

&#x200B;

Despite knowing this, my teammates and I were excited to compete in this Olympic size swimming pool and weren’t too concerned.

&#x200B;

Once we arrived at the infamous female dorm, I jokingly asked the lady at the front desk about the 6th floor. She told us to not kid around because we were all going to be staying on the 6th floor. I turned to Naru and we both laughed nervously and held each other’s hands.

&#x200B;

We went up to our room on the 6th floor with no problem. The hallway was shiny and clean, and our room was great. Coming from a remote province in Thailand, we never experienced anything like this. Mini-fridge. Widescreen TV opposite the bed. Yeah, we were country bumpkins.

&#x200B;

Our coach told us that they will shut off the electricity for maintenance in about an hour and the elevator will not be working. It was important to not forget anything on our way down the stairs because we would have to walk back up to get it.

&#x200B;

Naru and I left the practice earlier than our teammates and we were back at the dorm at 6.00 pm. Nobody was at the front desk and the lights seemed to be backed on, so we used the elevator to go up. Honestly, I was so tired, I totally forgot about the haunting and just want to collapse on the soft bed.

&#x200B;

And then, the elevator got stuck. Lights went off and so was the fan. We laughed at first. I looked at my smartphone and there was no signal. It took about less than a minute for the air to become thick and we started to get nervous.

&#x200B;

I used my phone’s flashlight to find the intercom. I pressed it and yelled that we were stuck inside. A voice of an elderly woman asked what floor we were on. This was strange because the two women at the front desk we saw were not that old. This sounded like a grandmother.

&#x200B;

When we said we could not remember, she started to laugh, which made me feel uneasy. I didn’t give her my usual sass though, because our lives were in her hands. The old lady then said that we should pry open the elevator door and that if we weren’t in between floors, we should just exit.

&#x200B;

We told her that that is dangerous. There’s a sign that said that that was literally the one thing we should not do. It was one of the few ways a person can die from an elevator.

&#x200B;

The old lady sighed very loudly, like she wanted us to hear it, and said that the lights won’t come back on anytime soon. If we are not brave, then we might have to sleep in there.

&#x200B;

Mustering all my courage, I pried open the elevator door, which was easier than I thought. We were somewhat in between the floor, but the top gap was wide enough to climb up to the floor above. What sent chills down our spines though, was the fact that the floor we saw was a different color from all the other floors.

&#x200B;

In all the other floors that we had seen, the hallway was pink. This one was blue. And the hallway was filled with cobwebs and wooden junk. Then we saw it. The number. It was 6th floor. This was the original 6th floor that they closed off. My heart dropped to my feet. This can’t be real.

&#x200B;

Both Naru and I were scared and wanted to stay inside the elevator. However, Naru said she needed to pee. I had half the mind to tell her to just let it out right there, it was better than getting off onto the creepy floor.

&#x200B;

But, then I thought, don’t be silly, just climb out, get to the fire exit, and then we can tell our coach and our teammates and laugh about it.

&#x200B;

Naru was shorter than me and would have a harder time climbing out, so I climbed out first and was going to pull her up. But as soon as I was out, the elevator door closed on me. We both screamed but in a split second, only my voice was left.

&#x200B;

I tried to comfort myself, maybe it wasn’t haunted? Of course, it was, what other reasons were there for them to close it off? I had to get out of there as soon as possible.

&#x200B;

I rushed to the fire exit to get out there. I pushed. Nothing. It was stuck. It won’t open. I looked through the glass opening of the door and saw brick tiles. The floor was walled up.  My heart started to race. I started to panic. What if I’m stuck here?

&#x200B;

The window in the hallway of this floor was also blocked by a bunch of wooden planks. And even if I took the time to clear them out, the tiny window covered in thick black slime may not open. So, I walked into the hallway of this legendary closed-off 6th floor.

&#x200B;

I tried to open each dorm room’s door one by one. They were all locked. I gasp when I saw it. A door to the room where the girl was murdered. I knew because the top half of the door and the surrounding wall were completely charred. The girl was burned to death inside this dorm.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, the door opened by itself. I was scared I could throw up.  I peeked into the room as if I was on autopilot turned to the wall of the room and saw it.

&#x200B;

It was a… humanoid creature. Completely black, like a charred animal. It was clinging to a wall like a spider. Then it turned its head vertically upside down to look at me. It had cockroaches in its mouth. As soon as I saw its bright red eyes, I rushed out of the room and slammed the door.

&#x200B;

I ran, while also quickly checking the knobs of some of the doors I passed to see if any would open. I could hear the door of the burnt room swing opened behind me. Then, I found one open door. I went inside and tried to lock the door. I could hear the creature crawling toward the room I was in.

&#x200B;

The room inside was old, dirty, and musty. I then saw the sliding glass door that lead to a small balcony. It was covered in a weird green goo stain. I had a bit of a hard time opening it, but I used all my force and it did slide open eventually. Once I was out on the small balcony, I looked down.

&#x200B;

I saw that the floor below me had a bigger balcony. It was probably the 3rd floor where the important guests stayed. It had a table and chairs on it too.

&#x200B;

So, if I was on the old 6th floor, then that’s 3 stories fall onto that balcony. I remembered a girl who was my senior who fell from her two stories house and broke her ankle and could not walk again let alone swim.

&#x200B;

I weighed my options, then suddenly I heard a fast scratching noise from outside the door. I realized I needed to move. So I ripped out the mattress from the bed. I got a surge of adrenaline or something, but I just threw the mattress down on the balcony below.

&#x200B;

The mattress crashed into the coffee table and chairs of the VIP balcony. I then threw blankets, pillows, and anything soft I could find in the room that I hoped was going to cushion my fall.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, a woman came out of the balcony on the VIP floor and looked up at me. She asked me what I was doing. When she realized I was going to jump. She yelled, “wait, don’t!”

&#x200B;

I heard a loud bang behind me like a door was burst open. I didn’t turn to look, I just maintained eye contact with the woman below and yelled, “Catch me!” and jumped. I could feel something coming from behind me, and something sharp did make contact with the back of my shirt, but I was able to escape.

&#x200B;

15 minutes later, I was sitting in the Dorm Manager’s office, which was on the first floor of the male dorm. I thought for sure they weren’t going to believe me. But they did. And that somehow made me feel worse.

&#x200B;

The dorm’s manager was talking to my coach the entire time as if I wasn’t even in the room. He apologized to my coach, not to me. While my coach was the one apologizing to him profusely as if it was us who did anything wrong.

&#x200B;

The dorm’s manager said something along the line of, we did so much already, we walled up the entrance to the stairway, and we changed the floor numbers. He then yawned and stretched, and said that he guessed he had to wall up the elevator openings too.

&#x200B;

So, a police officer was there, a nurse was there, my coach was there, the dorm manager was there, and two teachers were there. They all believed me. Know for sure there was a ghost or some demonic creature on that closed-off floor the entire time. But they were all like, oopsie.

&#x200B;

And to put the cherry on top of all this, **I had to go back up to our room on the new 6th floor and sleep there.** There was nowhere else to sleep. We couldn’t afford a hotel. Our bus will come to pick us up in two days. Good thing that all my friends believed me, (really, not a single person didn’t believe me) so they agreed to use the elevator with me.

&#x200B;

Later that night, after our teammates started to fall asleep one by one, I finally laid down on the bed. I slept sideways, and as soon as my left ear hit the pillow, that was when I heard it. The fast scratching sound coming from the floor below. Like she was trying to make her way up to me.

&#x200B;

I was horrified and was not going to suffer through that, so I asked Naru to go downstairs with me. We slept on the sofa in the lobby of the male dorm the whole night. The front desk ladies of the male dorm tried to stop us but allowed us when I just glared at them. I think they knew what I went through and reluctantly allowed it.
