Part 4:
 
Having nearly died at the hands of Halliburton and his army of the undead, AGAIN, I’d grown weary of that insidious cemetery. Some goes for Graveyard Gary. March Break couldn’t have come soon enough. Being a teenage Sleether, some downtime was required. Maybe some fun, too. 
 
Craving coffee and a sandwich, I went downtown to the local café. Trouble was brewing. Looking  back, I should’ve expected it. The lowly town of Gulp is teeming with monsters. But they blend in. Hard to spot. Even for a Sleether. 

Sandwich and coffee in hand, I sat by the big bay window, and relaxed, watching the townsfolk saunter by – students, mill workers, business people, mothers and children – going wherever they needed to go. The sandwich was tasty, and I devoured it. The coffee was strong and savory and good. Today, I hoped, would be a fun-filled day. 

Wrong.

“Hey!”
 
I looked up so quickly my neck nearly snapped.
 
“Hey!”
 
I gasped. 

A dark, hooded figure was meddling with a mother and child. It was hideous, going in and out of focus like a B-movie horror villain. “Hey!” the hooded figure hollered in a croaky voice. “Hey!”
 
The creature was roughly four-feet tall, shrouded in shadows, sickly and gaunt. It was floating freely, directly behind the mother and child, who were halfway out the door.
 
“Hey!” The hooded figure heckled. “Hey!”
 
The mother stopped, her frail face turning ghost-white. With fearful blue eyes, she studied her surroundings, looking past the hooded figure. Her nose twitched. Her mouth shriveled as though sucking a lemon. “Let’s go, Sweetie,” she said in a small voice. The child pestered as they left. 

The hooded figure followed.  
 
Watching the creature pass through the stained-glass door was alarming. By now, the café was bustling. To my dismay, those hooded hoodlums had infested the place, causing a nuisance, leaching onto customers, poking and prodding. The customers, seemingly unaware, simply stared at their devices while sipping fancy drinks, oblivious to the monstrosities mocking them. 

Trying no to scream but afraid I might, I turned my attention to my coffee, gripping the warm mug with shaky hands. I saw one float past me, and shuddered. “Not now,” I complained. “Please. No more monsters.” 
 
Something nudged me. 

“Hey!”

I turned.  

Directly behind me was a grim-looking ghoul. It exposed a tray of treacherous teeth, long and sharp and coffee-colored, and stank of fried fish and corpse. 

“Hey!” 

The monster poked me with its claw-like fingers.

“Hey!”

Panic punched me in the gut. Gobsmacked, I stared, mouth ajar, like a fool. Unbeknownst to me, I was drooling. Couldn't help it. The monster was hypnotizing me. 

A teenage girl I recognized from school glanced over from behind her laptop, shot me a dirty look, then returned to whatever she was doing. The friend she was with giggled.

I nearly died. My heart sank to the pit of my stomach. Coming here was a mistake. That much was obvious. Time to leave. Wearily, I wiped the drool from my chin, then headed towards the exit, all-to-aware of the hooded creature creeping behind me. My feet were blocks of ice, my blood as cold as Arctic snow. As I approached the entrance, I tripped and spilled someone’s drink. 

“So sorry,” I said to the cranky customer, who told me to eff off. 

Suddenly, everyone was staring at me. Like I was stupid or something. Like it was my fault the café was haunted. Like those malevolent monsters draped in dark hoodies were my fault. For a terrible moment, I simply stood there, looking like the fool they believed me to be. 

“Be strong, son,” my father’s voice chimed in.

I didn’t feel strong. I felt small, insignificant. Frightened. Finally, I regained some composure, and kept walking.

“Hey!”

Something poked me. Hard. I froze. Mind and body went numb. Slowly, I turned and faced the monster.
 
 “Hey!” 

I stood horrified, face to face with the hooded figure. The monster kept poking me, staring at me with its dark and doomful glare. I tried to retreat, and failed. Instead, I stumbled over a baby stroller. An old man muttered something about ‘kids these days.’ Clearly, the old man didn’t see the cloaked caper attached to him, draining his life force. 
 
But I did.

They were everywhere, moving in and out of focus, poking and prodding and causing a disturbance. 

Something leached onto my leg. Something strong. I stifled a scream. Attached to my leg was a demon, slurping the sludge from my boots, and delighting in it. The sound was sickening. So was the smell. With all the strength I could muster, I stomped it. The thing croaked and cried as I made a dash towards the door.

“Hey!”
 
Oh, how I hated that word. 
 
“They won’t harm you,” Father whispered. “But they will try.”

I paused to catch my breath. It seemed like an eternity. Clarity came. I completed my walk of shame, ignoring the prying eyes and provoking poltergeists, until I reached the exit. Guess who walked into the café, looking like he just got out of bed? 

Graveyard Gary. 

“Sam,” he snickered, with eyes as large as pizzas. “Fancy seeing you here.” His jovial demeanor was a slap in the face.
 
“Hey!”
 
A monster latched onto Gary. Gary grabbed the grim ghoul by its throat and squeezed. 
 
“Hey!” 

Then, POOF! It evaporated. The sound was like a gunshot.  

People hit the ground. All eyes turned. The café was cemetery-quiet. The town of Gulp was still recovering from a recent shooting – the third this year – and everyone was on edge.
 
“Relax!” Gary chuckled, rubbing his belly. “Go back to whatever it is yer doing. Nothing to see here!”
 
Nothing to see, except those dark and dreadful monsters, of course. But smartly, I kept quiet.

Gary shrugged. “Heys,” he said, holding his place in the lineup. “Annoying lil buggers.”
 
I was dumbfounded. None of this made sense. Halliburton was bad enough. Now this? Deeply perplexed, I blurted out:

“What the hell are Heys?”
 
Gary giggled. He remained put, standing in line. I folded my arms in protest, and sighed. Once again, I found myself at the front of the line. Gary ordered a ham sandwich and a peppermint tea. Without hesitating, I offered to pay, and ordered myself a fresh pastry for dessert. Gary seemed pleased, patting my backside as I paid. I could’ve killed him right then and there.
 
He led me to the furthest booth, tucked in the corner, away from prying ears. Gary went straight to work, gobbling the sandwich, stealing sips of tea in between bites, happy as a pig on a spit. Meanwhile, the cloaked creepers crept about, going from customer to customer. 

I waited. The sound of his chewing was gnawing on my nerves. As were the monsters. My legs were shaking, and wouldn’t let up. My fingers tapping frantically on the table. Finally, when I could no longer take it, I repeated the million-dollar question: 

“What the hell are Heys?”
 
“Heys,” he said, not covering his mouth as he spoke, “are trolls. Desperate for attention.”
 
“Where do they come from?”

Gary rolled his eyes. “Hell. Where else?”

I gobbled my pastry, taking time to digest what he said. Trolls. Just what I needed.  
 
“Heys,” Gary continued, “don’t know they’re dead. They think people see them. And they HATE being ignored. Pathetic beings, really. Problem is....” He paused dramatically, relishing every minute of my misery. “They cause havoc. Especially while people are driving.”
 
I choked. My sister died in an automobile accident. She was on a fieldtrip. To think these meddlesome monsters had anything to do with her death was unfathomable. 

A lump wedged in my throat and stayed there. My face turned beet-red. Gary whacked me. Then he winked. To him, this was fun. I, on the other hand, was horrified. 

A hooded figure was hovering behind Gary, going in and out of focus. A Hey. To my astonishment, Gary dropped a piece of ham on the floor, and recited a prayer. The Hey zoomed down and gobbled it greedily. Then it gagged and groaned, clutching its skinny neck in revulsion. Weird thing was: the slice of ham remained on the floor.
 
Anxiety arrived. My mind was moving in all the wrong directions. My body tensed. This was madness. Even for Gulp. Heys? Why hadn't I noticed them before? 

“They’re starving,” Gary said matter-of-factly, as he dropped another slice.
 
The Heys circled like flies, fighting over the food like pariahs. Suddenly, our table was under siege. They gnawed and gashed and griped. One was murdered, POOF! More gunshot. More outcry from the remaining customers. Ugh. These trolls spelled bad news. And I was smack dab in the middle. 
 
All the while, Gary slurped his tea, wiped his mouth on a napkin, and belched. He made obscene sexual gestures as he lifted his butt cheek and let out a squeaker. I gagged. I wanted to smack that smirk off his pudgy face. While stewing in Gary’s flatulence (not to mention the sinister stench of the Heys), Gary continued his grotesque game of childish charades. 
 
My hatred for him was unwavering. But there was no one else to turn to, so I remained seated, searching for answers.

“How do we stop them?” I managed to ask, in between bouts of nausea. 

Gary stopped. His eyes were wet with concern. He kicked away the circling creatures, and sighed. 

“Stop them?” He hung his humongous head, as if obvious. “We [can’t.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)
