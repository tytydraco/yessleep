A crashing sound that reverberated from outside startled me awake. I groaned to myself as I rolled over and reached out my hand, searching for my phone. I felt the cold surface of my phone and pulled it up to eye level. After double-tapping the screen, the time popped up. 3:47 am. I shook my head and threw the blankets off of me, slowly crawling out of bed. My feet hit the cold floor, making me shudder slightly as I made my way to the bathroom. 



As I was coming back to my room, another loud sound came from outside, causing me to jump. I entered my room and walked over to the window peeking out. I scanned the neighborhood, seeing nothing unusual. My heart stopped as  I noticed an uncanny figure standing at the top of my street. One thing I should mention is that I lived in a rather rural area, with only five houses on my street with quite a distance between each house. The area is slightly wooded, taking about fifteen minutes to reach the closest civilized area. I watched the figure carefully, and the panic sank in as it made its way down the street. Something was terribly wrong. The way it walked and held itself was off, almost inhuman. It walked slowly, its body contorting slightly as it did so and he was so tall, much taller than the average man. As he approached my house, a pit grew in my stomach. He paused between my house and my neighbors, then walked between the houses and disappeared. I crossed the room back to my bed where I picked up my phone. I unlocked it and called Remi, my fiance, who was staying at his friend’s for the night. After, the third ring he answered.



“Is everything okay, baby?” his voice was low and raspy and I knew I had woken him up.



“Can you come home? There’s someone walking around the neighborhood and I'm getting scared.”



I could hear shuffling over the phone and I immediately knew he was going to come home.



“Yes, I’m getting my stuff and I’m headed home in less than a minute. Can you still see him?”



“No. He disappeared between the neighbors and our house.”



“Okay, I need you to check all doors and windows, take the Glock with you.”



“Okay, please hurry.”



“I’ll be home in 10 minutes. I love you.”



“I love you too,” I said before I hung up.



I walked over to the nightstand, opened the drawer, pulled out the Glock, and made sure that it was loaded. I went back to the window and looked out again but there was nothing there. I let out a shaky breath as I checked all the upstairs windows to make sure I locked them before slowly going downstairs. I went to every door and window, doing the same thing with them, then going back upstairs and to the bedroom window. I knew Remi would be home in the next minute or so and felt the panic subside. I looked down at my phone briefly and then back to the window. My body froze, almost screaming as the figure was now standing in front of my house, facing me. It didn't move as it stood there and I wasn’t sure if it was even breathing. It was hard to make out any details as the street was almost completely dark. There were no street lights in front of my house, only a few were scattered across the neighborhood. I wasn’t sure what to do, what was I supposed to do in a situation like this?  I watched and watched, praying that Remi would get home before anything happened. I quickly pulled out my phone and texted him.



‘He’s standing outside the house.’



‘I’ll be there in a minute, keep the gun on you at all times,’



I put my phone back down and returned my eyes to the window. What the fuck? The figure was now gone, no trace that it had ever been there. I scanned the neighborhood, hoping to see him. It would make me feel a hell of a lot better if I knew where he was. Nothing could possibly go wrong if I knew where he was. I kept looking outside until I saw headlights coming down the street and into the driveway. I ran down the stairs, almost tripping to meet Remi at the door. I placed my phone on the little table that sat by our front door and unlocked it as soon as his foot touched the porch and he quickly came inside, locking the door behind him. He pulled me into a hug and I let out a breath as I melted into him. He kissed the top of my head before lifting mine to meet his gaze. He looked tired, dark bags under his eyes nonetheless he still looked happy to see me. He had a dark red t-shirt on and a pair of black sweatpants that fit him perfectly. His blonde hair was pushed back off his face and you could tell he had rushed to get home. He looked gorgeous in every sense of the word. I wanted to go upstairs and lie down with him. He was my safe space and when I was with him, I felt like nothing could go wrong. He placed his phone and keys next to mine on the table.



“I saw nothing when I pulled into the neighborhood.”



“He disappeared when I was texting you. I have no clue where he is.”



“Let's go back upstairs. I’m sure everything is okay now.”



“I’m sorry for calling you so late, I know you were at Adam’s house and were excited to spend some time with him during the off-season.”



“Why are you sorry? Your safety comes first.”



I smiled at his response. With the gun in one hand, I placed my free hand on his chest and got on my tiptoes to kiss him. He kissed me back, his fingers tangled in my hair. He took the gun from my hand and placed it into his waistband, before wrapping his arms around my waist and hoisting me up. I wrapped myself around him, laying my head on his shoulder. He moved his arm and his hand lifted my head. I smiled at him brightly as I leaned forward and kissed him again. The kiss lasted for maybe a minute before we pulled apart for air. I let out a giggle as I looked into his eyes, his eyes filled with love. He spun in a circle, causing the both of us to laugh. I loved the little moments like this.



“Alright baby, let’s go get some sleep.” He whispered in my ear before placing a kiss on it.



“Sounds good to me, gorgeous. I’m tired as hell.”



He chuckled softly, as I placed my head back on his shoulder, kissing it gently while taking me upstairs. The relief I had felt when Remi arrived quickly vanished. The sound of breaking glass pierced the silence as we made it to the top of the stairs. It came from the back of the house which told us he had broken our glass back door. He placed me down on my feet; I froze and looked up at Remi who was reaching for the gun in his waistband. In a sudden movement, he was pushing me to the room closest to us and locking the door. We stood in silence, listening for any sound that would give us any clue as to what was going on. There was a crunching sound as the intruder stepped into the house. The house was quiet before we heard it started moving around the first floor of the house. 



I looked over to Remi who was deep in thought before he glanced over at me. He placed a finger over his mouth indicating that I needed to remain silent. He grabbed my hand, walked towards the door, and opened the door slowly. He led me out of the room, moving so that he was behind me and now pushing me forward. We silently but quickly moved towards the back of the house to get as far away as possible from the intruder. We made it into our bedroom, Remi locked the door behind him and then turned to face me. I didn’t know what to say to him at the moment, nothing but fear on my mind. He kept me close to him, pressing me into his side, while I stared blankly at the door with my head leaning onto his arms. My hands were shaking uncontrollably and my body felt like it was on fire. Something about this felt extremely off and I guess it would considering what was going on. My throat was dry and my heart was racing in my chest, so much so that it hurt. 



“Remi, I left my phone downstairs.”



Remi stopped and stared at me for a moment before patting his own pockets, his face contorting to shock.



“So did I.” 



“Remi? What the fuck is going on?” I whispered.



“I don’t know.” 



It was only a matter of time before my mind would shut down from the panic. It was unfortunate, but it's how I've always responded in traumatic situations. Remi was more levelheaded and logical, He could stay strong and take control in situations like these. Before I could say anything else, Remi was already at the window, tugging it upwards but it didn’t move. He tried repeatedly until he gave up in frustration, reeling back to punch the window but stopping himself before his fist hit the window. We had never been able to open that window, the paint had sealed it shut.  If he was getting nervous, it wasn’t showing. His face remained stoic which comforted me, I knew that as long as he was by my side I would be okay. We could hear the intruder making its way up the stairs, its footsteps heavy as he came to the top of the stairs. The sound of a door opening was heard, and we knew it was looking for us. It became very clear that whoever was in our house was not here to rob us. We were under attack. The intruder went from door to door and as he got closer; we needed to think of a plan. Remi gripped the gun tighter and held it so that if he needed to shoot, he could.



“Honey, I want you to stay with me as much as possible.”



“Remi, I’m scared.” I whimpered as I shuffled closer to him, latching onto him.



He ran his hand through my hair and leaned down to kiss my head which gave me some comfort. It was the little moments like this that Reminded me of why I loved him so much.



“I know baby, but I need you to be strong for me.”



“I will but what if something happens to you?”



“We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”



I didn’t really like that answer but I wasn’t about to argue with him. As the last remaining doors continued to be slammed open, I could hear my heart beating in my chest. Remi perked up, thinking of something. He pointed at the dresser and motioned for me to follow him hiding ourselves between the dresser and the wall. He understood we were cornering ourselves but it was the best idea that he could come up with at the moment. My back was pushed up against the wall, Remi’s body covered me from being seen. The back of Remi’s body was touching my mine and, I felt comfort from the warmth that radiated from him. He glanced back at me, offering me a soft smile which I managed to return. Guilt flooded over me as I felt like I had dragged him into this mess. It made me wonder what would’ve happened if I didn’t call him to come home.



“we’ll be okay, Darling,” Remi whispered warmly, as he reached for my hand. The only thing I could do was nod.



The conversation was cut short, as the doorknob twisted. He had reached our room, and I fully began to panic. We could see the shadow of his feet slipping under the door. He stood there, waiting and we could hear his heavy breathing. There was a whistling sound whenever he inhaled, followed by a groan occasionally when he breathed out. I could feel sweat form on my forehead, as my hands began to shake again. My legs felt weak and leaned onto Remi. Remi jumped as the door splintered as it came off its hinges, pushing me further into the wall behind me. He quickly regained his composure, giving me a quick glance before turning his attention back to the door. I didn’t know Remi could see and I was too scared to look myself. The silence was deafening before a voice rang out.



“I can smell you.” The intruder growled, his voice guttural.



I had never heard anything like that before and it took everything in me to not run. Remi’s grip on my hand tightened as we stayed hidden beside the dresser. I pressed my face into Remi’s back as I braced for the worst. I could feel the muscles in his back tense as he raised his arms. The horror set in as I realized what he was about to do. He was going to shoot. I lifted my head to see what was folding in front of me. My breath hitched in my throat as I finally saw the intruder. Now Remi was tall, standing at 6’3 but the man who stood in front of us was much taller. He had straggly, shoulder-length hair that looked like it hadn't washed in years. He stood hunched over, his arms disproportionately long. He was dirty and the smell that came off of him made me gag. Remi had the gun raised, and he began pulling the trigger, ready to do whatever he needed to protect us.



“Don’t come any closer,” Remi demanded.



“Or what?” The man taunted.



“Find out.” Remi hissed.



The man let out a rasp of a laugh that sent chills down my spine. I could feel Remi tense even more as the man took a step closer. Remi took a deep breath and changed his stance into something more defensive. It happened in a matter of seconds; the man took a large step forward, nearly closing the distance between us. Remi fired a shot, hitting the man successfully in the chest. Everything went silent, before a sharp pain shot through my ears. Remi was yelling something but it was muffled, the ringing in my ears triumphing causing me to clamp my hands over my ears, my eyes stuck on the scene in front of me. Tears poured freely down my face, sobbing as I buried my face back into Remi’s back.  The man froze looking down at his chest before laughing again. He continued his advances towards us, causing Remi to fire off two more rounds. The man stumbled backward, clutching his chest. Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion, Remi used this opportunity to grab my arm, pushing past the man. We ran out of the room and into the hallway. The man gave chase, cornering and pushing us into the guest bedroom. Remi slammed the door shut behind us, turning around to face me. The look on his was pure horror.



“What the fuck is that?” I cried.



“Your guess is as good as mine.”



Remi quickly released the magazine to check how much ammo we had left.



“We have seven shots left.”



I walked to a corner of the room and slid down the wall. I pulled my knees into my chest and I cried into them. I was shaking like a leaf, Remi moved closer to me. He kneeled in front of me and pried my head from my hands, holding my face in my hands.



“Honey, I know this is difficult but I need you to calm down.”



“I.. I” I tried to speak but I couldn’t get it out.



“Breathe with me.” He whispered, taking in a deep breath.



I tried to take a deep breath in but I couldn’t, shaking my head and sobbing louder. The world felt like it was ending, I couldn’t breathe, there was a psychopath in our house that had been shot three times and was still alive and kicking.



“I know you can do it, baby, just take it slow. Let’s try again, okay?” His voice was warm and sweet and it had a soothing effect over me.



He took another deep breath and this time I took one in as well. My tears dried with every breath we took together. Remi smiled and pulled me into a hug, working effectively to calm me down more. After a minute, he pulled away, kissing me quickly before holding out his hand to me. I reached out my hand, interlacing our fingers together as I pulled myself up with his help.



“I’m proud of you, love. You did such a good job.”



“Thank you, Remi.”



“Anything for my woman.”



 I wish I had just gone to a friend’s house or to Adam’s house, where Remi had been staying. None of this would be happening. The guilt crushed me even harder. Guilt for bringing Remi into this mess. If hadn’t called him, he wouldn’t be here. He wouldn’t have shot someone, worried about protecting me, about dying. The man was pacing back and forth down the hallway. We couldn’t leave the room unless we wanted to come face-to-face with the intruder. He was banging on the walls and doors, laughing now and then. Nothing about this made sense. Remi had shot the man THREE times, and it only slowed him down for maybe a minute. It was dawning on us we would need to act quickly. Without being able to leave the room, there wasn’t much for us to do. It was a waiting game. Remi walked over to the window, looking out briefly before, trying to open it. Nothing. It wouldn’t even budge. He let out a frustrated yell, punching the window. His chest heaved as his hand reared back, blood dripping from his knuckles. 



“Remi, stop!”



“I can’t stand this! You’re in danger and there’s nothing I can do about it!” He yelled.



“Remi, please.” My voice shook as I spoke.



“NO.” He yelled, taking a step closer to me. “I…I FUCK.” He yelled again.



He took a few steps back again, his body snapping to the side as he punched the wall. I just stared at him, It was rare for Remi to act like this. The few times I’d seen him this mad was after hockey games that didn’t go too well, which again was very rare. I wasn’t sure what to do, honestly, there wasn’t much for me to do. This could play one of two ways, his anger would either fuck us over or it would get us through this hell.  I walked behind Remi, slipping my hand under his shirt and resting on his bare back. I could feel his muscles relax slightly at my touch.



“Remi, baby. I’m just as scared as you are but we need to slow down and think.”



“Slow down? We don’t have time to slow down.” His voice was still filled with frustration.



“If you keep lashing out like that, you are going to get both of us killed.”



He let out a sigh before, looking down at me. “You’re right, I’m sorry.”



He turned around, facing me and I moved my hand on his bicep, giving it a soft squeeze. He placed a hand on my lower back as he let out another sigh, resting his forehead against mine. Our heads jerked to the door as a scratching sound, came from the hallway.  He was running his nails along them. It was a deep sound like he had claws.



“Remi, I don’t think he’s a human”, the statement sounded stupid as it came out of my mouth but it was the only plausible thing I could come up with.



“That’s not possible, Juile.”



“No, but think about it. You shot him three times and it barely slowed him down. He’s faster than normal people and he’s fucking tall. And by the way, he looks, it's not human. For fucks sake Remington, he’s taunting us right now.” 



Remi ran a hand through his hair and began pacing back and forth as he stared down at the floor. He stopped in front of me, grabbing my arm and pulling me into him. His arms wrapped around me in a warm embrace. I melted into him, my head resting on his chest. His heart was beating fast and hard, almost like it would burst out of his chest. We stood there for a while, hugging each other, hoping this nightmare would end soon. My heart dropped as Remi let out a sob, his body shaking against mine. I looked up at him; he looked so sad, so broken. In the years, that we had been together I had never once seen him cry. I could feel tears well up in my own eyes as we looked at each other. Nothing was said. Nothing needed to be said. The look in his eyes gave everything away. He moved us to the bed, both of us sitting on the edge, facing the door. He held both of my hands in his, looking deep into my eyes.



“I need you to promise me something,” Remi whispered somberly.



“Yes?”



“If I die…”



“Stop,” I demanded, I couldn’t believe what he was saying. “We aren’t doing this right now.”



He blinked at me before nodding his head.



“I love you, Julie, so much.” 



“I love you too honey”



There was a shattering sound from the hallway, causing me to jump onto Remi. He grabbed me, holding me close to him. It sounded like the man had knocked a picture off the wall. I jumped again as the man pounded on the door repeatedly.



“Just come out, I’m not going to hurt you.” He screamed through the door.



Remi’s hand clamped over my mouth, knowing that I was most likely wanting to scream. The banging didn’t stop, it went on for a few minutes before Remi placed me down on the bed and stood up. He pulled out the gun and aimed at the door.



“Remi, what the fuck are you doing?” I hissed.



He didn’t answer, shooting twice. through the door. The man yelled out in anger and pain. Well, at least Remi hit the thing.



“MOTHERFUCKER!” The man roared, his banging intensifying.



I wasn’t sure how much longer the door was going to hold the man back; he was far stronger than anyone else I had ever met. I ran to the bathroom, that was connected to the guest room, turning on the light and shutting the door. I motioned for him to move and hide behind a desk, that was placed to the side of the bedroom door. We stayed hidden there, as quiet as possible as we waited for the man to break through. It took him longer than I expected it to. It seemed like the bullets did cause some harm. The door opened, well more like kicked down, and began searching the room, he laughed as he saw the bathroom light on. 



“So stupid,” It muttered under its breath. 



 Once the man made it to the bathroom door and began to kick the door in, I grabbed Remi’s and ran out of the room. We ran down the hall, trying, to get closer to the stairs when the man ran back out of the room.



“There you are!” He exclaimed as he sprinted towards us.



Remi fired two more shots, but the gun jammed at the third shot.



“Fuck” Remi muttered as he cleared the jam and fired the last two remaining bullets in the chamber.



The man slowed briefly before charging us with a yell. We were so close to the stairs but at the rate he was running, he would catch us before we could make it out the door. With no other choice, we were pushed into the last guest bedroom we had. Again for the third time tonight, we locked ourselves in this room. We waited and waited but nothing ever came. It was silent. Too silent. There was a sudden running sound, that went through the hallway and down the stairs. Was he leaving? We could hear the man start fumbling around downstairs. He was yelling and laughing as he destroyed everything he could. Glass shattered, furniture was thrown, drawers opened and slammed shut, as the contents were being thrown around. He was toying with us. 



Everything Remi and I had built was being destroyed. I moved over to him. He was sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. I stood in front of him, between his legs. Placing my hands on his face on each side of his face and lifted it gently. He was crying again. I leaned down forward and kissed his lips, he kissed me back, putting his hands on my waist and pulled me closer. I hugged him, his head resting on my chest as I played with his hair. If we were going to die tonight, I wanted this to be the last thing I remembered.  The night trailed on for what felt like forever. We were exhausted and running out of ideas on what to do next.



“What if we try to make a break for it?” I whispered.

 

“I… I don’t know Julie.”



“I know it's not the smartest idea, but what else can we do? He broke the back door, all we’d have to do is get there and we’d be out of this hell.”



“if anything were to happen to you, I don’t know what I’d do.”



“Remi, this might be the only chance we have.”



“Okay, but stay close to me.”



“I promise.”



We left the room silently and trudged closer to the top of the stairs. We stayed close to the wall for cover. My arm wrapped around his arm as moved, careful not to make any noise. The house was silent again as we edged the top of the stairs. I bit back a scream as we peered around the corner to see the man appear at the bottom of the stairs, a sickening smile on his face. He crept up the stairs as we moved back in response. He had something in his hand but I couldn’t tell what it was. Whatever it was, he threw it straight at us as he reached the midway point. Remi was prepared for it, somehow knowing that it was going to hit me. Remi’s hand flew over my mouth to as I felt something pierce my side. Whatever it was tore straight through my skin and landed on the floor behind us.



 At first, all I felt was a wet, hot, sticky feeling. Blood. After a few seconds, it felt like a sharp, burning pain causing my side to be on fire. I let out a muffled scream as Remi’s other arm came behind me and pressed onto the wound as hard as he could to stop the bleeding. My vision blurred and my breathing came in as gasp as the pain riddled my body. I cried as he pulled me into the nearest room, my back against his chest, my feet dragging. I had no clue how he had done it but he somehow did it; he placed me down on the bed as he pulled his hand from my mouth. He kept his left hand on the wound as he spoke to me in a low whisper. 



“I need you to stay as quiet as possible for me. This is really going to hurt but I need to do this.”



All I could do was nod my head weakly in response as he pulled his hand from my side. I felt dizzy and like I was going to pass out and throw up all at the same time as he reached down and grabbed a t-shirt. In one swift movement, he tore the shirt into one long strip. He walked back to the bed and placed the torn shirt on the bed next to me before sitting down next to me.



“Hold on to my thigh.” He whispered in my ear.



He lifted my shirt and started stuffing the wound with the torn shirt. My eyes squeezed shut and my fingers dug into his thigh and I screamed again. The pain was blinding and my breath caught in my throat.

  


 After a minute I looked back up at Remi who was grimacing. I could tell that Remi was struggling with causing me further pain and damn, he looked like hell. His hair was disheveled, falling over his forehead and coated in sweat. He had a somber look on his face and the bags under his eyes looked even darker. His clothing had small tears in them and he had scratches and cuts on him, dried blood coating them. My blood covered his left hand up to his forearm, it was even under his fingernails.  Regardless of the fact, that the magazine was empty, Remi kept the gun tucked into his waistband. We were at a standstill, neither one of us knew what to do. The night felt never-ending, and I just wanted it to end. There was a loud thud in the hallway bringing us back to reality, a raging psychopath who couldn’t die had somehow trapped us in our own home. 



There was a shuffling sound outside the door, he was right in front of the door. My eyes stayed locked on Remi, waiting to see what he was going to do. Remi looked defeated like he was out of ideas on what to do. Who knows how long we stood there, just waiting for something to happen? Remi walked over to the dresser and began pulling it to the door, barricading it. He pulled the nightstand after and as he was pulling the bed towards the door; the doorknob jiggled. Remi stopped dead in his tracks and my eyes snapped to the door but Remi quickly returned to moving the bed. It only took a few seconds for the banging to start.  



Remi moved back to grab something else when the intruder began to kick the door down. I jumped back, stumbling some when Remi grabbed me, stopping me from falling. He pulled me behind him in a protective stance before he spoke in a heartbreaking tone.



“I love you, Julie.” He whispered, turning back to face me. 



“I love you too, Remi,” I whispered with tears running down my face at the realization that if not both then one of us was about to die.

 

He leaned down and placed his hand on my face, and kissed me. I kissed him back, my hand wrapping around his wrist. After a few seconds, we pulled away, Remi gave me a soft smile, that gorgeous smile that I loved dearly. I gave him a weak smile as the banging grew louder and louder, shifting the furniture that was against the door.



“Fight to the death,” Remi whispered.



I nodded in response and prepared myself as much as I could. With one last kick, the man sent the furniture flying, causing both of us to move in opposite directions. I groaned as a sharp pain radiated throughout my side from my quick movement. The man stood in the doorway, an evil smile on his face. His eyes were wide and wild, just staring at us before making his first move, laughing as he did so. I watched in horror as Remi charged the man, their bodies colliding violently. 



They both stumbled back before regaining their stances. Remi threw a punch, but the intruder was quicker, a sickening crunch echoing as his fist slammed into Remi’s face. The impact sent Remi back a few steps, anger written all over his face. He stood up straight, throwing his arms out slightly and his hands turned to fists. He was going to fight for the both of us and I knew he wouldn’t stop until one of them was dead. Blood dripped from Remi’s face and he looked feral, the man also followed suit and got ready to go again. Remi waited for the intruder to make the first move. The intruder lunged forward, arms outstretched, trying to tackle Remi. Remi dodged, digging his elbow into the man’s back and pushing him to the ground. The man wrapped his hand around Remi’s ankle and with a quick tug; they were both on the floor. The intruder was quickly on top of Remi, his hands placed around Remi’s neck. Remi started to fight back, his hands clawing at the man’s wrist. Remi was failing, the man was far too strong for him. Remi’s face was red, and his movements were slowing. 



Without thinking, I jumped onto the man, who was strangling my fiance. My body flew into his with an audible thud. My breath was knocked from me and I took a deep gasp in. I pushed myself off the ground and stood tall. With my newfound confidence, I was prepared for whatever came my way. I could hear Remi shuffling then felt him standing behind me. His breathing was heavy and labored but ready to fight. 



The man laughed as he pushed himself off the floor, shaking invisible dust off of him, like he was a dog. The man charged us again, something glinting in his hand as he did. I moved out of the way but Remi was too slow. He let out a yell as I turned around to see the man stabbing him. I screamed in horror as a squelching sound came when the man pulled out the knife and plunged it back into Remi. Another yell escaped Remi as he tried to fight the man off. Remi grabbed the man's wrist, in hopes of getting the man’s hands off of the handle. Remi kicked his leg out, his foot colliding with the man's knee. The man fell to one knee but before he could back up, Remi’s knee was slamming under the man's chin. The man groaned and pushed back a few feet. Remi moved back, creating as much distance between him as he could.



“What do you want from us?” Remi roared.



“Nothing.” The man responded. His answer was so cruel and evil.



“Then, why are you doing this?” Remi questioned, his voice weak.



“Because I can.” The man said matter of factly.



It was a horrifying realization that we had been going through all of this for no reason. All because the intruder could. This angered me and I could tell from the growl that came from Remi that it had the same effect. I inched backward, moving away from Remi and the intruder. A blur blew past me and I knew the man was going after Remi again. Remi let the man attack but before the man hit Remi, he reached down and grabbed a piece of wood from the floor and plunged into the base of the intruder’s neck. It hit them closer to the shoulder but still affected him. He let out a howl, grabbing his neck and falling to his knees. Remi was on the man in a matter of seconds, his fist hitting every part of the man’s body that he could. The man hardly moved, letting it happen. I have no idea how long Remi’s assault on the man lasted, it felt like forever. Remi got off the man, now covered in blood. Mine, his, the intruders, his breathing was heavy as he stood over the man. he crawled away from Remi, slowly but eventually, he stood up.



“Fucking Bitch.” The intruder mumbled as he walked through the door of the room.



We watched as the man limped out of the room, and heard him walk downstairs and out the front door. We made our way to the window, Remi had me tucked under his arm and my arm was around the back of his waist. The sun was starting to rise and as we peered out the window, a wolf was limping down the street. I looked up to Remi. He looked like shit. Bruises, blood, and sweat covered his face. There were deep purple hand marks around his neck from where he was almost strangled to death. He leaned down and kissed me. I kissed him back and wrapped my arms around him.



“I love you, Julie.”



“I love you too, Remi.”



He smiled at me. We had survived.



We still have no idea what we encountered that day. We were just happy to be alive. The police never found the guy and I’m not sure they ever will. The whole ordeal lasted a little over two hours but it felt like it was never going to end, it was the most horrifying night of my life.  The following months were rough, we had to deal with the trauma and heal from the wounds. Remi was lucky that the man hadn’t stabbed him anywhere vital. He was stabbed once, in the chest and once in the shoulder, and had a few broken ribs, and of course cuts and bruises. I had a couple of broken ribs, and luckily the wound in my side wasn’t too bad. Turns out the man had thrown a large shard of glass and missed any organs. Recovery was a bitch.  We only returned to the house three more times after that, to get anything that we wanted to take with us. We stayed with a friend for about a month before we moved about an hour away. We were both haunted by nightmares and we still do occasionally. We were both diagnosed with PTSD but are going through therapy to help cope. This happened almost two years ago and we are now happily married.
