I've been feeling more irritable lately. I don't know if it's because of the lack of success in my job hunt, no sleep, or the stress beating me into the ground.

  
It's been a few weeks since I [last wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m07hki/i_keep_getting_told_i_look_like_different_people/) about this. Trying to make sense of it all.



Now, this is a good way to recount what's happening so I don't forget. I’m starting to take a mental note of every strange event that happens and how often.



Everything is just pissing me off lately. My mood swings are getting a little out of hand, and I'm starting to see things. Or my imagination is playing tricks on me. Who knows.



At this point, I feel like something’s very wrong, but I don’t want to admit it to myself.



Small chunks of time have gone missing. So this is a good way for me to keep track.



At first, it was nothing, I'd space out for a few moments and forget what I was doing. Nothing new. Just seemed like an ordinary problem that many people had.



Now, it's getting more gradual. Thirty minutes to an hour goes missing, and I wouldn't know how I got there or what I was doing.



Which is so fucking dangerous considering I have to watch over my seven-year-old. I don’t want another potential blackout to somehow put her in danger.



I explained the tunnel vision I had last time, how my line of sight faded into the center of my gaze. Well, that's still happening, and more frequently.



If that wasn’t bad enough, I'm also starting to notice some creepy shit.



Last week, I was at the park with Zoey when I noticed someone staring in my direction. They were an older man that possessed the most menacing, and coldest scowl that peered through my soul.



His face appeared to be swelling like that of a corpse dumped in a lake, and his eyes were sinking into his puffy flesh.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was an imposter. His eyes were fake.



Not only that, they were glowing an unnatural, pale yellow that was pulsing. A low-pitched hum accompanied with a vibration became present within my skull.



It almost looked like his arms were growing, and his head was turning clockwise more and more. I couldn’t break this staring contest.



Zoey excitedly yelled, "Daddy, look at me!" as she went down the slide, and my attention shifted back to her. I look back at the man, and he's completely normal.



I reverted back to my initial thought that I was just seeing things, and repressed it. Nothing I could do.



I started my day off today with a cup of black coffee to fully stimulate my mind. My mom was working at her business and Zoey was in school so I had the place to myself.



Once I was mentally awake, I couldn’t help but think about my life lately. It truly felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.



So, I did the same thing I usually do as part of a variety of ways I like to cope with stress. The house looked messy, so I started to manically deep clean everything.



I picked up every piece of trash and used bowl or cup I could find around the place, wiped down counters, did the dishes, put laundry through, and my anxiety lessened the deeper I got in the process. Clean house, clean mind.



I was vacuuming in the living room with my headphones blaring screaming metal. Seems kind of contradictory to blast metal when I’m high-strung, but I’m weird like that.



I was coming around the corner of the sectional couch with the vacuum when I briefly noticed something in my peripheral vision. Down the dark hallway, for a split second, a shadow was roaming.



Then it was gone, sucked back into the void. Like noticing caused it to immediately scurry away.



Whispering approached me again. Vague at first, then growing but still distant. I tried really hard this time to pay attention to what I was hearing.



I thought I could make out chanting.



Then it stopped. I lied to myself again, believing it was nothing.



I can’t tell if I’m losing my grip on reality, or something more sinister is at play here.



After I cleaned the whole place, I decided to go to Safeway to pick up some groceries for the week. I was walking from my car to the doors when I saw a group of teenagers hanging out at the outside tables to the right.



One of them was staring at me.



He had a smirk on his face. Not in the way a rowdy teenager would, this was different.



His lips were contorted, twisting upward on one side to reach lifeless eyes that were three times as tall as they should’ve been.



As I met his stare, his irises flared a sickly pale yellow, like dying embers. A low hum started to shake the inside of my skull, so sharp and cold.



I looked away, my heart pounding, as his eyes continued to fixate on me. A vignette had started around the edges of my perception, but faded soon after.



Soon after, I had everything loaded into my shopping cart and I was ready to go. At the checkout line, the cashier was scanning my items.



We were sharing some small talk, and I was just about to pay when I looked down and there was a large kitchen knife in my hand.



“You know, this is crazy, but you look a lot like the guy from that *Man of Steel* movie, I forget his name though…” She said to me.



I didn’t question where the knife had come from. Without a second thought, I snapped and drove the blade *into her neck.*



She stumbled backward and hopelessly clenched the giant gash that I put there. Eyes draining of life, she started panicking and flailing backward.



Screams erupted and people ran away as they noticed her gurgling and reaching towards them, hoping someone could save her from the nightmare that took her just now.



I slowly followed behind in anticipation as she collapsed to the floor. I stood over her like an aggressive menace while she stared into my eyes with a pleading look as her life was being snuffed out.



All she could get out was, *“Why?”* as blood pooled around her.



I said nothing. I just stood there and smiled.



And then—



—she was standing in front of me, holding out my receipt.



“Have a great day,” she told me.



Did I even respond to what she had said prior? I can’t recall.



She gave me an awkward smile. Probably because I just stood there looking like an idiot. The knife was gone.



I left the store and got back to my car, obsessively checking my hands for blood or any sharp objects.



I fumbled around my jacket pockets and found a note. It was from Zoey. It said “I love you!”



But the handwriting was too neat. Not the best, but a solid step up from a child’s writing.



I swear I saw this note earlier and it looked just like her normal handwriting.



I broke down in tears, my head hanging over the steering wheel. Tunnel vision began to set in again as I was sniffling and wiping the tears from my eyes. I blacked out.



I awoke in my car, in the same place. Fuck, I totally lost track of time. How long have I just been sitting here for?



I looked at the clock in my car. It was nearly time to go get Zoey from school.



The pickup line always gets packed when school gets out so I was definitely gonna be a few minutes late. Hope she wasn’t too upset about it.



When she was walking up to my car, I couldn’t tell if my disoriented eyes were playing tricks on me, but I couldn’t make out all the details of her face. As she got closer, I realized that was just an illusion my mind displayed.



She got in and did indeed look upset. I got her ice cream though, so we’re cool now.



The rest of the day went normal, nothing notable to speak of. Me and her were just watching more TV as I typed away on my laptop.



Later tonight, I was at the pub with my friend Danny, one of the friends from high school. I noticed Jennifer wasn't there. We'd still been talking, and things were still good with us.



One positive out of all the weird fucked up shit happening lately.



Danny and I were playing a game of pool on a Friday night; the place was packed. The typical pub that would turn into a party on weekend nights.



We were chatting about some new games we've been playing lately. I was telling him how many hours I stacked in the Oblivion remake.



The overhead lights flickered from the usual warm, cozy tint to a cool, bright one that resembled a holding cell.



I was about to take my shot with the pool cue when my concentration was broken. I noticed a group of friends drinking together at the end of the bar.



One was hunched over the bar, staring at me through his eyebrows with his head hunched under his shoulders and arms extending to the end of the bar.



His hands clenched the edge of the bartop. His mouth was gaped open while he did this.



The ambient noise of the bar, conversations, laughs, and glasses clinking all seemed to fade into obscurity as he controlled me with his stare.



I shuddered. Danny slapped my chest with the back of his hand. "Yo, you payin' attention, bro?"



"Yeah… sorry, man," I responded.



We continued our conversation and game, and for a brief second, I glanced back at the guy. He was sitting upright with his beer and wasn't even paying attention to me.



He was so caught up with his buddies that there was no way he could've even noticed me.



"I've been pretty into the new Death Stranding game. I know the gameplay isn't for everybody, but I really enjoy the grind." Danny said to me.



"Yeah, I mean more power to you, man, but it's not my thing. I do like the main actor from that game, though. Boondock Saints is one of my all-time favorite movies." I said in return.



"You know, that's funny because you actually kinda *look* like that guy." He said with a casual chuckle.



I shot a look at him so quickly that he probably would've thought I was pissed off for a second if I didn’t quickly regain my composure.



I didn't tell him how nobody close to me has been saying things like this, not like how everyone else was telling me. I was frustrated, but I hid it well.



I just said, "Oh, that's crazy… I guess I never thought about that." I quickly tried redirecting the conversation elsewhere. So, the night continued on.



Afterwards, we left the bar and went our separate ways.



I was driving home when I glanced in the rearview mirror. That same guy from the bar was in my backseat, slumped over again.



His gaping mouth stretched far beyond what I could see in the reflection. He was pointing at me.



The low hum returned in my head, followed by a voice that said, “It’s almost time.”



I was so petrified that I couldn’t even get a scream out. And just before I knew it, gone. Again.



Faint whispering came to me again, this time from the radio. I swear I never turned it on.
