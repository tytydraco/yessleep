When my daughter Lily went missing for six days, I knew she was in the hospital somewhere. I was certain, because I'd never left my post at the children's ward reception desk. Not once. Not even to sleep.

But on the seventh day, someone pointed out that I didn't work there.

I never had.

They showed me my real ID – I'm a high school English teacher. Or was. Before Lily got sick. Before I started sitting at this desk, watching other people's children walk in and out. Before I began logging their names in a ledger that, apparently, doesn't exist.

"Mr. Parker," Dr. Reeves says gently, "you've been sitting at an empty desk for six days. There is no ledger. There is no computer. You've been writing in the air."

I look down. The familiar leather-bound book, the computer monitor, the stack of visitor passes – they fade like smoke when I try to focus on them.

But I remember every child's name I've logged. Every parent's signature.

"Where's Lily?" I ask again.

Dr. Reeves exchanges glances with the security guard. "Perhaps we should talk in my office."

"No." I stay seated. "I need to watch the desk. In case she comes back."

"Mr. Parker," he says carefully, "Lily was never admitted to this hospital."

"That's not true." My fingers trace patterns on the empty desk. "She had leukemia. Stage four. We brought her here on..." I falter. When was it?

"Your daughter died three years ago," Dr. Reeves says softly. "At Mount Sinai Children's Hospital. Not here."

"No." I shake my head. "No, that's not... I've been keeping track. In the ledger. Every child who comes in, every child who goes out. She has to be here somewhere. They're all here somewhere."

Dr. Reeves pulls up a chair. "Tell me about the ledger."

So I do. I tell him about the thick leather book that appeared on my desk that first day. How each page listed children's names in elegant script – when they arrived, where they went.

I tell him about the patterns I noticed. How some children were listed as "transferred" but never seemed to reach their destinations. How certain room numbers repeated. How some names appeared multiple times, years apart, but with the same parents' signatures.

"And then," I whisper, "I started seeing them."

"Seeing who?"

"The children who don't leave." I point to the corner of the waiting room. "Like her."

A small girl in a faded yellow dress stands there. Her hair is in pigtails. She holds a teddy bear missing one eye.

No one else seems to notice her.

"Emily Winters," I say. "Admitted June 15th, 1987. Never checked out."

The girl waves at me. Her hand passes through the wall.

"And him." I gesture to a boy reading a comic book that hasn't been published since 1995. "Tommy Chen. Scheduled for routine appendectomy. Listed as 'transferred' but never arrived anywhere."

More children fade into view as I name them. Dozens. Hundreds. All in clothes from different eras. All slightly transparent. All wearing hospital bracelets with that same repeated room number: 738.

"Mr. Parker," Dr. Reeves says, "there is no seventh floor in this hospital."

"I know." I open the ledger only I can see. "That's what made me look deeper. Made me start cross-referencing names. Dates. Patterns."

I show him the pages only I can read. "See? Every third Tuesday, a child is admitted and listed as 'transferred' to room 738. Different names, different years, but always that room. Always on a Tuesday. Always children with terminal diagnoses who miraculously 'transfer' before their expected deaths."

The ghost children draw closer.

"What are you suggesting?" Dr. Reeves asks.

"I'm not suggesting anything." I turn to the latest entry. "I'm telling you what the hospital is doing. Has been doing. For decades."

I point to the name on the page:

*Lily Parker. Admitted: Tuesday. Status: Transferred to Room 738. Signed: Dr. James Reeves.*

Dr. Reeves goes very still.

"You see," I say quietly, "I remembered wrong. Lily didn't die at Mount Sinai. We brought her here, to you. On a Tuesday."

The ghost children are all around us now. Some hold hands. Some clutch toys. All stare at Dr. Reeves.

"You promised to cure her," I continue. "Said you had a revolutionary treatment. A way to help terminal children. And technically, you didn't lie. They don't die, do they? Not really. They just... transfer."

Dr. Reeves stands slowly. "Security—"

"Won't help," I interrupt. "They can't see what's happening. No one can. Except those of us who've learned to read the ledger."

The ghost children move closer. Emily Winters reaches for Dr. Reeves' hand with her translucent fingers.

"What do you want?" he whispers.

"I want my daughter back." I stand, the ledger heavy in my hands. "And so do they. All of them. Every parent who trusted you. Every child who was 'transferred' to your miracle treatment in room 738."

"You don't understand," he says. "They were dying. All of them. I found a way to preserve them. To keep them alive, in a way. They don't suffer. They don't age. They're perfect."

"They're trapped," I correct him. "But not for much longer."

I open the ledger to its final page. Write one last entry:

*Dr. James Reeves. Status: Transferred to Room 738.*

The ghost children smile. 

Dr. Reeves backs away, but there's nowhere to go. The children surround him, their transparent hands reaching, teaching. I watch as they pull something from him – something bright and squirming. His essence. His soul.

He doesn't scream. They never do.

When it's over, Dr. Reeves still stands there, still breathes, still moves. But his eyes are empty now. Transparent. Like theirs.

I make one final entry:

*All children in Room 738. Status: Released.*

The ghost children begin to fade. But not before Lily runs to me, her arms wrapping around my waist in a cold embrace. 

"Thank you, Daddy," she whispers.

Then she's gone. They all are.

Except for Dr. Reeves, who will spend eternity in Room 738. Alone.

I close the ledger and place it on the empty desk. Someone else will find it eventually. Someone else will learn to read it. To see the patterns.

To understand what happens to children who get "transferred" on Tuesdays.

But for now, my job is done. My daughter is free.

I stand, straighten my tie, and walk out of the hospital I never worked at.

Behind me, Dr. Reeves takes my place at the empty desk.

He'll be there forever, logging names that don't exist in a ledger only the damned can read.

After all, someone has to keep track of the children.

Someone always has to keep track.
