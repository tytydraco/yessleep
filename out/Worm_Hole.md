Even though I absolutely hated straying deep into the wilderness, I humoured my brother for his birthday weekend. Peter wanted to look for areas to place a trail cam. Those areas were, of course, a click off the dirt road that even then had no cell service. 

The heat was sweltering, I can imagine anyone living in North America right now is feeling the effects of the heat wave. I wore shorts and a tank top. Call me unprepared if you'd like, but wearing anything more would feel like torture. Even in the shade I was sweating buckets. 

I was also bleeding.

"Hold on a sec, dammit!" I hissed at my brother ahead. I inspected my leg and noticed slim slice in my leg, embedded inside was a couple thorns. 

"You all good?" Peter asked me. 

I carefully plucked the thorns from my leg. "Yeah, probably those rose bushes we passed by."

I could still see the truck behind me, we weren't that far in. I just wanted to run back to it, crank the AC, and wait it out; However, I couldn't leave my brother on his own. 

Despite the discomfort, the area he insisted we trek in was pretty breathtaking. A small creek, tall trees, the humming of bugs and chirping of birds all made the agonizing journey picturesque at the very least. I finished snapping a few photos when I heard something. 

It sounded like a tree collapsing. I know my brother heard it, too. My biggest fear was running into a bear or a mountain lion in the woods. Even with his gun drawn, I still didn't feel comfortable.

"Please tell me that's just the wind," I said, quietly. 

My brother shouted some random nonsense, alerting any bears or whatnot to our presence. Smart. After waiting for about a minute for another noise, my brother put his gun away.

"Looks like you might be right, there's definitely some rotting trees here," he assured me. I did feel the wind on my skin, and it was soothing.

We didn't walk for much longer, eventually we settled on a tree that faced what looked like an obvious animal trail. Heck, the area showed lots of signs of antler rubbings against lots of the trees. 

I helped my brother set up the camera against a large aspen. I may hate the deep isolation of the woods, but I did like helping him set up tech. 

I noticed something a small distance from the tree, on the opposite side of where the camera was facing. It looked like a sinkhole. 

I walked over to it while Peter did the final adjustments on the trail cam. Up close, the hole stunk of death, and it appeared to be very deep. 

"Check this shit out!" I waved to Peter, still processing a cough from the stench. 

My brother immediately drew his gun and he became on high alert. It made me nervous myself. He took a few, noticeable sniffs to the air.

"That's probably a bear cache. Something might be close," he said, eyes darting around our surroundings. 

"Like a bear?" I asked, voice creaking with nervousness. 

"Yep, use your ears," he said sternly. 

Strangely enough, using my ears made me notice a discrepancy. Nothing was making a sound, no birds, no insects, nothing. The only noise I could hear was my own breathing. 

"Silent, usually means a predator,: I heard Peter say. 

With this silence as somewhat of a cue, my eyes turned upwards to the trees. There were only a few trees that had branches that could support a mountain lion. I quickly but carefully glanced at every tree branch I could. 

I decided to shout some random nonsense in hopes of attracting the thing to move. Nothing budged. Weirded out, my brother and I decided to back away slowly and bolt for the truck when we thought we were clear enough from that "cache" that my brother had been alert about. 

After taking a few paces back we heard a shrill scream. It sounded like a wounded rabbit in a trap. Immediately our eyes begin darting around the woods. However it didn't take too long to pinpoint the sound. 

It was coming from the hole. 

We ducked behind some trees. The hole was making these horrific sounds for about a minute before I noticed something moving ahead in the woods. 

Wasn't a bear, but a coyote. It was trotting excitedly towards our direction. I didn't know what to do, but my brother had a clear shot on it. When I re-adjusted myself, I realized that the thing may have smelt me from the cut in my leg. Least it was just a coyote. 

Was.

The coyote went straight for the hole. Inspecting the screaming, and sniffing around. Then something strange happened.

The hole moved, it expanded, swallowing up the poor coyote. And just like that, the screaming rabbit noises ceased. 

Wanting to waste zero time, my brother and I made a break for it. We could hear the sound of collapsing trees sinking. The hole was following us, and clearly swallowing up trees. This had to have been what I'd heard before. 

We are still a good distance from the truck when I snagged a root and tripped. I cracked my nose on the forest floor. I cupped my bleeding nose in frustration when I heard something impossible. 

I heard my fiancé Yasmine, screaming right behind me. 

"Help me! Save me!" it sounded all distorted, like it was coming from underground. 

I looked back in shock, and noticed a hole opening up where I had fallen and caused my nose to bleed. I could see what I could only assume was the culprit.

Though it was covered in soil. I saw a crude mix between an earthworm and a human head. It looked like a worm, with eyes, a nose, and a tongue of a human. It had hair, but no ears. The tongue of this monster flicked in my direction. 

 I didn't stop, but Peter and I were both terrified as this new hole formed, and the thing below was hunting us down. 

"Don't run from me!" it demanded in my fiancé's voice. 

"Shut up!" I yelled back it. 

"Don't let up bro, were almost at the truck!" I heard Peter call out ahead. 

"Thank god!" I yelled at Peter. 

I saw the rose bush I had cut myself earlier on. It gave me hope for a little bit.

A scream that sounded like Peter's came from the bush. It too was swallowed ip by the worm, digging itself halfway out of the ground itself. 

"What the fuck!?" I heard my actual brother yell in confusion and terror. I felt something slice the back of my arm. It was the tongue form that thing! 

"Shit!" I grunted, clutching my arm. I felt like I was bleeding so much that I'd be done for. I began to almost run in peace, accepting this monster may devour me. 

Hearing the truck start up in the distance snapped me back to reality. Looking at me I saw the worm thing's sickly pale eyes staring at me. It began vibrating its head rapidly, making sounds similar to the nonsense my brother and I had made earlier.

I threw open the passenger door as fast as I could, and slammed it so hard it could've broken. Peter got  in quickly and we drove off. Heck, I don't even know if my brother wants to review his trail cam footage. If its really a worm, we'd have to wait for some colder seasons in order to not risk getting swallowed up. Worms retreat underground in colder temperatures, right?

  
If you see a hole in the forest floor, do not linger.
